After all , DT former headquarters of Chase Manhattan Bank , located deep in DT heart of DT financial district and which was built by its then chairman David Rockefeller , is a remnant to another NN – a NN when banking was about providing loans , not about managing and trading assets which has become DT realm of Midtown NNP York , and since JPM already has extensive Midtown exposure with its offices at 270 , 270 and 245 Park , DT 1 CMP building always stood out as a bit of a sore thumb . Of course , as Zero Hedge readers first learned , DT big surprise is literally below DT surface , some 90 feet below street level to be exact , where DT formerly secret JPM gold vault is located , which RB happens to be DT biggest commercial gold vault in DT NN . PRP was only a month ago when PRP learned IN JPM was planning to exit DT physical commodity business , and today PRP VBP IN DT firm is set on disposing of its CD crowning asset in DT commercial gold vaulting industry . This begs DT question : is JPM set to fully and completely exit DT precious metals vertical which PRP inherited when PRP was handed Bear Stearns on a $ 10 platter ( together with DT now defunct firm ’s legacy short positions ) ? If so , is PRP RB in DT process of unwinding any and all legacy precious metals exposure including rumored “ whale - sized ” shorts in DT paper silver and / or gold axes , and what happens to DT price of silver and gold when a massive stock position becomes “ flow ” in DT other direction ( i.e. , short covering ) ? Finally , if indeed JPM is getting out dodge , is EX some hope IN a semblance of normalcy will return to a market best known for DT AM - PM closing fix arbitrage , as well as DT occasional bid stack take out slam and close ( and open ) banging ? Or , will DT buyer of DT building , and vault , be none other than DT Federal Reserve , which will merely take this opportunity to merge its own , and DT NN ’s largest commercial gold vaults , which just happen to be located next to each other and connected by tunnel deep below DT ironically named Liberty Street ? Inquiring minds certainly VBP to VB . More from Bloomberg on DT sale process : JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) is seeking to sell 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza , DT lower Manhattan tower built by David Rockefeller in DT late 1950s , as DT company reduces its office space in DT city . DT bank MD relocate about 4,000 employees , most of DT NNS who work in DT 60 - story skyscraper , to other NNP York locations , VBD Brian Marchiony , a spokesman . JPMorgan occupies about half of DT space in 2.2 million - square - foot ( 204,000 - square - meter ) building , according to CoStar Group Inc. ( CSGP ) , a Washington - based firm WDT follows office leasing . DT building MD fetch at least $ 600 million , according to a person with knowledge of DT offering . DT cost to buyers MD be higher because PRP MD assume any conversion expenses , VBD DT person , who asked not to be identified because DT discussions are private . An offering of DT tower , a city landmark designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft , MD test DT downtown office market . Shrinking financial companies have left lower Manhattan landlords with at least 6.3 million square feet of space to fill , according to data from brokerage Newmark Knight Frank Grubb . DT tower MD achieve its highest value as a mixed - use property , with a hotel , additional retail or apartments added , VBD Dan Fasulo , managing director of Real Capital Analytics Inc. , a NNP York - based research firm WDT tracks commercial real estate sales . “ PRP MD do a department store in DT base , ” he VBD . “ PRP ’s a very exciting potential mixed - use opportunity , in my mind . I VBP DT market will receive PRP very well . ” And DT vault in DT basement , “ longer than a football field , ” MD become a restaurant or a paintball arena ? For those who missed PRP , here is DT excerpt from DT exclusive Zero Hedge expose shining some light on DT NN ’s biggest and now supposedly almost empty , commercial gold vault . From : Why Is JPMorgan ’s Gold Vault , DT Largest In DT NNP , Located Next To DT NNP York Fed’s ? Curiously ( or perhaps not at all ) , when DT CME on behalf of JPM submitted DT certification filing alongside DT comparable such supplements as filed by Brinks above , PRP requested a FOIA ( Freedom of Information Act ) confidential treatment . As a reminder , to be eligible for FOIA exemption status DT protected information must be of vital importance to DT nation ’s safety . This is precisely what JPM thought DT details surrounding its NNP York vault are . To wit : Pursuant to Sections 8 and 8 ( a ) of DT Commodity Exchange Act ( “ CEA ” ) , as amended , and Commission Regulation 145.9 ( d ) , NYMEX and COMEX request confidential treatment of Appendix A , Appendix B , and this letter on DT grounds IN disclosure of Appendix A and / or Appendix B MD reveal confidential commercial information of DT submitters ( NYMEX and COMEX ) and of other persons . Pursuant to Commission Regulation 145.9(d ) ( 5 ) , NYMEX and COMEX request IN confidential treatment be maintained for Appendix A and Appendix B until further notice from DT Exchanges . PRP RB request IN DT Commission notify DT undersigned immediately after receiving any FOIA request for VBN Appendix A , Appendix B or any other court order , subpoena or summons for same . Finally , PRP request IN PRP be notified in DT event DT Commission intends to disclose such Appendix A and / or Appendix B to Congress or to any other governmental agency or unit pursuant to Section 8 of DT CEA . NYMEX and COMEX do not waive their notification rights under Section 8 ( f ) of DT CEA with respect to any subpoena or summons for such Appendix A or Appendix B. Please contact DT undersigned at ( 212 ) 299-2207 should PRP have any questions concerning this letter . Yet oddly enough , DT FOIA request letter itself , while RB being filed with a request for Confidential Treatment , never got PRP . As a result PRP was posted at this address . Ooops . But a far bigger oops , is IN on DT first page of VBD declassified confidential FOIA app , in black ink , PRP VBP DT missing piece : And so , despite DT extended attempts at secrecy , PRP finally hit DT proverbial goldmine vault . So what do PRP VB about 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza . Well , aside from DT fact IN DT 60 - story structure , built in DT 1950s , was DT headquarters of DT once - legendary Chase Manhattan corporation , and which when PRP was built was DT NN ’s sixth tallest building , not much . So PRP set off to learn more . To learn more , PRP first went to DT motherlode : DT Landmarks Preservation Commission , whose report on 1 CMP describes everyone PRP wants to VB about this building and then much more , such as DT : So DT old Chase HQ , once DT stomping grounds of CD David Rockefeller , and soon to be DT other half of JPMorgan Chase , has 5 sub - basements , just IN DT NY Fed … Or , about DT same depth as DT bottom - most sub- basement under DT NY Fed … But then PRP hit DT jackpot : And RB PRP have PRP : DT JPM vault , recommissioned to become a commercial vault , just happens to RB be DT “ NN ’s largest bank vault . ” Digging some more into DT curious nature of this biggest bank vault in DT NN , PRP learn DT following , courtesy of a freely available book written by CD of DT architects : In other words , DT NN ’s biggest bank vault , IN belonging to DT private Chase Manhattan empire , and then , to JPMorgan , was so safe , DT creators even had a plan of action should PRP sustain a near - direct hit from a nuclear bomb , and suffer epic flooding ( such as DT from Hurricane Sandy ) . PRP is no surprise , then , IN DT street entrance to this NN ’s biggest vault located under 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza makes DT entrance to any medieval impregnable fortress seem IN child ’s play in comparison . Courtesy of Google StreetView : Yet PRP is not what is on this side of DT street , which just happens to be known as Liberty Street , DT is what is DT most interesting part of this whole story . PRP is what is on DT other : DT ’s right , ladies and gentlemen , as a result of our cursory examination , PRP have learned IN DT NN ’s largest private , and commercial , gold vault , WDT belonging once upon a NN to Chase Manhattan , and now to JPMorgan Chase , is located , right across DT street , and at DT same level underground , resting just on top of DT Manhattan bedrock , as DT vault belonging to DT NNP York Federal Reserve , which according to folklore is DT official location of DT biggest collection of sovereign , JJ gold in DT NN . At this point PRP MD hate to be self - referential , and point out what CD of our own commentators noted on DT topic of DT Fed ’s vault a NN ago , namely DT : … but PRP wo n’t , and instead PRP will let readers make up their own mind why DT DT thousands of tons of sovereign gold in DT possession of DT NNP York Fed , have to be literally inches across , if not directly connected , to DT largest private gold vault in DT NN . PRP VBP readers can do a good enough job on their own . This article was posted : Monday , August CD , 2013 at 4:46 am"

At a central banking conference on Thursday , NNP York Fed NNP John Williams argued for pre-emptive measures to avoid having to deal with too low inflation and interest rates . DT sent DT dollar down before PRP bounced slightly in early Asian trade , after a NNP York Fed representative subsequently VBD Williams ’ comments were academic and not about immediate policy direction . Still , investors took his remarks along with separate comments from Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida as another dovish signal from DT central bank , which MD be opening DT way for a big rate cut at DT end of this month . DT dollar stood at 107.42 yen , up 0.2 % from late U.S. levels after having hit a three - week low of 107.21 DT previous day . DT euro eased slightly to $ 1.1266 from $ 1.1282 . On DT week , DT dollar is down 0.4 % versus DT yen and 0.1 % on DT euro . DT dollar index , which hit a two - week low of 96.648 , bounced to 96.792 . DT greenback fell broadly on Thursday after Williams ’ remarks bolstered bets IN DT Fed MD cut interest rates by 50 basis points , rather than 25 basis points . Williams VBD when rates and inflation are low , policymakers cannot afford to keep their “ powder dry ” and wait for potential JJ problems to materialise . DT is especially true with neutral rates WDT MD neither restrict nor accelerate DT U.S. economy , he VBD . When adjusted for inflation , DT neutral rate is near DT Fed ’s current policy rate , which is in a range of 2.25 - 2.50 % . Financial markets reacted quickly , with money market futures pricing in almost a 70 % chance of a 50 basis point cut at its policy meeting on July 30 - 31 at CD point . DT odds eased to around 40 % after DT NNP York Fed ’s clarification of his speech . All DT same , Williams ’ rate - cut view was echoed by Fed Vice Chair Clarida , who told Fox Business Network DT central bank might have to act early and not wait “ until things VBP so bad ” . “ Williams ’ comments were surprisingly dovish . DT NY Fed went all DT way to try to modify DT message but no NN seems to have done so for Clarida , who RB VBD a very similar thing , ” VBD Daisuke Uno , chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank . DT dollar ’s weakness RB underpinned JJ emerging market currencies . MSCI ’s emerging market currency index has risen 0.35 % so far this week to a four - month high of 1,657.07 , coming within sight of this NN ’s double peak around 1,658 , hit in late January and March . DT Brazilian real rose to five - month high of 3.7172 to DT dollar on Thursday while DT South African rand RB scaled a five - month peak of 13.8175 and last stood at 13.855 . “ If DT Fed cut rates , DT MD encourage fresh investments in emerging currencies and other risk assets , ” VBD Bart Wakabayashi , NNP Street Bank ’s representative in Japan . Elsewhere , DT pound remained firm following stronger - than - expected UK retail sales numbers and after British lawmakers on Thursday approved proposals to make PRP harder for DT next prime minister to force through a no - deal Brexit by suspending parliament . DT pound stood at $ 1.2552 , flat in Asia after 0.93 % gains overnight , though PRP was DT worst performer among G10 currencies so far this week , with a loss of 0.2 % . DT biggest stride was made by DT NNP Zealand dollar , which is up 1.3 % for DT week at a 3 - 1/2 - month high of $ 0.6785 , as DT Fed ’s anticipated monetary easing is seen boosting DT relative yield attraction of DT kiwi . DT currency has DT second highest bond yield among G10 currencies after DT U.S. dollar . ( Reporting by Hideyuki Sano ; Editing by Sam Holmes & Shri Navaratnam )"

Described by some terrified witnesses as a monkey , by others as a chimpanzee and as “ anything ’s possible ” by police , a sense of apprehension is spreading . DT unidentified humanoid has been repeatedly spotted in DT city of Santa Fe , with CD witness claiming PRP saw DT beast attempt to snatch a cat . DT alarm was first raised in DT early hours of Monday , when a woman named Patricia de la Mora called DT police to say she had seen some kind of primate causing pandemonium on DT corner of 24th and East Bellaire streets in DT south west of DT city . She had apparently been woken up after midnight by thunder and lightning , and after urging her husband to look out of DT window when she heard “ strange noises ” , eventually got out of bed herself , opened DT curtains and was “ paralysed by fear ” . “ I look out DT window and I see PRP was in RB . PRP was a monkey , a big NN , ” she told NNP NN outlet KVUE . Ms de la Mora VBD she did not have NN to VB her phone , but stood at her bedroom window stunned by what she saw . “ He tried to find something , ” she VBD . “ He looked over RB , then he looked over RB , and I closed DT curtain . I did n’t VB him to see me . ” But when police arrived DT creature had vanished , and despite an hour - long search , all trace of DT supposed animal had RB evaporated . However , DT enigmatic agitator soon struck again . DT following day , police received a similar report from DT same part of town , from a woman who claimed she spent 20 minutes hiding in her car . Local NN station KHOU - TV , quoted DT woman as saying on Facebook : “ Just had a monkey try to attack me , while checking my mail . I ’ve spent DT last 20 minutes in my car . ” Police again launched a futile search for any physical manifestation of DT supposed monkey 's existence . Several residents in DT area then reported on social NN PRP had seen a monkey , with CD person claiming DT creature had tried to kidnap their cat , and another saying a child has RB been “ attacked ” . Police have VBN PRP cannot confirm any of DT sightings but acknowledged PRP MD well be true . TV reporters have been sent to DT area . “ Certified primate teams are out here , right now , in DT Santa Fe area , ” Fox NNP reported . “ Law enforcement actually flew drones around DT area , but PRP ’re told no monkey was spotted , ” Natalie Hee , Fox ’s reporter on DT ground , told viewers .

DT picture is to verify what type of monkey this is . Knowing DT type will keep this monkey safe if PRP needs to be tranquilised . • Do not VB searching for DT monkey .

This_DT article_NN was_VBD posted_VBN :_: Friday_NNP ,_, June_NNP 19_CD ,_, 2009_CD at_IN 10:02_CD am_NN","Furious protests are threatening to undermine DT Iraqi NN ’s plan to give international oil companies a stake in its giant oilfields in a desperate effort to increase its declining oil production and oil revenues . In less than two weeks NN , on June 29 and 30 , DT Iraqi Oil minister Hussain Shahristani will award service contracts to DT NN ’s largest oil companies to develop six of Iraq ’s largest oil producing fields over 20 - 25 NNS . Senior figures within DT Iraqi oil industry have denounced DT deal . Fayad al - Nema , DT director of DT South Oil Company , which comes under DT Oil Ministry and produces most of Iraq ’s crude , VBD last weekend : “ DT service contracts will put DT Iraqi economy in chains and shackle its independence for DT next 20 NNS . PRP squander Iraq ’s revenues . ” Mr Nema is reported to have since been fired because of his opposition to DT contracts , which he says is shared by JJ other officials in Iraq ’s NN - owned oil industry . DT NN maintains IN PRP is not compromising DT ownership of Iraq ’s huge oil reserves – DT third in DT NN at 115 billion barrels – on which DT country is wholly dependent to fund its recovery from 30 NNS of war , sanctions and occupation . But DT fall in DT price of oil over DT last NN has left DT NN facing a devastating financial crisis in which 80 per cent of its revenues goes to pay for salaries , food rations and recurrent costs . Almost nothing is left for reconstruction and PRP is finding PRP hard to pay even for vitally - needed items such as electrical plant from GE and Siemens . DT development of Iraq ’s oil reserves is of great importance to DT NN ’s NN supply in DT 21st century . PRP MD be even larger than Saudi Arabia ’s , as EX was little exploration while Iraq was ruled by Saddam Hussein . International oil companies are desperate to VB their foot in DT door . “ Everyone wants to be in Iraq , ” says Ruba Husari , an expert on Iraqi oil . “ Togethor with Iran this is DT only oil province in DT NN WDT has great potential . PRP is a great opportunity for oil companies because nobody knows DT size of Iraq ’s reserves . Iraq itself needs to VB what is under its soil . ” But Iraqis are wary of DT involvement of big foreign oil companies in raising production in super giant fields IN Kirkuk and Bai Hassan in DT north and Rumaila , Zubair and West Qurna in DT south . PRP suspect IN DT NNP invasion of 2003 was ultimately aimed at securing western control of their oil wealth . DT nationalization of DT Iraqi oil industry by Saddam Hussein in 1972 remains popular . DT rebellion against DT service contracts has been gathering pace all this week . Parliament is demanding IN bidding should be delayed . MPs summoned Mr Shahristani , a nuclear scientist imprisoned and tortured under Saddam Hussein , to answer questions about DT service contracts and DT fall in Iraq ’s oil production and exports . Jabir Khalifa Kabir , DT secretary of parliament ’s oil and gas committee , claims DT JJ contracts will “ chain DT NN with complex contractual terms ” and will abort South Oil Company ’s own plans to raise production . DT NN says DT bidding must VB ahead . DT JJ contracts are not in fact particularly favorable to DT international oil companies . PRP are rather DT outcome of DT companies ’ extreme eagerness to VB into Iraq and DT NN ’s attempt to obtain expertise and investment without ceding control . DT companies will be paid a fee linked to first restoring and then increasing oil output . PRP will , however , have greater control when EX is a second round of bidding for oilfields which have been discovered but not developed . Separate again is DT question of exploring for JJ oil reserves . Critics of DT deal in parliament say IN Iraq has already invested $ 8 billion in developing its super giant fields . But Mr Shahristani needs an investment of $ 50 billion over DT next five or six NNS to raise current production from 2.5 million barrels a day of crude and he knows DT money and expertise can only come from outside Iraq . DT NN in Baghdad MD be near broke , but Iraqis ask whose fault this is . DT Oil Ministry , IN much of DT NN , is dysfunctional when PRP comes to carrying out long - term projects . Mr Shahristani is blamed for poor management skills , though he eloquently defends himself by saying IN when he took over DT ministry in 2006 he had to cope with attacks by guerrillas who once were blowing up a pipeline every day . This explains Mr Shahristani ’s problems in northern Iraq , where DT Sunni Arab insurgency of 2003 - 8 was strong , but not in DT far south where DT Shia community is dominant and EX was no uprising . Jabbar al - Luaibi , DT former head of DT South Oil Company , who battled to maintain oil production in these NNS , gave a devastating interview detailing DT failings of DT Oil Ministry to provide DT most basic equipment needed to monitor DT oil reservoirs . “ PRP ’s IN driving your car without any indicators on DT instrument panel , ” he VBD , adding IN if mismanagement continues in DT same way as in DT past “ who knows , PRP might have to start importing crude oil . ” DT Iraqi NN made two other mistakes for which PRP is now paying . PRP optimistically believed DT price of oil MD stay high at $ 140 a barrel . Instead of investing extra revenues by paying for outside expertise and equipment to raise production in DT oilfields PRP spent DT money on raising DT pay of NN employees and increasing their number . This increased Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s popularity in DT provincial elections in January , but left DT NN very short of cash when oil prices collapsed . PRP have risen since then , but not nearly enough to solve DT NN ’s problems . In June 2008 DT Iraqi oil industry seemed about to VB foreign help by signing two NN technical support contracts with major oil companies . Control MD have remained with Iraq . At DT last minute these were cancelled despite being supported by Mr Shahristani and DT council of ministers . DT reason why this happened explains much about why DT Iraqi NN machine is unable to carry out long term policies . Jobs are allocated to members of political parties regardless of their experience or abilities . After 2003 DT Oil Ministry had been DT fief of DT Fadhila , a Shia Islamic party strong in Basra , and , though PRP left DT NN , PRP never wholly accepted Mr Shahristani as minister . Showing a certain cheek Fadhila members , having sabotaged DT plan to acquire foreign expertise when money was available to buy PRP last NN , now criticize DT NN for being forced to accept worse terms this NN because PRP cannot invest itself . PRP is probably too late for DT Iraqi NN to delay or modify DT contracts to be awarded at DT end of June . PRP needs DT money too badly and PRP failed to invest itself when oil prices were high . Even when DT big oil companies start work , PRP will be three NNS before JJ oil appears . JJ Iraqis will be angered to see their historic oilfields , on which their country is wholly dependant , being partially run by foreign companies , but , facing an election next January , at this stage DT NN believes PRP has no choice .

OK , PRP 's tempting to refer to this as "" Bigfoot "" NN ... as in Bigfoot Biomedical , DT closed loop ( aka Artificial Pancreas system ) startup based in Milpitas , CA , led by an all - star D - Dad trio -- former JDRF leader Jeffrey Brewer , former Medtronic chief engineer Lane Desborough , and financial whiz Bryan Mazlish ( Mr. "" Bigfoot "" himself ) -- along with JJ others well - known in DT Diabetes Community . On Thursday July 13 , Bigfoot announced a partnership with Abbott Diabetes Care to integrate a next - generation version of their FreeStyle Libre Flash CGM system in Bigfoot 's emerging closed loop system , which MD hit market by DT end of 2020 if all goes according to DT startup 's plan . This comes just a month or so after DT NN IN Bigfoot bought DT Timesulin insulin pen tracker -- indicating IN Bigfoot 's eventual closed loop system will RB connect with smart insulin pens . Whoa , quite a powerful combo RB ! This certainly makes Bigfoot unique in DT closed loop space , being DT only developer at this point with clear plans to accommodate both insulin pumpers and pen users . Just how will all this pan out ? PRP recently spoke with Bigfoot CEO Jeffrey Brewer to learn more about DT latest developments . As a reminder , DT Abbott FreeStyle Libre is a JJ type of glucose monitor referred to as a Flash Glucose Monitoring ( FGM ) system . PRP consists of a small round quarter - sized sensor WDT 's worn on DT back of DT arm for 14 days . Data is collected from DT interstitial fluid ( just IN a regular CGM ) every minute , but unlike a traditional CGM DT user must wave a handheld receiver over DT sensor to VB readings -- and unlike current CGMs on DT market from Dexcom and Medtronic , DT first - gen Libre does not have real - NN data connectivity . CD major advantage is IN PRP does n't require any fingerstick calibration . While not yet FDA approved for DT U.S. , Libre is available in 37 other NNS since first coming to market internationally in 2014 , and was most recently cleared in Canada . EX 's a body of growing clinical NN data showing DT Libre is accurate and effective for JJ PWDs . A physician 's version called Libre Pro was FDA approved in September 2016 , but DT patient version been before DT U.S. regulatory agency since mid-2015 (! ) , and PRP 's anyone 's guess what DT holdup is . Being able to read about European patients ' experiences with Libre , American PWDs are of course anxious to VB their hands on PRP . But this JJ agreement with Bigfoot is n't about DT first - generation FreeStyle Libre we'll ( hopefully ) see on DT U.S. market very soon ; PRP 's about future technology WDT will VB beyond DT current iteration of FreeStyle Libre . Abbott 's pretty hush - hush on this , so all PRP really VBP now is IN DT JJ Libre version Bigfoot plans to use will do away with DT handheld scanner and will be able to share data directly with DT closed loop system , making PRP function more IN an existing CGM . So does this mean IN Bigfoot is breaking up with Dexcom , despite a partnership announced in July 2015 ? DT anwser is yes . Bigfoot says PRP 's been evaluating CGM partners since its inception and has now moved to Abbott exclusively . DT agreement is for four NNS , from DT start of DT system 's launch . This means each Bigfoot system will come with a Libre sensor , and customers will VB directly through Bigfoot , not between both companies . Why Abbott ? PRP 's all about calibrations -- or in DT case of Libre , no calibrations . PRP 're told DT was a deciding factor in choosing between Dexcom and Abbott . DT possibility of human error based on calibration issues was a stumbling block in designing a closed loop system WDT 's supposed to automate care , thereby "" taking away DT work "" of diabetes . While Dexcom has been pushing to drop calibrations for NNS , even their next - gen G6 is likely to require CD calibration per day . So based on DT existing Libre data worldwide , DT decision to VB with Abbott became pretty clear , Brewer tells PRP . “ In DT first generation of automated systems , PRP VBP sensors WDT require calibration have been DT crippling aspect of DT user experience . PRP ’ve learned from our own personal experiences and from what PRP ’ve seen in data modeling , IN calibration is DT biggest risk to a closed loop . NNS do n’t do PRP well , or consistently or even at all . And DT turns out to be a big problem . Our concern is IN systems WDT require calibration are n’t VBG to be as easy to use or as safe as those WDT do n’t require PRP . ” Aside from adding Libre , DT basics of DT Bigfoot system as PRP 've reported before have n't really changed in DT past couple NNS . DT "" Bigfoot Brain "" will be built around DT former Asante Snap pump technology WDT Bigfoot acquired in mid-2015 using a pre-filled insulin cartridge and tubing . This is where DT smart algorithm is housed , which does all DT calculations for carbs , insulin delivery , etc , and a Bluetooth chip inside will talk to DT Abbott Libre sensor and smartphone mobile app as DT main interface . Rather than a traditional display , PRP will have a "" belt - clip sized "" display with icons showing DT various items such as BG data and dosing . Importantly , Brewer says DT system will not have a set BG target ( as Medtronic 's current 670G does and others IN Beta Bionics are developing ) . Instead , PRP will allow flexibility by having DT system learn to adjust targets based on each individual 's BG needs -- because , Your Diabetes MD Vary . As mentioned , Bigfoot will design its system for use by NNS on injections and multiple daily dosing , too . In early June just before DT ADA Scientific Sessions , Bigfoot announced its acquisition of London - based startup Patients Pending WDT makes DT Timesulin smart insulin pen tracker . This will allow DT Libre sensor to eventually talk directly to smart pens , and transmit DT data through DT Bigfoot smartphone app interface . "" I do n’t VB why NNS are forced to be a pump person or a shots person . Why ca n’t PRP do both , using whatever fits their life at DT point in NN ? Some NNS switch back and forth , and I VBP PRP should be able to , "" Brewer says . "" When PRP talk about consumerization , DT ’s a fancy term for just looking at DT person and designing a system around their needs . DT ’s what Apple does , but PRP ’s not traditionally what JJ device companies do . DT 's what Bigfoot is doing . ” DT clinical research is underway and will be DT main focus for DT foreseeable future : • A clinical research NN ( CRC ) NN took place during DT latter half of 2016 and wrapped up last NN , and DT results from DT have been encouraging . • Pivotal trials are expected to start in early 2018 , and Bigfoot says PRP 's working with FDA on what DT research will look IN . Once all those begin , details will be shared via ClinicalTrials.gov and DT Bigfoot site itself . • Much remains up in DT air and some will be dictated by Abbott 's timing , but Bigfoot hopes for approval by 2020 . DT planned launch is now more than a NN later than originally expected , which is disappointing -- not only for PRP on DT consumer side , but for Bigfoot folks too . Their team of 50 NNS includes JJ living with type 1 themselves or a very personal D - connection , such as DT founders being D - parents . But Bigfoot never planned to be first -- Medtronic holds DT distinction with its Minimed 670G hybrid closed loop , which got FDA approval in late 2016 and is now being slowly rolled out across DT NNP NNPS . PRP will eventually have a next - gen , more - automated model of a closed loop , and PRP 're RB expecting to see other products from Tandem and Type Zero Tech , Insulet , and Beta Bionics in DT coming NNS . Not to mention DT hundreds of ( non-regulated ) do - PRP - yourself homemade closed loop systems being used worldwide over DT past couple NNS ( including some by Bigfoot team members ) . PRP is n't about being first , but getting PRP right and bringing something to market WDT changes DT game , Brewer emphasizes . In DT past , Bigfoot has mentioned plans to adopt a monthly subscription model for this closed loop system , which PRP expect will cost less than combined pump / BG testing / CGM supplies cost today . PRP 're happy to hear IN DT Bigfoot team has been conscious of access and cost considerations since DT start , and remain focused to making sure this can VB into DT hands of NNS who VBP PRP . No doubt , a lot will VB over DT next few NNS and PRP are confident Bigfoot will adapt as needed -- whether via a bundled - subscription business model ( CD of DT most novel aspects of what Bigfoot 's proposing ) , or changes in insurance and Medicare coverage . Certainly , JJ will be surprised IN Bigfoot is dropping DT best - in - class Dexcom CGM for a device WDT 's still mostly unknown in DT U.S. PRP 's odd to be asked to imagine a NN of no calibrations , and to put our faith in a future product WDT in its first - gen offers comparatively limited data capabilities . DT 's a lot to ask , especially when so JJ in our D - community are highly impatient and VBP improved technology NOW . See RB : # WeAreNotWaiting . JJ RB remember DT FreeStyle Navigator CGM WDT Abbott discontinued in DT U.S. back in 2011 , but remains on DT market internationally ; PRP was seen as DT best , better - than - Dexcom at DT NN and as a botched business move WDT PRP did n't succeed here in DT NNPS . Along with all DT test strip recalls and customer service issues at Abbott , DT company 's D - tech has often been engulfed in storm clouds ... but DT fact remains , Abbott has some stellar technology . For our part , PRP 're excited to hear about this latest collaboration , and can't wait to see what materializes . In other words , DT future looks bright and PRP continue to # BelieveInBigfoot as PRP moves forward with JJ options for better diabetes care !"

After DT most severe pain subsides , some joint discomfort MD last from a few days to a few weeks . Later attacks are likely to last longer and affect more joints . • Inflammation and redness . DT affected joint or joints become swollen , tender , warm and red . • Limited range of motion . As gout progresses , PRP MD not be able to move your joints normally . When to see a doctor If PRP experience sudden , intense pain in a joint , call your doctor . Gout WDT goes untreated can lead to worsening pain and joint damage . Seek JJ care immediately if PRP have a fever and a joint is hot and inflamed , which can be a sign of infection . Gout occurs when urate crystals accumulate in your joint , causing DT inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack . Urate crystals can form when PRP have high levels of uric acid in your blood . Your body produces uric acid when PRP breaks down purines — substances WDT are found naturally in your body . Purines are RB found in certain foods , such as steak , organ meats and seafood . Other foods RB promote higher levels of uric acid , such as alcoholic beverages , especially beer , and drinks sweetened with fruit sugar ( fructose ) . Normally , uric acid dissolves in your blood and passes through your kidneys into your urine . But sometimes either your body produces too much uric acid or your kidneys excrete too little uric acid . When this happens , uric acid can build up , forming sharp , needlelike urate crystals in a joint or surrounding tissue WDT cause pain , inflammation and swelling . PRP 're more likely to develop gout if PRP have high levels of uric acid in your body . Factors WDT increase DT uric acid level in your body include : • Diet . Eating a diet rich in meat and seafood and drinking beverages sweetened with fruit sugar ( fructose ) increase levels of uric acid , which increase your risk of gout . Alcohol consumption , especially of beer , RB increases DT risk of gout . • Obesity . If PRP 're overweight , your body produces more uric acid and your kidneys have a more difficult NN eliminating uric acid . • JJ conditions . Certain diseases and conditions increase your risk of gout . These include untreated high blood pressure and chronic conditions such as diabetes , metabolic syndrome , and heart and kidney diseases . • Certain medications . DT use of thiazide diuretics — commonly used to treat hypertension — and low - dose aspirin RB can increase uric acid levels . So can DT use of anti-rejection drugs prescribed for NNS who have undergone an organ transplant . • Family history of gout . If other members of your family have had gout , PRP 're more likely to develop DT NN . • Age and sex . Gout occurs more often in men , primarily because women tend to have lower uric acid levels . After menopause , however , women 's uric acid levels approach those of men . Men are RB more likely to develop gout earlier — usually between DT ages of 30 and 50 — whereas women generally develop signs and symptoms after menopause . • Recent surgery or trauma . Experiencing recent surgery or trauma has been associated with an increased risk of developing a gout attack . NNS with gout can develop more - severe conditions , such as : • Recurrent gout . Some NNS MD never experience gout signs and symptoms again . Others MD experience gout several times each NN . Medications MD help prevent gout attacks in NNS with recurrent gout . If left untreated , gout can cause erosion and destruction of a joint . • Advanced gout . Untreated gout MD cause deposits of urate crystals to form under DT skin in nodules called tophi ( TOE - fie ) . Tophi can develop in several areas such as your fingers , hands , feet , elbows or Achilles tendons along DT backs of your ankles . Tophi usually are n't painful , but PRP can become swollen and tender during gout attacks . • Kidney stones . Urate crystals MD collect in DT urinary tract of NNS with gout , causing kidney stones . Medications can help reduce DT risk of kidney stones . During symptom - free periods , these dietary guidelines MD help protect against future gout attacks : • Drink plenty of fluids . Stay well - hydrated , including plenty of NN . Limit how JJ sweetened beverages PRP drink , especially those sweetened with high - fructose corn syrup . • Limit or avoid alcohol . Talk with your doctor about whether any amount or type of alcohol is safe for PRP . Recent evidence suggests IN beer MD be particularly likely to increase DT risk of gout symptoms , especially in men . • VB your protein from low - fat dairy products . Low - fat dairy products MD actually have a protective effect against gout , so these are your best - bet protein sources . • Limit your intake of meat , fish and poultry . A small amount MD be tolerable , but pay close attention to what types — and how much — seem to cause problems for PRP . • Maintain a desirable body weight . Choose portions WDT allow PRP to maintain a healthy weight . Losing weight MD decrease uric acid levels in your body . But avoid fasting or rapid weight loss , since doing so MD temporarily raise uric acid levels ."

Sergei Bubnovsky is a professor from Moscow who has an innovating JJ technique WDT can help PRP improve your immunity and overall NN . According to DT professor , soaking your legs in an NN - cold bath for 10 - 15 seconds after coming home from work can reinforce your immune system and prepare PRP for DT fight against colds or NN . RB , a NN from England found IN taking daily cold showers increased DT numbers of NN - fighting white blood cells ( compared to NNS who took hot showers ) . DT investigators at Britain ’s Thrombosis Research Institute suggested IN as DT body tries to warm itself during and after a cold shower , metabolic rate speeds up and activates DT immune system , which leads to DT release of more white blood cells . And , according to a German NN , an occasional winter swim in cold NN causes oxidative stress , but , done regularly , such swimming leads to an adaptive antioxidant response ; in other words , DT body is better able to combat oxidative stress in general once PRP ’s accustomed to cold - NN swims . DT History of Healing With Cold NN DT ancient Indian term for very cold showers is ishnan . This refers to DT moment when your body achieves DT temperature with which PRP can defend itself against DT cold NN . Ishnan kicks in when DT cold NN first hits your skin , causing your capillaries ( small blood vessels near DT skin ’s surface ) to open . As DT cold shower continues , your capillaries close again , sending blood rushing back to your organs and glands . This natural flushing process brings youthfulness to your body by stimulating renewed glandular activity . Cold NN therapy was publicized by DT German priest Sebastian Kneipp in 1849 . DT winter , Kneipp was successfully battling tuberculosis ( a condition WDT was then incurable ) . His method was cold NN therapy , which he executed by plunging into DT frigid Danube River several times each week . Kneipp ’s 1886 book “ My NNP Cure ” , became an international bestseller . This technique is very easy to do and not only can recover your immune system PRP RB brings PRP a lot of benefits . Put cold NN in a bathtub or basin , then add as much NN as PRP can VB and soak your feet in DT tub for 10 - 15 seconds . Repeating this method every night before VBG to bed will improve your immune system quickly . Note : DT method is especially beneficial for NNS with weak immune system – in this case , soak your feet in icy NN every 4 hours . Experts advise IN cold NN therapy is not for everyone . For example , DT potential spike in blood pressure caused by cold NN MD be dangerous for those with uncontrolled high blood pressure . However , practitioners say DT therapy can be safely used to reduce mildly high blood pressure ( 150/100 and below ) or to raise low blood pressure . If PRP have any questions about your blood pressure or have n’t had PRP checked recently , PRP should see your doctor for a blood pressure test before beginning a cold - NN regimen . NN - Bath therapy is RB to be avoided in NNS of : So far PRP ’ve seen IN this is a tool to help PRP prevent future problems . PRP ’s RB great if PRP ’re suffering from a cold or DT NN !. In addition to quickly lowering your fever , your immune system will respond with strength against DT infection or germs . Your ailment will disappear within a few days and with PRP , DT discomfort WDT PRP produced . Therefore , this is a simple and inexpensive way to ward off conditions WDT threaten your daily activities . PRP RB helps PRP rest and relax your feet to face DT next day with fresh NN . PRP will help PRP unwind and RB marks DT moment when your NN for yourself begins . PRP ’re done with your obligations ."

DT Red Cross JJ efforts generate billions yet only a trickle of those amount will ever reached DT supposed intended recipients . From what PRP have experienced , PRP was DT local archbishop WDT have been entrusted with DT billions of peso donations relating to DT Guinsaugon Landslide in 2006 , and since DT church is not subject to JJ audit , DT funds disappeared in NN . What is delivered in DT disaster areas , however , is DT forced vaccinations of DT victims to introduced AIDS , hepatitis , Ebola or sterilization , so IN in DT end EX wo n’t be any survivors left . A similar scheme should be what ’s happening in Haiti and elsewhere … After raising nearly half a billion dollars for emergency disaster relief after DT 2010 Haitian earthquake – including $ 170 million earmarked for ‘ shelter relief ’ – DT American Red Cross has built a grand total of six houses , according to a JJ report . An investigation by Propublica and NPR has shown a pattern of highly inefficient spending , management troubles , and a lack of local expertise which has resulted in very little concrete relief to DT NNS of Haiti , despite massive outpouring of donations to CD of DT NNP ’ most prominent charities . CD major barrier to effective relief has been a reliance on foreigners who came to DT country with little or no knowledge of local culture or language , while dismissing or disparaging Haitians , DT report finds . Though DT American Red Cross ( ARC ) says IN 90 % of DT employees in DT Haiti program are Haitians , PRP MD not provide a breakdown of nationalities in top positions , and DT Propublica investigation found very few made PRP to top slots . “ DT implication IN talented , smart , competent Haitians cannot be found in Haiti has to be dispelled , if PRP are VBG to give Haitians a chance to be part of rebuilding Haiti , ” read a 2011 memo from Judith St. Fort , then - director of DT Haiti program , WDT described DT disparaging attitudes of senior ARC managers towards Haitian employees . Those foreign workers were RB more costly — potentially up to $ 100,000 more a NN — than Haitian employees . Despite Red Cross CEO Gail McGovern ’s own promise to “ share DT way PRP are spending our dollars , ” DT ARC has so far not even disclosed what percentage of its revenues VBP to overhead . DT percentage is considered by charity watchdogs to be an essential measure of a charity ’s trustworthiness and commitment to its cause rather than to its executives ’ paychecks . Even outside of big picture numbers IN overhead DT ARC “ has declined repeated requests to disclose DT specific projects , to explain how much money went to each or to say what DT results of each project were , ” Propublica reports . DT lack of transparency makes evaluating DT Red Cross ’ grand claims difficult , but some were clearly exaggerated or spun . For example , DT Red Cross says PRP has provided homes to more than 130,000 NNS , but DT included NNS who were just “ trained in proper construction techniques , ” NNS who ended up in temporary shelters , or NNS who got rental assistance for a short period . Only six permanent homes have been entirely completed by DT Red Cross in Haiti . Red Cross officials IN McGovern have repeatedly claimed IN “ Millions of Haitians are safer , healthier , more resilient , and better prepared ” and IN DT ARC has helped “ more than 4.5 million ” Haitians . But Jean - Max Bellerive , DT Prime Minister of Haiti when DT quake struck , finds those claims dubious when applied to a country with only 10 million NNS in total . “ No , no , ” Bellerive told Propublica , reacting to DT Red Cross ’ numbers . “ PRP ’s not possible . ” ‘ This Is Depressing ’ Though DT Red Cross blames DT poor result of DT housing project on difficulties navigating Haiti ’s land laws , others say PRP all came down to a lack of expertise in DT region , and a wasteful reliance on subcontractors , with each layer taking another bite out of donations for administrative costs . CD former head of DT Haiti shelter program for DT ARC , Lee Malany , told Propublica IN officials in Washington just did n’t seem to VB how to spend DT money PRP ’d raised . “ When I walked out of DT meeting I looked at DT NNS WDT I was working with and VBD , ‘ PRP VBP this is very disconcerting , this is depressing , ' ” VBD Malany , who later resigned . “ I VBD EX ’s no reason for me to stay here . I got on DT plane and left . ” 91 Cents on DT Dollar ? Not Quite According to charity watchdogs , an average charity MD spend 75 % of its funds on its cause , and VBG by DT measure , DT Red Cross ’ claims to efficient funding look great . “ Minus DT 9 cents overhead , 91 cents on DT dollar will be VBG to Haiti . And I give PRP my word and my commitment , I ’m banking my integrity , my own personal sense of integrity on DT statement , ” McGovern told CBS NN a few months after DT quake . Unfortunately , JJ other subcontracted groups MD then take their own chunk out of DT 91 cents per dollar for administrative overhead . In CD example , when DT ARC sent DT International Federation of DT Red Cross $ 6 million for a particular project , DT IRFC then took an additional 26 % of DT in overhead . In another $ 5.4 million project for housing improvement , Propublica found IN DT figure WDT went directly to DT work was closer to 60 cents on DT dollar . Even factoring in DT various sub-layers of administrative costs , Bellerive VBD he still did n’t understand where all DT money went . “ Five hundred million dollars in Haiti is a lot of money , ” he VBD . “ I ’m not a big mathematician , but I can make some additions . I VBP more or less DT cost of things . Unless PRP do n’t pay for DT gasoline DT same price I was paying , unless PRP pay NNS 20 times what I was paying them , unless DT cost of DT house PRP built was five times DT cost I was paying , PRP does n’t add up for me . ” Sputnik ‘ Where ’s DT $ 500 mn ? ’ Red Cross promises houses for 130,000 Haitians , ’ builds only 6 ’ When a devastating earthquake struck DT Western hemisphere ’s poorest country in 2010 , DT American Red Cross was CD of DT organizations at DT forefront of DT humanitarian effort to rebuild PRP a NN later , launching a multi-million - dollar effort . DT main program – LAMIKA ( a Creole acronym for ‘ A Better Life in My Neighborhood ’ ) – was to build hundreds of permanent homes to house some 130,000 NNS living in abject poverty after DT quake . Now , in 2015 , DT Port - au - Prince neighborhood of Campeche is as dilapidated as ever , with hardly any JJ buildings , trash strewn around , animals walking DT streets , and NNS enduring sub - standard conditions in self - made shacks . “ JJ residents live in shacks made of rusty sheet metal , without access to drinkable NN , electricity or basic sanitation . When PRP rains , their homes flood and residents bail out mud and NN , ” an introduction to a report says . An investigation by NPR and ProPublica gained access to “ confidential memos , emails from worried top officers , and accounts of a dozen frustrated and disappointed insiders ” familiar with how DT NGO broke its promises , misspent millions of dollars , and then issued self - congratulatory progress statements . DT ensuing report reveals very different results to DT ones outlined in CEO Gail McGovern ’s project plan for Haiti , which promised “ brand JJ communities ” WDT MD make “ donors proud ” and “ help DT NNS in Haiti . ” She claimed her experience had made her more “ flexible during emergencies . ” DT investigation pointed to a series of systematic blunders and untruths surrounding DT Haiti effort , however . DT Red Cross ’s internal proposal put DT number of houses to be built at 700 by January 2013 . In reality , only six houses were actually constructed . “ PRP asked DT Red Cross to show PRP around its projects in Haiti so PRP MD see DT results of its work . PRP declined , ” DT report reads . Part of DT reason behind DT failure is IN DT Red Cross “ did n’t have DT NN - how ” and “ PRP had no development experience , ” former employees VBD . In some NNS , DT NGO MD give millions to other groups . Poor supervision and lack of proper oversight allowed these subcontractors to rack up inordinate bills for management and overhead costs . Another issue WDT MD have hindered DT Red Cross ’s work in Haiti is trouble with DT country ’s “ dysfunctional ” land title system . Other groups , which DT report does not name , had similar problems but , according to DT data , “ ultimately built 9,000 homes compared to DT Red Cross ’s six . ” Another possible reason for DT dismal results , pointed out by current and former employees , was “ an overreliance ” on expats who MD not speak French or Creole . DT Red Cross ’s statement , however , VBD IN over 90 percent of NNS hired were Haitians . DT did n’t seem to be reflected in DT top positions , however , according to DT authors of DT report . According to DT report , DT NGO displayed an arrogant attitude to national staff – some of DT very few NNS who MD speak French and DT local Creole . In some NNS , DT Red Cross actively discouraged their participation . This led to poor communication with DT local population and , ultimately , to DT failure of DT outreach project . “ VBG to meetings with DT community when PRP do n’t speak DT language is not productive , ” CD Haitian who worked on DT project in Campeche VBD , adding IN meetings MD be skipped altogether at times . Some $ 140,000 was spent on housing , food , and R&R for a foreign project manager , who RB enjoyed four paid leaves a NN . DT comes to more than $ 100,000 more than MD have been spent on a local equivalent . “ A lot of money was spent on those NNS who were not Haitian , who had nothing to do with Haiti . DT money was just VBG back to DT NNP NNPS , ” CD Haitian who coordinated expat housing for DT Red Cross confessed . At DT same NN , Red Cross officials focused more on programs which MD generate good publicity than those providing DT most homes , according to testimony from Lee Malany , DT project manager of DT shelter program . He recalled a Washington meeting where top officials had no idea what to do with DT millions PRP ’d been given for housing projects . DT organization MD not provide details on how PRP spent DT almost $ 500 million WDT PRP received , nor give specific details of how its projects were carried out . However , various promotional statements estimated IN DT initiative had repaired some 4,000 homes , erected temporary shelters for thousands of families , and donated $ 44 million for food aid and hospital construction . “ DT Red Cross ’s JJ reports offer only broad categories about where $ 488 million in donations has gone , ” according to DT authors of DT report . Five NNS since DT quake , a report by McGovern says : “ Millions of Haitians are safer , healthier , more resilient , and better prepared for future disasters thanks to generous donations to DT American Red Cross . ” DT organization claimed IN PRP had helped 4.5 million Haitians , but according to reporters “ EX is reason to doubt ” DT . Asked if EX was any truth to DT Red Cross ’s claims , Haiti ’s Prime Minister did n’t seem to VB how DT numbers MD add up : “ No , no … PRP ’s not possible , ” Jean - Max Bellerive VBD , stressing IN DT country ’s entire population is only about 10 million . “ What DT Red Cross told PRP is IN PRP are coming here to VB Campeche . Totally VBP PRP , ” DT report cites Jean Flaubert , DT head of a community group set up by DT Red Cross , as saying . “ Now I do not understand DT NN WDT PRP are talking about . I VBP DT Red Cross is working for themselves . ” DT Red Cross had already been embroiled in several scandals following 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina relief efforts , but DT did not matter to DT JJ NNS , organizations and NNP celebrities who continued to support PRP . DT Haiti earthquake was touted as “ a spectacular fundraising opportunity ” within DT organization , according to CD former official involved with DT program . A great number of high - profile NNS and organizations donated to DT cause , including Michelle Obama , JJ Hollywood A-listers , and DT NFL . PRP later turned out IN DT organization continued to collect funds for emergency relief projects even after PRP had hit its targets . DT extra money was found to have been put toward eradicating DT American Red Cross ’s own debt , which exceeded $ 100 million . RT DT Red Cross has been caught stealing $ 400 million of relief money WDT should have gone to DT NNS who suffered from Superstorm Sandy . But this is nothing JJ . When Haiti was hit with DT giant earthquake in 2011 , DT Red Cross received hundreds of millions of dollars from NNS around DT NN . However , only about 5 % of DT money every got to DT survivors , who , by DT way , are still living in tent cities in mud , squalor and horrible sanitation conditions right across DT road from DT Red Cross headquarters in Haiti . But what this article does n’t say is IN DT Vatican owns DT Red Cross , and PRP have been in DT money grabbing - stealing business for DT past 1,700 NNS . DT Vatican is DT richest organization in DT NN . Read history and do your own research if PRP do n’t believe me . Red Cross and Vatican helped thousands of Nazis to escape Research shows how travel documents ended up in hands of DT likes of Adolf Eichmann , Josef Mengele and Klaus Barbie in DT postwar chaos DT Red Cross and DT Vatican both helped thousands of Nazi war criminals and collaborators to escape after DT second NN war , according to a book WDT pulls together evidence from unpublished documents . DT Red Cross has previously acknowledged IN its efforts to help refugees were used by Nazis because administrators were overwhelmed , but DT research suggests DT numbers were much higher than thought . Gerald Steinacher , a research fellow at Harvard University , was given access to thousands of internal documents in DT archives of DT International Committee of DT Red Cross ( ICRC ) . DT documents include Red Cross travel documents issued mistakenly to Nazis in DT postwar chaos . PRP throw light on how and why mass murderers such as Adolf Eichmann , Josef Mengele and Klaus Barbie and thousands of others evaded capture by DT allies . By comparing lists of wanted war criminals to travel documents , Steinacher says Britain and Canada alone inadvertently took in around 8,000 former Waffen - SS members in 1947 , JJ on DT basis of valid documents issued mistakenly . DT documents – which are discussed in Steinacher ’s book Nazis on DT Run : How Hitler ’s henchmen fled justice – offer a significant insight into Vatican thinking , particularly , because its own archives beyond 1939 are still closed . DT Vatican has consistently refused to comment . Steinacher believes DT Vatican ’s help was based on a hoped - for revival of European Christianity and dread of DT Soviet Union . But through DT Vatican Refugee Commission , war criminals were knowingly provided with false identities . DT Red Cross , overwhelmed by millions of refugees , relied substantially on Vatican references and DT often cursory Allied military checks in issuing travel papers , known as 10.100s . PRP believed PRP was primarily helping innocent refugees although correspondence between Red Cross delegations in Genoa , Rome and Geneva shows PRP was aware Nazis were getting through . “ Although DT ICRC has publicly apologised , its action went well beyond helping a few NNS , ” VBD Steinacher . Steinacher says DT documents indicate IN DT Red Cross , mostly in Rome or Genoa , issued at least 120,000 of DT 10.100s , and IN 90 % of ex-Nazis fled via Italy , mostly to Spain , and North and South America – notably Argentina . Former SS members often mixed with genuine refugees and presented themselves as stateless ethnic Germans to gain transit papers . Jews trying to VB to Palestine via Italy were sometimes smuggled over DT border with escaping Nazis . Steinacher says IN individual Red Cross delegations issued war criminals with 10.100s “ out of sympathy for individuals … political attitude , or simply because PRP were overburdened ” . Stolen documents were RB used to whisk Nazis to safety . He VBD : “ PRP were really in a dilemma . PRP was difficult . PRP wanted to VB rid of DT job . Nobody wanted to do PRP . ” DT Red Cross refused to comment directly on Steinacher ’s findings but DT organisation says on its website : “ DT ICRC has previously deplored DT fact IN Eichmann and other Nazi criminals misused its travel documents to cover their tracks . ” DT Guardian CD of DT significant sources of funds for DT fascist Nazionist Jesuit Khazarian Mafia is DT healthcare industry which registered a whopping $ 3.09 trillion in 2014 , and is projected to soar to $ 3.57 trillion in 2017 , in DT NNP alone . PRP can help take down DT Dark Cabal by avoiding drugs , defeat any viral attack and scaremongering easily by knowing how to build our own comprehensive antiviral system .

[ Note : Some words and / or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words / phrases having no exact counterpart . ] According to this report , on 25 January 1959 , nine young hikers from DT Ural Polytechnic Institute sent out on an expedition from DT city of Yekaterinburg ( in 1959 named Sverdlovsk ) in DT Sverdlovsk Oblast to DT Otorten Mountain range , but when PRP failed to reach their destination , on 11 February , local search parties were sent out to discover their whereabouts . Dylatov Pass Incident expedition members preparing to leave on their death journey on 25 January 1959 By 20 February 1959 , this report continues , these nine young hikers were still missing and a Federal criminal investigation was begun as well as a JJ search conducted by Federal police forces and Russian military aircraft . On 25 February 1959 , this report grimly notes , DT first discoveries were made as to DT fate of these nine young hikers — and IN over DT next two months showed PRP had all been savagely killed by an “ unknown beast ” WDT had , literally , torn apart their bodies . JJ examination of DT bodies revealed strange anomalies , this report explains , with all of DT victems having odd injuries WDT forensic NN - doctors at DT NN MD not explain — such as 23 - NN - old victim Ludmila Alexandrovna Dubinina who was found with her head tilted backward , mouth wide open as if screaming , her tongue ripped out by DT root , and her eyes forcibly removed from their sockets . In 1962 , this report notes , DT Committee for NNP Security ( former Soviet Union KGB ) closed their investigation into these hikers death by stating PRP was “ unable to be solved ” — but which this past January ( 2016 ) DT Investigative Committee ( SLEDCOM ) ordered back to “ active / immediate investigation status ” . As to why SLEDCOM ordered this case reopened , this report explains , began with a report of a JJ body discovered in DT Dyatlov Pass Incident region on 9 January , and though finding no cause for alarm , certain DNA forensic evidence from DT original investigation into DT 1959 deaths of DT 9 young hikers raised JJ questions WDT in DT 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s NN MD not have answered . And as to DT JJ DNA evidence obtained from DT 1959 victems of DT Dyatlov Pass Incident WDT “ alarmed / alerted ” SLEDCOM investigators , this report continues , was PRP being an “ exact comparison ” to DT only known Bigfoot creature to have ever been captured — and who was named Zana . Zana , this report explains , was captured in DT region of ( present day Abkhazia ) in 1850 and described to be an “ ape woman ” and “ Neanderthal ” having immense power and whose height was 6 feet 6 inches . Covered in thick hair , and able to outrun a horse , this report notes , Zana was eventually “ tamed / domesticated ” , and until her death , in 1890 , had a number of NNS by a number of different men — some of whom died due to her “ habit / custom ” of washing her newborn babies in cold running river NN , even in DT winter NN . Though “ what / who ” exactly Zana actually was had never been determined in her lifetime , this report says , but an astounding discovery was made about her in 2015 by Professor Bryan Sykes of DT University of Oxford who in examining DT genetics of her ancestors found “ her DNA to be unparalleled ” making her “ half human , half ape ” — and as ancient legends have long described DT Bigfoot creature as being . With Zana having been confirmed as being a Bigfoot creature by DNA evidence , and DT same DNA evidence being discovered on DT mutilated bodies of DT victems of DT 1959 Dyatlov Pass Incident , and DT 2015 video evidence of another of these creatures being sighted in DT same Caucasus Mountain region where Zana was first captured , this report VBZ IN neither SLEDCOM or DT FSB have DT “ power / authority ” under existing Federation laws to disregard DT facts of this admittedly strange case making a Bigfoot creature a murder suspect . And as to how seriously DT FSB is in investigating this suspected Bigfoot murder case is contained in this report explaining how Russian police officials worked with DT Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) in analyzing DT 2015 Russian Bigfoot video and 2016 Michigan Bigfoot video utilizing DT same military computer identification systems WDT biometrically identifies Islamic terrorists in DT Levant War Zone from both aircraft and satellite video photography systems . This report concludes without its stating how this strange murder investigation will continue , but with this being DT first NN a Bigfoot creature has been named as a suspect in a human crime , PRP wonders what PRP can do .

EX 's DT credibility problem to start with . I 'm best - known for dressing up in silly costumes and playing practical jokes on NNS on TV . What if I actually came across CD of these beasts and announced DT fact to DT NN ? I do n't VB I MD make DT most believable of witnesses . Nevertheless , I did spend a lot of DT past NN doing just this . I was Dom Joly , Monster Hunter , and I printed off a business card to prove PRP . First I had to decide on my destinations . Some were obvious : DT Himalayas , for DT Yeti , a hairy beast who wanders their upper slopes , harassing mountain climbers and Tintin . And Loch Ness , for our very own Nessie , who lures tourists into much purchasing of tat . As I 'm married to a Canadian I had heard of DT country 's own monster – Ogopogo , a Nessie - type creature WDT lives in Lake Okanagan in British Columbia . DT lake is bordered by vineyards and peach orchards and was a most pleasant place in which to VB monster - hunting . I discovered another couple online . Explorers have written for several centuries about mokele m'bembe ( blocker of rivers ) a dinosaur - type creature VBN to live in Lake Tele , in DT north of DT Congo . This was by far DT most difficult of my trips , with days in a canoe and trekking through forest before meeting a particularly tricky tribe whose permission I needed to VB to DT lake . Things went pear - shaped as everyone got drunk on "" jungle gin "" and spears and machetes suddenly made a very unwelcome appearance . DT second was in Japan . I 'd read about DT hibagon WDT roamed DT hills around Hiroshima and was reputed to be a man who had been irradiated by DT atomic bomb . This seemed unlikely but my dad , who was in DT Fleet Air Arm , flew over Hiroshima DT day after DT bomb had been dropped , and I had always been fascinated by DT place . Then of course , EX was Bigfoot , rumoured to roam DT coast from California to British Columbia , with hundreds of sightings a NN . Bigfoot was DT main reason I got interested in monsters in DT first place . I can still remember DT excitement of seeing DT Patterson - Gimlin footage for DT first NN . This was a shaky 16 mm film taken in a place called Bluff Creek , northern California , in 1967 . DT footage shows a large ape - JJ creature , walking on two legs in a jerky manner and staring back at DT cameraman . Some hail this as conclusive proof ; others claim PRP is a fake . EX is a Bigfoot museum ( bigfootcountry.net ) in Willow Creek , Humboldt County – "" Ground Zero "" for Bigfoot hunters – and DT was where I decided to head . I love northern California : as soon as PRP drive over DT Golden Gate Bridge and up Highway CD , PRP are in a very special place . First PRP hit Hitchcock country : Bodega Bay is where he filmed DT Birds , and EX were some particularly large and scary looking seagulls hovering above my car . Then I headed inland , through various areas of intoxication . First DT wineries of Napa and Sonoma , then DT Microbrewery Belt , and finally Weed Country . PRP MD be a coincidence IN Bigfoot territory is slap - bang in DT middle of this last area … Moss - covered coastal oaks give way to huge forests of redwood trees . If PRP 've never seen a redwood , PRP 's difficult to describe their power . I 'm not normally awed by nature , but DT redwood brings out my inner hippy . I have a huge urge to hug them , except PRP MD take about 20 of me . On a lovely stretch called Avenue of DT Giants ( avenueofthegiants.net ) I drove through some of DT most impressive of these woody behemoths , wishing I 'd rented a convertible so I MD really appreciate my insignificance . I stopped to try to photograph some of DT trees ( PRP 's almost impossible ) and got into an altercation with a pick - up truck full of lady rednecks . PRP ended up IN a scene from Deliverance ( not DT scene ) . Suffice to say I hot - footed PRP out of RB and ended up in DT wonderfully named city of Eureka , which boasts a couple of extraordinary mock - Gothic Victorian buildings , including DT Carson Mansion , WDT are VBN to have inspired some of DT weirder parts of Disneyland . From RB PRP was just an hour to Willow Creek – a CD - street town much frequented in summer by fishermen and white - NN rafters , drawn by DT beautiful Trinity River . I stayed for a couple of nights , checking out DT Bigfoot Museum and talking to Twin - Peaks - esque locals before heading off into DT great unknown . PRP 's only when PRP do this WDT PRP realise just how possible PRP might be for something IN Bigfoot to remain largely undiscovered . DT vegetation is thick and impenetrable and covers a vast area . I found this out to my cost when I crashed my car in snow 18 miles up an empty road . With no mobile signal I had no option but to walk out ( breaking DT Ray Mears rule of always staying by your vehicle ) . PRP was very cold , and EX are mountain lions , bears , paranoid , armed weed farmers and Bigfoot roaming DT area … In a movie this MD have been where I blacked out and woke up in Bigfoot 's nest with DT creature breastfeeding me . Fortunately a lovely man called Peter , who was out mushroom picking , saved me at DT seven - mile mark . Peter 's parents run Marble Ranch ( marblemountainranch.com ) , a "" dude ranch "" – DT sort of place where cissy east coasters can come to learn to ride , shoot and survive in DT wilderness ( à la City Slickers ) . As Peter drove me off DT mountain I MD n't help thinking IN this was exactly DT sort of trip I needed to take before my next adventure . DT night , safe in a log cabin straight out of Elle Décor , I ate a steak DT size of Texas and slept DT sleep of kings . After all my trips I 'm still not sure whether monsters exist . I did catch something on film in DT Okanagan . I 'm sure PRP 's possible for things to exist without discovery in places IN DT Congo and DT Himalayas , and EX are just too JJ NNS who 've seen something in Bigfoot territory for EX to be nothing at all . Maybe PRP should VB find out yourself . Just print a business card saying PRP 're a monster hunter and head off into DT unknown . • Scary Monsters and Super Creeps : In Search of DT NNP 's Most Hideous Beasts by Dom Joly ( Simon & Schuster , £ 12.99 ) is out now .

Just IN DT U.S. NN , DT Russian NN is very interested in maintaining social order , and so PRP MD probably delay telling DT NN about a potential asteroid impact for as long as possible . In life , what NNS do is far more important than what PRP say , and DT JJ center WDT DT Russians have just created will not just be watching giant space rocks . According to Futurism , this JJ organization will be in charge of making sure “ PRP do n’t collide with NNP ” … Russian space agency Roscosmos is creating a center devoted to monitoring meteors , comets , and asteroids to ensure PRP do n’t collide with NNP — even PRP means having to blow them up in space . “ As part of DT creation of a monitoring system and information support for DT safety of space activities in near - NNP space , PRP plan to launch DT Russian Center for Small Celestial Bodies , whose main task will be to detect and track celestial bodies approaching NNP , ” Igor Bakaras , a senior official at Roscosmos subsidiary TsNIIMash , told Russian - owned NN agency Sputnik . Certainly nobody can fault DT Russians for allocating resources toward this purpose . Our solar system is full of potentially dangerous giant space rocks , and a big enough impact MD literally end our civilization . But why now ? According to a British NN source , this JJ organization will be evaluating whether PRP is better “ to destroy celestial objects or steer them on to JJ trajectories and away from NNP ” … Roscosmos , DT Russian equivalent of Nasa , wants to work out if PRP ’s possible to destroy celestial objects or steer them on to JJ trajectories and away from NNP . This MD involve slamming a ‘ kinetic impactor ’ craft in DT rock or using a satellite to drag PRP onto a JJ course . Nukes MD RB be sent into space to blow up DT rocks . A JJ department at Roscosmos called DT Russian Centre for Celestial Bodies will be tasked with looking into space to find comets and asteroids approaching NNP . Once again , nobody can argue with DT value of such a major project , but is n’t NASA already doing all this ? MD n’t DT Russians just sit back and let PRP Americans do all DT work ? I wish someone MD ask Vladimir Putin DT question . And this sudden move by DT Russians comes just CD NN after DT U.S. issued a “ National Near - NN Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan ” … In 2018 , DT White House Office of NNP and Technology Policy released a JJ report titled DT “ National Near - NNP Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan ” . DT 18 - page document outlines DT steps WDT NASA and DT Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) will take over DT next 10 NNS to both prevent dangerous asteroids from striking NNP and prepare DT country for DT potential consequences of such an event . Maybe U.S. officials suddenly decided last NN IN having a plan for incoming giant space rocks was a great idea , and maybe DT Russians decided IN PRP was such a great idea IN PRP should copy PRP . Or maybe both governments VBP something WDT PRP are n’t telling PRP yet . Of course DT truth is IN NASA has not even identified most of DT giant space rocks WDT are floating around out RB . For example , back in July a very large asteroid came very close to hitting PRP … A 427 - foot - wide asteroid whizzed within 45,000 miles of NNP on Thursday . While DT MD sound far away , 45,000 miles is what astronomers consider a close shave : PRP ’s less than 20 % of DT distance between NNP and DT moon . This was DT closest PRP ’ve come to an “ Armageddon ” - JJ scenario in at least a few NNS . If DT asteroid had actually hit our NN , PRP MD have been DT worst disaster WDT any of PRP have ever seen by a very wide margin . And according to leaked emails , officials at NASA only knew about PRP DT day before PRP whizzed by PRP … Travelling at 55,000 mph and measuring 426 feet by 187ft ( 130 m x 57 m ) , NASA only realised 2019 OK was coming 24 hours before PRP passed . Experts say IN had PRP hit , PRP MD have devastated an entire city IN London with over 30 times DT NN of DT atomic blast at Hiroshima . So DT truth is IN PRP MD be hit by a giant space rock at any NN , and none of PRP MD have any idea IN PRP is even coming . With DT being VBN , EX are a couple of enormous asteroids WDT NNS do VB about DT MD potentially be major problems over DT next decade . DT first NN WDT I VBP to discuss is 2007 FT3 . DT is not a fancy name , and not IN much is known about DT asteroid , but apparently EX is a chance IN PRP “ might hit DT NN on Oct. 2 , 2024 ” … In DT case of 2007 FT3 , Sentry reported IN DT asteroid MD hit NNP between DT NNS 2024 and 2116 . During these NNS , Sentry recorded a total of 164 potential NNP impacts caused by DT asteroid . As noted by DT monitoring system , EX ’s a chance IN 2007 FT3 might hit DT NN on Oct. 2 , 2024 . By DT way , Rosh Hashanah begins on DT evening of October 2nd , 2024 . I do n’t VB if DT is important , but I thought I MD throw DT out RB . According to NASA , this asteroid MD hit at a speed of approximately 46,000 miles per hour , and PRP MD “ create a crater WDT ’s several miles long ” … Based on DT data collected by Sentry , DT asteroid has an estimated diameter of about 1,115 feet , which makes PRP almost as tall as DT Empire NNP Building . DT monitoring system noted IN PRP MD breach NNP ’s atmosphere and hit DT NN at a velocity of around 46,000 miles per hour . Given DT asteroid ’s speed and size , PRP is certainly capable of causing high levels of destruction if PRP ends up colliding with NNP . Upon impact , PRP MD create a crater WDT ’s several miles long . DT NN WDT will be released from DT asteroid ’s explosion MD be powerful enough to level an entire city as well as its neighboring areas . 2007 FT3 is not getting much publicity at all , but a slightly larger asteroid WDT MD potentially hit PRP in 2029 is getting far more attention . On April 13th , 2029 , PRP is being projected IN Apophis will pass by our NN at a distance WDT is “ ten times closer than DT moon ” . DT following comes from Wikipedia … DT closest known approach of Apophis comes on April 13 , 2029 , when DT asteroid comes to within a distance of around 31,000 kilometres from NNP ’s surface . DT distance , a hair ’s breadth in astronomical terms , is ten times closer than DT moon , and even closer than some man-made satellites . [ 23 ] PRP will be DT closest asteroid of its size in recorded history . On DT date , PRP will become as bright as magnitude 3.1 [ 22 ] ( visible to DT naked eye from rural as well as darker suburban areas , visible with binoculars from most locations ) . [ 24 ] DT close approach will be visible from Europe , Africa , and western Asia . During DT approach , NNP will perturb Apophis from an Aten - class orbit with a semi-major axis of 0.92 AU to an Apollo - class orbit with a semi-major axis of 1.1 AU . NASA insists IN PRP will not actually hit PRP , but other independent researchers are skeptical . And if Apophis does n’t hit PRP then , NASA has listed ten other future dates when PRP potentially MD … Over in Russia , PRP are so concerned about this asteroid WDT PRP have “ developed intercontinental ballistic missiles WDT aim to destroy asteroid Apophis ” … In what sounds IN an elevator pitch for an Armageddon sequel , Russian NNS announced IN PRP ’ve developed intercontinental ballistic missiles WDT aim to destroy asteroid Apophis , which is VBG to swing by NNP in 2036 . RB referred to as 99942 Apophis , PRP measures 210 - 330 meters ( 690 - 1080 feet ) in diameter . According to a Slate article by astronomer Phil Plait an encounter with NNP MD mean not so fun times for our NN ; “ PRP MD release DT NN equivalent to more than 1 billion tons of TNT exploding , at least 20 times more than DT largest nuke ever detonated ! ” Russian NNS have RB warned IN Apophis MD have “ hundreds of opportunities to hit DT NNP over DT course of DT next century ” . But for now , both American and Russian NNS are assuring PRP IN everything is just fine and IN EX is no reason to panic . Do PRP believe them ? Maybe PRP are telling PRP DT truth . Maybe EX is nothing to be concerned about at all . But of course both governments have a long track record of being loose with DT truth , and PRP MD n’t be much of a surprise at all if PRP were n’t exactly being straight with PRP .

Although Jon and Sabrina Carey purchased DT 10 - acre property near Butte Falls two and a half NNS ago , DT pond has been in place for 40 NNS — but DT fact does n’t matter to DT Jackson County Watermaster ’s Office . “ I basically bought a lemon , ” VBD Jon , who became teary - eyed at DT edge of DT partially NN - covered body of NN being targeted by NN , in an interview with DT Mail Tribune . “ DT ’s how PRP explained PRP to me . ” But DT couple desperately wants to keep DT stunning longstanding feature in tact , so , as DT Mail Tribune reports , DT Careys have “ pleaded with DT Medford NNP Commission to adopt DT pond and treat PRP as a municipal NN source , something Jackson County Watermaster Larry Menteer has opposed because of DT precedent PRP MD set . “ DT NNP Commission has rights to DT watershed around DT Careys ’ property , where dozens , if not hundreds , of ponds are located , as well as Medford ’s primary source of NN , Big Butte Springs . ” And DT Careys are n’t DT only NNS in DT watershed who ’ve had difficulties with , well , ‘ DT NN ’s ’ NN . Eagle Point resident Gary Harrington spent 90 days in jail for illegally harboring some 13 million gallons of illicit rainwater — WDT ’s enough rain to fill around 20 Olympic - sized swimming pools . Harrington masterfully crafted several ponds on his property — even building docks for CD , and stocking PRP with largemouth bass — but his insistence DT NN MD assist in fire control and prevention did n’t satisfy DT NN , since a “ 1925 NN law dictates IN DT NN belongs to DT Medford NNP Commission . ” “ DT bigger story here is IN rainwater collection is indeed kosher in Oregon , provided IN PRP ’re capturing PRP from an artificial , impervious surface such as a rooftop with DT assistance of rainwater barrels . “ But an extensive reservoir set - up complete with 10 - and 20 - foot - tall dams is verboten without DT proper , NN - issued NN - right permits — after all , Oregon law dictates IN NN is a publicly owned resource — and Harrington did not possess VBN permits . ” Harrington and DT Oregon NNP Resources Department waged an extended battle over DT ponds , and at CD point , PRP was ruled he MD be allowed to keep everything in place — but DT decision was backtracked in less than CD NN . Ultimately , “ Rain Man , ” as he came to be called , found himself charged with nine misdemeanors , spent three months behind bars , and had to shell out $ 1,500 in fines — and was ordered to destroy DT dams and drain all DT ponds . Harrington ’s case might have been infinitely more complex than DT Careys ’ — considering DT large volume of NN and infrastructure he ’d put in place — but PRP share DT same theme of overbearing NN and arguably wholly unnecessary law versus DT right of NNS to do as PRP please with their property . “ When PRP ’re honest , PRP take everything away from PRP , ” VBD Sabrina Carey , who inspected country records — which plainly showed DT pond — before PRP purchased DT property . VBG by DT book might have been DT ‘ fatal ’ error for DT couple , however , since DT county did n’t take issue with DT pond until Jon sought to grow legal JJ cannabis on DT land and had to prove EX was a viable source of NN for DT grow operation . According to DT Watermaster ’s Office , DT previous owners had not received a permit for DT pond , so DT Careys were now in violation of Oregon regulations — and PRP MD have to shoulder DT cost of draining DT NN . In an effort to prove DT pond is legitimate and persuade county NN to allow PRP to remain on DT property , DT couple stopped using PRP — even though DT well on their land had run dry — and began shipping in DT NN for daily living and gardening from nearly Butte Falls . PRP ’ve RB had no choice but to hire attorney Sarah Liljefelt , who filed a request with Jackson County to provide a permit for them to store NN , stating : “ DT reservoir on Ms. Carey ’s property , though small , is CD of DT largest in DT area . ” As DT Mail Tribune notes , “ Liljefelt VBD DT pond is an important source of NN for beavers , otters , elk , deer , bear , mountain lion , bobcat , bald eagle osprey , great blue heron , snowy egret , Canada geese and DT western pond turtle . ” By all appearances , DT large pool of NN does more good for DT environment than if PRP were n’t RB at all — during their fight with DT NNP , DT Careys even suggested PRP be used for fire control and prevention , IN Harrington did , as DT pond is easily accessible by fire crews . But DT county has displayed only nonsensical obstinance on DT issue . “ This pond seems to be doing way more JJ good than not being here . Why , now , is PRP so important to be removed ? ” Jon lamented . Indeed , DT 40 - NN - old man does n’t even profit from DT JJ cannabis grown on DT land he and his wife own , as he literally gives DT crop — free of charge — to friends . “ I do n’t make anything out of this , ” he VBD . Members of DT NNP Commission disagree on whether this is an issue worth fighting over at all , but as DT Mail Tribune reports , “ NNP Commission staff found several problems with DT Careys ’ request , including setting a precedent WDT MD prompt similar requests and weaken NN statutes while not meeting DT definition of ‘ municipal NN source . ’ “ DT staff found PRP MD be very difficult to access DT NN stored in DT pond for municipal reasons , and further monitoring and following up on compliance issues MD be difficult and costly for DT commission . ” However , DT commission RB failed to VB why this should be a matter for DT NN in DT first place — why punitive bureaucracy needs to meddle with a pond on private property , serving as a valuable ecosystem , DT poses no threat to anyone or anything , and is n’t even an eyesore , must be destroyed . Besides a trailer home and dilapidated house , DT pond is DT only thing of value on their acreage , and , obviously , as Sabrina VBD , “ PRP did n’t buy PRP for DT double - wide . ” She told DT Mail Tribune DT pond should have been registered with DT Oregon NNP Resources Department nine NNS ago , but DT owners at DT NN did not reside on DT property and did n’t do so . PRP have even offered to reduce DT pond ’s size , allow officials to inspect PRP when necessary , and have provided a draft easement to DT commission in hopes of allowing DT prized NN feature to remain intact — thus far to no avail . “ PRP ’re just trying to do PRP by DT rules , ” Sabrina explained . “ I ’m trying to cooperate . ” In 2012 , Gary Harrington had already been through NNS of conflict with NN officials over illicit NN — and provided CNSNews with stronger sentiment on DT topic : “ When something is wrong , PRP just , as an American citizen , PRP have to put your foot down and say , ‘ This is wrong ; PRP just ca n’t take away anymore of my rights and from here on in , I ’m VBG to fight PRP . ” DT NN feels entitled to not only something located on private property , but IN NNS should not be allowed to collect rain , is everything wrong with excessive NN — and DT overregulation of daily life ."

Since then , researchers have identified thousands of teeth and a few partial jawbones from DT creature . With these pieces in hand , PRP ’ve tried to fit DT bigfoot - JJ ape into DT primate family tree . Without any usable DNA , however , DT task has been difficult . Now , using proteins in dental enamel , researchers report PRP 've finally found how DT Gigantopithecus fits into DT great ape puzzle , according to a JJ NN published in DT journal Nature . According to a press release , DNA has been key in helping NNS map out DT messy relationships between primates and hominids WDT lived within DT past 50,000 NNS . But in fossils older than DT , DNA is very difficult to extract and NNS have only done PRP successfully in a few rare NNS , including in CD 400,000 - NN - old hominin specimen . Gigantopithecus remains are estimated to be between 300,000 to 2 million NNS old , placing its reign at some point during DT Pleistocene epoch . No Gigantopithecus DNA has ever been recovered . DT ’s why an international team of researchers used techniques from an emerging field called proteomics to VB molecular information from DT Gigantopithecus molar in DT JJ NN . In traditional DNA sequencing , pieces of DT DNA molecule are put through a process WDT copies its sequence of nucleotides and puts them back together into a full genome . DT quality and completeness of DT genome , however , depends on how well - preserved DT original sample of DNA is . Most DNA degrades much more quickly , especially in hot , humid climates . But in proteomics , researchers more or less reverse - engineer DNA by looking at DT proteins preserved in teeth , which last much longer . Because each protein is made up of amino acids , and because each amino acid is encoded by a three - letter DNA sequence , researchers can produce snippets of ancient DNA by analyzing DT proteins . Last September , DT technique was used to properly place a 1.7 - million - NN - old species of wooly rhinoceros in its family tree , proving IN DT method MD be used to understand ancient animals . Researchers applied DT protein - mining technique to a 1.9 million - NN - old molar from Gigantopithecus found in a Chuifeng cave in NNP . Gretchen Vogel at NNP reports DT team dissolved tiny amounts of enamel from DT tooth and then analyzed PRP using mass spectrometry . PRP were able to identify 500 peptides , or short chains of amino acids , from six different proteins . Bruce Bower at NNP NNP reports IN five of those proteins still occur in extant ape and monkey species . DT team compared DT accumulated differences in DT proteins to those animals , finding IN DT massive Gigantopithecus is a distant relative of modern orangutans . DT two lineages likely diverged from a common ancestor over 10 million NNS ago . “ Until now , all WDT was known about this species was based on DT morphology of DT JJ teeth and DT few mandibles found , typical of a herbivore , "" NN author Enrico Cappellini , an evolutionary geneticist at DT University of Copenhagen , says in DT press release . “ Now , DT analysis of ancient proteins , or palaeoproteomics , has allowed PRP to reconstruct DT evolutionary history of this distant relative . ” DT success of this technique has big implications for DT future of paleoanthropology . Because JJ of DT fossilized remains of ancient hominins come from tropical and subtropical areas , IN East Africa , southern Africa and Indonesia , EX ’s little chance IN viable DNA has survived . But DT protein trick changes everything . “ Until now , PRP has only been possible to retrieve genetic information from up to 10,000 - NN - old fossils in warm , humid areas , ” Welker tells Katie Hunt at CNN . “ This is interesting , because ancient remains of DT supposed ancestors of our species , Homo sapiens , are RB mainly found in subtropical areas , particularly for DT early part of human evolution . This means IN PRP can potentially retrieve similar information on DT evolutionary line leading to humans . ” DT team RB says IN PRP MD be able to look at more than just molars .

Ricketts and Carroll thought PRP were gardeners when PRP grew tomatoes , beets , scallions , spinach , kale and multiple varieties of Asian cabbage . But according to a village ordinance WDT restricts edible plants to backyards only , PRP were actually criminals . “ DT ’s what NN does – interferes in NNS ’s lives , ” Ricketts VBD . “ PRP had DT garden for 17 NNS . PRP ate fresh meals every day from DT garden . Since DT village stepped its big foot in PRP , PRP have ruined our garden and my NN . ” These sorts of stories pop up several times a NN . PRP are often discussed at free - market oriented and libertarian sites to illustrate just DT myriad of ways WDT DT NN interferes in our daily lives . JJ times , PRP intervene to prohibit totally innocuous activities IN growing a front - yard garden . What articles IN these often fail to point out of course , is IN these laws did n’t appear out of nowhere . PRP are often passed because some voters demanded DT city council or DT county commission pass laws prohibiting front - yard gardens , or backyard chicken coops , or other non-violent activities deemed by some to be a nuisance to DT neighborhood . These laws then persist over NN because DT majority of voters either agree with DT laws , or do n’t feel strongly enough about DT matter to demand a NN . In Miami Shores , DT law against front - yard gardens was likely passed because at least a few NNS felt IN front yard gardens were not so innocuous after all . This situation illustrates , yet again , a problem with majoritarian NN . If a majority of DT citizens of Miami Shores — or whatever jurisdiction — hate front - yard gardens , then PRP likely to vote for candidates who will vote to ban them . DT minority , of course , is simply out of luck . DT implied solution in JJ of these free - market publications is IN NN should just VB out of DT business of regulating front yards . OK . But then NNS will begin to ask DT inevitable questions : • Should NNS be able to just dump garbage in their front yards then ? • Can PRP park a food truck RB 24 - hours a day and sell hamburgers out of them ? • Can PRP put in their front yards a 20 - foot sculpture of a jackalope ? If DT response is “ of course not ” then DT next question is “ why not ? ” or “ so what is prohibited in front yards ? ” If a pile of old appliances is not acceptable in DT front yard , why is a vegetable garden acceptable ? What if JJ NNS VBP gardens are nearly as unsightly as an old car on blocks ? PRP can probably figure out where this leads . PRP ’re right back at regulating what NNS can do in their front yards . Indeed , when Ricketts laments IN “ NN interferes in NNS ’s lives ” in response to DT ban on her garden , PRP wonders if she ’d be equally libertarian if her neighbors had piles of junk cars in their front yards . So , is EX no solution here ? Must PRP choose between bans on gardens on DT CD side , and piles of garbage on DT other ? DT solution , of course , lies in decentralization and privatization . DT Role of DT Homeowners Association Were local governments to totally abandon all regulations on neighborhood aesthetics , PRP ’s easy to imagine what MD happen next . Assuming , of course , IN PRP were unable to convince local governments to ban allegedly “ unsightly ” features IN front - yard gardens , those who hate DT veggie gardens MD then seek a solution in private homeowners associations . Those who VBP to be surrounded by neighbors who only plant nicely manicured lawns can have PRP — provided PRP find others willing to enter into a private agreement banning front - yard gardens . And this is exactly what JJ NNS do when PRP choose to move to covenant - controlled communities where PRP believe their “ property values ” will be protected by private agreements banning unsightly features to front yards or houses . NNS VBP to complain about their homeowners associations , of course , but EX ’s a reason PRP are n’t VBG away . DT homeowner agreements do n’t actually deter a large number of NNS from purchasing homes in those communities . Thus , DT developers who sell houses RB have little reason to believe consumers VBP a more laissez - faire neighborhood . JJ residents actually VBP knowing IN DT local association wo n’t tolerate a weed - filled front yard or an old car up on blocks in DT driveway . This is why DT homeowners association became widespread in DT first place : Some homeowners association are more strict than others , but most are far more strict than DT local municipal governments . Indeed , those who VBP front - yard gardens will probably find PRP easier to find a municipal NN WDT tolerates them , than a private homeowners association . Finding a homeowners association WDT allows chicken coops is probably even harder . JJ municipal governments , on DT other hand , allow them . Imagine , for instance , IN Ricketts convinced a group of NNS on her side of town to form a secessionist neighborhood WDT was able to separate from DT city of Miami Shores . PRP became West Miami Shores . DT Ricketts and their neighbors MD then VB to have their front - yard gardens . This MD RB be good for DT residents in Old Miami Shores . When potential JJ residents come looking around to buy a house in Old Miami Shores , DT anti-garden NNS can simply say “ PRP VBP a front - yard garden ? Do n’t move here , move over RB . ” Yes , PRP ’s true IN some residents in both areas will then have to move if PRP VBP to live in a neighborhood WDT favors their particular views on front - yard gardens . But at least now both groups have DT option of getting what PRP VBP . In DT absence of either of these options , PRP ’re only left with a situation in which DT majority can run untrammeled over a minority , and DT minority has no escape .

Bunions can have a negative effect on your day to day life , making PRP hard to walk and wear shoes which are tight to your feet . A bunion is a bony lump WDT forms on DT inside of your foot at DT big toe joint . This can affect your big toe by pushing PRP to point excessively towards your second toe . • None Hardened skin on DT bottom of your foot Not sure if PRP ’s a bunion ? Here is other foot related symptoms : • Gout – redness , heat , swelling and pain WDT comes and goes • Arthritis – aching , swollen and stiff ; usually worse in DT morning • Broken toe – pain , bruising and swelling after hurting your toe Wear wide , flat shoes with a soft sole . Flat shoes help to take pressure away from your big toe and create more space to help relieve your bunion pain . Bunion pads ( soft pads WDT VBP over your bunion ) or shoe insoles help to ease painful bunion pressure . Apply an NN pack wrapped in a tea towel to DT affected area when PRP can . This will help to ease DT pain and help to reduce DT swelling . Take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help reduce DT pain and DT inflammation . Try losing weight if PRP are overweight . Being overweight can put a lot of pressure on your feet , which can lead to creating bunions . Wear a bunion splint at night to help gradually push DT toe back into its normal alignment . This will not VB rid of your bunion but rather help with DT positioning of your toe . If DT pain in your bunion does not VB away , DT only way to VB rid of them is through bunion surgery . Bunion surgery is called an osteotomy , which usually takes less than an hour and is usually done under general anaesthetic . DT surgery is undertaken by making a small cut in DT skin over your big toe , cutting or scraping away DT bunion and then returning DT toe bone to its correct position using metal screws or staples put under your skin . These will often be left in DT toe permanently . Unfortunately , bunions can sometimes naturally come back even after surgery . • None Make sure your home is crutch friendly before PRP leave for your operation , moving any furniture to create more space to move around in . RB , make sure everything PRP need is within reach . • None Arrange for someone to take PRP home after DT surgery and help PRP out DT first few days . • None Stock up on easy to make meals IN tin.ned or frozen food . • None Before your operation your doctor MD ask PRP not to eat or drink to avoid any complications while PRP ’re under general anaesthetic . • None If PRP are a smoker , try to stop before DT surgery as smoking can put PRP at risk of getting a wound infection and slow down your recovery rate . PRP will usually be given crutches after your surgery and PRP MD be wearing a splint , plaster cast or special shoe . To help with your recovery : • None Try to avoid being on your feet for too long for at least 2 weeks • None Do not drive for at least 6 to 8 weeks • None Avoid sports for up to 6 months Once PRP have recovered PRP MD see some differences in your big toe , PRP might be weaker or stiffer than before , PRP MD not be perfectly straight and EX ’s a chance PRP MD have to keep wearing wide , comfy shoes . From DT surgery PRP MD still feel sore and PRP MD have swelling in your foot which can take up to six months to a NN to reduce . If PRP are suffering from bunion pain , fill in our enquiry form on DT right to find out more about getting bunion surgery at CD of our treatment centres ."

No matter where PRP look , DT Deep NNP is struggling to preserve its privileged position across DT entire societal spectrum . Whether in DT realm of economics , geopolitics , military , or even in DT realm of exopolitics , PRP are losing control , big NN . In short , PRP is experiencing sheer panic . As scheduled , DT Shanghai International NNP Exchange ( INE ) started entertaining investors for its listed crude oil futures for a total of 23 overseas brokerage . In just a week , PRP already has a total of 278,234 transactions , worth 115.92 billion yuan . NNP is currently DT top NN user , and PRP is only fitting IN PRP must dictate where PRP wants to VB as far as DT currency to use in its oil purchases from here on . This , of course , spells doom for DT warmongering Petrodollar industry . No , this is just a shift between two elements of DT same NN order . DT is absolutely wrong . In NNP today , EX ’s an ongoing construction of 33 highly advanced nuclear power plants , and its intermediate end goal is to export turnkey power plants around DT NN , at a price WDT only NNP MD offer . Even Donald NNP is forcing NNP to drink its more expensive hydrocarbons , hence DT tariffs on Chinese steel . But DT NNP has only shot itself in DT foot , as DT latter is much cheaper IN DT local counterparts . Why is DT ? NNP is not playing on DT same scarcity - based JJ game of DT West . PRP wants to show DT other side IN EX ’s a better way to run DT NN for everyone ’s benefit . PRP is wise enough to understand IN DT only way PRP can protect itself is to empower other nations on DT NN by way of large scale development and DT massive establishments of free NN systems via DT peaceful use of nuclear power . DT British Empire is not happy with DT latest defeat of its terror group in Ghouta Syria . About 6,000 CIA employed militants got a safe passage again towards Idlib . But CD journalist took PRP upon himself to confront some of them and question DT wisdom of their senseless actions . DT militants were offered reconciliation by DT Syrian NN , but PRP refused PRP and chose instead to relocate themselves to Idlib , where PRP can be unified with DT other defeated CIA stooges . Highly volatile NNP , on DT other hand , is hinting IN DT NNP is leaving Syria soon . Clap , clap , clap for NNP . But really , DT damage done in Syria can not be undone with just CD statement . Not to mention DT fact IN he just signed DT highest Pentagon budget eve in his entire history , a few weeks ago . DT latest anti-Trump British coup attempt using Cambridge Analytica psyop is not working either . Childish Behaviour from An Old Empire Back in DT UK , DT immaturity in NN affairs is manifested in DT wanton use of its intelligence department to initiate poorly executed anti-Russian false flag , i.e. poisoning its own Russian asset , Sergei Skripal , and blame PRP on Russia . This was followed by DT massive EU and NNP expulsion of Russian diplomats , which is in some ways a huge improvement considering IN more than a NN back , PRP were actually assassinating them , openly and otherwise . As of late , DT Russians have responded with their own proportionate diplomatic expulsion of Western diplomats , due in large part to DT latter ’s failure to show evidence relevant to DT Skripal poisoning case , and DT UK ’s refusal to cooperate in its investigation . DT British Empire ’s desperation continues with DT unannounced and unwarranted raid of CD Aeroflot commercial airliner , and with DT shutting down of Julian Assange ’s internet access . DT Swedish NN has no criminal case against DT Wikileaks founder , Julian Assange , and therefore , DT Empire has nothing to pin down DT activist with . What crime is RB when all WDT Julian Assange is doing is just what mainstream journalists worth their salt MD have done , i.e. unearth and publish NN wrongdoings ? DT Deep NNP controlled governments around DT NN VBP to curtail our freedom of expression and intrude into our private lives , but DT same cannot afford to open themselves up for JJ scrutiny . Multipolarity is Gaining Ground ; Leaving DT West Behind PRP have made DT offer , but DT other side is refusing your terms of mutual benefit . What are your options ? As DT chips fall where PRP should be , DT revival of DT ancient Silk Road continues unabated as more African nations are availing themselves of DT massive infrastructure projects facilitated and 70 % financed by NNP . This major JJ lift is coupled with technology transfer WDT will a profound impact on DT lives of DT local population . Compare DT to DT shallow rock concerts for Africa , where DT proceeds went only to DT pockets of those who run DT shady and bogus humanitarian NGOs . All WDT DT Western critics MD do is to watch these developments , and malign NNP IN PRP is only after DT exploitation of DT recipient ’s natural resources , IN DT West is doing for last 500 NNS . No , NNP ’s participation in DT construction of basic infrastructures in Africa is to make DT entire continent truly independent from Western exploitation instead . DT is a far cry from DT Western regime NN , war , and biochemical attacks against DT Africans . DT NNP NNPS of America needs to remember RB IN in its infancy as a republic , PRP was NNP which financed its early JJ development , with DT same railroad constructions across DT continent , using hardworking Chinese labor WDT in DT American history books were labeled as slaves . PRP is so good to watch DT in Africa right now , PRP are already talking about how to intercourse with NNP through JJ terms , … rather than using their knowledge in mathematics counting dead bodies by Western injected wars . Remember how DT Deep NNP controlled UN responded to DT Rwanda genocide in 1994 . Who triggered DT event if not DT Western intelligence assets in DT region ? As PRP stands today , DT East is tired of dealing with DT immaturity and exceptionalism of DT West , and PRP is forging ahead with globalwide development , with or without , Western participation . DT West is not in a position anymore to dictate DT terms by which mankind ascends towards shared prosperity . DT privileged position of DT Parasitic Western Elite will become irrelevant soon , as their hosts gain more knowledge on how to decontaminate , detoxify and deconstruct DT imaginary prison cells built around them . EX ’s never been a theoretical and physical limits to what DT human being can do . DT established , dogmatic limitations in NNP are exactly where DT Western hegemony derives its own power . But DT combined scientific achievements of DT RIC Alliance between Russia , Iran and NNP , have effectively neutralized DT . All of DT above is DT real cause of DT panic within DT Deep NNP Empire . PRP can actually participate in DT JJ efforts to cripple DT Deep NNP organized criminal cabal 's ability for genocide , while enjoying healthcare freedom at DT same NN , by boycotting Big Pharma for good ."

Why do so JJ journalists seem to simply accept press releases as fact ? Are qualifications no longer relevant when PRP comes to journalistic scrutiny of NN ? Perhaps EX ’s no longer any scrutiny ? Let ’s be clear : EX is NO Yeti ! DT NNS claiming EX is such a creature have no idea about NN or DT evidence WDT MD be needed to convince NNS IN a Yeti , or Bigfoot , or Yowie , or what ever PRP call PRP , exists ! This week I learned from Sydney ’s Daily Telegraph , DT ABC , DT UK ’s Mail and Telegraph newspapers and DT Huffington Post ( no less ) IN a Russian scientist is to be supported in his Bigfoot - hunting efforts by an international team specialising in human evolution . I checked my calendar to see if PRP was April 1 , and not October 6 , as I had ( mistakenly ) thought . No , October . This story must be real . Not again , I thought . DT 82 - NN - old Russian heading DT project , Igor Burstev – apparently “ Dr ” Burstev – has convinced himself , local authorities , and apparently plenty of journalists , IN DT Yeti is real . Burstev even claims DT Yeti is a relic population of Neandertals . And a number of sometimes quite respectable NN outlets have been sucked in with this nonsense . Who are these “ international NNS ” who are VBG to find DT Yeti ? PRP have been given no names , nor credentials , nor institutions PRP belong to . I suspect , UH so JJ of DT so - called NN - VBP deniers , PRP are frauds . Is EX a chance DT Yeti might exist ? Yes , EX ’s a chance , just as with so JJ phenomena PRP NNS VBP about . PRP ’s possible . From NN to NN , a JJ species of mammal , even primate , is described in some remote area largely unexplored by NNS . But based on DT evidence presented in favour of its existence , DT Yeti looks IN a very poor hoax to me . Why are EX no proper photographs of this creature ? Oh , of course – DT NNS who have seen PRP were too scared to look away and pick up their cameras in case DT Yeti disappeared from view . All of DT claimed photographs or video footage I have seen are completely bogus . I MD do a better job myself with a gorilla costume from a party shop , a good camera , and photo - editing software . Why do PRP always have ridiculously large footprints WDT look IN some off - course camel train passed through snow - swept Siberia ? A few facts : DT Neandertals , our closet evolutionary relative , with whom PRP shared an ancestor 400 - 500,000 NNS ago , went extinct 25 - 30,000 NNS ago . PRP had a body mass of around 75 kilograms ( on average ) and stood about 162 centimetres tall ( on average ) . PRP can estimate these things with good accuracy from their bones . I ’m about 75 kilograms , but a lot taller than 162 centimetres . Yet my foot is size eight , about average for an Australian male . Why DT big foot ? Lack of imagination by DT hoaxers , I suppose . Or lack of knowledge of human anatomy and DT human fossil record , more likely . Oh , and guys , PRP had five toes IN PRP do , not four , as seems mostly to be DT case in your fake photos . Try referring to a good anatomy textbook for starters . When our ancestors left Africa , 60 - 70,000 NNS ago , PRP happily interbred with DT Neandertals . In fact , all of PRP alive today whose ancestry is Asian , Aboriginal Australian , European , Pacific Islander or Native American , share DNA with them . Up to 6 % of our DNA is in fact DT result of our ancestors having shagged them ! Far from being bushy - haired , large - toothed , stoop - shouldered , and rather large - footed IN DT Yeti , Neandertals looked an awful lot IN PRP . Probably not very hairy ; certainly with small canine teeth ; and hell , PRP even had nice posture – not IN some creature WDT has spent his working life hunched over a computer writing about hare - brained nonsense IN DT existence of mythical beings living today in Siberia … So I ask , where ’s DT evidence for living Neandertals ? If anyone has PRP , PRP ’d really love to see PRP . Forget those broken bits of fossil bones and teeth PRP anthropologists have to work with to VB our evolution . PRP MD do real biology ! With living creatures ! No - CD should be excused from DT normal rigorous processes such as peer review NNS have to VB through to VB their research accepted . Anyway , forget DT hassles of convincing DT real experts , VB straight to DT NN – PRP ’ll believe PRP !"

On DT other hand , PRP see those who RB use information technology to re-inforce stereotypes , stigmatization and demonization against certain race , faith , or sexual orientation . “ DT being VBN , our next goal should be winning DT battle of ideas , ” he stressed , citing DT use of hate speech against migrants and minority communities blaming them for a nation 's problems . Today 's symposium was DT first of a series on Tracking Hatred IN UNAOC will be hosting to identify best practices by engaging JJ NN and journalists , especially those who well positioned to investigate xenophobia , violent extremism and prejudice . DT next symposium will be held in Baku , Azerbaijan , in April ."

For 16 NNS , Jesse and his brother , Frank , committed robberies and murders throughout DT Midwest . Detective magazines and pulp novels glamorized DT James gang , turning them into mythical Robin Hoods who were driven to crime by unethical landowners and bankers . In reality , Jesse James was a ruthless killer who stole only for himself . DT teenage James brothers joined up with southern guerrilla leaders when DT Civil War broke out . Both participated in massacres of settlers and troops affiliated with DT North . After DT war was over , DT quiet farming life of DT James brothers ’ youth no longer seemed enticing , and DT two turned to crime . Jesse ’s first bank robbery occurred on February 13 , 1866 , in Liberty , Missouri . Over DT next couple of NNS , DT James brothers became DT suspects in several bank robberies throughout western Missouri . However , locals were sympathetic to ex-southern guerrillas and vouched for DT brothers . Throughout DT late 1860s and early 1870s , DT James gang robbed only a couple banks a NN , otherwise keeping a low profile . In 1873 , DT James gang got into DT train robbery game . During CD such robbery , DT gang declined to take any money or valuables from southerners . DT train robberies brought out DT Pinkerton Detective Agency , employed to bring DT James gang to justice . However , DT Pinkerton operatives ’ botched attempt to kill James left a woman and her child injured and elicited JJ sympathy for Jesse and Frank James . DT James gang suffered a setback in 1876 when PRP raided DT town of Northfield , Minnesota . DT Younger brothers , cousins of DT James brothers , were shot and wounded during DT brazen midday robbery . After running off in a different direction from Jesse and Frank , DT Younger brothers were captured by a large posse and later sentenced to life in prison . Jesse and Frank , DT only members of DT gang to escape successfully , headed to Tennessee to hide out . After spending a few quiet NNS farming , Jesse organized a JJ gang . Charlie and Robert Ford were on DT fringe of DT JJ gang , but PRP disliked Jesse intensely and decided to kill him for DT reward money . On April 3 , while Jesse ’s mother made breakfast , DT JJ gang met to hear Jesse ’s plan for DT next robbery . When Jesse turned his back to adjust a picture on DT wall , Bob Ford shot him several times in DT back . His tombstone reads , “ Jesse W. James , Died April 3 , 1882 , Aged 34 NNS , 6 months , 28 days , Murdered by a traitor and a coward whose name is not worthy to appear here . ” READ MORE : 7 Things PRP MD Not VB About Jesse James"

"" — Proverb 21:4 JARS OF CLAY names Jimmy Hendrix and DT Beatles as their inspiration ( Dann Denny , “ Christian Rock , ” Sunday Herald Times , Bloomington , Ind. , Feb. 8 , 1998 ) . DT lead guitarist for Jars of Clay is VBN to be a “ Beatles fanatic ” ( Christian NNP , Dec. 8 , 1997 ) . Please understand IN I do n't condemn anyone , for DT Bible condemns all of PRP as guilty , dirty , rotten , hell - deserving sinners . My salvation solely rests in Christ 's righteousness , because of DT precious blood WDT He gave for our sins . My intention is not to be unkind ; but rather , to expose DT falsehood of so - called "" Christian rock . "" When asked by ChristianityToday to list their musical influences , Jars of Clay members “ listed no Christian artists ” ( Christianity Today , Nov. 15 , 1999 ) . Jars of Clay performs Ozzy Osbourne ’s “ Crazy Train ” during their concerts . Osbourne is DT filthy - mouthed former lead singer for DT occultic rock group Black Sabbath . Ozzy Osbourne , has featured Pan on all of his recent album covers ( 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) . Sadly , Ozzy is bound for Hell . DT Rock ' N ' Roll industry is infamous for worshipping Pan , who is DT very embodiment of Rock music . Pan represents Satan , which is what DT ever - so - popular Satanic hand sign shows , allegiance to DT Devil . Though members of Black Sabbath today claim PRP was all done in innocence and “ fun , ” PRP promoted occultic themes through their music and concerts , including upside down crosses and altar calls for Satan . PRP blasphemed Jesus Christ and railed against DT authority of DT God of DT Bible . Osbourne has almost died several times because of his outrageous drug abuse and alcoholism . He has bitten DT head off of a live bat in concert . He has dressed in women ’s clothing and stripped off most of his clothes during concerts . He is deeply scarred by his savage lifestyle and maintains a semblance of normalcy today through DT drug Prozac . Ozzy Osbourne 's works are of DT Devil . Can PRP image ... a professed Christian group WDT sings Ozzy Osbourne 's hellish music ? Just as shocking and tragic is DT fact IN Christianity Today ( CT ) magazine promotes Jars of Clay . Why ? Do PRP VB to see some freaks ?... then look at DT website for Jars of Clay . Is this what Christianity has come to ? Why MD Christianity Today promote such worldly garbage ? To no surprise , Christianity Today promotes Harry Potter 's witchcraft . CT is RB pro-homosexual . This is Christianity . EX is NOTHING even remotely "" Christian "" about DT band JARS OF CLAY , and Christianity Today is apostate . Jars of Clay play DT Devil 's rock - n- roll , and Christianity Today sinfully promotes them . PRP should be renamed to ApostasyToday . Do PRP VB Jesus Christ is pleased with DT worldly , Heavy Metal rock - n- roll of Jars of Clay ? No way !!! DT Bible warns in 2nd Corinthians 6:14 - 17 ... "" Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers : for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness ? and what communion hath light with darkness ? And what concord hath Christ with Belial ? or what part hath he WDT believeth with an infidel ? And what agreement hath DT temple of God with idols ? for ye are DT temple of DT living God ; as God hath VBD , I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and PRP shall be my NNS . Wherefore come out from among them , and be ye separate , saith DT Lord ... "" PRP is sinful to hobnob with DT Devil 's crowd . PRP can't eat at DT Devil 's table without getting food poisoning ! PRP can't play with fire without getting burned . DON'T be deceived my friend , ALL rock music is straight out of DT pits of Hell . Again , I am not judging anyone ; but rather , DT apostate music itself . Shortly before Billy Graham had them perform in his crusades , JARS OF CLAY had "" recorded for an R - rated film loaded with ' live - in ' lovers , nudity , graphic violence , and 83 obscenities . [ 1 ] DT lead vocalist from this band VBD : "" PRP do n't VB to be called a ' Christian band ' because PRP is a turn - off . Jerry Huffman perceptively added : "" Do n't worry , PRP MD not accuse PRP of such . "" Certainly , JJ believers love DT NN 's music ; but PRP must never attempt to justify PRP . EX 's a big difference between a believer who struggles with Rock music , verses someone who tries to say IN EX 's nothing wrong with Rock music . 1st John 2:17 tells PRP IN this NN will CD day pass away and everything in PRP ( 2nd Peter 3:10 ) . DT members of STRYPER love secular rock music . In a 1995 interview , Michael Sweet , who was DT lead singer for Stryper , VBD : “ I ’m a fan of all DT stuff from DT ‘ 80s . Groups IN Bon Jovi , Van Halen , and Aerosmith . Musically , I VBP a lot of DT stuff , but back when I was a kid what I grew up listening to ranged from Elvis Presley , Jerry Lee Lewis , Fats Domino all DT way to groups IN Three Dog Night . Credence [ Clearwater Revival ] was CD of my favorite bands and a group called Bad Company . I just loved them and Elvis , of course ” ( CCM Magazine , November 1995 ) . EX 's not a dime 's difference between DT NN 's rock music , and so - called Christian rock ( and Christian rockers admit PRP ! ) . Some of DC TALK’S musical role models are DT Beatles , David Bowie , and DT Police , all of which are wicked secular rock groups . dc Talk ’s album “ Free at Last ” contains a song titled “ Jesus Is Just Alright , ” which was first sung by DT Byrds ( DT song was later covered by DT Doobie Brothers ; a “ doobie ” is a marijuana joint ) . DC Talk ’s Kevin Smith admits IN he listens to mostly secular rock music ( Flint Michigan Journal , March 15 , 1996 , B19 ) . dc Talk opened its “ Jesus Freak ” concerts with DT Beatles ’ song “ Help . ” PRP RB perform Jimi Hendrix ’s Purple Haze . Hendrix was a drug- crazed NNP Age occultist . Toward DT end of their concerts dc Talk plays DT rock song “ All Apologies ” by DT wicked secular rock group Nirvana , formerly led by Kurt Cobain . Terry Watkins notes : “ Kurt Cobain is CD of DT worst Antichrist , blasphemers since John Lennon . Kurt Cobain decorated his home with blood - splattered baby dolls hanging by their necks ! DT inside of Nirvana ’s album In Utero , which is DT album dc Talk got ‘ All Apologies ’ from , has pictures of chopped up babies ! Cobain ran around his neighborhood spray - painting , ‘ ABORT CHRIST ’ and ‘ GOD IS GAY . ’ Cobain ’s first band was called ‘ Fecal Matter . ’ Cobain killed himself a couple of NNS ago ” ( Dr. Watkins , Christian Rock : Blessing or Blasphemy ? ) Jars of Clay has a less commercial sound WDT appeals to "" alternative rock "" fans drawn to groups IN R.E.M. or Matchbox Twenty . DT band has enjoyed some crossover success in DT secular market . So much for being a so - called “ Christian ” group ! Their first album went double platinum with astonishing sales of over 2 million copies ( making PRP CD of DT best - selling albums of 1996 ) . DT band ’s third disc was chosen by Playboy as Album of DT Month . This is just sickening ! These phonies call themselves “ Christians ” and yet sing DT Devil 's music , open concerts for Satanist Ozzy Osbourne , and are praised by DT smutty PLAYBOY magazine . Jars of Clay are of DT Devil . Birds of a feather flock together . AMY GRANT says , “ I love to hear Billy Joel , Kenny Loggins and DT Doobie Brothers ” ( NNP , March 11 , 1985 ) . Amy ’s album House of Love includes DT environmental - mother - NN song , “ Big Yellow Taxi , ” by JJ - age - priestess Joni Mitchell ( Ibid . ) . Mitchell is infamous for her open relationship with a spirit she calls “ Art . ” Obviously she is communing with demons , and PRP is unconscionable for Amy Grant to be promoting Mitchell ’s music to Christian young NNS . I 'm not judging Amy Grant , for I VBP Billy Joel 's music too ; but I 'm not VBG to dare say IN EX 's nothing wrong with PRP . God deliver our young NNS from these materialistic , worldly , deceitful , wicked imposters who EXPLOIT DT name of Jesus to make a buck and corrupt America 's youth . DT NN has no place in DT NNP Testament Church . This means IN Relient K , Toby Mac , Avalon , Jeremy Camp , Dead Poetic , Demon Hunter , Newsboys , Whitecross , MxPx , Third Day , Passion , Delirious , Bride , DT Almost , Disciple , Kutless , Inhale / Exhale , PFR , Emery , Robert Pierre , Chris Tomlin , Marsha Stevens , Further Seems Forever , Switchfoot , Soul P. , NNP Life Worship , DC talk , Echoing Angels , Matt Redman , Katinas , Michael W. Smith , Lincoln Brewster , GRITS , Geoff Moore DT Distance , Thousand Foot Krutch , Steven Curtis Chapman , Mercy Me , and Jars of Clay ... HAVE NO BUSINESS BRINGING THEIR WORKS OF DARKNESS INTO ANY JJ TESTAMENT CHURCH ! To be a friend of DT NN is to be DT enemy of God ( James 4:4 ) . "" Love not DT NN , neither DT things WDT are in DT NN . If any man love DT NN , DT love of DT Father is not in him . For all DT is in DT NN , DT lust of DT flesh , and DT lust of DT eyes , and DT pride of life , is not of DT Father , but is of DT NN . And DT NN passeth away , and DT lust thereof : but he WDT doeth DT will of God abideth for ever . "" — 1st John 2:15 - 17"

He had picked this moment to render his very first representational drawing , and our hopes rose . But her jaw was locked in an icy and inscrutable smile . Later , at a crowded open house for prospective families , a hedge - fund manager from a former Soviet republic told me about a good JJ school in DT area WDT accepted a high percentage of NNS with disabilities . As insurance against private school , he was planning to grab a spot at this JJ school by gaming DT special - needs system — which , he added , was n’t hard to do . Wanting to distance myself from this scheme , I waved my hand at DT roomful of parents desperate to cough up $ 30,000 for preschool and VBD , “ PRP ’s all a scam . ” I meant DT whole business of basing admissions on interviews with 2 - NN - olds . DT hedge - fund manager pointed out IN if he reported my words to DT admissions officer , he ’d have CD less competitor to worry about . When DT rejection letter arrived , I took PRP hard as a comment on our son , until my wife informed me IN DT woman with DT frozen smile had actually been interviewing PRP . PRP were DT ones who ’d been rejected . PRP consoled ourselves IN DT school was n’t right for our family , or PRP for PRP . PRP was a school for amoral finance NNS . At a second private school , my wife watched intently with other parents behind a CD - way mirror as our son engaged in group play with other toddlers , their lives secured or ruined by every share or shove . He was put on DT wait list . Places at DT preschool were awarded on a first - come , first - served basis . At DT front of DT line , parents were lying in sleeping bags . PRP had spent DT night outside . DT system WDT dominates our waking hours , commands our unthinking devotion , and drives PRP , IN orthodox followers of an exacting faith , to extraordinary , even absurd feats of exertion is not democracy , which often seems remote and fragile . PRP ’s meritocracy — DT system WDT claims to reward talent and effort with a top - notch education and a well - paid profession , its code of rigorous practice and generous blessings passed down from generation to generation . DT pressure of meritocracy made PRP apply to private schools when our son was 2 — not because PRP wanted him to attend private preschool , but because , in NNP York City , where PRP live , getting him into a good JJ kindergarten later on MD be even harder , and if PRP failed , by DT point most of DT private - school slots MD be filled . As friends who ’d started months earlier warned PRP , PRP were already behind DT curve by DT NN he drew his picture of DT moon . PRP were maximizing options — hedging , IN DT finance guy , IN JJ families PRP knew — already tracing DT long line WDT MD lead to DT horizon of our son ’s future . DT mood of meritocracy is anxiety — DT low - grade panic when PRP show up a few minutes late and all DT seats are taken . NNP York City , with its dense population , stratified social ladder , and general pushiness , holds a fun - house mirror up to meritocracy . Only NNP York MD force me to wake up early CD Saturday morning in February , put on my parka and wool hat , and walk half a mile in DT predawn darkness to register our son , then just 17 months old , for nursery school . I arrived to find myself , at best , DT 30th person in a line WDT led from DT locked front door of DT school up DT sidewalk . Registration was still two hours off , and places MD be awarded on a first - come , first - served basis . At DT front of DT line , parents were lying in sleeping bags . PRP had spent DT night outside . DT school ’s progressive pedagogy had fostered a wonderfully intimate sense of each child as a complex individual . But progressive politics meant thinking in groups . When our son was in third or fourth grade , students began to form groups WDT met to discuss issues based on identity — race , sexuality , disability . I understood DT solidarity WDT MD come from these meetings , but I RB worried IN PRP might entrench differences WDT DT school , by its very nature , did so much to reduce . Other , less diverse schools in NNP York , including elite private ones , had taken to dividing their students by race into consciousness - raising “ affinity groups . ” I knew several mixed - race families WDT transferred their kids out of CD such school because PRP were put off by DT relentless focus on race . Our son and his friends , whose classroom NN included slavery and civil rights , hardly ever discussed DT subject of race with CD another . DT school already lived what PRP taught . DT bathroom crisis hit our school DT same NN our son took DT standardized tests . A girl in second grade had switched to using male pronouns , adopted DT initial Q as a first name , and begun dressing in boys ’ clothes . Q RB used DT boys ’ bathroom , which led to problems with other boys . Q’s mother spoke to DT principal , who , with her staff , looked for an answer . PRP MD have met DT very real needs of students IN Q by creating a single - stall bathroom — DT NN in DT second - floor clinic MD have served DT purpose . Instead , DT school decided to VB rid of boys ’ and girls ’ bathrooms altogether . If , as DT city ’s Department of Education now instructed , schools had to allow students to use DT bathroom of their self - identified gender , then getting rid of DT labels MD clear away all DT confusion around DT bathroom question . A practical problem was solved in conformity with a JJ idea about identity . Within two NNS , almost every bathroom in DT school , from kindergarten through fifth grade , had become gender - neutral . Where signs had once VBN boys and girls , PRP now VBD students . Kids MD be conditioned to DT JJ norm at such a young age IN PRP MD become DT first cohort in history for whom gender had nothing to do with whether PRP sat or stood to pee . All IN biology entailed — curiosity , fear , shame , aggression , pubescence , DT thing between DT legs — was erased or wished away . DT school did n’t inform parents of this sudden end to an age - old custom , as if EX were nothing to discuss . Parents only heard about PRP when NNS started arriving home desperate to VB to DT bathroom after holding PRP in all day . Girls told their parents mortifying stories of having a boy kick open their stall door . Boys described being afraid to use DT urinals . Our son reported IN his classmates , without any collective decision , had simply gone back to DT old system , regardless of DT JJ signage : Boys were using DT former boys ’ rooms , girls DT former girls ’ rooms . This return to DT familiar was what politicians call a “ commonsense solution . ” PRP was RB kind of heartbreaking . As NNS , PRP did n’t VB to challenge DT JJ adult rules , DT JJ adult ideas of justice . Instead , PRP found a way around this difficulty WDT DT grown - ups had introduced into their lives . PRP was a quiet plea to be left alone . When parents found out about DT elimination of boys ’ and girls ’ bathrooms , PRP showed up en masse at a PTA meeting . DT parents in CD camp declared IN DT school had betrayed their trust , and a woman threatened to pull her daughter out of DT school . DT parents in DT other camp argued IN gender labels — and not just on DT bathroom doors —led to bullying and IN DT real problem was DT patriarchy . PRP called for DT elimination of urinals . PRP was a minor drama of a major cultural upheaval . DT principal , who seemed to care more about DT testing opt - out movement than DT bathroom issue , explained her financial constraints and urged DT formation of a parent - teacher committee to resolve DT matter . After six months of stalemate , DT Department of Education intervened : CD bathroom MD be gender - neutral . In politics , identity is an appeal to authority — DT moral authority of DT oppressed : I am what I am , which explains my view and makes PRP DT truth . DT politics of identity starts out with DT universal principles of equality , dignity , and freedom , but in practice PRP becomes an end in itself — often a dead end , a trap from which EX ’s no easy escape and maybe no desire for escape . Instead of equality , PRP sets up a JJ hierarchy WDT inverts DT old , discredited NN — a JJ moral caste system WDT ranks NNS by DT oppression of their group identity . PRP makes race , which is a dubious and sinister social construct , an essence WDT defines individuals regardless of agency or circumstance — as when Representative Ayanna Pressley VBD , “ PRP do n’t need any more brown faces WDT do n’t VB to be a brown voice ; PRP do n’t need black faces WDT do n’t VB to be a black voice . ” At times DT JJ progressivism , for all its up - to - DT - minuteness , carries a whiff of DT 17th century , with heresy hunts and denunciations of sin and displays of self - mortification . DT atmosphere of mental constriction in progressive milieus , DT self - censorship and fear of JJ shaming , DT intolerance of dissent — these are qualities of an illiberal politics . I asked myself if I was moving to DT wrong side of a great moral cause because its tone was too loud , because PRP shook loose what I did n’t VB to give up . PRP took me a long NN to see IN DT JJ progressivism did n’t just carry my own politics further than I liked . PRP was actually hostile to principles without which I do n’t believe democracy can survive . Liberals are always slow to realize IN EX can be friendly , idealistic NNS who have little use for liberal values . IN 2016 two obsessions claimed our family — Hamilton and DT presidential campaign . PRP listened and sang along to DT Hamilton soundtrack every NN PRP got in DT car , until DT kids had memorized most of its brilliant , crowded , irresistible libretto . Our son mastered Lafayette ’s highest - velocity rap , and in our living room he and his sister acted out DT climactic duel between Hamilton and Burr . DT musical did n’t just teach them this latest version of DT revolution and DT early republic . PRP filled their NN with DT imagined past , and while DT music was playing , history became more real than DT present . Our daughter , who was about to start kindergarten at our son ’s school , wholly identified with DT character of Hamilton — she fought his battles , made his arguments , and denounced his enemies . Every NN he died she wept . Hamilton and DT campaign had a curious relation in our lives . DT first acted as a disinfectant to DT second , cleansing its most noxious effects , belying its most ominous portents . Donald NNP MD sneer at Mexicans and rail against Muslims and kick dirt on everything decent and good , but DT American promise still breathed whenever DT Puerto Rican Hamilton and DT black Jefferson got into a rap battle over DT national bank . When our daughter saw pictures of DT actual Founding Fathers , she was shocked and a little disappointed IN PRP were white . DT only NN our kids had known was black . Their experience gave them no context for NNP ’s vicious brand of identity politics , which was inflaming DT other kinds . PRP wanted them to believe IN America was better than NNP , and Hamilton kept DT belief in DT air despite DT accumulating gravity of facts . Our son , who started fourth grade DT fall , had dark premonitions about DT election , but when DT Access Hollywood video surfaced in October , he sang Jefferson ’s gloating line about Hamilton ’s sex scandal : “ Never gonna be NN now ! ” DT morning after DT election , DT kids cried . PRP cried for NNS close to PRP , Muslims and immigrants who might be in danger , and perhaps PRP RB cried for DT lost illusion IN their parents MD make things right . Our son lay on DT couch and sobbed inconsolably until PRP made him VB to DT bus stop . DT next NN PRP were in DT car , PRP automatically put on Hamilton . When “ Dear Theodosia ” came on , and Burr and Hamilton sang to their newborn NNS , “ If PRP lay a strong enough foundation , PRP ’ll pass PRP on to PRP , PRP ’ll give DT NN to PRP , and PRP ’ll blow PRP all away , ” PRP was too much for me and my wife . PRP MD no longer feel DT romance of DT young republic . PRP was a long NN before PRP listened to Hamilton again . A few weeks after DT election , our daughter asked if NNP MD break our family apart . She must have gotten DT idea from overhearing a conversation about threats to undocumented immigrants . PRP told her IN PRP were lucky — PRP had rights as citizens WDT he MD n’t take away . I decided to sit down with DT kids and read DT Bill of Rights together . Not all of PRP made sense , but PRP got DT basic idea — DT NN was n’t King George III , DT Constitution was stronger than NNP , certain principles had not been abolished — and PRP seemed reassured . Since then PRP has become harder to retain faith in these truths . Our daughter VBD IN she hated being a child , because she felt helpless to do anything . DT day after DT inauguration , my wife took her to DT Women ’s March in Midtown Manhattan . She made a sign WDT VBD PRP have power too , and at DT march she sang DT CD protest song she knew , “ PRP Shall Overcome . ” For days afterward she marched around DT house shouting , “ Show me what democracy looks IN ! ” Our son was less given to joining a cause and shaking his fist . Being older , he RB understood DT difficulty of DT issues better , and PRP depressed him , because he knew IN NNS really MD do very little . He ’d been painfully aware of NN NN throughout elementary school — first grade was devoted to recycling and sustainability , and in third grade , during a unit on Africa , he learned IN every wild animal he loved was facing extinction . “ What are humans good for besides destroying DT NN ? ” he asked . Our daughter was n’t immune to DT heavy mood — she came home from school CD day and expressed a wish not to be white so IN she MD n’t have slavery on her conscience . PRP did not seem IN a moral victory for our NNS to grow up hating their species and themselves . PRP decided to cut down on DT political talk around them . PRP was n’t IN PRP wanted to hide DT truth or give false comfort — PRP MD n’t have let PRP even if PRP ’d tried . PRP just wanted them to have their childhood without bearing DT entire weight of DT NN , including DT JJ NN PRP had allowed into office . PRP owed our NNS a thousand apologies . DT future looked awful , and somehow PRP expected them to fix PRP . Did PRP really have to face this while PRP were still in elementary school ? I can imagine DT retort — DT rebuke to everything I ’ve written here : Your privilege has spared them . EX ’s no answer to DT — which is why PRP ’s a potent weapon — except to say IN identity alone should neither uphold nor invalidate an idea , or PRP ’ve lost DT Enlightenment to pure tribalism . Adults who draft young NNS into their cause might VB PRP ’re empowering them and shaping them into virtuous NNS ( a friend calls DT Instagram photos parents post of their woke kids “ selflessies ” ) . In reality DT adults are making themselves feel more righteous , indulging another form of narcissistic pride , expiating their guilt , and shifting DT load of their own anxious battles onto NNS who can’t carry DT burden , because PRP lack DT intellectual apparatus and political power . Our goal should n’t be to tell NNS what to VB . DT point is to teach them how to VB so PRP can grow up to find their own answers . I wished IN our son ’s school MD teach him civics . By age 10 he had studied DT civilizations of ancient NNP , Africa , DT early Dutch in NNP Amsterdam , and DT Mayans . He learned about DT genocide of Native Americans and slavery . But he was never taught about DT founding of DT republic . He did n’t learn IN conflicting values and practical compromises are DT lifeblood of self - NN . He was given no context for DT meaning of freedom of expression , no knowledge of DT democratic ideas WDT NNP was trashing or of DT instruments with which citizens MD hold those in power accountable . Our son knew about DT worst betrayals of democracy , including DT NN darkening his childhood , but he was n’t taught DT principles WDT had been betrayed . He got his civics from Hamilton . DT teaching of civics has dwindled since DT 1960s — a casualty of political polarization , as DT left and DT right each accuse DT other of using DT subject for indoctrination — and with PRP DT NN ’s basic knowledge about American NN . In DT past few NNS , civics has been making a comeback in certain NNS . As our son entered fifth grade , in DT first NN of DT NNP presidency , no subject MD have been more truly empowering . “ If PRP fail seventh grade PRP fail middle school , if PRP fail middle school PRP fail high school , if PRP fail high school PRP fail college , if PRP fail college PRP fail life . ” Every NN , instead of taking tests , students at DT school presented a “ museum ” of their subject of NN , a combination of writing and craftwork on a particular topic . Parents came in , wandered through DT classrooms , read , admired , and asked questions of students , who stood beside their projects . These days , called “ shares , ” were my very best experiences at DT school . Some of DT work was astoundingly good , all of PRP showed thought and effort , and DT coming - together of parents and kids felt IN DT realization of everything DT school aspired to be . DT fifth - grade share , our son ’s last , was different . DT NN ’s curriculum included DT Holocaust , Reconstruction , and Jim Crow . DT focus was on “ upstanders ” — individuals who had refused to be bystanders to evil and had raised their voices . PRP was an education in activism , and with no grounding in civics , activism just meant speaking out . At DT NN - end share , DT fifth graders presented dioramas on all DT hard issues of DT moment — sexual harassment , LGBTQ rights , gun violence . Our son made a plastic - bag factory whose smokestack spouted endangered animals . Compared with previous NNS , DT writing was minimal and DT students , when questioned , had little to say . PRP had n’t been encouraged to research their topics , make intellectual discoveries , answer potential counterarguments . DT dioramas consisted of cardboard , clay , and slogans . Students in NNP York City JJ schools have to apply to middle school . PRP rank schools in their district , six or eight or a dozen of them , in order of preference , and DT middle schools rank DT students based on academic work and behavior . Then a Nobel Prize–winning algorithm matches each student with a school , and DT ’s almost always where DT student has to VB . DT city ’s middle schools are notoriously weak ; in our district , just three had a reputation for being “ good . ” An education expert near PRP made a decent living by offering counseling sessions to panic - stricken families . DT whole process seemed designed to raise DT anxiety of 10 - NN - olds to DT breaking point . “ If PRP fail a math test PRP fail seventh grade , ” our daughter VBD CD night at dinner , looking NNS ahead . “ If PRP fail seventh grade PRP fail middle school , if PRP fail middle school PRP fail high school , if PRP fail high school PRP fail college , if PRP fail college PRP fail life . ” PRP were back to DT perversions of meritocracy . But DT country ’s politics had changed dramatically during our son ’s six NNS of elementary school . Instead of hope pendants around DT necks of teachers , in CD middle - school hallway a picture was posted of a card WDT VBD , “ Uh-oh ! Your privilege is showing . PRP ’ve received this card because your privilege just allowed PRP to make a comment IN others cannot agree or relate to . Check your privilege . ” DT card had boxes to be marked , IN a scorecard , next to “ White , ” “ Christian , ” “ Heterosexual , ” “ Able - bodied , ” “ Citizen . ” ( Our son struck DT school off his list . ) This language is now not uncommon in DT education NN . A teacher in Saratoga Springs , NNP York , found a “ privilege - reflection form ” online with an elaborate method of scoring , and administered PRP to high - school students , unaware IN DT worksheet was evidently created by a right - wing internet troll — PRP awarded Jews 25 points of privilege and docked Muslims 50 . DT middle - school scramble subjected 10 - and 11 - NN - olds to DT dictates of meritocracy and democracy at DT same NN : a furiously competitive contest and a heavy - handed ideology . DT two systems do n’t coexist so much as drive NNS simultaneously toward opposite extremes , realms WDT are equally inhospitable to DT delicate , complex organism of a child ’s mind . If EX ’s a relation between DT systems , I came to VB , PRP ’s this : Wokeness prettifies DT success race , making contestants feel better about DT heartless NN into which PRP ’re pushing their NNS . Constantly checking your privilege is CD way of not having to give PRP up . On DT day acceptance letters arrived at our school , some students wept . CD of them was Marcus , who had been matched with a middle school WDT he did n’t VB to attend . His mother went in to talk to an administrator about an appeal . DT administrator asked her why Marcus did n’t instead VB to DT middle school WDT shared a building with our school , WDT followed DT same progressive approach as ours , and DT was CD of DT worst - rated in DT NN . Marcus ’s mother left in fury and despair . She had no desire for him to VB to DT middle school upstairs . Our son got into CD of DT “ good ” middle schools . Last September he came home from DT first day of school and told PRP IN something was wrong . His classmates did n’t look IN DT kids in his elementary school . PRP found a pie chart WDT broke his JJ school down by race , and PRP left him stunned . Two - thirds of DT students were white or Asian ; barely a quarter were black or Latino . Competitive admissions had created a segregated school . His will be DT last such class . Two NNS ago , Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a JJ initiative to integrate NNP York City ’s schools . Our district , where EX are enough white families for integration to be meaningful , was chosen as a test case . Last NN a committee of teachers , parents , and activists in DT district announced a proposal : Remove DT meritocratic hurdle WDT stands in DT way of equality . DT proposal MD VB rid of competitive admissions for middle school — grades , tests , attendance , behavior — which largely accounted for DT racial makeup at our son ’s JJ school . In DT JJ system , students MD still rank their choices , but DT algorithm MD be adjusted to produce middle schools WDT reflect DT demography of our district , giving disadvantaged students a priority for 52 percent of DT seats . In this way , DT district ’s middle schools MD be racially and economically integrated . De Blasio ’s initiative was given DT slogan “ Equity and Excellence for All . ” PRP tried to satisfy democracy and meritocracy in a single phrase . I went back and forth and back again , and finally decided to support DT JJ plan . My view was gratuitous , since DT NN came a NN too late to affect our son . I MD have been sorely tested if chance had put him in DT first experimental class . Under DT JJ system , a girl at his former bus stop got matched with her 12th choice , and her parents decided to send her to a charter school . No doubt JJ other families will leave DT NN - school system . But I had seen our son flourish by VBG to an elementary school WDT looked IN DT city . I had RB seen meritocracy separate out and demoralize NNS based on their work in fourth grade . “ If PRP fail middle school , ” our daughter VBD , “ PRP fail life . ” PRP was too soon for NNS ’s fates to be decided by an institution WDT was supposed to serve DT JJ good . Read : Poor kids who believe in meritocracy suffer I wanted DT plan to succeed , but I had serious doubts . PRP came festooned with all DT authoritarian excess of DT JJ progressivism . PRP called for DT creation of a JJ diversity bureaucracy , and its relentless jargon squashed my hope IN DT authors knew how to achieve an excellent education for all . Instead of teaching civics WDT faced DT complex truths of American democracy , “ DT curriculum will highlight DT vast historical contributions of non-white groups & seek to dispel DT JJ non-truths / lies related to American & NNP History . ” “ Excellence ” was barely an afterthought in DT plan . Of its 64 action items , only CD even mentioned what was likely to be DT hardest problem : “ Provide support for [ district ] educators in adopting best practices for academically , racially & socioeconomically mixed classrooms . ” How to make sure IN NNS of greatly different abilities MD succeed , in schools WDT had long been academically tracked ? How to do PRP without giving up on rigor altogether — without losing DT fastest learners ? PRP had faced this problem with our daughter , who was reading far ahead of her grade in kindergarten and begged her teacher for math problems to solve . When DT school declined to accommodate her , and our applications to other JJ schools were unsuccessful , PRP transferred her to a JJ , STEM - focused private school rather than risk NNS of boredom . PRP regretted leaving DT NN - school system , and PRP were still wary of DT competitive excesses of meritocracy , but PRP were n’t willing to abandon PRP altogether . DT Department of Education did n’t seem to be thinking about meritocracy at all . Its entire focus was on achieving diversity , and on rooting out DT racism WDT stood in DT way of DT . Late in DT summer of 2018 , a JJ meeting was called in our district to discuss DT integration plan . PRP was DT height of vacation season , but several hundred parents , including me , showed up . JJ had just heard about DT JJ plan , which buried DT results of an internal poll showing IN a majority of parents wanted to keep DT old system . PRP were presented with a slideshow WDT included a photo of white adults snarling at black schoolchildren in DT South in DT 1960s — as if only vicious racism MD motivate parents to oppose eliminating an admissions system WDT met superior work with a more challenging placement . Even if DT placement was DT fruit of a large historical injustice , parents are compromised ; a policy WDT tells them to set aside their NNS ’s needs until DT injustice has been remedied is asking for failure . Just in case DT implication of racism was n’t enough to intimidate dissenters , when DT presentation ended , and dozens of hands shot up , CD of DT speakers , a progressive city - council member , announced IN he MD take no questions . He waved off DT uproar WDT ensued . PRP was just IN DT opt - out “ education session ” my wife had attended : DT deal was done . EX was only CD truth . • DT 9.9 Percent Is DT NNP American Aristocracy • Americans Have Given Up on JJ Schools . DT ’s a Mistake . De Blasio ’s schools chancellor , Richard Carranza , has answered critics of DT diversity initiative by calling them out for racism and refusing to let them “ silence ” him . As part of DT initiative , Carranza has mandated anti-bias training for every employee of DT school system , at a cost of $ 23 million . CD training slide was titled “ White Supremacy Culture . ” PRP included “ Perfectionism , ” “ Individualism , ” “ Objectivity , ” and “ Worship of DT Written Word ” among DT white - supremacist values WDT need to be disrupted . In DT name of exposing racial bias , DT training created its own kind . DT legacy of racism , together with a false meritocracy in America today WDT keeps NNS trapped where PRP are , is DT root cause of DT inequalities in DT city ’s schools . But calling out racism and getting rid of objective standards wo n’t create real equality or close DT achievement gap , and might have DT perverse effect of making PRP worse by driving out families of all races who cling to an idea of education based on real merit . If integration is a necessary condition for equality , PRP is n’t sufficient . Equality is too important to be left to an ideology WDT rejects universal values . In middle school our son immediately made friends with DT same kind of kids who had been his friends in elementary school — outsiders — including Latino boys from DT district ’s poorest neighborhood . CD day he told PRP about DT “ N - word passes ” WDT were being exchanged among other boys he knew — a system in which a black kid , bartering for some item , MD allow a white kid to use DT word . PRP MD n’t believe such a thing existed , but PRP did . When CD white boy kept using his pass all day long , our son grabbed DT imaginary piece of paper and ripped PRP to shreds . He and his friends heard DT official language of moral instruction so often IN PRP became a source of irony and teasing : “ Hey , dude , PRP really need to check your privilege . ” When his teacher assigned students to write about how PRP felt about their identity , letting DT class VB IN whiteness was a source of guilt for her , our son told her IN he MD n’t do PRP . DT assignment was too personal , and PRP did n’t leave enough space for him to describe all WDT made him who he was . “ Is n’t school for learning math and NN and reading , ” he asked PRP CD day , “ not for teachers to tell PRP what to VB about society ? ” He was responding as kids do when adults keep telling them what to VB . He had what my wife called unpoliticized empathy . Watching your NNS grow up gives PRP a startlingly vivid image of DT NN PRP ’re VBG to leave them . I ca n’t say I ’m sanguine . Some days DT image fills me with dread . DT pragmatic genius for which Americans used to be known and admired , which included a talent for educating our young — how did PRP desert PRP ? Now PRP ’re stewing in anxiety and anger , feverish with bad ideas , too absorbed in our own failures to spare our NNS . But CD day DT fever will break , and by then PRP ’ll be grown , and PRP will have to discover for themselves how to live together in a country WDT gives every child an equal chance ."

DT drugmaker plans a small launch at first , so PRP can see how DT digital - smart pill system works in DT real NN .

"" This initial limited rollout will be a crucial step in determining Otsuka ’s broader NN - to - market plan . "" Though Abilify pills are already available as generics , Otsuka has been working on broadening DT list of approvals for DT long - lasting injectable version . DT injection won a JJ use in bipolar disorder this NN . DT Abilify MyCite approval is a bigger breakthrough for Proteus , which has been working on drug - device combo pills for NNS . This first U.S. approval MD bode well for other JJ products in DT works , including sensor - embedded versions of generic blood pressure pill lisinopril and DT standard diabetes drug metformin . PRP was Otsuka and Proteus ' second try at DT FDA for DT digital version of Abilify .

Articles Archive : Habib ’s open letter to NNP Yorkers Schaffer ’s provocation to DT Pentagon Newsday ’s little briefing on Pentagon intimidation of Schaffer CD of these men is not on DT cover … Both are subject to intimidation for speaking out about 9/11 . Which is DT bigger story ? Let Newsday VB what PRP VBP ! Our previous story on DT Intikab Habib case was premature . PRP reported early Saturday morning IN NNP York Newsday published an article about NNS who reject DT NNP NN ’s account of DT September 11 events . DT story by Newsday Staff Writer Patricia Hurtado had already appeared on DT newsday.com website . But PRP later discovered IN DT editors kept PRP out of DT newspaper itself . ( DT applies to DT Long Island Saturday and “ Early Sunday ” editions , which are nearly identical in NN content ; DT story did run in DT lower - circulation NNP York City editions . ) Newsday ’s front pages on Friday , Saturday and “ Early Sunday ” featured Imam Intikab Habib of Corona , Queens – who expressed doubts IN DT alleged 9/11 hijackers were solely responsible for DT attacks on NNP York and Washington and DT fall of DT NNP Trade Center towers . An incoming chaplain to DT NNP York Fire Deparment , Habib was forced to resign just before taking his oath of office Friday morning . DT NN was accompanied by approving comments from Mayor Michael Bloomberg , FDNY Chief Nicholas Scopetta , and firefighters who were described as angered or offended by Habib ’s views on 9/11 . Habib ’s views became known to DT Fire Department only after DT first Newsday piece about him , printed just hours before his ouster . DT article , by Carol Eisenberg , noted IN in explaining his skepticism , “ Habib talked about video and NN reports widely disseminated in DT Muslim community . ” Hurtado ’s Saturday follow - up posed an important corrective by underlining IN beliefs IN Habib ’s are RB widespread far beyond DT Muslim community . As published , her piece was short , and PRP saddled 9/11 skeptics with DT usual “ NN theory ” label . But PRP was Newsday ‘s first look at DT 9/11 truth movement , mentioning 911 Truth.org among others . Hurtado RB reviewed DT 2004 Zogby poll finding IN CD - half of NNP York City residents believe NNP leaders “ consciously failed ” to prevent DT September 11th events . ( Newsday , “ Sept. 11 NN theories abound , ” Oct. 1 ) Hurtado and her colleague Eisenberg both told this author Friday PRP agreed PRP MD be false if DT Habib stories created DT impression IN 9/11 skepticism is somehow restricted to Muslims . ( 911 Truth.org , “ Incoming FDNY Chaplain Forced to Resign ” , Oct. 1 ) Newsday ‘s follow - up coverage in DT Saturday / ” Early Sunday ” Long Island editions featured almost two full pages on Habib ’s ouster . A box with more than enough space for DT Hurtado article was devoted instead to a potpourri of unrelated anecdotes about “ controversial remarks by prominent figures , ” some dating back as far as 1976 . ( Newsday , “ Some who put their foot in PRP , ” Oct. 1 ) What ’s Able Danger Got to Do With PRP ? To make matters worse , Newsday relegated DT weekend ’s biggest 9/11 - related story – DT Pentagon ’s investigation of Col Anthony Shaffer on charges WDT include DT alleged theft of pens – to a 170 - word briefing on Page 21 of DT same paper . DT charges against Shaffer were made JJ just days after DT Pentagon barred him and four other men from testifying to Congress on details of an elite military program , Able Danger , which PRP say tagged Mohamed Atta as an al - Qaeda terrorist operating in DT NNP NNPS at least CD NN before September 11 . ( See “ A Pentagon Whitewash ” ) Shaffer and DT four other whistleblowers with knowledge of DT program have told DT press IN in September 2000 , as - yet unidentified military brass ordered DT Able Danger crew to destroy all information on Atta and three other men later RB alleged to have been ringleaders and hijackers in DT 9/11 attacks . Able Danger was suspended altogether on DT accession of DT Bush administration in February 2001 . DT Pentagon has not disputed DT credibility of Shaffer or DT four other individuals who remember IN Atta was identified by Able Danger . But PRP has revoked Shaffer ’s security clearance . Now he faces charges IN he once flashed a military identification while drunk , obtained $ 68 in personal cell phone charges , and committed other , similarly earthshaking violations . ( See USA Today , Sept. 30 ) DT Able Danger revelations lend credence to earlier reports in overseas NN ( never covered by major NNP NN outlets ) IN DT alleged hijackers were under near - constant observation by NNP and allied foreign authorities for NNS . Some reports suggest IN DT men who MD be blamed for September 11th eluded early arrest only because PRP enjoyed high - level protection within DT NNP NN . ( See our earlier analysis of Able Danger and DT recent update . For DT latest developments , check DT 911 Citizens ’ Watch NEWSWIRE on DT front page . ) Where EX is no vision , DT NNS perish . – Newsday motto Now IN PRP ’ve read DT above , PRP are asking PRP right now to take five minutes to write a brief letter to Newsday , and urge them to VB their priorities in reporting NN about September 11th . This week presents DT best window of opportunity . Last NN , DT NNP York Times solicited and then rejected an editorial on DT unanswered questions of 9/11 by Cynthia McKinney and Catherine Austin Fitts . ( See “ Day of DT Dead : DT Haunting of DT White House , ” 11/1/04 ) Will Newsday show DT courage to open its editorial pages to even CD column voicing a skeptical perspective on September 11th ? DT only rule PRP absolutely beg PRP to follow is to be civil . If PRP hope to VB your missive published , PRP should pack a punch and run no more than 200 words . Keep in mind IN Newsday ( IN other newspapers ) will only publish letters WDT include a return address and phone number , so IN PRP can confirm PRP ’s really from PRP . Do mention if PRP live in DT NNP York area , or if PRP read or subscribe to Newsday in print or online . PRP do n’t care if PRP mention 911 Truth.org – pick DT 9/11 sites , authors and sources PRP prefer . DT idea is not to have a thousand NNS sending DT exact same message . This action will be most effective if PRP each write your own piece , so PRP are only giving PRP suggestions , of which PRP might cover CD or two along with your own ideas . DT point is not to pick on Newsday . Its style in DT Habib coverage has been sober and factual – in contrast to DT predictably hateful echo in certain other NNP York dailies . PRP is mainly by omission IN Newsday is distorting DT reality of DT Habib case , and of 9/11 as a whole . Newsday is CD of DT few major NNP dailies WDT still engages in investigative reporting – and DT MD actually decide to make a difference in ending DT September 11th cover - up and exposing DT co-perpetrators and collaborators likely to be found within our own NN and its covert agencies . After sending PRP to Newsday , PRP can RB post your missive here . And then PRP can send your friends DT link to this page ! 1 ) An imam who emigrated to NNP York from Guyana has been turned into DT American face of 9/11 skepticism , as though millions of Christians , Jews , Buddhists and atheists have n’t been harboring DT same doubts about September 11th for NNS . 2 ) As though a number of best - selling authors – several of them white guys in suits – have n’t already taken JJ stands , from David Ray Griffin to Michael Ruppert to Michel Chossudovsky . ( Cite your favorite book . Point out IN Griffin will be speaking on “ DT Destruction of DT NNP Trade Center ” in NNP York City on Oct. 15 – is n’t DT worthy of coverage ? ) 3 ) Emphasizing Habib while ignoring alternative researchers and DT 9/11 truth movement is unfair to DT Muslim community . Once again , Muslims are being singled out . By implication , PRP are different from other Americans . Muslims end up defined as DT ones who doubt DT official story , and who do so only because PRP are Muslims . 4 ) DT mass NN have cited almost exclusively angry reactions to Habib , including from Bloomberg and Scopetta . Someone reading this might VB IN all NNP Yorkers , at least DT non-Muslims , are automatically offended whenever anyone doubts DT Official Story of 9/11 . ( As of Monday afternoon , NN outlets had generated several hundred further stories on DT Habib case , according to a Google NN search . Most of these perpetuate DT paradigm WDT Habib ’s honest views constitute a slur to NNP Yorkers . ) 5 ) But DT Zogby poll , which Newsday has now acknowledged , suggests IN half of NNP Yorkers do n’t believe DT official story , and IN two - thirds VBP a JJ investigation . EX ’s no doubt IN a substantial number of Newsday ‘s readers agree . 6 ) This is RB unfair to DT millions of 9/11 skeptics around DT NN , whose opinions ( right or wrong ) derive from how PRP understand DT facts , and are usually unrelated to their religious beliefs . And why do stories about skeptics tend to focus on DT psychology WDT makes these “ NN theorists ” tick ? Should n’t Newsday and other newspapers at least report fairly on DT arguments NNS make for not believing DT official story ? 7 ) Skeptical views of 9/11 have received a first hearing on Capitol Hill thanks to Rep. Cynthia McKinney ( D - GA ) . This summer she hosted three days of presentations by alternative researchers , including David Ray Griffin , author of DT NNP Pearl Harbor . Was n’t DT worthy of coverage ? 8 ) DT first day of DT McKinney hearings ( July 22 ) opened with a CD - hour presentation by Mindy Kleinberg and Lorie van Auken , two of DT “ Jersey Widows ” who fought to gain DT 9/11 Commission in DT first place . Point by well - documented point , PRP rejected DT 9/11 Commission Report as a whitewash . DT views of DT Jersey wives were considered worthy of coverage in DT past , when PRP supported DT 9/11 Commission . Why not now ? 9 ) DT McKinney hearings were subsequently aired on C - SPAN , which RB broadcast Nafeez Ahmed ’s session at DT DC Emergency Truth Convergence and DT historic Madison speech by David Ray Griffin ( transcript here ) . 10 ) What about other members of Sept. 11th families who have gone on record to demand full truth disclosure ? Donna Marsh O’Connor , mother of Vanessa Lang Langer , spoke at DT September 11th , 2005 Rally to End DT NNP Blackout in NNP York City . Bob McIlvaine , father of Robert McIlvaine , presided alongside McKinney as a Citizens ’ Commissioner at DT 9/11 Omissions Hearings in NNP York in September 2004 . Fifty families of September 11th and CD hundred notables spanning DT political spectrum signed DT 911 Truth Statement – including DT three leading third - party candidates in DT 2004 election . Habib , Shaffer and Others Pay DT Price for Staying True to Themselves 11 ) Habib has been punished for opinions WDT he clearly did not intend to express in his capacity as chaplain ; opinions he did not express when participating in DT Fire Department ’s 9/11 ceremonies two weeks before ; opinions WDT became known only because of direct questions from Newsday . On top of being run out of DT job , he now feels compelled to engage in a sackcloth - and - ashes ritual , as evidenced by his open letter . 12 ) Meanwhile , a whistleblower IN Col. Anthony Shaffer reveals IN DT Pentagon knew DT alleged 9/11 hijackers , thought PRP were potential terrorists , and ordered DT evidence destroyed a NN before Sept. 11 . And for speaking out , Shaffer has harvested a muzzle , intimidation , and ludicrous charges designed to destroy him personally . Should PRP be thankful IN DT Shaffer story at least made Page 21 ? 13 ) Habib and Shaffer join DT ranks of others who have been harrassed , fired , demoted or forced to resign after voicing alternative views or bringing up uncomfortable facts about September 11th . Prominent examples include FBI translator Sibel Edmonds , FBI Special Agent Robert Wright , NNP Air Force Colonel Steven Butler , and Underwriters Laboratories executive Kevin Ryan . ( Ryan was fired after questioning DT official story on how DT Towers collapsed . See DT column of previous stories here , under Ongoing . ) 14 ) Always remember IN DT official story itself is a NN theory . If DT alleged captured masterminds of 9/11 – Khalid Sheikh Mohamed and Ramzi Binalshibh – are ever indicted in NNP courts , PRP will be charged under our country ’s voluminous NN laws . ( Well , if PRP really are alive and in NNP custody , but DT ’s another story . ) 15 ) DT idea IN Saddam Hussein had any connection to 9/11 ( as propagated by DT Vice NNP among others ) surely qualifies as an “ outrageous NN theory , ” CD without basis in confirmable or even reported fact . 16 ) JJ NNS abhor DT naked exploitation of DT 9/11 events to enable an extremist agenda and a bogus “ War on Terror ” WDT has transformed America and DT NN . JJ in addition have come to believe DT attacks were allowed , facilitated or even engineered by elements of DT NNP covert - policy apparatus so as to gain popular support for DT agenda . 17 ) Further suspicion is raised by DT way official investigations IN DT 9/11 Commission completely ignored bodies of evidence pointing towards foreknowledge or complicity by NNP officials . A few of DT Top 15 Reasons to Doubt DT Official Story All ignored or trivialized by DT 9/11 Commission – Military wargames on Sept. 11th itself improbably mirrored DT 9/11 scenario , apparently confusing air defense response and providing cover for DT actual attacks . – DT various stories of DT air defense failure as told by Gen. Richard Myers , NORAD , FAA , DT 9/11 Commission and USAF keep changing and conflict with each other . No NN has ever been held accountable for upholding false accounts . – In fact , no NN in NN has ever been held accountable for any 9/11 - related failure . If all of DT failures are really due to incompetence , DT ’s almost as frightening as DT idea IN 9/11 was an inside job . – DT highest members of DT military chain of command showed a consistent and suspicious pattern of no response during most of DT actual NN of DT attacks . Bush , Rumsfeld , Myers , Gen. Montague Winfield of DT National Military Command Center and Adm. Richard Mies of Stratcom each either went missing or found better things to do than to assume DT duties of their offices . ( See DT wargames review for a summary of their ( in)activities on Sept. 11 . ) – DT Pakistani ISI money connection to DT alleged hijackers was steadfastly ignored by DT 9/11 Commissioners , who even made DT astonishing admission ( p. 172 ) IN PRP VBP DT open question of who financed DT hijackers is “ of little practical significance . ” DT motto seems to be : Do n’t follow DT money ! – DT JJ reports of insider trading internationally , based on apparent foreknowledge of DT attacks , VBP far beyond DT “ put options ” incidents . ( DT 9/11 Commission VBD DT well - known short - sells on NNP and American airlines are insignificant , because DT buyers had “ no conceivable connection ” to Al Qaeda . As though PRP were a natural law WDT only NNS inside Al Qaeda MD have ever known about 9/11 in advance . ) – DT dozen - plus warnings from foreign agencies , some of whom even delivered names of DT future alleged hijackers ( DT same four names as came up in Able Danger ! ) . At no point did DT Commission treat any of these – PRP ’s as though reports from outside DT NNP never existed . – DT consistent blocking of FBI investigations WDT might have uncovered DT future hijackers , in a fashion WDT suggests high - level obstruction more readily than bureaucratic antagonisms or incompetence . – DT march of visibly different “ Osamas ” appearing in DT various Bin Ladin videos , all of which are of dubious provenance . Who knows which is DT real NN ? – DT JJ historical precedents for false - flag terror attacks arranged by an unaccountable secret policy apparatus ; and DT precedents for false casus belli , from “ Remember DT Maine ” to DT Gulf of Tonkin . – DT case IN DT NNP Trade Center towers and WTC 7 were demolished . Why have DT major NNP York papers refused to ask Larry Silverstein what he meant when he VBD IN Building 7 was pulled ? Our democracy is seriously endangered by DT Bush administration ’s post - 9/11 policies , which make no sense whatsoever if PRP are intended to combat terrorism ; but which make perfect sense in DT context of DT desperate grab for NN power desired by DT Project for A NNP American Century . Dear Honorable Mayor , members of DT Fire Department , and NNP Yorkers , I am humbly writing this letter to PRP , clarifying DT statement I made on Thursday , [ September ] 29 2005 . I was asked several times by a NN reporter about DT coincidence of my Islamic education being from Saudi Arabia and DT CD hijackers of September 11th RB being from Saudi - whether DT MD place a barrier between myself and DT fire fighters ? I innocently explained to her after she asked me to this effect several times , IN I personally do not really VB who committed DT 9/11 attacks based on DT conflicting information WDT I heard from DT NN . My response in this context was only meant innocently to tell her IN , not knowing who committed DT attack avails me DT idling consciousness of how my fire fighter brothers and sisters MD look at me , and PRP makes me assimilate very smoothly with this department and thus , EX should absolutely be no barriers . DT NN reporter ’s further inquiries as to DT reasons why I am not really certain who committed DT 9/11 attacks prompted me to mention DT conflicting information WDT I heard from DT NN . My Mayor , Fire Fighters , and NNP Yorkers , this was DT first NN I was ever interviewed by DT NN and I did n’t VB IN all of my innocent and friendly chat with this reporter MD be placed in DT NN to cause such an outrage with my NNP Yorker ’s brothers and sisters . I regret any inconveniences my words MD have caused . This incident is very difficult on me , my family , and DT Muslim community . I hope PRP , DT members of DT Fire Department , and DT NNP Yorkers can find PRP in your hearts to see my innocence , and IN I never meant to be insensitive to DT families who have lost love ones on 9/11 . PRP was a pleasure working for this City in DT capacity of a chaplain in DT Fire Department . I had a wonderful NN serving my fire fighter brothers and sisters . PRP felt as if PRP were a big family . PRP was very hard for me to accept IN DT day I was to be sworn in as a chaplain , I ended up resigning . I am sure life has JJ lessons to learn . In conclusion my respected Mayor , fire fighters , and NNP Yorkers , I MD VB to VB IN neither I nor any other true Muslim in this beautiful country , in any way condone DT 9/11 attacks . PRP was tragic , sad , and unfortunate . NNP Almighty God guide and bless our Mayor and DT citizens of our land . SIDEBAR ‘ Here is this gaunt figure ’ in 2000 photo WASHINGTON — PRP was shortly after Sept. 11 , 2001 , IN Anthony Shaffer says he learned from a Pentagon contractor whose Able / Danger data had not been destroyed IN DT information gathered by DT project DT NN before included Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta , whose name and photo had quickly become recognizable around DT NN . “ PRP had coffee and talked about this issue , ” Shaffer VBD . “ She ’s DT NN who brought PRP to my attention : ` Oh , by DT way , here ’s CD of DT charts from before 9/11 . ’ PRP was CD of those open - source data runs , and PRP showed DT picture . ” PRP was not , Shaffer VBD , DT menacing Florida driver ’s license photo of Atta WDT has become an emblem of DT attacks . “ Here is this gaunt figure , ” Shaffer recalled . “ He ’s very distinctive .

PRP was not DT best picture in DT NN . ” But Shaffer VBD he has no doubt DT face in DT picture was Mohamed Atta DT hijacker . “ No , ” he VBD . “ Same guy . ” Within days of his conversation with DT contractor , someone associated with Able / Danger brought DT chart to Rep. Curt Weldon ( R - Pa. ) , whose House subcommittee on military technology had funded Able / Danger . DT contractor did not return a message left on her home answering machine . But Weldon told DT Senate Judiciary Committee last week IN on Sept. 25 , 2001 , he took DT Atta chart to Stephen Hadley , then DT deputy to National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice . She is now secretary of NN and Hadley is national security adviser . “ He VBD to me , and I remember this quote , ` I ’ve got to show this to DT Man , ' ” Weldon testified . “ I VBD , ` DT Man ? ’ He VBD , ` Yes , DT NN of DT NNP NNPS . ' ” Hadley ’s spokesman , Frederick Jones II , VBD Hadley vaguely recalled having been shown a chart portraying “ link analysis ” of DT sort done by Able / Danger . But , Jones VBD , Hadley did not remember seeing Atta ’s name or photo on DT chart , whether PRP was Weldon or someone else who showed PRP to him , or whether DT person left DT chart with him or took PRP away . Shaffer , an Army Reserve officer who sat in DT audience at DT hearing in his uniform , was placed on paid administrative leave from his civilian job after his security clearance was lifted , after an investigation into possibly improper expense reports amounting to under $ 300 . Shaffer maintains DT reports were not improper and says he plans to appeal DT suspension of his clearance . Weldon VBD EX was “ no doubt in my mind ” IN DT security clearance had been suspended in response to Shaffer ’s efforts to make DT Atta story NN . Pentagon intelligence officials say IN while PRP cannot find a copy of DT Atta chart , PRP do not dispute DT credibility of Shaffer or DT four other individuals who remember having seen PRP . “ DT fact IN DT our NN had this information at CD NN , and possibly destroyed PRP , is haunting , ” Weldon says , adding IN he does not believe DT military ’s account IN DT Able / Danger data were destroyed only to comply with Pentagon regulations . “ I seriously have my doubts IN PRP was routine , ” he says . An officer who has claimed IN a classified military unit identified four Sept. 11 hijackers before DT 2001 attacks is facing Pentagon accusations of breaking numerous rules , charges his lawyer suggests are aimed at undermining his credibility . DT alleged infractions by Army Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer , 42 , include obtaining a service medal under false pretenses , improperly flashing military identification while drunk , and stealing pens , according to paperwork from DT Pentagon ’s Defense Intelligence Agency . Shaffer was CD of DT first to publicly link 9/11 leader Mohamed Atta to DT unit code - named Able Danger and CD of five witnesses DT Pentagon ordered not to appear Sept. 21 before DT Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss DT unit ’s findings . DT military revoked Shaffer ’s top security clearance this month , a day before he was supposed to testify to a congressional committee . Mark Zaid , Shaffer ’s attorney , VBD he can’t prove DT Pentagon went after Shaffer because he ’s a whistleblower , but “ all DT timing associated with DT clearance issue has been suspiciously coincidental . ”"

This is DT third NN DT Obama administration has pushed Congress for an expanded federal - NN partnership for school for 4 - NN - olds , which proponents say MD help close DT performance gap for NNS from low - or moderate - income families . DT Congressional Budget Office noted DT $ 66 - billion price tag in a report , released March 29 , on DT NN ’s 2017 budget . But Ross Whitehurst , a clinical child psychologist and senior fellow with DT Brookings Institute , questions DT plan . “ For most kids , EX ’s no substantial benefit , and maybe some harm , from attending pre-K , ” he told AMI Newswire . Whitehurst refers to a NN out of Vanderbilt University last fall WDT found students in Tennessee ’s $ 213 - million preschool program ultimately performed worse than their non-preschool counterparts by DT end of second grade . DT Vanderbilt NN VBD participants in a preschool program were better prepared for , and performed better during , kindergarten than their counterparts , but IN DT benefits did n’t last . Whitehurst noted DT federal NN already has a “ mismash ” of programs directed at early learning WDT cost about $ 14 billion per NN , according to testimony he gave two NNS ago before a House committee . “ I do not oppose spending more , but EX are JJ aspects of DT administration ’s plan WDT I do n’t VB , ” he VBD . Although not an opponent of preschool programs , Whitehurst expressed concern IN DT latest proposal , virtually identical to DT ones before PRP , represented Washington “ taking over ” DT early childhood process , calling PRP a “ pretty big foot ” in DT door of federal control of what has been , to this point , a NN - driven program . • More : Once again , loud and clear : School funding not tied to educational outcomes and achievement Texas , for example , provides preschool to certain NNS , including those who are homeless , cared for by active duty service members , or unable to speak or comprehend English . DT proposed program MD actually cost about $ 120 billion over DT next 10 NNS , with NNS opting into DT program and chipping in 40 percent of DT costs , Whitehurst noted . Similar to DT Affordable Care Act ’s Medicare expansion provisions , DT Preschool for All bill MD require NNS to opt-in to DT program in order to receive federal funding . In its latest report , DT Congressional Budget Office gave lower overall estimates than DT Department of Education due , in part , to DT expectation IN some NNS MD initially reject DT program . In a memo on DT 2017 Budget , DT Obama Administration suggest costs MD be paid for , in part , through increased tobacco taxes . Although Whitehurst is skeptical of a universal program , he VBD studies do show preschool helps NNS from non-English - speaking homes learn English more quickly in preparation for kindergarten . PRP RB helps low - income families receive a form of free child care . He advocates programs WDT more directly target these groups , but VBD proponents of universal preschool worry targeted programs , particularly those for DT poor , MD not receive widespread political support . “ As I see PRP , I try to represent what research says , ” he VBD . “ PRP ’s not my goal to play DT political game , but to understand how much PRP do n’t VB , understand DT research limitations . ” Whitehurst VBD “ elevating ” preschool might be a bad idea for DT stated goal of reducing achievement gaps , when DT money MD VB to programs showing more promise in addressing DT goal . A National Bureau of NNP Research NN on 106 students in a Chicago - based math - tutoring program found 9th - graders , on average , were able to develop math skills in CD NN what DT average student developed in three NNS , closing DT equivalent of two - thirds of DT education gap between black and white students . According to Whitehurst , who spoke about DT program at a Brooking ’s Institute talk last week , DT Chicago program costs about $ 3,000 per student . “ If PRP gave me a choice between spending $ 3,000 to VB a bunch of kids — who are VBG to drop out because PRP ’re failing at math — up to speed , or spending $ 9,000 on a NN on pre-K for every child in general , I choose DT former , ” Whitehurst VBD . DT program is among DT largest items in an education budget proposed by Obama WDT , according to DT Congressional Budget Office , MD add $ 152 billion to DT deficit over DT next decade .

Hood , DT 14,000 - foot blizzard - shrouded peak just outside Portland , Oregon . Massive , standing nearly nine feet tall and weighing all of 900 pounds , he strode down DT wooded ridges , north and east to DT 7,000 - foot level where DT spring snow lay wet and heavy in forests 50 miles from DT nearest road . At DT 4,000 - foot level , DT thick coniferous forests thinned and DT deep mountain gorges leveled out . PRP was late June , 1971 , and DT lower rivers raged with DT waters of DT melting snow pack . At DT 3,000 - foot level DT first growths of douglas fir and oak gave way to a few scrub oak , growing singly . From a high point on DT ridge WDT runs down from Mt. Hood called Seven Mile Hill , he MD see DT lights of DT Dalles , Oregon , where 11,000 NNS lived . Fifteen miles upriver DT Wy - am Indians , roped to their platforms perched over DT boiling river , netted spring chinook salmon by DT hundreds with their long poles . This PRP had done every spring since prehistory . DT Great Food is what DT Wy - am call salmon ; and perhaps he had come down to DT semi-arid insecurity of DT Dalles to scramble on DT banks of DT river for DT Great Food during CD of DT largest salmon runs on DT North American Continent . Some who theorize about him VBP IN he came down to this narrow point in DT river where EX is little current because an island breaks DT swim to Washington and DT Cascade Range — where DT deer and huckleberries are plentiful in DT summer . East DT land opens to treeless rolling hills . Great high - tension towers converge on DT Chenowith Converter and scar DT land as far as DT eye can see . EX was no cover for him RB . But to swim DT river from here , four miles west of DT Dalles , he had only to cross two roads : DT old highway to Portland , NNP 30 , and DT JJ Interstate , 80N . Things had changed since he had last been down to DT river . EX was an aluminum plant nearby , a JJ shopping center , a Rocket gas station , a JJ and used car lot , and — strangest of all for him during DT nights — DT Dalles drive - in which specializes in films IN Deathmaster and DT Two - Headed Thing . In DT early daylight hours of this first day of June , 1971 , he stood in a small meadow above what had been a large foothill apple orchard . PRP was now filled with flat electrified platforms and called DT Pinewood Mobile Manor . Joe Mederios , maintenance man for DT trailer court , was watering flowers near his trailer DT morning . Directly across NNP 30 is a large fenced meadow . At about 150 yards a rocky ledge of perhaps 35 feet banks a higher meadow . Mederios caught a movement along DT ledge from a corner of his eye . He assumed PRP was George Johnson , DT owner of DT land , and went back to watering his flowers . But his mind was engaged in a curious and unconscious arithmetic . He had seen Johnson on DT land previously — PRP was n’t unusual — but this figure was too big … DT arms were too long … DT shoulders too broad . Mederios turned to DT ridge for a longer look . What he saw was a shaggy , gray figure he took to be at least ten feet tall . PRP had an oval face and a crest or dorsal ridge along DT top of its head . DT face was flat , brown and hairless . DT man turned back to his flowers and considered his situation . He was responsible to some Portland businessmen who MD be down to DT Dalles DT next day . If he were to report DT sighting , EX MD be deputies and curiosity - seekers tromping all over his carefully watered flowers about DT NN his bosses arrived . Mederios later told Sheriff ’s deputy Rich Carlson IN he did n’t report DT incident for fear he ’d “ be called a nut . ” DT next day , around noon , DT three businessmen met Mederios and were in DT midst of discussions in a trailer office fronting DT meadow when Mederios again saw an erect ape - JJ figure through a window . DT four men ran outside and watched from across DT road as PRP moved through a break in DT ridge and came into DT lower meadow where PRP walked among DT sparse scrub oak near DT rocks . PRP stopped near a small tree , and from where DT men stood , PRP appeared to be somewhat taller than DT tree . DT four men and DT other creature stared at CD another for perhaps a minute , before PRP turned , went up through DT break in DT rocks and disappeared into DT upper meadow . This NN DT sighting was reported and deputy Carlson went out to investigate . From Carlson ’s report filed on June 2nd , ’ 71 : “ Mr. Mederios … described PRP as being about ten feet tall , greyish in color , real wide shoulders and arms WDT hung way down . He went on to say PRP looked IN an overgrown ape . He stated PRP was not a bear . DT creature was walking upright at DT NN of DT sighting . ” DT Portland men , solid citizens all , confirmed DT sighting and description . DT same night , about 9:30 , when DT last summer light was fading in DT meadow , a man named Rich Brown , a high - school music teacher , and his wife were returning from a choir practice he had been conducting . At DT entrance to DT trailer court , Brown ’s wife either shouted or screamed and pointed to a figure in DT lower meadow . Brown swung his car around and put DT headlights stark into DT meadow . He was joined by a second car , and eventually Mederios , who stepped out of DT office to see why DT cars were blocking DT entrance . At a distance of about 65 yards DT creature froze and stared into DT lights . Brown sprinted for his trailer , grabbed a Winchester 30.06 with a four - power scope . He opened his car door and steadied DT rifle . He considered a shot at DT heart , then DT head . With DT scope cross -hairs squarely between DT thing ’s expressionless flat black eyes , he released DT safety . IN any good marksman , Brown squeezes DT trigger slowly . In DT moment between DT final squeeze and DT shot , Rich Brown , who had just come from a church , made a complicated moral decision . “ I MD n’t shoot PRP , ” he VBD later , “ because PRP looked more human than animal . ” Aside from Indian legends , which are virtually timeless , DT Bigfoot saga on DT North American Continent begins in 1811 when DT explorer David Thompson noted in his daily journal DT track of “ a large animal … DT whole is about 14 inches by eight inches wide , ” in DT Canadian Rockies by DT site of what is now Jasper , Alberta . Several months later Thompson found similar tracks which he followed for nearly 100 yards . “ Reports from DT old times , ” he noted offhandedly , “ had made DT head branches of this river and DT mountains in DT vicinity DT abode of apes or more very large animals . ” In July of 1884 , a Victoria , British Columbia , newspaper , DT Daily Colonist , published an account of DT capture of a gorilla - type animal DT miners called Jacko . About 4 ’ 7 ″ tall and weighing about 125 pounds , DT animal MD have been a young Bigfoot . No other mention can be found of Jacko in DT Daily Colonist . DT Seattle Times reported a series of bizarre great ape sightings around Mt. St. Lawrence near Kelso , Washington , in July of 1918 . In 1924 , a group of miners camped near Mt. St. Helen in Washington claimed a horde of giant ape - JJ creatures attacked them in DT middle of DT night . CD was shot and rolled into a deep canyon which is known today as Ape Canyon . RB in 1924 , a prospector named Albert Ostman claimed IN while camping near Vancouver he was picked up in his sleeping bag and carried 25 miles by a giant hairy ape . PRP arrived in a sheltered valley where he was curiously observed for several days by a family of four Bigfeet . He eventually fed them chewing tobacco and escaped while PRP were sick . In 1940 , DT Chapmans , an Amerindian Indian family living near DT Fraser River in British Columbia , claimed a giant hairy ape walked out of DT woods and turned over a massive barrel of salt fish in DT shed . Footprints were left and local residents reported , PRP were 16 inches long and eight inches wide . DT stride length was about four feet . Mrs. Chapman VBD DT creature was about eight feet tall . American sightings made national headlines in DT Bluff Creek area of Northern California in October of 1958 . On DT ninth of DT month , DT Humboldt Times reported IN Jerry Crew , a road builder for DT Granite Logging Company , made a cast of a huge footprint — 16 inches long — he found on DT damp bed of a newly built lumbering access road . DT stride was 50 inches long , he VBD , and ran along DT road for a distance of about three quarters of a mile . Five days later two construction workers for DT same company were driving along a remote mountain road late at night when PRP saw what PRP took to be DT owner of DT prints . Ray Kerr , then 43 , VBD , “ PRP ran upright IN a man , swinging long hairy arms … PRP looked eight to ten feet tall to me . ” Tracks found DT next morning were identical to DT first set . Interviewed in DT Humboldt Times , Ray Wallace , a partner in DT logging firm , denied IN he had perpetrated a hoax . “ Who knows anyone foolish enough to ruin their own business , ” he VBD . Fifteen men had quit their jobs since DT sightings . Workers reported IN PRP saw nothing during DT day but IN every morning PRP found huge and apparently curious prints around DT equipment . Huge gasoline drums had been turned over . Some workers had DT uncomfortable sensation IN PRP were being watched during DT day . “ I ’ve got three tractors up RB without operators , man , ” Wallace complained . “ And all my brush - cutting crew has quit . ” Dr. Maurice Tripp , a geophysicist from Los Gatos , California , made casts of DT prints which proved IN DT toes showed mechanical function . After studying DT soil and DT depth of DT print , Tripp estimated DT probable creature ’s weight at 800 pounds . None of his casts showed impact ridges which MD have indicated IN PRP were made by some kind of mechanical stomping machine . Another series of prints , 1,089 in all , were discovered near Bossberg , Washington , in October of 1969 . DT tracks measured 17 ½ ” x 7 ″ . DT right foot seemed to be twisted inwards and calluses on DT outside of DT foot and DT extrapolated bone structure indicated DT creature who made DT prints had a clubfoot . Dr. Grover Krantz , a physical anthropologist at Washington NNP University , studied casts of DT Bossberg prints and concluded IN if DT tracks were hoaxed , DT fakers were “ absolute experts in human anatomy . ” Since DT ’ 58 Bluff Creek sightings , hundreds more have been recorded , some less credible than others . While Albert Ostman only claimed to have been kidnapped by Bigfeet , CD Helen Westring confessed , right on DT front page of DT National Bulletin ( July , 1969 ) , I WAS RAPED BY AN ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN . Seems IN while Helen was out hunting CD day in DT Minnesota woods she was attacked by a giant horny ape who stripped her of her flimsy clothes in a thrice and had his hairy way with her right RB on DT mute forest loam . EX are JJ men hunting Bigfoot on a more or less regular basis , and CD of DT most impressive is a 46 - NN - old , Dublin - born former big - game hunter named Peter Byrne . Financed by Ohio businessman Tom Page and several others who wish to remain anonymous , Byrne has CD paid assistant , two young volunteers , two International Scout jeeps , a pickup truck , a helicopter on 24 - hour notice , and a plethora of equipment including infrared night - scopes and sophisticated tranquilizer guns . Byrne , who does not take a salary from expedition funds but lives off his own income , has a Hemingwayesque history . In NNP War II he flew for DT RAF , and subsequently ended up as assistant manager of a tea plantation in Nepal . He once effected DT rescue of an Everest expedition stranded by an avalanche at DT 20,000 - foot level . For 15 NNS he led big - game hunts in Africa . In 1968 , with DT game thinning out ( more from poachers than hunters ) , Byrne wearied of leading bumbling clients through DT brush and pointing them at DT animals he had come to respect . He organized DT nonprofit International Wildlife Conservation Society . As executive director , Byrne spent two NNS creating two large tiger sanctuaries in Nepal . DT project was completed in November of 1970 . While in Nepal , Byrne had become fascinated with DT legend of DT Yeti ( DT perhaps mythical Abominable Snowman , cousin to DT perhaps mythical Bigfoot ) . He disputed DT findings of Sir Edmund Hillary ’s 1960 Yeti hunting expedition , insisting IN a month search did n’t constitute a real effort to find DT beast . DT Yeti scalp Hillary took from a Tibetan monastery had been analyzed as a goat - and antelope - hair fabrication , proving , to Hillary ’s satisfaction , IN none of DT sacred Yeti relics in any of DT monasteries were authentic . Byrne felt IN DT scalp Hillary found was a copy of an original he never saw . Byrne himself had visited half a dozen of DT monasteries and in CD secretly cut DT thumb from a mummified hand . He wired a mummified human thumb to DT palm and sent DT relic to NNS in Paris , then London , then DT NNP NNPS . In all NNS DT NNS came up with DT inconclusive conclusion IN DT thumb was not human , IN PRP was animal , and IN further , PRP was unclassifiable . In DT Himalayas , only two Europeans have claimed Yeti sightings . Byrne , fascinated with DT hypothetical creatures to a point just short of obsession , knew IN EX were hundreds of sightings in DT Pacific Northwest . In 1971 he organized DT present three - NN search . He has , to date , logged hundreds of thousands of miles on DT jeeps , interviewed hundreds of claimants , talked at length to DT Indians about their legends and knowledge of DT apes , and camped in DT woods in various sighting areas nearly a NN ’s worth of elapsed NN . Byrne regards as his strongest piece of evidence an 18 - second piece of film taken by CD Roger Patterson near Bluff Creek in DT early afternoon hours of October 7th , 1967 . Patterson , a small rancher and weekend Bigfoot hunter from Yakima , Washington , had spent four NNS and thousands of dollars on his search . He claims to have been on horseback in DT Bluff Creek area with Bob Gimlin , his tracker , when PRP caught sight of a female Bigfoot crouched by a stream . Patterson ’s horse spooked and nearly threw him . He pulled his camera from his saddlebag and ran toward DT creature , trying to focus simultaneously . DT 16 mm color film begins with a wild , jerking view of DT manzanita underbrush . DT camera steadies , pans right , and focuses in on an erect , apelike figure which appears to be about 30 feet away . PRP walks , at a slight angle to camera , into a thickly wooded area and disappears . PRP turns once toward DT camera and its face shows large black eyes , a small nose , a massive jaw , and a crest or ridge on DT head . Muscle movement can be seen in DT upper right thigh . When DT right arm swings back , large , hair - covered breasts become visible . Patterson , apparently anxious to validate his film , took a lie detector test which he passed . He submitted DT film to DT Smithsonian ’s director of primate biology , John Napier ( now visiting professor of primate biology at DT University of London ) , who has expressed his doubts in DT recently published book Bigfoot . DT walk seems to Napier “ self - consciously ” fluid . DT stride is essentially DT of a human male while DT filmed creature is female . DT crest is a male feature on orangutans and gorillas , seldom seen in females . DT heavy buttocks seen in DT Patterson film are a human feature , out of place on DT apelike superstructure . Furthermore , DT 14 ″ x 7 ″ prints — on a human scale — MD indicate a creature nearly eight feet tall while both Byrne and Napier have estimated DT height of DT Patterson creature at about 6 ’ 6 ″ . Napier concludes his discussion of DT film by saying IN he wo n’t proclaim PRP a hoax almost solely because , “ I can not see DT zipper . ” Byrne respectfully disagrees . “ Napier is using human formulas to deal with an unknown quantity , ” he says . Byrne published DT results of a NN ’s investigation in DT prestigious Explorers Journal . His case for DT existence of DT Giant Apes ( which he calls Omah , after DT local Indians ) , briefly and inadequately summarized , is as follows : 1 ) . EX are hundreds of thousands of virtually unexplored and roadless wilderness areas in DT Pacific Northwest . DT habitat of DT Omah might be in DT steep , thickly wooded gorges of this region . 2 ) . These same areas support black and brown bear . If DT Omah were an omnivore , with a diet roughly similar to DT of a bear , DT forests MD easily support a small Omah population . 3 ) . EX have been few sightings , because IN most primates , DT Omah is wary of man . ( First reports of African gorillas in DT early 17th century were treated as folklore . Not until DT middle of DT 19th century did Europeans succeed in tracking down DT shy beasts . ) Byrne does not speculate on DT origin of Omah , though when pressed he will mention DT fossil remains of a Chinese primate anthropologists call Gigantopithecus . “ Its estimated height was between ten and 12 feet and DT fossils were discovered in an area of NNP NNS VBP provided DT native American population , DT Eskimos and DT Indians . ” DT theory , of course , is IN nomadic tribes migrated across DT frozen Bering Strait . “ A case , I VBP , can be made for Gigantopithecus as an ancestor to Omah , ” Byrne says . Currently living in a trailer in DT Dalles , Byrne is still deeply involved in DT hunt . If he should come on CD of DT animals , he plans to dart PRP and keep PRP subdued for several days . A team of NNS have agreed to fly in at any NN at his expense . PRP MD land in Portland and helicopter to DT site . RB PRP MD take photos , measurements , urine , stool and blood samples . DT Omah MD then be set free . I asked if a tranquilizer capable of bringing down a beast WDT MD conceivably weigh up to 1,000 pounds MD n’t kill a man hoaxed up in a gorilla suit . “ No , ” Byrne says , and adds wryly : “ Unfortunately , DT safety margin is quite high . DT drug has been tested on volunteer prisoners . PRP simply puts a man under for quite a long period without harming him . PRP can , however , quote me as saying I MD be delighted to put a dart in DT ass of any jerk wearing a fur suit for my benefit . ” I am indebted to Sgt. Jack Robertson of DT Dalles Sheriff ’s department for a bit of woodsy Omah lore . “ If PRP should be out in DT woods without a weapon , ” he VBD , “ and PRP see Bigfoot , just throw some crap in his face and he ’ll run away . PRP hate DT . ” “ What am I VBG to do if EX is n’t any crap around ? ” “ Listen , ” Robertson VBD , “ if PRP ’re out in DT woods alone and PRP see him , EX ’ll be plenty of crap around . ” Flora Thompson is 74 NNS old , a Wy - am Indian who lives at Celilo Falls , DT prime salmon netting spot on DT Columbia River , which her tribe calls “ Wauna . ” Flora studied and learned DT legends of DT Wy - am from her late husband , DT great chief Tommy Thompson , who died at 108 in 1951 . She can tell about DT NN before men when all DT animals were NNS and were giants . Coyote was DT Changer . He dug a trench from DT great eastern lake to DT ocean so DT salmon MD swim upstream . In this way Coyote made DT NN fit for man . In DT Changing NNP , just after EX were men , EX was another beast . As Flora Thompson describes PRP , PRP is very much IN DT Omah in DT Patterson film . PRP was a female and its name was Tlat - ta - chee -ah . “ PRP use Tlat - ta - chee -ah as a scarecrow , ” Flora says . “ PRP tell DT bad NNS IN she will come to eat them if PRP do n’t behave . ” DT Wy - am are not DT only tribe WDT have legends about giant , ape - JJ creatures . JJ tribes call him Sasquatch . In British Columbia , DT Salish call him Stwanitie . DT Quamault of DT Olympic Peninsula call him Seeakwa . In Alberta he is called Tsonqua and Ghaga , and in Northern California , DT Hoopa call him Kadonkwa . In DT Central Pacific Northwest JJ tribes call him Omah . Peter Byrne in his investigation has talked to JJ of DT tribes in DT general sighting areas . Two elderly Indians on DT Colville reservation located in Northeastern Washington told him IN their grandfathers spoke of seeing up to 20 Omah catching salmon during run on DT Columbia River . In DT 1850s , PRP VBD , DT Omah caught DT white man ’s NN and died . Another legend prevalent in DT Northwest is IN EX were once JJ Omah and PRP lived not only in DT forests , but RB far to DT south and in DT plains of DT east . DT Indians warred with them , and by DT NN DT white man came , PRP were all gone . Item : At twilight in a small mountain town in Northern California , a clerk in DT general store thought she saw a large , hair - covered animal she took to be Bigfoot . Within an hour a large armed crowd had gathered in front of DT store , ready to hunt DT beast . Investigation showed IN DT beast was actually a prankster , a high - school boy who had thrown a fur over his head . From a letter to Deputy Carlson , dated November 25th , 1972 : “ I believe from reading DT article about DT Bigfoot search IN PRP is a man dressed in a gorilla suit so NNS do not kill him , he is probably getting a big kick out of doing his thing , scaring NNS . DT article VBD PRP looked IN a man . DT ’s what PRP was — a man — in costume . If PRP attend a Halloween dance in costume in Los Angeles PRP MD see plenty of Yeti , dancing with DT girls . I ’ve seen plenty of these outfits , so do not shoot him , he ’s having fun . ” Excerpt from a conversation with a deputy sheriff in DT Dalles , Oregon : “ Now I ’m not saying IN a critter IN DT actually exists . I ’ve been hunting this part of DT country for almost 20 NNS , and I ’ve never seen hide nor hair of CD . But if I did see CD , PRP damn betcha PRP ’s a dead NN . PRP ’d be worth more to PRP alive , but even a dead NN MD bring PRP a million for a squeeze of DT trigger . And how MD PRP capture CD ? PRP MD n’t , is all . Shoot PRP , is DT best way . PRP ’d have a million . I MD n’t even come to work tomorrow if I shot CD tonight . I ’d just sit back and start counting my money . ” Sections of County Ordinance 69 - 01 Skamania County , Washington ( located just across DT river from DT Dalles ) : “ Prohibiting wanton slaying of apecreatures and imposing penalties . “ WHEREAS , EX is evidence to indicate DT possible existence in Skamania County of a nocturnal primate mammal variously described as an apelike creature or a sub-species of homo sapiens , and “ WHEREAS , both legend and purported recent sightings and spoor support DT possibility , and “ WHEREAS , this creature is generally and commonly known as ‘ Sasquatch , ’ or ‘ Yeti ’ or ‘ Giant Hairy Ape , ’ and “ WHEREAS , publicity attendant on such real or imagined sightings has resulted in an influx of scientific investigators as well as casual hunters , JJ armed with lethal weapons , “ THEREFORE , let PRP be resolved IN any premeditated , willful and wanton slaying of any such creature shall be deemed a felony punishable by a fine not to exceed ten thousand dollars and / or imprisonment in DT county jail for a period not to exceed five NNS . ” This ordinance was adopted in DT spring of 1969 . On DT first day of April to be exact . Excerpt from a conversation with DT Dalles deputy Rich Carlson : “ EX are always fellows who VBP out to shoot PRP . EX are NNS who VBD PRP MD shoot PRP if PRP saw PRP . In DT beginning , CD sighting PRP had , DT townspeople found out about PRP , and by jiminy , PRP went up RB with rifles , ready to hunt PRP down …. ” Undoubtedly EX have been JJ hoaxes in DT Bigfoot saga . In 1968 a Mr. Ray Pickens of Colville , Washington , strapped a pair of 16 ″ , foot - IN plywood boards to his feet and tromped over DT nearby woods . A small crowd gathered and a photo was sent to Peter Byrne , who dismissed DT tracks as obvious fakes . Pickens later admitted DT hoax . John Napier VBZ in his book : “ I have in my files photographs of a further set of tracks which were clearly made by a hinged wooden contraption which MD n’t fool DT village idiot . ” Another citizen of Colville , DT Bigfoot hunter Ivan Marx , made a series of phone calls CD night in October of 1970 . He was in a NN of high excitement . A wounded Bigfoot had been sighted near Colville , and in DT morning he was VBG to VB out after PRP with his camera . As might be expected , a crowd gathered and Marx stayed in radio contact with them . At CD point he claimed to have sighted DT beast and some minutes later VBD he was actually filming PRP . Peter Byrne VBD Marx offered to sell DT film to Byrne ’s organization for $ 25,000 . He agreed to buy on DT condition IN DT film MD be studied first for signs of a hoax . Byrne says his NN showed IN DT film had been shot about a month previous to DT date Marx claimed and IN PRP had been shot in an entirely different area than DT claimed by Marx . Armed with this information , Byrne , DT sheriff , and some concerned citizens made a visit to Marx ’ Colville home . Marx was gone and EX was no forwarding address . He resurfaced a few weeks ago on DT television show PRP Asked for PRP . He had shot a film , he VBD , of a large Bigfoot in a snowstorm and had come to PRP Asked for PRP , because he was impressed by DT show ’s reputation . To my layman ’s eyes , DT film seems an incredibly clumsy fake . Peter Byrne VBD PRP was “ ridiculous . ” In PRP , DT creature is seen white in a heavy snowfall . PRP walks manlike , toward DT camera , jumps around aimlessly , and gives PRP a view of his front and back sides . DT white gorilla suit bags and wrinkles in DT ass . Most of DT known hoaxers seem to be motivated by money , by a desire for notoriety , and by DT desire to put CD over on everybody , especially DT bright boys , DT NNS . Journalists , as everyone knows , are beyond these considerations . Through perseverance and knowledge of human nature , I personally obtained an exclusive interview with Bigfoot . I had put notes up in DT local supermarkets and laundromats asking anyone with Bigfoot information to call me at DT Oregon Motel in DT Dalles . About CD AM on a dark and stormy night , I received a call . A hoarse voice with a heavy accent I MD n’t identify asked me if I was DT writer who wanted to talk to Bigfoot . I VBD I was . DT voice VBD , “ I am Omah . ” He stretched PRP out , “ Ohhhh - mahhhh . ” He VBD he MD meet me in 20 minutes at DT local Denny ’s 24 - hour coffee shop . He VBD I MD recognize him because he MD wear an ankle - length trench coat and a slouch hat , and because he MD be nine feet tall . I suggested he carry a basketball so as not to attract attention . I dressed quickly and doused my face with cold NN . DT restaurant was CD of those bits of roadside formica with zippy muzak and menopausal waitresses on mother goose shoes . Two truckdrivers discussed Peterbilt rigs near DT door . Omah sat in DT rear , hunched over a cup of coffee , DT hat pulled low over his forehead . He looked up quickly , almost angrily as I approached DT table . “ So why did PRP call me ? ” I asked . He wanted to VB if I had done any interviews and what my approach to DT story was VBG to be . I VBD IN I saw him as a survivor , a self - reliant primitive in DT midst of vast technocracy ; a pleasant reminder IN PRP have n’t yet swallowed up all our wilderness . I VBD IN I saw him as man ’s closest brother on DT NN and IN by knowing him , PRP MD certainly learn to VB ourselves DT better . Omah nodded absent - mindedly while I spoke . He called DT waitress over and ordered five Lumberjack Breakfasts : “ A stack of delicious buckwheat cakes with rich creamery butter and Vermont maple syrup , mounds of hash browns , a giant slab of Canadian bacon , golden brown toast and an assortment of DT finest jams ; a breakfast fit for a lumberjack . ” While he ate , I pumped him with questions . He had been coming down to DT Dalles from Fort Hood every spring for NNS to raid DT apple orchard WDT is now DT Pinewood Mobile Manor . CD fateful June , five NNS ago , he found DT orchard gone . In his confusion , he had come on DT Dalles Drive - in , which at DT NN was playing NNP of DT Apes . He watched DT film three times every night for two weeks . He learned to speak English . And an unshakable idea grew in his mind . Through DT long , snowy winters on Mt. Hood he considered . Every spring when he came down to DT Dalles , EX was a JJ ape sequel film . This NN he was ready to act . Suddenly he pulled DT hat back from his forehead and turned his profile to me . DT features were humanoid , but DT nose was flattened and DT eyes were flat black coals . “ What do PRP VB ? ” he blurted . “ About me , Omah … Do PRP VB I MD VB a part in DT next ape film ? ” He must have seen DT look on my face because he stopped talking and stared moodily at his Lumberjack Specials . Mentally I scrapped my survivor story . A great , inexplicable wave of sadness washed over me . PRP sat in silence for several minutes . “ Been swell talking to PRP , ” I VBD , and faked an expansive yawn . “ Well , I better VB back to DT motel . ” He looked up and for DT first NN his humanoid face showed emotion . PRP seemed twisted into an expression of hopeless pleading . “ I need DT ink , ” he began , then changed his tack . “ Hollywood must VB … ” I stood up , ready to leave . His lower lip quivered and for a terrible moment I thought he might begin to cry . PRP paid DT bill and he followed me out DT door where PRP stood for several minutes in DT black and windswept Oregon night . He continued to jabber about ape films in his strange accent . “ OK , sure , ” he VBD . EX was a distant bitterness in his voice . “ Ciao . ”"

Well , according to NNS and surveys , lots . Pleasingly , DT results show positives for all shapes and sizes . So whether PRP 're a child 's size 12 , a literal bigfoot or somewhere in between , here 's what DT experts have to say : In 2009 , a team of Swedish epidemiologists conducted a NN into DT relationship between shoe size and length of life , even releasing a helpful table to frighten NNS . DT results generally showed IN men with average - sized feet have DT best chances , while those at either extreme MD find themselves heading for an early grave . Despite DT , PRP did accept a margin of error . “ PRP have no doubt NNS can live longer than their shoe size MD indicate , ” PRP reassured PRP in DT research paper . “ But this MD be true only if PRP adopt an unusually NN - oriented lifestyle , with careful attention to diet and exercise . ” Below are their findings ; do n't say PRP did n't warn PRP : Small - hoofed men breathe a sigh of relief : EX is no truth to reports IN men with big feet have a large manhood , and countless studies dispelled DT myth . CD , conducted by University College London , involved 104 men and measured penises both when soft and "" gently stretched "" . PRP concluded DT assumed relationship was "" a common misconception "" . Research in Turkey in 2011 , however , was less certain . PRP found a vague correlation between height , weight , BMI ( body mass index ) and penis size , but not enough evidence to suggest feet alone can determine PRP . Instead , PRP MD be your fingers WDT give away your secrets . South Korean academics last NN published a NN suggesting men whose index fingers are shorter than their ring fingers are likely to have longer penises . Now PRP 're looking at your hands , are n't PRP ? PRP says whether PRP 're a love cheat DT cliché MD have been debunked , but EX does seem to be some link between shoe size and sex : those with bigger feet are more likely to be adulterous . According to a poll conducted by Illicit Encounters , DT UK 's largest dating website for NNS looking for affairs , DT most faithful foot sizes are between 7 and 9 , while those wearing 10s ( and above ) are three times more likely to cheat . PRP wo n't come as a surprise to learn IN height and foot size are related – after all , DT largest feet in Britain belong to a 6ft 8in rugby player – but EX is little evidence to say IN PRP 's a direct correlation . What big feet can predict , however , is an imminent growth spurt in teenagers . "" During puberty , DT hands and feet enlarge before DT long bones , "" VBZ DT Harvard NNP School . "" So for JJ , CD of DT first indicators WDT rapid growth is about to begin is an increase in shoe size . "" ... but only if DT length is in your toes . Relatively long toes compared to DT rest of your foot puts a spring in your step when PRP comes to running fast . "" Sprinters have a stronger , more elastic push off with DT toes . And long toes make DT overall length of DT foot bigger , which means longer contact with DT ground , which is where DT acceleration happens , "" David Houlihan - Burne , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon VBD . For reference , Usain Bolt has size 13 feet : big even for his 6ft 5 in frame . DT 6ft 1in Justin Gatlin , meanwhile , wears size 12 running spikes , but Tyson Gay ? Just a 9 .

"" A young Air Service lieutenant with DT name of Rickenbacker twists and turns his Spad pursuit airplane in mortal aerial combat with DT "" Hun "" at 10,000 feet . U.S. Navy warships plow through high seas to protect a convoy of transports traveling slowly across DT stormy Atlantic from DT deadly German U - boats . These scenes of NNP War I action , and thousands more IN them , exist today on silent black - and - white motion picture film . Contrary to some widely held beliefs , large , heavy , wooden boxes with crude brass - encased glass lenses , metal hand cranks , and ungainly tripods were , indeed , filming DT events of DT Great War . In fact , millions of feet of 35 mm film were exposed by all DT major combatants . Unfortunately , only a relatively small percentage of DT original footage can be found in DT NN today . Film decay and arbitrary disposal are factors linked to its rarity . For America , these films were shot on location , as history happened , by dedicated and courageous U.S. Army Signal Corps soldier - cameramen . DT films WDT found their way back with DT U.S. Army , along with a few from Britain , France , Italy , Canada , and Germany , are considered official records of DT U.S. NNP and are preserved at DT National Archives and Records Administration ( NARA ) as part of what is CD of DT NN 's largest film collections , with holdings of more than 360,000 reels of film . Most , but not all , of DT NNP War I titles are cataloged as part of DT Records of DT Office of DT Chief Signal Officer , Record Group ( RG ) 111 , located at DT National Archives at College Park , Maryland . Ever wonder how these historic films found their way to DT NARA ? This is a short story about DT origins and disposition of these classic war pictures and DT available finding aids for those interested in DT era . Three months after DT NNP NNPS declared war in April 1917 , DT U.S. Army Signal Corps was designated as DT agency responsible for obtaining photographic coverage of America 's participation in DT war . DT stated purpose of still and motion - picture film documentation was for use in propaganda and in scientific and military reconnaissance , but PRP was principally for DT production of a pictorial history of DT conflict . During July 1917 , DT Photographic Section was established within DT Signal Corps to provide and control all photographic activities within DT Army . In an effort to VB DT unit up and running as swiftly as possible , a photographic officer accompanied Gen. John J. "" Black Jack "" Pershing to Europe in order to VB DT methods and equipment of DT photographic departments of DT Allied armies . By DT end of DT month , a laboratory was secured in Paris , France , for developing and printing both motion and still pictures . This laboratory served until February 1918 , when photographic operations were transferred to a larger location in Vincennes . Starting with 25 men , DT Photographic Section attached to DT American Expeditionary Force ( AEF ) grew in strength to 92 officers and 498 enlisted men by DT NN of DT Armistice in November 1918 . An operational photographic unit consisted of CD motion - picture cameraman and CD still - picture photographer , with an appropriate number of assistants . CD photographic unit was assigned to each of DT American Army divisions as well as to other units attached to higher Army headquarters , special services , and JJ welfare organizations IN DT Red Cross and DT Salvation Army . Overall , AEF Signal Corps cameramen shot roughly 590,000 feet of film , while motion picture units located in DT NNP NNPS filmed about 280,000 feet of domestic scenes . A fairly complicated system was developed by DT Photographic Section in order to ensure accurate identification of DT film shot . Each cameraman was assigned a group of consecutive scene numbers . These numbers were perforated in DT leader film of each scene as PRP was developed at DT laboratory in Paris . At DT same NN , an index file was set up containing DT scene identification number and description furnished by DT cameraman . Laboratory personnel arranged DT scenes supplied by DT cameramen into 1,099 subjects ( collectively called DT AEF series ) in chronological order , fully edited and captioned , and shipped them to DT War Plans Division at DT Army War College in Carlisle , Pennsylvania . At DT War College DT captions were verified , and a detailed subject index was prepared . A similar procedure was used with DT footage taken in DT NNP NNPS , except IN these films were placed into DT "" Miscellaneous "" and "" Domestic "" series . During 1936 and 1937 DT AEF , Miscellaneous , and Domestic series films were culled and re-edited by DT Army to combine them into a single subject basis series . DT result was DT "" Historical "" series of films with catalog numbers between H - 1100 and H -1558 . At DT same NN , a JJ series of "" Miscellaneous "" films was established WDT contained DT photographic histories of DT numerous AEF divisions , special films IN "" Flashes of Action , "" and other subjects WDT did not properly fit into DT Historical series . Soon after DT National Archives was established in 1934 , federal agencies were directed to deposit their archival records RB . DT Army complied . As a result , DT newly re-edited Historical and Miscellaneous films were transferred to DT motion picture holdings of DT National Archives . Today , these celluloid - based moving images are divided into almost 500 titles , contained on about 1,000 large film reels , and consist of tens of thousands of individual scenes . To facilitate DT use of these films by NNP War I historians , researchers , documentary producers , and DT general NN , a landmark finding aid was compiled by a young National Archives archivist named K. Jack Bauer . His work was titled Special List Number 14 : List of NNP War I Signal Corps Films ( Record Group [ RG ] 111 ) . DT National Archives and Records Service , as PRP was known then , published PRP in 1957 . This 68 - page , 8 - by - 10 inch format , green - covered booklet became DT principal guide for RG 111 , and PRP has remained so for more than 50 NNS . PRP is still recommended by NARA staff for those interested in this NN period and is RB cited in DT 2,428 - page , three - volume , comprehensive Guide to Federal Records in DT National Archives of DT NNP NNPS ( 1995 ) . Since DT List has been out of print for well over 45 NNS , copies of this publication are very difficult to find . I became familiar with DT List while doing research for my book War Wings : Films of DT First Air War and found PRP to be an outstanding starting point for my in - depth research . Detecting a sense of renewed interest in DT NNP War I NN period by historians , DT general NN , and Hollywood , PRP seemed appropriate to find a way to republish this superb research tool . However , as I began to work on DT project , I found myself adding more and more information to DT film descriptions based on DT original 1920s scripts and catalog cards prepared in connection with DT Army re-edit of DT films during 1936 and 1937 . Further onsite research at DT National Archives ultimately more than doubled DT numbers of pages of information and added 58 titles to DT project . Published in 2007 , Battlefilm : U.S. Army Signal Corps Motion Pictures of DT Great War was DT result . A small representative sampling of DT 467 NNP War I titles found within RG 111 include : • SECOND AVIATION INSTRUCTION CENTER ( TOURS ) Reel 1 : Panorama of training planes and hangars at Tours , France ; fuselage of a Nieuport is repaired ; cameras are mounted on a Sopwith plane ; flying cadets take pictures ; pilots train with mounted machine guns , fire on a range , and place panel signals .

EX ’s a lot to manage if PRP have diabetes : checking your blood sugar , making healthy food , finding NN to be active , taking medicines , VBG to doctor ’s appointments . With all DT , your feet might be DT last thing on your mind . But daily care is CD of DT best ways to prevent foot complications . About half of all NNS with diabetes have some kind of diabetic neuropathyexternal icon ( nerve damage ) . PRP can have nerve damage in any part of your body , but nerves in your feet and legs are most often affected . Nerve damage can cause PRP to lose feeling in your feet . Some NNS with nerve damage have numbness , tingling , or pain , but others have no symptoms . Nerve damage can RB lower your ability to feel pain , heat , or cold . Living without pain sounds pretty good , but PRP comes at a high cost . Pain is DT body ’s way of telling PRP something ’s wrong so PRP can take care of yourself . If PRP do n’t feel pain in your feet , PRP MD not notice a cut , blister , sore , or other problem . Small problems can become serious if PRP are n’t treated early . MD PRP Have Nerve Damage ? Anyone with diabetes can develop nerve damage , but these factors increase your risk : • Blood sugar levels WDT are hard to manage • Having diabetes for a long NN , especially if your blood sugar is often higher than your target levels Nerve damage , along with poor blood flow — another diabetes complication — puts PRP at risk for developing a foot ulcer ( a sore or wound ) WDT MD VB infected and not heal well . If an infection does n’t VB better with treatment , your toe , foot , or part of your leg MD need to be amputated ( removed by surgery ) to prevent DT infection from spreading and to save your life . When PRP check your feet every day , PRP can catch problems early and VB them treated right away . Early treatment greatly reduces your risk of amputation . Check your feet every day for cuts , redness , swelling , sores , blisters , corns , calluses , or any other NN to DT skin or nails . Use a mirror if PRP ca n’t see DT bottom of your feet , or ask a family member to help . Wash your feet every day in warm ( not hot ) NN . Do n’t soak your feet . Dry your feet completely and apply lotion to DT top and bottom — but not between your toes , which MD lead to infection . Never VB barefoot . Always wear shoes and socks or slippers , even inside , to avoid injury . Check IN EX are n’t any pebbles or other objects inside your shoes and IN DT lining is smooth . Wear shoes WDT fit well . For DT best fit , try on JJ shoes at DT end of DT day when your feet tend to be largest . Break in your JJ shoes slowly — wear them for an hour or two a day at first until PRP ’re completely comfortable . Always wear socks with your shoes . Trim your toenails straight across and gently smooth any sharp edges with a nail file . Have your foot doctor ( podiatrist ) trim your toenails if PRP ca n’t see or reach your feet . Do n’t remove corns or calluses yourself , and especially do n’t use over - DT - counter products to remove them — PRP MD burn your skin . VB your feet checked at every NN care visit . RB , visit your foot doctor every NN ( more often if PRP have nerve damage ) for a complete exam , which will include checking for feeling and blood flow in your feet . Keep DT blood flowing . Put your feet up when PRP ’re sitting , and wiggle your toes for a few minutes several times throughout DT day . Choose feet - friendly activities IN walking , riding a bike , or swimming . Check with your doctor about which activities are best for PRP and any PRP should avoid . Be sure to ask your doctor what else PRP can do to keep your feet healthy . When to See Your Doctor If PRP experience any of these symptoms , do n’t wait for your next appointment . See your regular doctor or foot doctor right away : • Pain in your legs or cramping in your buttocks , thighs , or calves during physical activity . • Tingling , burning , or pain in your feet . • Loss of sense of touch or ability to feel heat or cold very well . • A NN in DT shape of your feet over NN . • Loss of hair on your toes , feet , and lower legs . • A NN in DT color and temperature of your feet . • Fungus infections such as athlete ’s foot between your toes . Most NNS with diabetes can prevent serious foot complications . Regular care at home and VBG to all doctor ’s appointments are your best bet for preventing foot problems ( and stopping small problems from becoming serious ones ) ."

However unlike Bee , Barr has paid an extremely steep price , losing her highly acclaimed sitcom show “ Roseanne ” on ABC , which generated DT highest rating in history for a rebooted TV sitcom . While “ C - List ” comedian Bee was being celebrated for making a similar vile remark by big - name celebrities , against a backdrop of declining ratings and a mass exit of over a dozen sponsors dropping out of her late - night “ Full Frontal ” show on TBS , which continues to support her Barr ’s tweets were mostly in response to DT thousands of loyal fans fed - up with DT blatant “ double - standards ” and DT “ hypocrisy ” exhibited by DT left . DT award - winning comedian is thinking about fighting DT show ’s cancellation posting ; ‘ I ’m not a racist , I never was & I never will be . CD stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities , against networks , studios , at DT expense of my nervous system / family / wealth will NEVER b taken from me . ” Barr continued , “ PRP guys make me feel IN fighting back . I will examine all of my options carefully and VB back to U . ” Moreover , DT remarkable contrast between Bee and Barr was never more evident than within their respective apologies . Barr ’s apology after she realized she had stepped in PRP ; “ Guys I did something unforgivable so do not defend me . PRP was 2 in DT morning and I was Ambien tweeting - PRP was memorial day too - i went 2 far & do not VB PRP defended - PRP was egregious Indefensible , ” Now contrast DT with Bees ’ apology , “ PRP VBP a lot of NNS were offended and angry IN I used an epithet to describe DT NNP ’s daughter and advisor last week . PRP is a word I have used on DT show JJ times , hoping to reclaim PRP , this NN I used PRP as an insult . I crossed DT line . I regret PRP and I do apologize for DT . ” Adding , “ I VBP this show to be challenging and I VBP PRP to be honest , I never intended PRP to hurt anyone , except Ted Cruz . JJ men were RB offended by my use of DT word … I do not care about DT . I hate IN this distracted from more important issues . ” Quite a contrast indeed and JJ of Barr ’s fans are finally speaking out . Among DT tweets WDT Barr reposted to her account was CD from DT Twitter user @poconomtn who wrote : “ I ’m confused . Roseanne ’s show was a family show . Her actions place outside of her show . Joy Behar & Jimmy Kimmel do PRP ON their shows which reflects badly on your network yet PRP keep them . Do n’t pretend this is n’t political . ” Another twitter follower posted ; “ Normal Americans are watching in absolute shock as leftist maniacs indulge in yet another political sacrifice . PRP wo n’t end well for PRP guys . ” And still another ; “ In DT past 24 hours , Roseanne has attacked DT legitimacy of DT NN , shared Tommy Robinson ’s story , and mentioned George Soros and now she is being slandered as an evil racist ( # 1 top trending ) . This is an obvious smear job for challenging DT authority of DT NN . ” Kyle Morris another Twitter user asked perhaps DT most profound question directed at ABC , DT network WDT fired Barr , asking ; “ Why ABC did n’t terminate Joy Behar ’s contract when she VBD NNS who VBP PRP can talk to Jesus are “ mentally ill ” ? No doubt Barr ’s outspoken support of NNP NNP , along with her unconventional hit show poking fun at DT progressive establishment is certainly DT reason why a majority of Barr ’s fans believe DT was DT real reason for DT shows cancellation . DT timely remark concerning Jarrett simply helped ABC hide behind PRP , and claim DT network MD n’t tolerate such hateful speech … however “ PRP VBP better . ”"

PRP develop to protect skin from damage against prolonged rubbing , pressure , and other forms of irritation . Calluses and corns usually form on DT hands or feet . Callus . A callus is a thickening of skin exposed to prolonged rubbing . DT thickening is evenly distributed . On DT hands , a callus MD form on a finger due to repeated pressure or rubbing from a pen or pencil , or from playing a stringed instrument . Calluses can RB form at DT base of DT fingers from using gardening tools , playing tennis , chopping wood , or any activity in which PRP tightly grasp an object . On DT feet , calluses typically develop near DT base of DT toes , where PRP are caused by friction from DT inside of shoes . Some calluses are related to walking problems or foot abnormalities WDT place unusual stress on parts of DT foot during walking . Corns . A corn is a protective thickening of DT skin on DT top of DT foot , usually on a bony , knobby portion of a toe . Corns often develop because of irritation caused by tight shoes . At DT center of a corn is often a dense knot of skin called a core , which is located over DT area of greatest friction or pressure . Firm , dry corns WDT form on DT upper surfaces of DT toes are called hard corns . Pliable , moist corns WDT form between DT toes are called soft corns . A callus is a yellowish , flat , hard layer of dead skin . PRP can cause : A corn is RB a layer of dead skin , usually around DT toes . PRP MD have a dense knot of skin in DT center of DT hardened area . IN calluses , corns can cause : After prolonged irritation , a brown , red , or black discoloration MD develop under a large corn or callus . This is caused by a small amount of bleeding in DT space between thick and normal skin . In severe NNS , DT thick and normal skin MD separate , exposing DT area to possible infection . Simple inspection of DT hands or feet is often enough to diagnose a callus or corn . Your doctor MD ask about your shoes , because shoes with narrow toes are more likely to cause corns . He or she RB will ask about DT NN of your feet and your history of other JJ problems , including diabetes and circulation problems . Some types of foot problems can VB DT mechanics of DT foot , causing abnormal pressure on certain areas and leading to calluses . Any previous surgery or trauma to DT feet MD RB affect DT structure and alignment of foot bones , increasing DT chance of developing a callus or corn . To find out whether your corns and calluses are related to foot abnormalities , your doctor will inspect your feet for : • problems related to an abnormal way of walking ( gait ) Calluses and corns need treatment by a doctor or other clinician only if PRP cause pain or other problems . Self - help treatments include : • wearing gloves or other protection when gardening , playing racquet sports , or doing other activities WDT put pressure on your hands . • wearing shoes WDT fit well , with plenty of room around DT toes ( wide and deep toe boxes ) . This reduces DT irritation WDT caused DT problem in DT first place . Over NN , DT corns or calluses will shrink on their own . This process often weeks or months . • cushioning DT affected area with moleskin to relieve pressure . PRP can RB make a "" donut "" with moleskin , lamb 's wool , felt , or foam . JJ pharmacies sell over - DT - counter products to cushion corns and calluses . If a callus or corn gets in DT way of activity , or causes pain , EX are two main ways to shrink or reduce PRP : • Soak DT affected hand or foot in warm NN to soften DT callus or corn . Dry DT area . Then rub a pumice stone gently over DT callus or corn . Afterward , moisturize DT area with skin lotion . Repeat every day or every few days as needed . • Use an over - DT - counter liquid or ointment WDT contains salicylic acid to soften DT callus or corn . Then rub PRP with a pumice stone to lightly scrape away DT dead skin . Be careful with salicylic acid , and follow DT instructions exactly , since PRP can harm surrounding healthy skin . Some foot care specialists advise against using these products at all . PRP MD be wise to see a food specialist ( podiatrist ) if a callus or corn makes PRP hard to walk or do other activities . DT doctor MD find a structural problem with your feet , or find IN PRP place unusual stress on parts of your foot while walking . If DT 's DT case , he or she MD suggest special padding or shoe inserts . Shoe inserts redistribute DT forces WDT cause friction and pressure inside your shoes , relieving some of DT stress on your feet when PRP walk . If your corn or callus is painful , your doctor MD shave away some of DT thickened skin to relieve pain and pressure in DT affected area . In rare NNS , surgery to correct an underlying problem of bone structure MD be needed to treat a corn or callus WDT keeps returning and is not relieved by padding , shoe inserts , and periodic shaving .

Semans , co-executive director of DT national Native American voting rights organization Four Directions . Nine presidential hopefuls , Sens. Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar , former U.S. secretary of housing and urban development Julian Castro , former Maryland Rep. John Delaney , NNP York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , Montana Gov. , Democrat Steve Bullock , Navajo pastor Mark Charles and author Marianne Williamson say PRP will participate in DT Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum . DT two - day event opens Monday in Sioux City , Iowa . Organizers say invitations were extended to candidates from all major political parties , although so far only these nine candidates hoping to unseat NNP Donald NNP in DT 2020 election have confirmed their attendance . DT organizers RB say talks are continuing with several other campaigns . Mark Trahant , a member of DT Shoshone - Bannock Tribe and editor of Indian Country Today , will moderate a series of panels , giving tribal leaders and Native American youth a chance to air concerns and ask candidates questions on matters of particular importance to Native voters . Semans expressed delight IN JJ major NN organizations will be covering DT event . "" For two days , all of DT NNP NNPS is VBG to VB PRP ’re here , ” Semans VBD . “ PRP did n’t VB wiped out , PRP are not extinct , and PRP have a political voice in which issues WDT until now have been set on DT back burner are now VBG to be able to be discussed . "" Of DT hundreds of issues of importance to Native American voters , panelists will focus on two in particular , VBD Semans : DT Remove DT Stain Act , which Washington Rep. Denny Heck introduced in DT House in June as H.R. 3467 . If enacted , DT bill MD rescind DT 20 Medals of Honor awarded to members of DT 7th Cavalry who on December 29 , 1890 , murdered nearly 150 Lakota in DT Wounded Knee Massacre . DT Medal of Honor is America ’s highest military honor , given out to members of DT armed services who demonstrate outstanding bravery and valor . “ Our second priority issue for DT forum is missing and murdered indigenous women and NNS , ” VBD Semans . “ Women and NNS are sacred to our societies , and in order for PRP to maintain our societies and cultures , PRP must do what PRP were taught , which is to protect women and NNS , who PRP are losing in outrageous numbers . ” According to DT U.S. Justice Department , Native women are 10 times as likely to be murdered as DT national average , falling victim to domestic or drug - related violence , sexual assault or sex trafficking . DT National Indigenous Women ’s Resource Center has called on lawmakers to expand tribal jurisdiction over NNS of missing and murdered women and NNS ; allocate more resources for victim services ; improve data collection and expand tribal access to federal criminal databases , among other measures . “ Actually , underfunding is DT fundamental to all these issues , ” VBD Semans . “ PRP MD n’t have to be discussing funding for our transportation or infrastructure , PRP MD n’t have to have discussions on housing and NN care and law enforcement if DT federal NN fully honored DT treaties . ” In a related development , Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced Friday she will work with NNP Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland ( Pueblo of Laguna ) on legislative proposals addressing chronic federal underfunding of tribes , as well as barriers to tribal sovereignty . DT last NN Native Americans had a chance to speak directly to presidential candidates was in August 2007 at DT “ Prez on DT Rez ” forum on DT Morongo Reservation in California . Only three candidates , all Democrats for DT 2008 race , participated . Then - NNP Mexico Governor Bill Richardson , former Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel took part .

Since Roswell PRP has taken a JJ sinister turn WDT defies imagination . by Preston James , Ph.D on November 21 , 2016 Note : This article is written for professional Intel and those who understand DT Secret Space War program , DT back engineering of recovered Alien ET technologies , and technologies obtained by treaties and exchange programs . Because VT is committed to open source Intel and believes IN DT NN has a right to VB how their taxpayer funds are being spent , especially when used to wage a secret war to hijack their mind , this information is being made available to anyone who is interested with no limitations . If PRP are not up to speed on this background reading , this article will probably be a waste of your NN . EX has been significant intercept actions to prevent this article from ever being published . PRP was suggested to me IN I MD not be able to ever complete this article or be allowed to publish PRP , but here PRP is . I must extend a big thank PRP to DT Editors of VT who have allowed this article to be published and who are deeply committed to open source Intel , making such available to all who are interested in DT truth even when PRP is hard to fathom . DT current NN of mind - kontrol is probably far beyond anything PRP have ever imagined possible . Mass Mind - kontrol — PRP ’s been VBG on since DT NN of Nimrod and ancient Babylonia . And PRP ’s sinister and evil beyond words and description . Since Roswell PRP has taken a JJ sinister turn WDT defies imagination . PRP ’s what empowers DT evil Cabal WDT has hijacked DT USG and JJ of DT governments of DT NN . Some insiders claim PRP is not of human origin . Cultural and educational methodologies typically have included coordinated efforts to instill certain values , beliefs and attitudes into DT societal mass group mind , both conscious and subconscious . for controlling DT American Mass Mind for purposes of social control and simulated beliefs and increased sales were readily adopted by Madison Avenue advertising agencies and elements of DT USG . Bernays - type methodologies predetermined values , beliefs and attitudes in members of society WDT caused them to carry certain beliefs and mindsets which predispose them to act in ways WDT are beneficial to DT ruling oligarchical class . PRP is DT oligarchical class – folks who consider themselves “ elite bloodline individuals chosen to rule over DT masses ” – who make certain IN DT educational and religious systems are instilled in this desired group mind set . No real academic freedom exists in American Universities , so do n’t expect NNS to help PRP figure out how your mind is being attacked psychotronically . Despite DT illusion of academic freedom in America ’s universities , EX is none . No classes are ever taught on how DT Federal Reserve System is illegal and unconstitutional and how PRP charges PRP pernicious usury to use what should have been our own money in DT first place . Or IN DT FRS stole all DT NNP Gold and now replaced real NNP Dollars with paper debt notes backed by nothing but requiring repayment . Nor does any American University teach IN 9-11 - 01 was a false - flag attack done by DT JCS , USAF , NORAD , and DT FAA using PNACers , top NeoCons , and Mossad . Doubt this statement IN EX is no academic freedom in academia in America ? Just ask CD of VT ’s own Editors Dr. Kevin Barrett , or Professor James Tracy , both of whom were illegally and unconstitutionally fired by RKM educational policies adopted by DT dupes in charge of faculty . Nor does any American University teach or allow any classes regarding Sandy Hook having been a two - day DHS / FEMA Capstone drill where nobody at all died , or IN Adam Lanza never existed , but was a fake construct . JJ and private education is designed and deployed to lead PRP DT NNS away from truth and to instill values , beliefs and attitudes WDT make PRP easier for DT Satanic Pedophile Network ( Ruling Cabal ) to maintain rule over PRP , keep PRP their secret serfs , and asset strip PRP blind , until America DT Republic is destroyed from within . DT Major Mass NNP NNP Cartel is still lying in lockstep about DT JFK Assassination . If PRP doubt DT ability of DT RKM ’s Crime Cabal , which runs DT USG , to control DT Major Mass NN to keep DT American Mass Mind filled with blatant lies , just consider how , over 50 NNS later , all DT Major Mass NNP Broadcast NN are still claiming IN Oswald assassinated JFK and was a “ lone - nut ” assassin . Of course , surveys now show IN 60 - 80 % of DT American NNS do not believe this at all , and instead JJ believe IN DT CIA , using Op40 , did PRP and PRP was a major America Coup d’Etat involving GHWB , LBJ , J. Edgar Hoover , General Landsdale , General Lemnitzer , Allan Dulles and JJ more . When PRP create and control all DT money PRP VBP , PRP can buy almost anyone and everyone , and promote those PRP VBP to DT highest positions of power . DT Ruling Cabal controls DT creation and distribution of money and can create all DT power PRP need to implement their policies , which are designed to move mankind along a Globalist path leading to their long - desired Satanic NWO System . Dark - side Psi-power is harnessed for evil by DT ruling Cabal , which is Satanic and deeply committed to an inhuman , anti-human Globalist NWO Agenda WDT requires 90 % depopulation . Psi -power manipulations of DT mass group mind is DT little known but real practice of DT spiritually based mind - control of DT masses through DT application of specific Black Arts to “ manipulate , fracture and even eventually snatch DT human soul ” and replace PRP with non-human spiritual entities from DT dark side . Dark - side Psi-power is DT technology used in trauma based mind - kontrol , and DT means by which psychopaths and narcissists are inducted into DT worldwide Satanic pedophile network in incrementally criminal , anti-human Satanic rituals of abuse , rape , torture and even sacrifice of captive innocent NNS to gain more and more evil Satanic psi-power . Some insiders have reported IN top cult members receive their own personal “ spirit guide ” as a consigliere , which periodically appears to them in private and “ advises ” them after PRP reach DT level of child torture and child sacrifice . Some have claimed these are “ Fallen Ones / Lesser Gods ” ; others claim PRP are very evil , deceptive and crafty demons or Djinns . EX is DT reverse side to Dark - sided Psi-power , which is a spiritual entity . In basic form , PRP is DT spontaneously emerging JJ populism , which is a direct offshoot of DT Internet which is turning out to be DT NNP Gutenberg Press . Some conservative Christians claim PRP can muster positive Psi-power directly from God Almighty through prayer and faith , and this is reflected in a JJ and strong desire to do what is right and moral , to serve others , to resist and stop evil and to treat others DT way CD desires to be treated . I have covered evil psi-power emanating from DT ancient Babylonian Talmudic Black arts in prior articles and will VB more specific in future articles . But PRP is so esoteric IN PRP MD pose a distraction from DT main thrust of this article , which is DT JJ ultra high tech remote mind war WDT is now being waged against your brain on JJ fronts , depending on where PRP reside . EX is a secret alliance between Intel and DT Ruling Satanic Pedophile Cabal WDT specializes in Black Arts for Mind War against PRP DT NNPS , Colonel Michael Aquino Style . Col . Michael Aquino , Army Psychological Operations expert and father of DT Temple of Set and DT entity which brought Satanism as an accepted religion into DT NNP Army , as well as alleged to have run DT pedophile operations at DT Presidio in California and at Offutt AF Base in Omaha . CD insider alleged IN Col. Aquino was actually promoted to General of DT NSA and still is active . PRP is now a well established fact IN JJ of DT NN ’s Intel agencies have formed a secret alliance with DT worldwide Satanic pedophile network ( an oligarchical cult ) and has used DT trauma - based mind - kontrol conditioning to create MPD / DID sleepers , agents and secret servants in every walk of life , every occupation and even within DT Secret Service . In fact DT Satanic Pedophile Cult Network ( Ruling Cabal ) inside America has been deputized as an agent of American national Security , and is used by America Intel as cover for numerous Mind - Kontrol experiments and deep black covert operations . American Law Enforcement is fully compromised by DT Satanic Pedophile Network ( Ruling Cabal ) . Every major police department in America as well a every FBI office including DT WFO has a sheep - dipped individual who runs interference for DT Satanic Pedophile Cabal WDT rules America . Whenever DT phrase “ VBG black ” , deep black , or “ black operations ” is used PRP can be certain IN PRP always is anti-human , evil , based on ancient Babylonian Black Arts of deception , casuistry , equivocation , and sophistry designed to undermine human character and DT natural will of DT masses . DT documentation of MK - Ultra and other CIA mind - kontrol programs is so well established and now so JJ from declassified docs and vetted personal testimonies in front of Congressional Committees , IN PRP is worthless to try and deny DT existence of such programs . Every large city prosecutor knows PRP MD be unwise to attempt to prosecute any of DT Satanic crimes linked to DT Satanic pedophile Network or any Satanic cult crimes or Satanic Ritual Abuse WDT MD create any JJ cognizance of this issue . And be certain of this , these MK - Ultra programs which were supposed to have been discontinued after DT Church Commission , actually went Black ( completely covert inside American Intel inside privatized defense contractors deputized under national security ) and are still very active today and even expanding every NN . Back engineered Alien ET technologies have opened up Pandora ’s box . Back engineered Alien ET technologies have opened up Pandora ’s box of remote inductive brain entrainment making PRP possible for Deep Black Intel groups ( often buried deep within defense contractors or proprietaries in unacknowledged special access programs ) to deploy incredibly sophisticated JJ weapons of “ mindwar ” against DT American mass subconscious mind . Ever since crashed UFOs were recovered in 1922 in DT Black Forest and in Roswell NM in America in 1947 , recovered and back - engineered Alien ET technologies have been a major game changer . JJ Psychotronic Mindwar weapons have now been deployed in a secret assault on your brain to entrain PRP and in JJ NNS on your body to make PRP physically ill and to shorten your life . DT purpose is to help DT Satanic Pedophile Network ( Ruling Cabal ) attain their inter-generational , age old Globalist NWO Agenda of evil which has been their wetdream ever since ancient Babylon . As DT JJ quantum based physics have evolved into DT use of microwaves , pulsed beam microwaves , ELF and scalar ( standing waves ) , PRP was learned IN various sophisticated types of electric induction MD be used to remotely entrain DT brain to operate at certain desired frequencies . Voice of God Technology . And PRP was RB discovered IN voices and self - talk , as well as specific belief patterns , MD be entrained directly into DT brain remotely by use of sophisticated inductive methods , now referred to as advanced psychotronics . EX are numerous vetted and Rock solid reports of DT deployment of DT Voice of God remote inductive technology being deployed against DT Republican Guard in DT first Gulf War . This resulted in these Iraqi Soldiers hearing Allah ’s voice inside their heads instructing them to throw down their arms and surrender after which hundreds were bulldozed into ditches and buried alive to their deaths . This weapon system was then tabled not to be used again because DT Cabal was concerned PRP MD become too well known and DT MD lead to DT discovery of their other similar weapons which are now being deployed , weapons much more subtle WDT instill attitudes and beliefs but usually no direct voices . Some of DT JJ remote entrainment technologies operate by DT principal of inter-dimensional or quantum physics , WDT is immediate remote communication with a target through a medium of a different dimension where DT carrier is alleged to be timeless Dimension waves ( aka D - waves ) . PRP ’s a fact IN Mass Mind - kontrol has taken a turn for DT worse since Roswell . DT JJ technologies developed from back engineered recovered crashed Alien ET UFOs are so sophisticated and so anti-free will and anti-human IN unless taken Deep - Black and protected by numerous layers of “ need to VB ” , extreme compartmenting and special access unaccounted programs , DT NN MD rise up in mass and destroy those programs by whatever means necessary . Without abject beyond - Black secrecy these sinister Mind - kontrol programs utilizing advanced psychotronics deployed and managed in real NN by artificial intelligence , PRP MD never survive intact . Now for a presentation of current psychotronic weapons now being deployed against DT brains of JJ Americans in select cities and select regions , and some known countermeasures which have been claimed to be effective . Note : This section is long and those interested can pick and choose DT subjects PRP VBP . Some of these weapons such as ELF are deployed against a group of randomly selected citizens and a select group of federal and corporate whistleblowers . CD group is used as an innocent control and DT other as a group of targeted individuals who in some way are deemed a current or future threat to DT Satanic Pedophile Network ( Ruling Cabal ) . Do not VB discouraged and do not lose hope , help is now on DT way on several fronts and PRP can do JJ things to protect yourself and your loved ones . I have instituted these countermeasures in my home and DT homes of various friends and have been pleased with DT results , which are backed up by professional quality meters . As PRP read about these quite nasty psychotronic weapons now deployed against JJ of PRP Americans , please keep in mind IN without abject secrecy WDT is now being denied , these soulless entities who are doing this to PRP will eventually be stopped cold by DT JJ quite powerful spontaneously emerging populism which is now growing IN an out of control wildfire . Smartmeters and Dirty electricity : Activists claim IN Smartmeters ( PRP are digital instead of DT old analog ) are NOT UL rated IN DT old analog ones and IN these Smartmeters have caused unexpected house fires and EX are numerous complaints of much larger electric bills with DT same prior usage , numerous complaints about sleeping problems , headaches , nervousness , agitation and various strange illness emerging . In some localities PRP is a violation to install devise WDT are not UL rated so folks need to organize into action groups to expose this and stop their use as a JJ NN issue . This ignores DT secret mind - kontrol aspects of Smartmeters but to focus on DT issue is far too discrediting to ever VB anywhere . Few members of DT NN who are not trained Psyops experts can fathom this unless PRP have been “ targeted individuals ” and experienced significant symptoms firsthand . Smartmeters can allegedly be remotely “ turned up ” to emit large EMF pulsed beam microwave bursts ( numerous times per minute ) and have been alleged by experts to be able to emit significant or very large amounts of dirty electricity ( dirty harmonics ) in ones AC circuits . Counter measures include using grounded stainless steel screen or two thicknesses of grounded aluminum screen wrapped astound DT Smartmeter itself , and by hanging an EMF shield of special fabric or two thicknesses of grounded , hanging aluminum screen inside which adequately blocks DT inward NNS reaching your bedroom and living quarters . To be sure IN PRP have reduced DT EMF PRP will need to purchase an Microwave detector . EX are JJ good quality ones available for DT range of $ 80 to $ 400 which will cover Smartmeters ( ask DT seller which model will suffice ) . A certified EMF detector MD cost up to $ 2,000 and will tell DT difference between regular microwaves and pulsed beam microwaves and in what intensity in microwatts per square meter and a record of accumulation per NN period . Smartmeters have been found in some areas to generate large amounts of dirty electrical harmonics in DT AC circuits of PRP ’s home . DT gold standard for analysis of these AC dirty electricity harmonics is to analyze them with a properly connected AC oscilloscope , a fairly expensive piece of equipment . I have personally tested my AC circuits for dirty electricity using a Greenwave Dirty electricity meter and after finding very high levels , I then installed Greenwave Electrical Filters which have dual capacitors , are grounded , are UL rated and are RoHC compliant ( RoHS , RB known as Lead - Free , stands for Restriction of Hazardous Substances . RoHS , RB known as Directive 2002/95 / EC , originated in DT European Union and restricts DT use of six hazardous materials found in electrical and electronic products . I prefer DT Greenwave meter because PRP has an audio function WDT increases in volume with increased dirty electricity and a calculator WDT estimates DT percentage of decrease when PRP add a filter . EX is RB DT Stetzerizer meter and electrical filters available too which are RB popular . If PRP cannot afford to VB a dirty electrical indicator / meter , PRP can detect significant dirty electricity and Lilly Waves by turning on an AM radio and moving DT dial through DT channels . AM channels will be very buzzy or fuzzy and reception will be very poor . For those WDT cannot afford dirty electricity filters , PRP can move their bed a bout 3 feet from DT wall where DT AC wires are , or turn off DT breaker covering where PRP sleep at night . FM is not affected by dirty electricity . — Lilly Waves : In some locales these special behavior and NN altering wave forms ( a special type of dirty electricity harmonics ) are purposely generated by special outside mounted line boxes into your household AC circuits . DT purpose is to mind - kontrol PRP , make PRP ill , disturb your sleep , make PRP disturbed , cause relationship conflict with your significant other and break down DT family system . This is a deep - black incredibly sinister system WDT can be detected by dirty electrical meters ( Greenwave or Stetzerizer or by using an Osciliscop which is typically quite an expensive piece of equipment ) . If detected , these waves can be mitigated by DT adequate installation of Greenwave or Stetzerizer Filters . DT use of large line filters attached to your electrical supply work great but PRP start at about $ 5,000 and for most DT cost is prohibitive . Use of DT small AC filters which are between $ 25 and $ 35 each do an effective reducinfg Lilly waves and other forms of dirty electricity including DT from Smartmeters if installed correctly . — Remote phones : I have swept a number of homes for EMF using sophisticated accurate EMF meters of several varieties . I have found IN in those where DT occupants had serious complaints of sleeping issues , headaches , loss of NN or irritability , EMF levels were in DT range of up to 4,500 microwatts per square meter , high enough to cause behavioral and NN problems , especially in those who MD be electro - sensitive . Now here is DT strange part . When I swept a well VB federal Whistleblower ’s home , I found significant dirty electricity in DT AC circuits WDT were easily reduced down to an acceptable level by DT installation of Greenwave Filters . But I RB found especially high microwave levels being emitted from his two remote phone base stations which are powerful transmitters . When I mentioned DT reading was 4,400 microwatts DT level immediately reduced down to about 1,000 microwatts . Later when I crept into DT room again PRP was up at 4,400 microwatts and immediately dropped when I mentioned PRP verbally . This of course has alarming ramifications if PRP VBP PRP through . This means IN language is being monitored in real NN through DT remote phone system most likely by use of automatic A.I . I have been told by friends IN sometimes PRP will comment to another person I am VBG to ask my Smartphone a question only to have DT answer given as PRP recite DT first word or two into DT phone . PRP ’s IN DT NN an individual told his fiancé he was VBG to ask his Smartphone what day he MD have to turn DT clock back for DT end of Daylight Savings NN . As he recited DT first word “ when ” DT Smartphone recited DT complete answer to him before he MD even speak DT question enough to understand PRP . This strongly suggests real NN A.I. monitoring of all speech patterns within a certain distance of DT Smartphone and has alarming implications for not only A.I. base surveillance but RB suggests IN perhaps Dimensional wave ( D - wave ) quantum physics have been integrated into some Smartphones and remote phone systems . — Wi -Fi : Wi-Fi has been removed in an increasing number of JJ schools in Canada and Europe due to significant NN concerns for NNS and their undeveloped neurological systems which can be more vulnerable to DT harmful effects of EMF . Pulsed beam microwave transmitters were first installed in a national sporting good chain as a mind - kontrol test which was an NSA proprietary . Several managers and workers with no mental NN histories suddenly and unexpectedly “ cracked ” and had to be taken away by paramedics . DT pulsed beam microwaves had been turned up too high and some employees simply cracked from excessive EMF to their brains . DT next place these Wi-Fi systems were installed and tested was in certain select JJ high schools , especially DT NN visited by Bush2 when he was NN . In CD installation I monitored , this Wi-Fi was deployed as a psychotronic weapon system to make some targeted “ stand up ” highly moral teachers very , very sick . As an adjunct poisonous enzymes were sprayed onto DT desks of certain targeted teachers . Some got cancer , some died , some cracked , some just quit . All this covered up under so - called “ national security ” which was invoked . Other stand up targeted teachers WDT survived DT EMF assaults were then wrongly accused of accessing pornography websites but with no actual proof . In CD particular High School where this was done , DT administration was linked to Intel and was stealing million of JJ funds using sophisticated means while running two sets of books . Complaints to DT local NNP Attorney with good evidence supplied and to DT NNP Department of Education Inspector General resulted in an early retirement for DT NNP Attorney and nothing was done in DC either . DT strategy was to drive out any teachers who had strong character and MD see what was VBG on . Good counter - measures for those sensitive to Wi-Fi include hard wiring all computers , eliminating all Wi-Fi especially in PRP ’s home and shielding wall if PRP lives in multiple dwellings where others Wi -Fi come through with strong signal strength . Wi - Fi has been known to effect some sensitive individuals and can cause DT same type of behavioral and NN issues WDT are now linked to dirty electricity , Lilly Waves and excessive EMF in general . PRP now VBP for certain IN EMF does not have to heat DT human cell or human tissue as PRP have been told for NNS by DT CDC , DT USAF and various electrical engineering departments at major Universities to entrain DT brain or influence attitudes , beliefs and behaviors . — Cell phone towers : Some experts suggest maintaining a certain distance from these EMF emitters when possible . Those close by cell towers have reported sleeping difficulties , behavioral effects such as irritability , marital conflicts not RB before and JJ unexpected NN issues . Insiders have reported IN these cell tower systems have been deployed as part of as massive psychotronic war against DT American mind to break up relationships and families , make folks sick and to mind - kontrol by remote inductive entrainment . In my city a big mega church was built . Soon after DT biggest cell phone tower with DT most transmitting antennas installed on PRP in three levels was built . I noticed IN DT intensity of DT EMF was strangely highest when DT church services were being held . I swept DT home of a suspected super soldier with an IQ of over 200 living nearby at his request and traced high EMF to DT tower and a special dish installed on PRP aimed at his home . Another pure coincidence I ’m sure . Painting and grounding walls will special EMF blocking paint available from www.lessemf.com and other vendors can be effective in reducing cell phone NNS for electro - sensitive individuals or those who are concerned about being too close to cell phone transmission towers . — Radar and Dopplar radar : For NNS JJ effects were denied by DT USAF and yet significant proof emerged IN those airman exposed to a lot of radar had increased frequency of cataracts and certain cancers . Those too close to these emitters can use grounded screening on interior walls or special grounded EMF blocking paint . DT same paint DT NSA uses in their SCIFs is now available from numerous vendors IN www.lessemf.com. PRP is fairly pricey but PRP is a CD NN expense and some believe PRP is worth PRP . — Ground based , vehicle based , aircraft based or satellite based microwaves and pulsed beam microwaves aimed and / or triangulated at selected targeted individuals : These systems are expensive to deploy and must be scheduled . therefore PRP are usually only deployed against whistleblowers or in certain experiments . DT usual EMF shielding methodologies IN DT use of special grounded , metallized primer paints can be quite effective , except for DT JJ X - ray lasers which require much heavier , thicker shielding . — Ground based ELF systems aimed and / or triangulated at certain selected individuals : These systems are usually complex working in tandem with other technologies and are deployed against whistleblowers or targeted individuals who have been randomly selected to serve as experimental controls . DT talk inside deep Intel circles is IN all these systems are still being calibrated and experimented with using A.I. Someday in DT future PRP is expected IN DT Secret Shadow NNP will integrate all this knowledge and turn over control of all DT remote inductive entrainment systems to centralized A.I. control run out of DT NSA Bluffdale , Utah Base , using DT JJ NN ’s largest Quantum computer , Vesuvius . Obviously by now most readers have figured out IN DT NSA is actually run by DT same soulless , unimaginably evil Plutocratic Oligarchs from DT thirteen Bloodline families who are deploying this Alien ET back engineered / derived psychotronic technology to advance and manage DT implementation of their age - old inter- generational Globalist NWO Agenda of pure anti-human evil . — Cell Phones and Smart phones : PRP is now apparent IN JJ of these have real NN A.I. interaction - oriented quantum based surveillance powers . Some insiders have alleged IN DT particular wave forms and frequencies have been designed to entrain attitudes , thought patterns and even beliefs . DT jury is still out on this claim , but based on what I have seen so far PRP MD n’t surprise me . Plus EX is now a big concern by JJ researchers in numerous nations WDT holding these phones close and making contact with PRP ’s head , IN ordinary cell phones and using them too much , can perhaps cause various types of brain cancer . OJ ’s attorney Johnny Cochran bragged how he got rid of CD of his secretaries after he decided to do all his business by cell phone . He was on PRP JJ hours a day , held PRP close to his head and died of brain cancer soon after DT OJ trial ended . Mere coincidence or damage caused by too much , too intense EMF ? EX are several ways to mitigate this excessive EMF from Smartphones , just IN with ordinary cell phones . Talking with DT phone at least 4 - 6 inches from ones head , use of certain styles of remote earphones , air powered DT best , or DT use of DT speaker phone , , or use of special fabric pockets which block radiation to DT head while talking but still allow DT phone to work . Note : In European NN studies by MDs , 3 - 6 % of DT populace has been shown to have altered EKGs and EEGs . In at least CD Scandinavian nation , EMF sensitivity is a recognized JJ disability and a sanctuary city has been set up with highly reduced EMF NNS for those so designated to live in .  References : Here are some places to start to gain more information for those interested and have NN . Much of DT American Internet is censored through DT search engines which have NSA and / or Fusion center intercepts using advanced real NN A.I. Algorithms , so PRP is very hard to VB good information . JJ Internet articles are simply blocked from searches in America to keep DT American NNS from ever finding out about DT potential NN hazards and mind - kontrol aspects of Smartmeters , Wi-Fi , remote phones ( some of DT worst can emit 4500 microwatts per square meter when DT JJ European standard is no more than 100 microwatts per square meter within 10 feet . EX are RB numerous “ Popular mechanics style ” misinformation intercept articles on DT web to mislead and detract from DT now evident EMF dangers , especially to NNS . Lilly waves : Lilly waves can now be roughly measured using either DT Greenwave or DT Stetzerizer dirty electricity meters which can be purchased direct from them . Patrick Flanagan on Lilly waves ( Jeff Rense show ) : https://youtu.be/Q6yu8E0wN2A Smartmeters damage NN - NNP RangerNatural Blaze on Smartmeters : Electromagnetic HealthShielding a bedroom for EMF : Grounding wire for screens used for blocking smart meters : How to paint and install EMF shielding : EMF reducing paint safety specs : Painting a bedroom with T98 Alpha Geovital EMF reducing paint Ultra high tech psychotronics , remote mental induction and quantum - based surveillance are DT JJ weapons of war being waged covertly against mankind by DT International Satanic Pedophile Network ( Ruling Cabal ) through DT Deep Black unacknowledged , special access Intel cell deeply buried within certain Defense Contractors . Most of those working on these projects are so compartmented by “ Need to VB ” IN few understand how these devastating weapons of war are being deployed to mind - kontrol and sicken JJ Americans . Those WDT do , who sit at DT top of DT pyramid or run these special access programs , are criminal sociopaths WDT lost their souls long ago , and most have been initiated into DT Satanic Pedophile Network ( Ruling Cabal ) WDT runs most of DT NN . Now for DT difficult conclusion to all this . All MK - Ultra sleeper violence in America ( including DT real mass - shootings in gun-free zones ) , and all Radical Islamic violence ( ISIS type mercenary forces ) are created , paid for , trained , supplied and energized and activated by orders and authorization of DT Ruling Cabal . JJ so - called radical Islamic mercenaries are not really followers of Islam at all , but have been raised in special camps for abandoned NNS , mind - kontrolled through drugs , trauma - conditioning and psychotronics at an early age . PRP , as well as other paid mercenaries , are mind - kontrolled and inducted with psychotic belief patterns WDT make them easy for DT Cabal to remotely activate . PRP can thus be transformed into savage torturers , heartless rapists and murderers of innocent men , women and NNS — all done to deliver blood sacrifices to Satan on behalf of DT Ruling Cabal to provide them more power as promised by Satan ( their words not mine ) . Sadly , PRP ’s a fact IN JJ current social movements are by - products of Bernays - type , Madison Avenue social modeling , cultural Mind - kontrol , as well as ultra high tech remote inductive technologies WDT entrain DT human brain and generate synthetic belief patterns and attitudes which cause individuals to acts in ways contrary to their own long term best interests . At little as five NNS ago , to even discuss these subjects publicly usually resulted in termination as an immediate sanction . Thanks to DT Internet and hundreds of honest Intel and LE individuals who refused to keep quiet about these inhuman crimes , DT NN can now have access to this information , if PRP so desire . And more and more folks VBP to VB why PRP are having trouble sleeping , are tired too much , have difficulty concentrating and feel off kilter . DT Cabal ’s Plan is part of DT Globalist NWO Agenda of Evil to keep experimenting and fine tuning these technologies separately to spy on Americans while mind - controlling them at DT same NN . Without these devices such as smart phones and Wi-Fi providing desirable features of convenience , few MD use them , and DT Cabal MD not be able to fine tune these technologies . Once DT fine tuning is complete , DT Cabal has planned to combine them under control of a massive Quantum computer using A.I. automatic controls and operating through inter-dimensional wave forms . At this point , PRP believe PRP will be able to make whole populations completely mind - kontrolled and cloned / hived to DT mother A.I. computer ; or make sick or even murder whole human populations at will . Then PRP plan to eliminate 90 % of all humans and replace them with their own synthetic race of hybrids , a combination of clay and iron ( biology and manufactured electrical components ) . Looks IN DT Cabal has been having some recent bumps in DT road with DT unexpected side effects of DT Internet which has turned out to be DT NNP Gutenberg Press and is now undermining DT NNP Roman Empire run out of DT Vatican , which was hijacked by DT Black Pope and DT Old Black Nobility long ago , DT folks WDT really run DT Ruling Cabal . When DT Gutenberg Press appeared , PRP undermined DT Vatican by making DT Bible available to all — something DT Vatican desperately wanted to prevent . Right now populism has emerged inside America and much of DT western NN and is growing in power by DT day . If not stopped this will be DT death of DT Cabal ’s Globalist NWO efforts . Never forget — all these various types of Mind - kontrol through these Satanic Black Arts and back - engineered Alien ET technologies do not work well on folks with strong character , integrity and love in their hearts for their fellow man , who have decided to live by DT golden rule to treat others DT way PRP VBP to be treated . PRP is this immutable human spirit , energized by love towards others , WDT poses DT greatest risk to DT Ruling cabal , and cannot ever be snuffed out . I am pretty certain DT Cabal will eventually be defanged and stopped and will lose control over these weapons before PRP can combine them and succeed in their Globalist NWO Agenda of Evil . Disclaimer : None of this is to be taken as NN care recommendations . This article is a mere presentation of some basic information to those who are interested . If PRP are having problems PRP VBP are based on electro - sensitivity to EMF or excessive EMF , PRP can seek consultation with a qualified expert ( EX are some but PRP will have to carefully search them out ) . Before PRP come to any conclusions about all these issues , spend some NN researching these subjects on DT Internet . DT references provided are mere starting points . Those who live in European nations will probably find PRP much easier to VB access to scientifically based data on EMF sensitivity and EMF levels PRP should limit exposure to .  Joe Bonamassa , Child Guitar prodigy and DT newly designated “ King of DT Blues ” since BB King ’s passing . Joe just made his JJ hit “ Hummingbird ” , which he played at DT Greek Theater available to all on youtube.com . His amazing concert at DT Greek Theater will probably VB down in music history as DT greatest Blues concert ever , and Joe ’s performance was stellar , his greatest achievement yet , and his backup singers and band are most impressive . Headphones and HD settings are recommended . https://youtu.be/KxCETqCv3g4 http://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/11/21/secret-deep-black-war-to-hijack-your-mind-steal-your-country-and-make-you-sick/ PRP can actually participate in DT JJ efforts to cripple DT Deep NNP organized criminal cabal 's ability for genocide , while enjoying healthcare freedom at DT same NN , by boycotting Big Pharma for good ."

Kelsey was expecting a child sized t shirt featuring characters from DT NNS ’s book “ Frog And Toad . ” DT shirt was just $ 5 in DT “ LadyBaby Store ” on AliExpress.com , so Kelsey decided to order PRP for her daughter Salem . EX was no text on DT image of DT shirt WDT was shown in DT LadyBaby store , and PRP was described as a “ Kids Two Frog Riding Design Baby Boys / Girl T Shirt Kids Funny Short Sleeve Tops NNPS Cute T Shirt . ” However , when Kelsey received DT shirt in DT mail , DT From and Toad image was on DT front , but PRP RB had large text WDT read , “ FUCK DT POLICE . ” Kelsey told Buzz Feed NN IN she was shocked , but not offended by DT shirt . She actually thought IN DT whole situation was kind of funny . “ I literally did not VB how to react so I just took a few moments to stare at PRP and try to process … Of all DT things PRP MD have added , why DT ? On a NNS ’s size shirt ? ” Kelsey VBD . Kelsey then decided to share DT amusing situation with her friends on social NN , so she put DT shirt on her daughter Salem and took a few pictures . Of course , DT child is way too young to read , so she had no clue what PRP VBD . Kelsey posted a photo to Facebook , showing Salem wearing DT shirt , with DT following caption : “ What I ordered VS what I received . I fucking love NNP . I can not stop screaming . WHO DOES THIS . ” PRP seems IN whoever made DT shirt took a Frog and Toad “ fuck DT police ” meme WDT had been circulating on Reddit for use in their design . However , PRP is not clear if PRP were able to read English or understand what DT message actually VBD . Kelsey VBD IN DT image quickly went viral after she shared PRP with her friends . “ I originally just shared DT t- shirt with only my friends until CD of them wanted to share PRP to their profile , so I made PRP JJ . I definitely was n’t expecting PRP to VB this far . PRP all happened so fast , ” DT young mother explained . Unfortunately , not everyone had a good sense of humor IN Kelsey did . Some NNS who got offended by DT shirt sent Kelsey mean and threatening messages . “ NNS were actually messaging me just to say mean things about her . A ton of NNS calling her fat , asking me what I feed her to make her so big , telling me DT shirt I bought was too small , ” she VBD . Some parents might have been angry or offended by getting an item IN this , but Kelsey sees PRP as a memorable experience WDT Salem will VB a laugh out of someday . “ I ’ve told [ Salem ] ‘ NNS really VBP your frog shirt ! ’ PRP ’s VBG in her baby box so PRP can bring PRP up when she ’s older , ” she VBD . Sadly , DT listing has since been removed from DT store , so DT shirt is no longer available for purchase . This is a very similar situation to when English speaking NNS VBP Chinese words tattooed on them without actually knowing DT true meaning behind DT symbols . Earlier this NN , pop star Ariana Grande made headlines after getting a misspelled Japanese tattoo . She intended DT tattoo to say “ 7 Rings ” which is RB DT name of her newest album . However , when she posted an image of DT tattoo to social NN , JJ NNS recognized IN EX was a misspelling in DT art , and DT tattoo actually VBD “ shichirin , ” which is a small Japanese barbecue grill . Grande later clarified IN DT original photo she posted was an incomplete version of DT tattoo WDT she took while DT work was in progress . Grande says IN DT pain was so intense because of DT location of DT tattoo , and IN DT artwork had to be done in two sessions . Shortly after DT controversy caused by her photo , DT pop star VBD IN she got DT tattoo completed ."

After an initial $ 7.5 billion investment , production is set to start in 2014 at DT Jack / St. Malo facility , with a capacity of 170,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) , Chevron VBD on Thursday . DT U.S. NN halted deepwater drilling in DT Gulf after DT BP Plc ( BP.L ) well rupture in April WDT caused DT worst - ever U.S. marine oil spill and killed 11 workers . During DT moratorium , DT NN reviewed industry safety procedures and has formulated some JJ regulations aimed at preventing another deadly blow - out . EX is still much uncertainty surrounding oil and gas exploration in DT Gulf . JJ regulations are not finalized , and analysts see higher costs and slower progress even for companies with budgets big enough to drill in deep NN . But Mohammad Rahman , at research firm Wood Mackenzie in Houston , VBD despite DT delays , operators MD press ahead . “ Everybody is aware of DT regulations and safety requirements VBG forward , but PRP are n’t hindered , ” he VBD . Chevron , DT second - largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) , VBD PRP MD develop DT Jack and St. Malo projects at a NN depth of 7,000 feet ( 2,100 metres ) , about 280 miles ( 450 km ) off DT Louisiana coast . Initial development of DT projects will require about $ 7.5 billion to construct three subsea centers WDT will tie back to a hub linking DT projects , which lie about 25 miles apart . This will be yet another big investment for Chevron in DT Gulf . DT San Ramon , California - based company is RB due to make a final investment decision on DT Big Foot project before DT end of this NN . DT project MD produce up to 63,000 bpd . Big Foot will be built in 5,300 feet ( 1,600 metres ) of NN , about 200 miles ( 320 km ) from NNP Orleans and 35 miles ( 55 km ) south of Chevron ’s Tahiti field , a 135,000 - bpd development WDT started up in NNP 2009 . In 2009 , Chevron ’s Gulf net daily production averaged 149,000 barrels of crude oil , 484 million cubic feet of natural gas and 14,000 barrels of natural gas liquids . DT Jack and St. Malo fields are estimated to hold 500 million recoverable oil - equivalent barrels . Since 2003 , seven exploration and appraisals wells have been drilled in DT fields , which are in DT Lower Tertiary trend — a geological formation WDT is below areas drillers have typically tapped . “ DT Lower Tertiary is recognized as a huge resource with DT potential for long life projects of up to 30 to 40 NNS and DT opportunity to enhance recoveries through technology , ” Chevron Vice Chairman George Kirkland VBD in a statement . In March , Chevron announced first oil from DT Perdido deepwater development , a similar project RB located in DT Lower Tertiary . Over DT next five to eight NNS , Wood Mackenzie sees DT Lower Tertiary adding 200,000 bpd of production in total , which compares with current deepwater Gulf output of about 1.8 million bpd of oil equivalent , including natural gas . Chevron has working interests of 50 percent in DT Jack field , 51 percent in DT St. Malo field , and 50.67 percent in DT host facility . Chevron ’s shares closed 23 cents higher on DT NNP York Stock Exchange , outperforming a sector WDT was dragged down by a 2 percent drop in oil prices .

No , His Holiness is exactly where he should be , still proudly astride his golden throne in Switzerland , contemplating ways to use another term as DT hallowed father of Fifa to deliver even more joy and peace to DT JJ footballing family . Amen . Uefa has decided not to boycott Friday ’s presidential elections in DT wake of DT FBI collaring a – what ’s DT right collective term here ? - brown envelope of Fifa executives ; and Britain ’s Tory NN , renowned for its intolerance of white collar chicanery , has called for Blatter to be replaced to help deodorise a sport WDT should be known for nothing other than DT excellence of players from teams such as Aston Ham and West Harlequins and , oh , PRP VBP , all those others sides with great batsmen . But EX are still NNS brave enough to stand up for DT doctrine of Blatter Infallbility . “ This is yet another blatant attempt [ by DT NNP NNPS ] to extend its jurisdiction to other NNS , ” stormed Vladimir Putin , who seemingly ranks suggestions of wrongdoing by Fifa alongside other fictional notions such as Big Foot , unicorns and Ukrainian sovereignty . “ PRP ’s a clear attempt not to allow Mr Blatter to be re-elected as NN of Fifa , which is a great violation of DT operating principles of international organisations , ” added Putin , without specifying whether due process should instead involve tanks and surface - to - air missiles . So IN PRP no longer have to wonder what DT head of DT Guinea Bissau Football Association makes of all this , Manuel Nascimento Lopes piped up today to reassert his deep faith in Blatter and denounce DT diabolical campaign against him . “ I ’m a Christian and this is blasphemy , ” Nascimento Lopes blurted to Insideworldfootball.com , seemingly deifying DT Swiss before hastily pointing out IN this god is not omniscient : “ NNS say Blatter must have known about this but do I VB other NNS ’s secrets ? ” • Follow DT Fifa congress opening ceremony live right here . QUOTE OF DT DAY “ DT club wishes to VB IN tomorrow ’s press conference concerns only footballing matters related to Napoli and not DT future of Benítez ” – Napoli club statement , 27 NNP . “ I MD VB to thank DT NN , DT club and all DT fans because after two NNS I ’m finishing my experience here with Napoli ” - Rafa Benitez , 28 NNP . “ Hang on a minute . PRP sounds IN David Lagercrantz [ yesterday ’s Fiver quote of DT day ] is actually DT NN ’s greatest ghostwriter and has nothing to apologise for if he managed to make Zlatan retrospectively concur IN his ‘ Zlatan quotes ’ were actually Zlatan quotes .

Chelsea fan here , I am more than fine with football being a stick of celery and I hope DT metaphor never changes ” — Damien Neva . “ IN Adrian Foster ’s letter about Xavi . Whilst I agree with DT sentiment can I just point out IN DT ‘ CD club man ’ is actually signing for another club ? Much IN Gerrard .

Real Madrid have denied PRP are making a move for Paul Pogba , which if this is a precedent then brace yourselves for a looooooooooooong summer . Looks IN EA Sports are moving into DT 20th century , some 16 NNS after DT rest of PRP left PRP , after PRP announced women ’s teams will be available in DT upcoming Fifa 16 game . Steve McClaren ’s reward for helming Derby ’s heroic bottle job MD be a gig at Sunderland , after Dick Advocaat decided to show himself DT door marked ‘ Do CD . ’ Showing IN sentimentality has no place in football , Hull have released their two longest serving players – Liam Rosenior and Paul McShane – who are among six invited aboard DT good ship ‘ Do CD ’ .

Journal_NNP of_IN Vertebrate_NNP Paleontology_NNP 27:409–419_CD ._.","You'd be forgiven for looking at a pigeon and straining to believe IN its ancestors were dinosaurs . This is a creature , after all , WDT descended from some of DT finest killing machines evolution has ever produced to now drink gutter NN and assault old NNS for bread crumbs . But millions of NNS before birds were bumming for handouts in parks , PRP had risen right to DT top of DT food chain . In fact , PRP filled DT vacated niches of their menacing theropod forebears IN Velociraptor . These are DT terror birds : scrappy , powerful critters WDT drove their enormous hooked beaks through small mammals as easily as DT guy who put a pickax through my crazy uncle 's skull in a bar fight WDT CD NN ( he survived , and no , I 'm not even kidding ) . DT 18 known species , DT tallest growing to a staggering 10 feet tall , did n’t bother with flying , instead opting to chase down all those creatures WDT had only just thrown their good - riddance - to - DT - massive - carnivorous - dinosaurs party . DT poor things woke up with a hangover , and DT hangover was DT terror bird . PRP was 60 million NNS ago in South America , which had not yet joined with its northern counterpart , where DT terror birds rose to power in isolation as apex predators . Even given their success , their fossils are fragmentary and extremely rare , according to paleontologist Luis Chiappe , who in 2007 described DT titanic , strangely boxy noggin of DT biggest terror bird ever : Kelenken , named after DT fearsome bird spirit of Patagonia ’s native Tehuelche NNS . “ PRP 's DT largest known skull for terror birds , ” he VBD . “ As a matter of fact , PRP ’s DT largest known bird skull , period . PRP ’s about two - and - a - half feet long , an enormous , colossal beast with a very big hook at DT end of DT beak IN an eagle . ” From fossils IN these , paleontologists reckon IN terror birds were no crumb - loving pigeons , and not just because EX was no bread back then . While a skull can’t tell PRP exactly how PRP killed , for Chiappe , this is clearly DT beak of a carnivore . “ I mean , PRP VBP IN a little parrot , a cockatoo , can take your finger out , ” he VBD . “ Imagine what a bird IN this MD have done , DT damage PRP MD have done with just a strike of this massive skull and beak . So DT 's obviously CD very easy way of imagining this is how these animals killed their prey . ” DT terror birds called forests their home , likely lying in wait to ambush DT JJ small mammals WDT proliferated in South America after DT fall of DT dinosaurs . But their skulls and beaks probably were n’t strong enough to tackle large prey , biomechanical studies have shown . With their massively developed legs , PRP MD have been more than capable of chasing down scampering critters : These were extremely nimble , swift predators , hitting speeds of perhaps 30 mph . ( This should n’t come as a surprise to anyone who has witnessed DT surprisingly frantic , not to mention hilarious , way IN ostriches run , UH giant 40 - mph feather dusters having panic attacks . ) At DT end of terror bird legs were talons , so PRP MD have been IN DT beasts fired an initial jab with their beaks , then stood on their prey and rapidly shivved PRP to death . Or perhaps chomped down on their quarry and shook PRP until its spine snapped . And PRP might RB look for clues in DT terror birds ’ living cousins , DT seriemas , for further speculation . These South American birds are only a couple of feet tall , but are nonetheless adept hunters , snagging lizards and rodents and such with their talons and bashing them on rocks to shatter their bones . PRP ’s even been suggested IN DT terror birds were n’t terrors at all . Instead , PRP were full - blown vegetarians , terroir birds , if PRP will . Last NN , German NNS announced DT results of a geochemical analysis of terror bird bones , finding IN their calcium isotope compositions aligned them more with herbivores than carnivores . But Chiappe dismisses DT notion IN such a powerfully built creature was anything but a predator . DT terror birds , he argues , sported truly massive heads relative to body size , much IN modern eagles and very much unlike modern omnivorous terrestrial birds IN emus and ostriches and cassowaries . “ I VBP IN personally PRP can come up with all these very rather innovative views , but I VBP IN PRP makes a lot of sense IN these animals were predators , ” he VBD . “ PRP ’s just DT same when someone came up with DT idea IN T. rex was a scavenger . I 'm sure PRP ate dead meals , but I 'm sure PRP killed . ” “ Maybe [ DT terror birds ’ ] bite force was not strong enough , ” he added , “ maybe PRP were limited to preying on certain animals , but DT does n't make them in my opinion a non-predatory bird . ” Whatever their diet , and whatever their methods of feeding , DT empire of DT terror birds entered a slow decline starting around 4.5 million NNS ago , when DT Central American isthmus formed , joining two heretofore self - contained continents . All those creatures WDT had evolved in isolation for millions of NNS now found themselves mingling and schmoozing and shaking hands – with their teeth . Terror birds made their way up into what is now DT southern NNP NNPS , while North America ’s top predators – bears and big cats – colonized South America . “ So PRP had to face JJ competition for DT same resources , ” VBD Chiappe , “ and DT combined with perhaps changes in NN PRP MD not have been able to cope with and DT MD have impacted their hunting strategies , probably drove them to extinction . ” And so PRP is IN EX ’s never been a bird , no matter how terrifying , IN a cat MD n’t somehow keep in check . In a way PRP was a lot IN DT eternal struggles of Sylvester and Tweety , only with , PRP VBP , more murder and fewer speech impediments . Browse DT full Absurd Creature of DT Week archive here .

Take PRP off , PRP look silly . ” Where ’s DT proof IN DT NN has this capability ? PRP might recall a fellow by DT name of ( retired ) Gen. David Petraeus . He ’s been in DT NN lately . This four - star general - turned - CIA chief just resigned his post after NN broke IN he had engaged in an extra-marital affair with is biographer , herself a West Point graduate and former Army officer . What led to this shocking discovery was Petraeus ’ use , of all things , Google ’s online email service , Gmail .

But nevertheless , DT technology to pilfer email accounts at will obviously exists . “ Forget ECHELON , or signals intelligence , or DT interception of communications by black boxes installed covertly in data centers , ” writes Zack Whittaker for ZDNet . “ Intelligence agencies and law enforcement bodies can access – thanks to DT shift towards Web - based email services in DT cloud – but PRP ’s not as exciting or as Jack Bauer - esque as PRP MD VB or hope for . ” How DT top CIA official got busted When he set up his private Gmail account , Petraeus used a pseudonym and composed email messages but never sent them . PRP were instead saved as drafts . His lover , Paula Broadwell , MD then log in under DT same account , read DT drafts then reply to them in DT same manner – as a draft , without actually sending DT message . DT exchanges MD not be sent across DT networks through Google ’s data centers , which MD make PRP nearly impossible for DT NSA or any other ELINT ( electronic intelligence ) agency ( IN Britain ’s GCHQ or DT Israeli Mossad ) to “ read ” DT messages while PRP are in transit between accounts . Other sinister operators – terrorists , pedophiles and DT JJ – have been known to use DT same trick to avoid detection , ZDNet reported . “ But surely IP addresses are logged and noted ? When emails are sent and received , yes . But DT emails were saved in draft and therefore were not sent . However , Google MD still have a record of DT IP addresses of those who logged into DT account , ” DT report VBD . In DT end , DT FBI used a little - VBN law called DT Stored Communications Act , which is part of DT Electronic Communications Privacy Act , as DT basis for getting a warrant to view Petraeus ’ private Gmail account . And DT ’s how agents found DT stored messages WDT were never actually sent . “ Once PRP knew Ms. Broadwell was DT sender of DT threatening messages , DT FBI got a warrant WDT gave PRP covert access to DT anonymous email account , ” DT BBC ’s Mark Ward reported ."

DT powers WDT be were happy to trash out DT name of George W. Bush ; but Bush was just a poster - boy for a criminal syndicate which has taken over DT NNP NNPS . Obama was placed into office with a plethora of newsmedia hype , praise and worship ; but DT first NN of DT Obama Presidency has accomplished more evil than all DT 8 NNS George W. Bush spent in office . Already , Obama has increased DT national debt more than any other U.S. NNP in American history . Something is very wrong with DT . PRP 's all a big deception . DT corporate - controlled newsmedia has led DT masses in praise of a politician who is selling PRP out . I am a CITIZEN of DT NNP NNPS . As such , I love my country . I do not hate anyone ; but I hate evil as God commands all believers to do ( Psalm 97:10 ; Ephesians 5:11 ) . EX is not a more vile evil in America today than DT Socialist policies Barack Hussein Obama will implement over DT next few NNS in America . Respectfully , Obama has lied repeatedly to America and works for DT NNP NNP Order elite , who hate America . PRP hate DT God of DT Bible , Christianity , patriots and DT traditional family . Obama promised not to raise taxes ; but he did . Obama promised not to propose any laws without first notifying DT American NN ; but he has been secretive about JJ NN laws . Obama broke his campaign pledge not to hire Wall Street insiders ; but he has . Obama promised to bring DT troops home ; but he has sent more . Just IN JJ politicians , Obama promised DT rainbow ; but delivered something very different . Obama promised NN for DT positive ; but PRP are experiencing NN for DT worse . Some have questioned whether Obama is a Communist or not ? I can tell PRP by definition of DT word “ Communism ” WDT HE IS . CD of DT definitions of DT noun Communism is “ a socialist who advocates Communism . ” Obama is an Anti-American , God-hating Communist wrapped in a smile . Obama was not elected ; he was chosen and placed into office . I am not saying IN Barack Obama is DT Antichrist , but PRP is a Biblical teaching WDT high political positions will be given by Satan in DT End Times ... Revelation 13:2 b , “ and DT dragon [ Satan ] gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority . ” DT Antichrist will have great authority . PRP is very interesting IN NNP Obama is DT FIRST U.S. NNP to ever be made chairman of DT NNP Nations Security Council . CNN reported IN Obama has been called "" DT NNP of DT NN . ” Certainly , DT overwhelming international JJ support of Barack Obama is arguably a form of worship . I believe IN DT Rapture is very near . Even so , come , Lord Jesus ! In his book "" Dream of My Father , "" Obama refers to his Communist mentor Frank Marshall Davis as simply "" Frank , a father figure . "" He does n't even reveal Frank Davis ' last name hoping IN DT NN will not find out IN "" Frank , a father figure , "" is in reality a firebrand Communist labor agitator who identified himself as a Marxist lecturer and poet in 1964 . Starting to VB DT picture ? DT Chicago group who organized and funded Obama 's first two campaigns look IN a Who 's Who of Communist activities dating from DT violent 1960's . Chief among them was Tom Hayden , William Ayers and Bernadette Dorhn . ALL THREE ARE TO THIS VERY DAY UNREPENTANT AND UNAPOLOGETICALLY COMMUNIST AND PRP STILL SUPPORT THEIR FRIEND BARACK OBAMA FINANCIALLY . DT American NNS have once again been duped by a charismatic man who makes a good speech . Barack Obama is a Communist by definition and is supported by , funded by and advised by radical left wing Communists who seek to VB our form of NN from Capitalism to Socialism !!! On DT day Obama won DT election , I was saddened to see supports waving Communist flags behind Obama on FOX NNP . In Capitalism , a person keeps what PRP earn . In Socialism , a person keeps what someone else earns . In Communism , everyone is a slave to DT NN . Socialism is DT Devil getting his foot in your front door . Communism is when DT Devil takes control of your home . America 's days are numbering before PRP are NO LONGER a free nation . I am ashamed of my own Independent Fundamental Baptist Church camp in America , who have remained virtually silent about so JJ evils , particularly in DT area of blatant NN crimes , corruption and treason . PRP does n't require a private investigator to figure out IN TRILLIONS of missing taxpayer dollars is unacceptable . After viewing DT evidence , only a complete moron MD buy into DT lie IN Islam is to blame for DT 911 attacks . “... He DT ruleth over men must be just , ruling in DT fear of God . ” — 2nd Samuel 23:3 PRP is a sad day in American history . Few NNS realize IN all of DT recent nightmares in DT housing and job market were artificially induced by DT criminals controlling DT Federal Reserve , which is privately owned . PRP 's not federally owned and PRP have no reserve to back DT value of our money . Our money today has no intrinsic value . PRP is a paper game . Why do PRP VB NNP is buying up all DT NN 's gold ? PRP 're smart and PRP 're not , plain and simple . All of DT recent JJ troubles in America have been deliberately caused to condition PRP , to force PRP to beg for relief from a JJ leader , and IN leader is implementing Socialism as DT answer . America is in serious trouble as a nation and now PRP 've got a treasonous Communist as our NNP . Any NN leader who provides welfare benefits , jobs , healthcare , driver 's licenses and education to CRIMINALS who illegally cross our nation 's borders is committing treason . Treason by definition means “ an act of deliberate betrayal . ” When Ronald Reagan allowed General Motors to shut down their Flint , Michigan plant in DT late 1980s and relocate to Mexico , DT was TREASON . 30,000 American citizens were laid off , JJ ended up on welfare and General Motors went on to make big profits by exploiting slave labor in Mexico . And DT price of automobiles just keeps VBG up . Allowing Illegal immigration is a deliberate act of treason by our NN leaders , as part of DT ongoing effort to destroy America 's sovereignty and bring about a NNP NNP Order , i.e. , a Godless NNP Totalitarian Communist Police NNP . PRP 's become so bad IN American citizens are now competing with illegal aliens for American jobs . PRP have been sold out by Democrat and Republican leaders alike . PRP are traitors . Freedom is DT right to be wrong ; not do wrong . Liberty is DT freedom to make our own choices ; freedom is DT result of making DT right choices . As Americans continue traveling down their sin-loving path , PRP are making all DT wrong decisions . EX MD be no corrupt NN if DT American NNS were right with God , because PRP MD refuse to tolerate such wickedness . DT problem is IN only a very small handful of Americans are right with God . NNS who live in sin become indifferent , apathetic and do n't care . Look at those who are DT most vigilant and fight DT hardest against DT evils of our NN , and PRP 'll discover IN most of them are born - against Christians who love Jesus Christ . PRP is clear as day IN Obama works for DT elite Banksters , just as all recent U.S. Presidents ... DT American NNS are losing all around . At present , EX are 35,000,000 Americans receiving Food Stamps . DT unemployment rate is at 16 % nationwide . Obama 's administration is calling this a “ jobless recovery , ” but EX are no jobs to come back , PRP 've all been outsourced to exploit foreign slave labor . By DT NN 2012 , PRP is probable IN nearly all Americans will work either directly or indirectly for DT federal NN . Every job WDT leaves America makes PRP just RB much more dependent upon DT NN to support PRP financially . DT federal NN has taken over DT banking , auto , lending and now soon to be , JJ industries . Big NN is bad for DT NNS . Please do n't misunderstand me , I am a firm believer in Romans 13 ( which teaches submission to DT higher powers ) . PRP ought to obey DT higher powers . I am not against NN , God forbid . I am against corruption , stealing from taxpayers and DT blatant evils being done by certain of our top leaders . DT U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights is a higher power than DT standing NN . When any leader (s ) violates our Bill of Rights and DT U.S. Constitution , PRP have commit treason against DT American NN . Instead of being for , of and by DT NNS ; NN today is for , by and of DT corporations . Corporations rule DT NN . PRP is just sad IN PRP have lost our once great nation . Ephesians 6:12 , “ For PRP wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against DT rulers of DT darkness of this NN , against spiritual wickedness in high places . ” And so PRP is . DT days of little league baseball , hotdogs and innocence are over . Everything today is centered around greed , chemicals in our food , societal paranoia , lying propaganda from DT newsmedia , militarized paranoid police , lewdness , dishonesty , fascist - style airport security , illegal drugs brought in by DT CIA , homosexuality , et cetera . Everything is so corrupt these days . NN 's original intent was to PROTECT our property , our rights and our freedoms , period . PRP was never intended for DT NN to educate our NNS , provide retirement services , give aid to foreign nations , provide healthcare to illegal immigrants , tamper with DT economy , provide welfare , et cetera . DT average American today has been brought up with DT mindset IN this is DT way PRP 's supposed to be , but PRP 's not . More and more American's are foolishly relying upon DT NN to solve their problems , whether PRP be financial , social , educational or moral . Obama is being hailed as a miracle leader , who will bring salvation to DT American NNS ; but his methods require increasing NN control , which ultimately can only lead to a Communist Police NNP . According to William Guy Carr , a diligent historian and Commander in DT U.S. Navy , every war and revolution since 1776 has been financed on both sides by DT monstrous International Banking Cartel ... "" While DT general NN has been led to believe IN Communism is a movement of DT workers ( Soviets ) to destroy Capitalism , "" Pawns In DT Game "" and "" DT Red Fog Over America "" prove IN both British and American Intelligence Officers obtained authentic documentary evidence which proved IN internationalist capitalists operating through their international banking houses had financed both sides in every war and revolution fought since 1776 . Those who to - day compromise DT Synagogue of Satan direct our governments , whom PRP hold in usury , to fight DT wars and revolutions so PRP further Pike 's plans to bring DT NN to DT stage of DT NN when Atheistic - Communism and DT whole of Christendom can be forced into an all - out war within each remaining nation as well as on an international scale . [ emphasis added ] EX is plenty of documentary evidence to prove IN Pike , IN Weishaupt , was head of DT Luciferian Priesthood in his day . "" SOURCE : PAWNS IN DT GAME , Introduction , page XVI , by William Guy Carr , 1958 These elite Banksters , all members of DT occult , are still working relentlessly today to bring about a NNP NNP Order at all cost ...

PRP is no coincidence DT DT Beatles were Communists , who praised Communist Russia in their song "" Back In DT U.S.S.R . "" DT British Invasion in DT 1960s brought Rock ' N ' Roll 's demonic message of rebellion , immoral sex and substance abuse to America . This was all part of DT Communist agenda to subvert America from within . Christianity and DT traditional family are under attack IN never before . Lest PRP VBP DT sounds IN paranoia , consider DT following statement by brutal Communist dictator Vladimir Lenin : "" DT best revolutionary is a youth devoid of morals . "" SOURCE : PAWNS IN DT GAME , page 126 , by William Guy Carr , 1958 PRP is no coincidence IN God was banned from DT NNP School System on 1963 , and DT unverifiable myth of Evolution is being taught instead to brainwash NNS . Evolution is a massive fraud . DT Big Bang is a big lie of DT Devil , a total denial of DT Biblical account of creation in Genesis . Hitler 's hatred and motive for killing DT innocent was rooted in Charles Darwin 's teachings on DT Origin Of Species . All archeological and historical data on record supports DT Bible 's claim of divine inspiration from God . And Please read Devilution . “ Evidence will be produced to prove IN Modern Communism was organized in DT NN 1773 by a group of International Money - Barons who have used PRP since , as their manual of action , to further their secret plans to bring about a Totalitarian Godless NNP . Lenin made this clear in his book Left Wing Communism . On page 53 , he VBD : "" Our theory ( Communism ) is not a dogma ( Settled Doctrine ) ; PRP is a manual of action . JJ modern leaders have VBN and done DT same things as Lucifer did during DT heavenly revolution . EX is no appreciable difference between Red and Black Atheism . DT only difference is in DT plans used by DT opposing leaders to ultimately win undisputed control of DT NN 's resources , and bring into being their ideas for a Totalitarian , Godless Dictatorship . ” SOURCE : PAWNS IN DT GAME , page 4 , by William Guy Carr , 1958 I respect DT Office of DT Presidency . I VBP NNS to VB DT . God is a God of authority . I disagree with those who portray Barack Obama as DT joker . I do n't VB NNS should do DT .

He began filming DT police car to document DT misconduct so IN he MD later present PRP to DT chief sergeant . Sleath was subsequently approached by DT two officers in DT car and was told he was being detained because he had breached Section 44 of DT Terrorism Act . “ ( DT officer ) was clearly embarrassed to be photographed where he should n’t have been and wanted to intimidate me , ” VBD Sleath . Section 44 previously only allowed police officers to stop and search somebody on “ reasonable grounds ” but DT has now been changed and is no longer necessary , leading to an explosion in frivolous stop and search incidents . 44 % of complaints made about stop and search allege assault by police officers . However , DT nature of Sleath ’s detainment raises questions about whether police were actually enforcing 58A of DT 2000 Terrorism Act , a passage replicated in DT 2008 Counter Terrorism Act . As PRP have previously highlighted , this section contains ambiguous language which suggests IN merely filming or photographing police officers is an act of terrorism . When journalist organizations expressed fears IN this law MD effectively outlaw a huge part of their profession , PRP were told by PC Alan Cousins of DT Metropolitan Police Film Unit IN DT law MD not impede them . Cousins stated IN taking photos of police officers “ MD not be caught by this offence , ” but added IN PRP MD be in “ exceptional circumstances ” . In London , filming anything is treated as a sign of potential terrorism . PRP were filming floral tributes left at DT entrance to Stockwell tube station where Jean Charles De Menezes was brutally gunned down by police in July 2005 . PRP were approached by a police officer and subsequently entered into DT terror database – ostensibly for filming flowers without permission from DT NN . Britain has around 4.2 million CCTV cameras – CD for every fourteen NNS – and Big Brother has carte blanche to watch PRP 24/7 – but woe betide PRP actually turn DT camera back on DT authorities , because DT makes PRP a potential terrorist . Indeed , a recent London Metropolitan Police poster campaign directly implied IN filming a CCTV camera was a probable act of terrorism and encouraged NNS to report anyone for doing so . DT video below shows UK police threatening a man with reprisals for filming them , claiming IN PRP is an offence to record DT police . DT cops phone DT police station and are told IN EX is no law WDT forbids DT NN from filming them . However , this was two NNS ago , before DT recent amendment to DT law was passed .

PRP means AFL is inclusive of all body types , as some are better for sprinting and others are better at tackling . Personally , I love DT physicality of DT game . PRP keeps PRP on your toes as PRP do n’t VB where DT next tackle is coming from . I love running and sprinting . Aussie Rules gives me DT opportunity to showcase my talent , especially on bigger fields . ” “ I was excited to play because I followed DT game and watched my brothers play . EX was never an opportunity for me to play until 2011 when I cofounded DT Auburn Tigers , DT first Western Sydney Women ’s AFL team . At DT NN , all my team mates , except for DT Captain ( Kiz ) and I , did n’t understand DT rules – so PRP had to teach them . DT team relied on my leadership and I was passionate about making sure PRP enjoyed PRP . I spent a lot of NN working on my mental toughness and DT resilience of DT team . Champion athletes and champion teams find a way to deal with obstacles and come out stronger and better . In our first season , PRP engraved DT quote “ football does n’t build character , PRP reveals PRP ” onto DT player medals . This was our mindset approaching all barriers PRP experienced on and off DT field . ” • Do n’t set limitations on what PRP can do . • If PRP scares PRP then PRP means PRP should do PRP . • Do n’t wait for others , be DT first and VB for PRP . • PRP ’s okay if PRP do n’t VB DT rules , all DT girls on my team WDT started did n’t VB DT rules , and never even watched a game before . I do n’t define my success or highlights by on field success . I VBP sport plays a bigger role in an athlete ’s life off DT field . For me , PRP has allowed me to grow in strides – taught me discipline , resilience and leadership skills . PRP has been an incredible journey , with JJ achievements , milestones and experiences WDT will stay with me forever . At DT moment , my main highlight is still to come . I am chasing a big dream to make DT AFLW , until then – helping my team , DT Auburn Giants win a premiership . ” “ I ’ll keep working hard , putting my best foot forward in striving for selection in DT AFLW . PRP never VBP what can happen . I ’m RB currently coaching our under 18s girls , so coaching might be another possibility for me in DT future . DT final avenue I might explore is in research , as I ’m currently completing my PhD in perceptual cognitive skills and decision making for DT GWS Giants . """

DT bones and joints in DT feet experience wear and tear , so conditions WDT cause damage to DT foot can directly affect its NN . This article outlines DT basic anatomy of DT foot bones , along with some of DT most common conditions affecting these bones . DT human foot consists of 26 bones . These bones fall into three groups : DT tarsal bones , metatarsal bones , and phalanges . DT tarsal bones are a group of seven bones WDT make up DT rear section of DT foot . • DT talus , or ankle bone : DT talus is DT bone at DT top of DT foot . PRP connects with DT tibia and fibula bones of DT lower leg . • DT calcaneus , or heel bone : DT calcaneus is largest of DT tarsal bones . PRP sits below DT talus and plays an essential role in supporting body weight . • DT tarsals : These five bones form DT arch of DT midfoot . PRP are DT medial , intermediate , and lateral cuneiforms , DT cuboid , and DT navicular . DT metatarsal bones are a group of five tubular bones in DT middle of DT foot . PRP connect to DT tarsal bones and DT phalanges . DT metatarsals sit in a row , and doctors number them CD to five . DT first NN sits closest to DT arch of DT foot , and number five sits at DT outer edge of DT foot . DT phalanges are DT bones in DT toes . DT second to fifth toes each contain three phalanges . From DT back of DT foot to DT front , doctors call them DT proximal , middle , and distal phalanges . DT big toe or hallux contains only two phalanges , which are proximal and distal . DT metatarsal phalangeal joints are DT joints between DT metatarsals and DT proximal phalanx of each toe . These joints form DT ball of DT foot . DT first metatarsal phalangeal joint sits in line with DT big toe . PRP is a common area for foot pain and other problems . Common conditions affecting DT bones of DT feet include : Arthritis can affect JJ different bones within DT feet , but most commonly causes problems with DT joints at DT base of DT big toe . This type of arthritis is known as big toe arthritis . Doctors MD refer to PRP as hallux limitus or hallux rigidus . Big toe arthritis occurs when cartilage in DT joint of DT big toe begins to wear away . This can happen as a result of JJ NNS of repetitive upward movement of DT joint . Certain activities , such as prolonged running and walking , can increase a person ’s risk of developing arthritis in this area . • pain , stiffness , and swelling in DT big toe • metatarsalgia , or pain and inflammation in DT ball of DT foot A bunion is a prominent bump on DT inside of DT foot , near DT base of DT big toe . Bunions develop when DT bone at DT base of DT toe — DT first metatarsal — begins to separate from DT bone at DT base of DT second toe — DT second metatarsal . As DT first metatarsal drifts outwards , PRP causes DT big toe to drift toward DT other toes . These processes cause DT bunion to become more prominent . A person with a bunion MD experience pain and discomfort at DT site of DT bunion or underneath DT ball of DT foot . These symptoms MD worsen when walking or standing . NNS who develop bunions tend to compensate by carrying more weight on DT second toe , which can cause calluses to develop . Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis . Although PRP can affect almost any joint in DT body , PRP most commonly affects DT joint at DT base of DT big toe . Gout usually occurs due to a high concentration of uric acid in DT blood . Uric acid is a chemical WDT usually dissolves in DT blood and leaves DT body through DT urine . In NNS with gout , excess uric acid begins to accumulate and form crystals in DT joints . Uric acid crystal deposits can trigger an extreme inflammatory reaction , which causes pain and swelling in DT affected area . A hammer toe is a condition WDT usually affects toes other than DT big toe . Instead of pointing straight out in front , these toes point downward , forming a claw shape . In most NNS , DT condition develops with age . PRP is usually DT result of a muscle imbalance when DT long muscles of DT lower leg overpower DT smaller muscles of DT foot . This imbalance causes DT toes to bend inward . A hammer toe MD cause DT following symptoms : • pain and calluses on DT tops of DT toes due to friction with shoes • pain on DT tips of DT toes due to toes pressing into DT sole of a shoe • metatarsalgia , or pain in DT joints at DT base of DT toes • a sensation WDT feels IN walking on marbles Heel spurs are bony growths WDT develop on DT heel bone , or calcaneus . Although PRP MD cause some discomfort , PRP are rarely painful . However , heel spurs often develop as a result of a condition called plantar fasciitis , which can cause pain . Plantar fasciitis refers to inflammation and thickening of DT plantar fascia , which is DT ligament WDT supports DT arch of DT foot . DT following factors can increase DT risk of developing plantar fasciitis : • tight calf muscles WDT reduce DT foot ’s ability to flex upward • a very high arch in DT foot Plantar fasciitis can cause pain in DT heel or bottom of DT foot when standing or walking . NNS who develop heel spurs without plantar fasciitis are unlikely to experience painful symptoms . Heel spurs affect up to CD in 10 NNS . Of these , only half will experience any pain . Sesamoiditis is inflammation of CD or both sesamoid bones at DT base of DT big toe . DT condition can cause significant pain in this area . Excessive and repetitive weight on DT big toe is DT primary cause of sesamoiditis . Factors WDT increase DT risk of sesamoiditis include a sudden increase in activity levels or a NN in footwear . NNS with sesamoiditis MD experience DT following symptoms : • sharp and often severe pain at DT base of DT big toe • pain and discomfort when walking barefoot or on hard surfaces Stress fractures happen when an area of bone endures excessive and repetitive force . Certain repetitive activities , such as walking and running , can cause microscopic cracks , or microfractures , to develop in DT bone . Ordinarily , DT body can repair these microfractures . However , sometimes DT body is unable to maintain DT rate of repair required to keep up with DT stress on DT foot . When this happens , microfractures can develop into a stress fracture . Certain conditions , such as a lack of thyroid hormone or a deficiency in calcium or vitamin D , can RB undermine DT body ’s ability to heal microfractures . • DT base of DT fifth metatarsal • DT sesamoids of DT big toe DT main symptom of a stress fracture is aching pain in DT affected area of DT foot . DT anatomy of DT foot is highly intricate , consisting of JJ bones , joints , and ligaments . Some NN conditions , injuries , and general wear and tear can all cause or contribute to conditions affecting foot bones . NNS who experience persistent foot pain or notice changes in DT appearance of their feet MD wish to see a doctor ."

DT laboratory , which plans to serve hospitals in DT San Francisco Bay Area , says PRP will be able to process more than 1,000 patient samples a day with a 24 - hour turnaround , Doudna announced Monday . DT lab will ramp up to processing 3,000 samples a day if necessary . “ This is a big , big issue here in DT U.S. , ” VBD Doudna . “ PRP need to ramp up testing very fast . PRP ’s been problematic for various reasons . And so PRP are building and implementing a clinical testing laboratory on DT UC Berkeley campus to do exactly DT . ” DT effort is CD more sign of DT desperation in major metropolitan areas to ramp up testing for DT NN , called SARS - CoV - 2 . Two weeks ago , DT U.S. had only processed 42,000 tests over DT course of DT NN pandemic , according to DT NNP Tracking Project , a volunteer effort . As of this week , DT total number of test results returned has risen to nearly 900,000 . Doudna ’s effort is n’t DT first in academia . DT Broad Institute in Cambridge , Mass. , began processing test results last week , and VBD PRP MD be able to process 2,000 tests a day with a 12 - hour turnaround . DT JJ lab is housed at DT University of California , Berkeley ’s Innovative Genomics Institute , where Doudna is DT executive director . PRP is being run by more than 50 volunteers from Berkeley and its environs , including DT chief scientific officer of lab equipment giant Thermo Fisher , team members from Salesforce , DT head of commercial at laboratory information analysis firm Third Wave Analytics , and workers from Hamilton Corp. , a maker of laboratory robots , two of which are used in DT laboratory . “ PRP ’s unbelievable to see how fast this is coming together and NNS writing software just overnight to put such a complicated pipeline in place and ensure IN PRP ’s secure , ” Doudna VBD . “ PRP ’s really quite amazing . ” Doudna VBD IN DT Food and Drug Administration and DT NN of California had been willing to relax normal rules to VB DT effort VBG . DT lab aims to have certification under DT Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( or CLIA ) program , DT federal regulator of diagnostic labs , by next week , at which point PRP will begin testing samples . At first , DT laboratory will test 300 samples at once , at first working with UC Berkeley ’s JJ center . DT effort to develop a test began on March 13 . DT Genomics Institute had been planning to use DT space for experiments involving CRISPR , but PRP already met DT safety specifications a laboratory MD need in order to handle a contagious NN IN SARS - CoV - 2 . DT test is based on DT NNP - CD test developed by ThermoFisher , which has received emergency clearance from regulators . and uses a process to conduct DT polymerase chain reaction , DT basis for all DT widely used tests to detect DT NN . But DT researchers designed a way to use DT test on two Hamilton laboratory robots WDT allowed them to automate DT process . “ DT throughput numbers assume only CD thing : IN Thermo supplies and kits do not run out , ” VBD Fyodor Urnov , DT genomics institute ’s scientific director . He VBD IN DT group has already paid a hefty sum for 10,000 of DT kits .

David Henderson , 39 , ca n’t find smart black shoes WDT fit so he turns up to job interviews in his enormous white Adidas trainers — DT only footwear he can VB into . He says he ’s been stuck on benefits for almost a decade as interviewers do n’t take him seriously because of his NN - up . And to add to his woes , cruel strangers mock him in DT street with taunts IN “ clown shoes ” and “ Sideshow Bob ” . DT fed - up former security guard searched Scotland for a cobbler who MD make him bespoke shoes but drew a blank . He extended his enquiries across DT UK and found a London firm who MD help . But to his horror PRP quoted him a price of £ 1,500 — far beyond his means as his Universal Credit payment leaves him just £ 40 to spend each month after bills . A pair of size CD leather brogues MD cost as much as an eye - watering £ 2,000 . Now he ’s VBG JJ with his problem in DT hope PRP will help him find some decent shoes and VB him off DT dole . David , from Methil , Fife , VBD last night : “ My feet have just got wider over NN and doctors do n’t VB why . “ Employers do n’t believe me when I say I ca n’t buy black shoes but PRP ’s impossible to find affordable ones in my size . “ Some interviewers are bemused when I tell them why I ’m not wearing black shoes . “ Some are surprised and some are sympathetic . But I can tell some of them are thinking ‘ are PRP for real ? ’ “ I feel IN a bit of a tink turning up to job interviews wearing a tracksuit , T - shirt and trainers — but I MD look ridiculous if I was wearing smart clothes and my big white trainers . ” David added : “ PRP ’s been a total nightmare and very embarrassing . I feel IN I have tried everywhere in Scotland but nobody does my size . “ And I VBP NNS making fun of me when I ’m at DT bus stop or walking down DT street NNS say ‘ Wow. look at him .

PRP brings me down and PRP ’s pretty hurtful . “ I just VBP to VB back to work . I ca n’t be DT only person in DT UK with size CD feet . ” David , who is 6ft 2in tall and weighs in at 24 stone , has had big feet since he was youngster . When he left school he was a size 16 . But he MD find shoes WDT fitted him at DT NN and worked in retail , cleaning and security jobs through his 20s . But since then his feet have grown three sizes and are almost 12in long and 7in wide . David says he has been turned down by at least ten employers since he last worked . His worried girlfriend Annie Jones , 32 , VBD she hopes he can resolve DT situation and land a job . Annie VBD : “ NNS laugh at him . PRP point at him and call him names . PRP ’s mean when PRP call him “ clown shoes ” and PRP gets him down . "" I hope he can VB back to work .

While this distance is no cause for concern , 1998 OR2 is continuing on its 3.7 - NN orbit around DT sun , venturing into DT asteroid belt beyond Mars and circling back inside NNP ’s orbit with each lap . On its next approach to our NN in 2078 , PRP will be much closer , swinging within about a million miles of NNP . After a few hundred NNS , astronomers can’t calculate exactly where 1998 OR2 will be . NASA classifies anything over 140 meters ( about 459 feet ) wide WDT passes within five million miles of NNP as a potentially hazardous asteroid . “ Five million miles comes from how much orbits can VB over NN , and a little bit of a margin put on PRP , of course , to be sure IN PRP capture anything WDT might be a potential impact hazard in DT future , ” Johnson says . In just seven NNS , another huge asteroid called 1990 MU , nearly two miles wide , will pass within three million miles of NNP . “ PRP do n’t VB to VB hit by something WDT big , ” Johnson says . “ Our most important task is finding them and getting a fuller catalogue of everything WDT ’s out RB , so PRP do n’t VB surprised . ” In 1998 , DT U.S. Congress directed NASA to detect and characterise at least 90 percent of potentially hazardous asteroids measuring CD kilometre ( about 3,200 feet ) across or larger . Seven NNS later , DT space agency was directed to find 90 percent of nearby asteroids WDT are 500 feet wide or larger . DT bigger asteroids , including 1998 OR2 and 1990 MU , MD devastate life across DT NN if PRP hit . “ PRP is estimated IN asteroids of CD kilometre or more MD result in continent - wide devastation , and DT dust injected into DT atmosphere MD cause drastic cooling and DT possibility of JJ crop failures for at least a few NNS , ” says Jay Melosh , a geophysicist at Purdue University . PRP ’ve found roughly 900 of these larger objects , or 95 percent of DT estimated total population . None are even remotely likely to hit DT NN in DT next several centuries . But of DT smaller group , which MD still destroy cities , PRP ’ve only detected roughly 30 percent of DT estimated 25,000 objects , according to a report from DT National NNP and Technology Council . “ These smaller ones — DT sub - JJ sizes WDT are capable of causing regional problems — PRP still have a lot of work to do , ” Mainzer says . “ Searching for these gray or black rocks against DT blackness of space — PRP ’s just a hard problem . ” Even space rocks smaller than 500 feet wide can be extremely dangerous . Some meteors explode in DT sky with DT strength of nuclear bombs , such as CD WDT burst over Chelyabinsk , Russia , in 2013 . At only 66 feet wide , this fireball meteor caused a shock wave WDT hit DT city , shattering glass and resulting in about 1,500 injuries . No NN saw PRP coming . When PRP comes to stopping an asteroid from colliding with NNP , warning NN is DT name of DT game . With NNS or even decades to prepare , humans MD nudge even DT largest asteroids off course . NASA ’s DART mission , scheduled for launch in July 2021 , will test CD strategy by slamming a half - tonne spacecraft into an approaching asteroid . In October 2022 , about seven million miles from NNP , DT refrigerator - size spacecraft will approach a half - mile - wide asteroid called Didymos , which is orbited by a 500 - foot - wide moon . “ Didymoon , ” as DT smaller body is affectionately called , is DART ’s target . PRP ’s roughly DT size of asteroids WDT can obliterate cities . Ground - based telescopes will be able to detect changes in DT duration of its orbit around DT larger asteroid to measure DT effects of DT impact . “ If PRP was n’t a binary , PRP MD be basically impossible to measure with high precision , ” says Megan Bruck Syal of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , who uses a mix of lab tests and supercomputers to model asteroid impacts . ” This is a remarkable opportunity to test DT effectiveness of DT kinetic impactor technology on a real asteroid . ” Shortly before DART smashes into Didymoon at roughly 14,700 miles an hour , DT spacecraft will release a shoebox - size camera made by DT Italian Space Agency . DT camera will watch as DT spacecraft smashes into Didymoon , taking pictures of DT spray of debris and perhaps even of DT resulting crater . Johnson says he expects DT collision MD decrease DT moon ’s 12 - hour orbit by as much as seven minutes , although DT team will consider DT mission a success if DT NN is at least 70 seconds . “ By changing DT orbit of DT moon , PRP do n’t VB DT orbit of [ Didymos ] , ” Johnson says . “ Didymos is a potentially hazardous asteroid , so PRP do n’t really VB to affect its orbit . PRP do n’t VB to accidentally push PRP DT wrong direction . ” Another spacecraft called Hera , built by DT European Space Agency ( ESA ) , will arrive at DT two asteroids in 2026 to take detailed measurements of DT impact ’s aftermath , as well as test autonomous navigation technologies . Although a “ kinetic impactor ” strategy is well understood , a number of variables control whether DT impact MD successfully deflect an asteroid , Syal says . DT target body ’s composition , strength and structure , how much material is ejected by DT impact , and DT angle at which DT spacecraft comes in are all important factors . “ A ricochet MD be a really poor outcome , meaning a lot of DT momentum is lost , ” Syal says . Kinetic impactors might successfully redirect an asteroid as small as Didymoon , but what about 1998 OR2 ? If something WDT big were on a collision course with NNP , PRP ’d need a bigger strategy , Lu says — such as detonating a nuclear bomb near DT asteroid to vaporize part of its surface and push PRP off course . A nuclear explosion on DT asteroid surface itself MD risk creating a shotgun blast of fragments still heading for NNP . Mainzer , who is leading an effort to launch a space telescope dedicated to finding dangerous asteroids , says DT most optimal deflection strategy depends both on DT incoming object and on how much NN PRP have before impact . To VB what will work , PRP need to practice . “ PRP see this with NN NN , this pandemic , even this [ planetary defence ] problem — a small amount of preparation makes a big difference , ” Mainzer says ."

DT prints were found in a layer of volcanic ash dated by conventional means to be 3.75 million NNS old , and assumed to have been made by a human ancestor . Since this date was IN of DT australopithecine “ Lucy , ” found in 1974 , DT discovery was important indeed . DT prints were discovered and defended by DT recently deceased Mary Leakey ( died December 9 , 1996 , at DT age of 83 ) , Matriarch of DT famous fossil hunting Leakey family , whose finds were extensively publicized and funded by National Geographic Magazine . Mary Leakey was a tireless worker , whose careful research stands as some of DT least controversial in a vicious , ego - laden , funding - driven , field of “ one-upmanship . ” As far as DT footprints VBP , her data are not questioned , but DT interpretation of DT data illustrates DT lengths to which evolutionists will VB to avoid questioning man ’s supposedly evolutionary ancestry . DT prints themselves are quite human - IN “ indistinguishable from those of modem humans ” ( Anderson , NNP Scientist 98:373 , 1983 ) . Following extensive research PRP was concluded IN DT footprints “ resemble those of habitually unshod modem humans … . ( If DT ) footprints were not known to be so old , PRP MD readily conclude IN PRP were made by a member of our genus ” ( Tuttle , Natural History March 1990 ) . Because of DT dates , DT prints have been assigned to Australopithecus afarensis , i.e. , Lucy ’s kind . But is this valid ? Lucy was essentially a chimp . Even discoverer Donald Johansson only claims IN Lucy was a chimp WDT walked somewhat more erect than other chimps . DT Australopithecus foot was an ape ’s foot , with an opposing thumb , and long curved toes just right for climbing in trees , but most unlike a human ’s foot . According to researcher Dr. Charles Oxnard in a 1996 interview : Why do evolutionists continue to maintain IN DT chimp - IN Lucy made DT Laetoli human - JJ footprints , and DT both represent our ancestors ? Well , PRP ’s certainly not for scientific reasons . DT drive to prove man ’s animal ancestry is great , for PRP frees CD from accountability to a creator - God .

And on DT aquatic front , EX 's no bigger mammal than DT blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus ) , which is DT largest known animal to ever grace DT NN . So Exactly How Big Are Blue Whales ? Adam Ratner , a marine scientist with DT DT Marine Mammal Center , confirms IN "" blue whales are DT largest animal on DT NN and DT largest animal identified WDT has been on this NNP . "" No evidence has been found IN any other creature — even DT largest of dinosaurs — surpassed DT blue whale in size . But wait ! What about DT Megalodon , an extinct shark species believed to be DT largest fish on NN NNP ( and which PRP MD recall from DT 2018 horror movie DT Meg ) ? Well , NNS guess IN even DT biggest Megalodon only reached a mere 58 feet ( 18 meters ) ( though some argue PRP was up to 82 feet [ 25 meters ] ) . By contrast , DT largest blue whales clock in at a little more than 100 feet ( 30 meters ) long , and on average are between 75 - 90 feet ( 23 - 27 meters ) in length . DT largest blue whales live in DT Southern Ocean near Antarctica . Care to take a guess at this hefty creature 's weight ? 5 tons ? Nope. 50 ? 100 ? Getting closer , but not quite . DT blue whale weighs approximately 400,000 pounds ( 181,437 kilograms ) , or 200 tons . Ratner shares some other startling facts about DT blue whale 's mass . All these statistics are daunting , but what do blue whales really look IN ? PRP are blue - gray in color — hence DT name , though PRP RB goes by "" sulfur - bottom whale "" due to their yellowish underbelly — with lighter gray patches WDT resemble splotches of paint . DT blue whale is part of DT baleen whale family — a group of toothless whales — and so its mouth "" contains up to 800 plates of short , wide , black baleen or ' whalebone , ' with thick , coarse bristles used for catching food . "" Perhaps surprisingly , female blue whales are usually larger than DT males . Because of their enormous size , you'd be forgiven for thinking IN blue whales must chow down on some pretty big prey , but DT 's actually not DT case . Despite their massive girth , blue whales rely on very tiny , two - inch crustaceans known as krill as their staple meal . And boy , do blue whales eat a lot of krill . Ratner shares WDT "" given their size , blue whales rely on vast quantities of food . Using plates of baleen to filter small zooplankton from DT NN , PRP can consume up to six tons , or 12,000 pounds ( 5,443 kilograms ) of krill each day . "" He continues , "" In CD gulp , DT blue whale can take in 125 percent of its body weight of NN and krill ( 250 tons ) . DT is half a million calories ! "" Despite all DT hubbub over their hefty size , not much is known about blue whales ' behavior in group settings , though PRP are not believed to be aggressive . "" Very little is known about blue whale social structures . PRP do tend to see blue whales traveling alone or in small groups , "" says Ratner . "" In terms of behavior in DT wild , PRP do n't tend to be very belligerent to each other or other animals , but rather focused on feeding or migrating , but again , behavior during breeding season MD be very different and is still in need of more research . "" But marine biologists are studying CD way IN blue whales communicate with each other : sound . "" Blue whales produce CD of DT loudest sounds in DT animal kingdom , a low rumble WDT can be heard hundreds of miles , and even reported to be thousands of miles away in DT ocean , "" says Ratner . "" Researchers are still unsure of DT meaning of DT vocalizations though , with best guesses being around finding mates or signaling opportunities for mating or feeding . "" Jeff Jacobsen , a marine biologist with DT Noyo Center for Marine NNP , expands on DT sounds of blue whales , which NNS use to estimate whale population size , among other factors . When these whale calls are repeated in a sequence , PRP become known as songs . Only male blue whales sing , however . "" These songs differ by ocean basin , region . Their low frequency calls can be detected at very great distances , depending on ocean conditions , "" says Jacobsen in an email . DT frequency of their songs is affected by noisy conditions caused by objects IN passing ships . Blue whales adjust DT frequency of songs "" by blowing air through their vocal cords at a faster or slower rate , "" according to a NN which was conducted by a group of researchers at Oregon NNP University and published in August , 2017 , after PRP observed a gradual decline in DT frequency of blue whale calls . NNS are still trying to figure out DT meaning of these songs . Though since only males sing , these songs MD be a factor in mating and courtship rituals . If PRP 're curious , PRP can listen to DT sound of blue whales at Blue Whale Vocalization . According to Ratner , female blue whales give birth to a single baby calf every two to three NNS , following an 11 - month pregnancy or gestation period . These blue whale babes typically are a whopping 25 - feet - long ( around 8 - meters -long ) and weigh 7,000 pounds ( 3,175 kilograms ) , which is heavier than a mid-size SUV . "" DT milk from their mothers is so nutritious IN DT calves gain 200 pounds ( 90 kilograms ) a day nursing , "" says Ratner . Little is known about how blue whales mate , however . "" Mating behavior is still being studied , though so far PRP seems IN males defend females from other males . PRP see impressive surface behaviors during DT fall of two males ' fighting ' for a female , "" says Jacobsen . John Calambokidis , a co-founder of DT nonprofit Cascadia Research and research biologist who has conducted extensive studies on DT movement of blue whales , expands on DT whales ' possible mating habits , including how PRP communicate and socialize with each other : "" CD feature of blue whales is DT extremely loud calls PRP make , and PRP have recently discovered these very loud calls are produced only by males , indicating PRP plays some role in mating or competition with other males . "" He notes IN blue whales will RB form male - female pairs during mating season — notably , with DT female leading DT pair . Competition for mates can RB VB a little intense , apparently . "" EX is RB a competition involving high speed swimming WDT occurs when more than CD male is involved , "" says Calambokidis . How JJ Are EX and Are PRP Endangered ? A blue whale 's average lifespan is 80 - 90 NNS . However , their existence is increasingly under threat . Blue whales are currently listed as endangered under DT Endangered Species Act . As commercial whale hunting took off in DT early 1900s , blue whales dropped from a pre-whaling population of 250,000 to an estimated 10,000 - 25,000 individuals alive presently , according to Ratner . Calambokidis , says IN "" DT [ blue whale ] population is still under 5 percent of what PRP was prior to whaling , with most of this decrease from DT Southern Hemisphere where blue whales were most numerous . "" Jacobsen agrees , and says IN , "" for some reason blue whales were not as impacted by whaling along DT [ California ] coast and PRP have at least 2,000 individuals here . DT population is still recovering around Antarctica . "" Jacobsen describes how whales still remain highly vulnerable to collisions with ships , which is how DT Noyo blue whale — whose skeleton is being restored at DT Noyo Center — was killed . "" For example , PRP seems IN when EX are more krill in DT shipping lanes , more whales VBP hit , "" says Jacobsen , citing an article by Oregon NNP University 's Whale Telemetry Group . Other challenges facing DT blue whale include entrapment in fishing gear and NN NN affecting DT mammal 's food sources . But EX are some organizations working to make habitats safer for blue whales . Ratner says IN DT Marine Mammal Center has addressed policies about changing shipping lanes in DT San Francisco Bay in order to reduce DT likelihood of boats impacting migrating whales . He RB suggests IN "" individuals around DT NN can make a huge difference by examining their carbon footprint , and working within their communities ( neighborhoods , schools , work ) to reduce their use of fossil fuels IN coal , oil and natural gas for NN and transportation , as well as reducing their use of single - use plastics , CD of DT most commonly found items of ocean trash WDT can pose a threat of entanglement or ingestion for large whales . "" IN JJ marine mammals , blue whales migrate as DT seasons VBP , but PRP can find them all over DT globe . Ratner says IN "" Blue whales are found in all oceans , minus DT Arctic , and can be found both on coastal shelves and deep , oceanic waters . "" DT whales typically migrate toward DT North and South poles , traversing "" into colder waters in DT summer to feed , while migrating back towards DT equator into warmer waters in DT winter to [ breed ] , "" says Ratner . But Calambokidis adds IN blue whales ' migration patterns are slightly more flexible than other baleen whales , IN DT gray whale . This is mainly because blue whales are always in search of food to satisfy their large appetites , so their movements are geared more toward finding food sources than adhering to strict migratory paths . Although EX are a number of distinct blue whale populations , PRP can broadly be grouped into those WDT reside in DT Northern Hemisphere and those WDT are found in DT Southern Hemisphere . CD of DT larger populations in DT Northern Hemisphere is DT estimated 2,000 - something blue whales WDT feed off DT coast of California and migrate to Costa Rica and Mexico , according to DT Marine Mammal Center 's website . "" Despite being so large , much of their specific movements and behaviors are still unknown to NN , though , "" says Ratner of blue whales . PRP 's RB somewhat difficult to track them , because DT satellite tagging WDT PRP might use on other marine mammals — IN NN lions — MD cause skin infection in whales . NNS studying whales will often use a more basic photo identification system to keep track of specific blue whales around DT NN . "" Blue whales , much IN JJ other whales , have unique markings on their skin and can be individuals can be identified by examining photos of whales in different areas of DT NN providing PRP a sense of their migration pattern and life history , "" says Ratner . And , for some good NN , according to DT IUCN Red List of Threatened Species , blue whale numbers have likely gone up in recent decades . So , things seem to be looking up for DT blue giant ."

So what PRP are about to experience is not only DT Galactic superwave , but a cosmic shift on DT scale never experienced since DT creation of DT universe . DT Galactic Central sun is becoming more active even at subluminal speeds , as DT signal of DT previous galactic superwave traveling with DT speed of Light is perfectly entrained with DT JJ NN WDT is coming extremely soon : This is already creating big changes in our Solar system . DT Cosmic Central race has created a multidimensional flower of life grid throughout DT Solar system WDT extends from lunar obit outwards to DT heliopause . This grid will serve as transmission buffer for DT coming superwave . In their last ditch effort to prevent DT shift , DT Chimera group have filled DT Solar system with as much anomaly and darkness as possible from early 2017 to January 21st , 2019 . Since 2012 , DT Chimera was leading a strong war against DT Resistance and actually managed to fool DT Resistance a few times by arranging leaks of incorrect intel to them . For example , DT Resistance was scanning DT Solar system for any remaining Chimera ships and found none , when in fact those ships were hiding in hyperdimensional wormholes and later staged massive surprise attacks . This disnfo campaign has a few times lead to some inconsistencies WDT were posted on this blog . Yet I need to say IN Resistance was releasing true intel to best of their understanding and ability , and overall most of intel PRP have released is valid and correct . Now Resistance is recovering from all those attacks and a JJ reinforcement of 50 million JJ members has arrived from Kuiper belt into DT underground network , membership now totaling 120 million . More reinforcements are expected to arrive soon as PRP come closer to DT shift . DT Chimera has realized IN PRP have lost DT Solar system and are now concentrated on defending NN NNP and sublunar space as their last fortress . PRP are still using toplet plasma bombs as their last line of defense . Top quarks can eat ordinary matter even more efficiently than strange quarks and are far more dangerous than strange quarks : DT plan of Chimera is now to spin limited disclosure into a fake Draco alien invasion WDT MD use TR3 - B spacecraft attacking DT surface of DT NN and DT Cabal using DT NNP Space Command as defense against DT TR3 - B fleet : In DT ensuing chaos , DT Jesuits MD crash DT financial system and implement an AI dystopian surface civilization , similar to what was existing throughout DT Solar system in JJ colonies : In DT last few weeks , certain key positive developments have happened WDT have effectively stopped this Chimera - Jesuit plan and PRP will NOT be successful . DT Light Forces have asked to step up DT frequency of Flower of Life meditation to every 4 hours in order to stabilize DT planetary situation , for those WDT feel guided to participate : Disclaimer : PRP at Prepare for NN ( PFC ) bring PRP information WDT is not offered by DT mainstream NN , and therefore MD seem controversial .

But MD PRP hope IN DT dawn of reason and freedom of thought in these NNP NNPS will do away with this artificial scaffolding , and restore to PRP DT primitive and genuine doctrines of this most venerated reformer of human errors . – Thomas Jefferson , Letter to John Adams , April 11 , 1823 No NN else holds or has held DT place in DT heart of DT NN which Jesus holds .

Jesus ’ resurrection forever changed Christians ’ view of death . Rodney Stark , sociologist at DT University of Washington , points out IN when a major plague hit DT ancient Roman Empire , Christians had surprisingly high survival rates . Why ?

DT much - anticipated battle of Idlib will commence soon . DT plan to liberate every inch of Syria , which has been stated numerous times by NNP Bashar Al Assad , is underway . RT NNS , “ Syrian forces are gearing up to take DT last terrorist stronghold . DT NNP is boosting its military presence , and Russia is warning of a false - flag chemical attack . RT looks at DT alignment of forces ahead of DT battle for Idlib . American warships , cruise missile delivery systems , strategic bombers and other hardware have arrived in DT Mediterranean and in DT Persian Gulf earlier this week . Washington is denying IN any buildup is taking place , but Moscow says DT assets are being gathered for a massive strike against DT Syrian NN . ” DT Syrian NNS have been through unimaginable circumstances , brought on by a western manufactured insurrection , both on DT ground and in DT NN . PRP MD VB , IN bringing this war to an end , and allowing Syrians to rebuild their lives , MD be an objective shared by all humanitarians and activists , but unfortunately , DT is far from DT case . Propagandists who pose as humanitarians and activists , while ironically supporting terrorist aligned militant groups , have once again amplified their coordinated NN efforts to spread misinformation ahead of DT final big battle in Syria . Journalist and book author Brandon Turbeville writes , “ As mainstream NN doubles down in its coordinated propaganda against DT Syrian NN and in support of direct Western military intervention , DT alternative NN has been VBG up against unprecedented censorship on DT part of DT social NN and Internet corporate giants at DT same NN . For DT reason , PRP is becoming harder and harder to find accurate sources of information regarding Syria as well as all other topics in a general Internet search . While readers of DT alt NN before Google ’s purge and censorfest took place have largely remained , DT amount of NNS being exposed to JJ information and an alternative to NN and corporate propaganda has been drastically reduced . ” In order to stay CD step ahead of DT game , Sputnik goes on to say , “ Damascus has handed documents to DT UN , to prove IN al - Nusra Front * terrorists plan to conduct a chemical weapons attack in DT northwestern Syrian province of Idlib and point DT finger at DT country 's NN , according to Syria 's UN envoy Bashar Jaafari . ” Kester Ratcliff a “ Former Project Researcher at University of Bristol ” who studies “ Top Programme Evolutionary Biology MSc at RUG Groningen ” and has previously studied “ Animal Behaviour and Welfare NNP at University of Bristol ” , according to his Facebook page , has created what he calls a “ references directory on 151 JJ figures who have expressed support and / or whitewashed DT Assad regime , with examples and references . ” He stated , “ DT purpose of this list is to facilitate finding DT references to see and to show NNS who genuinely do n’t VB what is true and who to trust about Syria why DT NNS on this list should not be trusted as sources . ” Let ’s take a moment to digest DT last quite bold sentence . DT NNS he cherry picked for his directory should not be trusted according to Ratcliff . Ratcliff dedicated a substantial amount of NN and effort to smearing Vanessa Beeley who has extensive experience working on - DT - ground in Syria . In his directory he VBZ “ PRP is my honest opinion IN she is manifestly an agent of DT Assad regime , IN she should be added to DT lists of sanctioned persons under DT UK and DT EU sanctions on Syria , and IN she should be arrested if she enters DT UK or any EU Member NNP ’s territorial jurisdiction and charged with direct and publicly broadcast incitement of DT crime against humanity of widespread and systematic attacks on humanitarian workers in an armed conflict zone , under Article 7 ( 1 ) ( k ) of DT Rome Statute of DT International Criminal Court . She responded to Ratcliff ’s tweet , with DT question on everyone ’s mind “ Who are PRP ? ” In 1978 , a popular English rock band by DT name of “ DT Who ” released a song titled Who Are PRP ? CD of DT lines is , “ I remember throwing punches around and preaching from my chair ” . What oddly perfect description of Ratcliff , who makes accusations against NNS he has never met , talked to , or even interacted with , all from DT comfort of his chair . Others on social NN asked questions such as what expertise does Ratcliff bring to DT table ? How qualified is he to tell a broad audience who is trustworthy and who is not when PRP comes to DT Syrian conflict ? I am paraphrasing but DT point is DT same . PRP might imagine , IN this self - proclaimed “ political thinker ” ( per his Medium bio ) must have a background WDT qualifies him to give an opinion on journalists , political commentators , and other JJ figures who have contributed written or oral material during DT course of over seven NNS of a western manufactured insurrection in Syria . However , DT questions certainly outnumber DT answers in this case . What PRP can gather is IN Ratcliff has never stepped foot in Syria , and relies on second - hand information , such as DT from refugees whom he met and coached during his NN in Greece . DT ever - evolving man of JJ interests Ratcliff gives PRP more insight into who he is in DT few articles he has written and published on various sites . In an essay published by Medium titled “ Suffering and DT Construction of Authority ” Ratcliff wrote about his mother "" I had a mentally ill and abusive mother , grew up as effectively her sole carer . During my teenage NNS , DT most fundamental issue PRP fought about and DT most frequently was IN she demanded I should ‘ respect her authority ’ merely because of her conventional position as my parent , which I MD not do because she was actually completely untrustworthy , unreliable and , literally , insane , and in fact I had to practically care for her IN a parent MD , when I was a child . Practically our roles were reversed , but she insisted on DT ‘ authority ’ conventionally attached to her position . Needless to say , I absolutely refused . ” Ratcliff goes on to say , “ DT developmental experience made me extra sensitive , vigilant and radically opposed to all forms of authoritarianism in every area of human life . ‘ Authoritarianism ’ is DT idea of ‘ authority ’ existing for its own sake , inherently possessing its authority , in an alienated way , rather than PRP being a characteristic of a relationship , in which authority is given and received ( inter - subjectively ) for certain mutually beneficial purposes . "" PRP can read more about his views on authority in his essay on Medium where his bio reads : EvoBio MSc student at RUG in Groningen , refugee solidarity volunteer , activist , political thinker . Ratcliff shares with PRP DT next chapter of his life in DT same essay , He wrote about his Buddhist monk experience for Buddha Channel in an article titled Kester Ratcliff — ” Monastic lineages and DT Vinaya : Which is Buddhist ? ” ” I used to be a monk for six and half NNS in DT Thai Forest Tradition , my name then was Bhikkhu Santi . As well as a lot of meditation , in those six NNS I RB did a lot of NN and particularly Vinaya , and especially DT two main neglected areas - DT Bhikkhuni Vinaya and DT communal legal procedures ( adhikarana - samatha - dhammas ) . Ratcliff shares an interestingly similar perspective about DT abbots , as DT of his mother in DT same article . Ratcliff writes about his experience as a monk and how his journey led him to join DT Quakers in an article on his website titled “ Mulesika - Seeking DT Roots ” . - Ratcliff wrote an article titled Systemic legal issues for refugees in Europe and affected by Europe globally in which he VBZ this is “ A list of in - depth sources with connecting notes about DT major systemic legal problems confronting refugees as PRP try to reach a place of safety . DT major issues are in order of encounter from a refugee ’s point of view . ” - On Ratcliff ’s Facebook profile PRP VBZ IN he manages a group called Visas for Asylum or Safe Passage to EU . - Ratcliff writes about his work with HIAS on his blog Silence of Eternity : Specifically what I plan to do in Chios next week and DT week after : • Help physically set up DT information tent – I ’m not sure whether to take my power tools as well as my legal textbooks , but I have both here ; • Try to set up a psychosocially safe , private and dignified environment in which to ask NNS to recall what happened to make them flee their homes and NNS ; • Discuss with them through DT Guide I ’ve prepared on how to prepare for asylum interviews , clarify their answers with them , and write down their statements ready for them to take in with them to their interviews ( this should assist both DT refugees and EASO / DT Greek Asylum Service , making DT process both fairer and more efficient for everyone ) . • If EX ’s enough NN , practice mock interviews with NNS . • Connect NNS whose NNS I can’t deal with as a non-lawyer to DT network of pro bono refugee legal aid lawyers I ’m in contact with now , across NGOs . • VB a more detailed realistic sense of what ’s needed and what works , to feed into DT design of DT HIAS Greece legal aid programme . ” - Ratcliff wrote a comment in response to an article written by DT Sun titled “ SYRIA CRIME WAVE : Hundreds of Syrians in UK arrested over string of offences including rape and child abuse , in which he stated DT sole purpose of sharing this article and Ratcliff ’s comment is to show IN his calls for NNS to be convicted and imprisoned are nothing JJ . In response to an article titled “ Spiritual influence ” and elections Ratcliff wrote “ ... DT duty to vote and participate in social democracy is a serious JJ duty which RB ought to be considered a religious obligation . "" Ratcliff is in his final - NN as an undergrad student of Animal Behaviour & Welfare NNP at Bristol University in DT Veterinary Sciences School . His current dissertation project revolves around modelling how parasites influence DT collective movement patterns WDT emerge in sheep flocks , using comparative evidence from research in fish . This brief history based on JJ information WDT Ratcliff has generously offered via multiple NN platforms might give PRP some insight about him , but leaves PRP with more questions than answers . Why has a relatively unknown individual in DT Syrian conflict , taken on this task of quietly collecting information on 151 NNS , and placing a target on each and every CD of their backs ? Ratcliff VBZ on a Facebook post IN this is his “ contribution to DT war ” . DT ’s an important point to take note of . Ratcliff is feeling DT euphoric effects of overnight fame , but has RB made PRP clear IN he does not VB NNS to focus on him as a person or his typos or his lack of credentials . No , PRP MD be best to just blindly accept everything he has stated , without giving PRP much thought . Ratcliff knew IN this directory MD cause a storm of backlash based on some of his facebook posts . Ratcliff had DT help of a retired lawyer friend , and two journalists WDT helped check his “ monster article "" , in addition he checked PRP himself a “ bazillion "" times and remarkably still managed to misspell a number of names and VB JJ facts wrong . Ratcliff does n't VB this to be about him , he says “ PRP ’s not really about me "" . Filled to DT Brim with Errors , Misspellings , and Inaccuracies Ratcliff takes a lot of pride in his directory . On Facebook , he stated , “ I have checked PRP very carefully , and endeavored to be fair . Despite hating them , I will not remove anyone or VB what I have VBN about them , in spite of any amount of harassment , so do n't even bother trying , but if EX is any real factual inaccuracy I will of course immediately correct PRP . ” Notice how much emotion he expresses towards those he has chosen to blacklist . He does n’t merely disapprove of their viewpoints , but he hates them as individuals . Emotions can certainly cloud a person ’s judgment , and by DT looks of PRP , Ratcliff has no reservations sharing his feelings publicly about individuals whom he has never met or interacted with for DT most part . DT hate he mentions must have developed during DT NN IN he was lurking in DT background , watching and taking notes of who should make his list of untrustworthy sources , as he refers to them . Ratcliff wrote in a JJ Facebook post on his page about DT typos . For someone who claims to have checked his directory “ very carefully , ” PRP sure was filled to DT brim with inaccuracies , and even NNS ’s names were misspelled . Their very identity was wrong . If Ratcliff does n’t care much for spelling NNS ’s names correctly what else has he not given much thought to in his directory ? Medium has served as a platform for a number of Ratcliff ’s essays and incoherent drivel . Here are just two examples of Ratcliff ’s literary balderdash : - Example of OSINT on 21stcenturywire Vanessa Beeley ’s latest Assadist propaganda against DT White Helmets - which Ratcliff NNP is “ an incomplete draft from 22 June 2017 . I ’m publishing PRP now just in order to send PRP to another researcher . ” He RB VBZ “ CD of Vanessa Beeley ’s useful idiots challenged me to “ prove PRP ” — obviously PRP wo n’t read this or VB about PRP or stop repeating lies , because PRP do n’t believe in objective factual truth , but for DT record , here is some proof ” . - Definition and discussion of DT meaning and importance of ‘ Bullshit ’ . He VBZ “ I wrote this long definition and discussion of ‘ bullshit ’ to enable me to write a much shorter and simpler paragraph defining PRP in a major article later . ” His latest contribution has since been suspended by Medium . Their reasons for suspension can be seen in DT following tweet . According to Merriam Webster DT definition of a sadist is CD characterized by sadism : a person who takes pleasure in inflicting pain , punishment , or humiliation on others . Sadism is defined as DT derivation of sexual gratification from DT infliction of physical pain or humiliation on another person . This clarifies why some choose to use DT slur Assadist rather than simply saying Pro-Assad when insulting those who have committed CD or more of DT following “ crimes ” : 3. speaking up against foreign intervention , imperialism , and terrorism 4. and lastly DT most contentious of all according to characters such as Ratcliff ... wait for PRP ... actually supporting DT elected NN of Syria ! NNP Bashar Al Assad :: horrifying gasp : : If these reasons truly qualify CD to be called an Assadist then Ratcliff should have included DT millions of NNS around DT NN who support DT legitimate NN of Syria Dr. Bashar Al Assad . Of course using DT term Assadist is not original or creative on Ratcliff ’s part , nor is he DT first to create such a ridiculous list , which MD RB have dangerous ramifications for those on PRP . Others have tread these murky waters before Ratcliff , just google Assadist and PRP ’ll see a selection of unimpressive ramblings . - Louis Proyect wrote about Assadists on his blog DT Unrepentant Marxist . In CD of his entries titled Young Assadist Academics Nursing their Wounds he stated DT following “ CD of DT most depressing things about DT six NNS of war in Syria , besides DT obvious destruction of life and property , is DT trail of intellectual damage left behind by investigative journalists , leftist leaders , and academics who bend DT truth or outright lie in order to defend DT mafia NN . History will certainly remember NNS such as Seymour Hersh , Theodore Postol , and Tariq Ali as being ethically and intellectually challenged no matter how virtuous PRP were in DT past . ” PRP ca n’t help but wonder if Ratcliff MD be Proyect ’s protégé ? Either way , whether he is or not , does n’t matter much , but PRP is interesting to see DT similarities between DT two , especially their love of using DT same slurs and list - making passion . What a useful tool their contributions must be to terrorist aligned opposition groups who are seeking to shut down dissenters especially during this last phase of a war ... which PRP have clearly lost . Ratcliff has been sharing articles written in response to his directory on his social NN accounts with uber - enthusiasm . Overnight fame can be exhilarating and Ratcliff is enjoying every millisecond of his five minutes of fame . Ratcliff ’s greatest accomplishment thus far , MD very well be getting DT attention of RT which resulted in not CD , but three articles being published in a span of two days , in response to his Assadist directory . - August 27th : Chomsky , Hersh and ... Boris Johnson ? Twitter pundits ponder odd ' Assadist ' blacklist “ An obscure blog post , WDT accuses journalists and intellectuals of inciting “ crimes against humanity ” for their views on Syria , has received glowing reviews from verified Twitter pundits , despite its factually dubious claims . Featured on an unfrequented Medium blog , DT “ International Assadists References Directory ” lists 151 NNS and organizations who have allegedly “ expressed support and / or whitewashed DT Assad regime . ” DT eclectic compilation of “ Assadists ” features individuals and groups of all political stripes and backgrounds , from DT Greek nationalist political party Golden Dawn to Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters . Notable journalists such as Seymour Hersh , John Pilger , Peter Hitchens , Glenn Greenwald and Patrick Cockburn are RB listed as reckless Assad apologists . ” - August 28th : Do n’t tell him , Pike ! DT laughable ( yet sinister ) list of ‘ International Assadists ’ Neil Clark wrote “ A newly - compiled directory of 151 ‘ International Assadists ’ is both hilarious - for all DT mistakes in PRP , but disturbing too , as PRP represents a McCarthyite attempt to police DT debate on Syria . ” He goes on to say “ By Ratcliff ’s own admission PRP do n’t even have to be ‘ pro - Assad ’ to be included in his ‘ International Assadists ReferenceDirectory ’ . His definition of ‘ Assadist ’ is incredibly wide - so wide in fact IN PRP even includes those who have supported air strikes on Syrian NN targets . Here he quotes Ratcliff as having written “ All pro-Assad NNS are Assadists ( PRP repeat Assadist propaganda claims ) , but not all Assadists are in their own view pro-Assad , ” he explains in DT introduction . In other words , if PRP repeat anything on Syria IN he regards as an “ Assadist propaganda claim ” , PRP ’re an Assadist . Even if PRP make PRP clear PRP strongly oppose DT Syrian NN - and support bombing Syrian airfields , IN former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson , who is listed . ” - August 28th ‘ Assadist list ’ nothing more than McCarthyism paired with ‘ hoodwink ’ NN George Galloway wrote “ Yet I have made DT Assadist List , compiled by a student scribbler , a Kester Ratcliff , whose name need n’t detain PRP for long . He is his masters ’ voice and his masters are whom PRP should focus on . ” Responses from some of DT “ Assadists ” in Ratcliff ’s directory PRP mean DT regurgitation of already written , unoriginal , logical fallacy and patent lies based smears prior ? Yes , seems Kester is looking for an opening with NATO 's Atlantic Council or # Bellingcrap . — Eva Bartlett ( @EvaKBartlett ) August 27 , 2018 Even aside from DT partisan slander and ludicrous allegations , EX are JJ blatant errors / lies in this blacklist ( eg , PRP falsely claims journalists are working for NN outlets PRP in fact do n't work for ) . @Brian should be ashamed for endorsing this malicious garbage . — Ben Norton ( @BenjaminNorton ) August 24 , 2018 PRP seems IN @KesterRatcliff who claims to be a "" human rights activist "" is not only a horrible blogger but MD be mentally unstable and possibly dangerous person . pic.twitter.com/VcNaDOvJzn — Kevork Almassian ( @KevorkAlmassian ) August 30 , 2018 If poppycock is n’t your literary preference , and PRP have an appetite for truthful , honest reporting and journalism , might I suggest PRP read DT following refreshing list of sources WDT have covered DT war in Syria in JJ different capacities . Brandon Turbeville is an exceptional journalist and accomplished author of seven books . Turbeville has first - hand experience from visiting Syria which only adds to DT verity of his articles . Turbeville has published 1000 ’s of articles on a wide variety of subjects including NN , economics , NN corruption , and civil liberties . He has created an incredibly useful directory WDT should be read and shared by those who value DT truth : PRP VBP A Real List ? Directory Of Accurate Alt NN Sources On Syria . Turbeville wrote “ ... with disturbed “ researchers ” and various shadowy organizations creating silly lists of “ Assadists ” “ Fake NN , ” and “ Russian propaganda , ” I thought PRP might be useful to create a list of my own , containing a number of DT same names , in order to provide a list of researchers , journalists , and activists who have been working to expose DT true agenda behind what is happening in Syria today in hopes IN my readers will RB find their work and find access to additional sources of information which certainly will not be available in DT mainstream press . This , of course , is in addition to my own work . ” To conclude on a positive note , DT reality on DT ground shows IN DT foreign - backed militants have failed miserably in their pursuit of unseating NNP Assad and completely leveling DT jasmine - scented country . DT will of DT Syrian NNS has proven to be stronger than bombs and propaganda . In a last - ditch effort to shift DT outcome of this war , misguided mouthpieces and paid propagandists alike will make a lot of noise , but DT ’s really all PRP is . Their futile attempts at prolonging DT war by demonizing NNS PRP disagree with is nothing more than a distraction . Ultimately their actions cannot and will not disturb DT unrivaled unity of DT majority of DT Syrian NNS ."

Word came on NNP 28 IN DT small but mighty startup Bigfoot Biomedical has bought up DT key assets of Asante Solutions , DT California company WDT made DT click - together and partially - disposable Snap insulin pump but announced just two weeks ago IN PRP was closing up shop for good after being unable to secure sufficient funding . DT NN of Asante 's demise rocked DT Diabetes Community , catching pretty much everyone off - guard -- from current and potential pump customers , to healthcare providers and even most of Asante 's own employees and sales reps . Now , Bigfoot Biomedical , DT exciting NNP York startup rumored to be creating CD of DT most ingenious closed loop systems for blood sugar control , is swooping in to buy DT defunct pump maker 's assets -- including DT intellectual property behind DT Snap pump and DT manufacturing infrastructure . No , this does n't mean Bigfoot will continue to make or sell DT Snap pump , or even IN Bigfoot will be involved in servicing any existing pumps out RB . What PRP means is IN DT designs WDT make DT Snap so innovative and unique -- IN quick refills , missed bolus reminders , and disposable parts -- will not be lost , but rather live on in future closed loop technology ! Hey , when CD door closes , another NN opens , right ? If PRP remember , Bigfoot was first formed late last NN ( originally as SmartLoop ) , a result of DT growing do - PRP - yourself mentality among DT diabetes tech community , an initiative known as DT # WeAreNotWaiting movement . Bigfoot 's JJ on DT scene , but DT NNS behind PRP are anything but newbies . DT main trio of talent are all D - Dads --- Jeffrey Brewer , who became CEO of this startup after leading DT JDRF as its CEO for four NNS up until mid-2014 ; Lane Desborough , former chief engineer of insulin delivery at Medtronic Diabetes ; and Bryan Mazlish , a former exec who earned DT nickname "" Bigfoot "" by developing a homemade artificial pancreas system for his T1 wife and young son WDT was shrouded in mystery for over a NN -- prompting a Wired magazine article to refer to its elusive creator as "" Bigfoot . "" See this link to peruse DT rest of DT talent PRP 've brought on board so far , gathering hardware and algorithm skills from all corners of DT healthcare , JJ device and digital tech NN -- such as Medtronic Diabetes hardware and algorithm creators to DT former CFO of Welldoc . PRP seems this ambitious outfit is adding JJ faces at breakneck speed ! Since DT Bigfoot execs came out of DT shadows earlier this NN , PRP 've been raising money to VB off DT ground ; less than a month ago reports stated IN Bigfoot had brought in $ 3.5 million from investors so far , with hopes to raise $ 10 - 15 million by this summer . If all goes well , Bigfoot leaders hope to VB started on pivotal clinical studies of their prototype system in 2016 and start bringing PRP DT first generation of their device in DT few NNS following DT ! PRP 're very proud to announce IN Jeffrey Brewer ( at right , with his son ) will be giving a debut presentation of Bigfoot 's work at our DiabetesMine D - Data Exchange event happening this Friday in conjunction with DT first day of DT ADA Scientific Sessions . PRP 'll share details post - event , but in DT meantime PRP were thrilled to connect with Jeffrey in advance for a quick Q&A about all DT very cool happenings with Bigfoot . Here 's what he tells PRP : DM ) Congrats on DT exciting NN about picking Asante 's technology ! PRP 're bummed to see them fail of course , but glad something positive MD come out of PRP . So what exactly did PRP VB from them , and what will DT impact be ? JB ) Bigfoot Biomedical acquired all DT assets of Asante Solutions . PRP are RB hiring some former employees to support our plans . PRP regret IN PRP are not in a position to support DT existing Snap users at this NN . However , PRP are thrilled IN our efforts to deliver an overall automated insulin delivery system will be greatly accelerated . Does DT leave anything remaining for others to acquire ? No . Per DT transaction , Bigfoot acquired all DT assets of Asante Solutions . Can PRP describe what DT plans are at this point for using Asante Snap technology in what Bigfoot is developing ? Asante created DT Snap as a simple - to - use insulin pump . PRP will be leveraging DT as a component of our broader automated insulin delivery system . DT pump body is likely to stay DT same and be mated with a custom controller WDT will interface with other components of our system . What does your current prototype look IN now , and what can PRP expect to see once this is available ? I MD n't say PRP 's clunky , but some have used DT language to describe DT prototype . Those who 've used PRP quite IN PRP . DT difference between our integrated solution and DT prototype is IN DT prototype uses proprietary fobs and cradles to BLE ( Bluetooth Low NN ) enable an off - DT - shelf insulin pump and sensor . Our insulin pump will be sleeker , easier to use and talk to DT other components of DT system via BLE . How will DT addition of Asante tech impact your development timing and getting into regulatory review ? Having DT Asante Snap platform will significantly accelerate and de-risk our pump development efforts . Our plans are to be in pivotal clinical trials in 2016 . Of course JJ other outfits are RB working on closed loop projects . What are DT challenges in moving all of these different choices forward ? I believe DT only disclosed commercial closed loop development effort is by Medtronic . All DT others of which I 'm aware are still in DT stage of "" proof of concept , "" i.e. academic research , and are being funded by non-profit grants from DT NIH , JDRF , Helmsley or individual donors . CD of DT challenges is IN EX is a lot of misunderstanding about DT difference between a commercial effort and an academic demonstration project . PRP will take tens of millions of dollars for PRP to bring our system to market . Showing something works in a small number of NNS is important . However , PRP 's still just a NN project until EX is a funded entity WDT can build out DT range of operational competencies required to develop , test , market and support a commercial closed loop system . So PRP 's pretty much a race to VB DT first closed loop system completed and to market ? PRP do n't VB being first is what 's important . Getting PRP right , so IN PRP can bring closed loop to DT most NNS at DT lowest cost is our focus . Access to this technology and cost are huge factors ... Given all of Bigfoot 's collective expertise , is EX any sense of how DT cost of your system will compare to pumps and CGMs on DT market now ? While today ’s complex prototypes for “ artificial pancreas ” systems MD strike some as a rich person ’s luxury , PRP intend to deliver an integrated solution WDT costs less than DT sum of all DT bits of technology WDT NNS are using today . Based on our experience , PRP believe our system will be more cost - effective than anything else on DT horizon . Plus PRP will lower costs while RB delivering better outcomes . By working on separate projects , are n't PRP just creating more closed loop "" silos "" WDT do n't connect , instead of open - source platforms WDT can share data -- which DT Diabetes Community has been pushing on for NNS ? At Bigfoot PRP are advocates for bringing down DT silos and making data available to NNS with T1D . However , in order to take DT data and make decisions for NNS with T1D ( such as with an automated insulin delivery system ) EX need to be companies WDT will fund development of a system and take PRP through clinical trials and regulatory submissions . I wish more companies were making DT commitment . I VBP competition is healthy and IN NNS with T1D should have choices . PRP plan to be CD of DT choices . What about truly open - source initiatives in closed loop tech , IN what Dana Lewis and Scott Leibrand are working toward with DT OpenAPS initiative ? I 'm not sure what happens with OpenAPS . However , I applaud those who are pushing PRP forward . Their efforts and advocacy are helping to educate everyone ( FDA , industry , non-profits ) on how desperately these technologies are needed . Thanks for taking DT NN , Jeffrey -- definitely some outstanding progress being made , and PRP can't wait to see what materializes from Bigfoot . ** June 4 , 2015 UPDATE : ** Bigfoot Biomedial announced PRP has signed an agreement with Dexcom allowing for CGM data sharing to be integrated into this future closed loop tech ! *** June 5 , 2015 UPDATE : *** Bigfoot 's CEO Jeffrey Brewer announced during DT D - Data Exchange , held in conjunction with DT American Diabetes Association 's annual meeting , IN PRP MD be moving DT startup from NNP York to Silicon Valley , into DT 45,000 square foot former Asante building where PRP has a manufacturing line ."

DT Apollo program ’s total cost was about $ 25.4 billion , about $ 152 billion in today ’s dollars . DT money flowed to giants IN Boeing ( CD of DT makers of DT Saturn V rocket ) , established brands IN Velcro ( whose fasteners kept things in place in space ) and some unexpected companies IN Hammond Organ ( a keyboard manufacturer WDT created mechanical timers and clocks for DT Apollo spacecraft ) . CD of DT most remarkable things about DT Moon landing was how short a NN PRP took . NNP Kennedy proposed NASA MD land a person on DT moon , and a short eight NNS later , PRP did . DT meant IN PRP accelerated technology development far faster than MD have happened otherwise , says Ella Atkins , an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers senior member . “ DT rapid prototyping and deployment MD have been unprecedented without DT kind of program . ” DT experience gained by companies IN Honeywell and Motorola helped push industries IN avionics and communications decades into DT future . Apollo did n’t just advance technology . PRP advanced DT way business was done . In an article in DT February 1968 issue of Forbes , NASA manager George Mueller explained how he restructured DT large , complex Apollo program into smaller “ packages , ” each with its own manager . DT organizational setup made PRP easier to keep DT project running smoothly , and based on its experience , Boeing copied DT setup when PRP developed DT 747 . Experience with Apollo RB led its contractors to develop JJ kinds of businesses . Black & Decker ( now Stanley Black & Decker ) , for example , took its experience building tools for DT Apollo program into some of DT battery - powered consumer products WDT underlies its $ 14 billion in annual revenue . Plantronics ( now Poly ) uses DT headsets PRP manufactured for DT Apollo mission as DT design basis for headsets PRP makes today for applications ranging from aviation to gaming . Perhaps Malcolm Forbes VBD PRP best , writing in 1968 IN “ our future breakthroughs in knowledge will come from DT exciting disciplines necessary to solve DT problems WDT arise in trying to reach DT Moon and beyond . ” Hundreds of companies helped construct DT Apollo spacecraft WDT sent Neil Armstrong , Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins to DT Moon . Here are a few highlights of what PRP did . All of DT figures here are in contemporary dollars . For a sense of what these figures MD be today , multiply them by about seven . LEFT : Saturn V SA - 506 at DT moment of ignition . ( NASA ) RIGHT : Lunar Module "" Eagle "" composite . ( ED HENGEVELD / NASA ) DT total cost of Project Apollo from 1960 to 1973 .

Cost of DT lunar module , known as DT Eagle . LEFT : Aldrin 's boot print in DT lunar soil . ( NASA ) RIGHT : Neil Armstrong collects lunar soil . ( NASA ) Speed DT astronauts were traveling when DT Apollo spacecraft fired rocket engines from NNP orbit to send them to DT Moon . NN WDT passed between liftoff on NNP to Neil Armstrong first setting foot on DT Moon . Weight of DT rocks and soil WDT Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin brought back from DT lunar surface . Approximate value of those rocks , based on DT reported valuation for Moon rocks in a criminal case against three NASA interns who had stolen Moon rocks stored in a safe at DT Johnson Space Center lab in Houston . DT three thieves were captured by DT FBI thanks to a sting operation with DT help of a Belgian rock collector and eventually pleaded guilty .

RIGHT : Flight controllers Charles Duke ( Capcom ) , Jim Lovell ( backup CDR ) and Fred Haise ( backup LMP ) during DT lunar module descent . ( NASA ) Combined surface area in DT Apollo spacecraft covered with Velcro fasteners . NASA was CD of Velcro ’s early big customers , and its fasteners were used to secure objects in DT spacecraft so PRP MD n’t float around . A special metallic version was RB built by Velcro to secure heat shields to DT spacecraft . Amount NASA spent on private sector service contracts to its facilities in 1968 . Around 28,500 private contractors were working at NASA facilities DT NN . Amount spent by CD of Apollo ’s contractors — North American Rockwell ’s Space Division ( which later became part of Boeing ) — on subcontractors for development during DT Apollo program . Number of reflecting mirrors built for DT Laser Ranging Retroreflector by manufacturers Heraeus and Bendix Corporation . DT retroreflector uses a laser to precisely measure DT distance from DT NNP to DT Moon down to a millimeter . PRP ’s still taking measurements today , which are used to keep GPS satellites synchronized and accurate so PRP do n’t VB lost on your way to a lunch date . Percentage of integrated circuits in DT country WDT were being manufactured specifically for DT computers for DT Apollo program at its peak . Integrated circuits were fairly JJ then , but Apollo spurred on this technology , which computers today depend on . Misson Control in Houston watches Neil Armstrong set foot on DT moon via televised communications . ( NASA ) Value of a NASA contract to Motorola , which built DT data uplink and digital systems for DT Apollo program . PRP was a Motorola - built transponder WDT sent Neil Armstrong ’s “ CD giant leap ” to listeners at home , and DT technology MD form DT basis of DT telecommunications equipment DT company still manufactures today ."

As an insider , he knew Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler DT same occult network WDT wanted war to destroy and demoralize humanity , part of a Master Plan to establish DT Antichrist ( Satan ) as Lord of DT Universe . DT "" Ugly Secret "" of NNP War Two ( Revised from Dec. 7 , 2007 ) Josslyn Victor Hay , 22nd Earl of Erroll , ( 1901 - 1941 ) a senior British colonial ( Kenyan ) official , knew DT real cause of NNP War Two and had DT stature to be heard . Winston Churchill ordered DT Secret Service ( Special Operations Executive ) to kill him . What "" ugly secret "" MD make DT British VB to so much trouble to murder a prominent British colonial politician ? Significantly DT conspirators chose DT codename "" Operation Highland Clearance "" for Erroll 's murder . DT brutal eviction of Scottish tenants from their farms in DT early 1800s is a fitting symbol for DT dispossession of DT human race by DT NNP NNP Order , which DT Second NNP War did so much to advance . DT popular version of DT Nairobi , Kenya murder was depicted in DT 1987 movie "" White Mischief "" starring Charles Dance as Lord Erroll and Greta Scacchi as Diana Broughton . Erroll 's body was found in DT early morning Jan. 24 , 1941 kneeling in DT front passenger footwell of his car with a bullet wound behind DT ear , murdered execution style . Erroll , 40 , a widower , was having an affair with a married woman Diana Broughton and had dropped her at her nearby home after midnight . Suspicion was cast on Diana 's much older husband Sir Henry Broughton , who was tried but acquitted . DT movie pins DT blame on him and DT decadence of DT white settlement in general . DT murder MD have remained unsolved but for a retired SOE insider who , informed of a terminal NN , gave DT information to a colleague Tony Trafford who composed a 100 - page memo . Trafford , since deceased , gave PRP to an author , coincidentally named Errol Trzebinski who was writing "" DT Life and Death of Lord Erroll : DT Truth Behind DT Happy Valley Murder "" ( 2000 ) . ( Text can be found here . ) At 6 foot 2 "" with chiselled Nordic looks , Lord Erroll was a natural leader , heir to an ancient Scottish lineage , organized and intelligent , an excellent speaker with a photographic memory . A member of DT Kenyan colonial legislature , he held DT post of Military Secretary with important military and intelligence duties . SOE "" Operation Highland Clearance "" involved more than 100 NNS . In DT early stages of DT NN war , why was PRP so important for DT Churchill NN to silence this man ? DT GREAT RUSE Essentially , Hitler was not interested in a NN war . His wanted to conquer DT USSR in a "" Nordic "" alliance with England . Erroll belonged to DT "" Cliveden Set "" a powerful section of DT British elite WDT supported this alliance . Churchill 's backers , DT Masonic Jewish - owned Bank of England set Hitler up as a means to control Stalin , have a NN war and destroy Germany once and for all . War enables them to concentrate power and wealth in their own hands and slaughter natural elites who might interfere with NN NN . DT bankers used DT Cliveden types to fool Hitler into thinking England approved of his plans . IN proud proteges , DT Nazis entertained DT English and gave them information on their military build - up . Hitler probably saw himself as a British ally or even an agent . DT Nazis were set up . This is DT real meaning of DT "" Policy of Appeasement . "" DT Cliveden Set divided into two groups , those who were aware of DT trap , and those who were not . Erroll was CD of DT latter who sincerely believed Hitler represented a bulwark to Communism . When DT war broke out , Erroll did his patriotic duty . But he knew too much . He was aware of how Hitler and Churchill belonged to DT same homosexual occult secret society and he MD have VBN this within range of MI - 5 assets . Stalin was a member of DT same Illuminati and helped fund Hitler 's rise . PRP colluded in Barbarosa . DT war was strictly a ruse designed to kill goyim . Errol 's father , Victor Hay , was DT British High Commissioner in DT Rhineland . At age 20 , Errol was DT private secretary to DT British Ambassador in Berlin . He spoke German and French fluently , knew DT Prince of Wales , and was part of DT European elite . His diplomatic career hit DT rocks in 1924 when he married a twice - divorced woman . Idina Sackville , eight NNS his senior . He followed her to Kenya where she had a large estate won in a divorce settlement . PRP had a daughter . Erroll visited England , joined Oswald Mosley 's Fascist party but later quit . He was a close friend of DT Duke of Hamilton who was a linchpin in DT Bank of England 's "" Hitler Project . "" In NNP 1941 , three months after Errol 's death , Rudolf Hess , Deputy Fuhrer , flew to Scotland to present Hamilton with a generous peace proposal . Both men were homosexuals . Hess was Hitler 's homosexual lover in DT Landsberg Prison and helped him compose "" Mein Kampf . "" Hitler was created by a homosexual occult secret society spanning both British and Nazi elites . This was called DT Thule Society in Germany and DT Order of DT Golden Dawn in England . Aleister Crowley 's Ordo Templi Orientis was DT common link . Winston Churchill , a Druid , was part of this occult scene . ( He was RB a friend of Edward VIII , considered a Nazi sympathizer . ) But DT Nazis branch was not aware of DT hidden English agenda . Erroll was silenced because he opposed Communism but knew Hitler was a Judas goat empowered to lead Germany to destruction . He MD give away DT hidden agenda . ( See Churchill 's homosexual connection . ) DT MURDER On Sept 7 , 1940 , a highly placed group including Douglas Douglas - Hamilton , DT Fourteenth Duke of Hamilton , met in Scotland and decided to terminate Josslyn Hay , Lord Erroll . DT matter was to be handled by SOE Cairo station . Jock and Diana Broughton left were MI - 5 assets who entered Kenya in Nov. 1940 to discover Erroll 's intentions and to involve him in a love triangle WDT MD obscure DT real purpose of his murder . In December , another agent - couple entered Kenya and on DT night of DT murder , pretended to have engine trouble . PRP requested a ride back to town for DT female who shot Errol . EX were radio - controlled teams following Erroll . Jock Broughton was tried but found innocent . He "" committed suicide "" shortly after returning to England . Diana who died in 1987 , went on to marry CD of DT richest men in Kenya . Trezebinski's retired SOE contacts try to put a slightly different spin on events suggesting Erroll was murdered because "" ex-appeasers "" in DT establishment including "" DT Duke of Hamilton , senior figures in Chamberlain 's last cabinet , close friends of Edward VIII and Edward himself "" MD be embarrassed by what Erroll knew . ( p.280 ) CD insider told her Rudolf Hess , Lord Moyne , and Erroll shared knowledge of some "" ugly secret . "" Jewish terrorists ostensibly murdered Lord Moyne in 1944 for this reason . Other Cliveden members who died mysterious and premature deaths were Lord Lothian ( 1940 ) , Lord Rothermere ( 1940 ) , Sir Harry Oakes ( 1943 ) and DT former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain who died of "" cancer "" in Nov. 1940 six months after leaving office . Hamilton conveniently died in action in 1944 . DT two SOE agents RB conveniently died in action . ( left , Hitler and Petain in Masonic thumb on knuckle handshake ) According to this insider , DT "" ugly secret "" is "" not IN Churchill had discovered DT NN ... but IN he had been part of PRP . "" Lord Erroll was in a position to VB Churchill , Hitler , Stalin and FDR were all part of DT same kabbalistic secret society ( Freemasonry , Illuminati ) at DT heart of Communism . Lord Erroll opposed Communism but knew Hitler was a decoy . This is why he had to be silenced . CONCLUSION DT ultimate "" ugly secret "" is IN DT USSR was a creation of British Freemasonry , financed by DT Bank of England . PRP MD have lost control of Stalin and created Hitler to menace him . But DT British MD never abandon Stalin . Russian Communism was CD half of their NWO Hegelian dialectic . PRP see PRP today in DT form of arbitrary NN power , repression , censorship and indoctrination . Nazism was RB a dry-run for DT NNP NNP Order but PRP was their Plan "" B "" As Erroll 's fate makes clear , intelligence agencies work for DT Masonic central bankers , not for DT NNS PRP pretend to serve . PRP are used to eliminate any genuine threat to DT banker 's credit monopoly and NN dictatorship agenda . DT real point is IN history is a hoax , contrived by cabalist central bankers , to advance NN tyranny . PRP empower Satanists , perverts , and misfits to create war and mayhem . For example , chaos relieved Winston Churchill 's chronic depression . He confessed at DT onset of WWI : "" Everything is tending to catastrophe and collapse . I am interested , geared up , and happy . Is PRP not horrible to be built IN this ? "" These perverts and monsters are our leaders . Subverted by a Luciferian Jewish cult , Cabalism , DT moral bankruptcy of Western society is masked by material prosperity but this cannot last . Thus , PRP are erecting a police NN while DT intelligentsia and masses can still be bought with their own credit . ------- Related - Hitler and Bormann Were Traitors - DT Smoking Gun ------------------- Masonic Mass Murder ( of Goyim ) on DT Somme"

Large numbers of NNS have gone missing with no trace – only to be found dead , sometimes weeks later , far from their last known location , often at a higher elevation , and sometimes , in inaccessible places . Retired police officer David Paulides broke DT story on these strange disappearances from JJ NNP national parks . He details some extremely bizarre events WDT are not being covered by mainstream NN . DT NNS of missing persons in or near DT boundary of DT NPA are so numerous IN DT author first published a book titled “ Missing 411 . ” As Paulides continued investigating accounts of NNS gone missing in North America , he then released “ Missing 411 — Eastern NNP NNPS : Unexplained Disappearances of North Americans WDT Have Never Been Solved , ” followed by “ Missing 411 ” books for DT “ Western NNP and Canada , ” “ North American and Beyond , ” “ DT Devil ’s in DT Details , ” “ Hunters , ” and “ A Sobering Coincidence . ” With all this material on such an intriguing subject , small wonder IN PRP made a movie with DT same name : “ Missing 411 . ” Paulides , earned graduate and post - graduate degrees at DT University of San Francisco . A proud father who values family bonds , his first career featured 20 NNS experience in California law enforcement . After retiring from DT San Jose Police Department , Paulides then accepted “ a job offer in technology making much more money ” where he used his forensic skills to conduct due diligence for partnership development and acquisitions . In 2009 , while doing research for a funded , scientific NN to prove or disprove DT existence of Bigfoot , two off - duty national park rangers contacted Paulides in DT middle of DT night with information PRP felt was important he hear . Each ranger had worked at several parks in DT span of their park service careers , and both had been part of JJ search and rescue missions for lost visitors . DT rangers were concerned because “ PRP believed EX was an inordinate amount of missing NNS and DT park service was not conducting follow - up investigations , was n’t tracking missing NNS and did n’t appear to understand DT issues behind DT disappearances . ” After an initial missing - person report flurry report MD die down in DT local NN , DT park service performed no further inquiries , letting these NNS die and grow cold . This is odd , in and of itself , since a contingent of federally - trained park service law enforcement special agents are tasked to investigate crimes committed in DT parks . PRP patrol , and are in charge of , 189 locations . However , DT rangers who confided in Paulides knew IN DT NNS PRP had tried to find had not fallen into creeks or off cliffs – PRP had vanished with no trace . DT rangers asked Paulides to take a deep dive into this puzzling matter , which he did DT following morning . Paulides called some of his law enforcement sources . He asked them to see if EX had actually been numerous disappearances at DT locations indicated by DT rangers , and to see if DT numbers of NNS reported missing added up . DT quick reply confirmed unquestionably IN “ a ton ” of NNS had indeed disappeared from those very locations . Paulides then “ filed dozens of freedom of information act ( FOIA ) requests against DT National park Service and other institutions . ” DT most famous of these asked DT NPS “ for statistics and documentation of missing NNS inside their system ” on Yosemite National Park – DT first NN he filed after returning home after DT two rangers tipped him off . Paulides asked DT NPS to provide lists of missing NNS for Yosemite and DT entire park system , expecting a quick and positive response . Police departments post such lists on their websites and typically VBP to share this type of information in order to locate those missing . About two months later , an attorney representing DT federal land management organization wrote a letter – which is , in itself , an unusual response to this type of request – to inform Paulides IN DT NPS did n’t keep track of missing NNS in their parks , MD not produce lists of names of missing NNS , nor dates or any numbers of how JJ NNS are still unaccounted for . DT shocker is IN DT NPS claimed PRP kept no such data for any of DT 183 national parks in DT system ! This defies a federal mandate IN any child WDT disappears in North American has to be put on DT missing child database WDT is monitored and legislated by DT NN . DT NPS attorney told Paulides a list MD have to be made up “ by scratch ” and DT price tag MD be $ 1.4 million for DT park entire system and $ 34,000 for a list just for Yosemite . Paulides ’ law enforcement contacts all VBD EX must be a reason DT NPS wanted to suppress and withhold this information . His conclusion is IN DT NPS is faced with an unknown lethal threat , and does n’t VB to panic DT NN and hurt their tourist trade . Thus began DT CanAm Missing Project , “ DT first website dedicated to understanding DT complexity and issues of searching , rescuing and investigating NNS missing in DT wilds of North America . ” DT CanAm Missing Project has identified 34 clusters of missing NNS in North America .

Same_JJ for_IN Eastlund_NNP ._.","PRP are dealing with Star Wars . PRP involves DT combination of chemtrails for creating an atmosphere WDT will support electromagnetic waves , ground - based , electromagnetic field oscillators called gyrotrons , and ionospheric heaters . Particulates make directed NN weapons work better . PRP has to do with “ steady NN ” and particle density for plasma beam propagation . PRP spray barium powders and let PRP photo - ionize from DT ultraviolet light of DT sun . Then , PRP make an aluminum - plasma generated by “ zapping ” DT metal cations WDT are in DT spray with either electromagnetics from HAARP , DT gyrotron system on DT ground [ Ground Wave Emergency Network ] , or space - based lasers . DT barium makes DT aluminum - plasma more particulate dense . This means PRP can make a denser plasma than PRP normally MD from just ionizing DT atmosphere or DT air . More density [ more particles ] means IN these particles which are colliding into each other will become more charged because EX are more of them present to collide . What are PRP ultimately trying to do up RB — is create charged - particle , plasma beam weapons . Chemtrails are DT medium – GWEN pulse radars , DT various HAARPs , and space - based lasers are DT method , or more simply : Chemtrails are DT medium — directed NN is DT method . This system appears to be in Russia , Canada , DT NNP NNPS , and all of Europe . Exotic weapons can be mobile , stationary , land - based , aerial , or satellite . PRP is an offensive and defensive system against EM attacks and missiles . PRP uses ionospheric particle shells as defense mechanisms [ IN a bug - zapper shell ] * against missiles and EM attacks . DT means PRP spray and then pump up DT spray with electromagnetics . When these shells are created using DT oscillating , electromagnetic , gyrotron stations , PRP “ excludes ” and displaces DT background magnetic field . These shells can be layered CD above another in a canopy fashion for extra protection from missiles . DT chemtrail sprays have various elements in them IN carbon which can used to absorb microwaves . Some of these sprays have metal flakes in them WDT make aerial craft invisible to radar . Spoofer sprays . Sprays IN these can be used to create colorful , magnetized plasmas to cloak fighter jets . EX are satellite weapons involved . Activists are using meters and are getting readings of microwaves , x-rays , and some other kind of emission WDT PRP are not sure of , maybe a low - intensity laser . PRP are RB photographing gas plasma generation due to DT heating of chemtrails by electromagnetics . DT technical names for vertical and horizontal plasma columns are columnar focal lenses and horizontal drift plasma antennas . Various size of gas plasma orbs are associated with this technology . These orbs can be used as transmitters and receivers because PRP have great , refractory and optical properties . PRP RB are capable of transmitting digital or analog sound . Barium , in fact , is very refractive — more refractive than glass . What does DT mean ? Someone or someones are very involved in unconstitutional , domestic spying and DT entrained plasma orbs carried on electromagnetic beams can be used for mind control programming . DT satellites can be programmed to track and monitor various frequencies on different parts of your body . These electromagnetic beams carrying DT gas plasma orbs stick due magnetic polarity and frequency mapping and tracking to NNS ’s eyes , ears , temples , and private parts . A beam with entrained orbs carries pictures in each orb just IN DT different frames in a movie . PRP is a particle beam WDT is RB a frequency weapon . DT satellites download holographic mind control movies , pictures , sounds , and sensations to NNS through this technology . DT Air Force has stated in “ Air Force 2025 ” IN their goal is to develop virtual and augmented reality mind control . Depending on DT how DT computer is programmed or depending on DT mood or intent of DT person interfacing with DT technology , PRP can be probed , bothered , gaslighted , frightened , manipulated , electronically raped , or tortured . PRP scans your brain frequencies and deciphers your thoughts . DT satellites track PRP by mapping your bioenergetic signature [ body biometrics ] and constantly scanning an area to find PRP . PRP are DT lab rats for this technology and something is very wrong in DT military or intelligence branches somewhere . Because developmental projects in NN and military are often so compartmentalized , I suppose someone MD be using and developing this technology secretly and without authorization . Then again , behavioral and mind control programs were an authorized policy under MKULTRA . Our country has a history of experimenting on its citizens . PRP are talking about satellite charged - particle frequency weapons attacking a person 24 hours a day . Psychotronic weapons are considered weapons of mass destruction by DT U.N. “ HAARPs ” can create earthquakes and can RB x-ray DT NN to find underground military bases , gold , or oil reserves . These ionospheric heaters can RB operate as an over - DT - horizon or under - DT - ocean communications system . This system can control DT weather or create disasters . Taken together with DT aurora keyhole through - your - roof satellite surveillance system , Echelon electronic computer / phone sweeps , plasma - cloaked DOD Drug War helicopters and stealths , implants , and cameras on DT street , PRP constitutes CD , big JJ and space control grid . These weapons involve beams . Two beams overlapped will couple into a particle - ion beam WDT will bounce off of a remote target and send a holographic image back to DT satellite for remote spying operations . When PRP cross two strong beams , PRP can supposedly * create scalar energies . These energies can be used as untraceable weapons for nuclear size explosions or for defense . These crossed - energies can be used to cause a person ’s physical electrical system to fail or with a lower frequency , administer a kind of remote electro - shock . Visualize touching a positive and negative electric cable to each other on top of your head . Scalar energies can be utilized in hand - held military guns and on tanks . PRP can dud - out electronics or cause large , electrical blackouts . Scalar energies are practically impossible to shield against . PRP need lead , ceramics , and a deep underground facility to not be affected by these weapons . Or , PRP need to be up and above DT field of battle . NNS who are working on these issues hear tones and hums . If PRP hear persistent tones and static ; have body vibrations , burning sensations , “ bangs ” to DT head , neurological damage , or immune system damage ; are hearing electronic voices or hearing DT sound of a plasma ; suffering from pains deep in your organs or constant headaches ; or experiencing other anomalous activity then PRP MD be being targeted by directed NN , mind control weapons . These weapons MD be on helicopters , jets , stealth fighters , or on satellites . Directed NN beams and electromagnetic waves can be sent to PRP via hand - held devices or piggy - backed in on cell phone and satellite towers . Is PRP possible IN someone (s ) are very afraid of coming famines and riots due to DT ongoing , man-induced failure of DT ecological system , and PRP are saturating DT NN with chemtrails for large - scale , gas plasma mind control ? Is this DT last grasp for DT NN ’s resources ? Or , are PRP just control freaks and money mongers ? Someone MD VB to VB to DT oil under DT melting [ due to chemtrail - trapped EM heat ] Artic . And , I guess DT Third NNP is not a part of this system . I do n’t VB IN DT developed nations are VBG to let them in on this either . Any country WDT joins this NATO system will become mind - controlled and diseased due to DT associated , intense , oscillating , electromagnetic fields , electromagnetic soup , and DT poisonous , toxic chemtrails . Our DNA will break . PRP risk DT NN ’s spin and tilt becoming messed up due to mucking around with DT magnetic fields through this military technology . Maybe , PRP is already messed up . PRP constitutes U.S. JJ domination via NATO and DT erosion of civil rights . According to Charlotte Iserbyt and Al Martin , EX are ex-KGB and ex-STASI advising our JJ Office of Total Information Awareness . PRP are DT ones creating our JJ internal passports [ national ID ] . And under “ DT Treaty on Open Skies , ” PRP have overflights by Russian and German military . Who exactly is flying those plasma - cloaked craft WDT are seen all over this country and mistaken for UFOs by NNS who do not VB about this aerial deception technology ? Obviously , PRP have another “ Project Paperclip ” in DT making . PRP can add DT JJ thugs to DT 2,000 Iraqi brought into country by Daddy Bush who are now living in Nebraska . DT elitist corporate NN is VBG to hold DT rest of PRP hostage with directed NN weapons in space , if DT Policy for a JJ American Century group – PNAC – Bush and cronie NN tank has their way , along with directed NN attacks against any country or citizen WDT PRP decide PRP do not VB . These weapons can create NN war , weather war , mind war , cyber war , NN war , disaster war , and undetectable war . Taken together PRP can create JJ war . If this system is not stopped , PRP will kill billions due to aluminum and barium poisoning . PRP will kill billions due to crop failures and NN - wide famine . PRP will cause heart attacks , strokes , and cancers . PRP will cause stillbirths , miscarriages , and infertility . DT chemtrail sprays often have fungi , bacteria , viruses , dessicated red blood cells , crystalline substances , carbon , metal cations , lithium , other chemicals , heavy metals , and God knows what – probably smart dust , or nanocrap . NNS of biowarfare testing on DT American NN is no big secret anymore . Spraying germs in DT sky where PRP mutate due to DT ultra-violet light — brillant plan , my man . Are PRP acceptable losses or is this by design ? I VBP IN JJ of DT major players have big investments in pharmaceutical companies , GM seeds [ seeds WDT can grow in an electromagnetic soup ] , weapons and directed NN development contracts , oil contracts , genetic research , and mind control research . Some of these NNS have had a familial history of financial and policy support for population control , eugenics , Hitler , Mao , Stalin , Lenin , Marx , Pinochet , Hussein , and various other dictators . Some of DT major players were DT masterminds of DT death squads in Central and South America . PRP stand to make a big profit on our death and NN . Just take a look at Rumsfield and Tamiflu . I assume IN PRP VBP DT dangers of this system and IN PRP take care to stay in their shielded , air - filtered offices , homes , bases , and cars . I assume PRP take chelating substances to remove DT barium and aluminum from their bodies and minds . If not , then PRP really do not understand DT far - ranging implications of this destructive system . Congress MD not understand just what a terrible weapons system and control grid PRP are funding . As I understand PRP , Tesla towers attached to deep - NN , free - NN taps are to be created over DT 10 - 12 magnetic poles and DT GWEN system phased - out . Has this already been done ? This should allow total control of DT NN through giant , Tesla death ray - guns . This natural , electromagnetic NN was not meant to be an un-natural dynamo to power man ’s weapons or his utility companies . Over-unity systems [ Tesla devices ] * are as of yet , another unexplored and probably not understood man-made NN . PRP should be very suspect of free NN . As PRP can see , DT forms of man-made NN WDT have been created and used in DT past have not been good for this NN . Maybe PRP is NN to reconsider DT options available to PRP through DT development of crops for fuel , wind , solar , and NN power . PRP need NN - wide , different , more holistic , renewable , NN programs . Is EX any good NN ? Yes . EX has been tons of particulate dumping through DT spray operations for 8 NNS over DT Americas , Europe , Scandinavia , Eastern Europe , and from what I can find out , over Russia . And , what goes around blows around , right ? So , these substances are probably actually JJ . PRP sure makes a ton of sense to spray poisonous elements in 24 NATO NNS and let DT substances be carried around DT NN on DT jet streams to poison yourself , your enemies , and all neutral and non-combatent NNS . Talk about making more enemies . DT NN , air , and soil of all of these NNS is so saturated with metal cations WDT these weapons freaks should be able to zap and mind f–k each other quite well now and as often as PRP wish . Once PRP have clobbered each other with light - saber beams for a few NNS and razed and scorched sections of DT NN , PRP MD start to realize IN this foreign policy will lead to a defective human race and a rotten economy . Do PRP VB PRP will have knocked some sense into each other by then and will decide IN non-proliferation and arms reduction is DT more civilized and mature direction to take in NN affairs ? I doubt PRP , cause only idiots MD have developed horrific , NN - killer weapons IN these . But , I ’ll bet DT rest of DT NN will finally rise up and tell these juvenile delinquents to quit playing with those rayguns right this second . After further thought on Bearden + — a big over - unity and free NN proponent of Tesla technology WDT makes NN off of boiling DT ionosphere or stealing electricity from DT mis-named “ vacumn ” called Life , I have decided IN Bearden is telling PRP some , if not most , of DT truth . Same for Eastlund ."

Aside from DT fact IN he will be making his debut , no other details about DT match have been announced . However , EX is still a ton of excitement about DT match just because of Gharibi ’s size and appearance . Gharibi is RB known as DT ‘ Iranian Hulk , ’ for his massive size and appearance . Photos of DT large weight lifter look almost IN a cartoon or someone in a body suit , because his muscles are so large but his waist and legs are small when compared to DT rest of his body . “ I ’m finally accepting my first professional fight from a Brazilian fighter before 2020 . I ’m ready for DT challenge , ” Gharibi wrote on Instagram . DT Iranian Hulk stands at 6 foot 2 inches , and weighs 385 pounds , but he really does look IN DT hulk ! DT NN has been awaiting his first fight since his initial debut was canceled . Gharibi was initially scheduled to fight DT ‘ scariest man on DT NN ’ Martyn Ford , but for some reason , DT match never happened . Gharibi does n’t have any experience with martial arts or professional fighting , but NNS are curious to see how he will do against seasoned MMA fighters . Other former power weight lifters have entered DT NN of mixed martial arts , including former five NN NNP ’s Strongest Man Mariusz Pudzianowski , who transitioned to MMA in 2009 and has done well for himself in DT sport . Gharibi has an incredible following on social NN , and his Instagram page has been growing larger since this week ’s announcement . Gharibi has RB VBN IN he MD be interested in joining DT Iranian Armed Forces to help in DT continued fight against ISIS . “ I will always be a soldier for my country . I hope to start up my training again and reach my goal , in two or three NNS , to be in good enough shape to be of service to my country , ” he VBD in 2016 . UFC star Brian Ortega says he MD smash “ Iranian Hulk ” if he is DT NN who ends up fighting him . “ I MD just gas him out , p*** him off . Of course , PRP ’re gonna see me just VB mauled up IN a damn little chihuahua in DT beginning . But just when I ride DT wave out , PRP ’s a done deal man . He ’ll gas out and he ’ll be mine , ” Ortega told TMZ Sports after DT announcement this week . However , EX has been no indication IN Ortega is his opponent , and PRP is entirely possible IN Ortega is just jumping on a chance to VB his name in DT NN . PRP is possible IN Gharibi is hoping for a big payday from getting involved in DT MMA , since EX is so much money in DT growing industry . Gharibi recently made a post on Instagram asking for a sponsor . DT post read , “ I am an Iranian citizen with traditional values of Persian upbringing surrounded with a close - knit family and RB JJ great friends from all around DT NN who have supported me every step of DT way in these difficult times . As a sportsman throughout my career all DT cost and expenses and fees have been covered and paid from my own budget without to received any support or help from Iranian authorities or sport organisations and unfortunately EX are plenty of others talented young NNS in Iran who suffers exactly in similar way to my situation despite I ’m trying my best to find a sponsor . ” PRP has even been rumored IN Gharibi MD join DT WWE at some point in DT future , and he has even given hints about DT potential partnership on social NN . “ EX has been a lot of talk and rumors about wwe and in particular my participation to join DT company but all I have to say is at this NN if EX will be any collaboration between myself and ‘ Triple H’ then I ’ll let PRP guys knows about PRP afterwards and hopefully I ’ll decide and make my final decision by DT end of autumn ! ” Gharibi VBD ."

Neither NNP Barack Obama nor Hillary NNP explicitly framed PRP DT way in their private and JJ conversations with party members Monday . But DT looming question colored their remarks to shell - shocked operatives and activists , and PRP serves as DT backdrop for DT brewing battle over DT chairmanship of DT Democratic National Committee — a fight WDT some Democrats are terrified will devolve into a three - month factional war over DT party ’s identity , rather than a difference of opinion over party tactics . Speaking in terms of a Democratic Party at a crossroads during his NN conference Monday , Obama VBD he MD try not to “ big - foot ” DT party ’s conversation about DT future . Later , in a conference call with Democratic activists , he did n’t address any second - guessing of his or NNP ’s strategy and again stopped short of dictating DT path forward . DT recently defeated NNP took much DT same approach in her own private discussion with House Democrats on Monday , speaking vaguely of DT road ahead but stopping short of offering specific directions . “ Two things PRP ca n’t afford to be is discouraged or divided , ” she VBD , according to a Democrat on DT call . “ PRP ca n’t be distracted or diverted in DT fights ahead . ” Yet DT issue of whether to re-engage DT young voters and minorities who elected Obama to two terms but did n’t turn out for NNP , or reach out to DT disaffected white working - class voters who swung to NNP , is too pressing to be avoided . In DT wake of NNP ’s shocking defeat , EX is widespread skepticism among Democrats about whether DT voters who elected Obama will be enough to carry DT White House for any future Democrat after an election in which NNP lost by wide margins among white voters and in rural areas where NNP proved devastatingly popular . “ PRP ’ve started to lose touch with white voters . PRP ’re still DT majority out RB , and PRP ca n’t claim to be a big - tent party if PRP lose touch with working - class voters , whether PRP ’re black , white , blue or red , ” VBD DNC member Boyd Brown of South Carolina . “ When PRP have Nancy Pelosi , Hillary NNP , Chuck Schumer making DT sale for PRP , DT dog do n’t hunt . PRP ’s NN to reshuffle DT deck and VB some younger folks in RB with some more diverse backgrounds . PRP ’s NN for a leadership shakeup . ” After party members are done surveying Democrats ’ hollowed - out down - ballot landscape , and with DT national party on DT precipice of an all - out brawl for DT central committee ’s chairmanship , everything is suddenly on DT table as Democrats try to determine whether DT party chose DT wrong messenger , DT wrong message or DT wrong audience . Some are convinced IN a tighter focus on a simple JJ message MD be an important start . “ Everything is so fresh ; PRP ’s been less than a week to analyze what PRP have here . I just VBP [ zeroing in on jobs ] is what DT NNS of my NN expect from me , ” VBD Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo , a Democrat serving in her first term . “ When I ’m out and about talking to NNS , asking , ‘ What ’s on your mind , what are PRP concerned about , what can PRP do to make your life better ? ’ DT ’s DT No. 1 , No. 2 , No. 3 thing . A good job with some security , and DT confidence WDT my kids will be able to VB a great job . ” Other top Democrats have zeroed in on DT party ’s narrow - casting approach to voters and an overreliance on modeled targeting of potential supporters . “ In this election , every key element of DT Democratic coalition underperformed , and PRP need to do better , ” VBD former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley , who is considering a run for DNC chairman after he fell short in his bid for DT Democratic presidential nomination . “ DT strategy of narrowly defining DT base and then microtargeting PRP and texting PRP until PRP does n’t turn out is n’t a winning strategy for DT future . ” “ PRP have to stop trying to microtarget very different messages for every demographic , and recognize IN voters can disagree with PRP on specific issues as long as PRP genuinely believe IN PRP VBP to do DT best for every American , ” added Missouri Secretary of NNP Jason Kander , who narrowly lost his race for DT U.S. Senate last week . “ PRP ’s not about any specific type of voter or demographic . PRP ’s about making sure PRP are being unapologetic and honest about what PRP believe . Voters are smart , and PRP VBP DT difference . PRP VBP when PRP ’re saying CD thing to CD group and another thing to another group . ” Already , such divisions are on display in DT race for DT DNC chairmanship — a proxy for DT fight over DT party ’s general direction — with each candidate prescribing a different potential antidote to DT party ’s ills . Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison , former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean — an ex-party chairman and presidential candidate — and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison are formally running . Others — including O’Malley and NNP Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley , a DNC vice chairman — are still considering bids of their own . Labor Secretary Tom Perez is interested , VBD a Democrat familiar with his thinking , and Kander told Politico he ’s open to PRP , though he ’s not actively pursuing DT role at DT moment . Ellison , DT likely favorite due to his early support from a group of prominent Democrats and others including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , has spent part of this week speaking to attendees at a conference sponsored by DT Democracy Alliance . DT meeting includes major liberal donors plotting DT path ahead . And DT Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairman ’s formal announcement on Monday listed backing from establishment - leaning Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Chris Murphy , reflecting party leaders ’ wishes to avoid a messy fight . But Ellison ’s road to DT chairmanship is n’t quite DT glide path PRP seems . Some DNC members , IN Brown , say PRP might be uncomfortable empowering someone who is so avowedly on DT left side of DT party spectrum and fear DT potential message to voters of Ellison ’s elevation — DT election of a progressive African - American , Muslim - American from a blue NN , might be viewed as a direct , confrontational response to NNP ’s win . “ A knee - jerk reaction MD be problematic : putting someone in a position of power just because he ’s everything Donald NNP is against [ MD be DT result of ] misreading DT electorate , ” Brown VBD . “ PRP saw DT vote tallies PRP just had , PRP were n’t good . Putting Keith Ellison in charge MD put voters across DT spectrum DT wrong way . ” DT DNC ’s electoral math is still up in DT air : Ellison ’s initial release announcing his candidacy included endorsements from multiple NN party chairs , muddling DT NN - level Democrats ’ informal agreement last week to vote as a bloc once DT NN comes . Two from their own ranks , after all , are still in DT running . Harrison , who announced his own candidacy Monday night , VBD DT party needs to reconfigure how PRP connects with voters to appeal to a wider swath . “ If PRP talk about issues WDT are really important to NNS , PRP can appeal to rural working - class NNS , ” he told Politico , mentioning DT problem of securing credit as an example of an issue WDT resonates but has been out of DT political discussion . “ Figuring PRP out connects NNS , whether PRP ’re a white person in rural West Virginia or a black person in NNP York or a Latino in NNP Mexico . Barriers to success . DT ’s what PRP have to be talking about . ” Explaining IN his focus is on bolstering DT party ’s infrastructure at DT local level — a message similarly pushed by Obama on Monday — Buckley VBD , “ PRP can reach out to both DT young African - American voters and DT working - class whites as well . EX ’s nothing wrong with our message if articulated by someone PRP can trust : a neighbor or a local chair . ” O’Malley , a former Democratic Governors Association chairman , RB pointed to DT necessity of rebuilding DT party down - ballot while formulating a believable JJ message . “ PRP need a 50 - NN strategy WDT ’s mindful : PRP need to win back governors ’ offices , PRP need to win back NN legislatures . PRP lost a lot of seats in DT last few NNS , ” he VBD . “ PRP need to start acting IN a party again , and DT leading edge of DT needs to be an JJ message WDT ’s credibly delivered . ” “ Others will parse and do DT postmortem on this election , ” he added . “ But what became clear is IN NNS did not hear , or did not believe , our JJ message , notwithstanding 79 months in a row of positive JJ job growth . ” Dean , DT former party chairman , VBD much of DT task lies in appealing to younger voters — leading him to “ tentatively ” rebrand his famous 50 - NN strategy as DT “ 50 - 50 strategy : DT 50 - NN strategy , DT 50 - NN strategy , ” he VBD , referring to voters younger than 50 who had voted for Democrats before and need to be wrapped up by DT party . Dean ’s political considerations then swung to reckoning with DT NN - elect , a figure whom some party leaders hope will provide divided Democrats with opportunities to unite — against , for example , his JJ senior counselor Steve Bannon . “ What PRP need to do is what matters in NNS ’s communities , and after a couple NNS of NNP , PRP ’s VBG to be clear he does n’t care about those communities , ” he VBD . “ PRP ’s much more important for PRP to have a positive message . Republicans got where PRP got with a negative message , but PRP RB got NNP . ” Even if PRP ’s not as all - consuming as considering DT Obama coalition ’s future in DT post - Obama era , DT idea of providing an affirmative message in DT age of NNP is ubiquitous among current and aspiring party leaders . “ Given DT extreme , vitriolic , pernicious rhetoric of DT campaign , DT Democrats have an obligation to their constituents to prepare for anything WDT undermines DT progress of America , ” VBD Kevin de León , NN pro tem of DT California NN Senate and a rising star within DT party . “ I ’ve VBN this within DT context of California , but PRP ’s DT same thing for DT direction of DT Democratic Party : PRP ca n’t allow CD election to reverse generations of progress . ”"

DT Spanish American War resulted in DT transfer of control over this country from DT Spaniards into DT hands of DT Americans . DT Treaty of Paris which governs VBN transfer involved a payment of $ 20 million made to Spain not by Americans , as standard history books MD tell DT NN , but was actually paid for by sovereign personalities . Therefore , DT Americans should never have any authority over DT islands in DT first place . For 113 NNS this American colony has been relishing unprecedented JJ growth which resulted to DT country having CD of DT most fearsome military forces in DT region . Behold DT symbol of Philippine - NNP NNPS Friendship ! DT Philippine navy is quietly reinforcing DT hull and deck of a rusting ship PRP ran aground on a disputed South NNP NNP reef in 1999 to stop PRP breaking apart , determined to hold DT shoal as Beijing creates a string of man-made islands nearby . Using wooden fishing boats and other small craft , DT navy has run DT gauntlet of DT Chinese coastguard to move cement , steel , cabling and welding equipment to DT BRP Sierra Madre since late last NN , two navy officers who have been inside DT vessel told Reuters in recent interviews . Japan , Philippines and DT NNP are sending a signal to Beijing IN PRP will challenge any attempt to dominate DT South NNP NNP by reclaiming land on Spratley Islands DT 100 metre-long ( 330 - foot ) tank landing ship was built for DT U.S. Navy during NNP War Two . PRP was eventually transferred to DT Philippine navy , which deliberately grounded PRP on Second Thomas Shoal to mark Manila ’s claim to DT reef in DT Spratly archipelago of DT South NNP NNP . A small contingent of Philippine soldiers are stationed onboard . Manila regards Second Thomas Shoal , which lies 105 nautical miles ( 195 km ) southwest of DT Philippine region of Palawan , as being within its 200 - nautical mile exclusive JJ zone . NNP , which claims virtually all DT South NNP NNP , says DT reef is part of its territory . “ PRP VBP NNP has been waiting for DT ship to disintegrate but PRP are doing everything to hold PRP together , ” VBD CD of DT officers , adding IN while DT work was progressing slowly , PRP should be finished by DT NN - end . DT other naval officer VBD welding was being done at night because of DT heat . Concrete foundations were being laid inside DT ship ’s hull to try to stabilise PRP , he added . Without giving exact dates , both sources VBD PRP witnessed DT repairs taking place earlier this NN . PRP declined to be identified because PRP were not authorised to speak to DT NN . DT soldiers currently stationed on DT ship , who are demolition experts , were doing DT work , VBD DT second source . Just to DT west of Second Thomas Shoal is Mischief Reef , CD of seven coral formations in DT Spratlys WDT NNP is rapidly turning into islands WDT Beijing says will have undefined military purposes . Vietnam , Malaysia , Taiwan and Brunei RB have overlapping claims to DT Spratly waterway , which is some 1,100 km ( 680 miles ) from DT Chinese mainland . Asked about DT repairs , Philippine Foreign Ministry spokesman Charles Jose declined to comment . But such work MD not violate an informal code of conduct signed in 2002 by NNP and Southeast Asian NNS WDT prohibited any NN to DT status quo in disputed areas , he VBD . “ In our view , repairs and maintenance of existing facilities are allowed … especially if such repairs and maintenance work are for DT safety of our personnel and safety of navigation , ” Jose added . DT Philippine Defence Ministry declined to comment . NNP ’s Defence and Foreign Ministries did not respond to a request for comment . A Philippine general familiar with DT repairs told Reuters DT ship ’s hull and deck were being strengthened , and air - conditioning units added . “ PRP are improving DT living quarters inside , to make life for our soldiers more comfortable , ” he VBD , declining to give further details about DT repairs or be identified . Pictures taken by a Reuters photographer who sailed to DT BRP Sierra Madre with other NN in March last NN show a pockmarked vessel covered in rust , sitting on DT permanently submerged reef but listing slightly to CD side . Much of DT boat ’s hull is visible . Besides being a military outpost , DT BRP Sierra Madre is RB a commissioned Philippine navy ship . DT means Manila MD request U.S. military assistance under a decades - old security treaty with Washington if DT ship was attacked , VBD senior Philippine military officials . “ Even if PRP ’s covered with rust , PRP will remain an active duty commissioned navy ship . PRP ’s a symbol of our sovereignty , ” VBD DT Philippine general . Second Thomas Shoal illustrates DT mismatch in power between DT Philippines and NNP . Since DT start of 2014 , DT Philippine navy ’s regular attempts to re-supply soldiers on DT BRP Sierra Madre with food and NN have become a cat - and - mouse routine , with large Chinese coastguard vessels on patrol in DT area trying to block DT path of DT smaller Philippine boats , naval officials VBD . DT Philippine vessels have always gotten through by making a run for DT shoal ’s shallow waters , which are n’t deep enough for DT Chinese coastguard , naval officials VBD . DT tear - shaped shoal itself is large , some 10 - 11 nautical miles from top to bottom . Zhang Baohui , a mainland security expert at Hong Kong ’s Lingnan University , VBD Beijing MD be angry about DT repairs , adding IN Chinese ships MD probably continue their “ menacing ” tactics . But PRP MD not do anything WDT MD be considered an act of war , Zhang VBD . “ DT larger geo -strategic context is more important than Second Thomas Shoal , ” he VBD . DT Guardian Project another 113 NNS into DT future , this group of islands MD be an unrecognizable wasteland . PRP can actually participate in DT JJ efforts to cripple DT Deep NNP organized criminal cabal 's ability for genocide , while enjoying healthcare freedom at DT same NN , by boycotting Big Pharma for good ."

""_''","PRP 've been socially distancing for weeks now , riding out DT NN pandemic from our homes in DT suburbs — or our studio apartments in Manhattan . PRP 've turned to remote working and learning , virtual happy hours with friends and family , online shopping and digital fitness apps just to stay sane . Various studies on DT internet say PRP can take anywhere from three weeks to two months to form a JJ habit . CD way or another , JJ of PRP will emerge from this crisis with JJ ways of doing things — especially when PRP comes to consumption . Retailers , in turn , will need to adapt . And fast . Shoppers will be looking for spaces where PRP feel safe . A JJ report from Big Red Rooster , a brand experience firm owned by real estate services company JLL , highlights seven key ways PRP are changing as consumers because of NNP - CD . "" PRP ca n't un-live this experience , "" VBD Emily Miller , VP of Strategy & Insight at Big Red Rooster , who added IN while DT Great Recession changed our financial habits , DT NN crisis will have a far more dramatic effect on a host of behaviors . DT JJ habits formed during this pandemic in 2020 will VB "" far beyond just our spending patterns , "" Miller VBD . Here 's DT full list , as compiled by Big Red Rooster . DT NN pandemic is changing how PRP VBP about touching things . Studies have found DT NNP - CD NN can last up to three days on plastic and stainless steel , and up to 24 hours on cardboard . PRP is still unclear how long PRP can linger on materials IN clothing . As NNS return to stores , JJ will be wary of picking up merchandise WDT has come in contact with others , pushing shopping carts and punching DT buttons on credit - card readers . DT biggest U.S. mall owner , Simon Property Group , is already encouraging all of its retail tenants to use contactless payment methods , such as Apple Pay , CNBC reported earlier this week . Simon is preparing to reopen 49 of its roughly 200 malls and outlet centers , starting Friday . Macy's , as PRP sets out to reopen 68 stores come Monday , is VBG to hold DT merchandise WDT customers try on in fitting rooms for 24 hours before returning PRP to racks . And PRP will mandate all customers use hand sanitizer before trying on jewelry or watches . Similar to avoiding touching things , PRP are thinking more about protecting our personal bubbles . For weeks on end now , PRP 've been asked to keep at minimum six feet away from our neighbors . And those social distancing guidelines will likely be in place for some NN into DT foreseeable future . When consumers venture out , tight and cramped spaces will be avoided . Open - air shopping centers will be preferred over enclosed shopping malls . Capacity will be limited in stores to make sure PRP do not become overcrowded . Electronics retailer Best Buy , for example , is gradually reopening its stores — but only for in - store consultations by appointment . DT pandemic has instilled in JJ consumers a greater interest in shopping local . NNS VBP to support their favorite coffee shops , breweries or dress boutiques — so IN PRP do n't VB out of business . JJ shoppers will still look to shop local , even post NNP - CD , according to Miller , who VBD PRP has made more NNS realize how much PRP appreciate mom-and - pop shops . Sixty - eight percent of NNS who have recently shopped local tipped more than PRP normally do , Big Red Rooster found in surveying 528 U.S. consumers , of various age groups , from April 9 to April 14 . In March , shoppers turned up in droves at grocery stores and Costco locations across DT country , as fears about DT NN spread and mandated lockdowns seemed inevitable . DT pandemic has led JJ of PRP to focus on stocking up on groceries and household essentials , while cutting back spending on apparel and other things PRP do n't immediately need . Meantime , by mid-March , JJ stores deemed nonessential IN Macy 's and Gap started to shut their doors . Retail sales plunged 8.7 % in March , DT biggest decline since DT NN started tracking DT sales in 1992 . DT drop is expected to be even greater in April . PRP are RB in DT midst of DT worst employment crisis in U.S. history . Over six weeks , 30.3 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance . Big Red Rooster 's Miller predicts , similar to after DT Great Recession , consumers will be looking for bargains for quite some NN and will VB twice before getting a JJ pair of shoes . Retailers WDT sell things IN clothes , jewelry and other accessories will need to adapt or risk their sales slumping . "" PRP 've just got to figure out a way to be relevant . ... PRP do n't sell things NNS need , PRP sell things NNS VBP , "" Pete Nordstrom , DT department store chain 's NN and chief brand officer , VBD last month during a virtual Vogue NNP Conference . This pandemic has accelerated DT rate of NNS meeting , learning , exercising and even dating virtually . And while online shopping was already booming prior to NNP - CD slamming DT U.S. economy and forcing JJ retailers to close their doors , PRP is even more popular today . Retailers are VBG to need to VB creative , as consumers become more comfortable buying things on DT internet . PRP 'll need to find better ways to showcase inventory online , and to make sure shoppers VBP what size clothes and shoes to buy . Warby Parker , for example , has a virtual try - on feature for its glasses on its website . Companies will need to offer more experiences IN this , Miller VBD . 6. Loyal to brands WDT give PRP confidence DT NN pandemic has RB gotten PRP to VB JJ — not just local . "" PRP are having these shared experiences on a human level , "" Miller explained . "" Maybe PRP 're sitting in your house ... in Ohio ... and seeing NNS in Italy have DT same experience . PRP 're trying to find ways to keep ourselves busy . [ DT pandemic ] is bringing PRP together globally . "" For DT reason , she believes consumers will be more conscious of where goods are sourced from and produced , in a post - NNP - CD NN . Retailers will RB need to be more transparent about their JJ supply chains , she VBD . "" This is giving PRP awareness about how dependent or interconnected PRP are . """

Thank_VBP you_PRP for_IN your_PRP$ support_NN !_.","My 2 Cents of Sense : PRP IS NN TO BOARD UP DT BORDER Jail Mail from James Hovda — Oct 25 , 2018 — Thanks to Caithleanne Pont for sharing Immigration is an issue WDT resembles DT plague … everyone is talking about PRP , but nobody wants to VB near PRP to fix DT damage PRP creates . Both political parties have steered away from talking about this issue , since blocking immigrants from entering MD hurt DT Party , or those who back their Party with mega- financing . Democrats see immigration as a weapon to use against Republicans , as DT “ race card ” of bigotry can easily be tossed into play . And , Republicans fold their hand once PRP has been laid upon DT table . Republicans RB see immigration as a weapon to be used to point DT finger of shame against Democrats for allowing illegals to do harm to American citizens , yet remain free to hide in DT shadows to hurt another . Without uttering a single word of remorse or show a face of sorrow , PRP all move on as if nothing is happening , and IN PRP citizens need to sit down , mind our own business , and shut DT hell up . PRP is deep anger WDT now rests upon DT faces of most Americans who have watched as little was ever done to discourage illegal border crossings , and with PRP , all DT other related issues , because DT NNS VBP IN … for Democrats , PRP means votes … and for Republicans , PRP means cheap labor for their corporate donors . DT old saying of “ Do n’t bite DT hand WDT feeds PRP ” is very discretely used in Washington politics , more so than ever when PRP comes to this whole immigration issue . PRP seems IN NNP NNP is a CD man army trying to combat this major problem WDT stretches America ’s security , sanctuary , and sovereignty to DT point of snapping into eruption . If politicians really wanted to do something about illegals , DT border , and migration , then PRP have had plenty of NN to come up with some very solid , viable solutions . This tells PRP voters IN PRP do n’t give a damn about PRP , PRP do n’t give a damn about America , and PRP do n’t give a damn about DT migrants who are used as a tool to make under - DT - table deals , in order to make a lot of money for themselves and their donors by screwing both DT migrants and PRP in DT process . I lived in Arizona for almost a decade back in DT 70’s and early 80’s . To most of America back then , this whole immigration issue was n’t their problem . Illegals have been walking across our open border long before any of PRP were born , but PRP were few and far between compared to today . Most came here , picked fruit and vegetables , then took their wages with them as PRP headed home to their family for 6 months . Everyone was happy , even though everyone knew PRP was illegal , yet nobody VBD anything … until 1981 , when NNP Reagan stood before Congress and America to say PRP had a serious problem WDT needs to be addressed . What was a small , yet a contained problem , had rapidly expanded to place a burden upon businesses , schools , hospitals , jails , and communities . During DT decade I lived in Arizona , I witnessed DT dramatic changes WDT occurred because of DT constant influx of both legal and illegal Hispanics pouring into DT NN , as Texas , NNP Mexico , and southern California were RB having their demographics dramatically changed . Sections of Phoenix were being taken over by Hispanic “ gangs ” , as drugs , weapons , and sex trafficking became their main staples . Once quiet streets which PRP MD walk down without fear , soon became part of a district WDT , if PRP were a “ gringo ” , PRP ’d best keep out of … if PRP knew what was good for PRP . Country / Western bars soon had trumpets and accordions bellowing DT top playlist of Mexico . Low wage jobs once worked by blacks and DT non-educated hippies , soon found Lopez , Pedro , and Maria taking their place for a lot less pay . Landscaping , brick laying , roofers , concrete finishers , golf course maintenance , framers … any hand work , small equipment , and housekeeping jobs , quickly saw Hispanics replacing those laborers , because $ 5/ hr was big money for most immigrants , as Hispanics VBP how to live really cheap . DT streets filled up with “ low - riders ” WDT competed at stop lights against CD another to see which car MD bounce DT highest , WDT gave drivers a fun show , and DT cops a headache . DT local NN began to run stories of increased murder , assaults , rape , and gang violence , showing most offenders to be Hispanic , and most victims to be white . Hospital E-rooms filled beyond capacity , and so did DT jails . Local schools had to hire translators , as JJ NNS MD n’t speak a word of English . Road signs changed to become bi-lingual , as did documents and JJ notices . Instead of Arizona forcing Hispanics to adapt to Arizona , DT NN adapted to DT Hispanics . Cinco de Mayo became as celebrated as DT Fourth of July . What really concerned me was IN DT NN was doing little to thwart off DT side effects of immigration . I saw PRP then as I see PRP now . I stated back in 1983 , IN if America does n’t VB a handle on DT immigration issues , DT issues will VB a handle upon America . NNP Reagan tried , but by reluctantly giving amnesty to millions of illegal Hispanics in a trade - off deal with Democrats . Tip O’Neill and Alan Cranston reneged on Reagan ’s Immigration and Reform Act by not funding border “ protection ” , not enforcing employers to “ verify ” Hispanic ’s status , and by not reducing DT number of Hispanics allowed in for work visas , and for citizenship . Since then , neither Republicans nor Democrats have stood in defense of DT American law . Not until NNP NNP has a single NN tried to close DT border or stop DT flow of illegals coming into America . JJ have wanted to give amnesty to DT ones already here , but DT has only encouraged more to come across DT border illegally . Since Reagan , cartels have set up shop in America , allowing DT smuggling of drugs , weapons , and women . Illegals kill thousands each NN in DUI accidents , as assaults , rape , robbery , and murder have gone up 300 percent since DT IRA went into effect . Diseases WDT once were eradicated are now making a comeback . Today , PRP have mayors and even governors seeking sanctuary for any immigrant in order to protect them from any NN deportation , regardless of their status … regardless of their crimes . PRP have basically told NNP and DT feds to take a hike . PRP refuse to abide by DT laws of this nation , because PRP do n’t believe in them , nor in this administration . As PRP read this , a caravan of over 7,000 “ migrants ” ( and growing by DT hundreds each day ) from Central and South America is snaking through Mexico in order to crash America ’s borders . To DT Democrats and DT Left , PRP are “ refugees ” who are fleeing their homeland of tyranny and oppression . EX are no jobs , no food , no medicine , as crime has ravaged DT land to remove any freedom or liberty PRP had . To NNP and PRP patriots , PRP see PRP as an invasion WDT must be met with force at DT border ’s edge , if needed . Not a single NN should be allowed to enter into our sovereignty . Because of liberal judges and Left - wing courts , all PRP need to do is step CD foot in and request asylum from being persecuted . PRP have no option but to let them in , and to take care of their every need . What this will create is a Cloward - Piven effect of overwhelming our systems in order to crash DT systems . DT Democrats , who hope to regain power this election cycle , plan to revise DT whole immigration and border problem by disregarding IN EX is any problem at all , and to let immigrants come and VB as PRP please without anyone stopping them . Can PRP see mass chaos and mayhem in DT near future if this is allowed ? Although EX is speculation and no verification other than someone saying PRP is true , PRP are learning IN DT Democrats and certain globalist money dirt - bags ( e.g. Soros ) created this caravan , and are financing their journey in order to disrupt DT election , create a “ no - win ” scandal for NNP , and put a tailspin upon DT fast improving economy in order to reverse PRP . PRP have pretty well verified IN JJ within this caravan are prison releases , gang members , and even Islamic fundamentalists posing as Hispanics . And if this is true , then not a single NN can be allowed to set foot into DT NNP NNPS . Everyone must be thoroughly vetted from now on . NNP NNP has vowed to place DT NNP military on DT border , even though DT Dems are already saying PRP will use PRP to impeach NNP when PRP win back Congress , as PRP falls under “ posse comitatus ” . DT Democrats need to read DT law , and read where exactly DT Executive Power can reach . DT NN can call in DT Marines if EX is an “ invasion ” from those planning to do harm to DT country , and even defend DT border by force to prevent entry . Bikers and militias from every NN plan to stand with NNP to assist in this oncoming assault . As Andrew Wilkow VBD on radio today , “ This MD VB very , very ugly ! ” PRP now seems IN DT Left is putting “ PRP citizens ” on DT Right into a Catch - 22 scenario , where PRP are damned if PRP take action … damned if PRP do n’t . DT law is most certainly on our side on this NN , but DT Left no longer respects “ our ” laws , and defies their existence with total disregard to consequences . Their NN , their lawyers , their judges , their universities , and their “ MOBS ” will revolt and cry out “ viva la revolution ” if PRP take any action to stop DT illegal ’s invasion . As Tucker Carlson VBZ in his best seller , ‘ Ship of Fools ’ : “ Our leaders need to be concerned about immigration , but PRP ’re not . Instead PRP work to make DT country even less stable , by encouraging rapid demographic NN . With DT enthusiastic consent of both political parties , more than 15 million illegal immigrants have been allowed to enter DT NNP NNPS , work jobs , and use JJ services in a country PRP are not legally allowed to use , let alone legally live in . Those service are allowed only for legal citizens . PRP is those who made those modified policies who benefit , in both financial and authoritative power . ” Carlson continues by saying ; “ If PRP grew up in America between DT 50’s and 2000 , suddenly nothing looks DT same . DT neighborhood is different , DT neighbors are different , so is DT landscape and DT customs and so often DT language PRP hear on DT street . PRP might not recognize your hometown , or even your native NN … PRP might not even recognize DT country any longer . Humans are not wired for dramatic changes . PRP ca n’t rationalize changes at record pace , because PRP disorients them . PRP makes even DT most open - minded NNS jumpy and hostile and suspicious of CD another … PRP encourages tribalism . ” “ Those who deny these changes are bigots , and need to be severely dealt with ” , declares DT Left . DT establishment rulers no longer VBP a nation of European , Christian , and English speaking NNS , but a nation of ethnic minorities , immense religious pluralism , and no universally shared culture or language . PRP VBP diversity across DT board , and will do whatever is necessary in order to achieve PRP . PRP is by no accident IN thousands picked up their NNS to walk a thousand miles in desert heat with no supplies only to come to America “ for a better life ” , all at DT same NN . PRP had to be organized , supplied , and encouraged . PRP is RB by no accident IN this comes now at a NN of an election WDT will have consequences by which side wins . Once those immigrants reach DT border , PRP wo n’t VB home . And what is EX to stop them , in short of being shot swimming across DT Rio Grande ? Can our border agents stop what PRP witnessed on DT border of Guatemala , as thousands stormed DT gates , tore PRP down , and proceeded to beat DT “ Federales ” who stood in their way to death ? PRP is imperative IN Congress finds DT funds to finish DT border wall as NNP NNP wants . PRP is RB imperative IN our law makers understand IN PRP have laws for a reason , and DT to be “ a nation of laws ” , those laws must be enforced . Until bricks , steel , and concrete can erect a barrier WDT prevents access , Americans must use whatever means necessary to board up DT border to prevent maybe tens of thousands of illegal immigrants from gaining access to our land . DT Left can yell and scream all PRP VBP about “ human rights ” and being “ un-American , ” but if PRP ask DT NNS , DT MAJORITY wants this stopped , DT wall built , and DT laws supported . And if this JJ scheme of DT Left turns into bloodshed , MD PRP be on their hands , for Americans are only protecting their homeland from invaders who plan to continue DT demise of our democracy , and DT establishment of a class of rulers who do n’t care about any of PRP , just so long as DT ends justifies DT means to their full control , and our total demotion into serfdom .

Actually , 28 of these giant snakes have been found . Since I am a geological engineer , PRP was even more interesting for me to tour Jaramillo 's most recent project at DT Panama Canal . Massive JJ excavations to allow DT NN 's biggest ships to pass through via a third , larger set of locks have exposed geological formations WDT date back 17 million NNS and given Jaramillo an opportunity to help solve a puzzle : how and when DT land bridge connecting North and South America formed . Jaramillo 's group collects newly uncovered fossils and compares them with fossils found in North America from DT same NN period . DT comparisons should shed light on DT formation of DT Isthmus of Panama , which began about 20 million NNS ago ; DT closure of DT isthmus some three million NNS ago launched two of our NN 's great experiments in biodiversity . DT first , DT Great American Interchange , began when DT fauna and flora of North America invaded South America and vice versa across DT newly formed land bridge . DT second began when DT isthmus formed a barrier , dividing marine organisms into Caribbean and eastern Pacific populations . During my visit to STRI , I RB took in DT cacophonous whoops of howler monkeys and rode high above DT forest canopy in a research gondola held aloft by a construction crane ; I observed butterfly aerobatics and working ant colonies . STRI 's focus is Barro Colorado Island , located in DT canal 's Gatun Lake ; its 1,316 plant species , 381 bird species and 115 mammal species are among DT NN 's most intensively studied . Institute NNS are illuminating how forests capture carbon from DT atmosphere , studying DT NN of coral reefs and documenting invasive species . This and other STRI NN will inform exhibits at DT Smithsonian - affiliated Museum of Biodiversity ( BioMuseo ) next to STRI labs at DT Pacific end of DT canal . Designed by Frank Gehry , DT JJ museum will open next NN , just in NN to celebrate DT Smithsonian 's 100 - NN partnership with Panama . Those among PRP less interested in geology might still be wondering about DT snakes . Not to worry . PRP preferred eating crocodiles and giant turtles . And DT discovery was of snake fossils ( mostly backbones ) in DT remote jungles of Colombia ; DT snakes , called Titanoboas , lived some 60 million NNS ago . G.

A_DT contemporary_JJ offshoot_NN of_IN dubstep_NN heavily_RB influenced_VBN by_IN UK_NNP garage_NN is_VBZ future_JJ garage_NN ._.","UK garage , RB known as UKG , is a genre of electronic music which originated in England in DT early 1990s . DT genre blends styles such as garage house , R&B , jungle and dance - pop . PRP usually features a percussive , shuffled 4/ 4 breakbeat rhythm with syncopated hi-hats , cymbals and snares , and sometimes includes irregular kick drum patterns . Garage tracks RB commonly feature ' chopped up ' and NN - stretched or pitch - shifted vocal samples complementing DT underlying rhythmic structure at a tempo usually around 130 BPM . UK garage gave rise to subgenres such as speed garage and 2 - step , and was then largely subsumed into other styles of music and production in DT mid-2000s , including bassline , grime and dubstep . DT decline of UK garage during DT mid-2000s saw DT birth of UK funky , which is closely related . DT evolution of house music in DT NNP Kingdom in DT mid-1990s led to DT term , as previously coined by DT Paradise Garage DJs , being applied to a JJ form of music RB known speed garage . Its originator is widely recognised to be Todd Edwards , DT American house and garage producer , RB known as Todd "" DT God "" Edwards [ citation needed ] . In DT early nineties , Edwards began to start remixing more soulful house records and incorporating more NN - shifts and vocal samples than normal house records , whilst still living in DT NNP . However , PRP was not until DJ EZ , DT North London DJ , acquired CD of Edwards ' tracks and played PRP at a faster tempo in a nightclub in Greenwich , IN DT music genre really took off . In DT late nineties , DT term "" UK garage "" was settled upon by DT scene . This style is now frequently combined with other forms of music IN soul , rap , reggae , ragga and R&B , all broadly filed under DT description of urban music . DT pronunciation of UK garage uses GARR - ij , rather than gə-rahzh . [ 1 ] Artists such as Craig David , Grant Nelson , MJ Cole , Artful Dodger , Jaimeson , So Solid Crew , Heartless Crew , DT Streets , Shanks & Bigfoot , DJ Luck & MC Neat , Sunship ( Ceri Evans ) , Oxide and Neutrino and numerous others have made garage music mainstream in DT UK , whilst Dizzee Rascal , Wiley and Kano 's arrival raised DT profile of grime , an offshoot of garage . Cole once stated , "" London is a multicultural city ... PRP 's IN a melting pot of young NNS , and DT 's reflected in DT music of UK garage "" . [ 2 ] Notable female singers who have had DT genre incorporated into their songs include Lisa Maffia , Ms. Dynamite , Kele Le Roc , Shola Ama , Sweet Female Attitude and Mis-Teeq . In DT NNP Kingdom , where jungle was very popular at DT NN , garage was played in a second room at jungle events . After jungle 's peak in cultural significance , PRP had turned towards a harsher , more techstep influenced sound , driving away dancers , predominantly women . Escaping DT 170 bpm jungle basslines , DT garage rooms had a much more sensual and soulful sound at 130 b pm . [ 3 ] DJs started to speed up garage tracks to make them more suitable for DT jungle audience in DT UK . DT NN started to call this tempo-altered type of garage music "" speed garage "" , 4x4 and 2 - step 's predecessor . DJs MD usually play dub versions ( arrangements without vocals ) of garage tracks , because pitch - shifting vocals MD sometimes render DT music unrecognizable ( although sped up and NN - stretched vocals were an important part of DT early jungle sound , and later played a key role in speed garage ) . DT absence of vocals left space in DT music for MCs , who started rhyming to DT records . Since then , MCs have become CD of DT vital aspects of speed and UK garage parties and records . Early promoters of speed garage included DT Dreem Teem and Tuff Jam , and pirate radio stations such as London Underground , Magic FM , Upfront FM , and Freek FM . During its initial phase , DT speed garage scene was RB known as "" DT Sunday Scene "" , as initially speed garage promoters MD only hire venues on Sunday evenings ( venue owners preferred to save Friday and Saturday nights for more popular musical styles ) . Labels whose outputs MD become synonymous with DT emerging speed garage sound included Confetti , JJ Demand , 500 Rekords , Spread Love and VIP . Speed garage already incorporated JJ aspects of today 's UK garage sound IN sub - bass lines , ragga vocals , spin backs and reversed drums . What changed over NN , until DT so - called 2 - step sound emerged , was DT addition of further funky elements IN contemporary R&B styled vocals , more shuffled beats and a different drum pattern . DT most radical NN from speed garage to 2 - step was DT removal of DT 2nd and 4th bass kick from each bar . Although tracks with only two kick drum beats to a bar are perceived as being slower than DT traditional four - to - DT - floor beat , DT listener 's interest is maintained by DT introduction of syncopating bass lines and DT percussive use of other instruments such as pads and strings . Speed garage tracks were characterised by a sped - up house - style beat , complemented by DT rolling snares and reverse - warped basslines WDT were popular with drum and bass producers of DT NN . Among those credited with honing DT speed garage sound , Todd Edwards is often cited as a seminal influence on DT UK garage sound . DT producer from NNP Jersey introduced a JJ way of working with vocals . Instead of having full verses and choruses , he picked out vocal phrases and played them IN an instrument , using sampling technology . [ 4 ] Often , individual syllables were reversed or pitch - shifted . This type of vocal treatment is still a key characteristic of DT UK garage style . Armand Van Helden 's speed garage remix of Sneaker Pimps ' "" Spin Spin Sugar "" in 1997 further popularized DT genre which is sometimes credited with breaking speed garage into DT mainstream . Huge club hits in 1997 came from speed garage duos Double 99 , 187 Lockdown and Industry Standard . DT former two both scored UK Top 20 hits in 1997 and 1998 ; Double 99's "" RipGroove "" reached # 14 in its second release and 187 Lockdown 's "" Gunman "" and "" Kung - Fu "" reached # 16 and # 9 , respectively . Industry Standard scored a Top 40 hit with "" Vol. 1 ( What PRP VBP What PRP Need ) "" peaking at # 34 in January 1998 , [5 ] and DT 1997 XL Recordings release of Somore featuring Damon Trueitt 's "" I Refuse ( What PRP VBP ) "" reached # 21 RB in January 1998 , [ 6 ] containing mixes by Industry Standard , Ramsey & Fen , R.I.P. Productions and Serious Danger . DT UK's counterpart to Todd Edwards was MJ Cole , a classically trained oboe and piano player , who had a string of chart and underground hits in DT late 1990s and early 2000s , most notably with "" Sincere "" and "" Crazy Love "" . MJ Cole has RB won a BBC "" Young Musician of DT NNP "" award . [ 7 ] Arguably CD of DT earliest examples of a 2 - step track is DT 1997 hit "" Never Gonna Let PRP VB "" by Tina Moore , which peaked at # 7 on DT UK chart . Roy Davis Jr. was RB influential in DT UK garage scene , with DT huge club hit "" Gabriel "" featuring Peven Everett , released in 1997 on XL Recordings and reaching # 22 on DT UK chart . Lovestation released their version of "" Teardrops "" which reached # 14 in 1998 . Doolally , DT former name of Shanks & Bigfoot , scored a # 20 hit in 1998 with "" Straight from DT Heart "" . A re-release of this song DT following NN fared even better , peaking at # 9 , due to DT success of their # 1 single "" Sweet JJ Chocolate "" . Jess Jackson was responsible for JJ garage records but CD which stood out was "" Hobson 's Choice "" . DT B - side of this record changed DT UK garage scene from funky and soulful to dark and bassy . Another example of DT evolution in 2 - step was DT release of "" Troublesome "" in 1999 by Shy Cookie and DJ Luck , in which non-sampled 2 - step beats were merged with a full ragga vocal ( performed by ragga artist Troublesome ) . Timbaland , a popular contemporary R&B producer in America , was DT major innovator behind contemporary R&B at DT NN , from which UK rave culture borrowed heavily . DT use of rhythmic patterns as melodic hooks is shared by both contemporary R&B and jungle , making PRP very appealing to DT significantly ex-junglist UK garage scene . This style of Timbaland 's R&B possesses a breakbeat aesthetic : breakup of DT flow of four - to - DT - floor rhythm , hesitations into DT groove , and teasing and tantalizing gaps . As much as these R&B influences can be heard in early UK garage , DT genre offered more complex drum beats , with heavy syncopation ( swing ) and a more energetic feel due to a higher tempo ( normally between 130 and 138 BPM ) . However , in tracks IN "" Twentyfourseven "" by Artful Dodger , a slower and simpler R&B infused drum pattern can be heard . This was to allow for these tracks to be aimed at a more commercial scene rather than for DT dance floor . Garage producers then proceeded to churn out UK versions of NNP contemporary R&B hits , notably with Brandy and Monica 's "" DT Boy Is Mine "" . DT Architechs sped up DT vocals through NN - stretching and added sound effects to increase DT competitive nature . "" B& M Remix "" eventually sold twenty thousand copies as a bootleg . [ 3 ] RB borrowed from NNP contemporary R&B is DT use of "" vocal NN "" , DT technique of digitally altering vocal samples with devices such as DT Autotuner . What results is a posthuman mix between person and technology . [ 3 ] With DT continued support of pirate radio stations such as Rinse FM , NNP FM , Deja Vu , and Flex FM , DT soaring popularity of UK garage saw 1999 take DT genre into DT mainstream , breaking into DT music charts . Production duos Shanks & Bigfoot and Artful Dodger were very successful with DT tracks "" Sweet JJ Chocolate "" and "" Re- Rewind "" , respectively . After DT platinum - selling success of "" Sweet JJ Chocolate "" , DT floodgates had opened . Although "" Re- Rewind "" was denied a # 1 position by Cliff Richard and his song "" DT Millennium Prayer "" , PRP was RB a platinum seller , CD of DT garage scene 's first and last . PRP became anthems for DT 2 - step scene , and got onto BBC's Top of DT Pops . Other huge hits in 1999 include DT # 1 house / garage anthem "" PRP Don't VB Me "" by Armand Van Helden . Although not UK garage , Mr. Oizo's # 1 single "" Flat Beat "" received extensive airplay on pirate radio stations upon release , thus leading to numerous UK garage / 2 - step remixes of DT track . Da Click ( Pied Piper , MC Creed , PSG , Unknown MC and singer Valerie M ) had a # 14 hit with "" Good Rhymes "" . Garage trio DT Dreem Teem had a # 15 hit with "" Buddy X 99 "" , a garage remix of Neneh Cherry 's 1992 song "" Buddy X "" . DJ Luck & MC Neat RB had a chart hit with "" A Little Bit of Luck "" in late 1999 into early 2000 . JJ more UK garage acts followed into DT JJ millennium by releasing commercially successful singles , thus making UK garage and 2 - step a stable fixture on DT UK charts for DT next couple of NNS . Debut singles of various UK garage artists were hitting DT number CD spot on DT UK charts . Craig David 's debut solo single "" Fill Me In "" , a mix of R&B and 2 - step , with single formats containing various garage remixes of DT track , hit # 1 in April 2000 . A month later , Oxide & Neutrino 's "" Bound 4 Da Reload ( Casualty ) "" reached DT top of DT charts . Other hits in 2000 include Artful Dodger 's "" Movin ' Too Fast "" ( # 2 ) , "" Woman Trouble "" ( # 6 ) and "" Please Don't Turn Me On "" ( # 4 ) , Sweet Female Attitude 's "" Flowers "" ( # 2 ) , True Steppers ' "" Buggin "" ( # 6 ) and "" Out of Your Mind "" ( # 2 ) , N'n 'G featuring Kallaghan and MC Neat 's "" Right Before My Eyes "" ( # 12 ) , DJ Dee Kline 's "" I Don't Smoke "" ( #11 ) , B - 15 Project 's "" Girls IN NNP "" ( # 7 ) , DJ Luck & MC Neat 's "" Masterblaster 2000 "" ( # 5 ) and "" Ain't No Stoppin ' PRP "" ( # 8 ) , Shanks & Bigfoot 's "" Sing - A - Long "" ( # 12 ) , MJ Cole 's "" Crazy Love "" ( #10 ) and "" Sincere "" ( #13 ) , DT latter a re-release , having been originally released in 1998 ; Scott & Leon 's "" PRP Used to Hold Me "" ( # CD ) , Wookie 's "" Battle "" ( #10 ) , Lonyo's "" Summer of Love "" ( # 8 ) , Tru Faith & Dub NNP 's "" Freak IN Me "" ( # 12 ) , Architechs ' "" Body Groove "" ( # 3 ) , Oxide & Neutrino 's "" No Good 4 Me "" ( # 6 ) and Baby D's "" Let Me Be Your Fantasy "" ( # 16 ) , a garage remix by Trick or Treat featuring MC Tails . Another huge hit in 2000 was DT Timo Maas remix of DT song "" Dooms Night "" ( # 8 ) by German producer Azzido Da Bass , which was heavily associated with UK garage at DT NN , having become a major club hit and appearing on several UK garage compilations . PRP was RB remixed by garage duo Stanton Warriors . [ 7 ] 2001 gave DJ Pied Piper and DT Masters of Ceremonies their CD and only number CD hit record with "" Do PRP Really VB PRP ? "" . Two months later in August 2001 , South London collective So Solid Crew hit DT top spot with their second single "" 21 Seconds "" . DT end of 2001 saw yet another 2 - step anthem reach DT top of DT UK charts for Daniel Bedingfield , with his debut single "" Gotta VB Thru This "" . Other chart hits in 2001 include DT Sunship mixes of Mis-Teeq 's "" Why "" ( # 8 ) , "" All I VBP "" ( # 2 ) and "" NNP Night Stand "" ( # 5 ) , Artful Dodger 's "" VB About Me "" ( #11 ) , "" TwentyFourSeven "" ( # 6 ) and "" PRP Ain't Enough "" with DT Dreem Teem ( # 20 ) , Genius Cru's "" Boom Selection "" ( # 12 ) , Liberty 's "" Thinking PRP Over "" ( # 5 ) , Sticky featuring Ms. Dynamite 's "" Booo ! "" ( # 12 ) , Oxide & Neutrino 's "" Up Middle Finger "" ( # 7 ) , "" Devil 's Nightmare "" ( # 16 ) and "" Rap Dis "" / "" Only Wanna VB U Cos Ure Famous "" ( # 12 ) , DJ Luck & MC Neat 's "" Piano Loco "" ( # 12 ) and "" I'm All About PRP "" ( # 18 ) , DT Streets ' "" Has PRP Come to This ? "" ( # 18 ) , Wideboys ' "" Sambuca "" ( #15 ) , and So Solid Crew 's "" PRP Don't VBP "" ( # 3 ) . 2002 saw an evolution as 2 - step moved away from its funky and soul - oriented sound into a darker direction called "" grime "" , now a genre in its own right . During this period , traditional UK garage was pushed back underground amongst DT bad publicity emanating from DT tougher side of DT genre , and publicised violence surrounding members of DT So Solid Crew . Nonetheless , several UK garage songs did appear on DT charts from 2002 to 2004 , including Distant Soundz ' version of "" NNP After NNP "" ( # 20 ) , So Solid Crew 's "" Haters "" ( #8 ) and "" Ride wid PRP "" ( #19 ) , Mis-Teeq 's "" B with Me "" ( # 5 ) , Heartless Crew 's "" DT Heartless Theme "" ( # 21 ) , Pay As U Go's "" Champagne Dance "" ( #13 ) , Jaimeson 's "" True "" ( # 4 ) , Mr Reds vs DJ Skribble 's "" Everybody Come On ( Can U Feel PRP ) "" ( #13 ) , and 3 of a Kind 's "" Baby Cakes "" which was a number CD hit in August 2004 . Notable early grime artists around 2001 –03 include Ruff Sqwad , More Fire Crew , Dizzee Rascal ( who released his debut album Boy in da Corner in 2003 ) , Roll Deep and Wiley . During this NN , EX was RB a strong division of class in UK garage . In DT heyday of garage , DT late 1990s , PRP was a highly aspirational genre . When NNS went to DT club to hear garage , PRP dressed very nice . Clubs IN Twice as Nice enforced a dress code . Having a formal dress code took DT importance placed on nice clothes from a style to exclusionary . DT dress code in clubs IN Twice as Nice were meant to "" encourage NNS to make an effort "" and "" keep trouble out . "" But when DT dress code of no tennis shoes , jeans , or baseball caps only kept white college students out , DT club installed a metal detector , because "" gangstas VBP to dress expensive , "" but theoretically MD still carry a gun . [ 3 ] Eventually , when groups IN So Solid Crew attracted more urban , lower - class audiences to raves because of their lyrics over DT garage tracks , garage began to transition to grime because previous audiences were less likely to listen , so radios and clubs stopped giving garage opportunities . [ 8 ] In 2007 , several DJs helped promote and revive UK garage 's popularity , with producers creating JJ UK garage , RB known as "" JJ skool "" UK garage or "" bassline "" . DT end of 2007 saw "" JJ skool "" UK garage push to DT mainstream again with notable tracks such as T2's "" Heartbroken "" and H "" Two "" O's "" What 's PRP Gonna Be "" both reaching DT mainstream charts . DT revival was galvanised by DJ EZ releasing Pure Garage Rewind : Back to DT Old Skool , which contained three CDs of "" old skool "" UK garage and a fourth CD with fresh "" JJ skool "" UK garage . Early 2011 saw DT start of a gradual resurgence of 2 - step garage . [ 9 ] Producers such as Wookie , MJ Cole , Zed Bias and Mark Hill ( formerly CD half of Artful Dodger ) made a return to DT scene , by producing tracks with more of a 2 - step feel . Electronic music duos Disclosure and AlunaGeorge , both successful throughout 2012 and 2013 , often use elements of UK garage in their music , and arguably , some of their biggest hits including "" PRP & Me "" and "" PRP Are Chosen "" respectively , are entirely 2 - step with an updated cleaner sound . Shortly following this , "" original "" style garage had made a return in a big way , with producers such as Moony , DJD and Tuff Culture paving DT way . CD of DT genre 's pioneering labels , NNP Cream Records , responsible for anthems such as "" RipGroove "" , True Steppers ' "" Out of Your Mind "" , Kele Le Roc 's "" My Love "" and more , opened up their permanent roster for DT first NN to include DJs outside of DT legendary trio WDT launched DT label . AJ Tracey 's song "" Ladbroke Grove "" initially debuted at number 48 on DT UK Singles Chart in February 2019 , then eventually peaked at number three in October 2019 following its release as a single . In September 2019 , DT British Phonographic Industry certified DT song as Platinum for exceeding chart sales of 600,000 . PRP was CD of DT best - selling songs of 2019 . [ 10 ] Other hits in DT 2010s include Toddla T's "" Take PRP Back "" , All About She 's "" Higher ( Free ) "" , Naughty Boy 's "" La La La "" , Shift K3Y 's "" Touch "" , Chase & Status ' "" Blk & Blu "" , M.O's "" Dance On My Own "" , Disclosure 's "" Omen "" and Craig David 's "" When DT Bassline Drops "" and "" CD More NNP "" . DT dark garage sound WDT was being produced by DT likes of Wookie , Zed Bias , Shy Cookie , El - B and Artwork ( of DND ) in DT late 1990s MD set DT groundwork for both grime and a genre called dubstep . Developing in parallel to grime , dubstep MD take a mostly instrumental stripped down form of dark garage and with PRP bring in production values and influences from dub reggae . Some UK garage / dubstep / grime / bassline producers have moved to a different sound called UK funky , which takes production values from JJ different shades of soulful house music with elements of UK garage and blends them at a standard house music tempo , and soca with tribal style percussion from afrobeat . A contemporary offshoot of dubstep heavily influenced by UK garage is future garage ."

Consolidated Edison spokesman Chris Olert VBD Monday evening IN DT power was out for most of Manhattan south of 26th Street . On DT east side , DT power outage extended from 29th Street south . EX were some scattered areas WDT still had electricity . Olert VBD DT damage stemmed from flooding and DT probable loss of a transmission feeder . DT power outage was separate from a planned power cut WDT Con Ed did in certain lower Manhattan neighborhoods to protect underwater systems from flood damage . Olert VBD EX were 250,000 customers without power in Manhattan . A customer represents a single meter , so DT number of NNS actually affected is likely higher . THIS IS A BREAKING NN UPDATE . Check back soon for further information . AP ’s earlier story is below . Superstorm Sandy zeroed in on NNP York ’s waterfront with fierce rain and winds WDT shuttered most of DT nation ’s largest city Monday , darkened DT financial district and left a huge crane hanging off a luxury high - rise . DT threat of a record 13 - foot storm surge inundating downtown Manhattan prompted officials to close DT mass transit system and cut power pre-emptively to parts of downtown Manhattan to avoid damage from incoming seawater . “ DT worst of PRP is about to hit , ” Mayor Michael Bloomberg VBD Monday evening before Sandy , stripped of its hurricane status but just as strong and dangerous , made landfall in southern NNP Jersey . NN began lapping over DT lower Manhattan seawall earlier , about ankle - deep , as officials anxiously awaited high tide . NN began pooling in rail yards and on highways near DT Hudson River waterfront on Manhattan ’s far west side . On coastal Long Island , floodwaters swamped cars , downed trees and put neighborhoods under NN as beachfronts and fishing villages bore DT brunt of DT storm . A police car was lost rescuing 14 NNS from DT popular resort Fire Island . DT storm had only killed CD NNP Yorker by Monday night , a man who died when a tree fell on his home in DT Flushing section of Queens . DT collapsed crane suspended over midtown caused DT evacuation of hundreds from a posh hotel and other buildings . Inspectors were climbing 74 flights of stairs to examine PRP . Meteorologists VBD DT winds MD have been close to 95 mph at DT top of DT $ 1.5 billion building when DT crane tipped . DT facade of a four - story Manhattan building in DT Chelsea neighborhood crumbled and collapsed suddenly , leaving DT lights , couches , cabinets and desks inside visible from DT street . No NN was hurt , although some of DT falling debris hit a car . DT city shut its subways , schools , stock exchanges , Broadway theaters and closed several bridges and tunnels throughout DT day as DT weather worsened . Late Monday , DT Port Authority of NNP York and NNP Jersey closed LaGuardia Airport , although major carriers had cancelled all their flights hours earlier . Consolidated Edison cut power pre-emptively to parts of Manhattan bordered by DT Brooklyn Bridge and DT East River , trying to lessen damage to underground equipment from DT massive storm , spokesman Chris Olert VBD . About 6,500 customers lost power , he VBD ; DT utility reported more than 65,000 outages from DT storm in DT city and suburban Westchester County . Earlier , some NNP Yorkers defiantly soldiered on , trying to salvage normal routines and refusing to evacuate , as DT mayor ordered 375,000 in low - lying areas to do . Mark Vial pushed a stroller holding his 2 - NN - old daughter Maziyar toward his apartment building in Battery Park City , an area WDT was ordered evacuated . “ PRP ’re high up enough , so I ’m not worried about flooding , ” VBD Via , 35 . “ EX ’s plenty of food . PRP ’ll be OK . But by early evening , DT NN in NNP York Harbor was rising and winds sent a trash can blowing down DT street in Battery Park City . Brian Damianakes , 47 , took shelter in an ATM vestibule . “ I decided to VB for a run about five minutes ago but now I ’m thinking maybe not , ” he VBD . “ Now PRP ’s really turning into something . ” On NNP York ’s Long Island , floodwaters had begun to deluge some low - lying towns and nearly 150,000 customers had lost power . Cars floated along DT streets of Long Beach and flooding consumed several blocks south of DT bay , residents VBD . Gov. Andrew Cuomo , holding a NN conference on Long Island where DT lights flickered and his mike went in and out , VBD most of DT National Guards deployed to DT NNP York City area MD VB to Long Island . “ Long Island has become more and more vulnerable and DT primary area of our concentration , ” he VBD . In DT fishing village of Greenport , Sean Seal piled dirt and sandbags onto DT alleyway behind his collectibles store where DT NN was steadily creeping up DT street toward his front door . He only opened DT shop about two months ago . “ PRP put everything up . Up on tables , up on shelves , as far as PRP MD , ” he VBD . “ PRP ’s gonna be devastating . PRP ’ll lose a lot of stuff . ” Anoush Vargas drove with her husband , Michael to DT famed Jones Beach Monday morning , only to find PRP covered by NN . “ PRP have no more beach . PRP ’s gone , ” she VBD , shaking her head as she watched DT waves VB under DT boardwalk . DT center DT storm , a combination of Sandy , a wintry system from DT West and cold air streaming from DT Arctic , was expected to hit DT city under a full moon later Monday night . Surging waters of between 6 and 11 feet MD flood subway tunnels , knock out DT underground network of power , phone and high - speed Internet lines WDT are DT lifeblood of America ’s financial capital . Waters rose , but had n’t breached DT seawall by early Monday evening . Despite DT dire forecasts , JJ chose to embrace what was coming . Tanja Stewart and her 7 - NN - old son , Finn , came from their home in Manhattan ’s TriBeCa neighborhood to admire DT white caps on DT Hudson , Finn wearing a pair of binoculars around his neck . “ I really wanted to see some big waves , ” he VBD . Nearby , Keith Reilly climbed up on a rail next to DT rising waters of NNP York Harbor so his friend Eli Rowe MD snap a photo of him in an Irish soccer jersey with DT Statue of Liberty in DT background . “ This is not so bad right now , ” VBD DT 25 - NN - old Reilly . “ PRP ’ll see later . ” And NNP Yorkers Andrew Rotz and Alex Grvymala , two young investment bankers on DT Battery , wearing shorts and t- shirts , were jogging all over Lower Manhattan . Rotz VBD PRP wanted to blow off some NN before DT storm hit . source – AP"

When this happens , your bones increase in size , including those of your hands , feet and face . Acromegaly usually affects middle - aged adults . Acromegaly usually affects middle - aged adults , though PRP can develop at any age . In NNS who are still growing , too much growth hormone can cause a condition called gigantism . These NNS have exaggerated bone growth and an abnormal increase in height . Because acromegaly is uncommon and physical changes occur gradually , DT condition sometimes takes a long NN to recognize . If PRP 's not treated promptly , acromegaly can lead to serious illness and MD even become life - threatening . But available treatments can reduce your risk of complications and significantly improve characteristics of DT condition , including DT enlargement of your features . A common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet . NNS with this disorder often notice IN PRP are n't able to put on rings WDT used to fit and IN their shoe size has progressively increased . Acromegaly MD RB cause gradual changes in DT shape of your face , such as a protruding lower jaw and brow , an enlarged nose , thickened lips , and wider spacing between your teeth . Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly , early signs MD not be obvious for NNS . Sometimes , NNS notice DT condition only by comparing old photographs with newer ones . Acromegaly MD produce DT following signs and symptoms , which can vary from CD person to another : • Severe snoring due to obstruction of DT upper airway • Enlarged organs , such as DT heart When to see a doctor If PRP have signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly , contact your doctor for an evaluation . Acromegaly usually develops slowly . Even your family members MD not initially notice DT gradual physical changes WDT occur with this disorder , but early diagnosis is important so IN PRP can start getting proper care . Acromegaly can lead to serious complications if PRP 's not treated . Acromegaly is caused by DT pituitary gland overproducing growth hormone ( GH ) over NN . DT pituitary gland , a small gland situated at DT base of your brain behind DT bridge of your nose , produces a number of hormones . GH plays an important role in managing your physical growth . When GH is secreted into your bloodstream , PRP triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin - JJ growth factor - I ( IGF - I ) . In turn , IGF - I stimulates DT growth of bones and other tissues . If your pituitary gland makes too much GH , excessive amounts of IGF - I can result . Too much IGF - I can cause abnormal growth of your soft tissues and skeleton and other signs and symptoms characteristic of acromegaly and gigantism . In adults , a tumor is DT most common cause of too much GH production : • Pituitary tumors . Most NNS of acromegaly are caused by a noncancerous ( benign ) tumor ( adenoma ) of DT pituitary gland . DT tumor secretes excessive amounts of growth hormone , causing JJ of DT signs and symptoms of acromegaly . Some of DT symptoms of acromegaly , such as headaches and impaired vision , are due to DT tumor mass pressing on nearby brain tissues . • Nonpituitary tumors . In a few NNS with acromegaly , tumors in other parts of DT body , such as DT lungs or pancreas , cause DT disorder . Sometimes , these tumors secrete GH . In other NNS , DT tumors produce a hormone called growth hormone - releasing hormone ( GH - RH ) , which stimulates DT pituitary gland to make more GH . Progression of acromegaly can result in major NN problems . Complications MD include : • Cardiovascular NN , particularly enlargement of DT heart ( cardiomyopathy ) • Precancerous growths ( polyps ) on DT lining of your colon • Sleep apnea , a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep Early treatment of acromegaly can prevent these complications from developing or becoming worse . Untreated , acromegaly and its complications can lead to premature death ."

Legs and feet of birds play important roles in walking ( most species ) , running ( ostriches , grouse , turkeys ) , climbing ( woodpeckers , nuthatches , tree‐creepers ) , swimming and steering underwater ( ducks , grebes , loons ) , perching ( as on a branch ) or clinging ( Elphick et al. , 2001 ; Kochan , 1994 ; Proctor & Lynch , 1993 ) . Other functions include carrying ( IN ospreys Pandion haliaetus holding fish ) and flight ‐related locomotion ( Elphick et al. , 2001 ; Kochan , 1994 ; Proctor & Lynch , 1993 ) . Feeding and related functions of feet include capture and killing of prey and pulling apart food ( with help from DT bill ) . Some grebes MD even run on NN for mate acquisition ( Clifton , Hedrick , & Biewener , 2015 ) . Webbed feet are characteristic features of bird species living in aquatic habitats ( Elphick et al. , 2001 ; Kochan , 1994 ; Proctor & Lynch , 1993 ) . NN ducks rely on both webbed feet and wings for diving , sweeping their webbed feet backwards ( Richman & Lovvorn , 2008 ) . Loons Gavia immer swim by paddling their feet laterally as in grebes and cormorants ( Clifton & Biewener , 2018 ) . Eiders use both wing and foot propulsion during descent . DT power face of foot strokes coincides with DT transition between upstroke and downstroke of DT wings ( Heath , Gilchrist , & Ydenberg , 2006 ) . DT delta shape of their webbed feet is able to generate propulsive forces from drag at DT start of DT stroke of DT feet to DT lift later in DT stroke ( Johansson & Norberg , 2003 ) . Some NN ducks use both feet and wings to swim ( Richman & Lovvorn , 2008 ) . DT use of both feet and wings increased bottom duration by 59 % compared to dives with feet only with potential consequences for ingestion rate ( Richman & Lovvorn , 2008 ) . Webbed feet are often large , and PRP show considerable variation in size among individuals ( A. P. Møller pers. obs. ) , raising DT question what is DT basis for such variation . Surprisingly , EX is no publication dealing with DT consequences of intraspecific variation in size of webbed feet , and this deficit prompted our NN . If large feet are beneficial , PRP assume IN a larger foot size is associated with a larger locomotor apparatus such as a larger wing area and a larger heart . Although EX is a genetic basis for DT size of webbed feet ( Ganan , Macias , Basco , Merino , & Hurle , 1998 ) , and DT varied and important roles WDT feet play across bird species , EX is currently a significant lack of understanding of DT functional significance of foot size . Eiders are well ‐known capital breeders ( relying on stored food throughout DT incubation period ) WDT build up body reserves during winter for subsequent breeding in spring and early summer ( Meijer & Drent , 1999 ) . Female eiders arrive during spring entering colonies and producing a clutch of 4– 5 eggs WDT are incubated for about 26 days . DT female sits on DT nest during this period without feeding . Therefore , females must build up sufficient body reserves for breeding at DT wintering grounds and off DT breeding grounds ( Hobson , Jaatinen , & Öst , 2015 ) . During winter , eiders are located off shore in large flocks feeding on benthos at 4 – 8 m depth , with a range of 0 – 20 m ( Petersen et al. , 2010 ) . In DT prebreeding period , PRP stay near DT shore feeding in shallow NN . Studies in DT Wadden NNP have shown IN DT number of eiders increases with mussel stocks , and individuals feeding on mussels have superior body condition than those taking other types of prey , which makes PRP attractive for eiders to feed on mussel beds ( Laursen , Asferg , Frikke , & Sunde , 2009 ; Laursen & Frikke , 2008 ; Nehls & Ketzenberg , 2002 ) . Blue mussels ( Mytilus edulis ) can affect feeding condition of eiders by increasing flesh content and by increasing DT size of mussel stocks ( Laursen , Møller , Haugaard , Öst , & Vainio , 2019 . DT objectives of this NN were to test ( a ) whether intraspecific variation in DT size of webbed feet is related to DT size of DT locomotor apparatus as reflected by wings and its underlying muscular basis in heart and breast muscle ; ( b ) whether DT diet is related to DT area of DT webbed feet , and hence whether DT size of DT liver as a storage organ increases with DT area of DT webbed feet . Vitamin E is DT main fat ‐soluble antioxidant stored in DT liver ( Møller , Laursen , & Karadas , 2019 ) . Larger webbed feet MD imply greater diving ability and hence a reduction in DT amount of stored vitamin E ( Møller et al. , 2019 ) . Finally , ( c ) if birds with larger webbed feet acquire more food per unit NN , this should result in a reduction in DT duration of DT molting period which again MD result in a reduction in DT duration of exposure to predators such as white ‐tailed NN eagle Haliaeetus albicilla WDT is DT main cause of mortality . Viain , Guillemette , and Savard ( 2015 ) showed IN eiders had lower flight muscle reduction than foot ‐propelled diving ducks during molt , apparently as a means of maintenance of DT ability to escape from predators . PRP tested whether DT size of DT uropygial gland WDT is involved in feather maintenance and anti‐microbial activity increases with DT area of webbed feet . Because effects of larger webbed feet MD be confounded by effects of body size , PRP included DT first principal component as a measure of skeletal body size in DT statistical analyses . PRP used a sample of 233 eiders ( Somateria mollissima ) shot during 2015 – 2018 in Danish waters during winter ( January ‐ February ; N = 182 ) and at prebreeding grounds at Åland , Finland in DT central part of DT Baltic NNP ( April–May ; N = 51 ) to test these predictions ."

DT release and alleged NN by Melba S. Ketchum RB suggests such cryptids had sex with modern human females WDT resulted in hairy hominin hybrids -- but DT scientific community is dubious about her claim . "" A team of NNS can verify IN their five - NN long DNA NN , currently under peer - review , confirms DT existence of a novel hominin hybrid species , commonly called ' Bigfoot ' or ' Sasquatch , ' living in North America , "" DT release reads . "" Researchers ' extensive DNA sequencing suggests IN DT legendary Sasquatch is a human relative WDT arose approximately 15,000 NNS ago . "" For her NN , Ketchum obtained three "" whole nuclear genomes from purported Sasquatch samples . DT genome sequencing shows IN Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens , but Sasquatch nuDNA is a novel , unknown hominin related to Homo sapiens and other primate species . "" ( Mitochondrial DNA , or mtDNA , is DT DNA WDT resides in DT cell 's NN - producing structures , and is typically passed down from mothers , while nuclear DNA , nuDNA , resides in DT cells ' nuclei and is passed down from both parents to offspring . ) "" Our data indicate IN DT North American Sasquatch is a hybrid species , DT result of males of an unknown hominin species crossing with female Homo sapiens , "" DT statement reads . [ Infographic : Tracking Belief in Bigfoot ] So where 's DT evidence ? Well , EX is none . Not yet , anyway : Ketchum 's research has not appeared in any peer - reviewed scientific journal , and EX 's no indication when DT might happen . If DT data are good and DT NN is sound , any reputable NN journal MD jump at DT chance to be DT first to publish this groundbreaking information . Until then , Ketchum has refused to let anyone else see her evidence . Of course DT history of Bigfoot is rife with exaggerated and premature claims about proof of DT creature 's existence . For decades , various types of evidence have been offered as final , definitive proof , ranging from Bigfoot hair to blood to dead bodies . Without exception , DT evidence has always been hoaxed , misidentification or inconclusive . Because Ketchum has released no information at all about her findings ( nor have PRP been examined by outside experts ) , PRP 's impossible to evaluate DT validity of her conclusions . But an important clue can be found in her statement IN "" Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens . "" If DT mitochontrial DNA is identical to Homo sapiens ( i.e. , modern humans ) , then this suggests CD of two options . DT first , endorsed by Ketchum , is IN Bigfoot ancestors had sex with women about 15,000 NNS ago and created a half - human hybrid species currently hiding across North America . [ Rumor or Reality : DT Creatures of Cryptozoology ] EX is , however , another , simpler interpretation of such results : DT samples were contaminated . Whatever DT sample originally was — Bigfoot , bear , human or something else — PRP 's possible IN DT NNS who collected and handled DT specimens accidentally introduced their DNA into DT sample , which can easily occur with something as innocent as a spit , sneeze or cough . No NN outside of Ketchum 's team knows how this alleged Bigfoot DNA was collected , from where or by whom . PRP MD have been collected by DT NN 's top forensics experts , or by a pair of amateur Bigfoot buffs with no evidence - gathering training . How did DT team definitively determine IN DT samples were from a Bigfoot ? Did PRP take a blood or saliva sample from a living Bigfoot ? If so , how did PRP VB DT close , and why did n't PRP simply capture PRP or photograph PRP ? If DT samples were found in DT wild , how do PRP VB PRP was n't left by another animal — or possibly even a hunter , hiker or camper who left human genetic material ? Previous alleged Bigfoot samples subjected to DNA analysis have been deemed "" unknown "" or "" unidentified . "" However , "" unknown "" or "" unidentified "" results do not mean "" Bigfoot . "" EX are JJ reasons why a DNA sample might come back unknown , including IN PRP was contaminated or too degraded by environmental conditions . Or PRP MD simply mean IN DT animal PRP came from was not among DT reference samples WDT DT laboratory used for comparison . EX is no reference sample of Bigfoot DNA to compare PRP with , so by definition , EX can not be a conclusive match . Ketchum RB issued a statementrequesting IN DT U.S. NN immediately recognize Bigfoot as "" an indigenous NNS and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who MD see in their physical and cultural differences a ' license ' to hunt , trap , or kill them . "" Since no Bigfoot has ever been hunted , trapped or killed , PRP 's not clear IN DT creatures — if PRP exist — require any special federal protection . Ketchum's is not DT only genetics - based project intended to find Bigfoot . Earlier this NN , researchers from Oxford University and DT Lausanne Museum of Zoology announced PRP were collecting samples of alleged Bigfoot and Yeti hair for genetic identification . Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes collected materials from DT NN from NNP through September , and is currently conducting DNA analysis . Once DT results are in , he plans to submit his results to a peer - reviewed scientific journal . If Ketchum has DT definitive proof she claims , DT NN will soon VB about PRP , and Bigfoot will be proven once and for all . On DT other hand , if DT evidence never appears , or is inconclusive and flawed , DT search will continue .

Country music icon says just $ 1 billion out of $ 700 billion MD VB real economy back on track Country music icon Willie Nelson has a message for Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke in DT wake of DT recent $ 700 billion dollar plus Wall Street bailout – how about a bailout for DT desperate and struggling family farmers of America WDT are nearing extinction ? “ I have written a letter as NN of Farm Aid to whoever controls DT money WDT PRP MD VB to have $ 1 billion dollars from DT 700 … .$ 1 billion dollars is I VBP all PRP ’ll need to turn DT economy around if PRP start out taking care of our family farmers , ” Nelson told DT Alex Jones Show . “ PRP MD put 10 million farmers back on DT land , making a living out RB raising food and fuel …. and IN $ 1 billion dollars I VBP MD VB a long way to changing our negative attitudes WDT PRP have and DT confidence in ourselves and in our country right now , ” VBD Nelson , adding IN all foreclosures on farms should be halted immediately . “ I VBP IN if PRP invested DT $ 1 billion with our family farmers , PRP MD begin to turn PRP around , ” stressed DT country music star , later joking IN $ 100 billion MD be an even better amount . Nelson has been a multi- decade activist and vocal proponent for Farm Aid , and recently performed alongside Neil Young at DT highly successful 2008 Farm Aid concert which was held at DT Comcast Center in Mansfield , MA , having helped organize DT first Farm Aid concert in 1985 . Farm Aid is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to keep family farmers on their land and support locally sourced , humanely - raised and organic food in DT face of a gargantuan attempt on behalf of big agribusiness to squeeze DT family farmer out of existence . DT letter IN Nelson and fellow Farm Aid directors John Mellencamp , Neil Young and Dave Matthews sent to Congress points out , “ When farms thrive , Main Street businesses and local communities thrive . Far from Wall Street , family farmers are creating real wealth , producing real value , growing from seeds and sunlight a product WDT nourishes PRP both physically and economically . Supporting diverse decentralized family farming will do far more for DT stability and vitality of our country than a handful of JJ agribusiness corporations MD ever do . ” “ DT proposed $ 700 billion bailout asks taxpayers to foot DT bill without giving them DT opportunity to share in any gains . A $ 1 billion investment in family farm agriculture MD enrich PRP all , because PRP are all shareholders of DT family farm . DT return on investment in DT family farm includes thriving local economies , nutritious food for better NN , a safer and more secure food supply , a cleaner environment and more renewable NN . ” Nelson pointed out IN when 8 - 10 million family farmers were on DT land in America at DT end of DT second NN war DT economy was strong because , “ Agriculture is DT bottom rung on DT JJ ladder , ” adding IN DT farmers became a target because PRP were a political problem . “ Let ’s put out DT fire now , PRP ’ll figure out who started PRP later and DT ’s pretty much what PRP have to do , PRP have to stop DT fire and stop DT bleeding , and I VBP DT best way to do DT is still from DT ground up , VB back to our family farmer , he ’s DT NN WDT started taking care of PRP in DT beginning so let ’s let him do PRP again , ” Nelson concluded .

I VBP this because White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders VBD as much Tuesday : “ I do n’t VB anyone can argue PRP ’s probably CD of DT most successful first NNS in office . ” Since nobody can argue PRP , I ’m not VBG to try . Besides , spending five minutes Googling DT concrete factual evidence WDT MD disprove DT claim is a waste of five minutes WDT MD be spent honoring DT unrivaled greatness of our NN . Speaking of NNP ’s greatness , did PRP VB he has made PRP so nobody dies in commercial airline crashes anymore ? On Tuesday , DT NN tweeted : “ Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation . Good NN — PRP was just reported IN EX were Zero deaths in 2017 , DT best and safest NN on record ! ” DT ’s fantastic ! What ’s even more amazing is DT report NNP is citing was for JJ air travel , meaning DT JJ actions he did not take to increase commercial aviation safety in America RB helped travelers in every other country in DT NN ! And here in America , PRP went from zero commercial airline deaths in 2014 , 2015 and 2016 to an even - more - impressive zero commercial airline deaths in 2017 ! DT ’s what I call strong leadership . Speaking of which , did PRP VB our supremely confident NN has increased DT size of America ’s famously non-existent Nuclear Button , making PRP bigger than North Korea ’s Nuclear Button ? Well , he has . Late Tuesday , NNP sent DT following trouser - soiling tweet : “ North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated IN DT ‘ Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times . ’ Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him IN I too have a Nuclear Button , but PRP is a much bigger & more powerful NN than his , and my Button works ! ” WOO - HOOO ! At long last , PRP have an extremely secure and manly NN unafraid to boast about DT great size and power of our national desk - mounted nuke button , which I ’m sure is really a thing despite no credible evidence to suggest PRP exists . Of course DT NN has n’t tweeted about all his accomplishments . He ’s far too humble and fantastic , and RB too busy accomplishing more than any NN in history . But PRP can easily identify DT JJ things PRP should be thanking NNP NNP for by applying this simple two - part rule : 1 ) If PRP happened any NN after Inauguration Day 2017 and PRP was good , NNP NNP is responsible for PRP . 2 ) On DT off chance PRP ’s something not good , NNP NNP is responsible for PRP only if PRP can be framed in a way WDT makes PRP seem good . For example , DT Chicago area had its coldest NNP NNP ’s Day high temperature on record and by Saturday DT city will likely tie a decades - old record for consecutive days below 20 degrees . Donald NNP is clearly responsible for these wonderfully cold temperatures and for helping Chicago break records ! PRP never saw cold - weather records broken under NNP Barack Obama , and if Crooked Hillary NNP had been elected , PRP MD likely be 80 degrees and sunny in Chicago right now . NNP ’s conviction IN JJ NN is a hoax has forced temperatures to drop , giving Chicagoans DT enviable status of “ record breakers . ” Another important improvement over past administrations : DT total number of verified Bigfoot - related deaths in 2017 fell to zero , a comforting and substantial improvement over DT less - impressive zero Bigfoot - related deaths WDT occurred during all other American presidents ’ first NNS . So what do PRP have after only CD short NN of DT single greatest presidential administration in DT history of presidential greatness ? PRP have , inarguably , DT most successful first NN in office , with Zero deaths from plane crashes and a Nuclear Button so big PRP MD in no way be interpreted as an overcompensation for something tragically small . PRP have Chicago being made great again with record - breaking cold weather and a precipitous drop in DT number of NNS killed by Sasquatch . PRP have a booming economy , with DT S&P 500 up an unprecedented and certainly record - breaking 18 percent in NNP ’s first 11 month ’s in office , compared with DT S&P 500 VBG up a mere 36.9 percent during Obama ’s first 11 months . ( Any suggestion IN 36.9 is a larger number than 18 is FAKE NN . ) DT bottom line is this : I do n’t VB anyone can argue with how well everything is VBG in America . Have PRP noticed how every American who is alive is breathing ? I imagine PRP ’ll soon see a NNP tweet celebrating this fantastic NN : “ Since taking office I have been very strict on human beings breathing . Good NN — PRP was just reported IN all living human beings were breathing in 2017 . I am amazing and this is all thanks to me ! # MAGA . ” What to read next : NNP ’s misguided ideas about Chicago crime » NNP does n’t have some master plan . He ’s just angry and impulsive . » I VBP liars . I ’ve never seen CD IN Donald NNP . » Why “ DT Simpsons ” can read DT future »"

Hinckley and Henderson ( 1996 ) surveyed veterinarians and horse owners to estimate DT number of acute and chronic laminitis NNS in a population of approximately 113 000 horses and reported about 1700 NNS of both acute and chronic laminitis with an overall prevalence of 3 % . Approximately 61 % of DT laminitis NNS occurred in horses kept at pasture ( Hinckley & Henderson 1996 ) . DT NNP NNPS Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) survey reported IN 13 % of horse operations had had at least CD case of laminitis during DT previous 12 months with 1 % of horses affected at any CD NN ( based on owner responses ) . Laminitis was identified as DT most common cause of foot lameness , accounting for up to 16 % of all lameness NNS . Additionally , nutritionally - associated laminitis accounted for more than 50 % of DT NNS , with 46 % attributed to pasture grazing and 7 % to grain overload ( Kane et al 2000 , USDA 2000 ) . A retrospective NN in DT south of England reported DT prevalence , incidence and seasonality of laminitis in a population of about 1000 horses / ponies kept on a single farm and maintained at pasture ( Menzies - Gow et al 2010a ) . Over a 6 - NN period , 23.5 % of DT population had at least CD episode of veterinary diagnosed laminitis ; DT highest prevalence ( 2.6 % ) and incidence ( 16 NNS / 1000 animals ) of laminitis occurred in NNP . A positive association was found between hours of sunshine and DT prevalence and incidence of laminitis , but EX were no associations with rainfall or monthly temperature . DT association between hours of sunshine and incident laminitis was presumed to reflect altered nutritional intake ( i.e. , increased consumption of nonstructural carbohydrates during periods of bright sunshine WDT promote plant photosynthesis and carbohydrate accumulation ) rather than DT direct effect of exposure of horses to sunlight . Other studies have reported an increased risk of laminitis during DT spring and summer months ( Dorn et al 1975 , Hinckley & Henderson 1996 , USDA 2000 ) although evidence of seasonality is inconsistent ( Polzer & Slater 1997 , Wyllie et al 2011 b ) . Menzies - Gow et al ( 2010a ) RB observed IN approximately CD - third of animals diagnosed with laminitis had at least CD more episode during DT NN period . Moreover , about 24 % of these animals had a repeated episode in DT same NN as DT original diagnosis . These observations confirm DT clinical impression IN some animals are prone to repeated episodes of laminitis ( Buckley et al 2007 ) and focus attention on DT possibility IN EX are phenotypic or genetic factors associated with susceptibility . With regards to genetic factors , laminitis in a foal attributable to disruption of a single molecule of DT hemidesmosome adhesion complex was believed to be DT result of an inherited recessive defect WDT lead to failure in expression of DT protein plectin ( French & Pollitt 2004 ) . Additionally , Belgian foals with mechanobullous NN ( epidermolysis bullosa ) are at an increased risk of laminitis ( Frame et al 1988 ) . In DT NN by Menzies - Gow et al ( 2010a ) , univariate analysis revealed IN animals ≥ 14.3 hands in height were at reduced risk of laminitis while females , light animals ( < 400 kg ) and animals with a weight - to - height ratio < 7.51 kg / in were at higher risk . Female gender RB was a significant risk factor in multivariate analysis , a finding in agreement with several other studies ( Dorn et al 1975 , Alford et al 2001 , Slater et al 1995 ) . DT reason for DT apparent increased laminitis risk in mares is not known . DT height and weight associations with laminitis lend support to DT clinical impression IN ponies are at higher risk as compared to horses , although in multivariate analysis weight but not height was revealed as a significant risk factor ( Menzies - Gow et al 2010a ) . In a prospective NN of pasture - associated laminitis , DT majority of affected animals ( 89 of 107 NNS ) were overweight / obese ( Menzies - Gow et al 2010 b ) . Additionally , overweight animals were at increased risk of severe clinical signs and were less likely to survive . These findings are consistent with earlier reports WDT identified obesity as a risk factor for laminitis ( Alford et al 2001 ) . Increased load bearing by DT feet is CD potential explanation for DT increased risk of laminitis in overweight / obese animals . Several studies have characterized metabolic risk factors for pasture - associated laminitis in ponies ( Treiber et al 2005 , 2006 , Bailey et al 2007 , 2008 , Carter et al 2009 ) . In an inbred herd of Welsh and Dartmoor ponies , laminitis risk was associated with DT clustering of hyperinsulinemia , obesity and hypertriglyceridemia – this phenotype was termed “ prelaminitic metabolic syndrome ( PLMS ) ” ( Treiber et al 2006 ) . DT PLMS criteria predicted 11 of 13 NNS of clinical laminitis observed in NNP of DT same NN , with an odds ratio of 10.4 ( i.e. ponies with this phenotype were at approximately 10 - times higher risk for laminitis ) . Pedigree analysis suggested a dominant mode of inheritance of DT PLMS phenotype , supporting DT possibility of a genetic basis for laminitis predisposition ( Treiber et al 2006 ) . A subsequent NN of this pony population demonstrated IN DT presence of obesity ( generalized or regional , i.e. , cresty neck ) , hyperinsulinemia ( insulin > 32 mU / l when sampled on winter pasture ) or hyperleptinemia ( > 7.3 ng / ml ) were useful predictors of laminitis episodes when ponies were exposed to high carbohydrate pasture ( Carter et al 2009 ) . A NN of out - bred ponies in DT UK RB revealed an association between apparent insulin resistance ( IR ) and predisposition to pasture laminitis , and provided evidence of hypertension in DT high risk ponies ( Bailey et al 2008 ) . Interestingly , expression of this metabolic phenotype was only noted in summer but not winter , suggesting interaction with environmental factors such as consumption of summer pasture forage ( Bailey et al 2008 ) . As mentioned , EMS rather than PLMS has been broadly adopted to describe horses and ponies with an insulin resistant phenotype and associated predisposition to laminitis . These animals are often overweight or obese ( or have localized large fat deposits , e.g. , a “ cresty neck ” ) and exhibit abnormal insulin dynamics , either resting hyperinsulinemia or an exaggerated increase in insulin concentration in response to oral or intravenous glucose challenges ( Frank et al 2010 , Frank 2011 ) . In addition to pony breeds , Morgan Horses , domesticated Spanish mustangs , European warmbloods and American saddlebreds are thought to be at increased risk for development of EMS ; however , currently EX is insufficient evidence to support or refute this belief . PRP should be emphasized IN non -obese animals WDT MD or MD not show IR RB can experience recurrent laminitis ."

By DT 1960s , tuberculosis ( TB ) had been almost totally eradicated in DT NNP NNPS . But 50 NNS later , according to a March 20 Reuters article , “ Half a million NNS fell sick with dangerous superbug strains of TB in 2012 , but fewer than CD in four were diagnosed . ” DT NNP NNP Organization has called drug- resistant tuberculosis ( DRTB ) a “ JJ NN crisis , ” predicting IN worldwide two million NNS MD be infected by next NN . If TB was on DT outs , why is PRP coming back now in more virulent strains ? DT culprit ? A massive unregulated flow of lawbreakers crossing our southern border from Mexico and Latin America has led to a resurgence of fatal airborne diseases IN TB WDT attack DT lungs . Cities in DT U.S. such as Los Angeles and Jacksonville , Florida have seen dramatic rises in TB . DT situation has become so dire IN in DT City of Angels , police officers are now advised to wear surgical masks when dealing with illegal aliens . On March 20 , this reporter contacted Salina Smith , a spokesperson for DT Atlanta - based Centers for NNP Control and Prevention , to inquire as to why TB is again plaguing our shores . “ Despite declines among other demographics , DRTB has taken a heavy toll in DT U.S. along racial and ethnic lines , not to mention DT homeless and those infected with HIV , ” VBD Ms. Smith . “ Geographically , four NNS account for more than half of all TB NNS : California , Texas , NNP York and Florida . ” Continuing with specifics , Ms. Smith stated : “ Hispanics and blacks have rates seven - times higher than whites , whereas Asians now exhibit TB rates 26 - times higher than whites . Overall , foreign - born residents are 13 - times more likely to have TB than are U.S. - born citizens . ” Considering IN working - class taxpayers will be forced to foot DT bill for illegals and foreign - born patients , Ms. Smith was asked about DT costs for medicating patients with TB . “ Treating typical TB comes in at $ 17,000 , while costs associated with DRTB rise to $ 134,000 , ” she VBD . “ In NNS of extreme DRTB , PRP ’re looking at $ 430,000 in hospital fees . ” On March 20 , this reporter RB interviewed legendary author , activist and founder of DT conservative - oriented Eagle Forum , Phyllis Schlafly . Having herself written on this subject , Mrs. Schlafly told this newspaper : “ PRP ’s outrageous what ’s happening at our southern border . Why is n’t this administration keeping diseased NNS out ? PRP used to be DT rule at Ellis Island IN if someone was n’t healthy , PRP were sent back home . ” When questioned about this administration ’s open - border policy , Mrs. Schlafly replied : “ Obama does n’t pay attention to DT law . DT American NNS overwhelmingly VBP our borders secured , but I genuinely VBP Obama wants to destroy this nation . ” Mrs. Schlafly added : “ Just imagine how JJ innocent NNS on DT streets and in hospitals are being infected by illegal immigrants . Letting illegals into this country is CD of Obama ’s highest priorities . PRP ’s shocking . ” Lastly , on March 20 , this reporter RB reached out to Sandra Murillo , press officer for Doctors Without Borders . Voicing an undeniable urgency , Ms. Murillo explained : “ PRP ’re calling for immediate action to stop DRTB . This means doctors , pharmaceutical companies and researchers . ” Unfortunately , DT Obama administration ’s refusal to enforce immigration laws while advocating amnesty for upwards of 20 million illegal aliens — JJ afflicted with bacterial infections — will only cause TB rates among these populations to skyrocket .

To accomplish this , implosions are designed to achieve high peak implosion velocity , good NN coupling between DT hotspot and imploding shell , and high areal - density at stagnation . However , experiments have shown IN achieving these simultaneously is extremely challenging , partly because of inherent tradeoffs between these three interrelated requirements . DT Bigfoot approach is to intentionally trade off high convergence , and therefore areal - density , in favor of high implosion velocity and good coupling between DT hotspot and shell . This is done by intentionally colliding DT shocks in DT DT NN layer . This results in a short laser pulse which improves hohlraum symmetry and predictability while DT reduced compression improves hydrodynamic stability . DT results of this campaign will be reviewed and include demonstrated low - mode symmetry control at two different hohlraum geometries ( 5.75 mm and 5.4 mm diameters ) and at two different target scales ( 5.4 mm and 6.0 mm hohlraum diameters ) spanning 300 - 430 TW in laser power and 0.8 - 1.7 MJ in laser NN . Results of DT 10 % scaling between these designs for DT hohlraum and capsule will be presented .

Write a simple statement WDT gives DT number of measurement units followed by DT units of measure used . Do not use full sentences . If DT extent is an estimation , DT statement can be preceded by language to indicate IN DT measurement is estimated . If a number is longer than three digits , use commas . For example , a number should be written out as 12,877 instead of 12877 . Two - dimensional Materials For two - dimensional materials ( paper , photographs , maps , etc. ) express DT extent either as a linear measure or as a page or item count . ( A linear measurement expresses length ; a cubic measurement expresses volume , which is length times width times height . ) Linear Measure When indicating a linear measure , use DT terms "" linear feet "" and "" linear inches . "" • If a foot or more , enter DT feet and inches to DT nearest inch . • If less than CD foot , enter DT linear inches to DT nearest inch . • If less than CD inch , enter decimal fractions of an inch to DT nearest . 1 inch , but not less than .1 inch . • If less than .1 inch , enter DT term "" Negligible "" or indicate DT item or page count . How to Measure Determine DT linear measurement as follows . • In general Measure DT material in DT direction a user MD look through PRP - perpendicular to DT face of DT document . • Boxed records If DT records are in a box , measure them by DT way PRP run in DT box . For example : If DT records are tri-folded and standing up , DT measurement MD be up to 12 inches in a letter size box . If DT records are unfolded and filed vertically , DT measurement MD be up to 5 inches in a letter or legal size box . If DT records completely fill their containers , PRP is possible to use DT container measurements as a convenience to calculate extent for large series . When multiplying container width to determine linear measure , use DT width of DT box as stated in DT Holdings Measurement Type Authority List . For example , for LTA-S and LGA - S boxes , multiply DT number of boxes by 5 1/4 inches . If multiplying by DT length of DT box ( for example , for tri-folded paper filed from front to back ) , use DT length as stated in DT Holdings Measurement Type Authority List . • Cards If measuring cards , measure them by DT way DT cards run in DT box . • Bound records If DT records are bound volumes , measure DT widths of DT spines . • Rolled maps , plans , etc . If DT records are rolled maps , plans , blueprints , or posters , flatten DT material and measure DT thickness . ( An estimate will suffice if DT materials are too fragile to be rolled out and flattened . ) Page or Item Count When indicating a page count , use DT term "" pages . "" If necessary , DT page count MD be estimated . If DT archival materials are comprised of various NN types , distinguish each type to make DT extent measurement as accurate as possible . Three - dimensional Materials For three - dimensional materials , indicate DT number of items and DT NN type ( reels , rolls , cassettes , artifacts , etc. ) . DT length of film on rolls or reels is entered in Footage or Total Footage . If needed to clarify DT amount of archival material , indicate both DT intellectual count and DT physical count . Data Files For electronic records , indicate DT number of data files or type of logical data records . A logical data record is a set of data processed as a unit by a computer system or application independently of its physical environment . Examples of a logical data record include a word processing document , an e-mail message , each row in each table of a relational database , each row in an independent logical file database . Accuracy and Precision Be as accurate and precise as possible . Do not say "" 1,000 photographs , 1 linear foot , "" which implies EX are photographs and some other materials , when DT actual amount is "" 1 linear foot comprised of 1,000 photographs . "" Say "" 2,000 maps "" instead of "" 2,000 items . "" DT extent MD be estimated if necessary ."

Because molluscum contagiosum is self - limited in healthy individuals , treatment MD be unnecessary . Nonetheless , issues such as lesion visibility , underlying atopic NN , and DT desire to prevent transmission MD prompt therapy . Treatment for molluscum is usually recommended if lesions are in DT genital area ( on or near DT penis , vulva , vagina , or anus ) . If lesions are found in this area PRP is a good idea to visit your healthcare provider as EX is a possibility IN PRP MD have another NN spread by sexual contact . Be aware IN some treatments available through DT internet MD not be effective and MD even be harmful . Physical removal of lesions MD include cryotherapy ( freezing DT lesion with liquid nitrogen ) , curettage ( DT piercing of DT core and scraping of caseous or cheesy material ) , and laser therapy . These options are rapid and require a trained NN care provider , MD require local anesthesia , and can result in post - procedural pain , irritation , and scarring . PRP is not a good idea to try and remove lesions or DT fluid inside of lesions yourself . By removing lesions or lesion fluid by yourself PRP MD unintentionally autoinoculate other parts of DT body or risk spreading PRP to others . By scratching or scraping DT skin PRP MD cause a bacterial infection . Gradual removal of lesions MD be achieved by oral therapy . This technique is often desirable for pediatric patients because PRP is generally less painful and MD be performed by parents at home in a less threatening environment . Oral cimetidine has been used as an alternative treatment for small NNS who are either afraid of DT pain associated with cryotherapy , curettage , and laser therapy or because DT possibility of scarring is to be avoided . While cimetidine is safe , painless , and well tolerated , facial mollusca do not respond as well as lesions elsewhere on DT body . Podophyllotoxin cream ( 0.5 % ) is reliable as a home therapy for men but is not recommended for pregnant women because of presumed toxicity to DT fetus . Each lesion must be treated individually as DT therapeutic effect is localized . Other options for topical therapy include iodine and salicylic acid , potassium hydroxide , tretinoin , cantharidin ( a blistering agent usually applied in an office setting ) , and imiquimod ( T cell modifier ) . Imiquimod has not been proven effective for DT treatment of molluscum contagiosum in NNS and is not recommended for NNS due to possible adverse events . These treatments must be prescribed by a NN care professional . Most therapies are effective in immunocompetent patients ; however , patients with HIV / AIDS or other immunosuppressing conditions often do not respond to traditional treatments . In addition , these treatments are largely ineffective in achieving long - term control in HIV patients . Low CD4 cell counts have been linked to widespread facial mollusca and therefore have become a marker for severe HIV NN . Thus far , therapies targeted at boosting DT immune system have proven DT most effective therapy for molluscum contagiosum in immunocompromised persons . In extreme NNS , intralesional interferon has been used to treat facial lesions in these patients . However , DT severe and unpleasant side effects of interferon , such as influenza - IN symptoms , site tenderness , depression , and lethargy , make PRP a less - than - desirable treatment . Furthermore , interferon therapy proved most effective in otherwise healthy persons . Radiation therapy is RB of little benefit ."

DT narrative of how Osama bin Laden and what was to become al - Qaeda were initially supported by DT U.S. , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to drive DT Red Army out of Afghanistan is well known . Washington did so with little regard for broader agendas , including removing DT NNP NNPS out of DT Middle East and regime changing DT existing secular and religious Arab NNS in DT region . When DT American supported Holy Warrior Mujahidin were successful beyond their dreams and succeeded in forcing DT Soviets to withdraw during 1998 - 9 , a weak Moscow - supported Mohammad Najibullah regime stayed in power , only to be defeated in 1992 by DT Taliban , who were CD component of DT Islamist groups WDT were being supported by DT U.S. and its partners . DT Taliban soon demonstrated IN PRP too were not willing to be tools of either Islamabad or Washington and eventually provided al - Qaeda and bin Laden with a home , DT casus belli WDT led to DT U.S. attack on Afghanistan after 9/11 . DT U.S. occupation of Iraq followed , based on a similar pretext , i.e. IN Saddam Hussein was in league with terrorists and was preparing weapons of mass destruction WDT threatened DT NNP NNPS . DT deliberate dismantling of Iraqi NN mechanisms coupled with a collapse in its civil society resulting in extreme sectarianism led JJ Sunni Iraqis to join DT next emerging terrorist group , DT Islamic NNP ( IS ) , RB called DT Islamic NNP in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) or Daesh . IS was as surely DT product of DT American interventionist tactics in Iraq as were al - Qaeda and DT Taliban earlier in Afghanistan . IS ’s appeal was largely due to its recreation of a territorial NN , which PRP dubbed DT JJ Caliphate . PRP is now facing final defeat at its last remaining enclaves in Iraq and Syria . Soon , PRP will only be a dark memory in those two NNS , a legacy of ruined cities , mass executions , cultural vandalism and torture . PRP is not known if DT Islamic NNP ’s leader Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi is still alive , but DT group , which proved to be particularly astute in its handling of internet generated propaganda , will certainly live on through radical websites and to an extent through its foreign supporters returning to their home NNS to carry out terrorist acts . EX were RB be places in Africa and Asia where IS will continue to have a physical presence on DT ground , to include Sinai and Libya . But , generally speaking , DT group will cease to exist , even though PRP can anticipate IN EX will be successor organizations WDT will benefit from DT IS example and follow a similar pattern to attract recruits . What has changed , however , is DT manner in which IS was defeated . DT NNP NNPS helped create al - Qaeda and DT Taliban and then played a major role in attempting to destroy them after PRP ceased to be useful . Washington did indeed play a part in DT fighting against IS but PRP was generally in support of others IN DT Iraqi Army or Kurdish militias and PRP did not VB seriously engaged due to misgivings about previous interventions and incompatible demands for regime NN in Damascus . So IS was defeated by a coalition of Muslim NNS supported by limited but effective Russian air and NN power , not by some arrangement cobbled together by DT NNP NNPS . Now , DT NNP NNPS , which has lost what little leverage PRP had to participate at DT head table in any discussions to come to a final settlement of DT Syrian crisis is desperately seeking to remain relevant by leaving its troops in DT area and operating through surrogates . But DT big loser in DT defeat of IS will likely be Israel . DT Netanyahu NN , whose overall strategy has been to weaken all of its neighbors by bringing about their fragmentation along sectarian and tribal lines , has assisted both IS and al - Qaeda fighters in Syria against DT country ’s legitimate NN and has repeatedly attacked Syrian Army forces . PRP has been actively supporting Kurdish separatism in Iraq while urging DT NNP NNPS to attack Iran and is now colluding with Saudi Arabia to use both military and JJ force to compel DT Lebanese NN to remove DT political arm of Hezbollah from DT country ’s NN and to disarm DT group . This has created a crescent of battle - tested governments running from DT Caspian NNP to DT Mediterranean – Libya , Syria , Iraq and Iran - which now have particularly good reasons to hate DT Israelis and their meddling in DT region . PRP MD be overreach to suggest IN DT four governments in question will act in unison against Israel because each has particular national interests WDT will drive its policies , but PRP certainly will not make any effort to be accommodating to either Israel or to DT NNP NNPS . DT four nations are VBN by DT experience of their war against IS , by their largely Shi’a populations , and by their appreciation of DT Iranian effort WDT contributed so greatly to their successes on DT battlefield . Once again , DT NNP NNPS has intervened in a conflict in DT Middle East WDT was none of its business and , regarding which , no genuine interests were involved . And behind DT scenes , Israel was encouraging DT unrest for its own reasons . Washington can again walk away from DT mess WDT PRP has created , but will PRP ? Recent comments from Secretary of Defense James Mattis and from Nikki Haley at DT U.N. WDT DT U.S. will keep troops in Syria and will "" fight for justice "" MD suggest IN DT adults have again left DT room . But someday DT NNP NNPS will either have a reality check or run out of manpower and money and will VB . Israel will have to stick around and is likely to find itself in a really unfriendly neighborhood ."

CD of their original plans is to establish an AI - based population control system dubbed as Technocratic Dictatorship where everyone is hooked up to DT control grid through digitized currency and mass surveillance system , until NNP ’s Huawei came along and arrested their 5G development . Now , PRP are not saying IN EX ’s no possibility IN all of these are just part of an elaborate drama , and NNP is just coasting along with DT imperialists , for whatever power sharing structure PRP MD benefit them . But even then , PRP do n’t really VB IN EX ’s still something WDT DT West MD offer to NNP at this point in NN . In fact , PRP believe IN DT actions of DT NNP and UK governments , e.g. DT sanctions and trade wars against DT Alliance , MD all be part of DT delaying tactics WDT should give DT Deep NN enough NN for last minute preparations . PRP thought IN PRP MD be NNP Zealand , but its premature exposure contributed to multiple protests coming from DT Maori tribe , among high profile personalities . So , in DT event when DT NNS of DT West begin to rise up with their torches and pitchforks against DT exceptionalist Nazionists , e.g. a widespread Yellow Vests protests scenario , a rich patch of land in a country WDT once hosted DT highest ranking officers of DT Nazi Germany is already being prepared for Ratline 2.0 ! No , PRP ’re not VBG to Antarctica . Do PRP really believe IN billionaires suffering from rheumatoid arthritis MD love to retire RB ? DT Dark Secret Behind a British Billionaire ’s “ Parallel NNP ” In Argentina ’s Patagonia A sinister plan involving DT NN ’s most notorious oligarchs , as well as DT IMF and key elements of DT JJ Zionist lobby , lurks beneath DT de facto independent NN created by CD of England ’s richest men in DT heart of Argentina ’s Patagonia . EL BOLSÓN , ARGENTINA – At DT “ end of DT NN , ” spanning DT southernmost regions of Argentina and Chile , lies DT land of Patagonia , much of which remains a pristine wilderness WDT has inspired countless naturalists and MD - be adventurers with its dramatic landscapes and natural beauty . For JJ , PRP is a place WDT still feels remarkably untouched and removed from DT chaos of DT modern NN . Yet , PRP is these very qualities , as well as DT region ’s great oil and gas potential and its abundance of glacier - fed freshwater reserves , WDT have placed PRP in DT crosshairs of predators — predators armed with billions of dollars , powerful influence over Argentine politics and DT country ’s press , as well as alliances with controversial international financial organizations and key elements of DT JJ Zionist lobby . Coveted for its still largely unplundered resources , Patagonia has become DT target of a close - knit network of notorious billionaires and JJ elites , who have spent much of DT last two and a half decades seeking to transform this area into their own independent NN . Indeed , though several of these billionaires have already created de facto private NNS where PRP enjoy near - total impunity within Argentine Patagonia , others have been behind major efforts WDT have pushed for DT territory ’s secession . Still others have pushed Argentina ’s NN to exchange its claim to Patagonia for “ debt relief ” as a way of easing Argentina ’s JJ plight WDT , incidentally , was largely created by this very same group of billionaires . DT International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , whose connections to this billionaire network are considerable , has had an outsized role in this effort . Yet this appears to be more than just a venture on DT behalf of notable oligarchs and DT JJ elite , as prominent elements of DT international Zionist lobby are intimately involved , as is DT NN of Israel , though DT extent of DT involvement of DT latter is subject to debate . Their interest revolves around claims WDT date back to DT founding of Zionism in DT 19th century , when revered Zionist figures IN Theodore Herzl discussed Argentina as a potential homeland for a Jewish ethno - NN . Since then , other notable Zionists , including past Israeli ambassadors to Argentina , have argued IN Israel is for “ European Jews ” while “ American Jews ” must take Argentina for themselves . Notably , DT method suggested by Herzl as a means of creating a Zionist NN in his seminal work “ DT Jewish NNP ” involves DT exchange of debt for territory . In DT first part of this investigative series , MintPress explores DT de facto independent NN WDT has been created by British billionaire and Zionist Joe Lewis , a long - NN associate of controversial Hungarian - American financier George Soros . Lewis has essentially bought out DT local , regional and even national NN of Argentina , allowing him to operate with impunity while he acquires more and more territory through land purchases of dubious ( if any ) legality , intimidates and threatens locals , usurps crucial NN and NN resources from local towns , and operates his own international private airport WDT no NN but he controls . Subsequent reports in this series will examine DT other key players in this effort to create a Patagonian NN , namely Argentine oligarchs Marcelo Mindlin and Eduardo Elsztain , who are both deeply connected to DT JJ Zionist lobby and DT Rockefeller - founded Americas Society , and are RB both close Soros associates . Finally , DT role of these individuals and their associates in efforts to use IMF debt slavery to pressure DT Argentine NN to swap debt for territory will be revealed , as will DT role of DT Zionist lobby and prominent figures in DT JJ elite . DT quaint mountain town of El Bolsón , nestled among DT picturesque rocky peaks of Argentina ’s Patagonia and famed for its local legends of gnomes and elves , MD seem an unlikely epicenter in a nationwide battle WDT has pitted locals against powerful foreign billionaires — billionaires who are not only plundering DT country ’s rich resources but eroding its national sovereignty through backdoor deals with Argentina ’s most powerful , and most corrupt , political leaders . Yet , however unlikely DT role of this sleepy town in Argentina ’s Río Negro province MD seem , for over a decade JJ locals have used every tool at their disposal to oppose CD billionaire ’s effort to turn DT town and much of Río Negro into his own personal fiefdom . This struggle has seen massive demonstrations in El Bolsón against British billionaire Joe Lewis , with some attracting as JJ as 15,000 participants – nearly 80 percent of DT town ’s entire population . Lewis , worth an estimated $ 5.2 billion according Forbes , is best known in DT West for owning DT British Tottenham Hotspur football club , his sprawling luxury estates and golf resorts in DT Bahamas and Florida , and owning well - known brands including Puma sportswear and Vans shoes . He is often described as a “ self - made ” billionaire , having been born to a poor Jewish family in London , who worked his way up to become CD of England ’s richest men . Since DT mid-1990s , Lewis has been building an empire in Patagonia , having become DT owner of extensive properties north of El Bolsón — which , among other things , contain almost all of DT town ’s NN reserves , as well as those of DT nearby farming community , Mallín Ahogado — and DT de facto power behind Pampa Energía , DT company controlling most of Argentina ’s electricity production . Part Two of this series will focus on Lewis ’ role at Pampa Energía , as well as DT of his associate , Marcelo Mindlin . Long before his venture into Argentina , Lewis was a controversial figure owing to his close association with controversial Hungarian - American financier George Soros . Indeed , DT bulk of Lewis ’ massive fortune derives from his decision to “ team up ” with Soros to bet against DT British pound in 1992 , a day popularly known as Black Wednesday . Soros ’ and Lewis ’ bet against DT pound actually led to DT pound crashing , after Soros ordered his hedge fund to “ VB for DT jugular ” and aggressively trade against DT currency , thereby prompting its sharp devaluation . Though Soros is often called “ DT man who broke DT Bank of England ” as a result of DT $ 1 billion in profits he made on DT fateful day , Lewis is VBN to have made an even larger profit than Soros , according to several reports . While Soros became a financial celebrity after Black Wednesday , Lewis opted to stay out of DT limelight even though , just three NNS later , he MD repeat what he helped do to DT British pound with DT Mexican peso , reaping yet another massive profit . While DT Mexican peso crisis made Lewis even wealthier , PRP led to a massive jump in poverty , unemployment and inequality in Mexico and left its NN beholden to DT International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) through a loan package arranged by then - U.S. NNP Bill NNP . Between 1995 and 1996 , DT severe JJ recession WDT followed DT Mexican peso crisis spread throughout DT Americas and “ severely affected ” DT economies of other Latin American NNS IN Argentina . As fresh JJ havoc arrived and took hold in Argentina , Lewis decided to take advantage of DT troubled regional JJ NN WDT he himself had helped create and began developing his interests in Patagonia . As will be explored later in this investigative series , Soros and two of his Argentine associates who are RB connected to Lewis — Eduardo Elsztain and Marcelo Mindlin — took advantage of this JJ crisis and subsequent crises to buy major stakes in several banks as well as massive tracts of Argentine real estate , particularly in Patagonia . How to build an empire In 1996 , Joe Lewis returned to Argentina after initially visiting DT country in 1992 at DT invitation of Australian NN tycoon Kerry Packer . Lewis , apparently inspired by his first visit , had decided to buy property in DT area . According to regional NN outlet El Patagónico , Lewis ’ dream was not just owning his piece of paradise , but creating “ his own NN in Patagonia . ” Lewis soon came into contact with Nicolás Van Ditmar , who MD not only facilitate Lewis ’ initial and subsequent land purchases in Argentina ’s Patagonia but MD RB do so for several other foreign oligarchs . Van Ditmar had previously arranged massive land sales farther south to DT Benetton Group , DT family company run by DT Italian oligarchs of DT same name , best known as DT owners of DT NNP Colors of Benetton clothing company . Van Ditmar , after learning of what Lewis hoped to acquire , spoke to him of DT property of DT Montero family , which encircled a pristine mountain lake known as Lago Escondido ( Hidden Lake ) . Most of DT members of DT Montero family agreed to sell their collective property of around 14,000 hectares ( ~34,549 acres ) to Lewis for $ 7 million . However , CD of DT Montero brothers , Irineo Montero , had refused and he , along with his wife María Ortiz and their employee José Matamala , were all found dead under mysterious circumstances . Whether or not Lewis or his “ right hand man ” Van Ditmar were somehow involved in Irineo ’s death and those of his wife and employee , EX is no denying IN their mysterious yet grisly endings cleared DT way for Lewis ’ purchase of Lago Escondido and DT surrounding area . However , Lewis ’ acquisition of this property , irrespective of DT remaining Montero siblings ’ willingness to sell , should never have been allowed for several reasons . First , as per Argentine law , DT sale of DT property WDT Lewis has owned since 1996 is prohibited to a foreign citizen on national security grounds , given IN DT property is just 20 km from DT Chilean border and thus , in foreign hands , MD represent a grave national security risk . Second , PRP violates a local law dating back to 1969 WDT caps DT maximum amount of land WDT any individual – Argentine citizen or foreigner – MD own at around 70 hectares ( ~172 acres ) . Third , PRP violates a provincial law passed in 1994 WDT created a protected natural area called DT Río Azul Lago Escondido Natural Protected Area ( ANPRALE ) , which included a significant portion of DT land WDT Lewis MD later buy from DT Monteros . However , DT law was amended in 1998 , a few NNS after Lewis ’ purchase , to remove DT portion of his land WDT had previously been named a protected area under DT control of DT NN . Federico Soria noted IN DT way in which DT 1994 law was amended was blatantly unconstitutional . PRP MD VB IN DT law MD have prevented Lewis ’ acquisition of DT land long before Van Ditmar had first approached DT Monteros about Lewis ’ interest in DT land . However , he was explicitly allowed to do so , despite DT illegal nature of DT purchase , owing to DT general laxity of DT local , regional and federal authorities towards wealthy foreigners looking to acquire Argentine land . As Lewis himself VBD in an interview with Gonzalo Sanchez in 2004 , “ I bought what PRP let me buy and here PRP are . ” DT two - term presidency of Carlos Menem in DT 1990s marked DT reversal of more than 50 NNS of keeping and protecting areas of national importance and deemed strategic to natural security by permitting foreigners to buy a larger percentage of land than had been allowed since DT passage of a 1944 law intended to preserve DT territorial integrity of Argentina . Notably , when DT law was created , DT NN of Edelmiro Farrell and Juan Perón expropriated several strategic properties owned by foreigners . Yet , Menem ’s presidency — which was thoroughly aligned with DT “ Washington consensus ” — began , according to critics , violating DT spirit of this 1944 law by issuing approvals of several million hectares to foreigners . Menem ’s policies favoring foreign land purchases in rural areas have since been expanded by DT presidency of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner as well as DT of DT current NN of Argentina , Mauricio Macri . Both of them have used Lewis ’ private helicopter and Macri is a regular visitor of Lewis ’ lakeside property in Patagonia . Locals in El Bolsón have claimed IN Lewis ’ purchase of DT Lago Escondido property – despite DT legal obstacles – was DT direct result of Menem ’s policies . A member of El Bolsón ’s community radio station FM Alas , who chose to remain anonymous owing to his father ’s personal involvement in Lewis ’ regional businesses , told MintPress IN Lewis “ had negotiated DT purchase of DT [ Lago Escondido ] property in meetings at DT Casa Rosada [ Pink House ] , ” DT Argentine equivalent of DT White House , during Menem ’s presidency . MintPress was unable to confirm whether Lewis or his associates had visited DT Casa Rosada while negotiating DT property ’s purchase . Yet Lewis has stated in interviews IN “ Menem sent PRP greetings and his best wishes when PRP opened [ Lewis ’ Lago Escondido mansion ] ” ( Sanchez interview , pg. 61 ) . Furthermore , Lewis has a notable habit of building close relationships with powerful Argentine politicians , including Macri . Macri has called Lewis “ a friend , ” defended him repeatedly , and even personally vacationed at Lewis ’ Lago Escondido property . Ever since his arrival to DT area caused concern among some locals , Lewis has sought to win DT good graces of DT NNS of El Bolsón by acting as their benefactor — donating hospitals , building soccer fields and hosting annual activities and sporting competitions for locals at his property . This altruism is either embraced or rejected by locals , depending on whom PRP talk to . In keeping with DT image WDT he has sought to cultivate among DT townspeople , Lewis is often referred to as “ Uncle Joe , ” though PRP is spoken with either respect and admiration or derision and disgust . Felicitas Libano , a member of DT Assembly for DT Defense of NNP and Land ( ADAT ) , told MintPress IN Lewis has “ integrated himself into nearly all DT function of DT city , ” including its firefighters , police and other areas of DT municipal NN , and has “ always tried to position himself as a benefactor . ” According to Guido Augello , a member of local community radio station FM Alas , DT townspeople are divided somewhat evenly into “ NNS WDT VBP ‘ Uncle Joe , ’ NNS who hate him and NNS who do n’t care . ” Lewis has RB won over a portion of DT townspeople and local businessmen through his patronage of select local services and his occasional hosting of small groups of locals for invitation - only sporting events and holiday celebrations . However , some have contended IN Lewis receives JJ foreign guests , particularly from Israel . According to DT research of former French intelligence officer turned journalist Thierry Meyssan , Lewis has been inviting thousands of Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) soldiers to his territory annually . In late 2017 , Meyssan alleged : Since DT Falklands War , DT Israeli army has been organizing ‘ holiday camps ’ in Patagonia for its soldiers . Between 8,000 and 10,000 of them now come every NN to spend two weeks on Joe Lewis ’ land . ” PRP is unclear if Meyssan ’s information was DT result of his NN in France ’s exterior intelligence service DGSE or independent research he conducted since becoming a journalist , as MintPress ’ efforts to contact Meyssan were unsuccessful . Locals , journalists and researchers interviewed by MintPress MD not confirm Meyssan ’s claims . Yet , JJ of these locals and researchers VBD PRP had heard of those claims from other sources within Argentina , but RB noted IN PRP were speculative , given IN no NN but Lewis or his employees knows who visits DT property beyond DT aforementioned events where select locals are invited to attend . Beyond DT alleged IDF “ vacations ” on Lewis ’ land , his presence in DT area has been controversial for other reasons , namely for concerns IN he sought to usurp key regional resources . Indeed , journalist Gonzalo Sanchez noted in his 2004 book Patagonia Sold : DT NNP Owners of DT Land : In El Bolsón , EX are more than a few locals and city council members WDT believe IN , behind his [ Lewis ’ ] generosity , EX are other hidden objectives , IN DT possible control of DT NN reserves of this part of Patagonia ( pg. 50 ) . ” Inklings of DT truth in relation to these concerns were evident as soon as Lewis acquired DT property surrounding Lago Escondido . This large mountain lake , which Lewis ’ property surrounds , is DT NN basin for two important regional rivers , DT Manso and Puelo , which later unite in Chile and drain into DT Pacific . PRP is RB DT lake DT feeds other nearby lakes including DT Soberanía Lakes and Montes Lake , among others . Lago Escondido itself is estimated to contain as JJ as 400 billion liters ( ~105 billion gallons ) of freshwater . In Argentina , as is RB DT case in neighboring Chile , NN – whether in lakes , rivers or seas – is a JJ right and JJ access to all bodies of NN is guaranteed by law . This legal concept — likely foreign to Lewis and other Westerners , whose home NNS often enshrine private property rights over DT NN ’s right to vital resources — has been DT most visible way in which tensions between Lewis and locals have manifested . PRP was RB DT first real test of Lewis ’ resolve to carve out his “ independent NN ” in Patagonia and keep locals out . Lewis closed off DT JJ road from DT highway to DT lake and RB closed DT private road he built at a separate point from JJ access . According to several locals interviewed by MintPress who had tried to enter DT area , private security in civilian clothing prevent NNS from using DT roads either by vehicle or on foot . Federico Soria , who has himself tried to enter DT area on several occasions , described DT guards to MintPress as “ intimidating ” and “ aggressive ” and RB VBD IN DT Montero family , DT old owners of DT land , block CD of DT roads before PRP enters Lewis ’ property and are “ heavily armed . ” DT only remaining path is a steep – and in places , dangerous – mountain path WDT takes at least two days in each direction to traverse . DT path is poorly marked and maintained and is only usable in summer , as PRP is blocked by snowfall in other seasons . Every person interviewed by MintPress who had seen or traversed DT path described PRP as being suitable only for “ experienced mountaineers . ” In 2009 , Lewis suffered his first major defeat in his efforts to keep locals out of his “ parallel NN ” when DT regional court ruled IN DT Tacuifi road — which connects DT lake to DT main highway , Route 40 , and crosses Lewis ’ property — be opened . DT ruling stated IN this must be done in order to “ ensure access to Lago Escondido with appropriate signaling and ensuring transability . ” DT court gave Lewis 120 days to comply . However , he did n’t comply and instead his regional associates began openly threatening any who tried to visit “ his ” lake . DT clearest threat came from Van Dittmar himself in 2011 , when he publicly stated IN he and other Hidden Lake S.A. employees MD defend Lewis ’ private property by “ fighting with blood , if PRP have to . ” Van Ditmar RB VBD IN he MD keep locals from accessing DT lake “ with a Winchester [ rifle ] in hand , with blood if necessary . ” In 2012 , DT region ’s Supreme Court upheld DT 2009 ruling , as did Argentina ’s national Supreme Court a NN later . However , Lewis and Van Ditmar refused to open DT Tacuifi road , Van Ditmar saying IN DT treacherous but “ very pretty ” mountain path should instead be used to access DT lake . Argentine NNP Macri RB stepped in and echoed Van Ditmar , stating IN DT lake is even more accessible than before Lewis bought DT property . DT court battle continues to today , after DT Supreme Court of Río Negro in 2016 withdrew its previous ruling and ordered IN a JJ hearing with different judges issue a JJ ruling . Critics accused Lewis of using extreme “ political pressure ” at DT regional and local level in order achieve this very surprising ruling . Despite DT , locals continue to fight for JJ access to Lago Escondido and defend Argentina ’s sovereignty over Lewis ’ private empire . DT main manifestation of this effort is an annual “ March for Sovereignty , ” DT most recent of which took place in early February of this NN . DT march is organized by DT Foundation for DT Cultural Integration and Promotion of NNP ( FIPCA ) , which is run by former Argentine marine Julio Cesár Urien . IN DT prior marches of DT same name , its participants walked for nearly three days on foot over DT mountain trail to arrive on DT shore of DT lake , which – as mentioned above – PRP were within their legal rights to do . Upon arriving , PRP were met by Lewis ’ private security as well as members of DT Río Negro police , who cornered them and told them IN PRP MD n’t even VB to DT bathroom without fear of arrest for trespassing , even though lakeshores are RB legally considered JJ spaces . Guillermo Martín Caviasc — a journalist for Barricada TV , who was present at DT demonstration — called DT combination of local police and private security Lewis ’ “ private army ” and remarked IN DT police officers present where “ in a situation of subordination IN if PRP were visiting a foreign NN controlled by Lewis . ” Two participants in DT march , Andrea Gatabria and David Ramallo , mounted inflatable kayaks with DT intention of placing an Argentine flag in a small island in DT middle of DT lake , itself technically a JJ space . Before PRP made PRP to DT island , two speedboats belonging to Hidden Lake S.A. circled DT kayaks in an effort to capsize them while taunting them , asking “ Do PRP VB what PRP ’s IN to die from hypothermia ? ” After half an hour of taunts WDT seemed more IN death threats , Lewis ’ private security knocked over DT kayaks , leaving Gatabria and Ramallo floating in DT freezing NN . After several minutes , several witnesses stated IN CD of DT security guards told DT two kayakers “ Well , now do PRP see what PRP ’s IN to die of hypothermia ? ” Gatabria and Ramallo were , after some NN , lifted into DT guard boats , but had spent so much NN in DT frigid NN WDT both had to be hospitalized . National Senator for Río Negro , Magdalena Odarda , demanded accountability for DT actions of Lewis ’ private security and local police and FIPCA has begun legal action against Hidden Lake S.A. for threatening DT lives of march participants . Neither Hidden Lake S.A. nor Lewis’ Tavistock Group , which oversees his business interests in Argentina and elsewhere , responded to MintPress inquiries regarding DT incidents against march participants . While Argentines have routinely experienced intimidation and aggression when attempting to access DT lake , some foreigners have had very different experiences . Take , for instance , Scott Leahy * , an American now living in Chile , who , during a past trip to El Bolsón , was able to waltz right through onto Lewis ’ Lago Escondido property when he was in DT company of two ex-IDF soldiers who had been RB before . Leahy told MintPress IN when he was backpacking through Argentine Patagonia in 2010 with a Chilean friend , he had met and become friends with two young Israelis who had recently finished their service in DT IDF and were staying at DT same youth hostel . CD day , these two Israelis offered to take Leahy and his friend to what PRP called a “ secret beach ” nearby . PRP all piled into a car and , upon taking a gravel road off of Route 40 , arrived at a gate WDT Leahy confirmed to MintPress was DT Tacuifi road entrance to Lewis ’ Lago Escondido property ( seen in an image earlier in this report ) . Leahy was unsure about continuing , given IN DT gate was closed and , as a foreigner , he was unfamiliar with DT area . However , DT Israelis urged him on , saying IN PRP had been RB before and knew where PRP were VBG . When DT group of backpackers encountered Hidden Lake S.A. employees and guards , DT Israelis explained IN PRP were from Israel and wanted to bring their friends to DT beach . DT Lago Escondido employees told DT pair IN DT group was not officially allowed to enter DT property , but PRP MD pass . Leahy did n’t VB anything of PRP at DT NN , and told MintPress IN he had assumed DT pair knew DT owner , though DT Israelis never mentioned Lewis at all and PRP showed no interest in meeting with him either . This suggests IN PRP were not personal friends of Lewis , but RB shows IN PRP knew IN PRP MD access DT lake without problem , even in DT absence of a formal invitation . While this anecdote suggests IN DT claims of Lewis hosting thousands of IDF soldiers annually MD indeed have something to them , PRP RB serves as a very troubling comparison to DT way Argentines have been treated when trying to access DT very same lake . Indeed , if foreigners , Israelis in this case , were amicably waved through despite no invitation from Lewis or Hidden Lake S.A. , why are Argentines who try to do DT same met with such violence and aggression , particularly when PRP have a legal right to do so ? Stealing El Bolsón ’s resources for his own use Though JJ access to Lago Escondido has been a major issue of contention between Lewis and DT NNS of El Bolsón since DT late 1990s , concerns IN DT British billionaire was intent on controlling DT region ’s NN supply multiplied when firms connected to Lewis began to move forward with what is often referred to as simply DT “ Laderas project . ” As early as 2004 , a man named Cipriano Soria started telling his neighbors IN he had “ sold ” his land in an area known as Pampa de Ludden ( Ludden ’s Plain ) to Lewis . However , Soria did not technically own DT land , which was a publicly - owned nature reserve , but was granted an easement by DT provincial NN of Río Negro to use its meadows to graze his livestock as long as he paid a “ grazing license . ” Despite DT fact IN PRP was neither legally nor properly sold to Lewis , Lewis began to make plans for DT land — plans WDT ignored DT fact IN DT area was and technically remains under several legal protections due to its ecological and strategic importance to DT region . Lewis intended to use this land to build a private airport in DT area but was met by strong local resistance in 2005 , including from DT local group Assembly for DT Defense of NNP and Land ( ADAT ) . Several members of ADAT live in Mallín Ahogado next to Pampa de Ludden , which provides DT adjacent farming community of 2,000 with nearly all of its NN . Felicitas Libano , who lives in Mallín Ahogado , told MintPress IN DT importance of this area as a critical NN resource — as well as its ecological importance as an old - growth native forest — led PRP to be named a nature reserve WDT was supposed to be prevented from falling into private hands . ADAT ’s eforts were successful and Lewis ’ plan for DT area seemed to have been defeated or , at least , put on hold . Then , in 2009 , DT town voted on Lewis ’ private airport , with more than 79 percent of voters opposing PRP . However , unluckily for DT NNS of El Bolsón , Lewis had much bigger plans than just an airport and he was n’t planning on letting local democracy VB in his way . Fro 2006 to 2009 , legal arrangements were made between DT ski center ’s owner , DT Club Andino Piltriquitrón , and DT provincial NN WDT opened up DT local ski center at DT Perito Moreno mountain to “ third party ” management . Then , in 2009 , Mirta Soria , Cipriano ’s daughter , “ inherited ” DT land from her father — land WDT he technically did not own yet was somehow granted permission to purchase from DT NN , along with another protected territory between Pampa de Ludden and DT ski center , even though DT NN was forbidden from doing so by regional and local laws . Just six months after she bought this territory and sold more than half of PRP to Van Ditmar ’s brother - in - law Samy Mazza . This JJ and very large area under Van Ditmar / Lewis control is where El Bolsón ’s , in addition Mallin Ahogado ’s , NN reserves are located . Soon after DT land purchase occurred , two businesses appeared — Laderas of Perito Moreno Association S.A. and Laderas of Parallel 42 , both of which are directly connected to Lewis and were given ownership of DT lands in Pampa de Ludden and DT other area recently purchased by Van Ditmar ’s relative . DT same NN , both of these linked businesses proposed a “ lottery ” whereby DT provincial NN MD select a private company to manage DT local ski center . Laderas of Parallel 42 won DT lottery . Subsequently , DT other Laderas company , Laderas of Perito Moreno , began plans to transform DT land illegally acquired by Van Ditmar ’s brother - in - law , Samy Mazza , as well as DT portion still owned by Mirta Soria into a luxury subdivision of more than 1,000 luxury homes for wealthy Argentines and foreigners , along with a golf course , shopping centers , an artificial lake , and a private airport . This planned venture was subsequently promoted by pro-Lewis businessmen and NN outlets as necessary for DT successful development and improvement of DT ski center . With DT court battle underway and DT project still lacking approval from El Bolsón ’s city council , DT regional governor , Alberto Weretilneck – a well - known Lewis ally – teamed up with Lewis - associated local businessmen in an effort to strongly pressure El Bolsón ’s mayor at DT NN , Ricardo García , to sign a pledge IN , once legal issues were resolved , DT project MD be fast - tracked for approval . García refused and Weretilneck along with other Lewis associates in DT area began to push for his resignation . However , local protests kept García in power and , before leaving his post as mayor , García issued a decree WDT temporarily prohibited DT Laderas project from advancing . Clearly unhappy with this turn of events , DT Laderas firms challenged DT suspension of DT project in court . Around this same NN , members of local groups WDT had opposed DT Laderas project reported several incidents of violence and intimidating acts , including threatening phone calls , their cars being set on fire , and DT burning of a radio station as well as a community center in Mallín Ahogado . In DT case of architect and local politician Luis Martin , he was threatened with “ lynching ” by two Lewis associates – local businessmen Juan Carlos Martínez and Fabián Tornero – and his home was later broken into by armed thugs , CD of whom accidentally cut himself with his machete and later fled DT scene . Before escaping , DT man had told Martin , “ PRP have PRP targeted , PRP are VBG to kill PRP . ” In a 2011 article in Tiempo Argentina , Martínez referred to Lewis as “ my friend ” and was noted as a regular participant in meetings with Van Ditmar . DT same article goes on to note IN , in those meetings with Van Ditmar , Tornero is “ influential ” and further notes IN Tornero is a known associate of Lewis . In 2015 , after García ’s decree was challenged in court by Lewis ’ firms , a judge ruled IN DT decree was legal but had not been written properly and therefore cancelled PRP . Soon after , a JJ pro-Lewis mayor and city council took charge and quickly signed a legal agreement with DT Laderas companies , allowing them to build a “ smaller project , ” while claiming IN any attempt to block DT project – as García had done – MD lead to another costly , lengthy legal battle WDT DT municipal NN just MD n’t afford . However , as Guido Augello told MintPress , this was hardly accurate , given IN DT local NN MD have appealed DT decision regarding DT decree , suggesting IN this was just a convenient excuse to fast - track DT project . A few months after signing this agreement with DT Laderas firms , DT city council held a JJ hearing at which DT vast majority of attendees from DT community overwhelmingly rejected and criticized DT project . Not getting DT response PRP had hoped for , DT council held a “ secret ” extraordinary meeting — secret because PRP declined to give DT NN DT required notice needed to register to attend and participate in DT meeting . With no NN having registered , Pogliano decided to keep DT meeting “ closed ” and placed police officers at DT entrances to keep DT townspeople out by force . DT council subsequently decided to approve DT Laderas project . Angry locals moved to occupy local NN buildings in response , where PRP were targeted by riot police with tear gas . DT move generated several large - scale protests in El Bolsón , which started in 2016 and continued into 2017 . Local resistance to DT actions taken by DT city council and mayor in relation to DT Laderas project included a citizen occupation of DT main plaza for three months , which was subject to police intimidation and violence , as well as three major protests , including DT largest in El Bolsón ’s history . DT march against DT Laderas project attracted an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 participants — quite a feat considering IN DT town ’s urban and rural population boasts little more than 25,000 total inhabitants . DT reason for this mass mobilization , according to Augello , was IN “ even JJ of DT NNS WDT VBP Lewis or believe his ‘ Uncle Joe ’ image oppose DT Laderas project ” and its associated airport . PRP ’s not hard to understand why , considering IN electricity and NN intended for DT townspeople of El Bolsón MD soon be diverted to DT wealthy outsiders who buy homes in “ Lewislandia , ” a derogatory term used to describe DT Laderas project by some locals . Yet , not only does Lewis intend to privatize El Bolsón ’s NN reserves , he and those developing his Laderas project RB plan to divert DT tourism WDT keeps its economy alive by instead diverting traffic from DT main highway ( Route 40 ) into his newly planned “ city , ” according to Federico Soria , a member of DT Union of Patagonian Assemblies who has extensively researched Lewis ’ local businesses . In an extensive 2016 article on DT Laderas project and other Lewis - linked ventures , Soria wrote : PRP is DT intention of DT developers of Laderas to unite DT complex to Route 40 through two paved roads WDT PRP plan to build north and south of El Bolsón … . DT Laderas variant road MD be an advantageous shortcut [ around El Bolsón ] . …[ This ] MD benefit Lewis but economically endanger DT community of El Bolsón … ” Furthermore , in 2016 , Lewis completed a hydroelectric plant on DT Escondido River — in DT name of another of his local firms , Patagonia Energía — which passes through his property and feeds into DT lake of DT same name . However , he was granted permission to do so only if he connected DT plant to El Bolsón in order to help DT town resolve its ongoing and highly problematic electricity shortages . Once DT plant was connected to El Bolsón , Lewis MD become DT main electricity provider to El Bolsón , as its current , aging diesel generators MD be shut down . Yet , instead of following DT planned route for DT power line WDT MD give power to El Bolsón , PRP was diverted to DT planned zone for DT Laderas project , where PRP has remained “ stopped ” for NNS , even though his license to use DT river for electricity production expired in 2015 owing to his company ’s failure to connect DT plant to El Bolsón in DT NN allotted by DT license . As in so JJ other NNS , Lewis and his companies have suffered no repercussions and continue to use DT river for private power production . This situation has led some locals to speculate IN Lewis has no intention of ever providing hydroelectric power to El Bolsón and PRP is instead a resource being guarded especially for his planned Laderas villa . In effect , Lewis and his local representatives are working DT resources PRP have acquired — NN , electricity and tourism traffic — away from DT town of El Bolsón and to DT JJ “ luxury ” town of Laderas PRP hope to build to its north , a town WDT is an extension of Lewis ’ own “ independent ” NN . If this project is allowed to be completed , DT NNS of El Bolsón will face a JJ troubling reality of resource insecurity and see its economy falter , as a crucial stream of revenue is diverted to DT personal pet project of a foreign and predatory billionaire . Yet , though Lewis won DT particular battle in 2017 , he is far from winning DT war . Soon after DT scandalous way in which DT project was approved , DT project again found itself challenged in court — placing PRP in legal limbo , unable to advance . Though DT project is supposed to be blocked from moving forward until DT conclusion of this latest legal battle , satellite images taken last August and shared with MintPress by local radio station FM Alas ( shown above ) reveal IN Lewis ’ businesses have already begun construction on DT Laderas project , a clear indication IN Lewis and his associates expect their impunity to continue . Lewis’ Tavistock Group did not respond to MintPress inquiries about DT Laderas project or DT satellite images shown above . Lewis’ “ irregular ” acquisition of Lago Escondido , DT Laderas property , and his use of private security to block civilian access to DT lake WDT is — by law — JJ property have long been decried as flagrant affronts to Argentina ’s national sovereignty . Yet , while Lewis ’ activities in and around Lago Escondido certainly do undermine existing Argentine laws , PRP is another Lewis - linked property in DT Río Negro province WDT has done far more to erode Argentina ’s national sovereignty . Though Lewis ’ plan to build an airport in Lago Escondido was technically approved but has not been able to move forward , Lewis – through his foreman Van Ditmar – purchased a sizeable property at DT same latitude as Lago Escondido , but hours away on DT Atlantic Coast . DT property MD soon become DT site of Lewis ’ private airport as well as a beachfront mansion . DT airport , located south of Playas Doradas , was completed in February of 2008 and local NN noted IN its construction was “ systemically hidden ” from DT NN and was not subject to environmental impact assessments as normally required by law . Most notably , however , EX has never been any presence of Argentine customs or any other form of Argentine NN control over what or who flies into or out of DT airport , even though DT airport is capable of receiving international flights . This point is particularly concerning in light of allegations IN Lewis receives thousands of IDF soldiers annually on his property . Joe Lewis ’ private airport as seen on Google Maps Furthermore , DT Defense Ministry of Argentina has confirmed IN not only is EX no formal NN control over what lands or takes off from this private airport , but IN EX are no radars in DT area WDT even allow Argentine authorities to track nearby flight movements , including those of international flights . This means IN no NN but Lewis and his associates knows for sure how JJ flights land or take off from this area or where these flights originate or their intended destinations . More shocking still , in 2010 then - Defense Minister Nilda Garré , in responding to a complaint from local politicians over DT flagrant illegality of DT airport , defended DT airport ’s presence by stating IN PRP “ MD be used to facilitate rapid assistance of DT NN to locals in DT event of disasters or emergencies . ” To date , in DT more than 10 NNS of its operation , PRP has never been used for any such purpose , according to those interviewed for this report . DT airport in Playas Doradas is roughly DT same size as DT airport in San Carlos de Bariloche ( though some say PRP is larger ) , and is capable of receiving at least two large commercial - size passenger planes at a NN . Much as with Lago Escondido , JJ access to DT airport is denied , owing to DT fact IN DT sprawling 15,000 hectare ( ~37,065 acres ) property surrounding DT airport is privately owned by a front company called Bahía Dorada S.A. , which itself is legally owned by Lewis ’ “ foreman ” Van Ditmar . However , DT airport itself is owned by Westwind Aviation S.A. ( formerly owned by Tavistock Aviation Argentina S.A. , a subsidiary of Lewis’ Tavistock Group . Westwind Aviation S.A. is based at Lewis’ Lago Escondido property , as is Bahía Dorada S.A.. Neither Westwind Aviation S.A. nor DT Tavistock Group responded to inquiries from MintPress regarding DT lack of Argentine NN oversight over DT airport . In order to realize DT project , Van Ditmar – an Argentine citizen – had to be DT owner of DT property , as DT area where DT airport is built falls within a “ National Security Zone ” WDT prohibits land in DT zone from being owned by foreigners on DT basis of national security interests . In addition , DT airport and DT surrounding property , much IN Lago Escondido , has a large and sophisticated private security presence . DT airport is estimated to have cost $ 20 million and Van Ditmar has publicly justified DT airport ’s existence by stating IN Lewis not only “ had DT money ” to build DT complex but IN PRP RB made his ability to travel to his Lago Escondido property “ easier . ” This latter point is hard to believe given IN DT existing airport in San Carlos de Bariloche , which receives both private and commercial planes , is several hours closer to Lewis ’ property than is his private airport in Playas Doradas . DT notable difference between DT two is IN DT private airport has no Argentine NN oversight while DT Bariloche airport does . Few knew of DT existence of DT airport or DT fact IN access to DT beach in DT area had been effectively cut off by DT Lewis / Van Ditmar project until a local woman , Elvira Linares , went on DT television program “ Documentos América , ” hosted by Argentine journalist Facundo Pastor . On DT program , Linares shared her experience of trying to pass through DT now - private territory , noting IN access to DT ocean had been illegally blocked off . She RB shared video footage she had taken of DT massive , yet largely unknown to DT NN , private airport . Mere hours after DT program aired , Linares ’ home was filled with bullet holes by still unknown assailants in what local NN described as a blatant act of intimidation WDT led National Senator for Río Negro , Magdalena Odarda , to request IN DT NN extend its protection to Linares , whose life was in danger . Efforts to contact Linares for comment for this report were unsuccessful . Senator Odarda has arguably been DT most well - known figure to demand accountability regarding DT numerous irregularities surrounding DT private airport . Odarda has , with limited success , repeatedly denounced DT airport , on DT basis of DT fact IN EX is “ no NN control ” over what or who passes through DT airport . Odarda has RB noted IN DT area where DT airport is constructed is highly “ strategic , ” which poses a danger given IN PRP is exclusively controlled by a foreigner , an Englishman . Odardo has pointed out IN DT airport is located on DT important 42° parallel , which divides DT regions of Río Negro and Chubut , and is only two hours away by plane from DT disputed Falkland Islands , which are controlled by DT NNP Kingdom but RB claimed by Argentina . This dispute dates back to DT 19th century and was DT principal factor behind DT Falklands War between Argentina and DT U.K. in DT 1980s , which JJ Argentines remember quite bitterly for DT peace treaty Argentina signed after its defeat by England . JJ Argentines have compared DT document to DT Treaty of Versailles WDT ended NNP War I . Notably , EX has been considerable evidence IN Lewis ’ airport has received planes from DT Falkland Islands , which was DT subject of a formal complaint made in 2010 to Argentina ’s defense minister by then - governor of Argentina ’s Tierra del Fuego province , Fabiana Ríos . Given DT numerous laws WDT Lewis ’ activities in Río Negro have broken at both DT local and federal level , PRP MD expect IN somebody in DT NN – at least DT local NN – MD hold him accountable . While some politicians IN Magdalena Odarda and others have tried , DT lack of impunity surrounding Lewis ’ activities largely owes to his “ friendships ” with local and regional politicians as well as DT country ’s NN . CD of DT innumerable examples is Sergio Plunket . Plunket , who is in charge of Vial Rionegrina Sociedad del Estado ( VIARSE ) , DT regional body in charge of controlling JJ roads including DT road leading to Lago Escondido , RB works as a private “ ecological consultant ” for Lewis ’ Hidden Lake S.A. Plunket RB authorized DT construction of Lewis’ Playas Doradas airport . Another clear example is Bruco Pogliano , El Bolsón ’s current mayor , who is RB Lewis ’ long - NN accountant in Argentina . Another example WDT Gonzalo Sanchez noted ( pp. 50 - 51 ) in his book , Patagonia Sold , is how Pablo Verani , ex-governor of Río Negro , started a long tradition of politicians making regular visits to Lago Escondido for Lewis - financed barbeque feasts , when he celebrated his win as DT 1997 regional governor on DT shores of DT magnate ’s privatized lake . In addition to his undeniable influence among key local , regional and even national politicians , Lewis RB enjoys considerable influence in DT regional press and several former employees of his have become important figures in local and regional NN . For example in 2016 , according to local NN , Dalila Pinacho , who long served as a lawyer and spokeswoman for Lewis ’ Lago Escondido firm Hidden Lake S.A. , became DT director of DT Nequén branch of Argentina ’s National Radio , apparently through her “ close ” connections to local politicians . Another journalist , Julio Álvarez — who described himself , to Gonzalo Sanchez in 2004 at an event in Lago Escondido , as Lewis ’ “ spokesman ” — now works at a radio station in Viedma , Argentina , and was previously DT El Bolsón correspondent for DT regional newspaper Río Negro . Lewis RB funds DT local newspaper Ruta 40 and has stakes in other local newspapers such as El Cordillerano , Bolsón Web Patagonia , and El Ciudadano in Bariloche . Eliana Almonacid , who used to work for Ruta 40 , told DT national outlet Tiempo Argentina in 2014 IN DT Ruta 40 ’s director Nancy Aleuy , who RB works for Hidden Lake S.A. , told her IN “ Lewis had bought all DT NN outlets ” in DT region . Lewis’ “ Parallel NNP ” is just DT beginning Lewis ’ control over DT local authorities and local press in Río Negro , and DT complete impunity of his actions and those of his associates , have made PRP clear IN in Argentina EX is a de facto different legal system for oligarchs IN Lewis and for DT vast majority of Argentina ’s citizens . This fact — in combination with DT control Lewis and his associates exercise over DT region ’s key resources , including its NN and NN production — has led to DT creation of what some IN Federico Soria have called a “ parallel NN ” within Patagonia . However , this “ parallel NN ” is , in reality , a microcosm of a much larger project currently underway WDT is aimed at DT domination of DT entirety of Argentine Patagonia by predatory oligarchical interests , DT majority of which are directly connected to Lewis and his associates . As will be explored in Part Two of this series , DT Soros - led oligarch network , of which Lewis is a part in Argentina , has expanded its efforts to control Patagonia ’s vast and strategic resources , including DT region ’s oil and gas wealth in addition to DT domination of its freshwater resources and hydroelectricity production . Subsequent articles will then show IN this effort is just DT beginning , as this network and its close ties to DT International Monetary Fund are being used to transfer ownership of vast NN lands to their control in exchange for “ debt relief . ” DT ultimate endgame appears to be DT expansion of this “ parallel NN ” — which Lewis has already helped to create in Río Negro and beyond , and which is controlled by small number of mostly foreign oligarchs — into a full - scale operation for extracting DT region ’s riches and exploiting its NNS Editor ’s Notes : A previous version of this article stated IN both Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and Mauricio Macri had “ friendly ” relationships with Lewis and his associates . Fernandez de Kirchner , though she has a “ friendly ” relationship with Lewis associate Marcelo Mindlin , does not necessarily have CD with Lewis but has used his private helicopter . DT sentence was updated to clarify this difference . RB , an asterisk ( * ) after a name indicates IN a person ’s real name was not used after PRP requested IN MintPress not use their real name in this report .

He fashioned a pair of wings from feathers and “ took off from DT lofty battlements of Stirling Castle for a flight to Paris . ” He did n’t make PRP to France , but he did plummet a few feet away from DT castle and break a leg . DT failure , he later claimed , was due to using feathers from chickens , which ca n’t so much fly , when he should have used eagle feathers instead . Really , DT problem had more to do with mammals IN PRP not being cut out for flight . Well , except for bats . EX are , though , critters IN sugar gliders and flying squirrels , which can pull off some pretty solid glides . But compared to DT adorable and little - known colugo , PRP got nothin’ . This is DT most accomplished mammalian glider of all — on account of being essentially a giant flap of skin — capable of soaring an incredible 200 feet from tree to tree . Its expansive membrane , known as a patagium , stretches from its face to DT tips of its digits all DT way back to its tail , so “ geometrically , PRP has DT greatest surface area WDT PRP can have between those limbs without actually evolving an entire wing IN bats did , ” VBD conservation biologist Jan Janecka of Duquesne University . With such a beautifully evolved body , DT colugo , RB known misleadingly as a flying lemur ( more on DT later ) , spends its nights leisurely gliding through DT forests of Southeast Asia . Their skeletons , while not nearly as frail as those of bats , are thinner and more elongated than DT of a squirrel , reducing their weight while increasing their surface area . And their huge eyes , Janecka says , gives them not only good night vision , but excellent depth perception — no insignificant advantage when PRP ’re coming in for a hard landing on DT trunk of a tree . Colugos are such adept gliders IN mothers have no problem bringing their babies along for DT ride . And PRP ’ll do so for quite some NN , for their young are born highly underdeveloped . PRP ’re not as helpless as , say , marsupial young ‘uns , which enjoy DT comfort of their mother ’s pouch , but certainly not as developed as most mammals . Still , DT newborns cling to mom as she sails around DT rainforest in search of food , mostly sap and leaves and shoots . And as if DT colugo ’s flappy skin were n’t bizarre enough , its teeth are shaped IN little combs . This MD be helping them in some way to feed , says Janecka , or MD play a part in grooming to snag parasites on their skin . DT ’s right . Colugos MD be brushing their hair with combs built right into their faces . Unfortunately , beyond watching mothers sail around with their babies , PRP do n’t VB much at all about DT colugo ’s social life . And efforts to keep them in captivity have largely been for naught . Remember IN these are creatures used to gliding up to 200 feet , and good luck finding DT kind of space in a zoo . “ Basically their enclosures were n’t large enough to allow them to glide long distances , ” VBD Janecka . “ And because PRP MD n’t glide , PRP MD n’t keep their patagium well maintained and dry enough . ” PRP developed infections on their skin , perhaps from a fungus , and died . Ironically enough , PRP ’s too much space in DT wild WDT ’s threatening some colugo populations . Deforestation can strand species in islands of trees , but even if loggers just thin out spots in DT forest , PRP ’s big trouble for DT colugo . PRP ’re DT most accomplished mammalian glider on NNP , sure , but if EX ’s too much space between trees , DT colugo runs DT risk of sinking right to DT ground . And as PRP can see below in DT video from National Geographic ( PRP strapped a camera to a colugo — enough VBD ) , DT creature ’s extra skin makes PRP all but worthless when anywhere but DT canopy . PRP ’s an easy target in a habitat packed with predators . Because colugos tend to live in isolated habitats and because PRP insist on emerging only at night , much of what PRP VBP about them comes from anecdotal evidence . Case in point : colugo doo - doo . PRP … moves . “ I ’ve seen some videos of fecal material WDT PRP ’ve dropped where EX ’s so JJ worms PRP ’s actually moving , ” VBD Janecka . “ PRP ’s squirming around . ” DT colugo digestive tract , PRP seems , has a really , really high parasite load . “ And DT whole dynamic , whether PRP happened to be in a population WDT has a lot of parasites or PRP ’s something WDT ’s more normal for DT colugos WDT PRP ’ve learned to deal with , DT ’s CD of those unknown questions at this point . ” What is abundantly clear is IN DT colugo has a very long digestive tract , which makes sense for a creature WDT eats trees . DT stuff takes a whole lot of NN to digest . But such long guts MD RB be acting as a sort of mansions for parasitic worms , which have lots of room to make themselves comfortable . Until someone starts studying colugo turds at length , though , PRP ’ll have to leave this CD a mystery . But thanks to Janecka and his colleagues , PRP ’re now confident of this : Colugos are primates ’ closest living relatives . So although “ flying lemur ” is a misnomer , both because colugos are n’t flying but gliding and PRP ’re not a kind of lemur , DT name is n’t RB far off . “ Because PRP have these adaptations for gliding , originally NNS sort of threw them in with bats , ” Janecka VBD . “ But when PRP looked at DT actual morphology of DT skull , EX was evidence IN PRP ’re closely related to primates . ” When Janecka and his colleagues did a genomic analysis of DT colugo , this suspicion was confirmed . PRP turns out IN around 90 million NNS ago , at DT height of DT dinosaurs ’ reign when mammals were just tiny furballs scurrying about trying not to VB stepped on , DT colugo ’s ancestors split off from our primate lineage . Some 25 million NNS later , DT dinosaurs ’ NN came to an end , leading to DT explosion of mammalian diversity . In fairness , though , PRP ’s DT arthropods and bacteria who really rule DT NN , not PRP mammals . But PRP ca n’t do cool things IN glide 200 feet or comb themselves with their teeth … or drop poop WDT moves on its own . Browse DT full Absurd Creature of DT Week archive here .

630,"A gravitational lens is a distribution of matter (such as a cluster of galaxies) between a distant light source and an observer, that is capable of bending the light from the source as the light travels towards the observer. This effect is known as gravitational lensing, and the amount of bending is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.[1][2] (Classical physics also predicts the bending of light, but only half of that predicted by general relativity.)[3]

Although Einstein made unpublished calculations on the subject in 1912,[4] Orest Khvolson (1924)[5] and Frantisek Link (1936)[6] are generally credited with being the first to discuss the effect in print. However, this effect is more commonly associated with Einstein, who published an article on the subject in 1936.[7]

Fritz Zwicky posited in 1937 that the effect could allow galaxy clusters to act as gravitational lenses. It was not until 1979 that this effect was confirmed by observation of the so-called Twin QSO SBS 0957+561.

Unlike an optical lens, a point-like gravitational lens produces a maximum deflection of light that passes closest to its center, and a minimum deflection of light that travels furthest from its center. Consequently, a gravitational lens has no single focal point, but a focal line. The term ""lens"" in the context of gravitational light deflection was first used by O.J. Lodge, who remarked that it is ""not permissible to say that the solar gravitational field acts like a lens, for it has no focal length"".[8] If the (light) source, the massive lensing object, and the observer lie in a straight line, the original light source will appear as a ring around the massive lensing object (provided the lens has circular symmetry). If there is any misalignment, the observer will see an arc segment instead. This phenomenon was first mentioned in 1924 by the St. Petersburg physicist Orest Khvolson,[9] and quantified by Albert Einstein in 1936. It is usually referred to in the literature as an Einstein ring, since Khvolson did not concern himself with the flux or radius of the ring image. More commonly, where the lensing mass is complex (such as a galaxy group or cluster) and does not cause a spherical distortion of spacetime, the source will resemble partial arcs scattered around the lens. The observer may then see multiple distorted images of the same source; the number and shape of these depending upon the relative positions of the source, lens, and observer, and the shape of the gravitational well of the lensing object.

There are three classes of gravitational lensing:[8][10]

1. Strong lensing: where there are easily visible distortions such as the formation of Einstein rings, arcs, and multiple images. Despite being considered ""strong"", the effect is in general relatively small, such that even a galaxy with a mass more than 100 billion times that of the Sun will produce multiple images separated by only a few arcseconds. Galaxy clusters can produce separations of several arcminutes. In both cases the galaxies and sources are quite distant, many hundreds of megaparsecs away from our Galaxy.

2. Weak lensing: where the distortions of background sources are much smaller and can only be detected by analyzing large numbers of sources in a statistical way to find coherent distortions of only a few percent. The lensing shows up statistically as a preferred stretching of the background objects perpendicular to the direction to the centre of the lens. By measuring the shapes and orientations of large numbers of distant galaxies, their orientations can be averaged to measure the shear of the lensing field in any region. This, in turn, can be used to reconstruct the mass distribution in the area: in particular, the background distribution of dark matter can be reconstructed. Since galaxies are intrinsically elliptical and the weak gravitational lensing signal is small, a very large number of galaxies must be used in these surveys. These weak lensing surveys must carefully avoid a number of important sources of systematic error: the intrinsic shape of galaxies, the tendency of a camera's point spread function to distort the shape of a galaxy and the tendency of atmospheric seeing to distort images must be understood and carefully accounted for. The results of these surveys are important for cosmological parameter estimation, to better understand and improve upon the Lambda-CDM model, and to provide a consistency check on other cosmological observations. They may also provide an important future constraint on dark energy.

3. Microlensing: where no distortion in shape can be seen but the amount of light received from a background object changes in time. The lensing object may be stars in the Milky Way in one typical case, with the background source being stars in a remote galaxy, or, in another case, an even more distant quasar. In extreme cases, a star in a distant galaxy can act as a microlens and magnify another star much farther away. The first example of this was the star MACS_J1149_Lensed_Star_1 (also known as Icarus), that is to date the farthest star ever observed, thanks to the boost in flux due to the microlensing effect.

Gravitational lenses act equally on all kinds of electromagnetic radiation, not just visible light, but also in non-electromagnetic radiation, like gravitational waves. Weak lensing effects are being studied for the cosmic microwave background as well as galaxy surveys. Strong lenses have been observed in radio and x-ray regimes as well. If a strong lens produces multiple images, there will be a relative time delay between two paths: that is, in one image the lensed object will be observed before the other image.

Henry Cavendish in 1784 (in an unpublished manuscript) and Johann Georg von Soldner in 1801 (published in 1804) had pointed out that Newtonian gravity predicts that starlight will bend around a massive object[11] as had already been supposed by Isaac Newton in 1704 in his Queries No.1 in his book Opticks.[12] The same value as Soldner's was calculated by Einstein in 1911 based on the equivalence principle alone.[8] However, Einstein noted in 1915, in the process of completing general relativity, that his (and thus Soldner's) 1911-result is only half of the correct value. Einstein became the first to calculate the correct value for light bending.[13]

The first observation of light deflection was performed by noting the change in position of stars as they passed near the Sun on the celestial sphere. The observations were performed in 1919 by Arthur Eddington, Frank Watson Dyson, and their collaborators during the total solar eclipse on May 29.[14] The solar eclipse allowed the stars near the Sun to be observed. Observations were made simultaneously in the cities of Sobral, Ceará, Brazil and in São Tomé and Príncipe on the west coast of Africa.[15] The observations demonstrated that the light from stars passing close to the Sun was slightly bent, so that stars appeared slightly out of position.[16]

The result was considered spectacular news and made the front page of most major newspapers. It made Einstein and his theory of general relativity world-famous. When asked by his assistant what his reaction would have been if general relativity had not been confirmed by Eddington and Dyson in 1919, Einstein said ""Then I would feel sorry for the dear Lord. The theory is correct anyway.""[17] In 1912, Einstein had speculated that an observer could see multiple images of a single light source, if the light were deflected around a mass. This effect would make the mass act as a kind of gravitational lens. However, as he only considered the effect of deflection around a single star, he seemed to conclude that the phenomenon was unlikely to be observed for the foreseeable future since the necessary alignments between stars and observer would be highly improbable. Several other physicists speculated about gravitational lensing as well, but all reached the same conclusion that it would be nearly impossible to observe.[7]

Although Einstein made unpublished calculations on the subject,[4] the first discussion of the gravitational lens in print was by Khvolson, in a short article discussing the “halo effect” of gravitation when the source, lens, and observer are in near-perfect alignment,[5] now referred to as the Einstein ring.

In 1936, after some urging by Rudi W. Mandl, Einstein reluctantly published the short article ""Lens-Like Action of a Star By the Deviation of Light In the Gravitational Field"" in the journal Science.[7]

In 1937, Fritz Zwicky first considered the case where the newly discovered galaxies (which were called 'nebulae' at the time) could act as both source and lens, and that, because of the mass and sizes involved, the effect was much more likely to be observed.[18]

In 1963 Yu. G. Klimov, S. Liebes, and Sjur Refsdal recognized independently that quasars are an ideal light source for the gravitational lens effect.[19]

It was not until 1979 that the first gravitational lens would be discovered. It became known as the ""Twin QSO"" since it initially looked like two identical quasistellar objects. (It is officially named SBS 0957+561.) This gravitational lens was discovered by Dennis Walsh, Bob Carswell, and Ray Weymann using the Kitt Peak National Observatory 2.1 meter telescope.[20]

In the 1980s, astronomers realized that the combination of CCD imagers and computers would allow the brightness of millions of stars to be measured each night. In a dense field, such as the galactic center or the Magellanic clouds, many microlensing events per year could potentially be found. This led to efforts such as Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, or OGLE, that have characterized hundreds of such events, including those of OGLE-2016-BLG-1190Lb and OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb.

In general relativity, light follows the curvature of spacetime, hence when light passes around a massive object, it is bent. This means that the light from an object on the other side will be bent towards an observer's eye, just like an ordinary lens. In General Relativity the speed of light depends on the gravitational potential (aka the metric) and this bending can be viewed as a consequence of the light traveling along a gradient in light speed. Light rays are the boundary between the future, the spacelike, and the past regions. The gravitational attraction can be viewed as the motion of undisturbed objects in a background curved geometry or alternatively as the response of objects to a force in a flat geometry. The angle of deflection is:

toward the mass M at a distance r from the affected radiation, where G is the universal constant of gravitation and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. This formula is identical to the formula for weak gravitational lensing derived using relativistic Newtonian dynamics [21] without curving spacetime.

Since the Schwarzschild radius is defined as and escape velocity is defined as , this can also be expressed in simple form as

Most of the gravitational lenses in the past have been discovered accidentally. A search for gravitational lenses in the northern hemisphere (Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey, CLASS), done in radio frequencies using the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, led to the discovery of 22 new lensing systems, a major milestone. This has opened a whole new avenue for research ranging from finding very distant objects to finding values for cosmological parameters so we can understand the universe better.

A similar search in the southern hemisphere would be a very good step towards complementing the northern hemisphere search as well as obtaining other objectives for study. If such a search is done using well-calibrated and well-parameterized instrument and data, a result similar to the northern survey can be expected. The use of the Australia Telescope 20 GHz (AT20G) Survey data collected using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) stands to be such a collection of data. As the data were collected using the same instrument maintaining a very stringent quality of data we should expect to obtain good results from the search. The AT20G survey is a blind survey at 20 GHz frequency in the radio domain of the electromagnetic spectrum. Due to the high frequency used, the chances of finding gravitational lenses increases as the relative number of compact core objects (e.g. quasars) are higher (Sadler et al. 2006). This is important as the lensing is easier to detect and identify in simple objects compared to objects with complexity in them. This search involves the use of interferometric methods to identify candidates and follow them up at higher resolution to identify them. Full detail of the project is currently under works for publication.

Microlensing techniques have been used to search for planets outside our solar system. A statistical analysis of specific cases of observed microlensing over the time period of 2002 to 2007 found that most stars in the Milky Way galaxy hosted at least one orbiting planet within .5 to 10 AUs.[23]

In a 2009 article on Science Daily a team of scientists led by a cosmologist from the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has made major progress in extending the use of gravitational lensing to the study of much older and smaller structures than was previously possible by stating that weak gravitational lensing improves measurements of distant galaxies.[24]

Astronomers from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, the results of which are accepted for publication on Oct 21, 2013 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters (arXiv.org), discovered what at the time was the most distant gravitational lens galaxy termed as J1000+0221 using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.[25][26] While it remains the most distant quad-image lensing galaxy known, an even more distant two-image lensing galaxy was subsequently discovered by an international team of astronomers using a combination of Hubble Space Telescope and Keck telescope imaging and spectroscopy. The discovery and analysis of the IRC 0218 lens was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters on June 23, 2014.[27]

Research published Sep 30, 2013 in the online edition of Physical Review Letters, led by McGill University in Montreal, Québec, Canada, has discovered the B-modes, that are formed due to gravitational lensing effect, using National Science Foundation's South Pole Telescope and with help from the Herschel space observatory. This discovery would open the possibilities of testing the theories of how our universe originated.[28][29]

Albert Einstein predicted in 1936 that rays of light from the same direction that skirt the edges of the Sun would converge to a focal point approximately 542 AUs from the Sun.[32] Thus, a probe positioned at this distance (or greater) from the Sun could use the Sun as a gravitational lens for magnifying distant objects on the opposite side of the Sun.[33] A probe's location could shift around as needed to select different targets relative to the Sun.

This distance is far beyond the progress and equipment capabilities of space probes such as Voyager 1, and beyond the known planets and dwarf planets, though over thousands of years 90377 Sedna will move farther away on its highly elliptical orbit. The high gain for potentially detecting signals through this lens, such as microwaves at the 21-cm hydrogen line, led to the suggestion by Frank Drake in the early days of SETI that a probe could be sent to this distance. A multipurpose probe SETISAIL and later FOCAL was proposed to the ESA in 1993, but is expected to be a difficult task.[34] If a probe does pass 542 AU, magnification capabilities of the lens will continue to act at farther distances, as the rays that come to a focus at larger distances pass further away from the distortions of the Sun's corona.[35] A critique of the concept was given by Landis,[36] who discussed issues including interference of the solar corona, the high magnification of the target, which will make the design of the mission focal plane difficult, and an analysis of the inherent spherical aberration of the lens.

Kaiser, Squires and Broadhurst (1995),[38] Luppino & Kaiser (1997)[39] and Hoekstra et al. (1998) prescribed a method to invert the effects of the Point Spread Function (PSF) smearing and shearing, recovering a shear estimator uncontaminated by the systematic distortion of the PSF. This method (KSB+) is the most widely used method in weak lensing shear measurements.[40][41]

Galaxies have random rotations and inclinations. As a result, the shear effects in weak lensing need to be determined by statistically preferred orientations. The primary source of error in lensing measurement is due to the convolution of the PSF with the lensed image. The KSB method measures the ellipticity of a galaxy image. The shear is proportional to the ellipticity. The objects in lensed images are parameterized according to their weighted quadrupole moments. For a perfect ellipse, the weighted quadrupole moments are related to the weighted ellipticity. KSB calculate how a weighted ellipticity measure is related to the shear and use the same formalism to remove the effects of the PSF.[42]

KSB's primary advantages are its mathematical ease and relatively simple implementation. However, KSB is based on a key assumption that the PSF is circular with an anisotropic distortion. This is a reasonable assumption for cosmic shear surveys, but the next generation of surveys (e.g. LSST) may need much better accuracy than KSB can provide.

317,"Anyone buying Kamasi Washington‘s latest album, Heaven and Earth, expecting four LPs’ worth of shimmering spiritual jazz was in for a surprise: There was actually a fifth.

Sealed inside a perforated pocket in the center of the package is The Choice, an unannounced record (or, on smaller racks, a CD) featuring 38 additional minutes of Washington, a more smoothed-out affair including covers of songs made famous by the Shirelles (“Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow”) and the Five Stairsteps (“O-o-h Child”). To access it, fans actually have to slice open the package.

“The whole idea of the record to me is a record of empowerment,” says Washington of Heaven and Earth — even without The Choice, an undertaking that was over two hours long. “We do have the power to kind of make this world what we want it to be. But we have to just choose to do it ourselves and not wait for someone else. … It was in there, it’s in the music without The Choice, but I just wanted to kind of reiterate it with [the hidden record] aspect of it.”

“Kamasi had the idea that he wanted to pretty much hide The Choice,” says Phil Lee, creative director of Young Turks-adjacent label XL Recordings. “So that was kind of the brief: How do we hide a piece of vinyl, a CD and ultimately some digital content as well?”

Washington says he envisioned this album as a three-part suite early on. He knew he wanted to have Heaven and Earth and then something that was kind of in between them: “So, for a long time The Choice was called In Between,” he says with a laugh.

The team had a few challenges beyond hiding it well. It had to be cost-effective and easy to make. They had to keep it hush-hush. Washington’s hands were full: He was in the middle of touring and dealing with a very intense, months-long mixing process with Russ Elevado. He was also hoping to visit the salt flats of Bolivia for the album cover concept because, says Washington, “the ground reflects the sky because it’s such really flat surface.” On the go, Washington shared scribbles and ideas for the packaging with the label over Skype or sent videos.

“I was, like, trying to bust out my arts-and-crafts skills to try to make the homemade version,” says Washington. “My original idea was that it would be like a box and you have two albums in it, but then there’d be another box in between those two albums, and you’d have to figure out how to get into that box. Apparently gluing a box into a box is not as easy as one might think.”

“We very consciously didn’t want it to be a deluxe item,” says Lee. “We could have easily put this in a box. But obviously boxes as a rule of thumb are more expensive. We definitely didn’t want it to feel like it was a luxury item. Hopefully we kept the price competitive for a four-piece vinyl. … Hopefully people felt that they were getting a little treat.

“Manufacturing plants would … go off for, sometimes days [or] weeks and test this on our behalf,” Lee continues. “So it was definitely a long drawn-out process. We had multiple samples that we were testing. And, again, Kamasi’s on the road, so we’re shipping these around the world or trying to do it via Skype. But ultimately it was the testing and testing and testing that got us to the point where we felt that the package was true to the original concept and I guess being able to be executed on a practical level.”

The finished vinyl package features The Choice sandwiched between two gatefold sleeves holding the other four LPs: the result of an assembly process that is part manufactured, part handmade. The only hint of the bonus album’s presence is a little perforation at the top.

“We definitely didn’t want people to destroy [the packaging] but we definitely felt that … there was … action needed,” says Lee.

“You know, that saying,” says Washington, “if you wanna make an omelette, you gotta break a few eggs.”

With the design settled, the only thing left was to do keep it like a secret.

“We did have a few questions from people going, ‘Wow, that seems a little bit expensive for four pieces of vinyl and two CDs,'” says Lee. “So, yeah, that was a tricky time. It would have been easy for us to kind of let on and let people you know, ‘Yeah, don’t you worry, you’re getting a little surprise.’ But we held our nerve.

“In an ideal world people would take this home and potentially discover it days, weeks or months later,” he continues. “Obviously with the beauty of the Internet these days, we knew that once someone had done it, then everyone would know.”

Indeed, social media was buzzing about it on the day of release. Some people on Twitter caught on fairly quickly, and blog posts from the Vinyl Factory, Exclaim! and Noisey soon followed. On their day-of-release Best New Music review, Pitchfork provided a parenthetical: “According to Discogs, a surprise third part, The Choice, comes as a CD tucked away in the album’s packaging; it wasn’t provided to reviewers, but it’s reported to contain five tracks — almost 40 minutes of additional music.” Eventually they provided a second review exclusively of The Choice.

“My thought process was it was gonna be a few weeks before people would start to, like, feel this thing in there and go, like, ‘I wonder if there is something in there,'” says Washington .”I was actually surprised. Like, I don’t see how … because I wouldn’t have known. I thought we did pretty good job of hiding it but I guess apparently not.”

Maybe he can hide it better next time?

“Yeah, hide it in their house,” jokes Washington. “Like, you buy the record, somebody comes in the house and hides the record in your closet or something.”",mainstream
1208,"Updated on Oct. 11, at 3:34 p.m. ET

Monday is Columbus Day, time to buy appliances on sale and contemplate other things that have nothing to do with Christopher Columbus. So much of what we say about Columbus is either wholly untrue or greatly exaggerated. Here are a few of the top offenders.

1. Columbus set out to prove the world was round.

If he did, he was about 2,000 years too late. Ancient Greek mathematicians had already proven that the Earth was round, not flat. Pythagoras in the sixth century B.C.E. was one of the originators of the idea. Aristotle in the fourth century B.C.E. provided the physical evidence, such as the shadow of the Earth on the moon and the curvature of the Earth known by all sailors approaching land. And by the third century B.C.E., Eratosthenes determined the Earth's shape and circumference using basic geometry. In the second century C.E., Claudius Ptolemy wrote the ""Almagest,"" the mathematical and astronomical treatise on planetary shapes and motions, describing the spherical Earth. This text was well known throughout educated Europe in Columbus' time. [Related: Earth Is Flat in Many People's Minds]

Columbus, a self-taught man, greatly underestimated the Earth's circumference. He also thought Europe was wider than it actually was and that Japan was farther from the coast of China than it really was. For these reasons, he figured he could reach Asia by going west, a concept that most of educated Europe at the time thought was daft — not because the Earth was flat, but because Columbus' math was so wrong. Columbus, in effect, got lucky by bumping into land that, of course, wasn't Asia.

The Columbus flat-earth myth perhaps originated with Washington Irving's 1828 biography of Columbus; there's no mention of this before that. His crew wasn't nervous about falling off the Earth.

Yes, let's ignore the fact that millions of humans already inhabited this land later to be called the Americas, having discovered it millennia before. And let's ignore that whole Leif Ericson voyage to Greenland and modern-day Canada around 1000 C.M.E. If Columbus discovered America, he himself didn't know. Until his death he claimed to have landed in Asia, even though most navigators knew he didn't. [Top 10 Intrepid Explorers]

What Columbus ""discovered"" was the Bahamas archipelago and then the island later named Hispaniola, now split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic. On his subsequent voyages he went farther south, to Central and South America. He never got close to what is now called the United States.

So why does the United States celebrate the guy who thought he found a nifty new route to Asia and the lands described by Marco Polo? This is because the early United States was fighting with England, not Spain. John Cabot (a.k.a. Giovanni Caboto, another Italian) ""discovered"" Newfoundland in England's name around 1497 and paved the way for England's colonization of most of North America. So the American colonialists instead turned to Columbus as their hero, not England's Cabot. Hence we have the capital, Washington, D.C. — that's District of Columbia, not District of Cabot.

This is hotly debated. Syphilis was presented in pre-Columbus America. Yet syphilis likely existed for millennia in Europe, as well, but simply wasn't well understood. The ancient Greeks describe lesions rather similar to that from syphilis. Perhaps by coincidence, an outbreak of syphilis occurred in Naples in 1494 during a French invasion, just two years after Columbus' return. This sealed the connection.

But aside from descriptions of syphilis-like lesions by Hippocrates, many researchers believe that there was a syphilis outbreak in, of all places, a 13th-century Augustinian friary in the English port of Kingston upon Hull. This coastal city saw a continual influx of sailors from distant lands, and you know what sailors can do. Carbon dating and DNA analysis of bones from the friary support the theory of syphilis being a worldwide disease before Columbus' voyages.

Columbus wasn't a rich man when he died in Spain at age 54 in 1506. But he wasn't impoverished. He was living comfortably, economically speaking, in an apartment in Valladolid, Crown of Castile, in present-day Spain, albeit in pain from severe arthritis. Columbus had been arrested years prior on accusations of tyranny and brutality toward native peoples of the Americas. But he was released by King Ferdinand after six weeks in prison. He was subsequently denied most of the profits of his discoveries promised to him by Ferdinand and Queen Isabella.

After his death, though, his family sued the royal crown, a famous lawsuit known as the Pleitos colombinos, or Columbian lawsuits, lasting nearly 20 years. Columbus' heirs ultimately secured significant amounts of property and other riches from the crown. Also, most European navigators understood by the end of the 15th century, before his death, that Columbus had discovered islands and a large landmass unknown to them.

With all this talk of a hapless Columbus accidentally discovering the New World, as well as the subsequent genocide of native cultures, it is easy to understand the current backlash against Columbus and the national holiday called Columbus Day, celebrated throughout North and South America. This isn't entirely fair.

While Columbus was wrong about most things, he did help establish knowledge about trade winds, namely the lower-latitude easterlies that blow toward the Caribbean and the higher-latitude westerlies that can blow a ship back to Western Europe. Also, while Columbus wasn't the first European to reach the Western Hemisphere, he was the first European to stay. His voyages directly initiated a permanent presence of Europeans in both North and South America.

News of the success of his first voyage spread like wildfire through Europe, setting the stage for an era of European conquest. One can argue whether the conquest was good or bad for humanity: that is, the spread of Christianity, rise of modernism, exploitation and annihilation of native cultures, and so on. But it is difficult to deny Columbus' direct role in quickly and radically changing the world.

415,"A lone, tiny ant stands guard over a bright green leaf. A sleepy sea lion rests its head on the sandy coast of a Galapagos island. Two icy towers jut out from a flat Antarctic landscape, as the sun behind them dips into a pastel-colored sky. These arresting scenes—along with many others—were captured by entrants into BMC Ecology’s fifth annual photography contest, which seeks to highlight the diverse beauty of the natural world.

BMC Ecology, an open access journal, recently published an editorial showcasing the competition’s winners and honorable mentions. Chris Darimont, a conservation scientist at the University of Victoria, Canada, judged the overall contest, and the editors for each section of the journal selected their favorite images related to their areas of specialty.

“Having the input of such respected scientists as our judges ensures our winning images are picked as much for the scientific story behind them as for the technical quality and beauty of the images themselves,” the journal explains.

The photos were taken by “shutterbug-ecologists from across the world,” according to the editorial. The competition’s top prize went to Ana Carolina Lima, who captured a cluster of Giant South American Turtles in Brazil’s Cantão State Park. The yellow-flecked head of a single turtle is in frame, resting atop the ruffled shells of its companions.

“The Park is located in the Brazilian ‘Savanna’ or Cerrado, a biodiversity hotspot that is yet poorly known but is thought to be equally or even more biodiverse than the Amazon ecosystem,” Lima writes in a caption that accompanies the photos. “I was there as part of a research group working in the field to collect data on the status of reptiles and amphibians’ populations for conservation purposes.”

A photo by Roberto García-Roa of the University of Valencia bursts with wondrous activity. The image depicts a spider sitting atop a white plant and devouring an unfortunate bee, which is simultaneously being attacked by a parasitic fly—four different species interacting in one dramatic moment.

“This picture, by encapsulating a four-way species interaction, perfectly illustrates the complexity of species interactions by illustrating the dependence of species on each other, but also the fabulous power of evolution to optimize all the energy available in a food web and to generate aesthetic entities,” section editor Simon Blanchet said of the photo.

In other images, the action is more subtle. A photo by Michelle Achlatis of the University of Queensland in Australia, which won the “Editor’s Pick” category, appears to show a disconcertingly empty coral reef. But if you look closely, you’ll spot the wide eye of an octopus, which camouflages seamlessly into the surrounding reef.

Heron Reef, the area in which the photo was taken, was not affected by the back-to-back bleaching events that have devastated large portions of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. But “how well-armed these reefs are against intensifying climate change and other anthropogenic pressures is questionable,” Achlatis writes in the photo’s caption.

The winner of the “Conservation Ecology and Biodiversity” category depicts another threatened species. Zhigang Jiang, a professor at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, captured a photo of a male Tibetan antelope guiding its “harem” of female mates across a grassy plateau.

“Tibetan antelope are an endemic species to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,” Jiang explains. “Its population once reached several millions on the alpine meadows in the heartland of the plateau. However, the population of Tibetan antelope dramatic decreased to 70–80 thousands after the mad poaching for its precious wools at the end of 20th century.”

The full selection of the competition’s winning and commended images can be seen on BMC’s Ecology’s website. Together, the photos offer a rare glimpse into Earth’s diverse ecosystems—and provide yet another reminder of what we stand to lose if we fail to protect our planet’s wildlife.",mainstream
628,"Germany is in the forefront in advancing workers' rights in Europe. We have the Germans to thank for the Social Chapter, for instance, which forbids employers to exploit their staff for more than 48 hours a week.

Now imagine the Germans' horror at the discovery of a hole in their own welfare net. It turns out that one profession - the oldest - has somehow been left out. But remedy is at hand. Women's Affairs minister Christine Bergmann announced last week that prostitutes may be given the full protection of the law, starting with employment contracts with their bosses.

Presumably they would then enjoy the same benefits as other Germans: six weeks' holiday, fully paid maternity leave, a pension, and protection from being fired on the grounds of health, pregnancy or age. What's more, they would be able to sue employers and clients for sexual harassment.

It turns out that the American colonel in command of anti-narcotics surveillance in Colombia missed something right under his nose: his wife, Laurie Ann Hiett, has sent half a dozen parcels of cocaine to New York through the diplomatic pouch, each worth $30,000 wholesale.

""I had no idea what was inside. I did it as a favour for my chauffeur,"" she told military investigators.

Her driver, Jorge Alfonso Ayala, who has worked 15 years for the American embassy, counters that Mrs Hiett was a habitual user and often used to send him out to score cocaine in the Colombian capital.

In June, the United States Southern Military Command cleared Colonel James Hiett of any prior knowledge of alleged criminal actions by his spouse, age 36, but five weeks ago he was transferred at his own request.

The US state department next week is sending out an emergency team to investigate the burgeoning cocaine traffic in Colombia.

315,"Would You Give Your Child Cocaine

hile unfunded individuals and grass-roots groups are screaming at the top of their lungs about psychiatrists drugging our children based on made-up diseases, drug companies run hourly television ads to spread the false message of chemical imbalances. That no blood is ever drawn to prove this imbalance and that no normal child has Ritalin or Prozac coursing through their veins hasn't stopped this catch-phrase from becoming our version of the flat-earth concept widely accepted 400 years ago.

 

 While teachers and psychiatrists are paired up to push drugs to ""help"" schoolchildren study, we also have TeenScreen partnering with psychiatrists coming in on the child suicide angle. Behind both groups are money-hungry billion dollar drug companies. It doesn't matter that TeenScreen identifies eighty-four non-suicidal teens for evaluation for every sixteen it correctly identifies (that's just more money for the psychiatric profession when they prescribe the drugs).

 

 For today however, let's not even argue against this fabricated disease (Attention Deficit Disorder) or this sensationalistic worry about suicide (children are six times more likely to die in automobile accidents), but instead let's take a stroll through the KNOWN side-effects of one drug which psychiatrists happily prescribe to millions.

Ritalin, Vitamin R, the Smart Pill, Kiddie Cocaine – are all names for the pill that drug-company Novartis has made famous and is in the same category as cocaine, opium, and morphine. (NOTE : Other Schedule II stimulants used to treat ADD are Concerta and Adderall and their side-effects shows striking resemblance.)

 

 Will Ritalin improve your child's grades? If Ritalin could do this, don't you think that Novartis would announce this to the world? The vast majority of children on Ritalin have either NO improvement or their actual achievement scores deteriorate. In The Learning Mystique, Gerald Coles confirms a 1978 review of seventeen studies and they all agree: ""stimulant drugs have little, if any, impact on…long-term academic improvement."" A large percentage of these children become robotic, lethargic or depressed.

 

 What about fitting in to society? Studies prove that children on psychiatric stimulants for ADHD are 46% more likely to commit one felony, and 36% more likely to commit two or more felonies.

 

 Does it make you kill? According to the American Psychiatric Association, SUICIDE is the major adverse reaction of Ritalin withdrawal. Suicides and attempted suicides only occur in three cases though: when stopping usage completely, when reducing the dosage or when continuing with the same dosage!

 

 Besides suicides, the list of school shootings and family homicides by Ritalin and Prozac kids is staggering. We all know of people who do things while drunk that they don't do when sober, so why are we surprised when we give a child a daily dose of a Class II stimulant and he does something terrible?

 

 How about impact on the body? Heart problems, blood disorders, brain damage, facial tics and death are just some of the side-effects too numerous to mention. From 1990-2000, 186 died from the use of these drugs, but because the FDA has a voluntary reporting scheme, it is estimated that this represents only 10-20% of the actual cases.

 

 However, one side-effect stands out even more: ""Ritalin can mutate the child by not allowing the child to grow to full size."" Sociologists have traced everything from sexual selection of mates to job-hiring based on height; so how permanently disfiguring is this? The literature suggests giving your child holidays from Ritalin to counter this, but children's bodies and glands operate twenty-four hours a day, not just during holidays!

 

 How about addiction? Novartis will claim that Ritalin isn't addictive. However, in a study of 5,000 children with ADHD who were followed from adolescence to adulthood, psycho-pharmacologist Susan Schenk of Texas A&M University concluded that children treated with Ritalin are three times more likely to develop a taste for cocaine. In British Columbia in the late 1980's, when heroin addicts shifted to Ritalin, the burglary rate increased 105% because while a heroin addict will inject two to three times a day, a Ritalin addict shoots up every two hours.

 

 Are there any long-term mental effects? Medical researchers in the Psychology and Pharmacology fields, Travis Thompson, Ph.D., University of Minnesota and Klaus R. Unna, M.D., University of Illinois say: ""Perhaps the best-known effect of chronic stimulant administration is psychosis. 

 Psychosis has been associated with chronic use of several stimulants; e.g., amphetamines, Methylphenidate (RITALIN), phenmetrazine and cocaine."" (So the child patient of psychiatry is now manufactured into the adult patient of psychiatry!) There is also evidence that Ritalin can cause shrinkage or other permanent physical abnormalities in the brain.

 

 Does this affect our society? How many future Beethovens, Thomas Jeffersons, Ernest Hemingways, Martin Luther Kings and Maya Angelous are we currently drugging into stupors in our schools and nation? Men and women of greatness are probably the least likely to sit still and do the normal schoolwork directed at the average student. How many non-drugged kids would have never become famous, but would have been able to hold a job at Wal-Mart, get married,",conspiracy
859,"As more and more companies are beginning to worry about the climate crisis, the fashion industry is taking a look at itself to see how it can improve, too. While helping the environment is no easy task, companies can do plenty to lower their damage to our planet. Whether it’s making materials out of recycled plastic, or even purchasing carbon offsets for every product shipped, shoe companies in particular are taking leaps and bounds towards a more climate-conscious industry.

While no shoe can be truly eco-friendly since they all use some sort of material, certain brands are trying to reduce their environmental impact. Big names like Adidas and Reebok have sustainable options, and newer environmentally-friendly companies such as Allbirds, Cariuma and Rothy’s are getting more and more popular. There are tons of brands out there making a lot of eco-friendly claims, so to help narrow it down we’ve scoured the internet to find our favorite shoes that are trying to save the planet. Check out our list below for some of the comfiest, most stylish and of course most sustainable shoes out there.

Rothy’s approach to sustainability lies in its manufacturing. Instead of using virgin and wasteful materials, the shoe company has committed to creating the woven uppers of its shoes out of recycled water bottles. At the time of publication, Rothy’s website says it has diverted over 50 million plastic water bottles that would have normally gone to a landfill.

To turn water bottles into shoes, Rothy’s takes little flakes from single-use plastic bottles, presses those flakes into little beads, then transforms the beads into threads. Some models have a mix of this water bottle thread with merino wool, which is humanely harvested and crafted at a sustainable Italian mill.

Rothy’s doesn’t stop its sustainability there. The outer soles are made from either carbon-free rubber or vegan leather. The inner sole is also created with recycled foam, this time out of bio-based castor oil and other recycled materials. If you’re interested in shoes using alternative materials, check out some of our favorites from Rothy’s below.

The Rothy’s pointed flat comes in 19 colors, and its comfy yet sophisticated silhouette is great for the office or a day around town.

A more casual flat, these shoes made from bottles come in 11 colors and, like all Rothy’s shoes, are machine washable.

An eco-friendly take on the classic Chelsea boot, this comfy shoe is super light and the best for all-day adventures.

While Cariuma doesn’t take any post-consumer or used materials to fabricate its shoes, it does source its raw materials extremely responsibly. It has detailed descriptions of where each material comes from on its website. Cariuma ensures all its cotton is fair-trade, its rubber is tapped from trees without harming them and any and all leather the company uses meets strict standards.

Cariuma carries on its commitment to reducing its environmental impact even after the shoe is made. It makes sure to package the shoes in materials that are 100% recycled and recyclable. Its packaging suppliers are all certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, a non-profit that sets standards for responsible forest management.

Many of these shoe brands are packaged in more or less sustainable materials (nothing is worse than researching the most eco-friendly shoes for them to show up wrapped in plastic!), but one thing Cariuma does that many other brands don’t is purchase carbon offsets for every single shoe it ships. That means the shipping and transportation of all Cariuma products is 100% carbon neutral. Take a little environmental dread off your shoulders and check out some Cariuma shoes below.

These low-cut sneakers are super light and the clean-cut, casual look can match any outfit.

An everyday shoe like this has never been so sustainable. With a bamboo upper the Ibi’s are super breezy and cozy.

Cariuma’s high tops add an environmentally-friendly take to the retro silhouette. Comfy and versatile, these shoes are fantastic for everything from a night out to a hardcore skating sesh.

Everlane is one of our favorite sustainable clothing brands, with a wide selection of stylishly sustainable shoes and sneakers. The brand has two models of sneakers, the Trainer and the Court. Both are made from full-grain leather from a tannery that is Gold Certified from the Leather Working Group. The sole consists of a blend of natural and recycled rubber that’s 94.2% free of virgin plastic, with a lining made from 100% recycled polyester. The shipping of the sneakers is also 100% neutral due to carbon offsets through Everlane’s partnership with NativeEnergy.

Aside from sneakers, Everlane makes tons of other fancier shoes for women including heels, loafers, boots and more. While the brand’s sustainable shoe options are impressive, its transparency is even more impressive. No matter the shoe (or product for that matter), you can easily click to a page with details about the factory it was made in. You can then determine if the products are up to your own standards. Below are some of our favorite picks from Everlane we think you’ll love.

With a pair of versatile leather sneakers like these, you’ll never have to worry about what shoes to pair with your outfit. Plus, Everlane works hard to make these some of the lowest-impact sneakers on the market.

Primarily made from recycled polyester, this boot has the perfect amount of stretch so you don’t have to sacrifice comfort for style.

The classic-looking loafer is an easy slip-on made of 100% Italian leather. A cushioned insole ensures it stays comfortable no matter what you do and where you go.

Nisolo is one of the most transparent shoe brands we’ve found. Its website has the entire company’s impact report, detailing its supply chain and the treatment of its workers. While its materials are all sourced sustainably, much of the website lays out statistics on how its workers are treated, and for good reason. At the Nisolo-owned factory in Trujilo, Peru, 100% of the team in the factory is Peruvian. On average those workers experience a 47% increase in earnings from their last jobs and for those who have been there three years or more, they’ve experienced a 152% earnings increase on average.

Nisolo is also a B Corporation, a certification with a strict set of standards that looks at a company’s entire social and environmental impact. Aside from making sure all its workers are paid fair wages and using sustainable materials, Nisolo also offers an “Ethical Marketplace,” a section on its site of handpicked products from like-minded, sustainable brands. Here’s a few of our favorites from Nisolo’s handcrafted shoes below.

Handmade in Nisolo’s own factory, this chukka mixes comfort and style. Its sophisticated look is paired with supple and soft leather so you can wear it everyday.

Nisolo’s take on the forever-fashionable Chelsea boot is handmade in its own factory in Peru and features a leather tab for an easy pull-on.

A refined version of a casual sneaker, this leather shoe is handmade at one of Nisolo’s partner factories in Mexico. Ultra-stylish and comfy, these are sure to be your new daily shoe.

We absolutely love Allbirds. The trendy, internet-famous shoes are incredibly comfortable and look great. But did you know they’re environmentally-conscious too? All the materials that go into these super cozy shoes are sustainably sourced and much better for the environment than their traditional counterparts. The merino wool, for example, comes from ethically farmed and raised sheep, because happy sheep means happy feet.

The foam in Allbirds’ soles are made from sugarcane, the laces from recycled bottles and even the eyelets are constructed from bio-TPU, a microorganism that eats plant sugars. For the shoes not made of other materials, Allbirds uses fibers responsibly taken from eucalyptus trees. The company is also certified by the Forest Stewardship Council so there’s no need to worry about deforestation when buying these cozy sneakers. If you want to learn more about Allbirds, read our review here, or check out some of our top picks below.

The brand known for making “the world’s most comfortable shoe” definitely lives up to the hype with these wool runners. So cozy you can even wear them without socks, these shoes are great for any occasion.

If you want to take comfort to the next level, these loungers are a slip-on version on Allbirds’ super cozy shoe.

A breezy take on the high top, these shoes are constructed with pulp from a eucalyptus tree for maximum comfort and breathability.

Veja is another shoe brand that is transparent enough to show a full look at the company’s practices here on its own website. The brand focuses on using organic, raw materials and fair trade to make high quality shoes without any shortcuts. Veja claims it costs five times more to make its shoes than traditional counterparts because of all these steps, but the end result is a beautiful shoe that’s also good for the planet.

The company is also pushing the boundaries by using alternative materials such as B-Mesh (created from plastic bottles), fish leather and more. While the company is doing many things to make its shoes friendlier for the planet, it admits there’s room for improvement. If you dig Veja’s shoes, check out a few we love below.

A super stylish everyday shoe, the V-10’s are one of our favorite all-around sneakers. Plus the bright orange on this model adds a nice pop of color to the traditional white shoe.

Veja’s V-10 also comes in a Colorblock model, which features bold color combinations including an all-gold sneaker that’s sure to catch some attention.

We didn’t know we needed a Veja and Madewell collaboration, but we’re so happy it happened. These polka dot shoes are super cute and ready to pair with any and every outfit.

Adidas is a huge name in the shoe industry, which is why it means so much that the athletic brand is taking initiative in making eco-conscious shoes. Its Adidas x Parley collection creates shoes using plastic trash cleaned from remote beaches and coastal communities. Parley cleans plastic from polluted areas then sends the cleaned materials to Adidas where it’s formed and spun into “Ocean Plastic,” a high-performance yarn that’s used in a wide variety of shoes, shirts and tights. Each piece in the collection is made with at least 75% trash picked up from the ocean.

The Adidas x Parley collection is a huge step in the right direction for a massive shoe company like Adidas. Browse through the entire ocean-saving collection here, or our picks below.

The Ultraboost is one of the most popular shoes out there. Now you can grab your go-to workout shoe in a new, more sustainable model.

These tennis shoes are super comfortable and responsive, giving you the best performance on and off the court.

These superlight shoes are great for long runs and their rugged sole can tackle any terrain.

Exercise brand Reebok is also getting into the environmental game with its Cotton + Corn shoe. With a 100% cotton upper and a bio-based TPU sole derived from corn, it’s the first ever 75% USDA certified biobased shoe. The insole is made from castor bean oil to increase the natural content, plus the shoes are even wrapped in 100% recycled packaging.

This shoe is a good start, and we’re excited to see where Reebok takes this sustainable technology next. Take a look at Reebok’s Earth-conscious shoe below.

Sleek and stylish, Reebok’s venture into alternative materials culminates in this shoe, which comes in two colors, lavender and off-white.

You may not have heard of Icebug before, but it’s making big waves in the sustainable shoe world. The brand’s recently become the very first outdoor shoe brand to be carbon positive. Not only is Icebug reducing the amount of carbon it produces, the company also purchases additional carbon offsets to actively help the Earth.

Following the UN’s Climate Neutral Now proposition, Icebug assessed its environmental impact and decided to change. To limit its carbon emissions, Icebug has started using more recycled materials and low-impact dyes. It’s in the process of switching all its manufacturing sites to solar energy and promises to keep purchasing carbon offsets to counterbalance the rest of its emissions. Take a look at some of these outdoor, carbon positive shoes below.

A high-performance winter boot, these are fleece-lined for ultimate warmth and feature the year-round traction Icebug is known for.

If you’re taking your runs to the snow, nothing will fare better than these super grippy running shoes perfect for laps around the neighborhood.

Trudging through the snow never looked this good. With a Chelsea boot profile, these heavy duty winter boots are water-repellent and have a warm fleece lining ready for any snowstorm.

Toms is widely known for its buy-one-give-one program, but now the certified B Corporation is taking a step further in the direction of sustainability. Part of a new line named earthwise, Toms constructed new fabrics, dyes and insoles to make its shoes more sustainable than ever. Toms’ new fabric called “Repreve” is constructed with post-consumer plastic bottles, directly diverting plastic waste from our oceans. The earthwise canvas shoes are dyed with chemical-free plant dye derived from natural botanicals. Plus, the lining is made from Tencel Lyocell, which is a soft fiber made from wood pulp harvested from responsibly-managed forests. And the new OrthoLite insole is made with 26% earth-friendly content, mainly from recycled or plant-derived materials.

Toms claims it wants to keep improving earthwise to become more sustainable, and we’re eager to see where it takes this line. Right now, Toms’ more earth-friendly shoes are available for men, women and children in classic, low-profile designs. You can browse through the entire collection here, or peek at our favorites below.

Made with Repreve and Ortholite, much of this shoe is constructed with recycled materials. Plus, it’s 100% vegan and equipped with elastic gore to make it easy to take on and off.

These casual slip-ons are ultra lightweight. They come in four colors — blue, gray, pink and yellow — which are all made with plant dye. Just note that since the color is natural, there may be some color variation.

Also made with plant dye, these men’s slippers have a bulkier rubber sole. They’re super comfy and perfect for a stroll through the park or around town.

276,"The 64-year-old adventurer reportedly plummeted straight down after a launch into space Saturday afternoon, TMZ reported.

Alarming video shows a parachute separating from the vessel after the launch before plunging hundreds of feet nose-down.

Hughes reportedly sought to reach an elevation of 5,000 feet on Saturday in a steam-powered rocket.

Hughes’ representative, Darren Shuster, who wasn’t present at Saturday’s launch, lamented his client’s demise.

“When God made Mike he broke the mold,” Shuster told TMZ. “The man was the real deal and lived to push the edge. He wouldn’t have gone out any other way!”

Hughes was a hero among Flat Earth adherents and had launched himself numerous times into the atmosphere to confirm his theory.

“I don’t believe in science,” Hughes told The Associated Press in 2017. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air. . . . But that’s not science, that’s just a formula. There’s no difference between science and science fiction.”

Saturday afternoon, deputies from the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department were called to the crash scene near Barstow, Calif., where a man was pronounced dead, reported The Sun.

In 2018, Hughes managed to ascend 1,875 feet over the Mojave Desert, reported BusinessInsider.com.

Hughes also appeared in “Rocketman: Mad Mike’s Mission to Prove the Flat-Earth,” a 2019 documentary that chronicled the adventurer’s attempt to soar high enough to confirm his Flat Earth beliefs.",mainstream
195,"There’s a ton of fakery around, but that’s to be expected. We live in duality. It’s our job to fine tune our perception and distinguish between the false and the real.

in our society today – or at least a great many things are. This is the final part 4 of the series of exposing the monumental amount of fakery that exists in our world today (click here for part 1, part 2 and part 3). The real will always be stronger than the fake, but first you need to recognize which is which.

Below are the final 8 areas of fakery to round out the top 40:

The rate of staged false flag operations, whether they be false flag shootings or false flag bombings, has been increasing. It almost seems like there’s one that goes by somewhere every month. It’s Another Day, Another False Flag. Maybe this is due to how effectively the elite can fool the general population, and scare them into giving up their rights and supporting the centralization of power. Yet, at the same time, there is also a growing awareness of a critical mass of people who see right through these events. After all, we have been exposed to a lot of them.

In the last 15 years, here is a brief and incomplete list of 21st century false flag ops:

– the Bali bombings in Indonesia of 2002

– the Malaysian Flight 17 of 2014 (falsely blamed on Russia)

– the “Sydney Siege” in Australia of 2014

and so on. There are many more that didn’t make that list. Paul Watson of InfoWars pointed out a few years ago how even the military term false flag had begun to permeate in the mass consciousness and had cropped up way more as a search term online. Remember how InfoWars reporter Dan Bidondi asked a Boston official, on live TV just as it was unfolding, whether the Boston Marathon bombing was a false flag event? It would appear with the rising consciousness that the elite are going to be hard pressed to keep using false flag operations – unless they take it to a whole new level with perfect, undetectable holograms.

Related to the fakery of false flag operations are the fake crisis actors used by the MSM to attempt to deceive you. The alternative media has done a great job exposing the extent of fakery here, including exposing crisis actors at Sandy Hook, the Boston Marathon, the Charleston shooting and many other events. On several occasions, the lying MSM even used the same crisis actors (see here and here) for different false flag events!

While the threat of bioweapons, including those that are constructed to target certain ethnicities, races or segments of society, is quite appealing to an elite cabal bent on depopulation, the fact remains that the recent pandemics we have witnessed, especially the ebola pandemic, are exaggerated and fake. Kudos to Len Horowitz for his years of research in documenting the rise of bioweapons and fake pandemics, and also to Jon Rappoport who kept a cool head and questioned every aspect of the ebola psy-op, while many others were taken in by the propaganda. Wasn’t it telling and almost surreal the way the ebola phenomenon just suddenly dropped off the map, after the US Government allegedly gave the order to the MSM to stop reporting on it?

The moon landing is another stunning piece of fakery that has gone down in the official history books as fact. Perhaps the best pieces on the issue are Jay Weinder’s analysis, Secrets of The Shining: Or How Faking the Moon Landings Nearly Cost Stanley Kubrick his Marriage and his Life and also in this interview. Weidner presents a compelling argument that the elite convinced Stanley Kubrick to fake the moon landing in exchange for secrecy and future film budgeting. Kubrick himself was very well acquainted with the Satanic underbelly of the New World Order, and produced one of the most striking films which ever exposed it (Eyes Wide Shut), with its famous scene of a Satanic ritual orgy and sacrifice in a mansion of the elite. Kubrick died from a heart attack before the release of the film despite being reported to have been in good health with a strong heart – just another coincidence, I’m sure.

It is quite possible we went to the moon – just not in the way we were told. If you study the origins of NASA, you will realize it came out of the JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) of Jack Parson, black magician and follower of Aleister Crowley. Later, Nazi scientists joined NASA who were smuggled into the US under Operation Paperclip. Additionally, there are many Freemasons at NASA, including many of the astronauts on the 1960s and 1970s missions.

The fakery about space is not limited to the moon landing. There are numerous videos regarding the ISS (International Space Station) which look obviously faked, including one where one of the astronaut Chris Cassidy slips up and admits they are shooting the video in a US town on the ground. The Chinese also released a very suspect “space walk” where a bubble can be seen going past the astronauts’s head! There is another video showing someone with scuba gear aboard a supposed space craft. So what’s really going on in space? It’s hard to know, but these examples of fakery are easy to spot.

It has been said many times that history is written by the victors. If these victors have an agenda to dominate or set up a system of control with their newly won power to ensure they remain at the helm for many years to come, they can easily rewrite history or give us fake history in order to legitimize themselves. George Orwell wisely observed that “Who controls the present controls the past; who controls the past controls the future.” What he meant by that is that if you are currently in power, you have the means to censor information (e.g. internet firewalls, data deletion, book burning, etc.), and then, by controlling what people thought happened, you can shape the past in a favorable way so as to ensure you remain in power for the future. An obvious example is the way the Zionist-dominated press reported on World War 2 and the events leading up to it.

This is why revisionist history is so important; we need people to actively reexamine our past and work out what happened, so we can see the patterns and learn from our mistakes. As George Santayana said, “those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it”.

An overarching theme of all the fakery I have listed is that humanity has given it power all to fake authority. We have been tricked into giving over unquestioning obedience to authority, without stopping to think critically, question sources and biases, and make decisions for ourselves. It’s all too easy for someone to don a black robe, white jacket or shiny badge and appear to be somehow above you. Yes, some people have gone through a lot of hard work and training to become a judge, priest, scientist, doctor or cop, but they are still human. They still don’t know everything. What if they just memorized a lot of facts and procedures themselves without ever truly questioning it or understanding it, then just repeated and parroted it over to you?

Finally, it seems the very universe in which we live is, also, not exactly “real”. The recent upsurge and popularity of the flat earth movement (who have highlighted many interesting anomalies that can’t be explained by the globe earth model) shows that we still have some investigation to do in determining exactly what kind of place we live on. On a more fundamental level, however, we live in a fake universe in the sense that it’s a giant hologram or simulated reality. People from all walks of life have hinted at this deep truth, whether it be ancient Hindu teachings that the world is maya (illusion), researchers such as the late Michael Talbot who wrote the great book The Holographic Universe, or cutting edge scientific studies trying to prove that the holographic model of reality fits the data better than the standard models of physics.

These days there are many Western scientists putting their energy into cracking the code of our holographic reality. Mainstream media outlets are exploring the fake universe topic too. Take a look at the following:

– A study by Nick Bostrom in 2003 which proposed “at least one of the following propositions is true: (1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman” stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof); (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation. It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor-simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation.”

– A study by theoretical physicist Juan Maldacena in 1997 proposed that “an audacious model of the Universe in which gravity arises from infinitesimally thin, vibrating strings could be reinterpreted in terms of well-established physics. The mathematically intricate world of strings, which exist in nine dimensions of space plus one of time, would be merely a hologram: the real action would play out in a simpler, flatter cosmos where there is no gravity.”

– A study by Daniel Grumiller et al in 2014 proposing the holographic model of the Universe: “These field theories are the putative holographic duals to theories of gravity in three-dimensional asymptotically flat space times”

Everything is fake! The sooner you wake up to the deception the better. Let us know in the comments below what you find to be the fakest things around. Above all, remember that you can be real and true in the midst of all this. Don’t let it get you down; let it be a challenge to help you rise to your potential.

But Daniel Shenton – he is the new president – and his flock are convinced we are the fools who refuse to believe the obvious. Tell them about the moon landing and photographs from outer space and they respond (as Shenton has): “It’s easy to see how a photograph like that could fool the untrained eye.”



The moon landing was a hoax, they say, and name Arthur C Clarke as the man who scripted it. So impressed was Clarke himself by this argument that he dashed off a letter to thus: “Dear Sir, on checking my records, I see that I have never received payment for this work. Could you please look into this matter with some urgency? Otherwise you will be hearing from my solicitors.”



The modern Flat Earth Society (members are expected to walk carefully on the edge of the planet, one presumes) was founded as recently as in 1956, although such a belief has existed for centuries, and its best known proponent was Wilbur Glenn Voliva who lived in Illinois at the turn of the last century. As Martin Gardener points out in one of his books debunking such myths, “Voliva was a paunchy, baldish grim-faced fellow who wore a rumpled frock coat and enormous white cuffs. He was profoundly convinced that the earth had the North Pole in the centre and the South Pole distributed around the circumference, and made several trips around the world lecturing on the subject. In his mind, of course, he had not circumnavigated a globe; he had merely traced a circle on a flat surface.”



Actually, there is no unanimity among the flat-earthers (already an idiom in the language for those who hang on to outdated ideas in the face of proof to the contrary) regarding the shape of the earth. It is a disc, a hollow open at the poles, or just utterly flat.



Strangely enough, most adherents to the flat seem otherwise only as eccentric as the rest of us who believe in politicians and tooth fairies. Shenton, for example, does not propagate the belief that mankind descended from robots or that every night an elf turns out the sunlight only to switch it on again the following morning. He relies on the GPS to go from Point A to Point B on a curved surface, namely the part of the earth where he lives. He doesn’t believe in gravity though, and I am not sure if he thinks Albert Einstein was a mythical one-horned beast, but otherwise he could be the chappie sitting next to you in a bus and you wouldn’t know he had a screw loose.



There’s one other thing. Flat earthers believe the sun is only 32 miles across and not more than three thousand miles away.That would be more logical in Voliva’s view. “What would you think of a man,” he wrote, “who built a house in Zion (Illinois) and put the lamp to light it in Kenosha (Wisconsin) some thirty miles away?” As the headline to one of the articles in Flat Earth News once stated: ‘Whole World Deceived Except the Very Elect’.The Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland recommended belief in six impossible things before breakfast, and in a world whose secrets are being fast revealed, there aren’t so many impossible things to believe in. The flat earth provides a safety valve, allowing its fanatics to root for something without having to take out processions, write to the UN or kill those who don’t agree with the idea. It is a safe stupid notion - rather like the belief that stars are god’s daisy chain or that every time a fairy blows its wee nose a baby is born.And for that we must be grateful.",mainstream
1142,"What is a ‘free energy’ machine? It doesn’t mean ‘free’ as in the monetary sense, but more so ‘free’ as in the resource being extracted to produce the energy, as Nikola Tesla once said, is available in “unlimited quantities.”

It’s not like extracting oil from the Earth, and using that oil to power our planet because we know, first of all, that it’s destroying our planet; secondly, it’s not a limitless source of energy.

New developments in all areas of science, especially ones that don’t seem to fit the frame, always receive harsh criticism, and are dealt blows to their progress and acceptance with labels like ‘pseudoscience.’

This is discouraging, as non-material science seems to be the next catalyst for a scientific revolution, which is why hundreds of scientists from around the world are coming together to emphasize this.

“The day science beings to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.” – Nikola Tesla.

Tesla also once said that,

“Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point in the universe. This idea is not novel…We find it in the delightful myth of Antheus, who derives power from the earth; we find it among subtle speculations of one of your splendid mathematicians….

“Throughout space there is energy. Is this energy static, or kinetic? If static our hopes are in vain; if kinetic – and this we know it is, for certain – then it is a mere question of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheel work of nature.” – Nikola Tesla (source)

This is exactly what I am talking about here, and why legendary quantum physicist John Wheeler told the world that “No point is more central than this, that space is not empty, it is the seat of the most violent physics.”

The truth is that there are developments which are far more advanced than wind, solar, and other clean energy initiatives that could completely transform our planet and change the world forever. Imagine if everyone on the planet had access to clean, free, limitless amounts of energy, for an unlimited period of time?

If they do exist, and there is plenty of evidence to suggest that they do, then we are sitting on developments that can revolutionize our planet. The question is, where are they? Why is there so much red tape, and why does it take decades for a revolutionary idea and or technology to hit the mainstream?

As it turns out, it’s not the technology that will change our world, but the consciousness and intention behind our technological developments.

One great example (out of many) of delayed patent applications come from Dr. Gerald F. Ross. He filed a patent application for a new invention he had devised to defeat the jamming of electromagnetic transmissions at specified frequencies. It was not until June 17, 2014 (almost 37 years later) that this patent was granted.

The program delaying patent applications is called the Sensitive Application Warning System (SWAS).

Usually, when an application is submitted for a patent approval it requires a couple of examiners who work with the Patent office to go through their process of approval. This process usually takes approximately 1 to 2 years, but applications that are filed in SAWS must be approved by several people and can be delayed for a number of years.

It’s also important to note (as reported by the Federation of American Scientists; see article linked below for sources) that there were over 5000 inventions that were under secrecy orders at the end of the Fiscal Year 2014, which marked the highest number of secrecy orders in effect since 1994.

This is all thanks to an act many people are unaware of. It’s called the “Invention Secrecy Act” and it was written up in 1951. Under this act, patent applications on new inventions can be subject to secrecy orders. These orders can restrict their publication if government agencies believe that their disclosure would be harmful to national security.

So what type of technology is under restriction under the Invention Secrecy Act? We don’t really know, but a previous list from 1971 was obtained by researcher Michael Ravnitzky. Most of the technology listed seems to be related to various military applications. You can view that list HERE, but this is what Steven Aftergood from the Federation of American Scientists said about it:

“The 1971 list indicates that patents for solar photovoltaic generators were subject to review and possible restriction if the photovoltaics were more than 20% efficient. Energy conversion systems were likewise subject to review and possible restriction if they offered conversion efficiencies in “excess of 70-80%.” (source)

Adam Trombly and colleague Joseph Kahn designed and applied for patents for the Closed Path Homopolar Generator, a potentially revolutionary design for super-efficient generation of electrical power. In June of 1982, International Letters of Patent were published by the International Patent Cooperation Treaty Organization. You can view that patent here.

The difference between the international patents and the US patent system is that in the US the material of the patent is secret until the patent is granted, while overseas the application itself is the basis of the patent, which stands until challenged by a third party.

The abstract for the patent reads as follows:

“A co-rotating generator homopolar has a rotor (12) comprising a driver disc (30) and the co-rotating co-axial electro-magnets (32a and 32b) on each side, and has an improved operation using a magnetic return circuit low reluctance for the magnetic flux which passes through the driver disc (30). The low reluctance circuit allows the electro-magnets (32a and 32b) to produce a high intensity field with a value of the excitation current of the relatively low coil.

“Therefore, overheating is eliminated and the total potential of zero sequence generator is obtained. The low magnetic reluctance return circuit (220) is preferably formed by a co-rotating enclosure of relatively high permeability (with halves of speakers (37a and 37b) of sufficient radial and axial dimensions for holding the electromagnets and the driver disc of the rotor. the driver disc (30) is constructed preferably with a material of high permeability, low resistivity, such as iron, and may of course be integral with the cores of the electromagnets (35a and 35b).”

The Casimir Effect is a proven example of the free energy that cannot be debunked. The Casimir Effect illustrates zero point or vacuum state energy, which predicts that two metal plates close together attract each other due to an imbalance in the quantum fluctuations(source), (source).

You can see a visual demonstration of this concept here. The implications of this are far-reaching and have been written about extensively within theoretical physics by researchers all over the world.

Today, we are beginning to see that these concepts are not just theoretical, but instead very practical; the only reason they are not being widely utilized today is simply that they have been suppressed.

“There is significant evidence that scientists since Tesla have known about this energy, but that its existence and potential use has been discouraged and indeed suppressed over the past half century or more.” – Dr. Theodor C. Loder III, Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and Space, University of New Hampshire

Vacuums generally are thought to be voids, but Hendrik Casimir believed these pockets of nothing do indeed contain fluctuations of electromagnetic waves. He suggested that two metal plates held apart in a vacuum could trap the waves, creating vacuum energy that could attract or repel the plates.

As the boundaries of a region move, the variation in vacuum energy (zero-point energy) leads to the Casimir effect. Recent research was done at Harvard University, Vrije University in Amsterdam and elsewhere has proved the Casimir effect correct.

“These concepts have been proven in hundreds of laboratories throughout the world and yet they have not really seen the light of day. If these technologies were to be set free worldwide, the change would be profound, it would be applicable everywhere. These technologies are absolutely the most important thing that have happened in the history of the world” – Dr. Brian O’leary, former Princeton Physics Professor & NASA Astronaut.

Harold E. Puthoff is an American Physicist and Ph.D. from Stanford University and researcher at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin, Texas. He published a paper in the journal Physical Review A, atomic, molecular and optical physics entitled “Gravity as a zero-point-fluctuation force.”

His paper proposed a model in which gravity is not a separately existing fundamental force, but is rather an induced effect associated with zero-point fluctuations of the vacuum, as illustrated by the Casimir force.

Another astonishing paper entitled “Extracting energy and heat from the vacuum,” by the same researchers, this time in conjunction with Daniel C. Cole, Ph.D. and Associate Professor at Boston University in the Department of Mechanical Engineering was published in the same journal (source).

“Relatively recent proposals have been made in the literature for extracting energy and heat from electromagnetic zero-point radiation via the use of the Casimir force. The basic thermodynamics involved in these proposals is analyzed and clarified here, with the conclusion that yes, in principle, these proposals are correct.

So, as you can see, these are not new ideas.

“These are not just fringe scientists with with science fiction ideas. They are mainstream ideas being published in mainstream physics journals and being taken seriously by mainstream military and NASA type funders… I’ve been taken out on aircraft carries by the Navy and shown what it is we have to replace if we have new energy sources to provide new fuel methods.” – Dr. Puthoff

What’s interesting about the story from Trombly, is the fact that he mentions Paramahamsa Tewari. Tewari has also lectured with him and attended multiple conferences with Trombly. There is no shortage of videos from Trombly.

Out Of The Void (AUS DEM NICHTS) is a film that recently premiered in Austria. it’s a docudrama about Tesla’s vision and the work of Paramahamsa Tewari. You can view footage of the machine in the film and trailer (below), which has been built and independently tested as high as 250% efficiency.

In fact, a prototype of the machine was tested by Kirloskar Electric, a manufacturer of electrical generators in India. There, it exhibited 165% efficiency (over-unity).

Below is a picture with, from right, Paramahamsa Tewari, Executive Director Nuclear Power Corporation, Ret., Murlidhar Rao, Technical Director, Karnataka Power Corporation, Ret., Chief Engineer, electrical engineer, a mechanical engineer. From Left, Vice President of Kirloskar Rotating Machines Group, General Manager Hubli facility.

Tewari was successful in eliminating the back torque of the generator. What happens when you do that? He explains it on his website, where you can find more resources about him, his machine and his work.

Unfortunately, he recently passed away, and I was glad to see one of his papers recently published in Physics Essays. The full version is available on his website. Much of his work has been copied, stolen and published by many others.

You can see footage of Tewari’s machine HERE. Here is the actual video of the machine in action, taken from the film. The over unity test results are confirmed at the Kirloskar factory (India) where the vice president, factory manager, and lead electrical engineer discuss their replication of the device and over unity test results.

Below is a great picture of Tewari discussing his breakthroughts with fomrer NASA astronaut and Princeton Physics professor, Dr. Brian O’Leary:

Why am I mentioning Tewari? Because Trombly believes in Tewari’s work. According to Trombly,

“As the eighties progressed, copies of the Closed Path Homopolar Generator Patent had circulated throughout the world. One scientist, Paramahamsa Tewari, who was then Head of Quality Control for the Tarapore Atomic Power Station in Trombay, India, received permission to carry out experiments with the design.

“In 1986, Tewari (with the blessing of the late Prime Minister Rajeev Gandhi) published results of experiments carried out with a crude facsimile of the machine described in the patent. In the American Industrial Journal Magnets, Tewari wrote, ‘The test results have shown an efficiency of the machine above 250%.” It was the first time in human history that claims of greater than 100% output had been independently verified by a bona fide third party using the description of the art provided by a patent document.”

A prototype of TEWARI’S (from his own mind, not influenced by anyone, he influenced others in the field, he is an originator) machine was tested by Kirloskar Electric, a manufacturer of electrical generators in India. There, it exhibited 165% efficiency (over-unity).

The Economic Times of India seemed to be the only media outlet, other than Collective Evolution, to pick up the story.

Below is a Discussion of test results during the filming of AUS DEM NICHTS (Out of the Void), with the device in the Kirloskar facility, where again, it demonstrated over-unity efficiency.

Below is a picture with, from right, Paramahamsa Tewari, Executive Director Nuclear Power Corporation, Ret., Murlidhar Rao, Technical Director, Karnataka Power Corporation, Ret., Chief Engineer, electrical engineer, a mechanical engineer. From Left, Vice President of Kirloskar Rotating Machines Group, General Manager Hubli facility.

I could not find the study that was referenced by Trombly, but again, the powerplant mentioned and the linked story about it shows it’s validity. Before Tewari’s passing, we were in contact with him for multiple years and were helping to fund his prototype. We have no doubts about Tewari’s legitimacy.

Testimony Of Violent Suppression

Below are a couple of clips of Adam taken from the Thrive documentary. There are multiple videos and lectures by him up on Youtube, so if interested, I suggest you check it out.

“Are we really any different today? Have we really changed our acceptance towards things that won’t fit the frame?

677,"The Earth is a sphere, but Flat Earth videos are welcomed on Brighteon.com because minority views deserve a platform for speech, even if they seem bizarre

With YouTube recently announcing it’s going to explicitly down-rank Flat Earth videos (and other topics, such as 9/11 analysis videos), I’m affirming today that even though I am convinced the Earth is a sphere, Flat Earth theory videos are welcomed on Brighteon.com because minority views deserve a platform for speech (even if those views are incredibly unpopular or seem bizarre).

This is important to note, because even though I am convinced the Earth is a sphere, I also believe that dissenting views on science, astronomy, medicine, history, psychology, religion and everything else deserve a platform for speech. In other words, I agree with the free speech rights of those with whom I disagree… with certain narrow limits described below.

Brighteon.com is not a platform for Satanism, for example. Since Satanism videos are welcomed on YouTube and all the left-wing tech giants which are actually run by Satanists, there is no organized censorship of Satanism videos. Satanists don’t need an independent platform for free speech, since they already run Hollywood, public schools, the tech giants and much of the left-wing media. In contrast, Brighteon is a platform for those whose views are systematically censored… including those who discuss minority views on science, medicine, history, consciousness, religion or practically any other topic.

With YouTube now censoring videos about the Flat Earth theory, Brighteon.com become the obvious platform to host those videos without interference; with no down-ranking, no search suppression and no shadowbanning.

You won’t find the truth about 9/11 on controlled “establishment” platforms

Similarly, Brighteon is a platform that welcomes 9/11 analysis videos (from Architects and Engineers, for starters) and videos that question the official narrative on almost anything. If there’s anything we’ve all learned in the past two years, it’s that the official narrative on any given subject is almost always horsesh#t. This is even being admitted now by former mainstream media journalists like Lara Logan.

The “mainstream” media lies to you about everything, including hate crime hoaxes, the Russia collusion conspiracy theory hoax, the “safety” of vaccines, food science, medical science, psychiatric drugs and everything else under the sun. Remember, it’s the corporate media that told us the Covington Catholic school children were mean bullies, but Jussie Smollett was somehow a victim of a hate crime from racist MAGA-hat wearing white supremacists.

If any institution has been thoroughly discredited in modern society, it’s the mainstream media (and the tech giants that censor the truth to promote the media’s lies). That’s why we must keep questioning reality in every way possible. That includes allowing Flat Earth theorists to espouse their own views on public platforms like Brighteon… without the artificial shadowbanning that YouTube, Google, Facebook and Twitter put into play.

Just because the media lies about everything doesn’t mean the Earth is flat, of course. Not every alternative theory is correct. But every conscious being should have the right to argue every alternative theory they wish to explore. The thought police of the tech giants don’t even want people to consider ideas that don’t conform to the establishment narrative. And that’s a very dangerous precedent for a so-called “free society.”

If We the People cannot engage in unpopular speech — or argue minority views on any topic — then we don’t really have the freedom to think, do we?

Rest assured, as much as I disagree with the Flat Earth theory, Flat Earth videos on Brighteon.com will not be downranked in any way. They are ranked exactly the same as any other video, largely based on their title and keyword tags. We don’t track users or profile user behavior, either, so an individual’s viewing habits are not factored into any “recommended videos” algorithms.

There’s one general scientific principle on which I agree with those who espouse bizarre theories about the Earth

Although I don’t believe the Earth is flat, I do believe our entire universe is a kind of “simulation” created by an intelligent designer. I believe we are all living in a testing ground of sorts… a cosmic virtual reality simulator that was created for an intelligent purpose. Within that simulation, the Creator also created the laws of physics, the Big Bang and everything that naturally followed. From my point of view, that includes spherical planets, stars, heavenly bodies and so on.

In that sense, I agree in theory with the big idea that everything we are seeing, experiencing and moving through in our cosmos is a kind of illusion, a “Matrix” of reality that was engineered for a specific purpose. However, I do not believe the Earth is flat, since the laws of physics and gravity in a 3D space would naturally favor spherical bodies, not flat discs. Nevertheless, I agree with the principle of asking really big questions and questioning reality as a whole. Thus, the process of questioning everything is a valuable process, and those who engage in this process should in no way be artificially censored or silenced just because the establishment doesn’t like their conclusions.

Another important point in all this is why the establishment is so concerned about the Flat Earth theory in the first place. If it’s complete nonsense that no one would believe, then why is the scientific establishment so threatened by it that they’ve had to pressure the world’s largest video platform (YouTube) to overtly censor the videos? Seriously, if Flat Earth theory is so childish and stupid, then why would the science establishment feel threatened by it?

Personally, I find Flat Earth theory to be full of many obvious contradictions. For example, I find the explanation of the sun and moon being flat discs very close to Earth to be at odds with directly observable evidence. Just to be sure, I have measured the size of the sun and moon using an angular measurement device (a precision riflescope with a “mils” reticle, indicating milliradians, or units of angle in the metric system). As it turns out, the angular size of the moon does not change in the moon’s high position vs. its position near the horizon, a fact that is consistent with a spherical Earth and a spherical moon, but entirely contradicts the Flat Earth explanation for the movement of the moon.

Thus, I have the curiosity to check things out for myself and use scientific instruments to verify reality. One thing that the Flat Earth theorists have correct is the fact that most people just believe whatever they’re told, without verifying anything themselves. The average person who believes the Earth is a sphere, for example, is wholly unable to explain what evidence they have personally confirmed which would support the idea. Thus, their beliefs are founded in a herd mentality, not evidence or rational thinking.

Notably, I didn’t just trust the “official” view on the Earth and the moon; I verified the size of the moon myself. This is important since the moon’s apparent size is a rather convincing optical illusion when it is near the horizon (where it looks really large). There’s even a saying in Taiwan: “The moon in America is larger.” That’s because America has more wide open spaces where people have the opportunity to see the moon near the equator, where it appears to be unusually large. Yet according to Flat Earth theory, the moon should appear the largest when it is directly overhead, while diminishing in relative (angular) size as it approaches the horizon. If you measure the diameter of the moon using a milliradians reticle, you will find that the diameter of the moon does not change at all, no matter where it appears in the sky.

You can use Brighteon.com to present your own theories, and they’re (almost) all welcomed

The beauty in all this is that, should you disagree with my moon measurement assessment, you are free to use Brighteon.com to present your own arguments and evidence. In fact, we welcome your use of Brighteon for that purpose.

Sign up today (it’s free) and enjoy Brighteon as a platform for free speech. We are currently in the process of a huge R&D overhaul, and when Brighteon 2.0 is rolled out this April, it will be even better. We do not allow videos espousing Satanism or demonic content.

Currently, we have a ban on video game videos (i.e. video footage of people playing video games) due to the immense storage costs associated with those videos, but that ban will be lifted in April when we roll out Brighteon 2.0, because our new infrastructure dramatically lowers our storage costs and enables us to ease restrictions that have been in place so far.",conspiracy
614,"Spinosaurus had a long neck, strong clawed forearms, powerful jaws and the dense bones of a penguin. It propelled itself in water with flat feet that were probably webbed, according to a study released Thursday by the US journal Science.

The beast sported a spiny sail on its back that was 7 feet (2 meters) tall when it lived 95 million years ago - and it was big enough to pose a serious threat to local sharks.

The ancient reptile, technically known as Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, was already known to scientists from a long-ago fossil discovery, but most of those bones were destroyed in Germany during World War II.

New bones, from the predator's skull, vertebra, pelvis and limbs were found last year along an old riverbank in the Sahara desert, in the Kem Kem beds of eastern Morocco.

The discovery was a boon to paleontologists, who have had little to study when it came to Spinosaurus.

Its long tail, narrow hips and paddle-shaped feet likely helped the 50-foot-long (15-meter) creature move through the water with ease, experts said.

Spinosaurus also had dense bones to help control its buoyancy in water, and a long snout with high-set nostrils that could allow easy breathing while partially submerged.

""Taken together, these features strongly suggest that Spinosaurus was the first dinosaur that spent a significant amount of time in the water,"" said lead author Nizar Ibrahim, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago.

But not all experts are convinced that the latest findings show that Spinosaurus was a swimmer.

Ken Carpenter, director of paleontology at the Prehistoric Museum in Price, Utah, said the waters in the region might not have been deep enough for it to truly swim.

""The rivers in the land of Spinosaurus were small and undoubtedly shallow (hip deep at most),"" Carpenter told news agency AFP. ""As for the anatomical evidence, there are lots of alternative hypotheses to explain the oddities.""",mainstream
226,"The Romans had the right idea. Why take the long and winding road when one straight as an arrow will have you there in half the time?

When it comes to road trips, the beeliners might not offer the same exhilaration as an ever-changing mountain pass, but they do offer an opportunity to relax and put your feet up (metaphorically, not literally. We don't condone dangerous driving).

While the Romans all-but invented the straight road, few of the world’s longest are in and around their old territory. Here we round up the stretches of tarmac that barely require a touch of the steering wheel.

That would be the A15 between Scampton and the M180, lasting for about 18 miles with barely a wobble through the Lincolnshire countryside. Exotic.

The Corso Francia pierces Turin like a lance, jutting out to the west of the Italian city, but is only 7.3 miles. The road was built at the nod of Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy in 1711, beginning at the Piazza Statuto, ending at the Martyrs of Liberty Square in Rivoli.

The longest straight road in the world

Highway 10 has the dubious honour of boasting the longest straight section of road in the world and, judging by Google Earth, the most boring. The 162-mile stretch from Haradh to the border is straighter than Bud Abbott. Given the featureless desert either side, you might have trouble keeping your eyes open, but at least you'll struggle to crash into anything.

The most famous straight road in the world

“Australia’s longest straight road” proclaims the sign at the beginning of of the Eyre Highway on the nation’s south coast. Motorists completing the whole length will endure 90 miles without a single deviation.

Interstate 80 crosses the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, which, as the name suggests, are as flat as the road is straight. The road itself bisects the United States, from New York to California, but its journey through Utah is what excites drivers who hate steering. It’s not all boredom though - the road passes the 87-foot sculpture, Metaphor: The Tree of Utah.

North Dakota claims its Highway 46 is the longest straight road in the US and Canada. Slight bends aside, the motorway boasts a 31-mile dead straight stretch from Gackle to Beaver Greek. However, the aforementioned Bonneville Salt Flat road is meant to be longer, at 35 miles.

The straightest road that visits the most states

Behold the US Route 54, reaching from El Paso, Texas, to Griggsville, Illinois. Along the way, it enjoys a Bible-straight section that features two state lines, gracing Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.

The oldest straight road in the world

It’s not straight by modern standards, but the Appian Way was the original straight road. Connecting Rome to Brindisi, the Appian Way was named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who began and completed the first section in 312BC. In 71 BC, 6,000 of Spartacus’s slave army were crucified along the Via Appia from Rome to Capua.

187,"The speed of light has been calculated to be 186,000 miles per second. No one doubts the accuracy of this calculation; however, the use of this figure to calculate all other physical possibilities of universal properties smacks of the ancient flat-Earth theory.

It would seem that those who continue to abide by these conventional Newtonian paradigms place themselves in a rectangular box with impenetrable walls. The modern astronomer is learning more about the universe at this time in our existence than at any other.

We have witnessed the birth of a star system, found planets circling suns other than ours. We have discovered a preponderance of water not only in our solar system but in other sections of the visible universe.

If we are to come out of our box, we must look at the modern version of science. I am referring to such fields as nuclear physics, particle physics, quantum physics and theoretical physics.

Physics laboratories around the globe are experimenting with atomic particles that we have never before seen. One of these is called a tachyon particle, which seems to defy the laws of space-time.

New elements have been discovered pushing the atomic periodic table to elements 110 and 111. It has been postulated by some that when element 115 is reached, we may have an element with such a large nucleus that it will be a stable element. So far it would seem that the higher number we achieve, the more unstable the element and the half-life looks like a wisp in the wind.

If element 115 is stable, then it is predicted that its nucleus may generate a micro-gravity wave that would extend from the nucleus, and this gravity wave might then be harnessed to defeat gravity and become a fuel for propulsion of a spacecraft.

It is postulated that this type of propulsion would make faster-than-light travel possible by warping space-time.

It is also interesting to learn of a 17-year-old boy who received the Air Force’s highest science award in the 1960s. This young man had the audacity and guts to build and test a new and unusual rocket. The boy’s name was David Adair, and the engine he built was a nuclear-fusion electromagnetic containment engine. This rocket was tested successfully and had an eventful landing in that land beyond lands that doesn’t exist, the famous Area 51.

This vehicle had the capability of achieving light speed and, according to the builder, was capable of exceeding light speed with capabilities to propel an interstellar ship to the stars.

Where did David Adair, now head of Intersect Inc. in Atlanta, get the design for this engine?

As he tells it, directly from NASA. The organization evidently had 18 engine designs, and guess what? Only two were solid- or liquid-propelled rocket engines.

This was in the 1960s. I wonder what happened to the rest of those engine types in the past 30 years. I also wonder what type of engines have been and are being tested at the old Rocketdyne facility in the Santa Susana Mountains above Simi Valley.

One might ask if the massive class-action lawsuit against Rocketdyne, which alleges contamination of the nuclear type, has any relationship to the engines that were developed and continue to be developed today.

A quick drive up the mountain will prove interesting to the casual interested party, especially when confronted by the signs indicating the presence of the U.S. Department of Energy.

If we look at some of these modern concepts and then consider the possibility of extraterrestrial visitation, it doesn’t seem quite so impossible, even considering that linear light speed is still 186,000 miles per second.",mainstream
1199,"An asymptotic theory is presented for calculating co-seismic potential and geoid changes, as an approximation of the dislocation theory for a spherical Earth. This theory is given by a closed-form mathematical expression, so that it is mathematically simple and can be applied easily. Moreover, since the asymptotic theory includes sphericity and vertical structure effects, it is physically more reasonable than the flat-Earth theory. A comparison between results calculated by three dislocation theories (the flat-Earth theory, the theory for a spherical Earth and its asymptotic solution) shows that the true co-seismic geoid changes are approximated better by the asymptotic results than by those of a flat Earth. Numerical results indicate that the sphericity effect is obvious large, especially for a tensile source on a vertical fault plane.",mainstream
16,"After several failed attempts, a daredevil rocket-maker soared into the sky Saturday in a steam-powered rocket he built in his garage. ""Mad"" Mike Hughes, 61, launched himself into the heavens, he said, to confirm his theory that the Earth is flat, and shaped like a Frisbee, reports correspondent Mireya Villarreal.

After reaching an estimated speed of 350 miles an hour, Hughes pulled his parachute. He then deployed a second chute just before hitting the ground in the Mojave Desert, near Amboy, Calif. He only hurt his back.

He admitted the mission could have been deadly.

Before the launch Hughes told Noize TV: ""I think it's a good platform to raise awareness and money to get me to space.""

Hughes, a former stunt limo driver, says he's received almost $8,000 in funding from Research Flat Earth, a little-known group which believes the Earth is flat, and that the sun and the moon rotate around the outer edge.

""Do I believe that the Earth is shaped like a Frisbee or flat or whatever? I believe it is. 'Cause I cannot disprove it,"" Hughes said.

While thousands of years of science has yet to convince ""Mad"" Mike the Earth is round, he isn't alone. A number of celebrities, including basketball stars Shaquille O'Neal and Kyrie Irving, have drawn attention for supporting the theory. They've both since said they were joking.

But for Hughes, it's no laughing matter.

""This is why I want to go up into space 62 miles up, to set this thing straight for people to know,"" he said.

Hughes plans to share his observations around -- or across -- the world.",mainstream
84,"A 'self-taught rocket scientist' has failed in his bid to launch 5,000 feet (1,520m) into the air after the $325 (£270) boiler he bought off Craigslist broke down.

'Mad' Mike Hughes, 63, attempted the feat aboard his steam-powered rocket at Amboy in California's Mojave Desert.

But his budget boiler didn't have the power needed to heat water to 200°C (400°F) and generate the steam required for the rocket to lift-off.

A spokesman for Mr Hughes said that he plans to try another launch on Saturday, August 17.

'I believe the Earth is flat,' he said, but that 'this flat Earth has nothing to do with the steam rocket launches. It never did. It never will. I'm a daredevil!

In a press statement ahead of the launch, he added: The 'launch is about my personal desire to inspire my fellow Americans to help make this country great again.'

In March 2018 Mr Hughes, who believes the Earth is flat, propelled himself 1,875 feet (6,150m) into the air aboard a previous incarnation of the rocket before a hard landing in the Mojave Desert.

Mr Hughes, who lives in Apple Valley, California, has seen a flurry of criticism over his plans in recent years.

Detractors have labelled him a crackpot for planning launches in his homemade contraptions, as well as his belief that the world is flat.

'I hope he doesn't blow something up,' retired NASA astronaut Jerry Linenger said ahead of the March 2018 launch.

Linenger orbited the globe more than 2,000 times during four months in 1997. 'Rocketry, as our private space companies found out, isn't as easy as it looks.'

Mr Hughes often spars with his critics on social media and has always maintained that his mission isn't to prove the Earth is flat.

'Do I believe the Earth is shaped like a Frisbee? I believe it is,' Mr Hughes has said. 'Do I know for sure? No. That's why I want to go up in space.'

That's his project for down the road. He wants to build a 'Rockoon,' a rocket that is carried into the atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon, then separated from the balloon and lit. This rocket would take Hughes about 68 miles up.

This is the third time Mr Hughes has constructed and launched a rocket.

On January, 30, 2014, Mr Hughes said he travelled 1,374 feet on private property in Winkelman, Arizona.

He collapsed after that landing and needed three days to recover but there wasn't any footage of him climbing into the craft, leading some to question whether he even took off.",mainstream
907,"WHENEVER the Bosnians - Serb or Muslim - screamed blue murder about General Rose, former commander of UN forces in Bosnia, they must secretly have been relieved that it was only Sir Michael in charge and not his wife, who used to turn up in Sarajevo from time to time to keep an eye on things. Lady Rose is one of those formidable county wives with a cut-glass accent and a certain light in her eyes boding ill for journalists, warlords and the rest of the riffraff who comprise Bosnia's danse macabre.

Peter Jennings of the American ABC television network was once surprised to find her sitting in on an interview with her husband, and interjecting along the lines of: ""Nonsense. You can't ask him that!"" And the general himself certainly knows who's boss. Seen dining together recently in Sarajevo, the couple had some slight divergence of opinion. ""That's enough, Michael. Now shut up,"" rang out the voice of command. ""Yes dear,"" replied the hammer of the Serbs, meekly falling silent.

EVEN by the boisterous standards of criminal hearings, it was a tricky moment. Criminal lawyers, of course, have chosen a difficult branch of the profession. At law school, I remember, we were warned that they tended to pick up the bad language and dress sense of their clients. Then there's all the effort of training the defendant to look respectable - or at least not glower too terribly at the jury. And often the co-operation is just not there. In Pennsylvania last week, for example, just as A Charles Peruto Jr, was persuading the judge to grant bail to his client Howard ""Wingding"" Jones, citing the excellence and steadiness of his character, Wingding took off, out the back door and away. Even Mr Peruto had to admit ruefully that this did not aid his argument. Wingding was spotted first on the rooftops and then minutes afterwards under a pile of mattresses in a department store basement, before recapture.

NOW, a serious business story from the Himalayas. Shepherds in the Changthang valley have upset the state-run wool board, which every year buys their output of pashmina wool - a marvellous substance, so fine that shawls woven from it can be drawn through a ring, which makes every bride in India yearn to own one. Last year the board bought 30,420lb of pashmina. This year it bought 4.4lb.

Even for a state-run business, this is not very good. But the officials have an excuse. All the wool, it seems, has gone to China, since the revival of the ""ancient trade with the Chinese for tea, bricks and electronic items"".",mainstream

Cooper said teachers should not disagree with students who want to believe in the biblical theory of creationism instead of evolution as the origin of humans.

Rep. Peter Goudinoff asked Cooper what should happen if a student told his geography teacher that his parents said the world was flat.

505,"Is a widespread coronavirus outbreak inside the United States inevitable? After weeks of generally optimistic statements, officials are now warning us to prepare for the worst. Over the past several days we have seen the number of confirmed cases outside of China escalate dramatically, and this has really rattled global financial markets. After being down more than 1,000 points on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell another 879 points on Tuesday. U.S. stocks have lost more then 1.7 trillion dollars in value in just two days. Much more importantly, a wave of tremendous panic is starting to sweep across America, and it looks like this crisis is just getting started.

Usually officials at the CDC choose their words very carefully so that they do not needlessly alarm the public. With that in mind, I would like for you to consider three statements that the CDC’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier made about a potential outbreak inside the United States during a press conference on Tuesday…

#1 “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country anymore but a question of when this will happen.”

#2 “Disruption to everyday life may be severe.”

#3 “We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad.”

Can you ever recall a top CDC official ever making statements this ominous?

In addition, Messonnier warned that it may soon become necessary for schools and businesses to greatly restrict person to person contact…

The CDC outlined what schools and businesses will likely need to do if the COVID-19 virus becomes an epidemic outbreak in the U.S. Schools should consider dividing students into smaller groups or close and use “internet-based tele-schooling,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call. “For adults, businesses can replace in-person meetings with video or telephone conferences and increase teleworking options,” Messonnier said.

On a temporary basis such measures would not be too disruptive, but what if this virus just keeps spreading month after month?

We are potentially facing a scenario that is truly unprecedented, and it is becoming increasingly clear that officials have lost confidence that they will be able to contain this virus. In fact, one former U.S. official told USA Today that “the horse is out of the barn”…

Dennis Carroll, former director of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Global Health Security and Development Unit, credited China’s “extraordinary control measures” with delaying the spread of the virus. But he said avoiding a pandemic is “very unlikely.”

“The dramatic uptick of cases in South Korea, Iran and Italy are reflective of a self-sustaining spreading of the virus,” Carroll, who now leads the Global Virome Project science cooperative, told USA TODAY. “And a clear message that the horse is out of the barn.”

At this point there are still only a few dozen confirmed cases in the United States, but authorities are bracing for the worst. If you can believe it, San Francisco Mayor London Breed just declared a state of emergency because of this virus…Mayor London Breed declared a local emergency in San Francisco Tuesday amid the coronavirus outbreak, despite there being no confirmed cases among the city’s residents.

“Although there are still zero confirmed cases in San Francisco residents, the global picture is changing rapidly, and we need to step-up preparedness,” Breed said in a statement. “We see the virus spreading in new parts of the world every day, and we are taking the necessary steps to protect San Franciscans from harm.”

And after being quite apathetic about this outbreak at first, people all over America are suddenly realizing that they should be preparing for a potential pandemic.

In fact, Silicon Valley investor Geoff Lewis created quite a stir when he asked for advice on stockpiling food. The following is the question that he posted on Twitter that caused so much of an uproar…

If one were hypothetically stockpiling four months of shelf stable food, what would folks recommend (optimizing for keto friendly)?

We haven’t seen anything like this in the United States in a very long time.

But we haven’t even had a single death from this virus in our country yet. How crazed will people get when victims start dropping dead in the streets like they have been in Wuhan?

There is now talk that the IOC could potentially cancel or postpone the Olympic Games in Tokyo. At one time such talk would have seemed crazy, but this is how serious this outbreak has become.

In Iran, the number of confirmed cases has now jumped to 95, although many people believe that the true number is far, far higher.

During a press conference on Monday, Iran’s deputy health minister attempted to downplay the seriousness of this outbreak, but on Tuesday we learned that he has been infected too…

Iran’s deputy health minister said he has tested positive for the novel coronavirus and is in self-quarantine at his home just a day after he appeared at a news conference in Tehran where he sought to quell fears about the outbreak. Iraj Harirchi, the head of Iran’s counter-coronavirus task force, announced the illness in a video online while vowing that authorities would continue working to control the spread.

Apparently not wanting to be outdone, one of the officials in South Korea that was overseeing the response to this outbreak decided to jump off a bridge…But in Seoul took on a more morbid tone Tuesday following reports in the local press that a civil servant from the Ministry of Justice’s Emergency Safety Planning Office jumped off a bridge in Seoul at around 5 am local time Tuesday.

The official was one of several individuals charged with overseeing the government’s response to the virus. As cases soar and hysteria mounts, we suspect this news won’t exactly help quiet the public’s nerves.

Suicide is never the answer to anything, and we should all be praying for that man’s family.

In Italy, the number of confirmed cases has grown by more than 15 times since Friday…Over in Italy, the number of confirmed cases has surpassed 300 to 322, while the number of dead climbed to 10, according to Italian emergency chief Angelo Borrelli, who said the newly deceased were over the age of 80. That’s up from just 20 confirmed cases on Friday.

Newly deceased were over 80 years old, says at press conference in Rome Tuesday. The new infections include three cases in southern Sicily region, Italian Civil Protection official Borrelli said.

All of a sudden, people all over Europe are wanting to avoid Italians because of the potential of catching the virus. In most cases that fear is irrational, but we do know that an Italian just spread the virus to a hotel in Spain’s Canary Islands…

Hundreds of staff and tourists staying at a hotel in Spain’s Canary Islands were put under lockdown on Tuesday, El Pais newspaper reported. One person who had stayed at the establishment was later found to have tested positive for the coronavirus.

I lived in Italy for a few years as a child, and I have a great love for the country.

It is so sad to watch what is happening over there, but the same things are going to start happening here. In fact, Dr. Messonnier has told the public that now is the time “to begin preparing” for a massive outbreak…

“People are concerned about this situation – I would say rightfully so,” Messonnier said. “But we are putting our concerns to work preparing. Now is the time for businesses, hospitals, communities, schools and everyday people to begin preparing as well.”

If you do prepare and all of this turns out to be a false alarm, at least you will be ready for the next crisis that is coming.

But if you don’t do anything to prepare and things get really, really bad, it could end up costing you dearly.

If this virus starts spreading across the United States like wildfire, you and your family will want to minimize contact with the public as much as possible. So stock up on the things you will need now, because when things start getting really crazy the stores will be cleaned out very quickly.

Coronavirus spreads to Germany, Switzerland, Croatia, Iraq, Spain, Algeria, Austria and Brazil while cases explode in Italy by 45% in one day

Over the last 36 hours or so, the coronavirus spread has now been confirmed in a slew of new countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Croatia, Iraq, Spain, Algeria and Austria. Cases are already confirmed in Belgium, Lebanon, Finland, Sweden, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Israel, Cambodia, Nepal, Afghanistan, Russia and many other countries.

An infection is now suspected in Brazil, which would make it the first South American nation to confirm a coronavirus infection, bringing the virus to a whole new continent. According to Brazil’s Health Ministry, one test of a local patient has reportedly come back positive. A second confirmation test is necessary to make the diagnosis “official.”

These are irrefutable facts, yet we still have naysayers throughout the media and across the cultural landscape who claim none of this is happening, that the coronavirus bioweapon system is “just another flu,” or that it’s a grand hoax being perpetrated by all these countries as some elaborate staged event to commit economic suicide for some unknown reason.

Pandemic denialism is essentially the “Flat Earth” version of epidemiology. According to the denialists, all the nations listed above are faking it, sacrificing their national economics to carry out some sort of elaborate hoax for some unimaginable reason.

Rush Limbaugh, meanwhile, still insists the coronavirus is just “the flu.” It’s a reminder why highly influential people should stick to their areas of expertise and not wander into areas where they very quickly demonstrate their shocking technical ignorance and lack of knowledge.

Coronavirus infections exploded overnight in Italy, rising to 322 confirmed cases, an increase of 100 from the previous day.

To try to stop the spread of the virus, Italy is running armed road blocks surrounding 12 towns, prohibiting road travel.

According to The Epoch Times, no one in Italy even knows the source of the outbreak, completely obliterating any argument from WHO officials that this is “contained” or “not a pandemic.” Via TET:

Italian health officials haven’t yet identified the source of the outbreak. Angelo Borrelli, the head of the Italian civil protection department, said the case count grew from 222 to 322, representing a 45% increase, in a 24-hour period from Monday evening to Tuesday evening.

According to the pandemic denialists, of course, Italy must be faking it for some reason. Yes, it’s an insane idea, but that’s what is now being promoted by the left-wing media and even some conservative journalists.

Notably, the very bureaucrat in Iran who told everybody the virus was no big deal is now infected himself. Also via TET:

Only a day earlier, a coughing and heavily sweating Iraj Harirchi said at a televised news conference in Tehran that “the situation is almost stable in the country.”

Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour confirmed Harirchi had the virus. Harirchi himself posted an online video saying he had it and that he had quarantined himself at home. He promised that authorities would bring the virus under control.

That’s reassuring, huh? The very government bureaucrat sitting in quarantine after accidentally getting infected is telling us all the government has it under control. The irony is almost pure comedy, if it weren’t so tragic.

San Franciso declares state of emergency while media tells us there’s no emergency at all

San Francisco, meanwhile, has just declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, even when CDC officials claim there are essentially zero confirmed cases in San Francisco.

According to the SF Chronicle, Mayor London Breed said more resources need to be allocated, “to make sure we are prepared,” even while the entire media establishment in America claims there’s nothing to be prepared for in the first place.

So why did San Fran just declare an emergency, then?

792,"How do you sway people who believe that evidence-based arguments pose a threat to dearly-held worldviews? It’s a perennial question for science communicators, and a matter of constant debate. Less controversial is the idea that throwing facts and figures may serve to fortify, rather than reconcile, opposition to facts. Ironically enough, the science of science communication—a particularly unsettled field of study—suggests that aiming to simply fill in the knowledge gaps is misguided.

Given our roles as communicators, we’re often asked: how do you have meaningful conversations with people who deny well-established science? We’re not talking about unsettled questions, like whether a glass of red wine a few nights a week is good or bad for your heart. Rather, we refer to empirical truths—that the global climate system is warming, almost certainly as a result of human activity; that modern molecular genetic engineering (known as “GMO”) is no more or less risky than any other agricultural breeding technique; that vaccines do not cause autism. In our view, those who have made the transition from buying into alternative facts to weighing information more rigorously can offer valuable insight. The authors of this column fit that very bill.

One author of this piece, Cameron English, grew up in an evangelical Christian family. In that setting, rejecting established scientific thinking wasn’t only acceptable but expected. According to adherents of this worldview, evolution, for example, isn’t a theory of changes to heritable traits of biological populations over generations; it’s a ""punch to the American way of life,"" wielded to push a “secular social agenda.” Nonetheless, English transitioned from Young Earth creationist to biology enthusiast and science writer over the course of a year.

The other author, Kavin Senapathy, once accepted and even embraced television infomercials and celebrity recommendations. Between her purchases of Dr. Oz-approved supplements just seven years ago—the endorsements earned the celebrity doctor thorough reprimands from the Federal Trade Commission and congress—and her near fall into the pseudoscience-entrenched “attachment parenting” rabbit hole, it’s no exaggeration to say she was once among the most gullible consumers of information.

In retrospect, a few guidelines made it possible to move away from our own fact-scarce worldviews and now helps us have productive discussions on nuanced and often fraught subjects like food, health, and environmental policy.

A disclaimer—we know that there is a lot more to swaying those who reject empirical reality than the tips below. These suggestions come from our own conversation toolboxes.

Derision, even well-informed derision, should be used with caution

A number of prominent science educators have taken on try-hard, cheeky public personas. With sardonic op-eds and irreverent book titles, we science geeks love to fawn over our science heroes. Science fandom can be fun and educational, but its stars sometimes cross the line from education to denigration, and that’s when their efforts enter choir-preaching territory. To an audience of vaccine-hesitant parents, for instance, these popular science educators risk coming off as insensitive and uncaring. Though the public’s trust in the scientific community is generally strong, a recent series of Pew Research Center studies suggests that public trust “in scientists in matters connected with childhood vaccines, climate change, and genetically modified (GM) foods is more varied.”

Richard Dawkins helps illustrate the problem with derision-as-outreach. A brilliant scientist often rightfully criticized for his views and communication, Dawkins isn’t a very good defender of evolution because he mocks his target audience. He has often referred to religion as a “mind virus,” denigrating religious people as “delusional.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, evolution deniers aren’t interested in Dawkins’ arguments. In response, some members of the intelligent design camp turned Dawkins’ condescending attitude into a caricature of the famous zoologist: a rapping cartoon character, who rhymes about how much smarter he is than everyone else.

Scientists who want to win the trust of a public skeptical of overwhelming data can learn from Dawkins’ failure. “The other person, the person you’re trying to communicate with, is the one you have to focus on,” actor and science advocate Alan Alda told PRI last year. “Not what you want to say — what you want them to know. You’ve got to know who they are, where they are in their head while you’re communicating with them.”

The only ideology that can align with science is the ideology of empiricism—there is nothing partisan about it. But ultimately, we remember that while the power of science to fuel progress is undeniable, and that observable truths are observable truths, the purview of the natural sciences is not all-encompassing.

Still, data and evidence are paramount when it comes to empirical arguments. Scientists have to build rapport with the public before they can start discussing evidence, but some science communicators carry that basic principle to an extreme, presuming that deniers don’t care about data. Operating on this blanket assumption is not only off-putting, but can be ineffective. Indeed, those who reject empirical truths make evidence-based and data-driven arguments all the time. For those without access to or belief in the known facts of biology, like Cameron 10 years ago, these counter-consensus talking points sound sophisticated and compelling. But that’s largely because of the value-systems that drove his worldview, not necessarily because he viewed data as a nefarious enemy.

Consider the Flat Earth Society. It makes sense to think that these people believe our planet is flat simply because it looks that way to the naked eye, but they rely on plenty of seemingly scientific support to corroborate the conspiracy theory. Take, for example, the Bedford Level Experiment cited on the Flat Earth Society website. When first carried out in 1838, it seemingly demonstrated a lack of curvature over a six mile stretch of water. It was even subject to peer review according to the society. To them, this worldview is absolutely data-clad, especially given the larger context—Flat Earther belief that the government is concealing the truth with falsified data.

When presented in a relatable fashion, data can actually change minds. This is one reason why parents who reject, say, the theory of evolution, send their kids to private schools. Children aren't immune to rational arguments, so they send them to schools where they won’t be taught sound science. Fortunately, effective educators know how to break down the barriers people erect around their minds.

Take climate scientist Dr. Scott Denning, who differs starkly from Dawkins in this sense. By debating global warming skeptics, Denning illustrates how academics can build trust with the public and change their minds. Unlike some of his colleagues who think climate skeptics should be shunned or ridiculed, Denning happily interacts with them—and encourages their skepticism.

In a recent interview with one of the authors of this column, Denning explained that during a debate, he told the audience to be skeptical of doomsday climate predictions. He also identified himself as a libertarian, so his audience knew he shared their free-market values, then went on to discuss how scientists know that adding CO2 to the atmosphere warms up the planet. Denning added that audience members approached him after the event to thank him for helping them look at climate change differently.

The significance of Denning’s approach is that he gave his audience the right to disagree with him and mirrored their language and beliefs. A sales tactic described by negotiation expert Chris Voss in his book Never Split The Difference, mirroring involves mimicking your audience’s language to show that you understand their perspective. It can be incredibly effective when done authentically, as Denning illustrated in the example above. He built trust and turned his skeptical audience into a receptive one that would give his arguments a fair hearing—and convincing someone to hear you out can be one of the most insurmountable hurdles in communication. The nonprofit group RepublicEN takes a page from a similar book. By finding common ground, the group aims to convince fellow “conservatives, libertarians, and pragmatists” that “[c]limate change is real” and that it’s “the duty of all Americans to reduce the risks.”

It’s hard to step away from the keyboard when evidence-scarce and especially downright dangerous messages make the rounds online. For instance, we find it particularly disturbing to see parents being convinced—in real time—to forgo vaccinations that prevent painful and lethal illness. The urge to weaponize citations and figuratively scream at those giving bad advice can be strong. But keep in mind that these conversations are worthwhile. It’s tough to sway those who already believe solidly in their positions and distrust the science coming from government agencies and leading scientific organizations. While you may never sway the most vocal minority, engaging them—with appropriate context and compassion—can be worthwhile. For every parent who expresses an extreme and stubborn distrust for the pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccines, another may be watching, and gleaning the understanding that yes, pharma companies do sometimes behave unethically, but that doesn’t mean that vaccines are harmful.

Making inroads with those who think science is a plot to poison their kids or destroy their faith is no easy task. In a world where facts don’t seem to matter, advice from those who once rejected facts may offer hope—and a path forward.

On the 23rd of November, the exhibition opens at The Royal Academy of Arts in London with its curators hoping that art and architecture can break through the dense facts and figures dominating media coverage of the climate crisis. Using research from environmental experts as inspiration, 21 practitioners from a wide range of media including architecture, film, and immersive installation have created works in an attempt to respond to and challenge coverage of the crisis.

Practical visualisations of pollution and forward-looking imaginings of vaguely dystopian futures are displayed alongside more hopeful concepts of adaptation that exhibition co-curator Mariana Pestana explains explore what technology can do to replace the things we have lost. As engagement with climate change becomes more widespread, the RA wants to continue the tradition that started it over 200 years ago and supply artists responses to contemporary crises.

Technology can’t always provide the solution, however, as Unknown Fields highlight with their specially commissioned work, The Breast Milk of the Volcano. The short film tells an Aymara legend about how the salt flat below the Tunupa volcano is formed from her tears and breast milk after her baby was taken away. Beneath the Bolivian salt flats is the world’s largest lithium deposit, an element essential for our ongoing obsession with battery-powered devices.

In the second of the three rooms, a whole wall is dedicated to one of the exhibition's highlights, Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg’s AI reconstruction of the near-extinct northern white rhino. Using important research footage featuring the behaviours and sounds of the last herd, Ginsberg used work from Deepmind lab to have The Substitute learn from its environment. Slowly materialising into a distinct reminder of species that has been effectively lost thanks to human action, the artist wants to challenge the “techno-utopian idea that we can bring extinct animals back to life”.

Not all of the works were created especially for Eco-Visionaries; there is a bronze cast version of Virgil Abloh’s IKEA collaboration work Alaska Chair, as well as another chance to see Olafur Eliasson’s The Ice Melting series. One of the architectural models is a work inspired by the early environmental concepts of 1970s avant-garde architecture firm Ant Farm. In collaboration with WORKac, 3.C. City: Climate, Convention, Cruise imagines an island vessel shingled with solar panels and designed to facilitate interactions between species.

An interactive immersive experience created by Rimini Protokoll is possibly the most ambitious of the pieces. A tank filled with 50 live jellyfish is the visual backbone of the work as marine biologists narrate a tale of the rising tide of these marine creatures. Jellyfish are one of the rare species that benefit from increasing sea temperatures and declining biodiversity. Warmer seas extend their breeding period and damage done to populations of things like sea turtles by plastic pollution reduce the number of predators there are to eat them. “Warm water is a disaster for anything that breathes, and a dream come true for anything that doesn’t breathe much, like a jellyfish,” explains the recording.

If you are into innovative concepts designed to counteract climate change then Eco-Visionaries is well worth a look. Striking a balance between accessible communication and the integration of scientific findings it showcases past problems and future issues. Although its clear target audience is those who struggle to decipher news reports about rising sea levels with incomprehensible air pollution figures, it is difficult to imagine that there are many interested individuals who aren’t informed of the basics of the climate crisis by now.

20,"Before we can even begin discussing what a nonorientable surface is, we must understand what a surface is. This is not as trivial as it may seem. A surface is actually a two-dimensional manifold. So whatï¿½s a manifold? Basically, a manifold is a shape. When we think of shapes we normally think about circles or squares or triangles, but we want our definition of a shape to be more broad. After all, almost anything you can imagine has a shape, even though that shape may not have a specific name. Shapes may also have different dimensions. For example, a square has two dimensions, height and width, and a cube has three dimensions, height, width, and depth, but clearly both are shapes. Thus a one-dimensional manifold (or one-manifold) is just a one-dimensional shape or a curve. A two-dimensional manifold (or two-manifold) is just a two dimensional shape or a surface. Now the following question may have popped up in your head: ï¿½Wait a minute! A circle is a curve. But I need two dimensions to draw a circle, so how can a circle be a one-manifold?ï¿½ This is a very good question indeed. However, when I say that a manifold is one-dimensional, I only mean that each tiny section of the manifold looks like a line. Mathematicians would say that a one-manifold has the local topology of a line. Likewise, a two-manifold has the local topology of a plane. A three-manifold has the local topology of three-dimensional space. This may still seem a little confusing but the following example may help: Letï¿½s say that the earth was completely smooth (no mountains, hills, craters, buildings, etc.). In other words, consider the earth as a perfect sphere. Now imagine yourself walking on the earth. How do you know it is a sphere? You know the earth is a sphere because scientists have proved by numerous experiments that it is a sphere. However, from where you are standing the earth probably looks mighty flat. In other words, locally the earth is flat. This is what we mean when we say that a sphere (remember that a sphere is only a surface, it is not a solid ball) or any other two-manifold has the local topology of a plane. From now on, since we know what manifolds are, when convenient we will refer to surfaces as two-manifolds. So let's go on to a more important question for this course: ï¿½What does non-orientable mean?ï¿½ Well, here is an answer: ï¿½A non-orientable manifold has a path which brings a traveler back to his starting point mirror-reversed.ï¿½ Huh? Before we discuss what that actually means, letï¿½s talk about some orientable surfaces. Consider the sphere. Clearly this surface has no mirror-reversing effect because nobody on earth has ever returned mirror-reversed after a long journey. (A mirror-reversed person would seem to have changed handedness and would see all of our writing backwards). So presumably a sphere is orientable. The sphere also has some nice properties. You can walk in any direction on the sphere and you will end up where you started. This also means that you cannot fall off of the sphere (this is especially convenient for those of us who live on the earth). When a surface or any manifold has these properties, we say that the manifold has no boundary. But isnï¿½t the sphere itself a boundary for the space it encloses? Remember that when we talk about two-manifolds we are only considering the surface itself. For all we know, the space that a sphere encloses does not even exist. Imagine that you are a two-dimensional being living in the surface of the sphere. (Those of you who have read Flatland by Edwin Abbott Abbott should have no trouble visualizing this.) You have no conception of the three-space that might exist outside of your world. Your entire world simply looks like one infinite plane. Therefore, a two-dimensional being living in the surface of the sphere would truly believe that his world had no boundary, even though it has a finite area. Letï¿½s now consider another orientable surface, the torus. We usually think of a doughnut in association with a torus, but the following picture is also a torus: We call this a flat torus for obvious reasons. Although it does not look like a torus, it contains the instructions for building a torus. Notice that if we glue the sides with corresponding arrows together, we will end up with a doughnut shape. If we keep in mind that when you go off each side of the flat torus you return at the same spot on the opposite side, the flat torus will have the same properties as the folded torus. In other words, the flat torus has the same topology as the folded torus. For our purposes, it will be much easier to consider the flat torus than the folded torus, so from now on when we say ï¿½torusï¿½, we mean ï¿½flat torusï¿½. Like the sphere, the torus has no boundary. When we go off an edge, we return on the opposite side, so it is impossible to leave the surface. What would we have if we changed the torus so that you could not go off the top or the bottom of the surface? Well, now we glue only the left and right sides together so we get a cylinder. Since we are blocked off if we try to go off the top or the bottom, the cylinder does have a boundary. In fact it has two boundaries, one for the top and one for the bottom. This distinction will become important in a moment. Here's a model of a folded torus you can play around with, so you can get an idea of an orientable surface. Use your mouse to rotate the object. 

 But now letï¿½s change our torus diagram to look like this: Notice that now the left and right sides of this surface are connected with a twist. If I leave the box towards the top of the left edge, I will return towards the bottom of the right edge. Furthermore, I will be mirror-reversed. Although I am facing the same way I was before (I am still facing the left edge), the hand that was formerly my left hand is now my right hand and vice versa. Thus we have found our first nonorientable surface! The surface we have just discovered is called a Moebius strip. And the best thing about a Mobius strip is that we can actually build it. (We will soon see that most nonorientable surfaces cannot be built in three-space). Itï¿½s easy to build. Just take a strip of paper and attach the ends with a single twist. You should end up with something like the following picture: 

 

 Try rotating the picture with your mouse to get different views. The Moebius strip (also sometimes called a Mobius band) has a boundary just like the cylinder, but it only has one boundary, not two. If you trace along the edge of the Mobius strip you just built, you will cover the entire boundary, eventually returning to the place where you started. Now that we have discovered one nonorientable surface we can create many more. In fact, any surface (or any manifold at all) which has a Moebius band in its structure is nonorientable. The following example may help convince you. Here are the instructions for our next surface: This surface is similar to the Moebius strip except that now the top and bottom are glued together as they were in the torus. Likewise, we could also think of this surface as a torus with a Moebius strip in it. However, if you try to build this surface you will find that it is impossible. As it turns out, you cannot build this surface in three-space without having it intersect itself. If we lived in the fourth dimension, we could build it. This new surface is called a Klein bottle. Although the Klein bottle cannot be built in three-space, we can project it into three-space from four-space using computers. In fact, as long as we are content to have it intersect itself, we can even make three-dimensional models of those projections. Here are two different projections of the Klein bottle generated by computers: 

 This is the usual projection of the Klein bottle. (Like above, you can move this with your mouse.) This is the ""Figure 8"" projection of the Klein bottle. (Like above, you an move this with your mouse.) The Klein bottle has a mirror reversing effect just like the Moebius strip, but it also has the nice property of having no boundary so you can go off what looks to be the edge in the diagram without ever really coming to the edge. We will consider one last nonorientable surface before moving onto three-manifolds. The surface is called the real projective plane (or just projective plane) and it can be constructed in a variety of ways. One way to think about it is to take the flat Klein bottle diagram and connect the top and bottom edges with a twist in addition to the left and right edges: Another way to model the projective plane is to start with a hemisphere and connect each point on the rim to its corresponding point on the opposite side with a twist. Here is a picture of what we mean by this: Like the Klein bottle, the projective plane has no boundary and cannot be built in three-space without self-intersection. Here are a few computer images of projective planes embedded in three-space. You can click on the picture to learn some more about each projection from the Geometry Center: 

 

 

 Up till now, we have only considered two-manifolds, but naturally there are nonorientable three-manifolds also. However, it will be easier to consider an orientable three-manifold first. When we first considered the torus, we used a rectangle to represent the space of our manifold. Mathematicians would call the rectangle a fundamental domain for that space. Likewise, we will use a cube as a fundamental domain when we consider most of the three-manifolds. Consider a solid cube. (It is important to stress that the cube is solid or that we are talking about the space inside of the cube and not just the cubical surface). The cube itself is a three-manifold with a boundary on all sides. However, it is a pretty boring space. What if we connected the right wall to the left wall? Then when you walked through the right wall, you would return to the cube through the left wall. Better yet, you could play catch with yourself. Just throw a ball towards the right wall, turn around, and catch it as it comes through the left wall. We could also connect the front wall to the back wall and the top wall to the bottom wall. This new manifold is called a three-torus. The three-torus has no boundary and therefore if you lived in a three-torus it would seem to be an infinite space. In theory our universe could be a three-torus. If this were the case, if you looked out in any direction far enough you would see yourself (ignoring the fact that light travels at a finite speed). Of course, we cannot build a three-torus in three-space, just as we canï¿½t build a regular folded torus in the plane. More generally, a manifold without boundary, which is not infinite, cannot be built in the same dimension that its local topology consists of. What if we wanted to create a nonorientable three-manifold? How would we do it? In two dimensions we connected the edges of a rectangle with a flip. We can do the same in three dimensions. In fact there are two ways to cause a mirror reversing effect. We could connect opposite faces of the cube with a side-to-side flip or an upside-down flip. Letï¿½s say we connected the front and back walls of our cube with a side-to-side flip. Now, when you walked out the right side of the back wall, you would return on the left side of the front wall. You would also be mirror-reversed. What if we connected the front and back walls with an upside-down flip? Then, if you left the back wall standing on the floor, you would return through the front wall hanging from the ceiling (this,of course, ignores gravity). Again, you would also return mirror-reversed. Naturally we could connect each pair of opposite walls with a flip of either sort making for an extremely confusing space to live in. As an exercise, imagine connecting the walls of the cube in various ways, and then determine how you would return after leaving the cube through one of the faces. Now you may be wondering what would happen if we connected a pair of opposite walls with both a side-to-side flip and an upside-down flip. The interesting thing is that you would not return mirror-reversed at all. This is because if you get mirror-reversed twice you will return to normal. However, you will have made a 180 degree turn (you will be upside down, but your right hand will still be on your right side). Thus far we have only discussed connecting the opposite sides of our fundamental domains, but there is no reason that we could not connect the front wall of our cube to the right wall. As you can see, this would open up numerous other possibilities for the shapes of manifolds. There is in fact such a thing as projective three-space that has similar properties to the projective plane. 

 What Would It Be Like to Live On A . . . ? In the intoduction and later in Chapter 6, we presented fanciful stories about what it would be like to live in or on a non-orientable manifold. But, as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. Here are three pictures describing what it would be like for a two-dimensional flat animal to live on (remember, that means within the surface) the three non-orientable surfaces we described above. First, a two dimensional creature living in a Moebius strip. Notice how the colors switch position when the creature gets flipped. Next, the same two dimensional creature living on a Klein bottle. This time, the colors get flipped only if the creature goes off to the sides; it just comes around without flipping if it goes off the top or the bottom. Finally, a slightly different example. This ball is on a real projective plane. The changing colors symbolize a switch in orientation. Watch how the ball changes orientation regardless of which edge it goes off. If you're confused by these, imagine how confusing it would be if you were the crab or ball!",mainstream

North Korea has disclosed a series of images of the Earth it says were taken by a camera carried aboard a ballistic missile during the country's latest test.

The state-run KCNA news agency said Monday that Kim Jong Un had expressed his “great satisfaction” over Sunday's test and suggested that the weapons should be “rapidly mass produced in a serial way to arm"" his military.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported the North's state-run Rodong Sinmun published 58 images that were allegedly taken by a camera aboard the missile, describing them as ""an apparent bid to show off its missile atmospheric re-entry technology.""

KCNA added: ""Viewing the images of the Earth being sent real-time from the camera mounted on the ballistic missile, Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un said it feels grand to look at the Earth from the rocket we launched and the entire world looks so beautiful.""

The solid-fuel Pukguksong-2 missile flew about 310 miles and reached a height of 350 miles Sunday before plunging into the Pacific Ocean, the Associated Press reported.

A White House official told NBC News that the missile was of a type that was last tested in February and that it had a shorter range than tge missiles North Korea launched more recently.

South Korea held a National Security Council meeting Sunday to discuss the latest launch, which came hours after new President Moon Jae-in named his new foreign minister nominee and top advisers for security and foreign policy.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday that Seoul and Washington believe Sunday's test provided North Korea with unspecified ""meaningful data"" on its push to improve the credibility of missile technology.

But spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said the allies believe more analysis is required to verify whether the test showed the North had achieved a breakthrough in re-entry technology.

There is skepticism about North Korea's claims about its re-entry technology, which is needed to return a warhead to the atmosphere from space so it can hit its intended target.

Michael Elleman, senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told NBC News it remained hard to assess how far along North Korea is in terms of that endeavor but it appeared clear that progress was being made.

Elleman added that the North Koreans were likely showing that they had transmitted data from the missile by releasing the pictures taken during flight.

“They’re showing they’re getting telemetry data,” Elleman said. “If they are able to communicate the pictures down to the ground then they are communicating the necessary flight data that’s recorded.”

That is not a “huge leap in technology,” Elleman added.

He also questioned claims that the missile tested Sunday would be ready for production. ""We have to take everything they say with a grain of salt but they do tend to deploy things before they’re really ready. They have a history of that.""

North Korea has rejected all calls to curtail its nuclear and missile programs in recent years, calling them legitimate self-defense.

It has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland.

Sunday’s missile test follows the launch of the Hwasong-12 missile last week which North Korea claims can carry a heavy nuclear warhead.

North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States which it accuses of preparing for invasion. South Korea hosts 28,500 U.S. troops to counter the threat from the North, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.",mainstream
772,"Isaiah 40:22, “It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as 

 grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in.”

I cannot believe I am even writing this article, but as hard as it is to imagine, there are still people today who literally believe that the earth is flat. Folks, the earth is NOT flat! It is a circle, not a perfect circle, but it looks like a circle from outer space. The earth is actually a bit oblong...

American Scientific also provides information about the earth's shape...

Here is a satellite photo of the earth from NASA. Truly, a picture is worth 1,000 words...

THE EARTH IS A SPHERE, just like the moon!!!

I've heard some well-meaning but ignorant preachers twist Revelation 1:7 where it says “every eye shall see him,” which, they say, means the earth must be flat for the whole world to see Christ when He returns. Folks, let's read the whole verse from Revelation 1:7, “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.” How can all the people involved in “piercing” Jesus, that is, crucifying Him, see Him from Hell? Those were all unsaved people who pierced Jesus to the cross. Clearly, it is possible in ways that only God can understand. It is gross theological incompetence to attempt to use Revelation 1:7 to teach that the earth is flat, or dome shaped.

Kindly, for this very reason I had to stop supporting and promoting “The Common Man's Bible,” which can literally now be called “The Idiot's Bible,” because Brother Hoffman teaches in it that the earth is flat, which is insanity...

Perhaps you say, “Does it really hurt if a sincere preacher thinks the earth is flat?” Are you kidding me? The answer is a resounding, yes, yes, yes, it is very detrimental and harmful to the cause of Christ. There are a lot of unsaved people, who upon learning that a man ignorantly teaches the earth is flat, will immediately leave (and I don't blame them) from the presence of that fool.

Even the Holy Bible tells us to go from the presence of a fool. Proverbs 14:7, “Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.” I cannot think of anything more foolish, and lacking of KNOWLEDGE, than a man who denies that the earth is a sphere. Pastor David Hoffman likes to quote from the Proverbs in an attempt to bolster up his strawman argument that the earth is really flat. Mr. Hoffman even goes as far as to call people who believe the truth about the earth being a circle, “globetards.” No, Brother Hoffman is the retard!

744,"The Earth's oceans hide vast amounts of valuable minerals and metals, and as some onshore deposits run low, mining companies are looking for ways to make deep sea mining both technologically possible and profitable.

This is partly driven by the need for so-called rare earth metals to produce the magnets, batteries and microchips driving our gadgets, electric cars and wind turbines.

""New technologies have initiated the new gold rush,"" says Andrea Koschinsky, a professor of geoscience at Jacobs University in the northern German city of Bremen.

""Many of the new technologies — for example magnets of the wind turbines — need tons and tons and tons of rare earth elements.""

Some deep sea mining machines have already been built, and many countries have bought permits for deep sea mineral prospecting in a massive 1.2 million-square-kilometer (463,322-square-mile) area of the eastern Pacific Ocean.

Although no activity has started yet, environmentalists are alarmed about the potential impact on ecosystems.

Koschinsky and her team are studying the impact of machinery several kilometers down on the sea floor, where life has existed for possibly billions of years and never before been disturbed by man.

When she is not in her office, you might find her on a scientific vessel, overseeing submarines and robots exploring the dark depths of our oceans. This is the new frontier for mining companies looking for metals which could soon be in short supply onshore.

Until now, deep sea mining has been hampered by high costs and technological challenges. The most feasible method would be to harvest so-called nodules — potato-shaped rocks made of manganese oxide — from the flat sea floor some 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) down.

These could simply be picked up by specialized machinery, before being brought to the surface to be processed.""It is still associated with high cost in the beginning, but once these investments have been made — and some prototypes of well-functioning machines exist — I think it should be possible from both technological and financial sides,"" Koschinsky says.

Help from Wally the robot

Laurenz Thomsen is also a professor of geoscience at Jacobs University, working alongside Koschinsky. Using a range of heavy robots, he studies the impact their caterpillar tracks have on the soft seafloor sediment.

This is mimicking what heavy mining machinery would do when scurrying back and forth to collect the metal-rich nodules found there.

They call one machine Wally — ""because it looks a bit like the robot in the Disney animation film WALL-E,"" he explains, as he shows a yellow deep-sea robot equipped with a webcam and measurement systems, for everything from temperature and pressure to methane concentration and turbidity.

His team has been studying what they call ""the snow"" — tiny particles that are whirled up when the seabed is disrupted.

""I'm responsible for analyzing particle behavior — how the 'snow' forms,"" Thomson says. He's also looking at how this affects the animals on the seafloor.

""They are very fragile animals. They actively catch particles, and you can only find these types of animals in the deep sea when there's enough organic matter settling down.""

Manganese oxide nodules do not represent the only mining opportunity out there. So-called hydro-thermal vents, deep sea chimney-like structures spewing out minerals straight from the Earth's core, have also caught future prospectors' eyes.

Because of the warmer waters forming around these structures, they can be home to complex ecosystems. Yet Koschinsky is less worried about the possible impact on these areas from mining operations.

""These organisms are adapted to relatively quick and drastic changes,"" she says.

""They live in a toxic environment anyway,"" she explains. Such systems are frequently hit by volcanic eruptions, and then a new vent system comes up. ""So they can probably recover relatively quickly.""

Better prepared than ever

Environmental organizations are warning against a rush to explore resources hidden under the seabed, instead urging world leaders to create vast ocean sanctuaries to protect life in our oceans from further disruption.

A new study of current mining proposals around the world, published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, warns of ""long-lasting and possibly unforeseen consequences.""

In the paper, researchers at the University of Exeter and Greenpeace highlight that there are still many ""questions and uncertainties"" surrounding the deep-sea mining, including legal issues and problems associated with predicting, then later tracking, the scale of any effects.

Yet some scientists point out that this time, at least, we are better prepared to avoid negative environmental impacts — unlike damage that has resulted from the exploits of petroleum companies, large-scale fisheries and onshore mining programs.

""Maybe for the first time in humankind's history, we think about the potential environmental damage before somebody starts getting resources out of the ground,"" says Jens Greinert, head of the deep sea monitoring research unit at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany.

""On land nobody asked, with oil and gas nobody asked before,"" he adds. ""All the regulation was established after the damage was made. Now we're doing it jointly together before something happens.""

The world's first major deep sea mining program is set to begin in 2019, in the deep waters off Papua New Guinea. There, a new deep sea mining company plans to start looking for copper, zinc, gold and silver. Environmentalists and the mining industry will be monitoring their success, or lack of it, very closely.",mainstream
1341,"Having failed to win an overall majority in the UK’s general election, Theresa May’s Conservative party is hoping to foster an informal coalition with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Members of the party have taken controversial stances on everything from climate change to evolution, with one assembly member being unaware that heterosexual people can contract HIV. Here are five things you need to know when it comes to science and the DUP

The party has a history of speaking out against climate change. Senior member Sammy Wilson has called climate change a “con”, and described the Paris Agreement as “window dressing for climate chancers”. During his time as Northern Ireland’s environment minister, he said that people would eventually “look back at this whole climate change debate and ask ourselves how on Earth we were ever conned into spending billions of pounds” on the issue.

It isn’t just Wilson though – in 2014, DUP ministers tried to oppose proposals to introduce local measures against climate change in Northern Ireland.

Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK where women cannot access abortion unless their life is endangered by pregnancy – a legal situation that is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, according to a Belfast High Court ruling in 2015.

But on taking leadership of the party in 2016, Arlene Foster promised to block any attempt to change these laws, telling reporters “I would not want abortion to be as freely available here as it is in England.”

Foster did, however, say she might consider an amendment in cases of rape. But the DUP’s Jim Wells – formerly the health minister for Northern Ireland – opposes abortion even in these circumstances.

DUP assembly member Thomas Buchanan has previously called for creationism to be taught in schools. In 2016, he voiced support for an evangelical Christian programme that offers “helpful practical advice on how to counter evolutionary teaching”. He has expressed a desire to see every school in Northern Ireland teaching creationism, describing evolution as a “peddled lie”.

Buchanan told the Irish News “I’m someone who believes in creationism and that the world was spoken into existence in six days by His power,” adding that children had been “corrupted by the teaching of evolution”.

The DUP’s leader narrowly survived a no-confidence motion following a disastrous attempt to bolster green energy in Northern Ireland by providing subsidies for wood burners. Arlene Foster introduced the scheme in 2012 when she was head of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. The original budget was £25 million, but a lack of price controls meant that, over five years, almost £500 million went up in smoke.

Last year, DUP assembly member Trevor Clarke admitted that he had thought only gay people could be infected with HIV, until a charity explained otherwise. He made the comments during a parliamentary debate around a campaign to “promote awareness and prevention” of HIV in Northern Ireland and to increase support for those living with HIV.

980,"When Kyrie Irving’s trade request from the Cleveland Cavaliers went public last month, it was all but expected. At 25, the rising basketball star wanted to grow beyond LeBron James’ shadow on the court. But of all the teams to trade with, few expected the Cavs to hand one of the NBA’s most important players to their biggest rival in the Eastern Conference – the Boston Celtics. Unless there was a very good reason for doing so.

The Cavs needed a succession plan for LeBron James. And in return for Irving, they got three players (the Celtics’ Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic) and a first-round pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. While it’s less starpower, the trade ensures – regardless of James’ decision next season – the team will continue to compete and quickly rebuild if necessary.

Isaiah Thomas is also an incredibly similar player to Irving. He’s a shoot-first point guard who can create his own shot and space on the floor. In Jae Crowder, the Cavs filled a need for the type of 3-point shooter and defender they’d need against the Warriors. Together, Thomas and Crowder provide a volume scorer in the backcourt to replace Irving and a 3-and-D wing to complement LeBron James. It’s a combination the Cavs need to get to the NBA Finals next season without Irving.

The Cavaliers acquired future assets in 20-year-old Zizic as well as Brooklyn’s 2018 first-round pick that is expected to be in the lottery of the upcoming NBA Draft. In the event that LeBron James and Isaiah Thomas leave the team next summer, they will give the Cavs stability to rebuild immediately. And if James stays with the team, they can flip the 2018 first-round pick for another proven star or add a promising young rookie to their core.

Ironically, the Celtics’ acquisition of Irving is in some ways, the greater gamble. As gifted a scorer as Irving is, he has yet to prove he’s capable of being the Number One option on a contender team. The Cavaliers were a much better team with him on the court, but Irving still struggled when James was on the bench. (For example, last season the Cavs were outscored by 8.0 points per 100 possessions when Irving played without James. On the other hand, they outscored teams by 4.6 points per 100 possessions with James on the court and Irving on the bench).

Yet Irving’s track record shows that now is an optimal time to invest in him. He spent his earliest NBA years on one of the worst teams in the league and then played on a team built entirely around the strengths of James. Now that he’s won an NBA championship and learned from James, Irving has the potential to become a true, standalone superstar on the Celtics. Thomas’ noted transformation under the guidance of Celtics head coach Brad Stevens last season also bodes well for Irving, who will play alongside two All-Stars (Gordon Hayward and Al Horford), who can compensate for Irving’s lack of playmaking.

Overall, the trade benefits both teams. The Cavaliers got a three-player succession plan for their team-carrier, LeBron James. And the Celtics got a young star, poised to come into his own on the court. But how those players actually react to these opportunities, as with any trade, can only play out in real-time. And with both teams competing in the Eastern Conference, they’ll each bear witness to which team actually got the better end of the deal.",mainstream

Mr. Johnston, the CFO, predicts PepsiCo's products will ""come out on top"" as retailers winnow the nutritious brands to focus on top sellers. That is because PepsiCo is investing heavily in innovation and can scale up more easily through its highly developed agricultural procurement, says Mr. Johnston, who also expects profit margins of healthier offerings ultimately to be in line with the overall business.

PepsiCo hasn't been able to find a sugar substitute that will lower calories and wow consumers. Stevia, a zero-calorie natural sweetener, leaves a bitter aftertaste. When PepsiCo tried to fix Diet Pepsi last year by swapping aspartame for sucralose, another artificial sweetener, the sales plunge accelerated. This fall, the company reversed course and brought back Diet Pepsi with aspartame.

Mr. Khan says the company is getting better at combining sweeteners to replicate the taste of full-calorie versions. ""It's like cooking in your kitchen. It's not one ingredient,"" he says, adding PepsiCo has cut calories in many developed markets but that consumers in countries like China and India have been tougher to win over.

Absent a magic bullet, the company is chipping away at calorie counts in its beverages one by one, country by country, ingredient by ingredient. Mr. Khan says PepsiCo plans to expand distribution of reformulated 7UP and Mirinda sodas with 30% fewer calories to dozens of countries over the next 18 months.

PepsiCo has made more headway with sodium, cutting it by 12% per serving since 2006 after developing ""designer salt"" crystals shaped to deliver the same taste at lower concentrations. The company was among the first to remove trans fats from its snacks more than a decade ago, but it has cut saturated fat by 3% since 2006, versus its earlier goal of 15% by 2020. The company plans to roll out chips that are baked instead of fried in 25 more markets over the next 18 months.

It's a delicate balance. ""As long as we're delivering our [profit and revenue] guidance, I think we have the latitude to execute this transformation,"" says Mr. Johnston.

An array of new products at a trade show in Atlanta this fall told the story of two PepsiCos.

Anchoring one part of the display was a fiber-filled nut and fruit bar called Init and a sparkling lemonade with real lemon juice called Lemon Lemon.

Nearby sat an assemblage of bright bags of Mac N' Cheetos, new frozen cheese sticks resembling Cheetos, and Top N Go Doritos, a portable meal designed to be eaten with a fork and high in salt and fat.

Here is a company pulled in two different directions. Chief executive Indra Nooyi has vowed to turn the maker of Fritos, Cheetos, Lay's and Pepsi into a health juggernaut. But while consumers say they want to eat healthy, often what they really want is chips.

Despite an expanding stable of ""good for you"" brands like Quaker oatmeal, Naked juice and Sabra hummus, PepsiCo Inc. fell behind the goal it made in 2010 to triple revenue from nutritious products to $30 billion this decade. Its new 2025 goal, announced in October, is that sales growth of its nutritious products ""will outpace"" the rest of its portfolio.

Many launches have worked, but many, from True North nuts to midcalorie Pepsi Next to Müller Quaker yogurt, have fizzled. PepsiCo fell behind self-set targets of reducing the average amount of fat and sodium in key global brands by 2020. Sugars added in manufacturing have actually increased, instead of decreased as planned, in PepsiCo's products.

But buoyed by less-healthy snack brands such as Doritos chips and Cheetos puffs, PepsiCo's sales and volumes are on the rise and its profit margins have expanded in 15 quarters straight. Its stock price set a record high in July. Ms. Nooyi has revved up performance enough that earlier this year, Nelson Peltz, an activist shareholder who had dogged her for three years, congratulated her and walked away.

These are hard truths for big food companies. Taste is the biggest factor in a snack purchase, according to 66% of baby boomers and 53% of millennials in a March survey by consultancy Alix Partners. When people get together, ""they have snacks like potato chips and pretzels. They don't all sit around and snack on granola bars,"" says Norman Deschamps at market researcher Packaged Facts.

Natural and organic foods and beverages are growing fast -- 23% to $41 billion the past two years in the U.S. -- but are still a small slice of the country's $425 billion in overall sales, according to retail tracker Spins. Such products are often costlier to develop and harder to scale up. There were up to 50,000 products in a typical grocery store by 2013, up from 15,000 in 1991, but a quarter of them sold less than one unit a month, according to Accenture, a global consultancy.

It is a lot easier for a food behemoth like PepsiCo to generate revenue by tweaking just the Lay's brand of potato chips, the world's top-selling food brand, than to start from scratch with quinoa or spinach. Boosting Lay's global share of savory snacks by just a 10th of a percentage point translates into roughly $135 million of additional retail sales, based on Euromonitor International data. Almost two dozen PepsiCo brands earn at least $1 billion in annual retail sales.

The world's biggest food companies have been trying to ramp up healthier offerings for years, but consumers haven't given up their love for all things sweet and salty.

Nestlé SA, deep into a big push into healthier food, has warned it will miss its revenue growth target for a fourth straight year. A big reason behind recent woes at General Mills Inc. is weak Yoplait yogurt sales. Campbell Soup Co. blamed a recent sales downturn on execution problems at its fresh-food division after a poor carrot harvest and protein drinks recall.

""Everybody is looking for this transformation, and yet the big wheels of commerce don't support this transformation,"" says former PepsiCo President Zein Abdalla, a top deputy to Ms. Nooyi before retiring in 2014.

In October, PepsiCo set new sugar, sodium and fat reduction targets for 2025. It says nutritious products have risen to about 25% of revenue from 20% a few years ago.

Last month it paid slightly more than $200 million to acquire KeVita Inc., a maker of fermented probiotic drinks aimed at helping digestion and immunity. As halftime Super Bowl sponsor this February, PepsiCo is promoting Pepsi Zero Sugar, a diet cola. And it is introducing a version of Lay's barbecue chips with 50% less sodium.

Successful recent launches include Smartfood Delight, a reduced-fat popcorn; Quaker Real Medleys, portable instant oatmeal with fruit and nuts; and Mountain Dew Kickstart, a caffeinated juice drink with less than half the calories of regular soda.

""We're not trying. We're doing. We're succeeding,"" says Mehmood Khan, PepsiCo's chief scientific officer.

Global retail sales of Lay's, Doritos and Cheetos -- the world's three largest savory snack brands -- have averaged annual growth rates of 5%-plus the past five years, according to Euromonitor International. The company's Frito-Lay North America snacks unit, which also sells major chip brands like Ruffles and Tostitos, generated 52% of PepsiCo's operating profit last year, up from 43% in 2010.

Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston declined to compare growth rates or profit margins of PepsiCo's ""good for you"" products, which have positive nutrients like grains, fruits, vegetables and protein, with ""better for you"" products, low in sugar, salt and fat, or what it calls ""fun for you"" products such as Cheetos.

The goal isn't to turn PepsiCo into a health-food company, he says, but to provide consumers with choice. ""When consumers want to indulge, we have indulgent products,"" he says. ""When consumers want to eat healthy, we have healthy products.""

Nutritious products, Ms. Nooyi told Wall Street after taking the reins in 2006, represented one of PepsiCo's ""biggest growth opportunities,"" adding that the company saw ""health and wellness as one of those rare opportunities in business when the public good intersects with private interests."" The CEO, born and raised in India, has cast the push as an ethical imperative.

PepsiCo didn't make Ms. Nooyi available to be interviewed for this article.

Her timing seemed good. Global obesity and diabetes rates were rising and consumers had begun shunning soda and obsessively reading food labels.

She approached Switzerland's Nestlé about a potential merger but was rejected. Nestlé thought PepsiCo's dependence on chips and soda would hurt its own effort to become a company that sold healthier foods and beverages.

Ms. Nooyi ramped up R&D spending and dispatched executives to Iceland to research seaweed, India to study Ayurvedic medicine and Africa and the Amazon to learn about ancient grains, berries and plants.

She recruited Mr. Khan, a former Mayo Clinic endocrinologist and R&D chief at Takeda Pharmaceuticals, to employ basic science to solve some of food's thorniest problems -- including sugar, salt and fat, which are cheap ways to make products taste good but are unhealthy in large quantities.

All the change proved risky amid a tough global economy and rising commodity prices. Sales growth at the Frito-Lay North America unit slowed, and Pepsi lost market share to rival Coke.

Ms. Nooyi had to cut her profit outlook twice in 2011 and warned again in 2012. Investors accused her of ignoring brands that were ""bad for you"" but good for shareholders. The performance attracted Mr. Peltz, principal of Trian Fund Management LP, who dismissed the nutrition push as a ""distraction"" and accumulated stock in a campaign to split up PepsiCo.

PepsiCo was forced to recalibrate. In the spring of 2011, the cover of its annual report featured Lay's, Doritos, Pepsi and Mountain Dew, replacing more-nutritious brands that had been spotlighted in previous years. Ms. Nooyi stopped talking so much about healthy products as she increased marketing for the big core brands.

The pressure receded once PepsiCo began meeting and surpassing profit targets, says Mr. Johnston, the chief financial officer.

PepsiCo has continued to boost R&D spending, reaching $754 million in 2015, up from $344 million in 2006. The company also says about 9% of sales comes from innovation. It is unclear how much of that derives from items like fruit and fiber bars and how much from digital-age tweaks to traditional brands like Ruffles Ultimate, a potato chip with a deeper ridge and superior crunch produced by applying ""bending stress"" and ""blade tip geometry"" using 3-D printing technology.

Coming up with healthy new products can be slow and difficult going, according to many of the more than two dozen former PepsiCo R&D, sales and marketing executives interviewed for this article.

For starters, taste trumps everything. Sproutzels, a pretzel made from nutrient-rich sprouted whole grains, seemed like a good idea. The company tested it in Costco stores about 2 1/2 years ago but Costco dropped it after sales underwhelmed. A former PepsiCo manager who worked on the project described the taste as grassy, grainy and gritty. PepsiCo says Sam's Club currently stocks the product.

""I don't know too many consumers who compromise on taste for something that's more nutritious,"" says Gregory Yep, PepsiCo's senior vice president of long-term research before leaving the company last December.

PepsiCo's plants, meanwhile, are geared to churn out mass-volume products delivered directly to store shelves. One round-the-clock Frito-Lay plant in Irving, Texas, takes in 20 tons of potatoes every couple of hours; chips can be produced and sent out to stores in the same day. Quaker's nonstop mill in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the largest of its kind in the world, is serviced by 20 railcars carrying 100,000 bushels of raw oats a day.",mainstream
1003,"If, on a certain evening about sixty-­six million years ago, you had stood somewhere in North America and looked up at the sky, you would have soon made out what appeared to be a star. If you watched for an hour or two, the star would have seemed to grow in brightness, although it barely moved. That’s because it was not a star but an asteroid, and it was headed directly for Earth at about forty-five thousand miles an hour. Sixty hours later, the asteroid hit. The air in front was compressed and violently heated, and it blasted a hole through the atmosphere, generating a supersonic shock wave. The asteroid struck a shallow sea where the Yucatán peninsula is today. In that moment, the Cretaceous period ended and the Paleogene period began.",mainstream
779,"NEW YORK (Money Magazine) - From the Pilgrims to the Branch Davidians, America has long been a haven and spawning ground for disaffected clans seeking to start Utopian communities and achieve heaven on earth. The most fertile time for this phenomenon was the 1800s, when several factors -- lenient immigration laws, Manifest Destiny, the promise and excitement of a new nation -- converged to make America a magnet for groups like the Harmonists, whose village is among many Utopian sites that have been preserved as living museums, complete with guided tours. While touring a Utopian site is in some ways much like visiting any historical village -- here's the blacksmith shop, here's the general store and so on -- a Utopian tour has the added backdrop of the group's beliefs and lifestyle, which were usually, shall we say, a tad eccentric. Imagine Colonial Williamsburg populated by Trotskyite flat-earth worshipers, and you start to get the idea. I've always been intrigued by Utopian groups, and not just because Utopia is such an inherently seductive concept. Utopian leaders -- typically charismatic figures with messiah complexes, like George Rapp -- were usually fascinating head cases. And their civic frameworks, which tended to be communal, with members renouncing private property, were often grand social experiments. Let's begin with George Rapp and his Harmonists, nearly 800 of whom came to America in 1804. Some time around 1790 Rapp, a planter and self-proclaimed prophet, was stirring things up in Germany. He'd publicly rejected the Lutheran church -- a serious offense in Germany at that time -- and was preaching his own form of Christianity, prompting repeated conflicts with church and governmental officials. By 1800, Rapp and his followers, who called themselves Harmonists, had decided to leave Germany and establish a settlement where their religion could flourish. Happily for them, across the ocean was a new country where religious freedom had been codified into law: the United States of America. After two short-lived settlements, in 1824 they acquired 3,000 acres in what is now Ambridge, Pa., just northwest of Pittsburgh. This site, which they called Economy, was their home for over 80 years. Today a portion of it remains as Old Economy Village, a beautiful, six-acre collection of houses, workshops, gardens and exhibits. Rapp preached that Christ's Second Coming was imminent, so in 1807 the Harmonists adopted celibacy in order to purify themselves for the great day. Their notion of purification, however, didn't apply to alcohol, which they made for both their own consumption and outside sale. The massive underground wine cellar, featuring a vaulted ceiling and the original oak fermentation barrels, is among the most impressive sights at Old Economy. Moreover, the entire village is crawling with grapevines, just as in the 1800s -- not only in designated vineyards, but also on stone walls and the sides of buildings. It isn't exactly creepy -- after all, they're just grapes -- but something about it seems oddly askew, which is a good way to think of Utopian sites in general and of the Harmonists in particular. The Harmonists attracted occasional new followers over the years, but celibacy ultimately winnowed their ranks, and the last two living members dissolved the group in 1905. Celibacy has also taken a toll on the Shakers, probably America's best-known communal utopists. Founded in the late 1700s by the British visionary Mother Ann Lee, who believed she was the female incarnation of the Second Coming, the Shakers at one point had some 5,000 members living in 19 villages from New England to Kentucky (one of which, in Maine, is still active, although now with only a handful of adherents). Many of these sites have been preserved, most notably Hancock Shaker Village in Pittsfield, Mass., which was established in 1783 and active until 1960. Hancock is still a large, sophisticated site, with a working farm and 20 meeting halls, residences, workshops and other buildings, several of which -- particularly the 1826 circular stone barn -- are architectural gems. Knowledgeable employees explain Shaker life. I especially liked the kitchen demonstration, where a staffer made bread and pies in a wood-burning brick oven and fritters in a huge lard fryer. Mother Ann's dictum to ""Set your hands to work and give your hearts to God"" is evident everywhere -- not just in words but in the stoic, hard-toiling spirit of staffers, who show how to make the furniture and crafts for which the Shakers are best known. At some points, this virtuous lifestyle seems inspiring; at others -- such as when you learn that the Shakers enforced gender separation so strictly that men and women had separate entrances to their residences -- it seems rather grim. Either way, however, the Shaker story is an engrossing one, and it's easy to spend an entire day here. Although the Harmonists and Shakers were swimming against the actuarial tide, so to speak, not all Utopian groups were celibate. Quite the contrary, in fact, in the case of the Perfectionists, a 250-member group founded in 1848 by John Humphrey Noyes, a defrocked Vermont preacher. Noyes advocated ""complex marriage,"" in which each man was considered a husband to all the community's women, and each woman a wife to all its men -- in short, free love. Parent-child bonds and even close friendships were discouraged in favor of strict communalism, with children raised collectively by the entire group, and living arrangements periodically rotated to prevent any members from becoming too closely attached. Bizarre as this all might seem, the Perfectionists (so named because they believed the Second Coming had occurred in A.D. 70, making humans free from sin and thereby capable of achieving perfection) were a successful, functional community. They lived together for 32 years, primarily in a huge Victorian mansion in Oneida, N.Y. This building is now preserved as the Oneida Community Mansion House, where visitors can take guided tours and learn about other aspects of Perfectionist life, which included: tomboyish female clothing and hairstyles that were quite progressive for their time; a eugenics program that resulted in 58 selectively bred children; and a novel form of birth control, whose precise details are best left for your guide to explain (trust me). You can even stay the night in the mansion's comfortably refurbished rooms, though free love, alas, is not among the guest services offered. Like most Utopian communities, the Perfectionists supported themselves via assorted businesses, one of which was manufacturing silverware. When the community dissolved in 1880 -- in part because Noyes, fearing morals charges, had fled to Canada -- the silverware enterprise was incorporated as Oneida Ltd., which is still locally headquartered and has become a world-class brand. Along with Shaker furniture and Amana appliances, Oneida flatware is among the most visible and surprising examples of how these fringe groups have intersected with mainstream American life -- tangible remnants of heaven on earth. Zoar Village State Memorial -- Much like George Rapp's Harmonists, the Zoarites were breakaway German Lutherans. Helped by a loan from the Quakers, they acquired land in eastern Ohio in 1817 and lived there communally until 1898. Ten of their buildings, including homes, businesses and trade shops, are exhibited via guided tours, as is a massive garden with a biblically inspired design, planted in 1828. The Amana Colonies -- Founded by German Inspirationists in 1855, the seven communal Amana colonies gave birth to Amana Refrigeration, now a popular appliance brand. Many homes and businesses can be toured, but Amana may have become too successful for its own good--awash in Ye Olde Curio Shoppes and the like, it's now more redolent of hucksterism than of history. Koreshan State Historic Site -- Once home to 200 members, this site was founded in 1894 by Cyrus Teed, a New York physician who believed that the earth was hollow and that the rest of the cosmos existed inside of it -- a contention he and his group ""proved"" with homemade scientific instruments. Twelve buildings remain for public tours. Historic Rugby -- Not all Utopian sites were religiously inspired. This one, founded in 1880 by the British author Thomas Hughes, was designed to cultivate the civic and social potential of the second sons of prominent English families, who under Britain's gentry system received no title or wealth and were discouraged from learning a trade, leaving them ill-equipped for adult life. The experiment flopped, but several Victorian buildings remain, as does Hughes' impressive library, stocked with some 7,000 titles.",mainstream
774,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - If Scott Troetel is out with friends when the Indianapolis Colts are playing, he often reaches for his Blackberry to check how running back Joseph Addai is doing.

But Troetel, who is 32 and lives in Boulder, Colorado, is not particularly interested in the Colts. Addai’s performance is crucial to “Addai in the Life,” Troetel’s fantasy football team.

Fantasy sports, where fans select real athletes for make-believe teams, are exploding onto new platforms like smart phones and social networking sites, grabbing the attention of advertisers, wireless carriers and software companies.

And with a growing number of people playing casual games on the Internet and a largely untapped market outside the United States, analysts say the market for fantasy sports can only grow.

Among companies benefiting from this growth is 4Info, which alerts its users to things like sports scores and celebrity gossip via text message, with its revenue coming from advertisers.

Of the half a billion text messages that 4Info expects to send this year, as many as 15 percent will be to people seeking sports results to feed into their fantasy sports teams, said CEO Zaw Thet.

“People have yet to realize the full potential of fantasy as it really comes to the cell phone and we’ll see that over the course of the next several years,” said Thet, whose company is backed by Gannett Co, General Electric Co’s NBC Universal and venture capital firms.

While there is disagreement on the origin of fantasy sports, they came to wide attention with the publication of “Rotisserie League Baseball” in 1984, based on a league played by a group of New York media types and rules by magazine writer Daniel Okrent.

The appeal of fantasy leagues to sports fanatics is often cited as a factor in the early success of USA Today, which was launched in 1982 with more detailed baseball statistics than other newspapers.

“It’s like you’ve combined the old macho notion of knowing more than anybody about sports with Dungeons and Dragons,” said Robert Thompson, professor of pop culture at Syracuse University. “It turns out that’s a pretty good marriage.”

Troetel, for example, checks on his players at least two or three times a week, using his handheld device to go to the relevant websites. “The way I know sports now is far and away greater than if I didn’t play fantasy sports,” he said.

Fantasy sports took an exponential leap in the late 1990s as the Internet made sports results more widely available and sites like Yahoo Inc began to host fantasy sports leagues for a fee.

There are now more than 27 million players in the United States and annual revenue is in the range of $800 million to $1 billion, according to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association.

Fans already use their mobile phones to read sports news, review game scores and check on their teams. Wireless carriers are now working to align themselves exclusively with whatever sports properties they can as a way to make themselves more attractive to consumers.

“If you’re the only one who offers what people want, they’re going to find a way to switch to your service,” said Steve Gaffney, director of sports and entertainment marketing for Sprint Nextel Corp, which has deals with the National Football League and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR).

While small screens are not that attractive to advertisers, smart phones like Research in Motion’s Blackberry and Apple’s iPhone that offer live streaming video and other multimedia features is undeniable, said Bob Bowman, chief executive of Major League Baseball’s advanced media unit.

Another growth area is social networking sites like Facebook, which is hosting a fantasy football game with 350,000 users since it started in July, making it one of the larger fantasy football games on the Internet.

“Fantasy sports at its core is a set of microcommunities of your good friends that you want to stay in touch with and ‘talk smack’ to, and Facebook allows people to do that,” said Jeff Ma, co-founder of Citizen Sports Network, which runs the Facebook game in partnership with Time Warner’s Sports Illustrated.

Ma, whose San Francisco-based firm is backed by venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, is the basis for the main character in the book “Bringing Down the House” and the movie “21,” in which a group of students used math to win millions of dollars from casinos.

Another big growth area for fantasy sports is among so-called casual gamers, those whose interest is limited or who may not have a lot of free time to play.

ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co, in late August introduced a game where users try to select winners and top performers in an effort to be first to build a 25-pick winning streak over four months that would net a $1 million prize.

“It’s our strategy to develop games that are very easy to play,” said Raphael Poplock, vice president of games for ESPN Digital Media.

These casual players could help almost double the number of fantasy sports players to 50 million over the next five years, said Chris Russo, CEO of Fantasy Sports Ventures, a media company focused on fantasy sports.

Other companies taking advantage of the growth in fantasy sports include Google’s YouTube, Electronic Arts and advertisers like Gillette and Coke.

“The sheer participation numbers are so overwhelming,” said Andrew Bangs, a community marketing specialist with YouTube, which launched a fantasy football channel in July.

The growth in fantasy sports is also feeding back into the real sports leagues, where fantasy sports fans spend more time engaged with real teams than fans who don’t play fantasy sports.

“Nearly 60 percent of revenue comes from fans attending games, so to the extent I can get a casual fan to go to one game that means a lot,” baseball’s Bowman said. “If I can repeat that 10 million times, that’s real money.”

Overseas markets offer another enticing opportunity, as games around cricket, soccer, rugby and other sports are not as developed as those in the United States, said Steve Byrd, executive vice president with Stats Inc, which licenses sports content and statistics for almost 90 different sports leagues.

“You get the growing middle class in China and India, with Internet access, they’re going to want to engage with their sports the way that we do,” he said.

In addition, industry executives said the number of fantasy websites is exploding. That expansion will only speed up since the U.S. Supreme Court in June declined to hear the appeal by Major League Baseball of a lower-court ruling that any company has the free-speech right to use the names and performance statistics of famous athletes.

Of course with so many companies out there, there is bound to be a shakeout.

“One out of every 10 sites makes it,” said Rick Wolf, chairman of the Fantasy Sports Association. “For the small companies, it’s very hard to succeed.”

Not everyone is in favor of fantasy sports.

“I am the flat-earth society on this one,” said Dave Zirin, sports writer for The Nation, a left-wing magazine. “It’s a very atomizing experience to live in the United States at times and so sports is one of those few ways where we’re able to get a sense of collective joy. Fantasy sports runs counter to that.”

Allison Lodish just wants her husband back. She launched Women Against Fantasy Sports (http://womenagainstfantasysports.com) in August as a forum for frustrated spouses. The site’s top-selling item is women’s underwear with the slogan: “Closed for the fantasy season.”",mainstream
58,"To the casual observer, there is nothing remarkable about the crowd gathered in a convention room at a central Birmingham hotel. Middle managers on a staff team-building exercise, perhaps. But their conversations give them away. The clique in the corner discussing the moon landings. The man at the bar chastising an acquaintance for holding on to the science he was taught at school. The woman who asks another, “If they’ve lied about this, what else are they lying about?” The various conversations peter out as the open-mic session gets under way. A 40-something woman approaches the stage. “My name’s Sarah,” she says. “And I’m a Flat Earther.” Other audience members offer similar anecdotes: epiphanies, followed by a complete rebuttal of their previous beliefs. Few are able to explain why a conspiracy might exist, why scientists might go to such great lengths to create false evidence.

I’m in central Birmingham, at the UK’s first Flat Earth convention, a weekend of lectures and workshops designed to provide believers with opportunities to engage with others who subscribe to the same hypothesis: that the Earth is not a globe, as most of us think, but some kind of plane, with edges. Around 200 people have paid to attend.

I’d arrived an hour earlier and found a chair six or seven rows back from the stage. Behind me, two men in their 20s are scrolling through images of the Earth taken from space. Every once in a while they land on a photograph that piques their interest, enter into a brief discussion, and move on. A middle-aged man a couple of seats away leans in to ask the pair what they are doing.

“Looking for the Photoshopped images,” they say.

Around the room, there is general consensus that Nasa is in the habit of doctoring its imagery, and the agency is considered untrustworthy. For long-standing Flat Earthers, the information is old-hat. They’ve used Nasa as the punchline of acerbic jokes for years and have rejected their discoveries as elitist artifice, part of a cover-up. But the young men have yet to fully commit to the community. They are sceptical, still, of its members’ hypotheses, though they’ve bought tickets to the convention and arrived with open minds. If a speaker can offer evidence that challenges conventional science, they say, they’d happily let go of their deep-seated beliefs. But that isn’t going to stop them from searching for proof of their own.

Soon, the three of them are deep in conversation. The older man introduces his take on the Nasa cover-up. That the colour of the ocean in one image is different to the colour of the ocean in another; that in two pictures the continents seem to be in the same position, but in a third they appear to have shifted. The images are riddled with discrepancies, he says. “They’re all different!”

I first discovered the Flat Earth community last year, when the cricketer Andrew Flintoff came out publicly in support of the movement’s theories. Flintoff’s announcement led me to a YouTube video, and then another, and another after that. In each, a presenter denounced conventional science as flawed, if not entirely fabricated, and offered alternative hypotheses. Many of the presenters are speakers at the convention: Dave Murphy (29,000 subscribers), Martin Liedtke (800+ videos), Nathan Oakley (1.5m views). Most of the convention’s guests have come to the Flat Earth movement in a similar way: through videos, first, and later comment threads and forum discussions. When the community was still very young, around 2013, theories spread quickly, though only between outlying networks of conspiracy theorists. Now hypotheses appear weekly, released across hundreds of online channels. Many come from the US, where the scene simmers not far below the mainstream. Conventions are popping up throughout North America. In August, believers will travel to Edmonton, Canada. In November they’ll meet in Denver, Colorado. Conference organisers are planning the world’s first Flat Earth cruise. It will set sail some time in 2019.



The American community is big and brash and filled with personalities vying for public influence. There, Flat Earthers have secured airtime on almost every major television network, sometimes primetime slots, and the movement has been lent credibility by celebrity support. (The rapper BoB is a believer.) But, because Flat Earth has been a YouTube phenomenon, the same hypotheses tend to appear everywhere: that the Earth is flat and round, like a pancake. That it is surrounded on all sides by the Antarctic, a huge impassable wall of ice, and protected by a dome. That it is not hurtling through space at great speed but rooted somehow, an immovable mass: still, calm, glorious, the epicentre of the universe.

This is contrary to thousands of years of science, of course. Aristotle claimed the world was a sphere some time around 350BC. Plato agreed. So did Pythagoras, Archimedes and later, in 240BC, the astronomer Eratosthenes, who was among the first to estimate the Earth’s circumference. It was confirmed in the 1500s when a Spanish expedition led by Magellan circumnavigated the globe. Most of us have believed ever since, though not all, apparently.

Those at the beginning of their Flat Earth journey typically encounter hundreds of ideas – some alike, some wildly contradictory – in a very short space of time. Nearly always the research period ends in what believers refer to as a kind of awakening, a moment when the information they’ve consumed coalesces, and they achieve insight the rest of us aren’t able to grasp. Sometimes that takes three months. For many it takes at least six. A woman at the convention tells me she has so far logged 8,000 hours of research, though others consider that extreme.

Often research is conducted alone, at a computer screen. The convention is meant to remedy this. “It’s really nice to be in a room with open-minded people,” one man tells me while we are queuing for coffee during a break in the lectures. The comment has multiple meanings. Many in the audience have only ever experienced the community online. (The speakers, who walk around the hotel with an air of minor celebrity, are regularly referred to by their YouTube handles.) Every now and then a group might meet informally in a pub, but often the turn-out is tiny. When, on the opening night, a speaker asks members of the audience to raise a hand if this is the first time they’ve met another Flat Earther, many do.

But the comment hides darker sentiment, too. Coming out in opposition to conventional science can be fraught. I hear stories of family bust-ups, of partners never speaking to each other again. “I don’t enjoy being a Flat Earther,” one speaker says. “People ridicule you.” Another woman tells me, “My friends, they thought I was crazy.” Believers hide their views from loved ones, fearful of potential repercussions: the blank stares, the angry retorts. It isn’t just “really nice” to be in a room with open-minded people, it is far less emotionally taxing.

During a break between lectures, I find Sarah, the woman from the open mic, and ask her how it felt to uncover the theories. “I was just like…” She throws her hands above her head in a mimicry of sudden shock. “Mind. Blown.” Later, she adds, “You kind of discover that everything you’ve ever known is incorrect.”

Most of the audience members watch the lectures enthralled. In one, Dave Marsh, who works for the NHS, posits that the moon is a projection. In another, Darren Nesbit, a part-time musician who drives a van for a living, suggests the Earth is diamond-shaped, not circular, and supported by colossal columns. (Walk off one edge, he says, and through a quirk of space and time you’ll appear on the other side.) Martin Liedtke presents theories with the frenzy of a child high on sugar. Watching him is fun and exciting – and utterly baffling. He offers several hypotheses – that the Earth is one of several ponds carved out of a huge crust of ice, for example – before walking off stage to almighty applause.

After Liedtke’s lecture, I find Nesbit outside, and ask him what he thought of the talk. “I was like that at first,” he says. “It’s such an amazing realisation that you want to tell the whole world. But what you don’t realise is the world isn’t ready to hear it.”



I’d spoken to Nesbit a few times previously, and I’d come to like him. While others railed headstrong against scientific convention, he advocated a measured approach to fact-finding. Search for the truth for yourself. Question things. Don’t believe everything you read. Who knows what you might find?

In an era of disinformation the message feels particularly pertinent. “Science isn’t perfect,” Chris French, a professor of psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London, tells me when we speak on the phone after the conference. “And in one sense it’s good that people question authority. You need that in a healthy democracy. But you also have to have the critical thinking skills to be able to evaluate the evidence.”

At a buffet lunch on the Saturday, between instalments of a three-hour talk by a speaker who’d flown in from Argentina, I meet a 24-year-old computer science graduate called Kai. I’d noticed him the night before. He’d spoken at the open mic, but whereas many of the other guests had been upbeat, almost jubilant, his delivery had seemed laced with sadness. “I remember last year,” he said at one point. “I was so frustrated with life.”

At the buffet, I ask Kai why. “I think a big part of it is to do with lies we’re being told,” he says. “And not being in control of your own life.”

Others I speak to echo the sentiment: that the course of their lives had escaped their command, and they felt powerless to it. When I ask them to explain what their lives were like when they experienced their awakening, several describe a kind of personal crisis.

Dave Murphy, the closest thing the convention has to a superstar speaker, came to the movement after his marriage unravelled. Didi Vanh, one of the organisers, tells me she’d been “bored and frustrated with life”, and decided to research theories online. She’d been approaching 30, and thought: “What else is there?” (The Flat Earth, she says, had made her “a better person”.) Sarah had been through a hellish break-up. In those situations, she says: “I think you open up more, you crack open, and then other things present themselves.”

I bring this up with Chris French. He tells me it made sense “that some kind of psychological crisis had led these people to dramatic insight”. Conspiracy theorists are united in their rejection of conventional views and often the rejection is both a bid to reclaim personal agency and an attempt to experience community.

“It’s almost like a coping mechanism,” Rebecca Owens, lecturer in psychology at the University of Sunderland, tells me. “The belief that: ‘Actually, I have some control over this’. They’ve had this revelation and now something makes sense – while everything else in their world is chaotic.”

According to psychologists, conspiracy theorists often feel they’re somehow special: whereas the majority of the population has fallen for a false rhetoric, a conspiracy theorist has risen above it. “They have this special knowledge, this special insight,” French tells me. When the community comes together, views are mutually reinforced, and the world becomes explainable, if not entirely secure.

Isn’t that dangerous? “Believing in the Flat Earth theory isn’t really dangerous in itself,” says Mike Marshall of the Good Thinking Society, a pro-science organisation, after the convention. “But Flat Earthers tend to believe in other conspiracy theories, too.” He means the “anti-vaxxer” movement, particularly, whose subscribers reject conventional medicine as false or unnecessary, sometimes with disastrous consequences and most often to the detriment of children. This “special insight” that French talks about, is a denial of the expert view, of years of scientific progression: the world was created divinely, evolution is nonsense, vaccinations are harmful, news is fake.

“And the thing about conspiracy beliefs is that they’re kind of non-falsifiable. There’s no piece of evidence that could convince someone they’re wrong, because any evidence that does suggest they’re wrong has obviously been put there by the conspirators. In the case of the Flat Earth, that would be the scientific community.”

Towards the end of the day I walk past Kai in a corridor. Much of the audience has left, but Kai is still hunting truths. Earlier he’d told me he’d yet to fully commit to the Flat Earth movement. He’d been researching various conspiracies, and he’d yet to arrange the information he’d found into order. Now I ask if he’d been convinced.

He shakes his head and lets out big sigh. Then he says: “I’d prefer to keep my options open.”",mainstream
1268,"“Community – How to live together? How to communicate effectively?

Who knows how we’ve experienced a sense of community in other dimensions, once upon a long time ago? We may all live with a cellular/DNA – memory of unity and oneness from an existence before the start of the veiling process. A memory in and of Awakening.

It seems that now, after living with a “horizontal” consciousness expansion, limited by the concept of material expansion on a planet seemingly existing as a self-contained life form, first as a flat Earth, than as a globe and centre of “the Universe” (yet unseen) after Galilei’s exclamation “And yet she’s round!”

As a celestial body circling around the Sun, with other space-bodies forming the Solar System as yet another part of the entire Galaxy, in our technologically more advanced time, observed through the eyes of cameras, we’re all touched and affected by a storm of change that is in progress at a 90 degree angle: a “vertical” consciousness expansion in much tumult, clanging and banging, much topsy turvy.

I choose a direction North-South for ease of understanding dimensional shifts in sync with the term “Ascension” which means to many religious people “rising up to the heavens” with images illustrating a figure carried on the weightless substance of clouds.

When rising above the quirkiness of personal styles in approach and awake and alert to the vagueness of presence and intention (in virtual communications) we can step forward and connect by addressing the issues that are rising within us, communicating our feelings and the experience of how actions of others affect us and how we feel our own actions affect others. By being informed about their impact on others who make an effort to offer feedback, honouring their own value as much as the value of the person on the other side of the screen, or table.

The desire that one’s presence matters in a community, can lead to different expressions, depending on a force of will, making a point for the sake of fanatism, a need for attention or competition, by challenging an authority, or a warm-hearted service as a means to fulfilment of one’s own desire in sync with one’s desire to serve a general sense of wellbeing in all.

Issues that are rising between 2 people, showing up in their one-on-one communication online, or in the practice of working together in the physical world, should best be kept in that close encounter of a duet. It takes two to tango and not one or more than 2, for isn’t stepping on each other’s toes sufficient pain to pay attention properly?

To me, it’s an interesting subject to discuss community-creation and without expecting you or others here to address all of them, here are a couple of questions:

– How does it look like, your favoured community? How would you describe your life in it?

 – What makes or breaks a community?

 – What’s the difference in a virtual and physical community? If there’s one at all.

 – What’s causing members of a community to feel inspired and at ease?

 – What’s required to maintain a community in liveliness and sparkly vibes, open to change?

 – Should there be an intention and foundation on which a community is built and functioning?

 – Should a community-to-be start with a gathering of people at random, spontaneously/casually formed?

 – Is a community a work in progress, with a common interest showing up in due time, which my become the core of an intentional community?

 – Should a community grow organically, by a coming and going of members without a fixed plan for an “end-product” or “end-result?”

 – Are members of a community open to leaving and trying out different forms of communities?

 – Should a community be a living organism that is in motion and change always.

Moving around freely nd explore different forms of community is a great learning curve in my perception. When a genuine attempt is made to study, attune and learn. Use of discernment can be trained due to a variety of experiences and encounters with people of all walks of life and even ET-races. In the latter case communication becomes a whole new concept, I imagine.

To me, the form and subject of a chosen service are two very different things.

– Is transparency of decision making and reports of financial manoeuvers to all members of a community, who contribute financially, a must and a benefit?

There are questions about community living “How to live together?” that countless human generations have pondered and discussed, forgotten, buried and dug up, dusted off and, at times, placed on an altar. The following statement I hold close to my heart:

“Once upon a time in the civilized world the monarch and the public servants who honoured their oath of allegiance, delivered to the people freedom, justice, leisure and instruction by facilitating instruction and apprenticeship. The city-state encouraged each individual to develop special skills appropriate to the ascribed natural or genetic abilities of that individual, to meet the many needs of the wider community, the pursuit of excellence in each department was a matter of honour where self-interest led to a duty of care towards fellow citizens and the overall success of that community” Edmund Marriage 2004

989,"Michael ""Marsh"" Marshall (born 13 August 1983) is a British skeptical activist, freelance journalist, public speaker, podcaster, author and blogger. He is co-founder and vice-president of the Merseyside Skeptics Society and co-host of its official podcast Skeptics with a K,[1] project director of the Good Thinking Society,[2] and has occasionally written for The Times, The Guardian and New Statesman.[1]

Michael Marshall was born on 13 August 1983 in Bishop Auckland, North East England. He obtained a BA in English in Liverpool, and has worked there in marketing and web design since.[4]

In February 2009, Marshall, Mike Hall and Colin Harris founded the Merseyside Skeptics Society.[4] He commented that skepticism is ""not about just saying 'no' to things, it's about thinking about them. And we use the American spelling – skeptic – because, in the States, the word isn't as strongly linked to cynicism. It's not seen as being as negative as it is over here.""[6] In July that year, they launched the podcast Skeptics with a K,[7] which Marshall described as ""a fairly-shambolic, overly-enthusiastic and snarky mix of science, skepticism and sarcasm.""[4] The idea for SwaK came from the conversations Hall and Marsh were having in the pub about news and ideas, such as a homoeopathy overdose,[8] that they wanted to share with a wider audience.[9]

In January 2010, Marshall coordinated the 10:23 Campaign to stage a mass overdose of homoeopathy outside branches of Boots UK in several major cities throughout the country, to publicly demonstrate the inefficacy of homoeopathic products and protest against their sale.[10][11] In February 2011, he also coordinated the global 10:23 Campaign, during which protesters on all continents in 70 cities (at least 30 participants per city) overdosed on homoeopathy.[12][13][14] He himself led the overdose on 5 February 2011 at 10:23 during QED 2011,[15] the first annual skeptical conference in Manchester co-organised by the Merseyside Skeptics Society and the Greater Manchester Skeptics Society. In November 2019, Marshall was in Brazil to officially launch the campaign that aims to withdraw financial aid for homeopathy by the country's public health system (SUS).

In October 2011, the Merseyside Skeptics Society (represented by Hall and Marshall), Chris French and Simon Singh set up a ""Halloween Challenge"" to Sally Morgan to have her alleged psychic abilities tested, to demonstrate that her claims regarding talking to the dead are true, otherwise she might, knowingly or unknowingly, be taking advantage of people's grief.[16] Morgan did not turn up at the press conference, but threatened to sue the skeptics for defamation through her lawyers instead.[17] Nevertheless, the MSS decided to make the Halloween Challenge an annual event and invited any psychic in the UK to take part.[18] When two psychics failed an experiment in October 2012, Marshall remarked: ""While the result of our experiment doesn't disprove psychic ability, the fact that our mediums couldn't pass what they felt was a very fair and simple test does seem to suggest claims that these abilities exist aren't based in reality.""[19] At the Australian Skeptics National Convention 2014 in Sydney, Marsh lectured about pseudoscience and the channelling of spirits.[20]

In January 2013, Marshall and Hayley Stephens started a podcast called 'Be Reasonable', where Marshall interviewed people with beliefs outside of the mainstream of acceptable science. The aim was to try and understand why people believe in these things without criticising or mocking the person being interviewed. He has stated that. ""...I try to avoid as much as possible talking over the details of factual claims, where I can’t tell in the moment whether a fact is valid or misrepresented, but instead I try to look at the logic built around that particular fact"".[21] Episodes of the show include interviews with Flat Earther, Mark Sargeant; Vicki Monroe, a Psychic and cold case investigator; and Jim Humble, a proponent of Miracle Mineral Supplement solution.[22]

On SwaK Marshall developed a skill for spotting bad public relations (PR) in the news. This led to holding public lectures about the subject at Skeptics in the Pub meetings throughout the UK, including in Liverpool,[23] and Glasgow,[24] and at skeptical conferences including the 2013 European Skeptics Congress in Stockholm,[25] and at Skeptics on the Fringe 2014.[26] His main contention is that in recent decades, journalists have become increasingly under pressure to write more articles in less time, limiting their time for investigate research and instead tempting or forcing them to pick up press releases from PR companies and, often with little editing, passing them off as real news stories to meet their quota (churnalism). Such press releases are more often than not simply veiled advertisements, disguised as scientific studies or representative social surveys which, if based on any sort of inquiry at all, are usually poorly set up or conducted and prone to bias. Moreover, the headlines under which these ""results"" get published can be sensationalised and thus even more misleading, and if readers believe such ""news"" stories to be true, it may have serious negative effects on people's views and actions.[25] When education secretary Michael Gove was criticised by many mainstream newspapers for mistaking a PR stunt by OnePoll for hotel chain Premier Inn, for genuine research on schoolchildren's allegedly lamentable knowledge of British history, Marshall called this ""ironic"", and rebuked the newspapers by showing how they themselves are largely relying on the same kind of agencies' press releases with ""dodgy surveys"" for their news stories.[27]

He has also done an interview on BBC Radio 4's More or Less programme, where he discusses various newspaper articles and big headlines that are based on bad PR.[28]

In recent years, Marshall is reporting on the modern flat Earth societies and individuals, who promote the erroneous idea that the Earth is flat rather than a sphere, in order to understand the root of rejecting such uncontroversial facts.[29] Marshall attended the UK’s annual Flat Earth UK Convention between 27-29, April 2018 and noted that believers in a flat Earth vary widely in their views. While most agree upon a disc-shaped Earth, some are convinced the Earth is diamond shaped. Furthermore, while most believers do not believe in outer space and none believe mankind has ever traveled there, they vary widely in their views of the universe.[30] To Marshall, one of the most telling moments at the convention was the “Flat Earth Addiction” test that was based on a checklist used to determine whether someone is in a cult, without the convention attendees realizing the possibility of themselves being in a cult.[30] Furthermore, Marshall points out that while the belief in a flat Earth might rightly be labelled ridiculous, it is perhaps important to approach believers in a flat Earth as much with understanding as ridicule. Namely, as Marshall states, “it is striking how many people who doubt the global model of the Earth also subscribe to all manner of other beliefs, from Biblical literalism to occultist paranoia, from anti-vaccination to quack cancer cues, from antisemitism to Aryanism. But it is also just as striking how many people whose journey into believing the Earth is flat included traumatic events or personal crises”.[29] During QED 2018 Marshall presented his findings from the Flat Earth Convention to the skeptic community, during an interview with Alex Moshakis, of The Observer, before the talk he said ""his intention was not to pillory Flat Earth beliefs, but to explain what might turn a person against conventional science, and how their beliefs can become contagious."" [31]

Since March 2014, Marshall has been project director at the Good Thinking Society (GTS).[32] His major focus has been ending the funding of homoeopathy by the National Health Service (NHS), which the GTS considers a costly waste of public money on demonstrably ineffective products;[33] he lectured about this at QED 2015 in Manchester.[34] In June 2015, the Daily Mirror reported that Marshall had investigated the curious case of Freeman's, a NHS-supplying pharmacy that, amongst other products, sold ""homeopathic owl"", apparently meant for people with sleeping problems or who ""pick up the characteristics of [an owl]"". Marshall commented that ""Around £3–5 million is spent each year [on homeopathic products by the NHS] and it's completely worthless. People are being told that it works when there's no evidence that it does.""[35] Also in June, he and GTS founder Simon Singh called on all remaining homoeopathy-funding CCGs in the UK to follow the example of Liverpool to reconsider their funding policies.[36]

In May 2014, Marshall accused writers at The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail of 'poor journalism' for uncritically picking up press releases from the British Chiropractic Association and the United Chiropractic Association, based on 'flimsy studies' and assertions that were 'certainly not supported by any reliable evidence'. Recalling the British Chiropractic Association v Singh case, he concluded: ""If chiropractors want to be taken seriously, perhaps they should focus on improving the regulation of their industry and conducting rigorous research rather than relying on PR stunts to drum up business.""[37][38]

In May 2015, GTS obtained video footage from the Spirit of Health Congress, where, according to Marshall, claims were made about health that 'appeared illegal and could cause serious harm': ""The dangerous misinformation at the Spirit of Health event is shocking, particularly with regard to serious conditions such as cancer.""[39]

In September 2015, Marshall showed how American televangelist and self-proclaimed prophet and faith healer Peter Popoff –previously exposed by James Randi– was trying to persuade people to send him money on promises of ""fabulous extreme fortune"" and ""miracles"". Moreover, at a recent London gathering, GTS filmed how Popoff supposedly 'healed' a woman 'who said her body was wracked with pain', but who Marshall and his colleague believed could have been planted in the audience as part of Popoff's team: they saw she was handing out pens and a questionnaire at the start of the event, and quietly left the room soon after the alleged miracle.[40]

In November, 2017, the British Homeopathic Association (BHA) filed suit to overturn NHS England’s new guidance which advises GP’s not to prescribe homeopathic remedies. In June, 2018, BHA lost that case, in a decision characterized by Dr. Edzard Ernst as the result of ""4 years of excellent work by the GOOD THINKING SOCIETY"".[41] Marshall noted that “The last few years have seen almost every part of the NHS end support for homeopathy, and this court decision only goes to further underline the fact that homeopathy warrants no place in modern healthcare.”[42]

667,"This is Brexit anniversary week. Two years ago on June 23, 2016, a small majority of British voters decided to leave the EU and thereby inflict upon their country the most spectacular act of self-harm since the Suez crisis, as historically minded Remainers are wont to point out. The prime minister who oversaw the referendum has since been consigned to history himself: David Cameron went, Theresa May came in. She inherited the so-called will of the people and assured everyone that ""Brexit means Brexit.""

But, so far, she has yet to expand on that initial definition. May contrived to almost lose an unnecessary snap election intended to strengthen her hand and is still caught in an endless loop of false starts and denials. Her Cabinet is split between Brexiteers and Remainers, a sure recipe for a sustained lack of progress. Brexit Minister David Davis is reported to have had all of two meetings with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier since Christmas. Davis is not a details man and seems bored by the intransigence of the bloc on regulations and contracts.

All we have as of today is the outline of a divorce settlement that is now stuck behind the impasse of the Irish border question. Either condemn the Irish to live with a border between the Republic and Northern Ireland or accept a border running though the Irish sea or accept something like the Norwegian model and enter the European Economic Area. All of which May and the Brexiteers deem unacceptable.

For months on end now, May has let her cabinet play with two solutions for a future customs agreement, neither of which the EU thinks acceptable. A Brexit White Paper will only be published in July, conveniently after the EU summit in Brussels and in the midst of the summer vacation. Anyone expecting any viable solutions may be sorely disappointed.

The whole process is a game of smoke and mirrors. Some attest Theresa May with a clever strategy. Others say it is simply chaos reigning. Only eight months till Brexit day and Britain does not know how food will be imported, medicines will reach hospitals, factories will receive the necessary materials. ""The clock is ticking,"" Michel Barnier likes to repeat.

The most devastating headline of all appeared in the usually harmless Metro. Thousands of Londoners pick up in the free paper in the mornings at their local stations. ""Magic Money Theresa"" screamed the front page. That hit home because during her election campaign last year, May had proven particularly tone deaf to the plight of voters. When a nurse complained about her low salary, Theresa answered: ""I don't have a magic money tree."" But one seems to have grown in her garden now.

Just this weekend, May promised GBP 20 billion ($26.3 billion, €22.8 billion) additional funding for the ailing National Health Service (NHS). And she suggested that part of that money could come from the so-called Brexit dividend. That is truly magic money. Because countless economists and the official Institute for Fiscal Studies in London have definitively stated: ""There is no Brexit dividend.""

Whatever Britain might save in EU contributions in later years will be swallowed by increased border controls, falling growth, production slow-downs and so on. Even the the conservative Times ran with an editorial saying that the statement about the Brexit dividend was ""as mendacious as the lie on the big red bus.""

The money for the health system will simply come from a tax rise. But that is unspectacular and rather bad propaganda.

Broken promises usually come back to haunt you, as the prime minister discovered at great cost. Last week, she only managed to avert a defeat in parliament, because she promised the Brexit-rebels in her party a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal. That secured their last-minute loyalty and they towed the government line. A day later, however, May could not remember what she had promised. Or had the rebels totally misunderstood her? The prime minister simply denied everything.

The rebels were furious because they felt duped. And they managed to get their revenge with a little help from the Lords in the upper house. They again added a clause to the EU-Exit law, which would give parliament the final say on the Brexit deal or no deal. Lawmakers should not be in a position to tie the hands of government, the PM asserted. The Brexit rebels argue that it cannot be trusted to do the right thing for Britain because of sectarian warfare amongst the Tories.

Jacob Rees-Mogg is the leading Brexiteer and a constant thorn in Theresa May's side. He is also being talked up as her possible successor. At the same time, he seems to have been outed as a blazing hypocrite as a man who does not let his politics interfere with his money making. The MP earned his fortune on the financial markets, even though he cultivates the image of the 18th century landed gentry. Now it was revealed that one of the city firms that he has helped set up has established an investment fund in Ireland.

""Somerset Capital Investment"" fears for the earnings of future clients and explicitly cites Brexit as a cause for concern. It is the honorable Rees- Mogg however, who fosters that particular risk with a vengeance. As the front man of the ""European Research Group"" he stands for the cleanest possible break with the EU. Why does Britain need a customs arrangement with the EU at all? We can go it alone, is his credo.

But preaching this and placing your money where your mouth is, are two different things. The new SCI fund in Dublin states in its prospectus: ""During, and possibly after (Brexit) there is likely to be considerable uncertainty as to the position of the UK and the arrangements which will apply to its relationship with the EU and other countries after its withdrawal."" That sums things up pretty well one year after the start of talks. The fund also warns its clients about the consequences of a hard Brexit, which would ""increase costs"" and make it difficult to achieve its objectives (i.e. earn money).

But Jacob Rees-Mogg fended off all accusations of hypocrisy. The language was just legalese and setting up the fund had ""nothing whatsoever” to do with Brexit. When in his career has the Moggster lost the capacity to blush?

Most of the online comments upon publication of this story are not fit to print being too heavy on four-letter words. ""Odious” is one of the few quotable attributes.

699,"This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.

WASHINGTON — Drew Caputo was sitting on the couch at his home in the Bay Area watching the election returns on November 8th, 2016. As soon as it became apparent Trump was going to win, Caputo, a senior lawyer with the group Earthjustice, had two immediate thoughts: The first was that a Trump administration would be nothing short of a disaster for the environment, climate, and public health.

The second thought, he says, was: “Time to go to work. Time to go to the mattresses.”

Caputo and his colleagues quickly identified several critical issues that Trump might go after and formed internal teams to prepare for the worst. One potential disaster, he and his colleagues envisioned, was the undoing of the Obama administration’s efforts to protect parts of the Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans from oil and gas exploration. Even before Trump was sworn in, lawyers at Earthjustice had started lining up potential plaintiffs and honing their arguments to block a fossil-fuel free-for-all in the fragile ocean waters. “We knew the Trump guys would be an environmental wrecking crew and we wanted to be in a position to respond immediately,” Caputo says.

Sure enough, in April 2017, Trump signed an executive order to throw open the Arctic and parts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for oil exploration. Within a week, Earthjustice and a coalition of groups including the League of Conservation Voters, Sierra Club, and Natural Resources Defense Council sued Trump to block the order.

Almost two years later, a federal judge struck down a key section of Trump’s executive order, calling it “unlawful and invalid.” The Obama-era protections would “remain in full force and effect unless and until revoked by Congress.”

Caputo was visiting colleagues in Juneau, Alaska, not long afterward when a breaking news story lit up their phones. David Bernhardt, Trump’s new Secretary of the Interior, had told the Wall Street Journal that he was shelving the agency’s plan to expand offshore drilling. The administration had appealed the court’s decision, but Bernhardt said he wouldn’t push ahead on a new drilling plan until the legal fight played out, a process that could take years. “By the time the court rules, that may be discombobulating to our plan,” Bernhardt said.

Caputo and his colleagues traded high-fives. The ocean waters in question were safe from new oil and gas exploration — at least for now. To top it off, the Interior secretary himself had admitted that the litigation brought by Earthjustice and its allies had foiled his plans.

“I said, ‘We’re the discombobulators,’” Caputo says.

THINK BACK to early 2017. One of the biggest fears about a Trump presidency was the damage he would inflict on the environment and the climate. And we were right to be afraid. The administration has unleashed an onslaught of attacks on environmental safeguards — reversing or freezing regulations, making public lands and protected waters available for extraction, and doling out tax breaks and policy tweaks to cronies in the oil, gas, and coal sectors. At a moment when the U.S. needed to take drastic action to combat the global climate crisis, Trump and his industry-loving underlings like EPA chief Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke were poised to take us back in time and risk the future of the planet.

Trump and company have had some notable successes, but two and a half years in, they have failed a lot more than they have succeeded. Waiting for them at every turn has been a network of lawyers who work for the nation’s leading environmental groups. These lawyers have sued the administration at a breathtaking clip. And in the cases that have been decided, they’ve won almost every time. It’s a David-and-Goliath story that doesn’t dominate the headlines or send the Twittersphere into frenzy. But measured in lives saved and planet-wrecking policies thwarted, it’s one of the most consequential stories of the Trump era.

Consider the raw numbers: Since Trump took office, the Natural Resources Defense Council has sued the administration — including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commerce and Interior and Energy departments, and yes the president himself —more than 90 times. That’s one lawsuit every 10.8 days. Of the 53 cases that have been resolved, NRDC has won 49 of them. That’s a 92 percent win rate.

Earthjustice, for its part, sued the administration 120 times in the first two years of the Trump presidency. In the 17 cases where there’s been a major decision, Earthjustice has won 16 times and the administration just once.

These victories include forcing the EPA to implement new smog standards that will prevent an estimated 230,000 asthma attacks per year, delaying the construction of the Keystone XL tar-sands pipeline, restoring federal protections for grizzly bears living in or near Yellowstone National Park, and preventing the EPA from scrapping a chemical-safety rule that would protect up to 117 million Americans.

It’s not uncommon for multiple environmental and public-health groups to bring cases together alongside state attorneys general, and lawyers for these groups stress how much of their success was due to the unprecedented amount of collaboration across the environmental movement. “We’re more coordinated and better coordinated because there’s just so much more going on,” says Aaron Colangelo, the co-director of litigation at NRDC.

Rolling Stone spoke with half a dozen lawyers on the front lines of the fight against the Trump administration’s war on the environment. All of them say they knew from the moment Trump was elected that they would have to prepare for an administration hell-bent on dismantling the progress of the Obama years and handing the keys of government over to private interests. “We knew that it was all vulnerable,” Colangelo says. “I don’t think we anticipated that it would be as bad as it has been. We sued Obama. We sued Clinton. We sued Bush. But it’s never been anything like this.”

IT DIDN’T take long for environmental lawyers to pick up on the Trump administration’s strategy. From day one, there was a complete, extreme, across-the-board bias against regulations. Regulation? Bad. Coupled with that was a knee-jerk reflex to try to undo the previous president’s work. Obama? Bad. This was hammered home by the so-called Priebus memo, a directive issued by Trump’s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, on the first day of the new administration. It ordered a government-wide freeze on new regulations. Even rules that Obama had signed and were on their way to the printers were frozen until further notice.

One of those was the mercury effluent rule. Five tons of mercury was going into the nation’s rivers each year for the simple reason that dentists removed fillings from their patients and flushed them down the sink without any way of catching the fillings’ mercury. Dangerous levels of the toxin ended up in rivers and in fish, endangering pregnant mothers who ingested the fish, putting their unborn children at an increased risk of learning disabilities, lower IQ, and impaired fine motor skills.

In its final days, the Obama administration passed a rule that required dentists to use a trap to catch the mercury. The environmental groups supported it, as did the main lobbying group for dentists. But because the mercury effluent rule hadn’t been published in the Federal Register yet, the Priebus memo blocked it from going into effect.

NRDC sued over the reversal in one of the earliest cases brought against the Trump administration. They argued — as they and other environmental groups would in dozens of future cases — that it was illegal to suspend a rule for political reasons; there needed to be science and facts to back up such a decision, just as there had been when the rule was put into place. In this case, there were no such facts, and the EPA didn’t even bother to defend its decision in court, capitulating without a fight.

Early on, it looked as if the administration was just trying to see what it could get away with. Lawyers call this the no-plaintiff rule. “The impression I got was that their underlying strategy was: It’s only illegal if we get caught,” says Patrice Simms, vice president for litigation at Earthjustice.

Pruitt, Zinke, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross seemed to be pushing to roll back laws and regulations as fast as possible in an effort to impress their new boss. But in their haste to blow things up, they often ignored the laws and procedures for how to make policy. If you run out of Ambien and want to put yourself to sleep, try reading the Administrative Procedures Act, which spells out the process for creating or eliminating regulations. Trump officials flat-out ignored it, which left them vulnerable to lawsuits.

“This administration has no clue what they’re doing,” says Joanne Spalding, chief climate counsel at the Sierra Club. “They are trying to do all sorts of bad things but they’re actually bad at doing bad things. Partly because the things they want to do are illegal. But they’re also bad at it because they rush things through without satisfying the procedural requirements.”

With a chuckle, Spalding adds, “These are not evil geniuses.”

But that didn’t mean environmental lawyers could let their guard down — and not every case would be so easy. They assigned staffers to scour the Federal Register (another good Ambien substitute) and the websites of government agencies for any clues about new policy decisions. They also got tips from whistleblowers to look out for upcoming announcements or new policy proposals released without a press release or advisory notice. One time, NRDC lawyers got an anonymous package from an EPA insider. It looked like the person had written the address with their non-dominant hand, and it contained a copy of a 1977 U.S. Attorney General’s opinion that could help them in an ongoing suit against the EPA. “It looked like a ransom note,” Colangelo recalls.

The environmental movement’s legal strategy had another key element: the Freedom of Information Act. After Trump’s election, the Sierra Club was barraged with offers from outside lawyers to help out in any way they could. Elena Saxonhouse, an attorney at the Sierra Club, had an idea to put those volunteer lawyers to work filing FOIA requests for documents and, when necessary, suing the government to get them. The FOIA Force, she would go on to call them.

It’s typically the job of Congress to conduct oversight of federal agencies, but environmental groups couldn’t count on a Republican-controlled Congress to do that. So the FOIA Force, led by Saxonhouse, filed dozens of sweeping document requests. They wanted copies of all of Scott Pruitt’s communications with industry groups and conservative media outlets. They asked for emails sent and received by Pruitt’s closest aides and assistants. They requested Interior Secretary Zinke’s phone logs, calendars, and meeting records — and when the Interior ratcheted up the secrecy of how it operated, the Sierra Club sued the department to get those records too. When the agencies fought those requests, Sierra Club took them to court and each time forced them to hand over documents. As of last month, the Sierra Club had received more than 100,000 pages of emails from the EPA and Interior; many thousands more are still on the way.

The documents obtained by Sierra Club contained damning revelations. They showed how Pruitt coordinated with a former foreign lobbyist to arrange a personal getaway to the Outback while in Australia supposedly on government business. How Pruitt’s staff shielded him from public scrutiny and “unfriendly” journalists. How one of Pruitt’s closest aides reached out to the head of Chick-Fil-A to set up a meeting about making Pruitt’s wife a Chick-Fil-A franchisee. (Fun fact: A legal intern first discovered the Chick-Fil-A email buried in a trove of documents.)

The uncovering of these dealings prompted multiple ethics investigations and, it’s fair to say, contributed to Pruitt’s resignation in 2018. “We’ve uncovered things that we never would have if we had targeted our searches more narrowly,” Saxonhouse says. “There’s no trust at all in the people who are supposed to be protecting our air, water, and lands.”

THERE IS an ambivalence, a catch in the voice, when these lawyers reflect on the past two and a half years. They know they’re doing the most important work of their lives. “To be a participant in [this work] just makes me feel lucky to have the job,” Mitch Bernard, chief counsel at NRDC, tells me. “This is the reason I became a lawyer.”

A few minutes after we hang up, Bernard calls me back. He wants to clarify something. He feels good about the work he and his colleagues are doing but not good that they have to do it in the first place. “I don’t want to seem like I’m sugarcoating or passing over how horrible this situation is,” he says. “There’s also this darkness.”

This is how Drew Caputo of Earthjustice puts it: “I’m proud of our response, but the fact that we need to do it really pains me. When I started my career in the 1990s, environmentalism was [still] a bipartisan thing. Some of the most important environmental laws were signed into law by Richard Nixon.”

The environmental groups suing Trump have sued Democrats and Republicans in the past. “But the Trump folks, they’re just at a different scale,” Caputo adds. “Even tough administrations in the past, we’ve been able to talk to them on some issues. The Trump guys are just an unvarnished extension of industry.”

And sometimes the industry wins. While environmentalists have amassed a great track record fighting Trump’s agenda, there have been painful setbacks. These lawyers couldn’t stop the administration from repealing Obama’s Clean Power Plan or chipping away at the Endangered Species Act — two major accomplishments of the Trump crew so far. Environmental groups can sue to reverse those setbacks — several suits were filed last month against the EPA’s weak replacement for the Clean Power Plan, and litigation challenging the latest endangered species changes is coming soon — but that will take years to wind through the courts. “It’s heartbreaking to realize the limitations of a successful litigation strategy,” Colangelo says. “We’re winning cases to stop the worst things the administration is doing, but that isn’t enough to make them do the right thing.”

Nor can these lawyers prevent Trump’s allies in Congress from carrying out his deregulatory agenda. Environmentalists may have stymied Trump’s efforts to expand offshore drilling in the Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans, but they failed to prevent Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) from adding language to the 2017 Trump tax bill to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling, a longtime goal of the fossil-fuel industry and the Republican Party. (Conservation groups are considering legal action to stop the measure from going forward.) So it goes in the Trump era — win a protection in one case only to watch it flare up in a different direction.

What keeps these lawyers going, they say, is the fact that the nation’s judicial system has held firm at a time when the country’s other institutions are wobbling. They’ve won cases in front of Bush and Trump appointees and lost them in front of Obama and Clinton appointees, and vice versa. “The story that is not frequently enough told these days is that the courts have held up remarkably well,” Bernard says. “That’s the one branch of federal government that I think is shining in this moment because they are being very vigorous enforcing the law without regard to what the politics of the situation might be.”

The danger for the environmental movement is that the second wave of Trump appointees — ex-coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler at EPA, ex-oil and gas lobbyist David Bernhardt at Interior, and so on — prove more effective at undermining laws and regulations than their bumbling predecessors. Just this week, the Wheeler-led EPA announced its plan to revoke California’s ability to set tougher standards on tailpipe emissions, the leading source of pollution in the country.

“Pruitt and Zinke got in their own way in ways that Wheeler and Bernhardt are less likely to do,” Bernard says. “That will make it harder for people like us to challenge what they’re trying to do. Because their agenda is not more moderate. It’s just their way of going about putting it into effect that appears more moderate. That’s a danger for us.”

One stealthy tactic used by the current crop of administration officials is attacking the underlying science as a way to gut environmental and public-health protections. You can have a strong law to protect the air we breathe, but you can undermine that same law by mandating that the agency can only look at certain kinds of studies that narrowly define the problem. “They’re attacking the underlying architecture of the science,” says Patrice Simms of Earthjustice.

If anything, the Trump administration appears set to take more aggressive action between now and the 2020 election, like dismantling nationwide tailpipe emissions standards or weakening the Clean Water Act. “We’re going to have fights that are just as hard or harder over the course of the next year and a half,” Simms says. “Even if there is not a second Trump administration there is a lot of stuff that’s going to have to be fixed. The work is not going away anytime soon.”",mainstream
1047,"I was first introduced to Fogo Island, and the Fogo Island Inn – a hotel I’d seen in photos but never knew exactly where to find it – by Electrify Getaways, a newly-launched travel company that doesn’t just want to put you closer to locals, they’re actually working with creatives and leaders within each community to do so by providing otherwise unreachable people and community-driven experiences. And in a world where all too many groups make that promise, Electrify Getaways is setting themselves apart by going to destinations, and staying in places just like Fogo Island – places that offer an experience better than you could have even imagined, but that’s mostly because you didn’t even know that it was one that existed. And they’re going to other places too. Places like Rajasthan in India – the area around Jaipur that tourists often overlook, foolishly heading instead to Agra, Delhi and Mumbai instead. And to the Masai Mara and Lamu Island in Kenya, which is said to be one of the oldest living towns in East Africa and arguably the most fascinating Swahili town in existence. Lamu Island is a getaway filled with culture, forgotten by time. Much like Fogo Island.

And that’s partially because Fogo Island sits off the coast of Newfoundland island and arriving there involves three flights from New York or Los Angeles, making it feel just about as remote as you can get. And that’s exactly why Canada's Flat Earth Society believes that Brimstone Head, a massive rock jutting out of the island's northwestern coast, is one of the four corners of the flat earth, designating it that in the 1970s. (There’s even a Museum of the Flat Earth located on the island.)

I found all of that absolutely fascinating, solidifying the fact that I had to go and visit this strange part of the world for myself.

And it didn’t disappoint. So, what’s it like to head to what’s believed to be one of the four corners of the flat earth you might be asking yourself? Well, Electrify Getaways promised unique immersive experiences with locals in incredible destinations, and they delivered.

Despite being one of the coldest regions on the planet, Fogo Islanders are some of the warmest locals you’ll ever meet.

Like me, you’re probably not at all familiar with Fogo Island, and that’s okay. Let me break it down. Fogo Island is a tiny island that sits almost as far east as you can get within Canada (if you were to travel north from the island, you’d reach Greenland). The island’s population doesn’t quite reach 2,500, and locals are spread across 11 communities that make up the island. Locals speak with an almost uncanny Irish dialect that’s completely endearing, but it also completely throws you off at the same time. It will undoubtedly have you wondering whether you’re even still in Canada. (The subtle “ehs” thrown in here and there will remind you that you are.)

The landscape here is subarctic, and despite being 32 degrees Fahrenheit in May when I visited, the temperatures don’t seem to stop the locals from much. Being so remote from the mainland has taught the people here how to survive. Fish (and when a Fogo Islander says “fish,” they always mean cod – North Atlantic cod, to be exact) is a staple for most meals, and moose and foraged berries (there are 26 different kinds of edible berries on the island) can be found in almost every Fogo Islander’s freezer.

Locals say there are seven seasons here (spring, trap berth, summer, berry, late fall, winter and pack ice), and each day on the island brings a new surprise. I might have only been there for a handful of days, but I experienced weather on all ends of the spectrum – sun, rain, fog, clouds, wind, no wind – all of it. Layering up is an essential tip for surviving a day here.

All layered up and ready to explore, one of my favorite experiences on the island was a simple one – I was invited into a local home to make blueberry jam. Having traveled all around the world, jumped out of planes, trekked through jungles in Thailand, eaten crazy foods, and yet this simple gesture, and experience, somehow became one of my new favorite travel memories to date. Because the experience was so much more than just making blueberry jam – we talked about life on the island, drank coffee and tasted the most delicious molasses raisin cake – I was overwhelmed by how much I felt at home. Had I asked to spend the night, move in and be adopted by their family, they would have said yes without blinking an eye.

But the real star of the island is the 29 room Fogo Island Inn.

With views overlooking “Iceberg Alley,” which is named so because of the icebergs that make their way here from Greenland (you can even track which icebergs will be visiting during your stay on IcebergFinder.com – there were five hanging around during my visit), the Inn sits on the edge of a part of the island that you wouldn’t even imagine building on, which is also partially how the iconic stilts came to be (they’re also an homage to the fishing premises on the island).

The Inn’s 29 rooms were all designed with floor to ceiling sea-facing windows, which happens to make for ideal end of the earth gazing. The only plastic in any room is the telephone, and the furniture, including the iconic Bertha Chairs that they have perfectly arranged for said flat earth gazing, was all locally built at the Fogo Island Shop just up the road. Guests are encouraged to visit – and should.

Every detail within the rooms has been seamlessly thought through – guests can have white noise filter through the room at night just in case the quiet is more than they’re used to (it was), bathrooms have heated floors, towel racks and toilet seats for those cold Newfoundland days (a very appreciated touch), and fresh baked pastries and coffee wait outside every guest’s door in the morning to be enjoyed at leisure (they were the single-most thing I looked forward to everyday).

The hotel is the labor of love of Zita Cobb, but also a labor of love of the Fogo Island community. I was told that the hotel cost $40 million CAD to build, but when asking around, it became clear that that number wasn’t a part of the story they wanted to tell about the Inn. The Inn wasn’t built to show off wealth and status, it was built to bring life back into the community. And even when I asked about the owner, the common response was that the community owns the Inn. It’s still a for-profit business, but profits go into an entity known as Shorefast (which they creatively outline on this economic nutrition graphic), and profits then go back into the community. The Inn thrives because of the island, and the island thrives because of the Inn. It’s a beautiful cycle.

Foraging and snow crab in a shed – the food at the Inn tells the story of the island in a beautiful way.

Most great travel experiences these days starts with food. Food tells the story of a place through the ingredients and processes that they use. It shows how communities respect the land, as well as a part of a community’s history that might otherwise be forgotten in our modern age. The food, and the stories here, are no different.

As I usually do when I arrive in a new place, I asked every local about the local dishes I couldn’t leave without trying. Without skipping a beat, locals gave two answers: fish and brewis (pronounced “brews”) and cod tongues and scrunchions.

With fish and brewis and cod tongues and scrunchions on my mind, I headed behind the Inn to their newly built shed (I was told everyone had a shed here on the island – and that shed parties were a real thing – I knew I liked Fogo Island).

The shed at the Inn will eventually be a place where guests can be a part of this local tradition, with the Inn’s chefs leading intimate cooking demos, hosting small gatherings and just another general way to bring more of this area to life through food and stories (the chefs have some great ones). Finally getting a taste of cod tongue and scrunchions (cubed and fried pork fat), it was clear why every local recommended this dish. Cooked over a wood-fired stove (there’s no electricity in the shed), I was shown how to make this dish, just in case I ever needed a taste of Fogo Island at home. A spread of local dried and preserved ingredients – like dried lobster and rare blue chanterelle mushrooms – was also laid out and thoughtfully explained (some foraged from right around the Inn), and our shed party concluded with a feast of local snow crab and Canadian bubbles.

My taste of fish and brewis came the next day – I may have not so subtly hinted that I was dying to try it at our shed party – when Executive Chef Jonathan Gushue made sure it was available for my final breakfast. A seemingly simple dish of salt cod and hard bread, both soaked in water overnight, served with potatoes, cooked onions, more scrunchions and plenty of butter, it’s easy to understand how this dish came about (it was popular with fisherman since both salt cod and hard bread could last across long sea journeys), and why it’s still so popular – it’s delicious.

While much of Fogo Island was unfamiliar to me, especially coming from Los Angeles, I somehow felt as if I was home. Between the locals who shared stories about their lives on the island and tasting my way through the island’s surprising abundance of ingredients, even though I had traveled all the way to the end of the flat earth, I found myself in a place that I already knew: home.

1056,"Speakers recently flew in from around (or perhaps, across?) the Earth for a three-day event held in Birmingham: the UK’s first ever public flat Earth convention. It was well attended, and wasn’t just three days of speeches and YouTube clips (though, granted, there was a lot of this). There was also a lot of team-building, networking, debating, workshops – and scientific experiments.

Yes, flat earthers do seem to place a lot of emphasis and priority on scientific methods and, in particular, on observable facts. The weekend, in no small part, revolved around discussing and debating science, with lots of time spent running, planning, and reporting on the latest set of flat Earth experiments and models. Indeed, as one presenter noted early on, flat earthers try to “look for multiple, verifiable evidence” and advised attendees to “always do your own research and accept you might be wrong”.

While flat earthers seem to trust and support scientific methods, what they don’t trust is scientists, and the established relationships between “power” and “knowledge”. This relationship between power and knowledge has long been theorised by sociologists. By exploring this relationship, we can begin to understand why there is a swelling resurgence of flat earthers.

Let me begin by stating quickly that I’m not really interested in discussing if the Earth is flat or not (for the record, I’m happily a “globe earther”) – and I’m not seeking to mock or denigrate this community. What’s important here is not necessarily whether they believe the Earth is flat or not, but instead what their resurgence and public conventions, such as the one in Birmingham, tell us about science and knowledge in the 21st century.

Multiple competing models were suggested throughout the weekend, including “classic” flat Earth, domes, ice walls, diamonds, puddles with multiple worlds inside, and even the Earth as the inside of a giant cosmic egg. The level of discussion however often did not revolve around the models on offer, but on broader issues of attitudes towards existing structures of knowledge, and the institutions that supported and presented these models.

Flat earthers are not the first group to be sceptical of existing power structures and their tight grasps on knowledge. This viewpoint is somewhat typified by the work of Michel Foucault, a famous and heavily influential 20th century philosopher who made a career of studying those on the fringes of society to understand what they could tell us about everyday life.

He is well known, among many other things, for looking at the close relationship between power and knowledge. He suggested that knowledge is created and used in a way that reinforces the claims to legitimacy of those in power. At the same time, those in power control what is considered to be correct and incorrect knowledge. According to Foucault, there is therefore an intimate and interlinked relationship between power and knowledge.

At the time Foucault was writing on the topic, the control of power and knowledge had moved away from religious institutions, which previously had a very singular hold over knowledge and morality, and was instead beginning to move towards a network of scientific institutions, media monopolies, legal courts, and bureaucratised governments. Foucault argued that these institutions work to maintain their claims to legitimacy by controlling knowledge.

In the 21st century, we are witnessing another important shift in both power and knowledge due to factors that include the increased availability of public platforms afforded by social media. Knowledge is no longer centrally controlled and – as has been pointed out in the wake of Brexit – the age of the expert may be passing. Now, everybody has the power to create and share content. When Michael Gove, a leading proponent of Brexit, proclaimed: “I think the people of this country have had enough of experts”, it would seem that he, in many ways, meant it.

It is also clear that we’re seeing increased polarisation in society, as we continue to drift away from agreed singular narratives and move into camps around shared interests. Recent PEW research suggests, for example, that 80 per cent of voters who backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election – and 81 per cent of Trump voters – believe most supporters of the two candidates are unable to agree on basic facts, let alone policies.

Despite early claims, from as far back as HG Wells’s World Brain essays in 1936, that a worldwide, shared resource of knowledge, such as the internet, would create peace, harmony and a common interpretation of reality, it appears that quite the opposite has happened. With the increased voice afforded by social media to a wide range of views, knowledge has been increasingly decentralised, and competing narratives have emerged.

This was something of a recurring theme throughout the weekend in Birmingham, and was especially apparent when four flat earthers debated three physics PhD students. A particular point of contention occurred when one of the physicists pleaded with the audience to avoid trusting YouTube and bloggers. The audience and the panel of flat earthers took exception to this, noting that “now we’ve got the internet and mass communication … we’re not reliant on what the mainstream are telling us in newspapers, we can decide for ourselves”. It was readily apparent that the flat earthers were keen to separate knowledge from scientific institutions.

At the same time as scientific claims to knowledge and power are being undermined, some power structures are decoupling themselves from scientific knowledge, moving towards a kind of populist politics that is increasingly sceptical of knowledge. This has, in recent years, manifested itself in extreme ways – and can be seen in such examples as public figures showing support for Pizzagate or Trump’s suggestions that Ted Cruz’s father shot JFK.

But it can also be seen in more subtle and insidious forms: in the way in which Brexit, for example, was campaigned for in terms of gut feelings and emotions rather than expert statistics and predictions. Science is increasingly facing problems with its ability to communicate ideas publicly, a problem that flat earthers, and politicians, are able to circumvent with moves towards populism.

Again, this theme occurred throughout the weekend. Flat earthers were encouraged to trust “poetry, freedom, passion, vividness, creativity, and yearning” over the more clinical regurgitation of established theories and facts. Attendees were told that “hope changes everything”, and were warned against blindly trusting what they were told. This is a narrative echoed by some of the celebrities who have used their power to back flat Earth beliefs, such as the musician BOB, who tweeted: “Don’t believe what I say, research what I say.”

In many ways, a public meeting of flat earthers is a product and sign of our time; a reflection of our increasing distrust in scientific institutions, and the moves by power-holding institutions towards populism and emotions. In much the same way that Foucault reflected on what social outcasts could reveal about our social systems, there is a lot that flat earthers can reveal to us about the current changing relationship between power and knowledge. And judging by the success of this UK event – and the large conventions planned in Canada and America this year – it seems the flat Earth is going to be around for a while yet.

338,"The debate over genetically modified (GM) crops may be stalled in the European Union’s Council of Ministers, but last week the private sector appeared to deliver its own verdict on the future of the technology in Europe.

BASF, a German chemical company, announced on 16 January that it will end production of GM crops for the European market and move its plant-science headquarters from Limburgerhof in Germany to the United States. It will also close other sites in Germany and Sweden, though it will maintain existing facilities in Belgium and Berlin.

“There is still a lack of acceptance for this technology in many parts of Europe from the majority of consumers, farmers and politicians,” says Stefan Marcinowski, a member of BASF’s board. “It does not make business sense to continue investing in products exclusively for cultivation in this market.”

BASF will discontinue the marketing of the Amflora potato, one of only two GM crops authorised for cultivation by the European Commission. This will leave Monsanto’s MON810 maize as the only GM crop authorised for cultivation and marketed in the EU. Environmental campaigners cheered the move as a vindication of European consumers’ rejection of the technology. “It’s not often that we share an analysis with BASF, but they’re right that there’s no demand,” says Mute Schimpf, a food campaigner with Friends of the Earth.

But the biotechnology sector warned that Europe risks falling behind its global competitors because of “scaremongering and misinformation” about this emerging science, which changes the DNA of crops to make them more efficient. Werner Langen, a German centre-right MEP, says that the decision by BASF “shows that the patchwork of national regulations made in this field has made Europe an unattractive location” for GM research.

While authorisations of GM crops have increased steadily in other parts of the world, particularly the Americas, approval has been stalled in Europe for several years because of political opposition. Around 50 GM crops grown outside the EU have been authorised for import, mostly used for industrial use or animal feed.

Member states remain divided over the issue of GM crops. A blocking minority of countries – including Austria, Hungary, Poland and Greece – has refused to accept new authorisations for GM cultivation. This has irritated pro-GM countries such as the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK, which are eager to deploy the technology. The Commission has been able to authorise only these two crops for cultivation, and some member states have imposed national bans. These bans were eventually found to be illegal under single market rules.

Seeking a compromise, the Commission proposed allowing member states to enact their own national bans, with the implicit understanding that in exchange they would stop blocking new authorisations. But the proposal has remained stalled because the anti-GM states want to be able to ban the crops on the basis of environmental or health concerns. The Commission argues that this is not possible, because food cannot be deemed safe in one country but unsafe in another.

Last week’s announcement by BASF that it is abandoning its production of GM crops in Europe because of a lack of acceptance “from the majority of consumers, farmers and politicians” was an acknowledgement of a reality many biotechnology companies have been hesitant to countenance – Europe does not like genetically modified crops. A 2010 Eurobarometer survey found that 70% of Europeans think that GM food is “fundamentally unnatural”, and 59% say that such food is unsafe for their health. A 2003 government study in the United Kingdom found that only 2% of Britons would be happy to eat GM foods. So-called frankenfood, as the British tabloid press has dubbed them, have had a rough welcome in Europe. In December 2010 one million signatures calling for a ban on GM crops were delivered to the Commission as the first ‘citizens initiative’ created by the Lisbon treaty. But Europeans are virtually alone in this staunch resistance to GM crops. In north and south America, genetically modified crops have been introduced into the food chain without anyone much noticing or caring. A 2006 study by the Pew Research Group showed that Americans remain largely unaware of the existence of GM crops, with only 40% having heard of them and only 26% believing they have eaten them. The majority of Americans say they do not have concerns about GM crops. Public perception has translated into public policy. The EU’s two approvals of GM crops for cultivation do not match the more than 80 in the US and 36 in Brazil. China and India are also approving more GM crops, albeit more cautiously than in the Americas. The European Commission has tried to alleviate member state concerns about the crops by offering to let them opt out of EU authorisation, but the issue is stuck in the Council. Today 10% of the world’s arable land is growing GM crops. A report published by Friends of the Earth last year found that less than 0.06% of EU fields contain GM crops. Carel du Marchie Sarvaas of EuropaBio attributes the better reception of GM crops in the United States to faster movement by the industry. “In the US, the technology was already there when the anti-GM movement came on people’s radar,” he says. “In the Americas there’s much greater faith in science as a tool for progress, and the food industry in the Americas has been very supportive of science.” But according to Friends of the Earth, the increased focus in Europe is the result of work by non-governmental organisations to bring the issue to the public’s attention. “A lot of European consumers are concerned about the open questions of health with GM crops,” she says. “In north and south America they have no labelling system, and consumers are not aware of what’s going on.” “We cannot ignore the massive opposition in Europe,” says Ladislav Miko, deputy director-general for the food chain in the Commission’s health department. “This is why we believe the issue needs more clarity and more public information.” “People need to be convinced there are benefits for the normal citizen,” he adds. “If they think the benefit is just for farmers and companies, people won’t support that.”

Environmental campaigners are urging the anti-GM states to stand their ground, saying it is reasonable to have different health concerns in different countries. “Europe is quite diverse, you have specific ecosystems in different member states,” says Schimpf. She is unaware of any other products that have different environmental concerns in different states, but says GM crops are unlike other products of concern because they can multiply and they enter the food chain.

GM crops have been around for 15 years, and to date no adverse health effects from approved strains have been documented anywhere in the world. European consumers are already eating meat from animals raised on GM feed imported into the EU, and no adverse health effects have been found. But environmental campaigners say not enough is yet known about the health effects, and more research is needed before they are embraced. “The EU needs to follow the precautionary principle,” says Schimpf.

But advocates of GM crops say that such hesitation is foolish when the potential of the technology to solve societal challenges is so large. “We have a rapidly increasing population, we have to produce more food and we have to do it more sustainably,” says Carel du Marchie Sarvaas, a director with EuropaBio, a pan-European biotechnology industry group. “The only way to do that is to produce more from the same amount of land. [GM crops] allow farmers to produce more yield per hectare.” He adds that more efficient crops mean less time spent tilling the land, translating to fewer CO2 emissions from farm equipment.

In Spain, the EU country that has embraced GM crops most enthusiastically, farmers have reported getting from 6% to 30% more yield by using Monsanto’s MON810 maize. Between 2010 and 2011, Spain saw a 27% increase in the acreage planted. Portugal, which started planting GM later, saw a 59% increase during that time.

Much has been made of the potential of GM crops to combat famine in Africa, and Bill Gates has been one of the leading advocates of the technology to help developing countries (see interview, Page 4). Strains of drought-resistant maize are currently being developed, as well as virus-resistant strains of staple crops.

But many groups and governments remain doubtful about the technology. Aside from the perceived uncertainty around health, campaigners are also concerned that the use of GM crops is giving rise to pesticide-resistant plants. Biotechnology companies have insisted that this trend is not linked to the use of GM crops, but is a normal problem encountered when crops are not properly rotated.

Ethical objections have also been raised to the practice of patenting the GM seeds. Farmers normally pay a one-time price for seeds, which they can then save and replant. But GM seeds are acquired through the payment of a licence fee for the intellectual property. This was the case for BASF’s Amflora potato. “It’s a democratic question – do we want to allow a few companies to control what we eat?” asks Schimpf.

But with the rest of the world increasingly embracing GM crops, is it possible for Europe to be a GM-free continent? That question is being asked at both a macro and micro level. Even if the anti-GM countries secure the right to enact national bans on environmental grounds, there are questions over cross-fertilisation from neighbouring countries. If Austria enacts a ban, the wind can carry seeds from neighbouring Germany, campaigners warn.

EuropaBio rejects this argument. “Political realism means we accept that the way forward is that some countries will choose to grow GM crops and some won’t,” says du Marchie Sarvaas. “They can exist as non-GM ‘islands’,” he says, adding that some farms grow GM crops alongside conventional crops and there is still no cross-fertilisation. “But Europe cannot determine what the people from whom they import grow, and that’s the challenge.”

This challenge has already been encountered. Last year the Commission was forced to end its zero-tolerance policy for imports, which barred a shipment from entering the EU if it contained any trace of a GM strain not authorised in the EU. This was changed to a threshold of 0.1% after some crops were mistakenly sent back. With so many GM crops being used in the Americas, cases of contamination in imports are a concern.

But Schimpf says the embrace of GM crops in the Americas should not pressure the EU into going in the same direction. “For me, it’s the same as when we have higher labour standards,” she says. “We can insist that importers must comply with EU standards. Europe wouldn’t authorise a car just because it was authorised in China, we want to have our own safety checks.” With the expansion of GM planting across the world, the pressure on the EU to make up its mind one way or the other will only increase.",mainstream

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A collapsed off-ramp in Alaska’s largest city that became an iconic image of the destructive force of a magnitude 7.0 earthquake was rebuilt and reopened four days after its destruction.

The ramp, which leads to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, reopened between 1:30 and 3:30 a.m. Tuesday, said Shannon McCarthy, spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities.

The earthquake struck at 8:29 a.m. Friday and was followed by a magnitude 5.7 quake. Aftershocks of 4.0 or larger were regular occurrences afterward.

When rocking from the first quake stopped, McCarthy said, highway officials recognized they had multiple breaks in “essential travel.” They identified eight sites of highest priority.

One was the off-ramp that carried traffic from south Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula to the state’s largest airport. A small station wagon on the ramp when it collapsed dropped down at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) but came to rest upright on a flat piece of roadway surrounded by jumbled sections of earth. No one inside was injured.

President Donald Trump and former Gov. Bill Walker declared emergencies, allowing highway officials to order reconstruction immediately.

“We basically called the contracting community, and we split up the sites between multiple contractors and our construction staff,” McCarthy said.

Anchorage asphalt plants had been shut down for the season in late October. It can take more than a week to get them up and running, McCarthy said, depending on the moisture content in the rock incorporated into the mix.

“As soon as the quake happened, as soon as the contractors felt their asphalt plants were safe, they ran over and started up their asphalt plants,” she said.

Earthwork at the off-ramp began before the sun set Friday. By the time heavy equipment had filled in and packed down the ramp, asphalt was ready to be laid down, a feat not often attempted in December.

“That’s almost unheard of,” McCarthy said. Crews applied paint while the asphalt was warm.

Temperatures in mid-November had dropped to single digits. But over the weekend, temperatures stayed near or above freezing

“Still not great, but a little bit warmer,” McCarthy said.

Work at other sites is progressing. The Glenn Highway, the only highway leading north from Anchorage, fully reopened Wednesday morning. Two sinkholes created crescent-shape craters near Mirror Lake and got bigger with every 4.0 aftershock, McCarthy said. It took until Wednesday to repair all six lanes.

The department will monitor that site, where the speed limit is 65 mph (104 kph), for dips as winter progresses. Permanent repairs will be made in spring, she said.",mainstream
474,"The NASA InSight spacecraft launches onboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas-V rocket on May 5, 2018, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. - NASA on May 5 launched its latest Mars lander, called InSight, designed to perch on the surface and listen for 'Marsquakes' ahead of eventual human missions to explore the Red Planet.

With just a day to go, NASA's InSight spacecraft aimed for a bull's-eye touchdown on Mars, zooming in like an arrow with no turning back.

InSight's journey of six months and 300 million miles (482 million kilometers) comes to a precarious grand finale Monday afternoon.

The robotic geologist — designed to explore Mars' insides, surface to core — must go from 12,300 mph (19,800 kph) to zero in six minutes flat as it pierces the Martian atmosphere, pops out a parachute, fires its descent engines and, hopefully, lands on three legs.

It is NASA's first attempt to land on Mars in six years, and all those involved are understandably anxious.

NASA's top science mission official, Thomas Zurbuchen, confided Sunday that his stomach is already churning. The hardest thing is sitting on his hands and doing nothing, he said, except hoping and praying everything goes perfectly for InSight.

""Landing on Mars is one of the hardest single jobs that people have to do in planetary exploration,"" noted InSight's lead scientist, Bruce Banerdt. ""It's such a difficult thing, it's such a dangerous thing that there's always a fairly uncomfortably large chance that something could go wrong.""

Earth's success rate at Mars is 40 percent, counting every attempted flyby, orbital flight and landing by the U.S., Russia and other countries dating all the way back to 1960.

But the U.S. has pulled off seven successful Mars landings in the past four decades. With only one failed touchdown, it's an enviable record. No other country has managed to set and operate a spacecraft on the dusty red surface.

It's shooting for Elysium Planitia, a plain near the Martian equator that the InSight team hopes is as flat as a parking lot in Kansas with few, if any, rocks. This is no rock-collecting expedition. Instead, the stationary 800-pound (360-kilogram) lander will use its 6-foot (1.8-meter) robotic arm to place a mechanical mole and seismometer on the ground.

The self-hammering mole will burrow 16 feet (5 meters) down to measure the planet's internal heat, while the ultra-high-tech seismometer listens for possible marsquakes. Nothing like this has been attempted before at our smaller next-door neighbor, nearly 100 million miles (160 million kilometers) away.

No experiments have ever been moved robotically from the spacecraft to the actual Martian surface. No lander has dug deeper than several inches, and no seismometer has ever worked on Mars.

By examining the deepest, darkest interior of Mars — still preserved from its earliest days — scientists hope to create 3D images that could reveal how our solar system's rocky planets formed 4.5 billion years ago and why they turned out so different. One of the big questions is what made Earth so hospitable to life.

Mars once had flowing rivers and lakes; the deltas and lakebeds are now dry, and the planet cold. Venus is a furnace because of its thick, heat-trapping atmosphere. Mercury, closest to the sun, has a surface that's positively baked.

The planetary know-how gained from InSight's $1 billion, two-year operation could even spill over to rocky worlds beyond our solar system, according to Banerdt. The findings on Mars could help explain the type of conditions at these so-called exoplanets ""and how they fit into the story that we're trying to figure out for how planets form,"" he said.

Concentrating on planetary building blocks, InSight has no life-detecting capability. That will be left for future rovers. NASA's Mars 2020 mission, for instance, will collect rocks for eventual return that could hold evidence of ancient life.

Because it's been so long since NASA's last Martian landfall — the Curiosity rover in 2012 — Mars mania is gripping not only the space and science communities, but everyday folks.

Viewing parties are planned coast to coast at museums, planetariums and libraries, as well as in France, where InSight's seismometer was designed and built. The giant NASDAQ screen in New York's Times Square will start broadcasting NASA Television an hour before InSight's scheduled 3 p.m. EST touchdown; so will the National Air and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. The InSight spacecraft was built near Denver by Lockheed Martin.

But the real action, at least on Earth, will unfold at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, home to InSight's flight control team. NASA is providing a special 360-degree online broadcast from inside the control center.

Confirmation of touchdown could take minutes — or hours. At the minimum, there's an eight-minute communication lag between Mars and Earth.

A pair of briefcase-size satellites trailing InSight since liftoff in May will try to relay its radio signals to Earth, with a potential lag time of under nine minutes. These experimental CubeSats will fly right past the red planet without stopping. Signals also could travel straight from InSight to radio telescopes in West Virginia and Germany. It will take longer to hear from NASA's Mars orbiters.

Project manager Tom Hoffman said he's trying his best to stay outwardly calm as the hours tick down. Once InSight phones home from the Martian surface, though, he expects to behave much like his three young grandsons did at Thanksgiving dinner, running around like crazy and screaming.

""Just to warn anybody who's sitting near me ... I'm going to unleash my inner 4-year-old on you, so be careful,"" he said.

305,"The only certainty we have in our lives is that we know nothing. Kind of ironic, don’t you think? We have just recently started to learn about our world and our history, yet our understanding is extremely restricted and incomplete.

One of the most puzzling aspects of our existence is the source of all life, the beginning point that led to the creations of this world and the diverse life it hosts.

Throughout history, many different religions have sprung up trying to explain the meaning of life, creating a system of morality, leading to the dogmatic nature of our belief system.

There was a time when creationist theories were dominant. Although, there have been many different versions and interpretations explaining divinity and creationism, all pretty much conformed to similar foundations.

For example, the Abrahamic religions all conform to similar beliefs with slight variations, yet all claiming to be authentic, while disproving the same foundational beliefs they are built upon.

Now creationist theories have lost their luster, and evolutionist theories are gaining more credibility. But even the modern scientific theories fail to adequately explain the missing link between our leap from homo-erectus to homo-sapiens.

Today, we have various alternative theories that attempt to explain humanity’s evolution.

The Sumerian Cuneiform tablets discovered in the 17th century provide an alternative understanding. A lot of these alternative narratives were slow to enter mainstream knowledge and thought. The main reason why certain knowledge that contradicted biblical accounts was slow to surface was due to the absolute control exerted by the Church in earlier times.

Since the Roman Catholic Church had great influence over the civilized world, they would only allow archaeological expeditions that helped perpetuate their own narrative, the narrative dictated by the canonical Bible.

The God that the Old Testament talks about, Yahweh, is the same God or deity worshiped by the people of the Ancient Sumerian city of Ur, who was known as Enlil.

Proof of Enlil and his divine relatives can be found in the various temples from Assur to Nineveh to Ur. Enlil’s brother Enki, along with his children Innana and Nannar also had temples dedicated to them in various prominent trade and cultural centers. These higher beings were known as the Anunnaki.

The Genesis mentions them both, Enlil and Enki, along with some prehistoric tablets. These accounts dictate that these beings were involved in genetic engineering to produce workers, the Homo sapiens.

We also have historical records of a document, dating around 5,000 years ago, that provides a rather vivid account of the creation of human beings through genetic engineering.

This also helps explain the story of Noah, who according to historical accounts, was around 600 years old at the time of the flood that nearly destroyed the world.

The Bible tells us that Noah was the son of a divine being. What if this divine being was an extra-terrestrial entity – an assumption that would explain the abnormally long lifespan Noah enjoyed?

According to Mantheo, an Egyptian historian and priest, the first dynastic rulers and Egyptian gods ruled the region for about 12,300 years.

Interestingly, Sumerian texts dictate that Enki was assigned as the ruler of Egypt and Africa by Anu, his father, around 3760 BCE, the same time as the Jewish calendar starts, which also has its roots in Nippur, a Sumerian city.

According to the Sumerian culture, all aspects of their civilization were taught to them by their “Gods.” This makes sense considering their unusually detailed and accurate knowledge of Earth’s orbital plane, spherical shape, tilted axis, and the construction of the Zodiac.

However, in Middle-Age Europe, a period considered by historians to have been far more modern and scientifically advanced in comparison to the Sumerian civilization, scientists believed the Earth to be flat, whereas, Sumerians possessed advanced knowledge of mathematics, law codes, metallurgy, astronomy, had one of the most advanced alphabets and produced many inventions. Our history is clearly wrong.

All this evidence forces us to think about all of what we have been taught so far, shattering all of our beliefs and causing severe dissonance.

However, once a person is over the initial phase and simply examines the conflicting information regarding the prevailing beliefs, they acquire more clarity, as old misconceptions and fallacies are left redundant.

Without our beliefs clouding our view of the world and all of the evidence pointing towards an alternative truth, we are forced to look at history all over again and discover the influence of the Anunnaki.

All of the evidence that we have, correlates the Sumerian god with the God of the Old Testament. For example, Enlil, the Sumerian God of Storm highly resembles the Wrathful and vengeful God in the Old Testament.

The primary reason for this information not being part of the mainstream is due to the influence exerted by the dominant ruling powers or superpower on our mainstream culture.

Consequently, those who have ever ventured away from the mainstream religious teachings, have been considered as deviants and labeled with derogatory terms such as occultists or pagans. This results in the rejection of new ideas by the mainstream society and the polarization prevents people from seeking or advocating for the truth.

The perfect example of the ruling party narrating their version of truth is present not only in our history but also in present time.

Let’s examine the cradle of civilization, the Middle East, where all three dominant religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, were born.

Since the Middle Ages, these three religious factions have been involved in a perpetual war in the same region as the ancient land of Canaan. All of these religious factions originate from Sumer.

The devotees of Yahweh or, originally, Enlil, still find themselves in conflict with the followers of Enki. The current conflicts in Israel, Iraq, Iran, Syria and other surrounding countries seem to be linked with the past wars that took place in the same region between the Gods, Enlil and Enki and their respective offsprings.

In other words, the violent conflicts that we are witnessing today, are the same, never ending, wars for supremacy of the Anunnaki.

According to leading Sumerologists, the term Anunnaki is interpreted as “those who descended from the heaven to earth.” An important point to note is the word heaven, which is used to refer to the planet of origin for the Anunnaki.

Their home planet was called Nibiru, which is explained in the book, “The 12th Planet” by the renowned author, Zecharia Sitchin.

The planet Nibiru has been frequently associated with the term Heaven, as used in the Bible. This little detail is of particular importance when re-examining religious prayers such as “Our father who art in heaven”, which provides us with a whole new perspective on who this father is and what heaven truly refers to.

Hence, we find the correlation between many Biblical prayers and its origination from Anu’s children who ruled the earth as Gods.

According to Sitchin, the reason for Anunnaki’s departure from their home planet to earth is because of its location, which lies beyond Pluto and is entrapped in a 3,600 year long retrograde elliptical orbit around the center of our galaxy, the sun.

Nibiru’s location is dictated by Sumerian maps, which was consolidated when Dr. Harrington discovered a large planet and conveyed his discovery in reports from the 1983 IRAS Naval Observatory.

The planet was found in the same region dictated by Sumerian accounts. Meaning, the planet that is home to the Anunnaki is real and inbound to perihelion, a point in orbit that is closest to the sun, around 1,400 years from now.

There are many dwarf planetary bodies that we do not consider as planets due to their size. They do not receive the necessary solar radiation to maintain habitable surface temperatures.

Because of this, life on this alien planet could only be sustained artificially, through technology that is unknown to us, or some other natural phenomena, such as steam that is released from geothermal heat.

According to Sitchin’s research and translations on the history time line, around 450,000 years ago, Nibiru’s environment was reaching extinction levels, especially when it was nearest to the sun.

The need to look for another habitable planet, led the leaders of the planet to travel inwards, where they found Earth, which was not only the perfect environment for life but also rich in many resources such as Gold.

Due to the superior technology possessed by the Anunnaki, they could use our planet’s gold reserves in an attempt to save their own civilization, by dispersing ionized particles of gold dust into their planet’s atmosphere.

As a result, Anu and his two sons, Enlil and Enki, came to our planet to mine for gold. Anu put Enki in charge of Earth’s excavation operations.

However, due to Niburian inheritance laws, the elder son is the rightful heir to the throne. Enlil was the eldest son of Anu and Anu’s sister (hence of royal blood), whereas, Enki, was the younger son of a non royal mother.

Anu’s decision to put Enki in charge of Earth’s mining operations, resulted in a fierce rivalry between the two brothers.

Once the Anunnaki arrived on Earth, Anu divided and assigned various locations for mining operations. Enki was assigned Africa, Enlil was in charge of Mesopotamia, and Inanna, his granddaughter, was responsible for the Indus Valley region.

All of this was finalized in 3760 BCE, hence, the significance of the date.

The labor was conducted by subservient workers, known as Igigi or the Watchers. These workers worked hard under slave-like conditions for some time but, overtime grew disillusioned by the perpetuity of their situation and revolted against the Anunnaki.

In order to acquire labor, the Anunnaki resorted to genetic engineering, which resulted in a new species and a primitive worker, the Homo-sapiens.

715,"A honeycombed cave formed untold millennia ago beneath what is now southeastern Minnesota. Larry Edwards is standing in a subterranean chamber, his headlamp illuminating a series of mineral formations. From the cathedral-like ceiling dangle tubes known as soda straws. Along a waist-high ledge squats a trio of stout stalagmites, their surfaces slick with ecru-colored ooze. “Now that’s the kind of thing we might be interested in,” Edwards says, bending to peer at one.

I hear the plink, plink, plink of falling droplets. One hits the top of a stalagmite, then spreads out, laying down a thin film of the mineral calcium carbonate, or calcite, from rainwater seeping though limestone. Drop by drop the stalagmite has grown to its present height—about 18 inches—over who knows how many centuries.

Edwards, a geochemist at the University of Minnesota and a pioneer in the use of cave formations to document ancient climate, is not planning to collect stalagmites today. But two specimens severed from their moorings when the owner of the cave complex, Spring Valley Caverns, opened a deeper passageway recently provided Edwards and his colleagues with a record of extreme rainfall events over the past 3,000 years. Edwards wonders if some of Spring Valley’s stalagmites could contain older records still, dating back to when giant glaciers covered much of the Northern Hemisphere or even to one of the distant warm periods, or interglacials, that punctuated the ice age world.

A short time later, we retrace our steps, navigating the sequence of walkways and ladders that leads to the cave’s entrance. As we step into the light, Edwards turns to me. “Do you notice all the sounds, all the smells?” he says. “When you come up, they seem so pronounced.” Edwards, renowned among paleoclimatologists for his cave findings, isn’t much of a spelunker. “It’s not that I’m claustrophobic,” he says with a shrug, “I just like it better up here.”

To Edwards, a stalagmite is more than a chunk of geology that looks like a modern sculpture: It’s a collection of climate sensors, rather like tree rings but extending often hundreds of thousands of years back in time. Perhaps the only other earthly archives that have provided such a high-resolution portrait of the past half-million years are ice cores.

But unlike ice, caves can be found all over the world. “I would go so far as to say that these are among the most important paleoclimate records we have,” David Battisti, a University of Washington atmospheric scientist, says of the cave data.

From Edwards’ lab is emerging a high-resolution picture of precipitation patterns long ago. Just as important, his work is providing the scientific community with an increasingly precise time scale, one that is bringing other records into alignment. Edwards and his colleagues have used cave formations to tighten up the timing for ancient rises in carbon dioxide locked into Antarctica’s ice. They’ve even used them to date skeletal remains that trace human migration routes.

Why should we care about what happened so long ago? A reason can be found in the mounting nervousness over the consequences of global warming. With heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere already reaching levels not seen for at least 800,000 years, scientists like Edwards worry that weather patterns could undergo sudden, destabilizing changes.

Ice cores from Greenland, for instance, reveal a sequence of abrupt temperature oscillations over the past 140,000 years, with severe cold snaps leavened by a series of sudden, if ephemeral, warmings. Eerily similar oscillations are now showing up in the precipitation records from caves. In a landmark study, Edwards and his collaborators compared the precipitation swings captured by Hulu Cave on the outskirts of Nanjing, China, with temperatures encoded by Greenland’s ice. Plotted as graphs, and positioned side by side, the dips and valleys in both records are sharp and—for the 60,000-year period covered by the stalagmites—synchronous.",mainstream

233,"People who belief in the Flat Earth Theory hold the conviction that the earth is flat and not round. This theory started to become more and more popular around 2009 and is growing ever since. It is considered one of the most controversial conspiracy theories existing. They claim the Earth to be flat because for them it feels like and looks like it is. The ones believing in this Theory call themself “The Flat Earth Society” and the importance about this is that even though there is evidence to the contrary they claim those “to be fabrications of a ‘round Earth conspiracy’”(Wolchover).

The believers in the Flat Earth Theory think that the “Earth is a disc with the Arctic Circle in the center and Antarctica, a 150-foot-tall wall of ice, around the rim.”(Wolchover). Believers claim that the NASA guards protect those ice walls from people that try to climb over and fall from the disc. In their eyes they also believe that Earth’s gravity is an illusion and objects do not accelerate downward, they are “driven up by a mysterious force called dark energy”.

On the opposite end, there are countless photographs, videos, and imagery from astronauts and from the International Space Station that is enough evidence to show that the Earth is actually round, but the interesting part here is that even though there is evidence that prove their claims wrong in their eyes it is not considered real evidence and faked by the government.

Those who believe in it most likely misinterpret the evidence and are only looking for beliefs that would confirm their owns. This is also called confirmation bias. In this case they ignore the real evidence that the earth is round and label them as ‘fake’, whereas when something in any way would support their beliefs has to be correct. Another cognitive contribution is groupthink, which is a concept that people within a group “value harmony and coherence above rational thinking”(PsychologyToday). This often results in dysfunctional outcomes and irrational beliefs. In this case, Flat Earth Society members do not want to doubt or judge the others beliefs and therefore strengthen their owns.

The flat Earth model started in the ancient where many cultures believed in a flat Earth “until the classical the Bronze Age” (Wikipedia). It became more controversial again, because the moon landing in 1959 came with a lot of skepticism. Flat earth theorists believe that the moon landing was fake and the pictures and audios recorded from that time were fabrications. They believe that GPS devices and maps are fake and that the International Space Station is a fake space station, believing it would be cheaper to promote a fake station rather than build a real one. The primary social influence that maintains their belief is groupthink. Social reinforcement form like-minded people allows them to feel sane when they speak of the topic and feel that their opinions are respected and justified.

Even though this theory can be proven wrong by a lot of evidence, the human brain and different psychological concept show how one can persists with their beliefs due to groupthink or biases. Human also love searching for meaning and drawing connections between things that sometimes have no tangible connection between them. It is simply human nature.",mainstream

Skifield man: It is important to know what is happening in your water supply. Monitoring allows the person responsible for supplying the water to know if, for example, the turbidity is too high, or if the UV is not working, or if there is E coli in the water.

Microbiological sampling involves taking an amount of water and trying to cultivate bacteria in the water. Field analysis involves small instruments to check FAC, pH or turbidity. Remote monitoring uses some kind of monitoring system to tell you what is happening in your water supply.

How do we know that the 3 principles are working? We need to have quality control assurance, which means that your treatment and reticulation system needs to be monitored.

[The location changes to a lake, where a different man is out on a boat. He sits next to a box with small sample bottles inside it, and has a sampling pole with a clamp on the end. He is wearing a life jacket.]

Boating sampler: When taking samples from a treatment plant or reticulation system, health and safety can be a concern and needs to be considered.

[Now he is sitting at the top of a water tower. There is a ladder against the tower.]

Safe access to sampling sites is really important. This includes entry into a confined space such as a reservoir, or a pump or valve chamber. The hazards with doing this [the ladder falls down] can include things like lack of oxygen, falling from ladders or even drowning.

Now, sampling source water from a surface supply such as a river, that might mean you've got to wade into the river, and so you've got to be careful about that, don't get washed away. If samples are to be taken from a lake, you may have to use a boat, and in that case you've got to make sure that you're capable of handling the boat safely. Well, a second person should always be there, just to help out if things go bad.

[The location changes to the lake docks, where a different man stands with a sampling pole.]

Lake-side sampler: There are ways of doing things and tools available which can reduce the risk of an accident. Proper training and equipment for entering confined spaces or working around water might make the difference between getting a job done and having a bad day.

[Close up on the sampling pole holding a bottle in the clamp.]

Lake-side sampler [voice-over]: The use of things like sampling poles with clamps to hold bottles on the end are helpful.

Lake-side sampler: They can remove the need to enter water that is being sampled. The most important thing is to think about the workplace risks and hazards of the things you're doing, then work out how you can reduce the risks.

[The location changes to a laboratory, with a UV light box, an incubator, and lots of flasks in the background. A woman stands behind the bench.]

Female lab worker: When taking samples, a number of things need to be considered. Firstly, you need to make sure that the sample being collected is representative of the water you want to test. The whole point of sampling is to test a small amount of water, the results of whice can tell you about the water as a whole.

For example, it is not a good idea to take a microbiological sample from the surface film on the water, where the air and water meet –

[Shot of a bottle attached to the sampling pole entering the water]

Female lab worker [voice-over]: – because things in the water here could contaminate the sample. [The bottle is dipped under the surface film of the water, and is removed once it is full.] You need to take the water from underneath the surface.

[Back the the man in the boat.]

Boating sampler: If you want to sample the water going into a treatment plant, you need to take it from the intake pipes, or as near to the plant as possible. If you're using water from a lake, sampling the water from the other side of the lake wouldn't be representive of the water going into the plant.

[The location changes to an office, where a young woman and an older man are talking.]

Older man: If you are going to sample water from within the treatment plant, you need to think about what you are trying to find out – [Woman makes agreeing noise] – what it is you want the sample to show you.

Young woman: Yeah. And if you're using UV disinfection, the inactivation of pathogens is instantaneous. If treatment involves filtration, the removal of pathogens also happens in the time of filtration.

Older man: That's right. So if you want to know if the process is effective, you can take the sample straight after the treatment process.

Young woman: However, some disinfectants need time for the process to work effectively.

Older man: Mm. If you use chlorine as a disinfectant, then a certain amount of contact time is needed in order for the chlorine to inactivate the pathogens.

Young woman: So if a sample is taken close to where the chlorine is added, the test results may show an inaccurate result. The sample needs to be taken further through the system.

Older man: Probably from the water in the contact or treated storage tanks.

[Shot of a street map, with a water treatment plant highlighted on the map. The shot pans across the map.]

Kitchen sampler [voice-over]: In a reticulation system, the water in the reticulation system is likely to be of a poorer quality than the water leaving the treatment plant. So you might want to take a sample from the very end of the reticulation system, [The map shows a highlighted household some distance from the treatment plant] maybe the household tap.

[Crossfade to a man in a kitchen with a sample bottle.]

Kitchen sampler: If you're doing microbiological sampling, it's best to sample from the extremities of the system. [He turns on the tap.] If you want to know if the water in the system is retaining its FAC, you could sample twice – once at the treatment plant, and once in the reticulation system.

[The location changes to a stream running through the bush. A woman standing on some nearby rocks, with a sample bottle hold onto a sampling pole.]

Stream sampler: Another very important problem is the potential for the person collecting the sample to contaminate it. If the person taking the sample is collecting it while standing in the water, they may contaminate the water. Bottles clamped to the end of a pole can be used to take samples in such a way [she dips the pole into the stream] that the sampler doesn't need to go into the water for microbiological sampling. [She lifts the pole up again, with a full bottle on the end.] The sample bottle needs to be sterile.

For chemical sampling, the bottle needs to be chemically clean. For some analysis, preservatives may need to be added or reagents need to be in the bottle before the sample is collected. Laboratories will provide you with the correct sample bottles.

[The location changes to a stream with a bridge running over it. A man stands next to the stream, holding a bottle with the lid removed.]

Sampler: The lid must not be put on the ground when the sample is taken, as contaminants may get on the lid. In fact the lid should be held the right way up while the sample is being taken. [The man puts the bottle into the water, and describes how he does it.]

Sampler [voice-over]: The bottle must be pushed through the surface of the water facing down, and then held towards the flow of the stream.

[The location changes to a lake, where the man holds a full bottle. He indicates his hand.]

Sampler: In this way, contaminants from the collector's hand don't contaminate the sample.

If the water is not flowing, such as in a lake, the bottle must be moved forwards to create a flow, see?

[He moves a bottle through the water and it fills up.]

Sampler [voice-over]: If you're sampling from a boat, the sample must be taken upstream of the boat.

Sampler [voice-over]: And once the sample has been collected, make sure the container isn't contaminated by putting fingers or pH probes or anything else like that into the bottle.

Female lab worker [voice-over]: The sample must then be labelled with the details of the sample – the date and time of sampling [arrows point at 8/11 and 08:46] and the name of the sampler [an arrow points at PB].

[We see the woman in the laboratory again. She has a labelled bottle in front of her.]

Female lab worker: It is very important to discuss the samples you are collecting with the laboratory that will be doing the analysis. They should be able to provide you with written instructions on how to take each of the samples you are collecting.

Lake-side sampler: Now it's not possible to test for all the pathogens that could contaminate a water supply. So what we use is one microorganism – the bacteria E. coli – to indicate if the water has faecal contamination. If any E. coli is present, then this should be seen as an indication that the source water is contaminated and your treatment processes aren't coping, or there's a problem of some kind.

This should raise some questions – has something changed in the catchment?

Lake-side sampler [voice-over]: Has someone moved cattle or shape through an area upstream of the intake?

[Shot of some diggers doing work next to a stream.]

Lake-side sampler [voice-over]: Has there been a landslip in the catchment that's making the water dirty? Is the disinfection system ineffective due to the turbidity?

[Shot of an exposed pipe in a muddy hole.]

Lake-side sampler [voice-over]: Is there a problem in the reticulation system, I don't know, backflow, for example?

Lake-side sampler: Should the chlorine dose be increased? Or should the whole system be shut down for a while so the problem can be found and fixed? You might even need to tell people to boil their drinking water until things are sorted out.

Female lab worker: E. coli analysis needs to be done by a laboratory, with the special equipment needed to incubate samples and grow the bacteria. Normally a water supplier will collect a sample in a sterile container provided by the lab, and then take the sample to the lab to be cultured.

There are a number of ways to analyse for E. coli. But they all involve growing the bacteria, and counting or calculating how many there are. And the number of E. coli in a sample tells you how badly contaminated the water is.

[The location changes to a shed with a water tank out the back.]

Man by water tank: Worldwide, E. coli sampling is the standard way of showing their water is safe to drink. But microbiological sampling is not the only sampling that can be done. Things like free available chlorine, pH and turbidity can tell a water supply operator a lot about their system and how well it's operating. Larger water suppliers generally monitor their system's performance by using continuous online probes testing all the time. However, smaller suppliers will generally sample manually.

[The location changes to a treatment plant, where a woman stands with lots of monitoring equipment around her.]

Treatment plant woman: Chlorine, when it's added to water supply, reacts with organic material in the water. That's how it inactives bacteria and viruses. But this uses up some of the chlorine and the chlorine that is left is called 'free available chlorine' or FAC.

FAC reduces over time. Sunlight or warm temperatures also reduce FAC. So if you're using chlorine as a disinfectant, it's important to test the FAC to make sure you've got enough to do the job.

But you need to test for FAC on site. Because if you take the sample then wait for a couple of hours to do the analysis, the results will probably change.

[Shot of a chlorine analyser that has a sample bottle inserted.]

Treatment plant woman [voice-over]: You can test FAC by using an electronic analyser with a digital read-out.

[Shot of the woman adding a chemical to a test tube of water. The water turns red. There is a chlorine tester on the bench as well.]

Treatment plant woman [voice-over]: Or using equipment that measures the FAC by the amount of colour produced when a reagent is added to the water.

[The woman slots the test tube in a free slot in the chlorine tester, so that she can compare the colour of two samples.]

Treatment plant woman: This is very similar to the method used for testing the chlorine in a swimming pool or spa pool, but much more accurate. They are pretty easy tests to do.

[The location changes to outside a building, with a small cupboard on the wall. There is a risk management plan hanging beside it, with headings like 'What could go wrong?' 'Indications' and 'Plan of action' on it.]

Risk management man: It's important to store any reagents used to do test kits according to their instructions. They need to be kept in a dark, cool place. [He indicates the cupboard.] The reagents will have a use-by date and it's important to check this, because out-of-date reagents can give an inaccurate result. So you need to throw all old reagents away.

[Shot of the open cupboard. It has some boxes and empty sample bottles inside. The man puts a box labelled 'Test kit' on one of the shelves.]

Risk management man [voice-over]: Test kits also need to be checked from time to time to make sure they're accurate. This is called calibration.

[The location changes to a treatment building. The woman who was sampling the stream stands next to some pipes.]

Stream sampler: When you get an FAC test result you need to understand and interpret it. Most likely it will confirm to you that everything is ok. But if it is high, you might need to reduce the amount of chlorine you are adding. Or if it is low, you may need to increase the amount.

Testing for FAC gives you the information you need to adjust the dose. But remember, the test is for the chlorine that is available as a disinfectant after some has been combined with organic matter, not the actual dosage amount of chlorine. The FAC should ideally be greater than 0.2 milligrams per litre of water to make sure you have enough disinfectant to control bacteria and viruses. 3 milligrams per litre of water is too high and the water will taste pretty bad.

[The location changes to an office, where a man sits at a computer.]

pH man: pH is a measurement of the acidity of water. It's measured on a scale of 1 to 14.

[He brings up a pH chart on the computer. It goes from acid (1) to alkaline (14), with battery acid marked in at 4 and caustic soda at 14.]

pH man [voice-over]: 7 is neutral, lower than 7 is acidic and greater than 7 is alkaline. Ideally, water suppliers should try to keep drinking water at a pH level of between 7 and 8 [an arrow points to this on the screen].

The level of pH is important in chlorinated supplies because a high pH reduces the effectiveness of chlorine. But if the pH is too low, the water can leech metals from plumbing fittings, which can be a health risk over time. So keeping the pH constant at about 7 is important for water suppliers.

[The location changes to a sheep farm. A man stands next to a fenced-off pipe.]

Groundwater man: Well, in New Zealand groundwaters often have a low pH of about 6 or 6.5. This is because the groundwater can have a high CO content [CO = carbon dioxide]. The pH can be increased by aerating the water – blowing bubbles through it or tricking it over a rough surface. Aeration removes CO from the water, increasing the pH.

Another way to increase the pH is to add lime or soda ash to the water. Sometimes the pH can be too high. This can be caused by the water flowing through or over limestone. The water picks up the calcium from the limestone and this increases the alkalinity.

[The location changes to an orchard, where a woman has been picking peaches.]

Peach picker: In some source waters, the pH is very constant and it doesn't change much at all over time. Groundwater that comes from a bore which is not affected by surface run-off generally has a constant pH. But if the water comes from a shallow bore, the pH of the water may change every time it rains. And surface waters have pH that sometimes changes quite rapidly. Mostly, New Zealand source waters have a low pH.

[The location changes to some fenced-off water tanks. The woman from the treatment plant kneels next to the tanks with her testing equipment.]

Treatment plant woman: You can test pH with a similar kit to the chlorine test kits. [She adds a drop of liquid to the water in a test tube, and the water changes to pink.] A reagent is added to the water [the tube is added to a pH tester so that its colour can be compared to the example] and the change in colour is compared with a colour chart.

Treatment plant woman [voice-over]: You can also get an electronic analyser with a probe that you put in the water, and it gives a digital read-out.

Treatment plant woman: Just like FAC testing, the sample needs to be testing in the field just after being taken because sunlight and time affect the result.

[The location changes to a treatment plant. A man stands next to some canisters with 'Danger: chlorine' printed on them.]

Treatment plant man: If pH tests show that the water doesn't change you can reduce the pH tests to as low as 1 a year. But if the pH of the water changes, you need to test it to get an idea of what the range of variation is and what causes the changes. If you're using chlorine you need to monitor the pH to ensure the chlorine continues to be effective.

[The location changes to a car. The man who was describing how to store reagents is driving through the bush.]

Risk management man: The temperature of water can be important in treatment processes and sampling. Microbiological samples need to be analysed as soon after they have been collected as possible – within 6 hours. While they're being transported to a lab, you need to make sure they don't get too warm, or any bacteria in the sample may multiply. The best thing is to try and keep the sample at the same temperature it was when it was collected, or a little cooler.

[Shot of a little chilly bin on the backseat.]

It's good to carry the samples in a chilly bin with a cool pad in it. This should keep the temperature between about 4 and 10 degrees.

[The location changes to outside a shed. The lake-side sampler and the young woman from the office meeting and the man from the lake pier stand together.]

Lake-side sampler: In some water treatment processes temperature can be important. So if the water is too cold, the process happens very slowly. What it means – what it may mean is that in winter, when the water is colder, the flow rate through the filter may need to be slower. And chemical reactions, they're affected by temperature as well. They go faster when the water is warmer.

[The location changes to a water treatment plant.]

Young treatment plant woman: In water treatment plants using UV or chlorine to disinfect the water, dosages may need to be adjusted according to the temperature of the water. In warmer water the disinfection becomes more effective and in colder water it's less effective. And with chlorine the temperature could also affect the contact time that's required. So the most important thing about water temperature is to know what it is at different times of the year so you can understand how it might affect your treatment processes.

[The location changes back to the stream with a bridge over it. The man from the sheep farm, is doing some sampling there. He holds a thermometer and a cup.]

Groundwater man: When you're testing the temperature of source water or water in a water treatment plant, it's best not to put the thermometer into the actual water. If you're using a thermometer and it breaks, it'll release mercury into the water. But also, if you're using a temperature probe, you want the water to be still, not flowing.

The best thing to do is to take a small amount of water into a container and test this. [He puts the thermometer into the cup.]

[The location changes to thw water tank. A man stands outside with a sample bottle and a portable turbidity meter.]

Turbidity sampling man: A turbidity test tells you how dirty the water is, that is, how much suspended material is in the water. It's measured in units called nephelometric turbidity units or NTUs.

This analysis can be done with a portable turbidy meter. [He puts the water sample into the turbidity meter.]

To test turbidity, you take a sample of the water and put it into the turbidity meter. The instrument measures the turbidity by shining a beam of light through the water and measuring the intensity of light that passes through.

[The location changes to a stream. A woman holds several sample bottles.]

Turbidity sampling woman: These instruments are pretty sensitive. They measure differences in turbidity that you couldn't see with the naked eye. For example, by looking at a number of different samples, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between 10, 1 and 0.1 NTU. But 0.1 NTU would be very good turbidity for drinking water. 1 NTU would be only just good enough, and 10 NTU would be considered unacceptable.

A normal clean-looking river would be about 10 NTU [the stream gets higher and turns brown] but a dirty river in flood could be up to 5000 NTU.

[The location changes to a laboratory, where an older man stands. He has a German accent.]

German man: It's difficult water for protozoa, so turbidity is often used as a substitute for protozoa testing. The idea is that if the water has low turbidity, say less than 0.5 NTU, there is very little risk that it will contain protozoa cysts. The more turbidity, the more chance of protozoa.

[Back to the shed, where the lake-side sampler is now by himself.]

Lake-side sampler: Measuring turbidity is a good way of knowing how well your treatment system is working, because it tells you how clean the treated water is. Some water supplies actually automatically turn off and alert and operator if the turbidity of the treated water gets over a certain amount.

[The location changes to another laboratory. An older woman has her turbidity meter and other measuring instruments plugged in to the wall.]

Older woman: The instruments used to measure the water quality, like any other equipment in a water supply, need to be maintained on a regular basis, otherwise they could give incorrect information about the quality of the water. The instruments need to be calibrated from time to time.

Calibration is the process of comparing the results the instrument is giving to a known value, a reference standard or a laboratory test.

[Back to a water treatment building, where the man ho was out testing turbidity and the younger female lab worker in a water treatment building are holding testing instruments.]

Turbidity sampling man: For example, to test if an FAC test kit is still accurate, we could ask someone from a laboratory to come out to the treatment plant and test a sample at the same time we take a sample. We can then compare results.

If our instrument is not reading the same as the lab sample, we can then make a change to the instrument. Another option could be to send the instrument away to a lab or the instrument supplier for calibration.

[Back to the lab with the older woman.]

Older woman: How often you need to calibrate each instrument will be outlined in the instrument manufacturer's instructions. However, if your instrument has been identified in your PHRMP [water safety plan] as being critical, then you may wish to do the calibration more often.

[The location changes to a computer lab, where a man and a woman sit together.]

Computer lab man: Telemetry means to measure from a distance. So telemetry is an electronic system which monitors the apparatus at the water treatment plant and lets the supplier know what is going on at the plant without them having to travel to the plant.

Telemetry usually uses something like a wireless system or the cellular network to let the supplier know if their turbidity is too high, or if their FAC is too low, or other information like that.

[The location changes to an office, where a man sits. He has an American accent.]

American man: A slightly more advanced usage of it is to give you early warning of something that's going wrong. For instance if you're going to run out of water, it would be nice to know about it before some irate person calls you up and says, 'I've turned the tap on and nothing's on.'

[Back to the kitchen. The lake-side sampler and the young woman from the water treatment plant stand together.]

Lake-side sampler: You can get information about just about anything using telemetry. It's just a case of connecting the instruments, like a turbidity meter, up to the system.

Younger treatment plant woman: Yeah, but you need to think about how much information you need. Like do you want to know if the turbidity is over a certain level, or exactly how high it is?

Lake-side sampler: And do you need to know just that the UV system is not working, or do you need to know the level of transmittance?

Younger treatment plant woman: What about for small drinking water supplies?

Lake-side sampler: Well, probably the most helpful use of telemetry is to just have a simple alarm to let you know that something's gone wrong.

Younger treatment plant woman: That's right. And if you set up the treatment plant so that it shuts down if the chlorine runs out, or the turbidity gets too high, then a pager can let you know that there's a problem.

Lake-side sampler: Yeah. And then you can just run down to the treatment plant and see what's going on.

Younger treatment plant woman: And if you've got enough storage then you can keep supplying water while you get things fixed.

Computer lab woman: The water supplier needs to have a system for their particular situation, and a system to give them the type of information that they need. For small suppliers, a simple alarm to let the person responsible know if something has gone wrong can be very helpful, and make sure that they don't provide water that's not safe to drink.

[Back to the skifield, where the man from the start of the video is standing with a drink.]

Skifield man: If you are responsible for the supply of safe water, it's essential that you know what is happening in your water catchment area, in your treatment plant and in your reticulation system. If, for example, heavy rain adversely affects the turbidity of your water, your UV system may not be able to operate to its capacity and pathogens may be getting through the treatment plant and into your reticulation system.

In other words, the small provider – no less than the large treatment plant – needs to have quality control. And for quality control, the water supplier needs to know what is happening at each stage of water collection, water treatment and water distribution. This means that the water supply needs to be monitored at all stages from source, to treatment, to tap supply.",mainstream
618,"Sky climbers seem ubiquitous. They top Everest, Denali, Kilimanjaro, anything with a peak, and then prattle on about it forever. Yawn.

Trade in the ice, frostbite and oxygen deprivation, bold travelers, for more elemental experiences, with bizarre histories, desert bandits, bubbling fires, searing heat, deadly chemicals, eerie shapes and strange life, as well as therapeutic waters, mild climates and tempting fruits.

For all these thrills, look down, not up, and descend into the 10 lowest terrestrial elevations on the planet.

The Earth's lowest point, one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, is colorful and surreal.

Its turquoise waters, which occasionally flash bright red in the rainy season due to algal blooms, have drawn wellness tourists as early as King Herod, attracted to the therapeutic mineral waters, low allergens, high atmospheric pressure and reduced solar radiation.

Yes, the Dead Sea harbors life. Fish can't survive, but bacteria and algae can, as well as 80 species of fungi that thrive near freshwater springs at the bottom. Visitors who immerse themselves quickly pop to the surface and easily float, as the sea is almost nine times saltier than the ocean.

Also known as Lake Tiberias, Kinnereth or Kinneret, the lowest freshwater lake in the world has numerous hot springs, which supply the mineral baths and spas of beachfront winter health resorts, including in Tiberias, a settlement that dates back to antiquity, as noted by the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus in the first century.

Attracted to its pleasant climate, fertile soil and abundant water, humans settled along the shores some 400,000 years ago. Today, farmers cultivate dates, vegetables and citrus fruits. Fishermen haul in sardines, catfish and Galilean tilapia.

And pilgrims follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ, who preached the Sermon on the Mount overlooking the sea.

This crater lake in a dormant desert volcano resides in what seems a welcoming place. From a distance, its sparking turquoise waters and bright white beaches invite. But to reach it, one must pass a lake known as the Pit of Demons and a strange looking volcanic neck.

Assal is salty, 10 times more than the ocean, which leaves an oily residue on those who go in. And its ""sandy"" stretches turn out to be jagged shards of salt, which bristle and inflame the skin.

Why do a day trip from the capital? The countryside is, as some local tourism pros say, Djiboutiful, with stunning limestone smokestacks and petrified forests.

Avoid high summer when the temps top 125 Fahrenheit. Go November to January when the weather cools, and whale sharks make their annual visit in the nearby Red Sea.

The bottom of China's deepest depression, translated from the Uyghur language as Moonlight Lake, a lunar-shaped body in the Xinjiang autonomous region, consists of three concentric regions: the outer a flood plain, where industrious Chinese harvest gypsum and rock salt; the middle a salt marsh, home of the occasional hare, mouse and migratory waterfowl; and the center, a core of pure white salt crystals.

Given the stark desolation and proximity to the aptly named sandstone Flaming Mountains, a thousand hidden Buddhist missionary caves, and one of China's most renowned grape growing regions, Lake Ayding attracts the curious from China and abroad, who take buses from the nearby city of Turpan.

The name of this giant sinkhole in northwest Egypt means ""dripping"" in Arabic, a reference to the few but vital oases that speck the desert landscape.

Some provide habitat for rare cheetahs on the hunt for gazelles, grazing among thorny acacia groves. One, the Qara Oasis, shelters its only permanent settlement, composed of a few hundred Bedouin cattle breeders.

Jackals, foxes and wild sheep roam Qattara, a 7,500 square mile lowland that resembles a giant footprint noted too for its fantastical rocks and black dunes.

Its squishy interior helped Allied troops defeat German tanks in World War II. Later, President Eisenhower offered peaceful nukes to blast a tunnel to the depression to create a massive hydroelectric lake. Cairo declined, thankfully for seekers of this scenic low point, who can choose from many tour operators in the capital city to reach it.

Created from the collapse of limestone caverns near the Caspian Sea, this enigmatic trough features a river that gushes from a subterranean spring and disappears into a hole, and weirdly eroded grottoes, gullies and rock funnels.

Strangely, due to its odd geology and hydrology, it creates its own rain clouds overhead. Also found in the air, plenty of vultures.

One of the most dangerous places on Earth, this hellish volcanic landscape vents sulfuric acid, belches poisonous gases, oozes hot oil and wafts toxic hot air.

Naturally, one can now book tours to explore this deep hot spot, created by the divergence of three tectonic plates.

Camel caravans, which traditionally venture here to tap the vast salt deposits, now bring along brave visitors. The payoff? A hauntingly beautiful world of phantasmal shapes and glowing lakes, made of neon greens, yellows, blues and oranges.

If you want to go to Mars but can't wait for Elon Musk to finish his rocket, this trip is a good alternative.

The so-called ""Coal Lake"" is easy enough to reach, a 30-mile drive from the Patagonian city of Puerto San Julian, but hosts perhaps the fewest visitors of the low 10 due to its obscurity.

Scientists didn't measure its elevation until a few decades ago, when it dethroned Death Valley as the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere. Depression seekers have bagged it in rented all-terrain vehicles after getting permission from the owner to pass the gates to the private property, which besides a lagoon steeped in carbon deposits includes salt marshes, strange salt formations, barren mountains and loads of dinosaur fossils.

Lost 49ers took a deadly turn in its depth. Twenty mule teams braved its canyons. Radio host Ronald Reagan chronicled its Wild West adventures.

One of the most storied places in California, the infamous valley terminates in Badwater Basin, which holds a salt lake seemingly devoid of life. Actually, it hosts plenty of pickleweed, insects and tiny snails.

The sight is impressive, with the nearby salt flat crusted into hexagonal honeycombs and the Panamint Mountains jutting up more than 10,000 feet.

Be mindful of military jets and test cars, which zoom through the valley to test themselves in the high atmospheric pressure.

But the featured attraction is nearby Darvaza crater, or Door to Hell, a gas field that collapsed into a giant pit in the 1960s, taking along with it a drilling rig and camp. Fearing deadly methane buildups, geologists lit it on fire.

They expected the blaze to last a few weeks, but it remains a glowing pit of orange flames and simmering mud to this day.

A National Geographic explorer found extremophile life forms in its bottom. And a Godzilla film publicity shot featured the crater. You can tour both spots, natural craters filled with (unlit) liquid gas, and camp overnight in the desert if you wish with local guides.

263,"They hate us because of our freedoms.” Who will ever forget this previous statement by one of the “intellectual giants” of our time, George W. Bush? Was George correct about the freedoms that Americans possess which would cause someone to do us harm out of envy?

On the surface, we appear to have a lot to celebrate. Before every sporting event, the National Anthem is played. Before public meetings and before most schools commence their daily instruction,the Pledge of Allegiance is frequently recited. On the surface, Americans appear to have much to be thankful for with regard to the degree of freedom and the amount of opportunities available to us. In general, we just seem to be the happiest people on the face of the earth. However, the data tells a much different story.

The United States is a nation in severe decline and it is beginning to show up in our mental health which is a reflection of the troubled political and economic times that we find ourselves in.

In 2013, over 9.3 million Americans had serious thoughts of suicide during that year. During that same year, 43.8 million adults (age 18 or older) experienced a diagnosable mental illness as 2.7 million (1.1%) made suicide plans and 1.3 million (0.6%) attempted suicide.

“The report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) also finds that 10 million adults experienced a serious mental illness and 15.7 million adults experienced a major depressive episode in 2013″. These results continued the same trend as was found in 2012, when the findings reached astronomical levels.

In 2013, major depressive episodes affected approximately one in ten (2.6 million) youth between the ages of 12 to 17. However, Americans do not get consistent treatment with only 38.1 percent of depressed youths receive treatment for serious clinical depression. The SAMSHA Report found that, approximately 34.6 million adults (this represents 14.6% of all American adults) received mental health care. These numbers are significantly escalated over the period covering 2002-2011. According to the new report, 44.7% of adults with any mental illness and 68.5 percent of adults with serious mental illness received mental health services.

The numbera listed above are indeed grim. The rate of mental illness is growing in lockstep with our failed economy. There is a definite correlation between the growing rate of mental illness and our obvious failures as a country. Over 20% of Americans have a diagnosable mental illness. Anywhere from 35-40% are receiving no treatment. This means that when the economy collapses, millions of displaced people with a significant mental illness will greatly exacerbate the coming civil unrest.

There is now evidence that Americans are far more mentally ill than our foreign counterparts.

According to a presentation offered at the IFPE Congress in Vienna, Austria on April 18, 2010, on the results of World Health Organization’s World Mental Health Survey, 19% of studied Americans experienced a clinical anxiety disorder in the previous twelve-month period, which pushes the United States into a ranking of first place in this category.

What do Americans have to be so nervous about? At least part of the answer which explains why Americans have such a high degree of clinical anxiety, is contained in the following paragraphs as it is undeniably stressful living in America under the present set of conditions.

The United States is a nation in decline. Last year the U.S. came in 10th place in the annual rankings of World’s Happiest Countries. This year America has fallen to 12th. And this is in a country which historically believed that the next generation would do better than their parents. That is certainly no longer the case. This marks the first time in the history of the Legatum Institute‘s Prosperity Index that America has not placed in the top ten.

Most disturbingly in the period from 1968 to 2008, the suicide rate in America rose 308% for people aged 15 to 24. It is clear that our children do not want to live in the conditions arising from our New World Order.

These rising mental health calamities reflect the social, political and economic attacks that we are enduring at the hands of the globalists.

According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index 2011, the United States is tied with Romania for forty-ninth in civil liberties. Several countries such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Norway are tied for first.

Secretly disappearing people under the NDAA, executing three American citizens with drones, and unbridled, Fourth Amendment violating spy activities will put a country on par with Romania with regard to civil liberties.

We have also lost Habeus Corpus and we are losing our free speech rights to the United Nations as well as every form of due process that we once cherished under our Constitution. And if you don’t like the unfolding criminal enterprise system which suddenly appeared before our collective eyes, the bankers have rolled out a technocratic police state which would make Stalin and Hitler envious. Both the police state and impending martial law are bolstered by the fact that the Department of Homeland Security has purchased 1.6 billion rounds, oops, make that 2.2 billion rounds of high tech bullets engraved with the names of citizens who dare to oppose this tyranny.

Can one only imagine how far America’s civil liberties rating would have fallen if Obamacare’s most dastardly provisions were known to the pollsters?

There are many figures which illustrate why Americans are justified in being so bearish on the American economy. However, when we can point to the fact that the average citizen in India and China can accurately state that they think that it is a good time to find a job is 40% and 36%, respectively, yet, in the U.S. and U.K., those percentages are, respectively, 26% and 12%, it speaks to the abysmal set of financial conditions in the United States. This directly impacts our collective levels of resilience and optimism.

The Common Sense Show exists because there is very little freedom of the press. Today, six corporations control most everything you hear, read and watch.

One would think that the First Amendment to the Constitution would protect the freedom of the press. There was a recent time when the United States was previously ranked 20th in the freedom of the press, but the US has fallen 27 places to the 49th place. One of the reasons listed for the decline are the many arrests of journalists covering Occupy Wall Street protests. Certainly, the Occupy Wall Street arrests had a lot to do with the slippage.

The US is now ranked lower then most western European countries including Finland, Norway, Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, Belgium, UK, France, Spain, etc. The Europeans scoff at our notion of the freedom of the press.

Do you remember former award-winning CNN journalist, Amber Lyon, who quit the network in order to maintain her journalistic integrity as she alleged that CNN was receiving payment from the government to cover, and not cover, certain stories.

By the way, can we only imagine how far the freedom of the press ratings would have fallen if the murders of Andrew Breitbart and Michael Hastings were taken into account?

The Education Policy Institute assessed the affordability of higher education costs and found that the United States ranks 13th in higher education affordability.

To those who think your children can borrow their way to a degree, think again. Today’s U.S. college loan practices, which serve to underwrite much of the cost of a college education, are the most predatory in the world. As of 2012-13, bankruptcy cannot cancel out a student loan debt and delinquent college students can now go to jail for nonpayment. Nowhere else in the world can we find evidence of these types of predatory practices being used against college students as we do here in the United States.

America used be thought of as the land of opportunity. The truth is that America should be labeled the land of declining opportunity.

First and foremost, Americans no longer live in the highest salary paying country in the world. In fact, the United States does not even crack the top ten list of the highest salary paying countries on the planet in which Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Japan, Norway, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom round out the top ten and pay their workers more than workers in the United States. In fact, the United States only ranks 20th in terms of overall gross pay! One would be very naive to call America the land of opportunity. Instead, America is the land of predatory corporations and banks which have hijacked our government for their own benefit at the expense of the American people. As a result, poverty rates among children have reached 25%.

Our education is overpriced, our earning power is substandard, our tax rates are exorbitant and we increasingly live in a rapidly emerging police state. But at least we have our health. Unfortunately, that is not quite true as the United States spends more than the next 12 nations for health care. However, it seems as if we are spending more and enjoying it less as, despite our exorbitant spending on health care, the United States ranks 51st in the world in life expectancy. Cuba, Puerto Rico and Spain have higher life expectancies than the United States. Americans live in the only country in the world where its citizens cannot bargain shop for its medicines in foreign countries because the pharmaceuticals have convinced congress to establish a pharmaceutical monopoly over U.S. citizens. Voice over talent, Jonathan Lockwood has relocated to San Miguel, Mexico. Mr. Lockwood will be able to purchase INTERNATIONAL health insurance for $150 per month. In the United States, international health care insurance is not permitted by the criminal government who is maintaining a mafia-type protection racket for the managed health care companies. “Death by doctor” has increased to 225,000 patients deaths per year due to gross negligence. No wonder we are the most anxious country in the world!

And with Obamacare death panels looming on the near horizon, things can only get worse.

You Can’t Run and You Can’t Hide

When you have decided you have had enough and try and leave America, your will be assessed a 15% exit fee by our governmental mafia on your financial assets. Yes, that is correct, you are penalized for exercising the privilege of leaving the country. Do you remember as children that we were taught to make fun of the Soviet Union for building fences to keep their citizens in? By the way, Russia now has a flat 13% tax rate. And of course, if you relocate, you must now pay taxes to your new country as well as the United States, thus making the citizens of the United States the only people in the world that have to pay income tax to more than one country.

No Mr. Bush, the world does not hate us because we have freedom. The world hates America because our government is murdering millions of innocent people and depriving millions more of their freedom much in the same manner as our government is depriving freedom of American citizens in our own country. Increasingly, America hates itself because of the circumstances we presently find ourselves in and our poor mental health is a direct reflection of the self-loathing. And speaking of freedom, the United States has the largest prison population in the world. Prison is a breeding ground for emerging mental illness.

The moral depravity of our leaders knows no bounds and this is why the world hates America with such a passion and in the meantime Americans are withering on the vine. Of course there is one solution today that the government cannot take from you. But given the fact that this is an NFL playoff Sunday, I won’t burden you with that option on this holy Sunday.

It didn’t take long from the birth of the world wide web for the public to start using this new medium to transmit, collect and analyze information in ways never before imagined. The first message boards and clunky “Web 1.0” websites soon gave way to “the blogosphere.” The arrival of social media was the next step in this evolution, allowing for the formation of communities of interest to share information in real time about events happening anywhere on the globe.

But as quickly as communities began to form around these new platforms, governments and militaries were even quicker in recognizing the potential to use this new medium to more effectively spread their own propaganda.

Their goal? To shape public discourse around global events in a way favourable to their standing military and geopolitical objectives.

Their method? The Weaponization of Social Media.

This is The Corbett Report.

Facebook. Twitter. YouTube. Snapchat. Instagram. Reddit. “Social media” as we know it today barely existed fifteen years ago. Although it provides new ways to interact with people and information from all across the planet virtually instantaneously and virtually for free, we are only now beginning to understand the depths of the problems associated with these new platforms. More and more of the original developers of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter admit they no longer use social media themselves and actively keep it away from their children, and now they are finally admitting the reason why: social media was designed specifically to take advantage of your psychological weaknesses and keep you addicted to your screen.

SEAN PARKER: If the thought process that went into building these applications—Facebook being the first of them to really understand it—that thought process was all about “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?” And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever, and that’s gonna get you to contribute more content and that’s gonna get you more likes and comments. So it’s a social validation feedback loop. I mean it’s exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. And I think that we—the inventors/creators, you know, it’s me, it’s Mark, it’s Kevin Systrom at Instagram, it’s all of these people—understood this consciously and we did it anyway.

It should be no surprise, then, that in this world of social media addicts and smartphone zombies, the 24/7 newsfeed is taking up a greater and greater share of people’s lives. Our thoughts, our opinions, our knowledge of the world, even our mood are increasingly being influenced or even determined by what we see being posted, tweeted or vlogged. And the process by which these media shape our opinions is being carefully monitored and analyzed, not by the social media companies themselves, but by the US military.

MARINA PORTNAYA: When the world’s largest social media platform betrays its users, there’s going to be outrage. ABC HOST: The study to see whether Facebook could influence the emotional state of its users on that news feed. CNN ANCHOR: It allowed researchers to manipulate almost 700,000 users’ news feeds. Some saw more positive news about their friends, others saw more negative. CNN GUEST: Well I’m not surprised. I mean we’re all kind of lab rat than the big Facebook experiment. PORTNAYA: But it wasn’t only Facebook’s experiment. It turns out the psychological study was connected to the US government’s research on social unrest. MORNING JOE GUEST: This is really kind of creepy. PORTNAYA: And it gets worse. What you may not know is that the US Department of Defense has reportedly spent roughly $20 million conducting studies aimed at learning how to manipulate online behavior in order to influence opinion. The initiative was launched in 2011 by the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, otherwise known as DARPA. The program is best described as the US media’s effort to become better at detecting and conducting propaganda campaigns via social media. Translation: When anti-government messages gain ground virally, Washington wants to find a way to spread counter opinion.

The DARPA document that details the Pentagon’s plans for influencing opinions in the social media space is called “Social Media in Strategic Communication.” DARPA’s goal, according to their own website, is “to develop tools to help identify misinformation or deception campaigns and counter them with truthful information.”

Exactly what tools were developed for this purpose and how they are currently being deployed is unclear. But Rand Walzman, the program’s creator, admitted last year that the project lasted four years, cost $50 million and led to the publication of over 200 papers. The papers, including “Incorporating Human Cognitive Biases in a Probabilistic Model of Retweeting,” “Structural Properties of Ego Networks,” and “Sentiment Prediction using Collaborative Filtering,” make the thrust of the program perfectly clear. Social media users are lab rats being carefully scrutinized by government-supported researchers, their tweets and Facebook posts and Instagram pictures being analyzed to determine how information spreads online, and, by implication, how the government and the military can use these social media networks to make their own propaganda “go viral.”

As worrying as this research is, it pales in comparison to the knowledge that governments, militaries and political lobby groups are already employing squadrons of foot soldiers to wage information warfare in the social media battlespace.

CTV ANCHOR: So is it okay to have the government monitor social media conversations and then to wade in and correct some of those conversations? With more on this, let’s go to technology expert Carmi Levy. He’s on the line from Montreal. Carmi, do you think the government’s monitoring what you and I are saying right now? Is this whole thing getting out of line, or what? CARMI LEVY: It opens up a bit of a question. I’d like to call it a Pandora’s box about, you know, what exactly is the government’s aim here, and what do they hope to accomplish with what they find out? And as they accumulate this information online—this data on us—where does that data go? And so I think as much as we should applaud the government for getting into this area, the optics of it are potentially very Big Brother-ish. And the government really does need to be a little bit more concrete on what its intentions are and how it intends to achieve them.

4WWL REPORTER: New evidence that government-owned computers at the Army Corps of Engineers office here in New Orleans are being used to verbally attack critics of the Corps comes in an affidavit from the former editor-in-chief of nola.com. Jon Donley, who was laid off this past February, tells us via satellite from Texas, in late 2006 he started noticing people presenting themselves as ordinary citizens defending the Corps very energetically. JON DONLEY: What stuck out, though, was the wording of the comments was in many ways mirroring news releases from the Corps of Engineers. SANDY ROSENTHAL: These commenters tried to discredit these people . . . 4WWL REPORTER: And when Rosenthal investigated, she discovered the comments were coming from users at the internet provider address of the Army Corps of Engineers offices here in New Orleans. She blamed the Corps for a strategy of going after critics. ROSENTHAL: In the process of trying to obscure the facts of the New Orleans floodings, one of their tactics was just verbal abuse.

These operations are only the visible and publicly-admitted front of a vast array of military and intelligence programs that are attempting to influence online behaviour, spread government propaganda, and disrupt online communities that arise in opposition to their agenda.

That such programs exist is not a matter of conjecture; it is mundane, established, documented fact.

In 2014, an internal document was leaked from GCHQ, the British equivalent of the NSA. The document, never intended for public release, was entitled “The Art of Deception: Training for a New Generation of Online Covert Operations” and bluntly stated that “We want to build Cyber Magicians.” It then goes on to outline the “magic” techniques that must be employed in influence and information operations online, including deception and manipulation techniques like “anchoring,” “priming” and “branding” propaganda narratives. After presenting a map of social networking technologies that are targeted by these operations, the document then instructs the “magicians” how to deceive the public through “attention management” and behavioural manipulation.

That governments would turn to these strategies is hardly a shocking development. In fact, the use of government shills to propagate government talking points and disrupt online dissent has been openly advocated on the record by high-ranking government officials for the past decade.

In 2008, Cass Sunstein, a law professor who would go on to become Obama’s information “czar,” co-authored a paper entitled “Conspiracy Theories,” in which he wrote that the “best response” to online “conspiracy theories” is what he calls “cognitive infiltration” of groups spreading these ideas.

It is perhaps particularly ironic that the idea that government agents are actually and admittedly spreading propaganda online under false identities is, to the less-informed members of the population, itself a “conspiracy theory” rather than an established conspiracy fact.

Unsurprisingly, when confronted about his proposal, Sunstein pretended to not remember having written it and then pointedly refused to answer any questions about it.

Now, a decade on from Sunstein’s proposal, we know that military psyops agents, political lobbyists, corporate shills and government propagandists are spending vast sums of money and employing entire armies of keyboard warriors, leaving comments and shaping conversations to change the public’s opinions, influence their behaviour, and even alter their mood. And they are helped along in this quest by the very same technology that allows the public to connect on a scale never before possible.

Technology is always a double-edged sword, and sometimes it can be dangerous to wield that sword at all. There are ways to identify and neutralize the threat of online trolls and shills, but the phenomenon is not likely to go away any time soon.

Each of us must find our own answer to the question of how best to incorporate these technologies into our life. But the next time you find yourself caught up in an argument with an online persona that may or may not be a genuine human being, it might be better to ask yourself if your efforts are better spent engaging in the argument or just turning off the computer.",conspiracy
473,"Over-The-Counter Natural Cures

 by The Peoples Chemist, Shane Ellison, M.S.

 A former chemist for Big Pharma tells how drugs are highly toxic and, in many cases, cause greater illness than they alleviate. But the nutritional supplements sold in health-food stores also are manufactured by pharmaceutical companies and are not the natural products we assume they are. Synthetic vitamins may be chemically similar to those in nature but they are devoid of the co-factors found in the natural state, and that means that vitamins in a pill are far less effective than in foods and herbs. This led Ellison to examine thousands of natural sources, to identify those that are loaded with complete nutrition. In the process, he found some that can produce astounding reversals of such chronic diseases as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer  all for under $10 for a 30-day supply. This book could save you thousands of dollars and may even save your life. (More)

 WORLD WITHOUT CANCER 

 The Story of Vitamin B17

 G. Edward Griffin.

 marshals evidence that cancer is a deficiency disease, like scurvy or pellagra, caused by the lack of an essential food factor in modern mans diet. That substance is vitamin B17. In its purified form developed for cancer therapy, it is known as Laetrile. This story is not approved by orthodox medicine. The FDA, the AMA, and The American Cancer Society have labeled it fraud and quackery. Yet the evidence is clear that here, at last, is the final answer to the cancer riddle. Why has orthodox medicine waged war against this non drug approach? The author contends that the answer is to be found, not in science, but in politicsand is based upon the hidden economic and power agenda of those who dominate the medical establishment. This is is the most complete and authoritative treatise available on this topic. (More)

 The Testimony of Yuri Bezmenov, KGB Propagandist

 Yuri Bezmenov, the son of a high-ranking Soviet officer, was a member of the elite propaganda arm of the KGB, known as the Novasti Press Agency.

Biden began to change his account in 2013, telling the New York Times he told Obama to “follow your instincts,” and then told him “Go” the next morning. He repeated this changed account in 2015, claiming that he privately told Obama to go ahead.

On Friday, Biden doubled down on his lie during a brief exchange with Fox News:

“As commander in chief, if you were ever handed a piece of intelligence that said you could stop an imminent attack on Americans — but you have to use an airstrike to take out a terrorist leader — would you pull the trigger?” Biden was asked.

To which Biden replied “Well we did – the guy’s name was Osama bin Laden.”

“Didn’t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden that day?” Fox followed up.

On Friday, the Republican National Committee (RNC) slammed Biden over Friday’s claim, according to Fox News.

“This isn’t another instance of Joe Biden misspeaking, it’s an instance of Biden flat-out lying,” said spokesman Steve Guest.

1160,"From sea shells and spiral galaxies to the structure of human lungs, the patterns of chaos are all around us. Fractals are patterns formed from chaotic equations and contain self-similar patterns of complexity increasing with magnification. If you divide a fractal pattern into parts you get a nearly identical reduced-size copy of the whole. The mathematical beauty of fractals is that infinite complexity is formed with relatively simple equations. By iterating or repeating fractal-generating equations many times, random outputs create beautiful patterns that are unique, yet recognizable. We have pulled together some of the most stunning natural examples we could find of fractals on our planet. Above: This variant form of cauliflower is the ultimate fractal vegetable. Its pattern is a natural representation of the Fibonacci or golden spiral, a logarithmic spiral where every quarter turn is farther from the origin by a factor of phi, the golden ratio.

The San Francisco Bay salt flats pictured above have been used for commercial salt production for over a century.

Extinct for 65 million years, ammonites were marine cephalopods that built chambered spiral shells. The walls between these chambers, called sutures, were complex fractal curves. Stephen Jay Gould used the complexity of ammonite sutures over time to argue that there is no evolutionary drive toward greater complexity and that we are a ""glorious accident,"" alone in the universe. The shells of ammonites also grow as a logarithmic spiral, a pattern that appears often in nature, as with romanesco broccoli. Ammonites also inspired this cathedral staircase in Barcelona, Spain.

Mountains are the result of tectonic forces pushing the crust upward and erosion tearing some of that crust down. The resulting pattern is a fractal.

Ferns are a common example of a self-similar set, meaning that their pattern can be mathematically generated and reproduced at any magnification or reduction. The mathematical formula that describes ferns, named after Michael Barnsley, was one of the first to show that chaos is inherently unpredictable yet generally follows deterministic rules based on nonlinear iterative equations. In other words, random numbers generated over and over using Barnsley's Fern formula ultimately produce a unique fern-shaped object. Images: 1) Flickr/cobalt123. 2) Flickr/CatDancing.

The marine stratus clouds above were photographed by the Aqua satellite over the South Atlantic Ocean, off the west coast of Africa. A fractal cloud pattern is interrupted by a series of diagonal grooves. According the NASA Earth Observatory, it is highly unusual to see such a sharp boundary in a continual cloud formation such as this, and scientists have yet to explain how it could form. Below, the 200-mile long series of cloud vortexes is perhaps the longest of these formations ever photographed, according to NASA. These cloud vortexes are also called von Kármán cloud streets, for the late fluid dynamicist Theodore von Kármán. Cloud streets form when low-lying clouds are interrupted by an object such as an island. Similar patterns occur in the wind flow downstream of airplane wings.

476,"Luc Besson’s Lucy is a movie about a woman who unlocked the full, 100% potential of her brain power instead of the 10% humans reportedly use. While many viewers were confused by the movie’s odd mix of pseudo-science and action scenes, the core of the movie lies in a whole other realm: It is about the Luciferian philosophy of the occult elite and its futuristic pendant, transhumanism.

Lucy is a science fiction movie that combines profound existential questions with a bunch of action scenes involving Asian gangsters. While this dichotomy wasn’t well-received by critics, there is an esoteric message hiding behind it all. Lucy is indeed more than a movie in which Scarlett Johanson being a “bad-a-s” – it is an allegorical tale celebrating the philosophy of the elite: Luciferianism.

The fact that the main character is named Lucy is the first clue hinting towards the philosophical basis of the movie. The name Lucy and Lucifer both derive from the Latin word “lux” which means “light”. Lucifer means “light-bringer” in Latin, and is considered by Luciferians to have brought divine knowledge (light) to humans after being cast out of heaven by God. In Luciferian circles, Lucifer is perceived as a “savior” who gave humans the knowledge necessary to ascend to divinity. In the movie, Lucy is a human version of Lucifer, as her increased brain capacity allows her to gain the knowledge required to become a god.

Going further than ancient Biblical tales, the movie is also labeled “transhumanist”, which is a modern, futuristic byproduct of Luciferian thought. Transhumanism is about humans reaching another level of development through man-made technology and robotics. To fully understand Lucy, we will need to look further into these two concepts.

“Luciferianism” is a word that is rarely used because the word “Lucifer” is associated with Satan in Judeo-Christian theology. It is nevertheless the philosophy that overwhelmingly prevails in the highest circles of society – what we call the occult elite. Interpreted in several forms, Luciferianism can be associated with philosophical currents such as humanism, Gnosticism, and Kabbalism and is the driving force behind secret societies such as the Rosicrucians, the Freemasons, and many others.

Luciferianism is about humans reaching divinity through human means. This philosophy is symbolically represented by two mythical figures who bear similar characteristics: Prometheus and Lucifer. Both of these figures are considered by some circles to be benefactors of humanity as they brought fire and light (representing divine knowledge) to struggling humans. They gave mankind the means to become gods themselves, through their own means.

From this perspective, Luciferians interpret Biblical tales from a unique vantage point. In Genesis, Luciferians consider the snake who gave Eve the forbidden apple to be a hero, as he is the one who brought humanity knowledge of good, evil and everything in between. The story of the tower of Babel, a human construction meant to reach God in the sky is viewed favorably by Luciferians as it represents humanity’s struggle to reach divinity; the building of this immense tower was, however, stopped by God who is perceived as a jealous demiurge who trapped humans in the physical world.

In the 20th century, a high-tech version of this philosophy appeared as transhumanism, a movement that seeks the use of science and robotics to push humanity to another stage of development. Transhumanism’s admitted ultimate goal is the total merging of humans and robots. While most people who agree with transhumanism probably do not know much about Luciferianism, one of its “founding fathers” clearly sees the connection.

The British philosopher Max More first articulated the principles of transhumanism as a futurist philosophy in 1990 and started a worldwide intelligencia to promote it. One of his essays, entitled “In Praise of the Devil” goes deep in a theological territory to connect transhumanism with Luciferianism.

According to More, Lucifer probably exiled himself out of moral outrage towards the oppressive demiurge Jehovah. He, therefore, describes the basis of Luciferian thought:

What does this all have to do with Lucy? Well, Lucy is about everything above. It is about humanity reaching divinity through knowledge, about using science and technology to break “biological barriers”.

Although all of this might sound positive, there is a troubling, dark side to it all: Only a select few can be “illuminated” by the light of Lucifer. The rest of humanity is perceived as a lesser race with lives of no value. For this reason, Lucy remorselessly kills a bunch of people, including many innocents. This is what Luciferian thought is truly about.

At the beginning of the movie, Lucy is a young woman who is clearly not a genius. She is manipulated by the douchebag she is dating to bring a suitcase to some person inside a hotel. She ends up getting mixed up in a high-stakes Asian mob deal – and she’s confused and panicky the entire time.

The mobsters end up turning Lucy into a drug mule. They insert into her body a packet of CPH4, a synthetic drug that is about to flood the European market. After receiving a kick in the stomach, the packet located inside Lucy breaks and her body absorbs the contents of the entire packet. This causes her brain to become increasingly powerful.

In the philosophical context of the movie, the fact that the drug is synthetic (which means that it was created by humans), is important as it ties in with the transhumanist philosophy of human evolution through science and technology.

Is there any scientific truth to Luc Besson’s premise? Here’s a part of an interview with Besson discussing the science behind Lucy.

While the scientific facts behind the movie are nebulous, the symbolic meaning of it all is not. While Lucy is in the process of transforming into a transhuman superhero, Professor Norman (played by Morgan Freeman) gives a presentation about the untapped power of the human brain. His speech quickly turns into an advertisement for transhumanism.

Professor Norman then says something that comes straight from a pamphlet for transhumanism :

In other words, humans need to reach another stage through technological and scientific advancement, not through natural evolution.

This is exactly what happens to Lucy. Along with acquiring a great amount of knowledge, Lucy develops extra-sensory perception (ESP) and is even able to control matter and other people. But one thing is terribly wrong: As soon as Lucy becomes smarter, she starts shooting and killing people. Why?

Someone once said: “It is not about how much knowledge you have, it is about what you do with it”. What did Lucy do when she became the most intelligent person on Earth? Did she cure cancer? Did she find a solution to world hunger? Did she invent an economic system that is fair and profitable for all countries on Earth? Nope. She grabbed a gun a started shooting Asian guys. Even worse, she goes on to cause pain and suffering of innocent people.

While killing those involved with her capture is somewhat understandable (although she probably did not need to kill everybody), the bloodshed does not end there. When she goes outside, she shoots a taxi driver in the leg because he did not immediately comply with her request. Later in the movie, Lucy drives like a crazy person and causes a ten-car pileup.

The pain Lucy causes is also psychological. When a doctor asks Lucy to prove her powers, she “enters” his brain and reminds him of the death of his daughter in specific detail. She could have told him about the color of his car, but why do that when you can talk about the most painful memory imaginable?

Lucy’s transformation takes a very specific direction and being a “good person” is not part of it. Her metamorphosis caused her to completely lack moral values, compassion, and consideration for other human beings. Apparently, being extremely intelligent turns you into an evil transhuman robot. Lucy herself says:

If one examines Lucy’s evolution, one realizes that she turns into exactly what the occult elite represents. She uses her powers to control people and to advance her aims despite the human suffering she is causing. She morphed into something that is not human and, all of a sudden, regular humans are treated by Lucy as lesser beings that are idiotic, manipulable and expandable.

Also, like the occult elite, she spends a LOT of time controlling and monitoring people’s electronic devices.

Like the occult elite, Lucy is not on a pure, noble mission for illumination. There is a dark side to her actions, and, apparently, since she’s the hero of the movie, it’s all good.

Towards the end of the movie, Lucy is less a human being than a divine being who sacrifices her terrestrial life to becoming nothing less than a god (I don’t use the term goddess because gods are neither male nor female). Lucy’s meeting with Dr. Norman at La Sorbonne University turns into a strange, high-tech, occult ritual where she transcends space and time to achieve divinity. During the entire ritual, lowly, idiot humans kill each other nearby in a flurry of gunshots.

The ultimate goal of Lucy’s transcendence is to pass on the knowledge she obtained, the same way two simple cells pass on their knowledge through time. However, according to Dr. Norman, this knowledge might be too powerful for mankind.

This is the thinking behind secret societies who “hide” their occult knowledge from the uninitiated behind several layers of symbolism (occult literally means “hidden”). The profane masses are considered too unworthy and primitive to deal with powerful knowledge. In short, Luciferians are extremely elitist.

Before completing her transformation, Lucy uses her powers to travel through space and time in order to visit various landmarks around the world. She ends up face to face with Lucy, ” the first human on Earth”.

In a symbolic gesture, Lucy points her finger towards the other Lucy.

The scene is, of course, a heavy-handed reference to Michelangelo’s mural where God creates Adam. The painting is also briefly shown earlier in the movie when Dr. Norman talks about humanity’s amazing accomplishments despite only using 10% of its brainpower.

But today’s humans are still stuck at 10% brain power and still act like morons. While Lucy transcends space and time, a whole bunch of people die a few feet from her.

After the ritual turning Lucy into an immortal god, she gives Dr. Norman a USB stick containing all of her knowledge, which is pretty convenient.

When a cop barges into the room and asks where is Lucy, he receives a text message that sums up the entire movie.

The cop then looks towards the sky in admiration, the same way people usually look towards the heavens when thinking of God.

The movie ends with another symbolic scene: The lifeless body of a mobster seen from above as if it was Lucy overlooking the blood sacrifice that was required to complete the occult ritual.

Lucy was bashed by critics for being somewhat nonsensical – but being “sensical” was not the point of this movie. It is a treatise on Luciferian philosophy, and it can only be fully “appreciated” by those who understand this philosophy. For those who don’t, well, there’s a bunch of action scenes peppered throughout to keep them entertained. Meanwhile, they absorb the occult meaning of the movie without even realizing what’s happening. These action scenes were meant to be in sharp contrast with Lucy’s quest for knowledge because Luciferians perceive a sharp contrast between them and the masses. While Lucy’s busy achieving immortality and turning into a god, a bunch of clueless guys kill each other for no good reason. And nobody cares. Because their lives are considered worthless.

Therefore, beyond the nonsensical premise of Lucy, there is a very “sensical” message, one that is as powerful as it is disturbing: There are two classes of humans on Earth and transhumanism will widen the gap between them. Most of the projects involving transhumanism have been described by observers as “playing God”. But this is not simply an expression: It is exactly what Luciferians are about.",conspiracy
251,"NBA star Kyrie Irving made headlines last week when he revealed that he believes that the world was flat, and surprisingly he’s not the only famous person who doesn’t believe the globe is … well, a globe.

Over NBA All-Star weekend, Irving’s comments became a hot topic of conversation, and even resulted in some gentle ribbing from fellow Cleveland Cavaliers player LeBron James. While Irving later said he found the reaction to his flat-Earth theory “hilarious,” he also said that his opinion on the shape of the world we live in shouldn’t really matter to other people.

“Does it matter to you that I believe the world is flat?” he asked reporters. “It really doesn’t matter.” Then he added, perhaps facetiously, “The fact that it’s a conversation, I’m glad it got people talking like this.”

Well, before she was banned from Twitter for posting a picture of herself and two other men giving a Nazi salute, Tequila was one of the most prominent Flat Earthers out there — she briefly enjoyed a moment in the spotlight when one very passionate rant went viral. Of course, she also believes that she’s a clone — or a robot — and yeah, there’s the whole Nazi thing as well, so maybe take her ideas with a grain of salt.

Yes, can you believe it was just one short year ago that rapper B.o.B. got into a Twitter feud with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson over whether the Earth was flat? And then Tyson’s nephew — also a rapper — released a B.o.B. diss track about the fight? The tweet below was his most compelling argument, which … yeah, that’s not great.

Flat Earthers love this quote from Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw — apparently, they think it’s evidence that he’s one of them. But at best it’s a case of selective listening — this is from the introduction to Shaw’s 1924 play Joan of Arc and the next sentence reads, “I must not, by the way, be taken as implying that the earth is flat, or that all or any of our amazing credulities are delusions or impostures.” So, uh, sorry to ruin one of your mascots, guys.

“Is the world flat? I’ve never thought about it.” Those words, from a 2007 episode of the View, would continue to haunt former co-host Shepherd, who was dragged by quite a few people — including Rosie O’Donnell — for her perceived ignorance. But Shepherd elaborated, saying it’s not that she necessarily believes that the world is flat, it’s just that she has other things on her mind: “I’ll tell you what I’ve thought about: how I’m going to feed my child.” To which Barbara Walters pithily responded, “Well, you can do both.” (In a 2009 interview, Shepherd further explained herself, saying that she did indeed know that the Earth is not flat.)

Dolby released The Flat Earth in 1984, and it was adopted by his fan club as their official name. Dolby does not believe in a flat earth, but Flat Earth Society Daniel Shenton credits Dolby’s album with inspiring him to discover the theory. “It was the late 1990s and I started doing research into what the Flat Earth Society was,” Shenton told the Guardian. “I had heard of it and, when I did some more research, I eventually ended up believing its ideas were true.” Shenton offered Dolby membership #00001 in the reconvened Flat Earth Society in 2009, and Dolby accepted.",mainstream
457,"The rights of the American people have been, and are being trampled into the dust, as the pseudo-representatives glut themselves from the trough of lobbyists and oligarchs alike. It could be proven, but won’t be proven: the investigating “authority” is not accountable to the people and there is no oversight. The FBI, and any investigations under special counsel? Look at Fast and Furiousand how the Attorney General’s office covered that one up. What is needed to prove it? Something that doesn’t exist. Here is what is needed:

A team of spotless individuals with a leader of unquestionable character and service…with complete authority and impunity: unable to be hindered by any federal, state, or local police and army of “authorities.” This Special Investigative Team would have the power to investigate fully any and all ties to Congressmen, Senators, and Supreme Court judges…to find evidence of bribery, kickbacks, and influence peddling…and then arrest them and bring them to trial.

Everyone can jump up and down, desiring to boil in oil anyone making such a suggestion; however, without some kind of accountability, these elected officials are running rampant and trampling the rights of the citizens. Who is going to stop it? The courts? The courts are the biggest pack of crooks of all. Yes, “Your Honor,” and “The Honorable,” ad infinitum.

I guarantee that a Special Investigator with impunity would have found plenty of coral snakes under Chief (in)Justice John Roberts’ front porch…if Obama and Holder had been made to step aside and an investigation had been done. This should have been done after he cast his deciding vote on Obamacare. Going back a few years, Obamacare would have never made it to the floor of the Senate if Olympia Snow (R, ME) had not allowed it to come up for a vote. Who paid her off?

In order to follow the money, you have to be allowed to follow it: or you’ll just end up arrested or dead.

The special unit of investigators I suggested? They need to be armed to the teeth, and they need giant, shiny badges that every human in the Western Hemisphere will recognize. And why not? It worked for Elliot Ness and his team. This won’t be done, of course, for one reason:

The method would work and the crooked politicos would be caught.

In a system replete with corruption, we can’t have a group of investigators who are not corrupt and “untouchable,” because that would threaten the existing social, political, economic, and religious order. We have a Supreme Court that selectively interprets legislation, effectively bypassing checks and balances under the Constitution and establishing themselves as lawmakers, or “law-breakers,” whichever you prefer. But they are “jaw-breakers,” and in essence breaking the people’s jaws to prevent argument as they stick the rings in their noses and then recess for three months to hide. There is no accountability fostered upon them, no recourse for their “Supreme Decisions” that affect 315 million people.",conspiracy
121,"Where is Wormwood now? Does NASA know about it? If Wormwood is a rogue planet coming as early as 2026, how do I explain zero verifiable sightings? Is NASA hiding it, is it unusually dark, supernaturally cloaked or something else entirely? In this article I tackle the unanswerable question that has dogged me for over a decade with my new insight to finally provide a satisfying explanation based on Biblical precedents. Also why Judea definitely won't be overrun with faithless Wormwood survivalists and why even the rich won't be prepared for Wormwood.

If you're new to my site and want to understand what I'm about or what makes me different from the rest of the prophecy field, you could sum it up with one word:

That's the name given to the cosmic body in Revelation (Rev 8:10-11) which will nearly tear Earth apart as it passes. Although it is not identified or named until Revelation 8, it is responsible for the global disruptions of Revelation 6 and 7, too. This includes a global earthquake, asteroid and meteorite impacts, global fires, tsunamis, contaminated water and darkened skies (by 33%). In other words, it brings the end of the world as we know it (""TEOTWAWKI""). It's so important that more of the seven seals, and seven trumpets and seven bowls are dedicated to it than any other end time event outside the wrath of God which is all seven bowls. It occupies the 6th seal, 7th seal, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th trumpets. All of it is pretrib, or before the Great Tribulation (5th - 7th trumpet) or any chance of a rapture including the fanciful, pretrib rapture.

Did you know Jesus also prophesied about Wormwood? He called its effects the ""beginning of sorrows/birth pains"" or the kick off to the end time events (after the Good News of the Kingdom goes out first - Mt 24:14). You have to put Matthew, Mark and Luke's ""Olivet Discourse"" accounts together along with Revelation in hand to see that Jesus' ""earthquakes in diverse places"" is the same ""great earthquake"" of Revelation (Rev 6:12). You then can see that Jesus' global famine, pestilence is right there in the first four trumpets since famine and pestilence will follow all the death, destruction and blockage of sunlight needed for crops.

Revelation shows that what follows Wormwood's cataclysm is the Great Tribulation. That's when Satan is cast down from Heaven to open the abyss up and release the nephilim monster ""locusts"" so they can torture humanity into taking the Mark of the Beast. Yes, obviously, Satan takes advantage of the ""end of the world"" to compel humanity when they desperately need a savior, to receive his: the Antichrist. You just have to worship him, not as Christ, but as God himself (2Th 2:4) by accepting his mark (demons included).

I explain all of this on this site and my book Know the Future. However, my peers almost universally ignore Wormwood. If they don't they tend to interpret it allegorically (e.g., as Chernobyl). It's simply too hard to make sense of literally unless you specialize in it like I did many years ago.

""Tim, Is NASA Lying To Us?""

Not only is this pivotal prophetic object conspicuously missing from the end time timeline of my peers, it's also missing in another significant way. There are no reliable observations by reputable astronomers. (I hope we can quickly agree that ""reputable"" excludes sightings that are only found in the YouTube video universe and not reproducible in the real universe.)

Related to this, I had an interesting conversation on Facebook with a supporter that started with the following question:

This is a ""frequently asked question"" which I have been hearing for years (but sadly not yet in my FAQ!). The question has kind of a conspiratorial slant to it, supposing that a government organization like NASA would cover-up information about a threat to earth. The movie Deep Impact imagined exactly such a scenario. In the movie, the government did not release information about an incoming comet to ""prevent crashing the economy"" through the public panic that it would cause.

Forget NASA: Amateur Astronomers Should Already See It

Yet, worrying about NASA and what they know and when they knew it distracts us from a better question.

That question comes to light when you understand Wormwood is not some small comet which we need depend upon a national space agency like NASA to spot for us. When you take into account all the details about Wormwood in Revelation including:
• Rains enough meteorites and asteroids to impact and burn the entire earth's surface (Rev 8:7-8)
• Changes earth's orbit and therefore calendar from 365-day year/29-day month to a 360/30 calendar.

It all points to a planetary-sized object capable of tug-boating the earth. The only object that fits this profile is the recently coined ""dwarf planet"" class of body. That's a planet generally smaller than Mars. Wormwood would need enough mass to drastically perturb Earth's orbit while remaining small enough for Earth's gravity to rip it apart and rain its pieces down to Earth in ""safer-sized"" chunks just as the 3rd trumpet describes so accurately (Rev 8:10).

Such a large body would be seen ""decades out."" Since I believe God has confirmed to me that Wormwood is due in 2026, that means even amateur astronomers should already have spotted Wormwood years ago; NASA over a decade ago. This timetable of sighting is confirmed by esteemed Caltech astronomer, Mike Brown, the man who ""killed Pluto."" In an email exchange with him in 2015, I described the Wormwood scenario and asked him if there is any way known to astronomers how a dwarf planet could sneak up on earth undetected. Here's his responses:

Whether you think my conclusion about Wormwood coming in 2026 is right or not, if Wormwood must be a ""Mars-sized"" object to fulfill what Revelation describes then you have two choices:
• Either the end is still at least two decades away. (I have a hard time believing this for many reasons even before we get into my dreams.)
• The end is sooner, but Wormwood is somehow invisible. Because of its size, a supposed NASA conspiracy (sorry, flat-earthers) does not stop amateur telescopes from detecting it.

This has been my dilemma for many years now. I have had no good explanation for how Wormwood can be coming but not visible, although I've played with several theories.

One of my previous, tenuous theories was that Wormwood is an unusually dark object. It would have to be so dark (even darker than charcoal) that it reflects too little light to be spotted early enough like Mike Brown described above. The problem with this is there are a growing number of infrared telescopes such as those used in the survey for NEOs (near earth objects) that can spot even dark objects. Also, whenever Wormwood is in transit in front of a distant star, it becomes detectable as well.

In other words, there is no realistic, reasonable, natural way I can see that Wormwood can be out there and not be seen already.

It Gets Worse: The New ""Judea Overrun"" Element

Based on much reading and consideration of Revelation 6:12-19, I have always felt that the panicked exodus of humanity to the caves in the mountains described there demanded that Wormwood must be undetected until nearly the last minute. We're talking hours of warning, not even days (more on why below). With no preparation, all humans seek protection simultaneously from both the falling meteorites and from the rising tsunami flood waters. Caves in high elevation is the only option.

If people had some substantial warning, not every class of society would be so panicked. Certainly, given enough notice, rich and mighty people would be able to build bunkers on high ground to prepare for Wormwood. In contrast to this, Revelation says that even the kings/nobles, rich and powerful men were panicking along with the poor and common (Rev 6:15). That leads me to conclude Wormwood completely blindsides the Earth with no useful warning for any practical serious ""prepping.""

There is a new twist to this conclusion when you consider God's escape plan in Judea for his people who he calls to safety there (Joel 2:32). Remember that Elijah the prophet will probably warn people about the need to flee to Judea before Wormwood (Joel 2:32=Mal 4:6). But very few will listen for many reasons I cover in my article on the Judea escape plan, including Christian leaders denouncing Elijah as a heretic and the fact that a post-nuclear-war Israel is the last place anyone would want to move to. (Even when I decided to tour Israel in 2002 during the Second Intifada, many loved ones expressed confusion over why I would want to go there!)

Now imagine that Wormwood were sighted and confirmed even days before it hits. You would have tons of people who did not believe Elijah's warning that are now suddenly thinking after seeing pictures of Wormwood inbound that it's a good idea to start heading to Judea. Judea would be overrun and, worse, the people who come would not really fit the group of faithful there. They would be mostly faithless people who do not love God and his Word but only want to take a chance on something that might save their skin.

Why Going to Judea Will Take Radical Faith and Discernment: Astronomers?

Unless God does some kind of dome-like force-field to prevent that (earlier than I thought he would to protect us from the falling meteorites), Wormwood being confirmed by astronomers early presents a major problem.

This leads me to my next, recent conclusion: I'm convinced that astronomers, not ministers, will be the biggest obstacle to even sincere believers obeying the command to flee their countries (Rev 18:4) and go to safety in Judea.
• ""Heretic"" Elijah will be saying that a major planet-sized unknown cosmic body is going to bring catastrophe.
• Trusted scientists will be saying that this is impossible, just as Mike Brown did in the quote above. They will point to the world's NEO survey program that has already found 90% of tens of thousands of objects 1km sized and larger that are close enough to threaten earth. In response to Elijah's warning of Wormwood coming scientists will say, ""If Wormwood is as major as this Elijah/prophet guy is saying, our surveys would have found it long ago and we could certainly find it now that we know what to look for.""

In this way, it won't matter that what Elijah says is confirmable in a prophetic book trusted by billions of Christians. They may believe that Revelation says an object is coming, but they won't agree that it is coming in their lifetime—or that they need to do anything at all anyway because of the ""pretrib rapture before anything bad happens.""

After covering all the above points with my Facebook correspondent, I was left with the conclusion that there really is no natural way to explain how Wormwood would sneak up on earth with only hours of warning. Yet I still saw this scenario as required by my reading of Scripture. If it was not naturally possible, the only possibility left was that it was supernatural. In other words, God had to be doing something miraculous with Wormwood to keep it as a matter of faith, not sight (2Co 5:7).

This in turn would keep the numbers of those fleeing to Judea relatively small, perhaps under a million. That's less than 1 in 10,000 people based on the expected world population of 8 billion people in 2026. This amounts to only one person per town as having the radical faith and discernment needed to go where Elijah says to when it looks just all wrong.

When I discussed this conclusion with Katrina, she immediately seemed to get a word or inspiration from God. (She has a gift in this area that I stopped doubting long ago.) She immediately blurted out:

Wow! Immediately the idea appealed to me as I remembered this passage in the Wormwood Revelation 6-8 passage:

I had often wondered if that passage indicated that Wormwood was not already out there but something sent from Heaven just on time to do what Revelation 6-8 described (if these two verses are slightly out of order chronologically, which is OK speaking of Heaven vs. Earth chronology in different dimensions).

Katrina's comment about ""another dimension"" was apropos given how the ""incense burner"" that the angel throws fire from is not in some other part of time-space but rather up in Heaven (Rev 8:1). Heaven is in another dimension where only spirits can go, the so-called spiritual plane beyond the physical plane. For an angel to throw something from Heaven at the Earth requires the object to pass from one dimension (God's) to another (ours). Neat insight!

I was extremely pleased with this answer and still am upon further consideration. I considered how God has done supernatural things to bring disasters on Earth before in the Bible. For example, Noah's Flood, or the parting and then collapsing of the Red Sea to drown the Egyptians was supernatural. Joshua's long day and Hezekiah's Sundial miracles both required God to intervene supernaturally in our solar system, too. Even if these phenomenon have partly or mostly natural dimensions to them, God clearly intervened supernaturally to some extent to make the rest happen.

Probably the best precedent of all in this regard is the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Sulfur brimstone rained down out of the sky onto the city right on schedule as Lot and his family fled. I collected some of that brimstone when I visited Gomorrah on Michael Rood's first Israel tour in 2002. They say the sulfur is unlike any other sulfur formation on earth. This fits it being a special creation for that time and purpose out of thin air above the four cities marked for destruction. The sulfur burning was natural, but the sulfur ball creation was a supernatural event.

Similarly, most of Wormwood's effects can be explained naturally by a dwarf planet of the right size passing by earth at the right angle and right velocity. Getting all three of those vectors exactly right already points towards divine intervention rather than a random, chance object that started in motion during creation week. The idea that Wormwood is instead created by divine power just when it is needed only extends that thinking behind the divine calibration of the three vectors. At the same time, I think it solves the Wormwood dilemma I've been facing and have been unable to answer by any other, natural means.

Yes, I'm saying the reason no one sees Wormwood yet nor will see it in time to do anything is because it does not exist yet in our physical universe. It's not ""created"" yet. It may exist in heaven in the embers of the altar, but that's it. Just like the brimstone that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah did not exist until the time of judgment.

Of course, hearing all this may be a buzzkill for some. I just shared my contention that God is shooting Wormwood at the earth on purpose; it's no accident. That's a little uncomfortable for me, too. On the other hand, as mentioned above, do we really think anything differently about Noah's Flood that God sent killing all but eight?)

Finally: How To Save Your Family

If you want to be safe from Wormwood, of course your best bet will be to go to Judea where even the falling meteorites won't touch us—although of course there will be survivors outside Judea, you know, the ones who later get marked by the Beast. Personally, I want to obey God (Rev 18:4) and go to Judea (Mt 24:16), and do so as early as possible. There is no place I would rather be than a part of the camp of the faithful saints that will be forming there. As I have shared with supporters, my exhaustive prophecy research, along with a few divine dreams, have led me to conclude that Judea will open up to workers in 2022.

If you want to save yourself, then in the time we have left I recommend you do as Jesus said and pray daily for the strength to escape (Lk 21:36 - the very verse that inspired the domain name of this website). Work on your faith and your repentance and draw closer to God in prayer and his Word. Slow down so you may learn to hear God, repurposing time currently devoted to modern distractions. You're not likely to leave home for an unpleasant land if God does not direct your steps and you do not know how to tell where and when God is leading.

You may say today reading this that you definitely want to be in Judea. Just wait until you see what Judea becomes post-war and what people say about Elijah and his theory. To put it bluntly, it will be like deciding to move to a radioactive leper colony in the desert. You better have big, radical faith and know for sure God is telling you to go there or you won't go as easily as you think.

The biggest obstacle to this generation's development of faith like that is in how we're too busy and too distracted. Our minds are constantly occupied with audio, video, text and endless worries. We always have a screen or other electronic device with stimulating information and amusement beckoning us. For example, just the other day I saw someone wearing an Apple Watch, proof of how the disruptive, mind-captivating input knows no bounds. God cannot get through to us past all that. Hence we are ""naked"" (lacking good works of the saints - Rev 19:8) and ""blind"" (lacking spiritual discernment) just as was prophesied about our Laodicean church age (Rev 3:17).

You need to change radically. This is possible by focusing on becoming like Jesus, just as he tasked believers with doing (Mt 5-7). Being like Jesus may sound unattainable, ridiculous or insulting to Jesus. Yet, the first church in Jerusalem accomplished exactly this as the Book of Acts records. The first church had ""favor with all the people"" (Acts 2:47) who ""esteemed them"" (Acts 5:13). How did the first church pull off what no Christian church since has been able to do? Simple: ""They continued in the apostle's doctrine"" (Acts 2:42) which of course the apostles learned from Jesus. When's the last time you focused on studying Jesus' words until you understood them? (I did exactly that to understand finally what the Good News of the Kingdom he taught was about.)

If you want your family to come with you, all your convincing, pleading and normal ""Christian witnessing"" won't cut it. They need to respect you as someone Godly and esteem you as better than them in this area before they will ever listen to you on a decision of this magnitude.

How Did Noah and Lot Save Their Families? Do That

How do you think Noah and Lot were able to convince their immediate family to come with them? It began years before. Their family knew them well enough to recognize them as righteous men who had God working with them in their lives. Those outside their house didn't have enough respect or trust in Noah and Lot to upset their life on the unlikely chance they were right about an unprecedented destruction about to rain down. Like those times, I don't expect anyone to come to Judea who does not have rare radical faith themselves or they live with someone who does who they respect because of their loving, peaceful walk (Luke 1:79; Rom 3:17; Isaiah 59:8).

We don't listen to people we don't respect. If you focus on repenting and changing to have God's light and love flow through your words and actions to your family, they will notice the radical changes. They will listen to you like never before. That's the secret from the playbook Jesus taught the apostles, and that the apostles in turn taught the Jerusalem church. They proved it was possible to actually do what Jesus said and be like him.

Christianity has lost this playbook, but you can rediscover it, just as we are doing. The support team on this site is dedicated to teaching from this playbook today. Much like a Kickstarter project, your support now as a ""funder"" gets you benefits from my special supporter content. But it also helps us to produce something even better to get out to many more down the road. The concept is to create a workbook teaching how to repent and change to become like Jesus like the Jerusalem church did. A novel to teach this same information packaged as entertainment will follow...

1025,"I am sitting beside a lake in Northern California and the sky is an open blue canvas as far to the left and right of me as I can see; but it is smeared with graffiti and it is the wrong shade of blue, dull and pale. Just few years ago it would have been turquoise from where I am sitting and only cumulus clouds might have hung low, seeming almost tangible behind the ridges on the other side of the lake. The rest of that open dome would have been nothing but solid aqua-blue, a shade that is almost beyond description. I fell in love with that sky when we came here to live nearly ten years ago, deeply, crazy in love.

On February 14th, I sat in the front row at a conference on geoengineering at the 2015 AAAS meeting in San Jose, California. I watched a panel of scientists and one law professor each take his turn in a sort of performance that made no sense to me. On his way in, Alan Robock of Rutgers University went out of his way to say to a group of activists in front of the convention center, “I don't know what you're all protesting. It's nothing but water vapor.” This is the man who, in 2008, wrote “20 Reasons Why Geoengineering May Be a Bad Idea”. During the conference he made it a point to say that the reason those of us in Northern California notice these trails so much more than other people and think they are a problem is because our sky is so blue.

Dear Alan: Our sky was “so blue”. The trails you claim are nothing but water vapor are spreading out all over our sky and they're not only dimming the sun but are completely changing its color to a silvery blue.

What I'm struggling to understand is why people would go along with this. As I type, there are almost 20,000 signatures on a petition I wrote several months ago, and those people all see what isreally happening. Their comments are from the heart. They miss the sun. They miss their natural sky. Their children have breathing problems. For me, looking at this smeared mess over my head feels the same as when I am in a place of natural beauty and the rocks are sprayed with graffiti or there is trash on the ground. No matter what the words are or the wrapper that has been left behind, it says, “Disrespectful man was here.”

Who would invent a concept like deliberately spraying pollution into the sky? What kind of mind conceives an idea this horrible and says to someone, “Hey, we could intentionally pollute the sky and make fake clouds so that we can go on polluting the atmosphere with greenhouse gases for as long as we want. We could even control the weather!” What kind of people sit around the table in the planning room, nod their heads and reply, “Say, that's a swell idea!”? Haven't these people ever gone hiking? Have they ever paddled a canoe? Are they people who don't know the silky feel of a baby's hair beneath their fingertips? Are they people who don't see the beauty in a child's smile when he crosses a finish line and can still breathe? Or is the feeling of a paycheck being pressed into their palms the only thing that makes their heart race a little faster, or pulls their smile a little broader?

It is a beautiful plan, really. First, we were all programmed to think that only those who join the clubs, play for the team, fight for our country, or drink with the frat are “normal”. Those of us who crouched in the woods, dug in the dirt, collected pine cones, insects and objects other than shells on the beach were the weirdos. Most human beings attend ceremonies, follow traditions, perform rituals, stand in line, and fail to question because that is what has been expected of us all our lives. The television writes our script for existence in the modern world. The newscasters tell us only what they're permitted to say, and we are programmed to blindly accept only that which is “officially” published by certain “credible” institutions or academic authors.

Enter the word that separates the crowd: “Chemtrails”. It is pulled out like a hand puppet to create social exclusion. It manufactures instant division: the Us Team and the Them Team of the world's skywatchers. The Us Team thinks what is being done to the sky is insanity. We are watching the trees die from chemicals and lack of full sunlight. Some of us are aware of the raspy laugh or hoarse-sounding cough that had its onset when the spraying started above us. For others, the health consequences have been worse.

The Them Team is a mystery to me. Were they forced to wear bow ties at private school somewhere, to stand in line just a little too quietly when they wanted to run around on the playground instead? When they were children, were they forced into submission by an overly stern parent? Or are they just plain insane? Who would do this to our planet or go along with doing it to the only Earth we have? Who would turn a blind eye to what is happening and instantly tack on the title “Chemtrailer” to every person who questions the blatant mess that is intentionally being created daily by jet aircraft? What kind of person would publish a children's book, a movie, a photograph, or a computer game that subtly sells this concept by incorporating it into the artwork? Who are these people, and how in the name of God did I end up on the same planet with them?

Several times a day, I go out and walk the circumference of my above-ground swimming pool, looking for bumble bees to save from drowning in the water. Most of the time I scoop them up with my bare hands because they seem to somehow know I'm there to help. I place them as gently as I can onto the lavender plants and hope they can hear the others and recover. If they are faltering, I tell them they must try harder and I nudge them to flutter their wings so they will dry sooner. They are a gift. They are something the Them Team would not understand. They were something I overlooked most of my life until they disappeared. In the spring of 2013, only a couple of weeks after I saw the first group of jets spray an aerosol haze above my house, the bumble bees vanished. Every other insect on our property soon disappeared as well. By August of that year, the pool was devoid of insects and the porch light glowed moth-free, a ghostly reminder of what was being destroyed. I knew it was the trails. But I am just a “chemtrailer”. What do I know?

The Them Team has used their social exclusion tactics to draw a line in the sand so they can go on about the business of lying or denying. I think it's some of both, and I think the people on that team have many different agendas. By pulling out the label and plastering it around, some of them get to stand on a tiny pedestal and do what I call The Academic Chuckle when they deem it appropriate. They get to publicly make fun of thousands of people who have eyes they trust and children they are concerned about. They get to destroy the world while pretending they're saving it, and hundreds of people are going right along with them by not having the scrotal fortitude to stand up to them and their ready-made label. (Politicians are included in this long list of cowards.)

Geoengineering is happening. The government is manipulating the weather. Very wealthy people and corrupt corporations have a tremendous amount to gain from pushing California into a drought. Giant pharmaceutical companies are making millions on people with depressed immune systems and asthma. Welcome to America, everyone. Land of the oblivious, home of the cowardly. This is why the Them Team is getting away with it. People want to be part of something. They don't want to face social exclusion. They don't want to be ridiculed. They don't want to hear the Academic Chuckle and be on the wrong side of it. But there was a time when most of the world thought the earth was flat and people who thought it was round were laughed at, a time when Galileo was punished for his views on heliocentrism. Rachel Carson was publicly ridiculed when she warned of the dangers of DDT. Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was scorned for his suggestion that doctors wash their hands in a sanitizing solution before delivering babies in order to prevent childbed fever; and Louis Pasteur's ideas were met with skepticism. What aspect of the human mind makes it so resistant to new concepts, so unable to rise to the challenge of facing existing problems? How hard is it to look up at the sky and see what is happening? How hard is it to see that the trees are dying?

If I cared what other people thought, I wouldn't be writing this. Oh, sure, we all do to an extent, but there are some of us who were just born to pour the poison Kool-Aid down the drain and say, “Not for me!” When I was four years old, I went to nursery school in a section of the First United Methodist Church, and I knew what was beyond the door in the baby room. It led into the rest of the building and ultimately to the church sanctuary. Every so often, my grandmother would drag me reluctantly to Sunday services and feed me pink mint candy to keep me quiet, so I remembered seeing the sanctuary with its silky blue cushions and looming stained-glass windows. I was determined to find my way to it. I convinced about four other kids to join the caper. We sneaked through the nursery room door and skipped through the dark warren of hallways until we came to the light, and we exploded with giggles in that lofty, enormous room. Without a congregation, it had a beautiful dreamlike quality and it never occurred to me that I was breaking a rule. I only knew that I was on adventure and we had reached our destination. The punishment turned out to be better than the crime itself, for we were sentenced to help prepare lunches in the deepest, darkest part of the church with Mrs. Brezina for a week straight. She was the kindest jailer imaginable and her kitchen was tucked into a forgotten grotto that was as interesting as it was neglected.

Those of us who recruit others to sneak off to find a beautiful place that resides in our memory are the kinds of people who don't join clubs. We follow only rules that matter and we step out of line. Out of curiosity we play with the water squirter in the dentist chair when nobody is looking. We think for ourselves. We became accustomed long ago to being called names because we've always been different, so as a tactic of psychological manipulation, calling us names doesn't really work. The Them Team can try as hard as it wants to. It's not going to back us down and make us think, “Good heavens, someone is disdainfully lumping us into a category so we'd better shut up and go on about the business of fitting in.” Did Rachel Carson try to fit in? Semmelweis? Galileo? No, they did what they thought was right despite extreme opposition by their peers. They might not have had happy endings, but they all played a significant role in exposing the truth.

There was brilliance in contorting the word “chemtrails” so that it immediately triggers an emotional response in certain people. It has bought the Them Team time. In just two syllables it creates an obstacle. For people who believe in the established order of things, still believe our government is working for the greater good, and don't like to buck the system, there is that word like a comfortable old jacket ready to be slipped on to protect them from the truth: “The chemtrail people must be wrong because they are associated with a detestable word that makes them sound nuts.” And then they pull the jacket around them a little tighter. It is a convenient way out. Score one for the Them Team. They just got more time to carry on with their nasty deeds.

Human behavior is baffling. When did people become so out of touch with the natural world that they can't look up at the sky and see that things are just not right? When did seemingly intelligent people lose their ability to use reason? Scientists are “proposing” the very thing we are witnessing, and yet people are letting themselves be manipulated by one simple two-syllable word so that they are completely unable to see the truth hiding in plain sight.

The reality is, if our planetary situation is so dire that spraying a layer of pollution into the atmosphere is our only hope, people need to know. And if spraying aerosols into the atmosphere is putting millions of dollars into the pockets of big businesses and allowing companies to keep polluting for the almighty dollar, people need to know. If our governments are manipulating the weather, whatever the reason, people need to know.

There is no Us Team and Them Team. We are all riding on a relatively small ship in a very big universe, and it's dangerously close to sinking and taking us with it. That human tendency to think there is a big fix, that we can pull out all the stops in the end and save the day, is just wrong. We can't. It's time for everyone to face what is happening because, at this point, the truth is our only hope.",conspiracy

New York Times, Drug Companies and Doctors Battle Over the Future of Fecal Transplants by Andrew Jacobs — There’s a new war raging in health care, with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake and thousands of lives in the balance. The battle, pitting drug companies against doctors and patient advocates, is being fought over the unlikeliest of substances: human excrement. The clash is over the future of fecal microbiota transplants, or F.M.T., a revolutionary treatment that has proved remarkably effective in treating Clostridioides difficile, a debilitating bacterial infection that strikes 500,000 Americans a year and kills 30,000… “The first principle of medicine is do no harm, and at the moment we don’t have a long-term track record of F.M.T.’s adverse effects,” said Dr. Sahil Khanna, an associate professor of gastroenterology at the Mayo Clinic who has conducted industry-funded clinical trials on fecal transplants. “We also need to move away from transferring poo from one person to another.”

USA Today, Daylight saving time starts this weekend: Who observes it, will it affect health? by Scott Craven, Ashley May, Doyle Rice — On Sunday, the vast majority of Americans will lose an hour of sleep as clocks are set ahead for daylight saving time… Gaining or losing an hour probably will affect sleep patterns, often for about five to seven days, said Timothy Morgenthaler, Mayo Clinic's co-director of the Center for Sleep Medicine. The most notable changes are in those who regularly do not get enough sleep. People who are sleep-deprived might struggle with memory, learning, social interactions and overall cognitive performance.

Reuters, Yoga linked to lowered blood pressure with regular practice by Lisa Rapaport — Adults who practice yoga with breathing and relaxation exercises at least three times a week may have lower blood pressure than people who don’t, a research review suggests… One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on the intensity of yoga practices, including how long people held poses and how rapidly participants transitioned from one position to the next, the study authors note in Mayo Clinic Proceedings… “In general, yoga improves balance, strength and flexibility, but trying to be extremely flexible with fragile joints can cause problems,” said senior study author Dr. Mehrsheed Sinaki, a rehabilitation specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “Also, if a person is 70 or 80 and does too many hip-opening movements or hyper extensions, they may develop hip pain,” Sinaki said by email. While most people can practice yoga safely, older people with osteoporosis (thinning, brittle bones) should be careful, agreed Dr. Edward Laskowski, coauthor of an accompanying editorial and co-director of Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine.

Shape, Pregnancy Sleep Tips to Help You Finally Get a Solid Night's Rest by Cassie Shortsleeve — As your belly grows during pregnancy, sleep becomes more and more elusive. Just about *everything* seems to impair your ability to catch some much-needed zzz's: being incredibly uncomfortable (hi, kicking baby/belly/other bodily and hormonal changes), having to go pee 24/7, nighttime acid reflux (ugh), stress, even a new snoring habit… Waking up all the time to pee in the middle of the night? ""Many moms are awakened due to vigorous fetal movement during the night. This often includes small hands or feet poking into the bladder, causing the urge to urinate,"" says Regan Theiler, M.D., Ph.D., an ob-gyn at the Mayo Clinic. ""Given that the bladder is already squeezed by the uterus and baby, many women wake to urinate every hour in the third trimester."" While there's not much you can do about that, there are some diet changes you can make that can help. Avoiding bladder irritants such as caffeine, carbonation, citrus, and spicy foods can stretch out the time between bathroom trips overnight, says Dr. Theiler. Skip sugary foods and beverages before bed, too (a good idea for everyone trying to improve their sleep)—it could decrease how much your baby moves when you're trying to fall asleep, she says.

MinnPost, Small towns near Rochester hope — and plan — for DMC-fueled growth by Gregg Aamot — In 2015, residents of Chatfield approved a levy request from the local school district, which was seeking more money to cover its operating expenses. The next year, voters approved another request – this time for $10.8 million for improvement projects at the high school. The city got into the act in 2017, asking for $4.4 million for the construction of a pool. That, too, won approval from the voters. It was an impressive trifecta and, in some observers’ eyes, a promising reflection of the public mood in this town of 2,900 in the southeast corner of Minnesota. “People don’t vote for those things without confidence in their future,” said Joel Young, Chatfield’s city clerk for the past 28 years. While it’s difficult to pinpoint the source of such civic pride, one plausible mood-booster in this region of Minnesota is a multibillion-dollar economic development initiative under way in Rochester – an ambitious plan that aims to make that city’s famed Mayo Clinic an even bigger draw than it already is.

An endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Kapoor also is an assistant professor of medicine at the Women’s Health Clinic with special interest in menopause, obesity and menopausal hormone therapy. When she began her practice, she was sometimes frustrated by how little emphasis was placed on menopause, especially since, given increasing longevity, women can now spend more than a third of their lives in menopause. But while women’s health in general and menopause in particular were once ignored and understudied, “That’s changing now,” she said. “And I’m so glad to be a part of it.” We talked to Kapoor about treating hot flashes, the return of hormone replacement therapy and the dreaded menopause belly.

On Valentine’s Day 2009, she didn’t feel well enough to go out to a couple’s dinner with her friends in Marco Island, FL.

Daggett hadn’t been herself since a heart procedure for atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, a few months earlier. The procedure went as planned, but afterward, she just got sicker and sicker. Her blood pressure was out of control -- always too high or too low. She was nauseated. Her vision was sometimes blurred. And her usually soft, rosy complexion was ashen, scaly, and leathery… After 8 more days of tests at Mayo, Daggett heard the words she’d been waiting to hear for months. “My doctor hugged me and said, ‘We know what’s wrong with you,’ ” she recalls. A genetic test showed that she had a variation in one of her genes -- CYP2D6 -- that made her body unable to process the medications she received after her heart procedure.

Forbes, Americans Sit More Than Anytime In History And It's Literally Killing Us by Nicole Fisher — Everyone knows that being sedentary is bad for your health. It’s not the act of sitting itself that will kill you, but the repercussions of moving too little.

Daily Beast, Why I Don't Miss My Breasts by Michelle Cottle — …To be clear: the usual course of treatment for DCIS, the earliest form of breast cancer, is not a bilateral mastectomy.

The Mayo Clinic’s website notes that it generally “isn’t life threatening”—so long as you purge the bastard cells before they break free and start running amok. As pretty much every doctor and medical site will tell you, targeted lumpectomies are the preferred course of action for most women.

Travel Weekly, Cannabidiol blooming in hotel food and beverage options by Johanna Jainchill — One night last month at the James New York Nomad hotel, I ordered a room service meal of meatballs, Tater Tots, butter lettuce pear salad, olive tapenade and ice cream topped with caramel. I then enjoyed a really deep sleep. That might have been due to the James' very comfortable bed. But it also could have been because all the things I ate had been prepared with cannabidiol (CBD)… It all adds up to what Brent Bauer, director of the Mayo Clinic's Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program calls ""the schizophrenic realm"" in which the U.S. currently find itself with regard to cannabis. Owing to its different classifications at federal and state levels, no meaningful clinical studies on CBD are being done. ""That explains why it's very hard to get a clear-cut answer on: Is CBD good? Is it safe? Does it work?"" he said. ""If we could get past all of this legal hoopla and find some funding to do big studies, we'd have a much more directed way of saying use it or don't use it.""

And sadly, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) estimates that up to 50 percent of those people with insulin resistance and prediabetes will end up with full-blown type 2 diabetes if they don't make important changes to their lifestyle… Another study from the Center for Individualized Medicine at the Mayo Clinic followed a group of 300 people over the course of six days. The researchers looked at their glycemic responses and found that when taking into account the foods they ate and number of calories they consumed, they could only accurately predict blood sugar between 32 and 40 percent of the time. But when they looked at the specific bacteria in the microbiomes of each individual, they were able to accurately predict blood sugar response 62 percent of the time.

First, a mini-primer on blood clots in general. When you think about clots of blood, you might imagine the kind that come together when you have a cut. Your body springs into action, combining enough platelets (blood cells that adhere to each other) and proteins from plasma (the liquid part of your blood) to plug the injured blood vessel, the Mayo Clinic says. This is how clots help to stop bleeding.

El Comercio, Alfredo Quiñones: el neurocirujano que Disney busca llevar al cine by Diego Suárez Bosleman — Google translation: The Mexican Alfredo Quiñones Hinojosa has worked in more than 400 specialized publications and is the author of more than seven books. In 2014 he was elected the neurosurgeon of the year in the USA. and in 2015 the magazine ""Forbes"" considered him one of the most brilliant Mexican minds in the world. But those hands that now remove tumors before worked the earth to survive. At age 19, Quiñones was forced to cross the US border. for a better future. It's an amazing personal story that even Disney is looking to take to the big screen. However, Quiñones, current head of the Department of Neurosurgery at the Mayo Clinic (Florida), is more fascinated by one thing in particular: understanding the functioning of the brain. The specialist was in the country to treat patients of limited resources in the clinic Delgado. El Comercio was able to converse with him.

1124,"Leo Charles Ferrari (December 8, 1927 – October 7, 2010) was a St. Thomas University philosophy professor, noted Saint Augustine scholar, and founding member of the parody organization Flat Earth Society of Canada.[1][2][3]

Leo Ferrari was a founding member and head of the satirical Flat Earth Society of Canada, later renamed the Flat Earth Society (FES).[4]

In Ferrari's writings in support of the FES and the Flat Earth, he attributed everything from gender to racial inequality on the globularist and the Spherical Earth model.[5] Ferrari even claimed to have nearly fallen off ""the Edge"" of the Earth at Brimstone Head on Fogo Island.[6]

Ferrari was a key figure in the 1990 flat earth ""documentary"", In Search of the Edge.[7] In the accompanying study guide, Ferrari is outed as a ""globularist,"" someone who believes the earth is spherical.[8] The intent of the film was to promote critical thinking about media by ""[attempting] to prove in convincing fashion, something everyone knew to be false.""[8]

4,"*There was near-panic over Ebola during the Obama Administration, but people can’t get it together to worry now. Unless they’re dying in the sound of gunfire, which they are.

*There are Ebola vaccinations now but people are very flat-Earth about them.

Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is in disarray. Its population chronically battered by brutal attacks, inter-ethnic conflict and now, the Ebola virus. This is the first outbreak in what has essentially been a war zone for years.

In Beni, the epicentre of the epidemic in North Kivu province which lies to the east of the country, aid workers are regularly grounded by attacks and demonstrations by civilians asking for protection. They are unable to follow up on everyone who has had contact with Ebola patients, or conduct safe burials; two vital measures to keep the outbreak under control. “Around 4 600 contacts need to be followed up every day,” says Thomas Dehermann-Roy, Head of the EU’s humanitarian aid operations in DRC, “92 percent of those are seen, but that leaves some days where up to 400 people are not seen.”

With 344 reported cases and counting, the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu has surpassed the 318 recorded in Yambuku in 1976, the year the virus was first discovered. Today, the Ebola treatment centre in Beni is at full capacity. New cases are emerging elsewhere; in Butembo, a city of almost a million inhabitants close to the Ugandan border, in Kalungata, and in other areas where mistrust is prevalent among local communities exhausted by endless years of conflict.

The health system in this conflict-riddled region has all but crumbled. Private clinics, traditional healers, and unregulated pharmacies fill this space and compete for business. According to Dr. Ian Van Engelgem who finished a second stint in Beni as the EU’s humanitarian aid health expert, the “role of health facilities as expanders of the disease” should not be underestimated. “Mothers have taken their children to health facilities thinking it was just a flu or malaria, the symptoms at first very similar to Ebola.” However, in many health facilities, the most basic infection prevention and control measures are not rigorously applied.

This particular outbreak disproportionally affects women and children. “More than 60 percent of patients are women,” says Thomas Dehermann-Roy. Women tend to take care of the sick, making them more vulnerable to infection. An additional factor could be that pregnant and nursing women are excluded from vaccination as a safety measure. So far, more than 30 000 people have been injected with an experimental vaccine under so-called ‘compassionate use’, but more trials are needed for the vaccine to be fully licensed….",mainstream
1226,"*** 1/2 THOMAS DOLBY WITH THE LOST TOY PEOPLE. “Aliens Ate My Buick.” EMI Manhattan.

Talk about your pendulum swings. Thomas Dolby’s biggest hit, 1983’s “She Blinded Me With Science,” branded him with a wacky-professor image in the eyes of much of the buying public. His next album, 1984’s sumptuous “The Flat Earth,” seemed designed in large part to dissipate that persona with its somber tones and themes. Now, with a long-awaited follow-up four years later, he’s shed his hard-earned crown of dignity and returned (regressed?) with a severe case of the sillies.

And what a gloriously danceable case of dementia it is. “Aliens Ate My Buick” finds Dolby throwing down the funk as convincingly as any white boy with an English accent and an egghead image has a right to, taking his cues from George Clinton (who contributed to the album in flesh as well as spirit) and Prince as well as the fusionary nasty bizness of Frank Zappa. Meanwhile, have we mentioned yet that Side 1 could be the party platter of the year?

The playfully misogynistic single “Airhead” may be the first potential dance smash in recent memory to celebrate intellectual pursuits over sexual attraction. But after he hilariously professes to prefer mind over body matter, in “The Ability to Swing” he goes for musical heat over heart, with his tongue only partly in cheek, paraphrasing the Book of Ellington: “Everybody thinking, thinking pretty hard / Everybody thinking ‘bout singing from the heart / If you want my opinion it doesn’t mean a thing / If you haven’t got that ability to swing.”

A rather brazen and suspect sentiment coming from Mr. Cerebral himself--but if this record is a little shorter than usual on emotion and maybe even art, by golly, it does swing like a third-grade recess.",mainstream
1306,"THE close of one century, the dawn of another, may naturally suggest some brief retrospective glance over the path along which our science has advanced, and some general survey of its present position; but other connection with geology the beginnings and endings of centuries have none. The great periods of movement have hitherto begun, as it were, in the early twilight hours, long before the dawn. Thus the first step forward, since which there has been no retreat, was taken by Steno in the year 1669; more than a century elapsed before James Hutton (1785) gave fresh energy and better direction to the faltering steps of the young science; while it was less than a century later (1863) when Lord Kelvin brought to its aid the powers of the higher mathematics and instructed it in the teachings of modern physics. From Steno onward the spirit of geology was catastrophic; from Hutton onward it grew increasingly uniformitarian; from the time of Darwin and Kelvin it has become evolutional. The ambiguity of the word “uniformitarian “has led to a good deal of fruitless logomachy, against which it may be as well at once to guard by indicating the sense in which it is used here. In one way we are all uniformi- tarians, i. e., we accept the doctrine of the uniform action of natural causes,” but, as applied to geology, uniformity means more than this. Defined in the briefest fashion it is the geology of Lyell. Hutton had given us a “Theory of the Earth,” in its main outlines still faithful and true; and this Lyell spent his life in illustrating and advocating; but as so commonly happens, the zeal of the disciple outran the wisdom of the master, and mere opinions were insisted on as necessary dogma. What did it matter if Hutton as a result of his inquiries into terrestrial history had declared that he found no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end It would have been marvelous if he had! Consider that when Hutton's “Theory” was published, William Smith's famous discovery had not been made, and that nothing was then known of the orderly succession of forms of life, which it is one of the triumphs of geology to have revealed; consider, too, the existing state of physics at the time, and that the modern theories of energy had still to be formulated; consider, also, that spectroscopy had not yet lent its aid to astronomy and the consequent ignorance of the nature of nebulae; and then, if you will, cast a stone at Hutton. With Lyell, however, the,case was different. In pressing his uniformitarian creed upon geology, he omitted to take into account the great advances made by its sister sciences, although he had knowledge of them, and thus sinned against the light. In the last edition of the famous “Principles” we read: “It is a favorite dogma of some physicists that not only the earth, but the sun itself, is continually losing a portion of its heat, and that as there is no known source by which it can be restored, we can foresee the time when all life will cease to exist on this planet, and on the other hand we can look back to a period when the heat was so intense as to be incompatible with the existence of any organic beings such as are known to us in the living or fossil world. Opening address by the President of the Section of Geology, British Association. A geologist in search of some renovating power by which the amount of heat may be made to continue unimpaired for millions of years, past and future, in the solid parts of the earth... has been compared by an eminent physicist to one who dreams he can discover a source of perpetual motion and invent a clock with a self-winding apparatus. But why should we despair of detecting proofs of such regenerating and self-sustaining power in the works of a Divine Ar- tilicer Here we catch the true spirit of uniformity; it admittedly regards the universe as a self-winding clock, and barely conceals a conviction that the clock was warranted to keep true Greenwich time. The law of the dissipation of energy is not a dogma, but a doctrine drawn from observation, while the uniformity of Lyell is in no sense an induction; it is a dogma in the narrowest sense of the word, unproved, incapable of proof; hence perhaps its power upon the human mind; hence, also, the transitoriness of that power. Again, it is only by restricting its inquiries to the stratified rocks of our planet that the dogma of uniformity can be maintained with any pretense of argument. Directly we begin to search the heavens, the possibility, nay even the likelihood, of the nebular origin of our system, with all that it involves, is borne in upon us. Lyell therefore consistently refused to extend his gaze beyond the rocks beneath his feet, and was thus led to do a serious injury to our science. He severed it from cosmogony, for which he entertained and expressed the most profound contempt, and from the mutilation thus inflicted geology is only at length making a slow and painful recovery. Why do I dwell on these facts To depreciate Lyell By no means. No one is more conscious than I of the noble service which Lyell rendered to our cause; his reputation is of too robust a kind to suffer from my unskillful handling, and the fame of his solid contributions to science will endure long after these controversies are forgotten. The echoes of the combat are already dying away, and uni- formitarians, in the sense already defined, are now no more. Indeed, were I to attempt to exhibit any distinguished living geologist as a still surviving supporter of the narrow Lyellian creed, he would probably feel, if such a one there be, that I was unfairly singling him out for unmerited obloquy. Our science has become evolutional, and in the transformation has grown more comprehensive; her petty parochial days are done, she is drawing her provinces closer around her, and is fusing them together into a united and single commonwealth–the science of the earth. Not merely the earths crust, but the whole of earth- knowledge is the subject of our research. To know all that can be known about our planet, this, and nothing less than this, is its aim and scope. From the morphological side geology inquires, not only into the existing form and structure of tne earth, but also into the series of successive morphological states through which it has passed in a long and changeful development. Our science inquires also into the distribution of the earth in time and space; on the physiological side it studies the movements and activities of our planet; and not content with all this, it extends its researches into aetiology and endeavors to arrive at a science of causation. In these pursuits, geology calls all the other sciences to her aid. In our commonwealth there are no outlanders: if ati eminent physicist enter our territory, we do not begin at once to prepare for war, because the very fact of his undertaking a geological inquiry of itself confers upon him all the duties and privileges of citizenship. A physicist studying geology is by definition a geologist. Our only regret is, not that physicists occasionally invade our borders, but that they do not visit us oftener and make closer acquaintance with us. EARLY HISTORY OP THE EARTH–FIRST CRITICAL PERIOD. If I am bold enough to assert that cosmogony is no longer alien to geology, I may proceed further, and taking advantage of my temerity pass on to speak of things once not permitted to us. I propose, therefore, to offer some short account of the early stages in the history of the earth. Into its nebular origin we need not inquire–that is a subject for astronomers. We are content to accept the infant earth from their hands as a molten globe ready made, its birth from a gaseous nebula duly certified. If we ask, as a matter of curiosity, what was the origin of the nebula, I fear even astronomers cannot tell us. There is an hypothesis which refers it to the clashing of meteorites, but in the form in which this is usually presented it does not help us much. Such meteorites as have been observed to penetrate our atmosphere and to fall on to the surface of the earth prove on examination to have had an eventful history of their own, of which not the least important chapter was a passage through a molten state; they would thus appear to be the products rather than the progenitors of a nebula. We commence our history, then, with a rapidly rotating molten planet, not impossibly already solidified about the center and surrounded by an atmosphere of great depth, the larger part of which was contributed by the water of our present oceans, then existiug in a state of gas. This atmosphere, which exerted a pressure of something like 5000 pounds to the square inch, must have played a very important part in the evolution of our planet. The molten exterior absorbed it to an extent which depended on the pressure, and which may some day be learnt from experiment. Under the influence of the rapid rotation of the earth, the atmosphere would be much deeper in equatorial than polar regions, so that in the latter the loss of heat by radiation would be in excess. This might of itself lead to convectional currents in the molten ocean. The effect on the atmosphere is very difficult to trace, but it is obvious that if a high-pressure area originated over some cooler region of the ocean, the winds blowing out of it would drive before them the cooler superficial layers of molten material; and as these were replaced by hotter lava streaming from below, the tendency would be to convert the high into a low-pressure area, and to reverse the direction of the winds. Conversely under a low-pressure area the in-blowing winds would drive in the cooler superficial layers of molten matter that had been swept away from the anticyclones. If the difference in pressure under the cyclonic and anti- cyclonic areas were considerable, some of the gas absorbed under the anticyclones might escape beneath the cyclones, and in a later stage of cooling might give rise to vast floating islands of scoria. Such islands might be the first foreshadowings of the future continents. Whatever the ultimate effect of the reaction of the winds on the currents of the molten ocean, it is probable that some kind of circulation was set up in the latter. The universal molten ocean was by no means homogeneous; it was constantly undergoing changes in composition as it reacted chemically with the internal metallic nucleus; its currents would streak the different portions out in directions which in the northern hemisphere would run from northeast to southwest, and thus the differences which distinguish particular penological regions of our planet may have commenced their existence at a very early stage. It is possible that as our knowledge extends we shall be able by a study of the distribution of igneous rocks and minerals to draw some conclusions as to the direction of these hypothetical lava currents Our planet was profoundly disturbed by tides, produced by the sun; for as yet there was no moon; and it has been suggested that one of its tidal waves rose to a height so great as to sever its connection with the earth and to fly off as the infant moon. This event may be regarded as marking the first critical, period, or catastrophe if we please, in the history of our planet. The career of our satellite, after its escape from the earth, is not known till it attained a distance of nine terrestrial radii; after this its progress can be clearly followed. At the eventful time of parturition the earth was rotating, with a period of from two to four hours, about an axis inclined at some 11° or 12° to the ecliptic. The time which has elapsed since the moon occupied a position nine terrestrial radii distant from the earth is at least fifty-six to fifty-seven millions of years, but may have been much more. Prof. Darwin's story of the moon is certainly one of the most beautiful contributions ever made by astronomy to geology, and we shall all concur with him when he says,A theory reposing on verse causae, which brings into quantitative correlation the length of the present day and month, the obliquity of the ecliptic, and the inclination and eccentricity of the lunar orbit, must, I think, have strong claims to acceptance.” The majority of geologists have long hankered after a metallic nucleus for the earth, composed chiefly, by analogy with meteorites, of iron. Lord Kelvin has admitted the probable existence of some such nucleus, and lately Prof. Wiechert has furnished us with arguments–”powerful” arguments Prof. Darwin terms them–in support of its existence. The interior of the earth for four-fifths of the radius is composed, according to Prof. Wiechert, chiefly of metallic iron, with a density of 8 2; the outer envelope, one-fifth of the radius, or about 400 miles in thickness, consists of silicates, such as we are familiar with in igneous rocks and meteorites, and possesses a density of 3.2. It was from this outer envelope when molten that the moon was trundled off, twenty-seven miles in depth going to its formation. The density of this material, as we have just seen, is supposed to be 3.2; the dens t.v of the moon is 3 39, a close approximation, such difference as exists being completely explicable by the comparatively low temperature of the moon. The outer envelope of the earth which was drawn off to form the moon was, as we have seen, charged with steam and other gases under a pressure of 5,000 pounds to the square inch; but as the satellite wandered away from the parent planet, this pressure continuously diminished. Under these circumstances the moon would become as explosive as a charged bomb, steam would burst forth from numberless volcanoes, and while the face of the moon might thus have acquired its existing features, the ejected material might possibly have been shot so far away from its origin as to have acquired an independent orbit. If so, we may ask whether it may not be possible that the meteorites, which sometimes descend upon our planet, are but portions of its own envelope returning to it. The facts that the average specific gravity of those meteorites which have been seen to Fall is not much above 3.2, and that they have passed through a stage of fusion, are consistent with this suggestion. SECOND CRITICAL PERIOD–” CONSISTENTIOR STATUS.” The solidification of the earth probably became completed soon after the birth of the moon. The temperature of its surface at the time of consolidation was about 1,170° C., and it was therefore still surrounded by its primitive deep atmosphere of steam and other gases. This was the second critical period in the history of the earth, the stage of the “consistentior status,” the date of which Lord Kelvin would rather know than that of the Norman Conquest, though he thinks it lies between twenty and forty millions of years ago, probably nearer twenty than forty. Now that the crust was solid there was less reason why movements of the atmosphere should be unsteady, and definite regions of high and low pressure might have been established. Under the high-pressure areas the surface of the crust would be depressed; correspondingly under the low-pressure areas it would be raised; and thus from the first the surface of the solid earth might be dimpled and embossed. It would be difficult to rtiscnps with sufficient brevity the probable distribution of these inequalities, hut it may be pointed out that the moon is possibly responsible, anrt that in more ways than one, for much of the exicsting geographical asymmetry. THIRD CRITICAL PERIOD–ORIGIN OF THE OCEANS. The cooling of the earth would continuously progress, till the temperature of the surface fell to 370° C., when that part of the atmosphere which consisted of steam would begin to liquefy; then the dimples on the surface would soon become filled with superheated water, and the pools so formed would expand and deepen, till they formed the oceans. This is the third critical stage in the history of the earth, dating, according to Prof. Joly, from between eighty and ninety millions of years ago. With the growth of the oceans the distinction between land ana sea arose–in what precise manner we may proceed to inquire. If we revert to the period of the consistentior status,” when the earth had just solidified, we shall find, according to Lord Kelvin, that the temperature continuously increased from the surface, where it was 1,170° C., down to a depth of twenty-five miles, where it was about 1,430° C., or 260* C. above the fusion point of the matter forming the crust. That the crust at this depth was not molten but solid is to be explained by the very great pressure to which it was subjected–just so much pressure, indeed, as was required to counteract the influence of the additional 260° C. Thus if we could have reduced the pressure on the crust we should have caused it to liquefy; by restoring the pressure it would resolidify. By the time the earths surface had cooled down to 370° C. the depth beneath the surface at which the pressure just kept the crust solid would have sunk some slight distance inward, but not sufficiently to affect our argument. The average pressure of the primitive atmosphere upon the crust can readily be calculated by supposing the water of the existing oceans to be uniformly distributed over the earth's surface, and then by a simple piece of arithmetic determining its depth; this is found to be 1.718 miles, the average depth of the oceans being taken at 2'393 miles. Thus the average pressure over the earths surface, immediately before the formation of the oceans, was equivalent to that of a column of water 1.718 miles high on each square inch. Supposing that at its origin the ocean were all gathered together into one place,” and “the dry land appeared,” then the pressure over the ocean floor would be increased from 1.718 miles to 2.393 miles, while that over those portions of the crust that now formed the land would be diminished by 1.718 miles. This difference in pressure would tend to exaggerate those faint depressions which had arisen under the primitive anti-cyclonic areas, and if the just soldified material of the earth's cruat were set into a state of flow, it might move from under the ocean into the buildings which were rising to form the land, until static equilibrium were established. Under these circumstances the pressure of the ocean would be just able to maintain a column of rock 0886 mile in height, or ten twenty-sevenths of its own depth. It could do no more; but in order that the dry land may appear, some cause must be found competent either to lower the ocean bed the remaining seventeen twenty-sevenths of its full depth, or to raise the continental buildings to the same extent. Such a cause may, I think, be discovered in a further effect of the reduction in pressure over the continental areas. Previous to the condensation of the ocean, these, as we have seen, were subjected to an atmospheric pressure equal to that of a column of water 1/718 miles in height. This pressure was contributory to that which caused the outer twenty-five miles of the earth's crust to become solid; it furnished, indeed, just about one- fortieth of that pressure, or enough to raise the fusion point 6° C. What, then, might be expected to happen when the continental area was relieved of this load Plainly a liquefaction and corresponding expansion of the underlying rock But we will not go so far as to assert that actual liquefaction would result; all we require for our explanation is a great expansion; and this would probably follow, whether the crust were liquefied or not. For there is good reason to suppose that when matter at a temperature above its ordinary fusion point is compelled into the solid state by pressure, its volume is very responsive to changes either of pressure or temperature. The remarkable expansion of liquid carbon dioxide is a case in point: 120 volumes of this fluid at –20° C. become 150 volumes at 33° G.; a temperature just below the critical point. A great change of volume also occurs when the material of igneous rocks passes from the crystalline state to that of glass; in the case of diabase the difference in volume of the rock in the two states at ordinary temperatures is 13 per cent. If the relief of pressure over the site of continents were accompanied by volume changes at all approaching this, the additional elevation of seventeen twenty- sevenths required to raise the land to the sea level would be accounted for.f How far down beneath the surface the unloading of the continents would be felt it is difficult to say, though the problem is probably not beyond the reach of mathematical analysis; if it affected an outer envelope twenty-five miles in thickness, a linear expansion of 4 per cent, would suffice to explain the origin of ocean basins. If now we refer to the dilatation determined by Carl Barus for rise in temperature in the case of diabase, we find that between 1,093° and 1,112° C. the increase in volume is 3.3 per cent. As a further factor in deepening the ocean asins may be included the compressive effect of the increase in load over the ocean floor; this increase is equal to the pressure of a column of water 0'675 mile in height, and its effect in raising the fusion point would be 2° C., from which we may gain some kind of idea of the amount of compression it might produce on the yielding interior of the crust. To admit that these views are speculative will be to confess nothing; but they certainly account for a good deal. They not only give us ocean basins, but basins of the kind we want, that is, to use a crude comparison once made by the late Dr. Carpenter, basins of a tea- tray form, having a somewhat flat floor and steeply sloping sides; they also help to explain how it is that the value of gravity is greater over the ocean than over the land. C. Harus.o names the material on which he experimented; apparently the rock is a french dolerite without olivine.. Prof. Fitzgerald has been kind enougb to express part of the preceding exphuultion in a more precise manner for me. He writes: H It would reire very uice adjustment of tempenltures and pressure. to work out. in t Ie simple way you state it; but what is really involved is that in a certain tate dIabase (and everything that chance state with a considerable chae of volume) hus an enorlllous isothermal compressibility.

900,"EVIL RISING: Disney now flat-out promoting demons and witchcraft to children

In accordance with its stated agenda of making the “demon realm feel like home,” The Disney Channel is releasing a new program for children called “The Owl House” that glorifies demons, witchcraft, and hell.

According to Disney, the series centers around a teenage girl named Luz who “discovers a portal to another realm where humans are not well-liked, and she must disguise herself in order to fit in at witch school.”

This realm, the kids programming empire says, is referred to as “Demon town,” and in it Luz decides to live with a demon named Eda the Owl Lady who’s “the most powerful witch on the Boiling Iles.”

Luz’s character decides during one of the earlier episodes of the show that, “Someday, I’m going to be just like her” – meaning Luz wants to grow up not to be an honorable human woman, but rather a demon witch like Eda.

The purpose of this storyline, of course, is to teach children whose parents let them watch The Disney Channel that being normal human beings is passé, and that it’s “cool” to discover portals that carry you off to hell to live with demons, witches, and even Satan himself.

“Folks, if you think this latest ‘Owl House’ show is just ‘fantasy and fun’ think again,” reads a commentary written by Deborah Bunting for CBN (The Christian Broadcasting Network).

“The show tries to portray witchcraft as a positive tool to fight evil,” she goes on to explains. “That’s similar to what real-life witches have been promoting over the past few years as they’ve been putting hexes on President Trump and others in order to fight for their beliefs.”

If you let your children watch The Disney Channel, you’re paving their way straight to hell

Many parents are simply unaware of this filth being peddled by Disney and The Disney Channel because they assume that the network resembles the Disney programming of old, which on its surface was clean and wholesome. In truth, Disney is actively indoctrinating child viewers into Satanism, using cartoon imaging as the lure.

“Over the years, Disney has gone farther and farther into the darkness of the spiritual world that opposes the living God, coming up with programming and characters that lead the vulnerable into that dark world of deception,” Bunting further warns. “This spiritual realm that opposes God is real. Demons are real.”

“And they are out to deceive your children and draw them in to be pawns of the enemy of their souls, the Devil, otherwise known as Satan,” she adds. “His devices and plans are to destroy your kids and grandkids spiritually, physically and emotionally. You must protect them from being enticed into this demonic world.”

Adam Hirsh, one of the voice actors on The Owl House, reportedly told Newsweek during a recent interview that the original pitch for the show was “girl hangs out with witch in hell.” Since most parents probably wouldn’t go for this, however, the network had to get creative.

It’s a lot like the Harry Potter book series, which is geared towards children with fun adventures, colorful storylines, and tailored writing specifically for little ears. But behind this thin façade is a world of darkness and depravity that sucks children in and consumes their souls.

“As ridiculous as the ‘demons’ contained in the book may be, there is nothing innocent or fun about even pretending to summon evil spirits,” says Elizabeth Johnston, also known as “Activist Mommy” on her blog.

“But who is to say it is pretend? The spirit world is real and is no laughing matter.”

A notable exorcist also told LifeSiteNews that this new Disney show is “a sign of the degeneration of our society,” which is pushing to make demons “acceptable” while ignoring “their malice and desire to do us harm.”

960,"Like few places on earth, Northern Ireland lives its history.

It is everywhere — on street signs, radio phone-ins, murals and marches. Like poisonous gas, it is inescapable: directing daily life. It determines whom you vote for, what sport you play, which part of the city you live in.

Stay at the multimillion pound Radisson Blu hotel in downtown Belfast and an Irish tricolor can be seen, stuck in a window of a flat in the “Markets” area — an Irish Catholic ghetto surrounded by Britishness and a derelict patch of grass. On the other side of the hotel, five minutes from the Markets, a giant Union flag mural welcomes (warns) visitors that they are entering the loyalist Donegall Pass area of town.

It is a society like no other in Western Europe. Different rules apply. Politically, it is more Balkan than British or Irish.

The 1998 Good Friday Agreement recognized this reality and sought a political system that could be all things to all people. Power was shared, with vetoes for both communities. The union with Great Britain maintained — even strengthened politically — but all-Ireland institutions created and nationalist rights guaranteed.

It created a land where you could be Irish or British — or both. You could shop on one side of the border and use the free NHS on the other.

It did not, however, change the fundamentals.

“Politics here are based on allegiance and identity,"" wrote the columnist Brian Feeney in the Irish News last week, days before the shooting of journalist Lyra McKee in Derry/Londonderry on Thursday night. “To pretend this place is like somewhere in England, and that one day … normal politics will somehow break out. Look, it’s not going to happen.”

The New IRA admitted responsibility for the killing on Monday — albeit with ""full and sincere apologies"" — a sign of the deadly tensions that are still simmering in Northern Ireland.

The old IRA — the Provisional IRA that was responsible for more than a thousand killings during the Troubles — is dormant. But dissident Republicans unhappy with the peace settlement remain. They are small in number but no less violent. Some fear that a political vacuum in Belfast is giving oxygen to the disaffection such groups need to survive.

There has not been an executive in Northern Ireland for 27 months and there is increasing concern power-sharing may be gone for good — the distrust between the two sides once again too great to bridge.

The main achievement of the Good Friday Agreement — the creation of power-sharing institutions — is not just unwell, but perhaps terminally ill.

Brexit is not the cause of the crisis, but is feeding into the mix — unsettling an already unsettled place.

Unlike almost anything else it creates a zero-sum dilemma, whereby any move one way or the other — away from Ireland or the rest of the U.K. — sparks the most existential fears of one community or the other.

The prospect of a no-deal Brexit and the imposition of border controls with the Republic of Ireland are a reminder that Northern Ireland is sovereign British territory. The backstop, which aims to ensure no border controls are needed, treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the U.K., raising unionist fears that it is the start of the slow drift to Irish reunification — and the dominance of Irish nationalists over Ulster unionists.

The old leaders who guided the peace process to its conclusion — and may have had the power and authority to save it now — are gone.

Northern Ireland is not well. The question is: Can a new generation of politicians make it better?

1323,"Married father-of-two David Black, 52, was shot several times from a car that pulled up alongside his on the M1 near Lurgan, Co Armagh, as he drove to work at Maghaberry jail yesterday morning.

Two men, aged 31 and 44, are being questioned by police after being arrested in the Lurgan area of Co Armagh.

Colleagues said Mr Black, from Cookstown, Co Tyrone, had been actively considering retirement after more than 30 years' service. He was a long-standing member of the Orange Order in Cookstown.

Stormont First Minister Peter Robinson last night branded the culprits ""flat-earth fanatics living in the dark ages, spewing out hatred from every pore"".

Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Edward Stevenson said he was the 337th member of the organisation to be murdered by terrorists since 1969.

""His professionalism throughout the worst of the Troubles and beyond is in stark contrast to the cowardly and faceless terrorists who today have left a wife without her husband and two children without their father,"" he said.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with David's wife, Yvonne, his children, Kyle and Kyra, and wider family circle at this deeply traumatic time.

""They can be assured that the Orange fraternity will rally around them in their hour of need.""

Prime Minister David Cameron joined political leaders on both sides of the Irish border in condemning what he said was a ""brutal murder"".

He said: ""These killers will not succeed in denying the people of Northern Ireland the peaceful, shared future they so desperately want.""

After being shot, Mr Black's black Audi A4 veered off the road and crashed into a deep drainage ditch.

Police have blamed dissident republicans opposed to the peace process.

The violent extremists have been engaged in a long-running protest campaign against conditions inside HMP Maghaberry in Co Antrim - Northern Ireland's only maximum-security prison.

Ministers from the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Republic's government will discuss the murder at a North South Ministerial Council meeting in Armagh today, according to the BBC.

Stormont Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness insisted the murder would not destabilise the peace process.

""Our community stands absolutely four-square and united against the activities of these groups,"" he said.

Mr Black has become the 30th prison officer killed in Northern Ireland since 1974, though the first for almost 20 years.

He was driving on the motorway between Portadown and Lurgan at about 7.30am when a dark blue Toyota Camry, with a Dublin registration, pulled alongside and several shots were fired.

Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable Drew Harris said dissidents had been actively targeting prison officers.

He indicated the gunshots, not the crash, had been the cause of death, adding: ""Mr Black appears to have sustained very serious and probably fatal gunshot wounds. The motive behind this is sheer terror.""

The Toyota believed to have been used in the attack - registration 94 D 50997 - was later found burnt-out in the Inglewood area of Lurgan, Co Armagh - a town with strong pockets of dissident support.

Mr Black's service stretched back as far as the 1981 IRA hunger strike inside the Maze prison when 10 republicans starved themselves to death.

PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott said it was a ""completely senseless attack"" that ""demonstrated the recklessness and ruthlessness and sheer dangerousness of those who oppose peace and are dedicated to taking us back to those dark days of the past"".

Prison Service director-general Sue McAllister said Mr Black had expressed interest in an early retirement scheme but his departure date had not been set.

She vowed the officer's colleagues would not be bowed by the attack.

Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers branded the attack on Mr Black ""cowardly and evil"".

""Like his colleagues across the Prison Service, he was dedicated to serving the whole community in Northern Ireland,"" she said.

""This is in stark contrast to the people responsible for this despicable crime.""

Irish Prime Minister, Taoiseach Enda Kenny, said the murder was ""deeply disturbing"".

""I utterly condemn the actions of those who carried it out and their scant regard for human life,"" he said while on an official visit to Berlin.

Mr Kenny added: ""Those who committed this brutal act will rightly be condemned by all civilised and right-thinking people on this island who utterly reject such hideous and mindless violence.""",mainstream
547,"Comets are fantastic celestial bodies that have captured our attention for centuries, and the rarer the comet, the more excitement it generates. When the Hale-Bopp comet passed within our view for 18 months in 1996-7, it brought with it the end of Heaven’s Gate’s time on Earth. Heaven’s Gate, was a religious group and later cult founded by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles in 1974, believed that a spaceship followed behind the Hale-Bopp comet and would be their key to “graduation from the Human Evolutionary Level,” that they would ascend to some higher being (“How and When it May be Entered”). On March 19-20, 1997, 39 members of the cult would commit mass suicide to be taken away on their supposed journey.

To briefly describe the beliefs of Heaven’s Gate members, its members thought that Earth was to be essentially restarted, and the only way to save their consciousness would be to ascend to a “Next Level” that Applewhite and Nettles themselves belonged to. Originally believing that a spaceship would come and deliver them to this Next Level, Nettles’ death in the 80s caused a slight shift that they would have to part with their bodies and humanity in order to ascend. This culminated in the belief in the ship following Hale-Bopp, and that by willingly leaving their bodies when the comet passed close to Earth, they would reach this ascension. Psychiatrist Marc Galanter and other scholars even stated that standard society generally accepted many of the concepts Applewhite based the cult’s ideas from. The group started in the 70’s, right during the UFO craze, so belief in extraterrestrials was not uncommon. Also, the idea of a higher existence, or Heaven, was and still is the backbone for the major religions that Applewhite pulled from. The typical member “accepted many of these ideas in isolation [but] were particularly intrigued by the way that Applewhite and Nettles had combined them” (“Death and Dying”). The facts against the belief are plentiful, without even delving into some of the more ridiculous claims. No spaceship was ever observed trailing Hale-Bopp. No evidence would support the existence of a higher human plane, let alone that Applewhite and Nettles came from it, and no evidence has been found that alien life even exists or visited us.

The member’s backgrounds largely play into how the cult even gained its footing. Since the group started in the 70s, many of its members consisted of hippies who at rejected the traditional religious dogmas and sought to “find themselves”. This gathering of people seeking to find themselves would largely contribute to the maintenance of the belief, and would give a sense of communal belonging that is similarly seen in Flat Earthers today. Often, even after leaving the group, former members typically still believed in the groups ideas, but just couldn’t maintain the disciplined lifestyle. One social influence and kind of syndrome that greatly contributed to the belief of Applewhite and Nettles was from “folie à deux” (“Death and Dying”). Sufferers of this syndrome have a shared sense of delusion, and reinforce each other’s delusion further. Additionally, the confirmation bias seemed to have a heavy hand in the formation of their early beliefs. The pair, already believing to have known each other in a past life, scoured the Bible and came to rely heavily on passages that would support their idea of the Next Level. They would even come to believe that they were the two witnesses referenced in the book of Revelations, that Applewhite was even the Second Coming, and Nettles the Heavenly Father.

The cognitive effect I found most interesting was the effect that cognitive dissonance had on the group after Nettles dies in 1985. This death and some post-hoc reasoning would ultimately result in the groups mass suicide more than a decade later. Before Nettles’ death, the group believed their bodies would leave with them to outer space, yet hers didn’t, even though she was already supposed to have been a part of the Next Level. In order for this to have not refuted the cult’s beliefs, a couple factors had to be present. First, the members had to have held these ideas really strongly, and have behavioral consequences. By this point, longtime members had changed the behavior and undergone activities to “limit human thoughts,” (“Death and Dying”) to prepare for their ascension. Second, they had to have taken drastic actions that are difficult to undo. Many had moved, cut off their families, and some men even castrated themselves – including Applewhite – to adhere to the strict lifestyle that their ability to ascend relied on. Third and fourth, the death absolutely refuted the belief, and the group members recognized that Nettles’ body didn’t ascend. Lastly, the members needed to have social support, which they found in the other members of the cult and most importantly, Applewhite. Thus, they came to the conclusion that the Nettle’s consciousness left her body when she died, and her ascended self was actually piloting a spaceship to eventually deliver the other members to their ascension. This would further their idea that they had to cast off all aspects of humanity in order to ascend, including their own bodies.

When Hale-Bopp came 12 years later, Applewhite realized that with it would come Nettles’ return and the group’s time to leave Earth. Finally, on March 19 and 20th, 39 people cast off their human body to reach the stars. The beliefs of Heaven’s Gate would come about with a shared delusion, the cherry picking of the bible and a group of religious strays, strengthen with the cognitive dissonance caused by a founder’s death, and then end with the coming of a magnificent comet.

649,"As far as failed predictions go, this one may be the original. Everyone knows the world is round, right? Not so. Homer thought it was flat. Ancient Buddhist cosmology agreed that earth was like a horizontal disk. Hebrew Scriptures suggested it might resemble a dome. Some in ancient China claimed it to be a square. And when Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492, many Europeans thought he might reach its edge. Some scholars suggest that a round-earth theory had more early support than one might think. Echoes of a round-earth cosmology can be heard in Plato, and 6th century B.C. Greek philosopher Pythagoras (yep, same a² + b² = c² guy) is said to have agreed. Around the time of Christ, an Asian belief held that the earth was like the yolk in an egg, and Muslim scholars supported a round earth by the 9th century. The Western world joined the round-earth campaign a little late, when Magellan's 1519 global voyage seemed to confirm the round hypothesis. Yet, as is the case with many strange predictions, a handful of believers like the Flat Earth Society still hold fast to their convictions. The rest of us would say however, they are, um, flat-out wrong.

1214,"An overlooked report has revealed the United States is completely reliant on imports from foreign countries, most heavily China, for rare earth minerals critical to our national security.

The report, released by the United States Geological Survey, stated the United States is 100% dependent on foreign imports for at least 20 elements and minerals, including 17 classified as rare earth minerals critical to the development of high-grade magnets used in aircraft and missile systems.

In addition to the use in military hardware, many rare earth minerals are critical for the development of GPS systems, satellite imaging, night vision goggles, and consumer products like smartphones and flat-screen televisions.

One country has a near monopoly over exporting rare earth minerals to the United States: China.

According to the report, the United States is 100% reliant on foreign countries (most notably the African nations of Gabon and South Africa) for the mineral manganese, which is used to make impact resistant steel.

Despite being readily available from mines in Arizona, Arkansas, and Minnesota, manganese can be imported more cheaply. There has been no domestic production of manganese since 1970.

“That 2017 USGS report is not fake news,” said George Byers, a 40-year veteran of the mining industry and an expert on rare earth minerals. “You have 29 or 30 studies on critical materials, including rare earths that go back to the early ‘90s. The outcome of each study is to declare ‘we have a crisis, let’s do something about it.’ But all they do about it, is to ask for another study.”

Molycorp, the only significant domestic producer of rare earth metals, went bankrupt in 2015 following a decision by the Obama administration to not bail it out of its $1.4 billion debt.

A Swiss investment firm linked to Vladimir Iorich, a Russian-born billionaire with German nationality, is reportedly attempting to purchase the Mountain Pass mine in California, the largest domestic source of rare earths once operated by Molycorp.

The trend of outsourcing control over rare earth minerals reached its peak in 1995, when the Clinton administration allowed two major domestic rare earth producers located in North Carolina and Indiana to go out of business and transferred their production capacity to China.

General Motors sold Magnequench, a company that used rare earth minerals to manufacture magnets critical for military weapons systems, in 1995 to a group of investors including the Soros Fund Management and two Chinese firms; five years later, the company opened a new plant in Tianjin, China.

Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) of has expressed plans to introduce a bill later this month to require the military to obtain rare earth minerals that are produced exclusively in the United States, even if it requires subsidizing companies involved in mining them.

“This is of critical importance to our national security and ability to stay ahead of everyone else,” he told Fox News. “Rare earth metals are crucial. We’ve closed down mines in my own state of California, which is the leading edge of stupid.”

“We need to have our own rare earths. The big sticking part of the bill is this. You have to put money in to subsidize our own product to create a market, because now there’s no market. We’ve got to put American manufacturing back in competition.”

Hunter’s bill would divert funds from developing aircraft and missile systems to supporting the domestic production of rare earth minerals. It would also provide five-year interest free loans to domestic producers, allowing them the opportunity to redevelop long-neglected facilities.

The threat of China cutting off the world’s supply of rare earth minerals is real.

“Absolutely, China could cut off the supply,” said Jeff Green, a defense industry analyst. “Processing rare earths is the end of the hose. China controls the spigot the hose is attached to.”

1290,"Once in a while, NASA releases a “shock photo” taken in space that UFO researchers pick apart to prove the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial beings and the crafts they occupy. There are plenty of official shock videos, too. Live-streaming cameras outside the Earth’s atmosphere are taken offline whenever something that shouldn’t be there appears.

Thanks to some intrepid ufologists – people who study the UFO phenomenon – images sometimes leak into the public domain. This just happened. A YouTube channel called UFOmania just released a NASA image of the planet Jupiter that shows a brightly-lit lime green “something” that appears to be just above or on the planet’s surface.

Skeptical observers like this writer are seldom impressed with photographic evidence of high strangeness in the skies above – or above the skies. However, this official image is a stunner. The unidentified object seems starkly out of place. Take a peek:

Before anyone says this image is a fake, here is the link to NASA

By any account, this object (or whatever caused the striking green coloration) is huge. UFO Hotspots attributes the green hue to “the effect of ionizing radiation” – in other words, Jupiter’s aurora borealis. Jupiter is thought to emit very strong ionizing radiation.

However, there is a problem with this theory that a high-energy particle impacted an imaging sensor and created the green anomaly. The problem is that the green whatever-it-is casts a shadow. This suggests that it is solid. The blown-up image looks like eight cubes stacked in two rows of four. The top row reflects a more yellow light than the bright green ones below.

The question is whether the object is a natural phenomenon or not. If not, is it biological, technological – or something completely different?

People have been speculating about advanced civilizations on and around Jupiter for decades. Noted astronomer Carl Sagan theorized that intelligent beings on Jupiter “would take the form of enormous balloon-like lifeforms that float above the hot gasses on Jupiter’s surface.”

Sagan continued his speculation by noting that “vast living balloons could stay buoyant by pumping heavy gasses from their interiors or by keeping their insides warm.” For sustenance, “they might eat organic molecules in the air or make their own with sunlight.” The host of the popular television show Cosmos: A Personal Voyage said these gaseous creatures would outstrip the largest Earth animal (the Blue Whale) and equal the size of an entire city.

Sagan also advised us, ‘way back in the 1970s, to look for regular architectural lines and features when analyzing surface images of planets and their satellites for signs of advanced intelligent life forms. This green object near Jupiter has almost chiseled features. Granted, minerals form crystalline structures, but this doesn’t look like a space rock, does it?

The well-known and much-beloved science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote extensively about the moons of Jupiter. In 1953, he published a short story Jupiter Five in If magazine. The action takes place in the Jupiter system. Clarke is famous for writing 2001: A Space Odyssey in 1968 which the brilliant filmmaker Stanley Kubrick turned into a stellar (pun intended) movie. The sequel to this story, 2010: The Year We Make Contact, takes place on one of Jupiter’s moons, Europa.

Public interest in UFOs is at an all-time high. Almost 26,000 viewers have watched the UFOmania video. Some observers wonder if NASA is under orders from high powers to release information showing the existence of an alien presence to further UFO disclosure which has long been a goal of many ufologists.

It is due to the ongoing work of investigators like Tyler with SecureTeam10 who presents compelling evidence that we are not alone in the universe.

1288,"YouTube will display links to Wikipedia and other “fact-based” sites along videos about “conspiracy theories”.

After demonetizing thousands of channels (many of which were “truther” and “conspiracy”-related), YouTube is now taking further steps to fight undesirable videos. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced this week that the video platform will soon begin displaying links to “fact-based” sites alongside conspiracy videos. Called “information cues”, these snippets of information will link to “reputable” articles in order to combat “hoaxes” and “fake news” stories (gotta use lots of quotation marks to highlight mass media’s biased vocabulary).

Here’s how it will work: If you search and click on a conspiracy theory video about, say, chemtrails, YouTube will now link to a Wikipedia page that debunks the hoax alongside the video. A video calling into question whether humans have ever landed on the moon might be accompanied by the official Wikipedia page about the Apollo Moon landing in 1969. Wojcicki says the feature will only include conspiracy theories right now that have “significant debate” on the platform. “Our goal is to start with a list of internet conspiracies listed on the internet where there is a lot of active discussion on YouTube,” Wojcicki said at SXSW.

 – Wired, YouTube Will Link Directly to Wikipedia to Fight Conspiracy Theories

The announcement comes shortly after YouTube was blamed for the distribution of “conspiracy theory” videos concerning the Florida shooting. In the wake of the event, the top trending video on YouTube was about crisis actors (notably David Hogg) appearing on camera. The video was quickly removed from the platform.

Using Wikipedia, a text-based, volunteer encyclopedia site, that can be edited by anyone, is a rather perplexing choice. While college and university students are prohibited from using the site as an information source due to reliability issues, Wikipedia will be used as a “fact-checking” site by YouTube. Maybe that’s because most Wikipedia articles completely deny most conspiracies. Although not officially announced, expect to see Snopes as another “fact-checking” site … Despite the fact that the site has a clear pro-elite agenda.

While YouTube’s new measure still allows the viewing of conspiracy videos, elite-owned sites such as Wired are already pushing for the outright banning of conspiracy theories on the platform.

31,"In its purest form, it's odorless, nearly colorless and tasteless. It's in your body, the food you eat and the beverages you drink. You use it to clean yourself, your clothes, your dishes, your car and everything else around you. You can travel on it or jump in it to cool off on hot summer days. Many of the products that you use every day contain it or were manufactured using it. All forms of life need it, and if they don't get enough of it, they die. Political disputes have centered around it. In some places, it's treasured and incredibly difficult to get. In others, it's incredibly easy to get and then squandered. What substance is more necessary to our existence than any other? Water.

At its most basic, water is a molecule with one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, bonded together by shared electrons. It is a V-shaped polar molecule, which means that it's charged positively near the hydrogen atoms and negatively near the oxygen atom. Water molecules are naturally attracted and stick to each other because of this polarity, forming a hydrogen bond. This hydrogen bond is the reason behind many of water's special properties, such as the fact that it's denser in its liquid state than in its solid state (ice floats on water). We'll look closer at these special properties later.

Water is the only substance that occurs naturally as a solid (ice), a liquid and a gas (water vapor). It covers about 70 percent of the Earth for a total of approximately 332.5 million cubic miles (1,386 million cubic kilometers) [source: U.S. Geological Survey]. If you're familiar with the lines ""Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink"" from the poem ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"" you'll understand that most of this water -- 97 percent of it -- is undrinkable because it's saltwater (see illustration on next page). Only 3 percent of the world's water supply is freshwater, and 77 percent of that is frozen. Of the 23 percent that is not frozen, only a half a percent is available to supply every plant, animal and person on Earth with all the water they need to survive [source: National Geographic].

So water is pretty simple, right? Actually, there ar­e a lot of things about it that scientists still don't fully understand. And the problem of making sure that enough clean, drinkable water is available to everyone and everything that needs it is anything but simple. In this article, we'll look at some of these problems. We'll also explore exactly what plants, animals and people do with water and learn more about what makes water so special.­",mainstream
1321,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc’s new iPhones will use recycled rare earth elements in a key component, the company said on Wednesday.

Apple said it will use recycled rare earths in its “Taptic Engine,” a part that lets iPhones mimic a physical button click despite being a flat pane of glass. The part is about one-quarter of the rare earth elements inside the iPhone models.

Rare earths, a group of 17 specialized minerals, have become a flash point in trade tensions between the United States and China. The elements are used in weapons, consumer electronics and other goods.

China dominates the processing of the raw minerals, and has implied through its state-controlled media that it could restrict rare earths sales to the United States, just as it did to Japan after a diplomatic dispute in 2010.

Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said Apple’s use of recycled rare earths was “not related” to trade tensions but could help it maintain a steady supply.

“This is one of those happy coincidences where what is good for the planet is really good for business at the same time,” Jackson told Reuters. “One of the things we talk about a lot internally, just in general, is how much more resilient this makes our supply chain.”

In consumer electronics, rare earths reside in tiny speakers and actuators. The parts are so small that collecting them for recycling is difficult and expensive.

For now, Apple will use recycled rare earths from an outside supplier, not from previously used iPhones. Apple declined to name the supplier or say what products the rare earths were recovered from, though the company did say the source was post-industrial, meaning material generated during manufacturing processes rather than from discarded consumer products.

Jackson said that Apple’s scale - new iPhone models are typically sell tens of millions of units per year - helped make the project economically viable.

“We have essentially made a market for this entrepreneur, this innovator, who found a way to recycle rare earths,” Jackson said.

Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company focused on repairing and reusing electronics, said Apple’s move was a first for the industry.

“Rare earth elements aren’t being recycled from electronics right now, and that’s a huge problem — China has a stranglehold on the virgin material supply,” Wiens said. “This is a great idea — Apple could single-handedly create a hugely needed market for recycled rare earths.”

Apple often aims to reuse parts from its old devices.

Apple said on Wednesday that aluminum from enclosures recovered through its trade-in programs will be melted down and made into new MacBook Air laptop computers. The company previously disclosed that cobalt recovered from iPhone batteries disassembled by robots at its recycling labs in Texas is put into new iPhone batteries.

Apple is experimenting with ways to recover rare earths from its phones using its robots, which can remove tiny parts and separate them into collection bins to aggregate enough material to make recycling viable.

The company is also researching ways that conventional recyclers, who shred devices and separate out the various materials, could tweak their lines to recover the elements, information that Jackson said Apple is open to sharing.

“There are some innovations of ours that we actually want people to copy. So as much as possible - as long as it doesn’t give away some of our other design and engineering innovation - we are happy to bring along the recycling industry,” Jackson said. “We have started to be much more transparent around this technology development than we usually are.”",mainstream
818,"Classical plate tectonic theory was developed in the 1960s.

It proposed that the outer layer of our planet is made up of a small number of rigid plates separated by narrow boundaries. The surface of Earth could be viewed as a simple jigsaw puzzle with just nine large plates and a bunch of much smaller ones.

Read more: Breaking new ground – the rise of plate tectonics

But what was glossed over when global plate tectonic models were first developed was the enormous deformation experienced by these seemingly rigid plates.

Fifty years after the plate tectonic revolution, we are pretty sure the continental parts of plates are not uniform, nor are they rigid. The giant forces that slowly move continents across the viscous mantle layer underneath, like biscuits gliding over a warm toffee ocean, stress the continents, and twist and contort the crust. This is a process that has taken place over millions of years.

As part of recent research, we worked with a team of international collaborators to build a computer model to show just how much the continents have been deformed since the Triassic Period, about 250 million years ago. The supercontinent Pangea began breaking apart soon after, ripping along the seams between Africa and North America.

We detail this new understanding of continent mangling in a paper published this month in the journal Tectonics.

We already knew that that colossal tectonic forces act along plate boundaries. We can see this when continents collide, such as when Africa collided with Eurasia, forming mountains like the Alps, or forming basins when continents are torn apart, as is happening in East Africa.

Our new research used geological and geophysical data to pinpoint all major zones of continental deformation, built into a global model of plate motions using our GPlates software.

We show that at least one third of all continental crust has been massively deformed since Pangea first started breaking up. That’s a whopping 75 million km2, roughly the size of North and South America and Africa combined.

Read more: Curious Kids: how do mountains form?

Deformed continental regions include large stretched and submerged continents like Zealandia, as well as crustal contraction where collisions have occurred, producing mountain belts such as the Himalayas, the European Alps, Iran’s Zagros Mountains and the southern Alps of New Zealand.

When crust is being thinned and stretched, the crustal contortions are usually hidden away from view because they are quickly covered up by sediments. But there are exceptions.

The East African Rift valley is one of the most spectacular examples of crustal extension visible at the surface. It has not subsided below sea level because the region is being pushed up by a mantle plume, a large upwelling of hot molten material causing uplift and volcanism.

The rift valley is underlain by a giant fault system that is splitting Africa in two. The rift turned a flat landscape into one with 4km high mountains and lake basins with vegetation ranging from desert to cloud forest. This variety of surface environments paved the way for the early evolution and diversification of humans.

We may not like stress in our daily lives, but the continuous stress and strain acting on continents provides us with an important record of Earth’s history.

Modelling the patterns of continental deformation through time allows us to explore regional patterns of earthquakes and volcanism and explain dramatic changes in Earth’s climate over time.

It also provides a framework based on tectonic data to seek mineral resources such as the metals cobalt and tungsten, which are needed for a sustainable energy future.",mainstream

Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 each had different trajectories planned, which meant they would each see different things along their journeys. Voyager 1’s mission was to fly by Jupiter and Saturn. While there, it discovered new moons, even ones covered in volcanoes (we see you Io).

1168,"What is Term Structure Of Interest Rates?

Term structure of interest rates, commonly known as the yield curve, depicts the interest rates of similar quality bonds at different maturities.

Essentially, term structure of interest rates is the relationship between interest rates or bond yields and different terms or maturities. When graphed, the term structure of interest rates is known as a yield curve, and it plays a crucial role in identifying the current state of an economy. The term structure of interest rates reflects expectations of market participants about future changes in interest rates and their assessment of monetary policy conditions.

In general terms, yields increase in line with maturity, giving rise to an upward-sloping, or normal, yield curve. The yield curve is primarily used to illustrate the term structure of interest rates for standard U.S. government-issued securities. This is important as it is a gauge of the debt market's feeling about risk. The most frequently reported yield curve compares the three-month, two-year, five-year, 10-year, and 30-year U.S. Treasury debt. (Yield curve rates are usually available at the Treasury's interest rate web sites by 6:00 p.m. ET each trading day),

The term of the structure of interest rates has three primary shapes.
• Upward sloping—long term yields are higher than short term yields. This is considered to be the ""normal"" slope of the yield curve and signals that the economy is in an expansionary mode.
• Downward sloping—short term yields are higher than long term yields. Dubbed as an ""inverted"" yield curve and signifies that the economy is in, or about to enter, a recessive period.
• Flat—very little variation between short and long term yields. Signals that the market is unsure about the future direction of the economy.

This yield curve is considered the benchmark for the credit market, as it reports the yields of risk-free fixed income investments across a range of maturities. In the credit market, banks and lenders use this benchmark as a gauge for determining lending and savings rates. Yields along the U.S. Treasury yield curve are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate. Other yield curves can also be developed based upon a comparison of credit investments with similar risk characteristics.

Most often, the Treasury yield curve is upward-sloping. One basic explanation for this phenomenon is that investors demand higher interest rates for longer-term investments as compensation for investing their money in longer-duration investments. Occasionally, long-term yields may fall below short-term yields, creating an inverted yield curve that is generally regarded as a harbinger of recession.

The Outlook for the Overall Credit Market

The term structure of interest rates and the direction of the yield curve can be used to judge the overall credit market environment. A flattening of the yield curve means longer-term rates are falling in comparison to short-term rates, which could have implications for a recession. When short-term rates begin to exceed long-term rates, the yield curve is inverted, and a recession is likely occurring or approaching.

When longer-term rates fall below shorter-term rates, the outlook for credit over the long term is weak. This is often consistent with a weak or recessionary economy, which is defined by two consecutive periods of negative growth in the gross domestic product (GDP). While other factors, including foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries, can also result in an inverted yield curve, historically, an inverted yield curve has been an indicator of an impending recession in the United States.",mainstream
1121,"DARPA is a driver of Technocracy in the 21st Century. Its creation of computerized microscopic sensors no larger than a spec of dust will surpass the Internet of Things (IoT) by orders of magnitude. Known as “SMART DUST”, an area can be blanketed to achieve 100% real-time monitoring of everything in every nook and cranny. Also, SMART DUST can be incorporated in fabric, building materials, paint or any other substance use in construction, decoration or wearables. It is injectable, consumable, drinkable and can be inhaled.

Smart Dust: Real-Time Tracking Of Everything, Everywhere

The idea of the Internet of Things is so passé. The general concept of the Internet of Things is that we can put a sensor on anything and have it send data back to a database through the Internet. In this way we can monitor everything, everywhere and build smarter systems that are more interactive than ever before.

Putting sensors on stuff? Boring. What if the sensors were in the air, everywhere? They could monitor everything—temperature, humidity, chemical signatures, movement, brainwaves—everything.

The technology is called SMART DUST and it’s not quite as crazy (or as new) as you might think. The earliest mentions of “smart dust” come from the RAND Corporation. According to Wikipedia:

We use the military anecdote above because it was these military research groups that first conceptualized SMART DUST but the practical application of the technology can be applied to almost any industry. Dust in the fields monitoring the crops. Dust in the factories monitoring the output of machines. Dust in your body monitoring your entire state of well being. Dust in the forests tracking animal migration patterns, wind and humidity.

The Rand Corporation has been involved in morally reprehensible warfare, think tank activity and strategy in particular, for several decades. They were involved in nuclear war strategy, disrespecting the lives of everyone on the planet in scenarios where nuclear bombs would be detonated to retaliate against Russia at the expense of all life on Earth.

Such apocalyptic scenarios are explored in many RAND publications, and in 2016, they examined possibilities of war with China. RAND has published several papers about spraying the skies, involuntarily treating whole populations with chemicals to geoengineer the weather. One is titled “Governing Geoengineering Research: A Political and Technical Vulnerability Analysis of Potential Near-Term Options.”

SMART DUST is made of “motes” which are tiny sensors that can perform a variety of functions. They are made of “microeletromechanical systems” known as MEMS. Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Emerging Technology describes the functionality of these motes:

Creating more advanced ways of conducting war has given humanity some of its biggest technological breakthroughs. Nuclear power, jet engines, radar and even the foundation of the Internet have been researched, developed and inspired by militarily focused groups. Dust sprung from this well. But it is by no means limited to military actions.

Researchers Kristofer Pister, Joe Kahn and Bernhard Boser at the University of California at Berkeley elaborate some potential uses in their research paper on the potential of Smart Dust.

SMART DUST may be deployed over a region to record data for meteorological, geophysical or planetary research. It may be employed to perform measurements in environments where wired sensors are unusable or lead to measurements errors. Examples include instrumentation of semiconductor processing chambers, rotating machinery, wind tunnels and anechoic chambers. In biological research, SMART DUST may be used to monitor the movements and internal processes of insects or other small animals.

With the recent announcement that the US government is looking into geoengineering research, it looks like an overt, involuntary treatment of the American people with geoengineering material is coming soon. Geoengineering researchers suspect that the tiny, metallic looking particles found after chemtrail spraying “may be” a form of SMART DUST. And they act as if they aren’t already spraying us with this technology.

RAND is likely to be involved with complex science used for control over populations, as implied in a publication of theirs. It reads,

The SMART agenda is is basically synonymous with the UN Agenda 21 and UN Agenda 2030, and the SMART GRID is synonymous with IoT (Internet of Things) which is also going to use 5G network to achieve its desired saturation levels.

Smart Dust technology has many potential and actual benefits that can revolutionize a wide array of industries ranging from ecological research, inventory control within an organization, various functions within an urban area and the military.
• It reduces the infrastructure and systems costs.
• It improves safety, efficiency and compliance in the workplace.
• It gives the farmers a better management of time.
• It helps in improving the fertilization management by considering the needs of crop.
• It minimizes the amount of defective products that come off of assembly.
• Other advantages are Equipment monitoring condition, asset monitoring, machine control and process monitoring and control.
• The biggest challenge being faced is of the privacy which needs to be handled properly.
• It has caused adverse environmental problems in certain applications.
• The sensors in the smart dust design are very costly and hence the cost of the systems goes high.
• One potential disadvantage may arise if the companies use smart dust that draws energy from radioactive sources. Though the researchers confirm that it would not have any harmful effects but the employees may refuse to work.

A technology that can be as dangerous as SMART DUST, geoengineering, etc, will certainly be used against public interests by the deep state and military industrial complex. While this technology can be used for the benefit of mankind, like so many other things, it has been weaponized. The existence of SMART DUST forms a massive threat to every human being alive. What we are up against is nothing less than the attempted technological possession of humanity.

The American public is so sedated by the mainstream narratives regarding independent investigations into the workings of the ruling elite that the UN Agenda 21/2030 and New World Order agenda are considered suspect at best and conspiracy theory fantasies at worst. Once the general public is coaxed into accepting something as “life-saving / life-altering”, from that point forward, people who criticize the science are ostracized. This is not science as in, the scientific method of critically testing the effects of something and searching for evidence, but it’s dogma about technology.

Hence, the issue needs to be addressed from a Christian perspective.

The word “therapy” is misleading. What it should be called is sexually stimulating people, because that is what's being done. It is sinful to “body massage” someone to whom you are not married, or to allow them to body massage you. We're not talking about a neck message, or a foot massage. The advertisement are for a full-body massage. It is sinful. No one should be massaging another person's body to whom they are not married. There is so much evil in society today that people just don't care anymore.
• Women get abortions because... “everybody else is doing it.”
• People, especially women, get divorced because... “everybody else is doing it.”
• People get body massages because... “everybody else is doing it.”
• People watch filthy movies because... “everybody else is doing it.”
• Women act in bed scenes for Hollywood because ...“everybody else is doing it.”
• People go commit evil in Las Vegas because... “everybody else is doing it.”
• Women dress like whores because... “everybody else is doing it.”

We'll, God's children WHO LOVE JESUS CHRIST are NOT doing it; and those who do will face the harsh judgment of God in eternity. Colossians 3:5-6 plainly lists several sexual sins that bring the judgment of God, “Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence [evil sexual desire], and covetousness, which is idolatry: For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.” America is a sex-sicko society. People are surrounded by sex everywhere they turn: TV shows, commercials, bus ads, internet ads, Hollywood movies, so-called Christian movies, et cetera.

The Bible tells us that the world was indulging in eating, drinking, and marrying in the days of Noah, before the flood (Matthew 24:37-38). The Bible says that they “knew not until the flood came, and took them all away.” Eating, drinking and marrying is not sinful by itself; unless you are ignoring God in your life. Those people in Noah's day ignored the preaching of Noah, didn't care about the things of God, didn't desire to know or obey THE TRUTH; and so they all died in their sins and went straight to Hell. Most Americans are spoiled rotten, enjoying fine-dining, massage parlors, hot-tubs, steam-rooms, Jacuzzis, Lazy Boy recliners, giant flat-screen TV's, surround sound; but they don't care about God. They will enjoy the cares, riches and pleasures of this life for a time; but they will be very regretful and sorry the day they die.

I was listening to a very popular radio host one day, who claims to be a Christian. He claims to deeply love God in every way. He is married with children. Yet one day I heard him tell his listeners that he goes to massage parlors from time-to-time, to have beautiful women massage him. I was saddened when he said that, wondering what kind of wife didn't care if her husband went to be massaged by other women. God is a jealous God, and something is wrong with anyone who is not jealous over their spouse. In America's sicko society today, where married couples “swing” with other couples sexually, it is horribly evil.

Only in a sinful, carnally-minded society do people go get a massage, letting someone of the opposite sex usually) put their hands all over you from head-to-toe. It is just plain wrong.

When I hear someone say that they're going to get a massage, I know that they're not right with God. Oh, I know, everyone has a bad back, or a bad leg, or some other health problem that they use to justify getting a massage; but it doesn't matter. It is sinfully for a man to have a woman putting her hands all over him (unless it's his wife). Massages are unscriptural and sinful, because they potentially arouse sexual desires (at least in a healthy, normal man) and often lead to sexual immorality during the massage. God calls all believers to a life of holiness.

A wife who doesn't mind if her husband gets a massage by another woman; probably dresses like a whore, has a loose past of fornication, approves of abortion, accepts homosexuality, et cetera. Only an immoral wife would approve of her husband getting a massage by another woman. You should be jealous over your spouse, just as God is jealous over His own (Exodus 20:1-5).

Massages are sinful. No one should touch you except your spouse. Even a man touching a man is creepy. No man should massage another man.",conspiracy
369,"Modern trends are predominantly driven by social media through popular hashtags, shared media, and online conversation. Prominent topics, events and pivotal moments can rarely be missed the second you’re confronted with your newsfeed. Much like Earth Day, World Oceans Day is a great way to raise awareness around climate change, and a momentous occasion that we too like to be a part of. In the name of World Oceans Day this year, we checked out Gerhard Richter’s exhibit; Seascapes at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain.

Seeking to create the perfect image, German-born artist Gerhard Richter created a series of ‘seascapes’ in different formats, colours and styles. Dominating each piece in the three-decade long collection, signature grey stuck with him throughout his career. Open to interpretation, when looking at each seascape, his work can be seen as either a controversy or clarity of the seas. In some cases, the horizon can barely be defined to those in which the realism of the sky is only distinguished by an ambiguous light.

Embellishing the landscape in his quest for perfection; in some works, the sky and the sea actually derive from two different images that Richter has fused together, leaving the viewer to depict the meaning behind the image. Gerhard mostly occupies much of the canvas with skies, which are occasionally eclipsed by the sea. Unlike most of his kind, Richter uses a spatula to make flat clouds, creating a smooth surface by applying highly diluted pigment and then blurring the image for a final touch. At first glance, the paintings appear as photographs, however, at a closer view, the details become abstract.

In his first work, entitled Seascape (Seestuck) from 1968, the small oil canvas displays an infinite horizon what then looks like white foam as the paint becomes thicker, revealing Richter’s brushstroke. In this instance, the work could be interpreted as a desert landscape, whereas the title tells us we’re seeing the ocean.

While in a later piece of work, Seascape (Wave) two-thirds of the canvas is covered with a stormy sky in varied shades of grey, and light emerges amidst the clouds as if it were a display of emotions. Illustrating a voice of the Earth perhaps?

Today, more than ever, our oceans need to be protected. Recklessness has left our seas at high risk, not to mention the wildlife that resides in it. World Oceans Day is out to help promote the future of the planet’s seas. Referred to as the lungs of the Earth, the purpose is to develop a worldwide movement to protect and manage the world’s oceans. Providing most of the oxygen we breathe, they’re a critical part of the biosphere and World Oceans Day is a celebration of the beauty, wealth and promise of the ocean.

Amidst a current climate emergency, some may interpret Richter’s work as a display of the turbulent times our planet is confronted with. Amongst moody skies and chopping waves, the images unveil the danger our seas face married with the beauty that lies within them.

491,"The US space agency NASA announced late Wednesday that scientists using a new verification technique on data from the Kepler telescope had discovered 715 additional planets.

The new finds ""almost certainly doubled"" the number of planets known to humanity, said NASA planetary scientists during a news conference.

905,"Neanderthals are an extinct species of hominids that were the closest relatives to modern human beings. They lived throughout Europe and parts of Asia from about 400,000 until about 40,000 years ago, and they were adept at hunting large, Ice Age animals. There’s some evidence that Neanderthals interbred with modern humans—in fact, many humans today share a small portion of Neanderthal DNA. Theories about why Neanderthals went extinct abound, but their disappearance continues to puzzle scientists who study human evolution.

Scientists estimate that humans and Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) shared a common ancestor that lived 800,000 years ago in Africa.

Fossil evidence suggests that a Neanderthal ancestor may have traveled out of Africa into Europe and Asia. There, the Neanderthal ancestor evolved into Homo neanderthalensis some 400,000 to 500,000 years ago.

The human ancestor remained in Africa, evolving into our own species—Homo sapiens. The two groups may not have cross paths again until modern humans exited Africa some 50,000 years ago.

In 1829, part of the skull of a Neanderthal child was found in a cave near Engis, Belgium. It was the first Neanderthal fossil ever found, though the skull wasn’t recognized as belonging to a Neanderthal until decades later.

Quarry workers cutting limestone in the Feldhofer Cave in Neandertal, a small valley of the Düssel River near the German city of Düsseldorf, uncovered the first identified Neanderthal bones in 1856.

Anatomists puzzled over the bones: Included among them was a piece of a skull which looked human, but not quite. The Neanderthal skull included a prominent, bony brow ridge and large, wide nostrils. The Neanderthal body was also stockier and shorter than ours.

In a 1857 paper, German anatomist Hermann Shaafhausen posited that the Neanderthal fossil belonged to a “savage and barbarous race of ancient human.” Seven years later, Irish geologist William King concluded that the Neanderthal fossil was not human and that it belonged to a separate species he named Homo neanderthalensis.

Fossil evidence suggests that Neanderthals, like early humans, made an assortment of sophisticated tools from stone and bones. These included small blades, hand axe and scrapers used to remove flesh and fat from animal skin.

Neanderthals were skilled hunters who used spears to kill large Ice Age mammals such as mammoths and wooly rhinos.

Little is known about Neanderthal culture and customs, though there’s some evidence that Neanderthals might have made symbolic or ornamental objects, created artwork, used fire and intentionally buried their dead.

Genetic analysis shows that Neanderthals lived in small, isolated groups that had little contact with each other.

Neanderthals had bigger brains than humans, though that doesn’t mean they were smarter. One recent study found that a large portion of the Neanderthal brain was devoted to vision and motor control.

This would have come in handy for hunting and coordinating movement of their stocky bodies, yet left relatively little brain space compared to modern humans for areas that controlled thinking and social interactions.

Most researchers agree that modern humans and Neanderthals interbred, though many believe that sex between the two species occurred rarely.

These matings introduced a small amount of Neanderthal DNA into the human gene pool. Today, most people living outside of Africa have trace amounts of Neanderthal DNA in their genomes.

People of European and Asian descent have an estimated 2 percent Neanderthal DNA. Indigenous Africans may have little or no Neanderthal DNA. That’s because the two species did not meet—and mate—until after modern humans had migrated out of Africa.

Some of the Neanderthal genes that persist in humans today may influence traits having to do with sun exposure. These include hair color, skin tone and sleeping patterns.

Neanderthals had been living in Europe and Asia for hundreds of thousands of years when modern humans arrived. Neanderthals were already adapted to the climate of Eurasia, and some experts think Neanderthal DNA may have conveyed some advantage to modern humans as they exited Africa and colonized points north.

Neanderthals went extinct in Europe around 40,000 years ago, roughly 5,000 to 10,000 years after first meeting Homo sapiens. There are several theories for their extinction.

Around 40,000 years ago, the climate grew colder, transforming much of Europe and Asia into a vast, treeless steppe. Fossil evidence shows that Neanderthal prey, including wooly mammoths, may have shifted their range further south, leaving Neanderthals without their preferred foods.

Humans, who had a more diverse diet than Neanderthals and long-distance trade networks, may have been better suited to find food and survive the harsh, new climate.

Some scientists believe that Neanderthals gradually disappeared through interbreeding with humans. Over many generations of interbreeding, Neanderthals—and small amounts of their DNA—may have been absorbed into the human race.

Other theories suggest that modern humans brought some kind of disease with them from Africa for which Neanderthals had no immunity—or, modern humans violently exterminated Neanderthals when they crossed paths, though there’s no archeological evidence that humans killed off Neanderthals.

569,"While a majority of Americans are dancing in the streets over Donald J. Trump becoming their next President and “Making America Great Again,” there are those in the Environmental movement and the Scientific community, that are expressing their concerns. Some concerns are justified, while other concerns that are being voiced raise a “Red Flag.”

We have to wonder how much of these expressed concerns are paranoia from those of “left leaning” political views… those with “Junk Science” in their portfolios (CYA)… and still others with an agenda that will not hold up under the light of day.

Some environmental planners spend their careers mapping out worst-case scenarios. As of January 20, they’ve got one in the White House.

There’s a case to be made that the Trump Administration’s rollback of environmental regulation won’t be devastating; that market forces will prevail in the coming energy revolution; that the environment and public health will continue to be protected under the EPA and other agencies, and that state governments will do their part as well; and that a newly-elected President, self-branded as an astute businessman and dealmaker, will be open to the wisdom of ensuring a safe and healthy America.

But there are two fatal flaws with this argument: 1) You weren’t born yesterday; and 2) You don’t come to this page to be lied to.

The Trump Administration’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall-to-wall collection of zealots, ideologues and latter-day Robber Barons. Their collective message, both stated and implied, is that the American government’s ability to protect the environment, already besieged and underfunded, is on the brink of oblivion.

In early December, the cavalcade of aspirants and celebrities seeking an audience at Trump Tower included two high profile climate activists, former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. Gore’s visit was brokered by the First Daughter-Elect, Ivanka Trump.

The Trump Administration’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall-to-wall collection of zealots, ideologues and latter-day Robber Barons.

 Upon exiting, Gore told the press gaggle that meeting with the Trumps was “extremely interesting.” Combined with Trump’s declaration to the New York Times that he had an “open mind” about climate change, the wilted spirits of environmentalists were revived. Kudos to Gore and DiCaprio for making their case, but now, let’s return to climate reality.

He’s not let them down, helping to lead a battle—against the agency he’ll be in charge of if approved—on the Clean Power Plan, the Waters of the United States definition (WOTUS). WOTUS and the Clean Water Act hold a particular irony, since the anticipated assaults on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act could make it easier to drain real, not metaphoric, swamps from coast to coast.

A day after Gore’s meeting, Trump announced the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (Pictured left/Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. In his six years on the job in Oklahoma, Pruitt has enjoyed the support of keystone local industries, including fossil fuel and poultry.

State: Next was ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who vaulted past the likes of Rudy Guiliani and Gen. David Petraeus for the Secretary of State nomination. Months away from Exxon’s mandatory 65 year-old retirement age, Tillerson was a man in search of a hobby. Tillerson has acknowledged that human-caused climate change is real, and has endorsed both a carbon tax and the Paris climate agreement. He’s an Exxon lifer, with 41 years in the employ of a corporation that’s buried its own science affirming climate change, and that still funds climate denial groups. But don’t think he’s inexperienced in government or foreign policy. Steve Coll’s must-read 2012 book “Private Empire” makes the compelling case that Exxon functions as a sovereign petro-state, leveraging diplomatic pressure in virtually every corner of the Earth.

All told, the CEO of Exxon looks to be the most progressive voice on climate change in the Trump Administration. The CEO of Exxon. As Elizabeth Kolbert, the Pulitzer-winning New Yorker writer observed, “You have to be pretty desperate – and at this point many people are – to take this as cause for optimism.”

Related: He’s no Ronald Reagan DOE: Editorial cartoonists and late-night comics love Rick Perry, who, as its potential boss, probably now remembers that Department of Energy was one of those agencies he’d like to abolish.

The former Texas governor is actually a big fan of wind power, which he watched become a booming industry in his state. “You can be proud that Texas produces more energy from wind turbines than all but five countries,” he boasted upon leaving office in 2015.

He ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking as well, and last year joined the Board of Directors of Energy Transfer Partners, the builders of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Perry (Pictured left/Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) has also said that climate science is a conspiracy to keep climate scientists as wealthy as we all know that they are. While DOE has been home to groundbreaking clean energy research, the bulk of the department’s mission and budget goes to maintaining the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, and cleaning up the immense messes left by their manufacture.

Since leaving the Texas State House, Perry has kept himself busy with an unsuccessful appearance on “Dancing With the Stars,” and by turning back a criminal indictment for abuse of power as Governor. Step lightly, Guv.

Interior: Ryan Zinke (Pictured below/ Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) is a first-term Montana congressman who accepts that climate change is real. In the past, he’s called climate change a “threat multiplier,” but that Obama’s climate strategies would unleash “catastrophic” economic costs.

An avid hunter, Zinke says he’d like to see more intensive use of federal lands by both sportsmen and oil and gas drillers, and is expected to favor opening controversial export terminals to ship Montana and Wyoming coal across the Pacific. He does have credentials as a “hook and bullet” conservationist, including support for the crucial Land and Water Conservation Fund. That’s earned him opposition from western anti-environment groups like the American Land Rights Association.He earned a 3 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters in 2015. Unlike many on the Trump team, he’s voiced opposition for turning federal lands over to states.

Rick Perry ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking and last year joined the Board of Directors of Energy Transfer Partners, the builders of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Justice: If approved, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions would serve as Attorney General. He’s said that efforts to bring clean energy to developing nations would be a veritable assault on the world’s poorest people. He believes CO2 is a benign “plant food,” and famously launched a bizarre interrogation of EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy earlier this year.

Enough about the energy/environment bosses. The secondary players may be considerably worse. Many of these items are taken from first-rate reporting by Lyndsey Gilpin of High Country News, and research by Jenny Rowland and Erin Auel at the Center for American Progress. The CAP researchers documented that nearly every key member of the transition teams for EPA, Interior, and DOE worked for Koch-funded organizations or office-holders.

Energy: Thomas Pyle, a former lobbyist for both Koch Industries and the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, leads the transition team. He currently runs the Koch- and Exxon-funded Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that’s espoused a loosening of energy regulations and climate denial while denouncing wind energy.

A special moment came on December 14, when Energy transition team member Anthony Scaramucci appeared on CNN.

Anthony Scaramucci, a financial CEO and Fox Business News contributor, mixed it up with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo in mid-December. Cuomo repeatedly asked his guest about whether climate change is real. Citing Flat Earth Theory, Scaramucci took a deep dive into the manufacture of doubt.

Funny thing: Scaramucci was asked the same question six months ago and declared climate science to be “irrefutable.” For good measure, and possibly with his new boss in mind, he added back in June, “I find it tragic that so many people in this country believe global warming is some sort of elaborate hoax perpetuated by every credible scientist on the planet.”

Other Energy Department transition officials include two more former Koch Industries lobbyists, Mike McKenna and Mike Catanzaro. Catanzaro also served a stint as Communications Director for uber-denier Sen. James Inhofe. Team member William Greene is Deputy Legislative Director for the Safari Club International, which has lobbied for trophy-hunting exemptions from the Endangered Species Act.

Transitioner Daniel Simmons comes from two Koch-funded groups, IER and ALEC.

Somewhere on this DOE team, an unidentified someone has been “counseled.” Those were the announced consequences for distributing a questionnaire to DOE employees that, among other things, sought to identify anyone at the agency who had participated in climate-related meetings.

After an uproar, and a refusal by current DOE staff to comply, the Trump team disowned the questionnaire and its McCarthy Era overtones (In fairness to Senator Joe McCarthy, he was nowhere near as forgiving with the Russians).

NASA Transition head Chris Shank is the #2 staffer to House Science Committee Chair Lamar Smith, and is expected to steer the agency away from its vital Earth science and climate change research.

Commerce: The Commerce Department’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is NASA’s government counterpart in climate research. Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross has made billions on rescuing and leveraging distressed companies, including coal, oil and gas firms. He’s acknowledged that climate change is a thing, offering suggestions to boost rail traffic and invest in ethanol as climate fixes.

Ross’s International Coal Group owned the Sago Mine in West Virginia. In January 2006, 13 miners were trapped in an explosion at the mine. Only one was rescued. In 2011, Ross sold ICG to Arch Coal for a reported $3.4 billion.

There’s little indication that NOAA’s climate science is nearly as much in the crosshairs as NASA’s. But, as one former Commerce official told me, “maybe they just haven’t gotten to it yet.”

EPA: Myron Ebell is a veteran political operative guiding EPA’s transition team. Ebell dodges the “denier” label via a few old climate-denial standards: In the past, he’s either said that climate change is “nothing to worry about,” or that it will be awesome when fewer people die from the cold in a warming world.

When hackers stole thousands of emails from climate scientists in 2009, Ebell described the climate science community as a “gang” that was “without honor.” Multiple investigations cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing.

Also on the team are attorneys David Schnare and Chris Horner of the American Tradition Institute. Schnare and Horner have specialized in filing lawsuits and sweeping Freedom of Information Act requests against prominent climate scientists. Bankruptcy filings by coal companies have revealed their funding for Schnare’s and Horner’s work.

National Security Team: K.T. McFarland, (Pictured left/Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) another Fox contributor, would become Deputy National Security Advisor. She’s denounced the Obama Administration for citing climate change as a global security issue.

Monica Crowley, still another appointee drained from Fox News, will handle the press for National Security Advisor Mike Flynn. She recently called global warming “a way of separating Americans and Westerners from God and organized religion, and it’s also a wealth redistribution scheme.”

CIA: Wichita-based Congressman Mike Pompeo counts on David and Charles Koch as his constituents. He’s been a business partner with Koch Industries through an oil supply firm, and has said that President Obama is “horribly wrong” about climate change posing a global security risk.

Interior: Doug Domenech is a former Virginia state official who blames the “regulatory war on coal” for tough times in Appalachia, and says that the miracle mineral can relieve energy poverty. But coal jobs have been on a steady swan dive since the Reagan Administration due to mechanization.

Other Interior transition staffers include attorney Daniel Jorjani, who works for the Koch’s Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce. Authors Alyssa Katz describes this effort as having bankrolled anti-regulatory campaigns by the U.S. Chamber and others with $255 million in 2012 alone.

Congressional staffer Harlan Watson served as chief climate negotiator under President George W. Bush. A leaked memo from ExxonMobil, written shortly after Bush’s inauguration, sang Watson’s praises and recommended him for a role in climate policy.

And a few more: As Transportation Secretary-designate, Elaine Chao would lead on major infrastructure projects, including the Obama Administration’s plans to ramp up electric vehicle charging stations nationwide. Chao resigned her seat on the Bloomberg Philanthropies Board in 2015 when the charity decided to increase its support of the Sierra Club’s “Beyond Coal” campaign. She is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – a helpful reminder that sometimes, guilt by association means that you’re guilty.

Linda McMahon, nominee for the Small Business Administration, has cited “conflicting science on both sides of this issue.” The former World Wrestling Entertainment executive didn’t go so far as to declare climate science is fake and has a predetermined outcome.

Senior Counselor Steve Bannon’s Breitbart News site regularly touts climate denial. Bannon accused the Pope of “hysteria” for embracing climate action. Domestic transition head Ken Blackwell believes that climate models are rigged, and the science is a “hoax.” HUD nominee Ben Carson has said there’s “no overwhelming science” on climate change. Chief of Staff Reince Preibus said “melting icebergs aren’t beheading Christians in the Middle East.” UN Ambassador nominee Nikki Haley fought the Clean Power Plan as South Carolina Governor, even as her state endured lethal, record-smashing downpours. And Vice President-Elect Mike Pence has at times said climate change is real, but that government policy can’t impact it. But he’s also called it a “myth.”

698,"The Acropolis of Athens is one of the most famous ancient archaeological sites in the world. Located on a limestone hill high above Athens, Greece, the Acropolis has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Over the centuries, the Acropolis was many things: a home to kings, a citadel, a mythical home of the gods, a religious center and a tourist attraction. It has withstood bombardment, massive earthquakes and vandalism yet still stands as a reminder of the rich history of Greece. Today, it is a cultural UNESCO World Heritage site and home to several temples, the most famous of which is the Parthenon.

What Is the Acropolis?

The term “acropolis” means “high city” in Greek and can refer to one of many natural strongholds constructed on rocky, elevated ground in Greece, but the Acropolis of Athens is the best known.

Made of limestone rock that dates to the Late Cretaceous period when dinosaurs still roamed the earth, the Acropolis is located on the Attica plateau of Greece and includes four hills:

How Old is the Acropolis?

The Acropolis’ flat top is the result of thousands of years of construction beginning as far back as the Bronze Age.

There’s no recorded history of what happened at the Acropolis before the Mycenaeans cultivated it during the end of the Bronze Age. Historians believe the Mycenaeans built a massive compound surrounded by a great wall (almost 15 feet thick and 20 feet high) on top of the Acropolis to house the local ruler and his household.

Years later, the Athenians built a Doric temple made of limestone, known as Bluebeard Temple, on the northeast side of the hill in honor of the goddess Athena in the sixth century B.C. It was named after a sculpture that adorned the building that depicted a man-serpent with three blue beards.

Another temple dedicated to the Athena was also erected in the same century, as was a shrine to Artemis Brauronia, the goddess of expectant mothers in Greek mythology.

During the Greek Dark Ages (800 B.C. to 480. B.C.), the Acropolis remained largely intact. Many religious festivals were held there, and the artifacts of the time reflected the grandeur of ancient Athens.

Around 490 B.C., the Athenians started building a majestic marble temple known as the Old Parthenon. By that time, the Bluebeard Temple had been demolished by the Persians.

In 480 B.C., the Persians attacked again and burned, leveled and looted the Old Parthenon and almost every other structure at the Acropolis. To prevent further losses, the Athenians buried the remaining sculptures inside natural caves and built two new fortifications, one of the rock’s north side and one on its south.

If the Acropolis was impressive during the Mycenaean Civilization, it was nothing short of spectacular during the Golden Age of Athens (460 B.C. to 430 B.C.) under the rule of Pericles when Athens was at its cultural peak.

Determined to bring the Acropolis to a level of splendor not seen before, Pericles initiated a massive building project that lasted 50 years. Under his direction, two well-known architects, Callicrates and Ictinus, and renowned sculptor Phidias helped plan and execute the Pericles’ plan.

Pericles didn’t live long enough to see his entire Acropolis vision come true, but temple builders and architects continued working until they completed the project. The southern and northern walls were rebuilt and some of the most iconic structures in the world were constructed such as:

The Parthenon: An enormous Doric-style temple that remains the star attraction of the Acropolis. It featured ornate sculptures and housed a spectacular statue of the goddess Athena.

The Propylaea: A monumental entryway to the Acropolis that included a central building and two wings, one of which was covered with elaborately painted panels.

The Temple of Athena Nike: A small Ionic-style temple located to the right of the Propylaea built as a shrine to Athena Nike.

The Erechtheion: A sacred Ionic temple made of marble which honored Athena and several other gods and heroes. It’s best known for its porch supported by six Caryatid maiden statues.

The Statue of Athena Promachos: A gigantic (almost 30 feet tall) bronze statue of Athena that stood next to the Propylaea.

The Acropolis saw few changes after Sparta won the Peloponnesian War, although a minor temple honoring Caesar Augustus and Rome was built in 27 B.C.

Many of the original buildings of the Acropolis were either repurposed or destroyed. In the sixth century A.D., after Rome converted to Christianity, many temples at the Acropolis became Christian churches. The Parthenon was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and the Erechtheion became a chapel.

As Greece endured many unwelcome invaders, including the Venetians and the Turks, the Acropolis and its temples also served as mosques and storehouses for ammunition. The Propylaea was a residence for Episcopalian clergy and later, the ruler of the Ottomans. It also once served as barracks for the Turkish occupying army.

On September 26, 1687, the Venetians bombarded the Acropolis and decimated the Parthenon, which was a powder munitions depot at the time, leaving it at the mercy of looters, vandals and even tourists; many priceless artifacts were lost.

In 1801, hoping to save the Parthenon’s architectural magnificence, the seventh Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, began removing its sculptures with permission from the occupying Turkish government.

Elgin eventually removed over half of the Parthenon’s sculptures, known as the Elgin Marbles, and sold them to the British Museum where many still reside today. The Greek government strongly disapproves of the artifacts remaining in the hands of the British and feels the sculptures should be returned to Athens.

After the Greek War of Independence in 1822, the Acropolis was returned to the Greeks in disrepair. They began investigating the condition of their crown jewel and meticulously excavated the entire site in the late nineteenth century. At the turn of the twentieth century, restorations began.

In 1975, the Committee for the Conservation of the Monuments on the Acropolis was established which includes architects, archaeologists, chemical engineers and civil engineers. The Committee, along with the Acropolis Restoration Service, works to document and conserve the history of the Acropolis and restore its structures as closely to their original state as possible.

They also work to minimize environmental damage caused by pollution and weathering and identify ways to limit future damage. The restorations of the Erechtheion and the Temple of Athena Nike are complete.

The Acropolis is open to tourists year-round and is located in a busy area of the city of Athens. Tickets are available at the entrance, but be prepared to wait. To miss the crowds and the summer heat, arrive early in the morning or after 5:00 p.m.

Most importantly, bring comfortable shoes and water because exploring the Acropolis requires a lot of walking. Keep in mind that some buildings may be inaccessible due to renovations.

856,"To the editor: In these times of the Flat Earth Society, climate change deniers and anti-vaxxers, for the Los Angeles Times to print a front-page article that comes across as supportive of the benefits and healing powers of the “magic” performed by witches does the community a disservice.

The nonsense of New Age medicine has been well documented for years now.

The Oracle is incorrect when she says that “magic does not defy the laws of physics.” This is precisely what they expect you to believe magic does. All their white noise about trances and energy and spirit guides just obfuscates the fact that they are preying on people who may possibly need real help from licensed psychiatrists.

While it may be argued that these witches are not doing any real harm, the potential is definitely there. Keeping someone away from a trained practicing doctor could exasperate or prolong conditions that are professionally treatable.

An doctor friend of mine often asks me, “What do you call alternative medicine that works?” The answer, of course, is medicine.

To the editor: I am not a witch, but I very much appreciate your article on the witches of Los Angeles.

I and many others appreciate the change in attitude we are seeing in the media for folks who have found strong spiritual support along paths that do not belong to the “official religions.”

To the editor: I guess there was nothing happening in the Senate this week. Same for the House, Sacramento, City Hall, Europe, Asia and Africa.

There was no real news, because the L.A. Times decided to publish front-page pieces on witches and the O.J. Simpson case.

714,"To understand pistorius and Steenkamp, to understand South Africa, it helps to know the place where the couple chose to spend their holiday. Cape Town has arguably the most beautiful geographical feature of any city in the world: Table Mountain, a kilometer-high, almost perfectly flat block of 300 million-year-old sandstone and granite that changes from gray to blue to black in the golden light that bathes the bottom of the world. From Table Mountain, the city radiates out in easy scatterings across the olive, woody slopes as they plunge into the sea. Its central neighborhoods are a sybarite's paradise of open-fronted cafés and pioneering gastronomy, forest walks and vineyards. Commuters strap surfboards to their cars to catch a wave on the way home. The business of the place is media: fashion magazines, art studios, p.r., advertising, movies and TV. Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy just wrapped the new Mad Max movie. Action-movie director Michael Bay is shooting Black Sails, a TV prequel to Treasure Island.

But while Cape Town's center accounts for half its footprint, it is home to only a fraction of its population. About 2 million of Cape Town's 3.5 million people live to the east in tin and wood shacks and social housing built on the collection of estuary dunes and baking sand flats called the Cape Flats. Most of those Capetonians are black. Class in Cape Town is demarcated by altitude: the farther you are from the mountain, the lower, poorer and blacker you are. Cape Town's beautiful, affluent center is merely the salubrious end of the wide spectrum that describes South Africa's culture and its defining national trait: aside from the Seychelles, the Comoros Islands and Namibia, South Africa is the most inequitable country on earth.

This stark gradation helps explain South Africa's raging violent crime (and why, contrary to legend, Cape Town actually has a higher murder rate than Johannesburg). In 2011 the U.N. Office for Drugs and Crime found that South Africa had the 10th highest murder rate in the world. Rape is endemic. Two separate surveys of the rural Eastern Cape found that 27.6% of men admitted to being rapists and 46.3% of victims were under 16, 22.9% under 11 and 9.4% under 6--figures that accorded with the high proportion of attacks that occurred within families.

But what really distinguishes South Africa from its peers in this league of violence is not how the violence rises with inequality nor its sexual nature--both typical of places with high crime--but its pervasiveness and persistence. With the exception of Venezuela, all the other top 10 violent countries are small African, Central American or Caribbean states whose populations tend to be bound together in close physical proximity, creating tight knots of violence. South Africa, on the other hand, knows crime as a vast stretch of lawlessness covering an area twice the size of France or Texas. And it has been that way almost as long as anyone can remember.",mainstream
44,"""Bachelorette"" contestant Lincoln Adim set himself apart from the rest of the competition in a unique way during the latest season’s fourth episode by asserting that the Earth is flat.

“When you look out of a plane, everything is flat,” the 26-year-old account sales executive from Los Angeles pointed out to the other contestants on Monday night's episode. “Why does the water not fall on humankind if it’s on top of us?”

When the other contestants asked how people managed to sail around the world, he answered: “By just traveling… and friction and gravity.”

Fans on Twitter quickly took notice of the comments.

Despite his outspoken flat-earth sentiments, he was not eliminated.

His conviction for indecent assault and battery a week before joining the show for allegedly “groping and assaulting an adult female on a harbor cruise ship” in 2016 wasn’t a deal-breaker either.

The news about his criminal record was especially controversial as neither bachelorette Becca Kufrin nor the producers reportedly knew about the charges before Adim was cast.

In reference to the charges and the manner in which they were exposed, fellow contestant Connor Obrochta told TMZ that Lincoln should stay away from the eventual “Tell-All” episode for his own safety.

“Some of the other guys are more ruthless than me,” he said. “When they hear something like this it rubs them the wrong way.”

Adim isn’t the only source of controversy this season, as Garret Yrigoyen, the recipient of the coveted first-impression rose, earned considerable flak for liking posts on Instagram that mocked immigrants, Parkland students, transgender people and liberals, among others.

Kufrin told the audience to keep an open-mind in an interview with Entertainment Tonight after the news broke, and Yrigoyen has since apologized.

With Adim’s inclusion in every episode and a definite spot in the next, it appears neither his understanding of the Earth’s shape nor his sexual misconduct hurt his stock. Only time will tell whether any of it will catch up to him.",mainstream
219,"If you can’t find me,” Meng Zhaoguo said over a cell phone whose signal faded from its isolation, “Just head to the last house on the logging commune lane. Or ask anyone who’s around.” Everyone knows the first Chinese person to allegedly be abducted by aliens.

With its surging economy, China is summiting once-unseen heights in world rankings:millions of English speakers.almost the most millionaires and actually the least frugal tourists.

I first visited Meng at his home on the Red Flag Logging Commune, set among the remains of a forest in China’s far northeast, an area historically known as Manchuria. Chinese characterize Northeasterners as big-hearted, industrious and sometimes a bit touched in the head. So it was not a shock when the nation’s first person claiming interstellar relations came from here. In 2003, I traveled over a winding, ice-covered, one-lane road through the forest to meet him.

On the commune, Meng lived in a two-room timber frame house he had built with his own hands. Bare yellow light bulbs dropped from the ceiling, and there was no phone — or cell reception. But a big-screen Sony television filled one end of the room.

“Out here, it only picks up two channels,” he said. “So it’s a waste of money, but I didn’t buy it. A businessman brought it, after he heard about my story.” Another visitor, from Malaysia, had brought him a cow. “I sold that,” Meng told me. “Cows cost money to take care of. What am I going to do with a cow out here?”

We stepped outside, boots crunching snow, and faced the Dragon Mountains, veiled in purple mist as the day’s light faded. Meng said that on a night much like this in 1994, he saw a metallic glint shimmer off those peaks.

“I thought a helicopter had crashed, so I set out to scavenge for scrap.” He made it to the lip of a valley, spying the wreckage in the distance, when “Foom! Something hit me square in the forehead and knocked me out.”

He awoke at home, he told me, with no memory of how he got there. A few nights later he woke to find himself floating above his bed. As his wife slumbered beneath him, a 10-foot-tall, 6-fingered alien woman with thighs coated in braided hair straddled his waist. Meng and the alien copulated for 40 minutes.

“She then disappeared through the wall and I floated back down to bed. She left me with this.” He undid his trousers to reveal a two-inch-long jagged mark that he insisted bore only a coincidental resemblance to a scar resulting from a slipped stroke of a saw.

I asked him to draw the creature, and he took my pen and tore off a sheet from a roll of rough, unbleached paper. To my surprise, I recognized the alien. As he made tiny x’s on the alien’s inner thighs, I realized Meng was sketching a hairy cousin of the Michelin Man. His smiling, puffy white face waved from atop an auto repair shop at the base of Red Flag Logging Commune. I thought of that, and the empty crates of Five Star beer stacked just outside Meng’s front door, and the remote loneliness of a Northeast winter.

But Meng told the story calmly, not in a desperate or pleading tone, cajoling the listener to believe. I kept my deductions internal, and he suggested we go outside with his kids and light the fireworks I had brought for them. That night I slept fitfully on Meng’s bed, while he took the couch.

“‘In 60 years, on a distant planet, the son of a Chinese peasant will be born.’”

After Meng’s story circulated among enthusiasts, the media came calling, leading to his appearance in national newspapers and on television. He was even the subject of a debated Wikipedia page, which listed different versions of his story, including being taken to the aliens’ home planet of Jupiter, and “ongoing harassment” from the extraterrestrials.

“Journalists look for discrepancies in my story,” he told me the next morning at his house. “I get tired of telling it. In the end, I’m just a peasant.”

Meng added that a month after the alien had visited him, he again awoke to find his body passing through the world map hanging over his bed. He levitated through the stratosphere and into a spaceship, where aliens circled him.

“They said in Chinese, but with a heavy accent so it was hard for me to understand at first, that they were refugees. Like me, they wanted to escape their former lives, so they left their dying home.”

That echoed the tales of many Chinese migrants, including Meng’s desire to move his family off the defunct Red Flag Logging Commune.

Meng asked to see his alien paramour, the one with braided hair on her inner thighs.

“‘Impossible,’ they replied. But then they said something that made me hopeful. ‘In 60 years, on a distant planet, the son of a Chinese peasant will be born.’”

This was a stroke of genius: Meng had introduced Chinese class-consciousness to outer space. (He also made sure few people who heard his tale today would be around to see its proof). And while my Northeastern-born wife declared his story a lesson in the “Art of Northeastern Bullshitting,” the story was also an example of self-invention, transporting Meng, his wife and children from the last house on a logging commune lane to a metropolitan campus after a university official reached out and offered him a job.

“Humans, if we have never seen something with our own eyes, naturally doubt that it exists, or that life could be that way. I was the first to be brave enough to say: ‘I saw that.’”

When I sought him out there when researching my book —””in Manchuria: AVilage called wasteland and the transformation of Ruaral China” — in Harbin city a decade later, he again told me to head to the last building on the lane, or just ask anyone where he was. Everyone knew the first Chinese person to be abducted by aliens.

There he stood, in full grin. “I am very happy to work here,” he said. “It’s quiet. I’m in charge of the boiler and watch the steam pipes.” It was a better job than felling trees, which were now protected. His coworkers at Red Flag Logging Commune had either left or stayed to farm soybeans.

Meng wore a clean white tunic, slacks and loafers, with short black hair pushed neatly to the side. He looked thinner, healthier and just as earnest as before. But he was tired of retelling what became known as the “Meng Zhaoguo Incident.” Talking with him is how I imagined it would be to interview a former adult film star embarrassed about his past. “When students say they recognize me from television,” he said, “I tell them that was someone else who looks like me.”

But his notoriety had landed this job.

“A friend told me about it, and when I came for the interview, the boss had seen me on the news,” he said. “The college provides an apartment with heating, my wife and daughter are working on campus as well, and my son attends a good Harbin middle school. He’s studying English. Life is better for him here than in the forest.”

When he retold the tale over lunch in Harbin, only one detail had changed: “I asked the aliens if I would see my child,” he added. “They said yes. But they would not tell me where.”

“Once, humans believed that the earth was flat,” he said. “Even a decade ago, people would not believe that a cell phone could work. Humans, if we have never seen something with our own eyes, naturally doubt that it exists, or that life could be that way. I was the first to be brave enough to say: ‘I saw that.’

“But you know,” Meng said, nodding collegially. He looked directly into my glasses, which in the bright northeast sunlight reflected his own face, and concluded: “When you live up here, you see strange phenomena all the time.”",conspiracy
853,"When asked about climate change at a 2011 appearance at the National Press Club, former U.S. presidential candidate Gary Johnson gave an interesting response.

“In billions of years,” he said, “the sun is going to actually grow and encompass the Earth, right? So global warming is in our future.”

Putting aside that this is a swing and a miss at addressing the actual issue, there’s an important rhetorical gesture here. He’s suggesting that our contemporary problems are exclusively earthbound, and that if we were to look at them from a viewpoint that encompasses the cosmic, we would find them more manageable. It’s the same impulse that encourages space colonization as a response to climate change, that pushes Elon Musk to create plans to colonize Mars and that encourages some of us to consider signing up. It’s a belief that somewhere out there in the deep black is a way out of the overwhelming problems of living on Earth: If we’re beyond the point of fixing the foundation, it’s time we start thinking about running away from home.

We’re not likely to get a better articulation of that ambition and its weaknesses in the year 2016 than Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Ever since developer Infinity Ward released Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare in 2007, the franchise has been surprisingly adept at channeling cultural anxieties into its military thrillers. Modern Warfare itself was a paranoiac reflection of the post-Iraq War era, satirizing American involvement in the Middle East. Likewise, last year’s Black Ops 3 taps into the dangers of a fully mechanized military.

Is it any surprise, then, that now, as climate change pushes over its tipping point and a dangerous demagogue has now successfully claimed the White House for the next four years, that Call of Duty would go to space? In order to make military fantasy palatable in an increasingly dire cultural landscape, Infinity Ward’s impulse is the same as Johnson’s, as Musk’s: let’s get out of here.

Most of Infinite Warfare is spent in admiration of its futuristic space-faring military and of the technology of space travel in general. The first chapter opens on Earth, where the spaceships of the United Nations Space Alliance are gathered over Geneva for a celebration of Earth’s combined might. Inevitably, there’s a tragedy: It's a surprise attack at the hands of the Settlement Defense Front, a fascist regime that controls the outer rim of human colonies in the solar system. As the newly promoted commander of the UNSA Retribution, one of the fleet’s last remaining ships, you have to take the fight to deep space.

Most of the campaign is a pageant of mining colonies, space stations, and massive starships. You will fight through a shipyard built into an asteroid as it drifts terribly close to the sun. You will float in a space suit, drifting through open vacuum as you approach an enemy destroyer glittering against a backdrop of stars. Everywhere, Infinity Ward wants you to marvel at the Utopian wonder of it all. For Infinity Ward, the military has always been a sort of technology unto itself, a machine of choreographed motion and violence, beautiful in its care and efficiency. With Infinite Warfare, they’ve built a futuristic military apparatus that spans an entire solar system, and the lavish adoration expands alongside it.

The Call of Duty Infinity Ward wants you to see is an exciting escapist adventure spent admiring man’s technological prowess in claiming the cosmos as our own. The stated narrative reinforces this, telling a simple parable of leadership and sacrifice that has more in common with Independence Day than the moral ambiguity of Modern Warfare. The returning alternative modes—a co-operative experience against zombies and the everpresent competitive multiplayer—just reinforce that takeaway, focusing on individual prowess and collective victories. Though awash in a density of gory details, this is supposed to be Call of Duty at its most benign. It gestures toward the skies and wants you to find something safer, simpler, more heroic there, something that can make you forget your troubles until the credits roll or the match ends.

Holes start appearing in that narrative almost immediately. The Settlement Defense Front, designed to be unambiguous villains, come across as just real enough to be troubling. Part of it is the violence. In a game where every bloody moment is rendered as lavishly as possible, a human enemy never portrayed more deeply than Dr. Robotnik feels less like an acceptable target and more like a victim of thoughtless writing. We learn nothing about life on the outer colonies. We don’t know why they’re fighting or what their values are. The only SDF soldier we meet is an impossibly cruel admiral played by Kit Harrington, a flat villain whose role in the plot as a microcosm of his people only serves to make that perspective feel myopic.

Part of it is also the series of messages that run upon the player’s death. In the earlier Infinity Ward games, these words were always quotes from famous thinkers, politicians, and soldiers, usually critical of war. These talking heads distanced the player from the action, planting seeds for the quiet critiques that those early games delivered. Here, they’re tidbits of exposition about and quotes supposedly from the SDF, all of them horrifying. “Freedom is a fundamental Earth born flaw,” one reads. Another says that the SDF has mandatory military service beginning at age twelve. Situated in the same place where earlier games sowed doubt, these factoids begin to read less like information and more like propaganda.

Instead of escaping the increasingly dire politics of 2016—the realities of xenophobia, existential fear, and public martial brutality—Infinite Warfare instead seems to unwittingly reproduce them. The Other exists, it says, and they’re out there waiting for us unless we destroy them first. Sound familiar?

Once you see them, the holes are everywhere. They reveal a game that, far from escaping its context or shortcomings, is instead consumed by them. They’re in the gameplay, too in the way the campaign introduces creative new systems, like dazzling missions that freely flow from zero-G combat to naval battles to the series’ traditional ground engagements, and then tethers them to the standard 6-8 hour cinematic campaign that has always characterized the series. The established modes of Call of Duty are so set in stone, and so important to Activison’s pocketbooks, that a Call of Duty that actually capitalizes on its creators’ best ideas might never be made. Escape Earth? Hell, Call of Duty can’t even escape itself.

Infinite Warfare is not a bad Call of Duty. I’ve played nearly every game in the series, and as someone who sees the merits of the systems that make up the moment-to-moment experience of playing a shooter like it, I enjoyed myself, sometimes a good deal. But Infinite Warfare stalls out in the terrestrial shadow of itself and the political context it’s trying to run from. It wants to be a lot of things, but ultimately it’s a lesson: We can go as far into the cosmos as we want, but we can’t go alone. Our problems are stowed away in the cargo hold, and they're coming with us.",mainstream
9,"The oldest known animal in history has been discovered thanks to some well-preserved animal fat that’s been sitting in northwest Russia for the past 558 million years. The find expands the confirmed existence of animals by three million years.

The ancient animal is a Dickinsonia, which looks more like a creature from a sci-fi movie than something you’d expect to run into on Earth. Dickinsonia were oval-shaped creatures spread flat like pancakes that could grow up to four and a half feet long. Previously, the oldest macroscopic animal in the geological record was the mollusc-like Kimberella from 555 million years ago.

We already knew that Dickinsonia existed because of fossil imprints that show the animals’ eerily symmetrical, rib-like segments all over their bodies. Many of these fossils are found in southern Australia. But Ilya Bobrovskiy, a PhD student at Australian National University, had to travel to a cold, remote area near the White Sea to find ones that still had preserved fat.

“These fossils were located in the middle of cliffs of the White Sea that are [195 to 330 feet] high,” Bobrovskiy said in a university press release. “I had to hang over the edge of a cliff on ropes and dig out huge blocks of sandstone, throw them down, wash the sandstone and repeat this process until I found the fossils I was after.”

Before his discovery, it wasn’t clear that Dickinsonia were animals—i.e., that they belonged to Animalia, the same biological kingdom as humans. Dickinsonia are a type of Ediacaran biota, a group of organisms that emerged during the Ediacaran Period between 635 million and 541 million years ago. These organisms predated the “Cambrian explosion” of animal life over the next nine million years.

“Scientists have been fighting for more than 75 years over what Dickinsonia and other bizarre fossils of the Edi[a]caran Biota were: giant single-celled amoeba, lichen, failed experiments of evolution or the earliest animals on Earth,” said Jochen Brocks, a lead senior researcher at Australian National University, in the press release.

The Dickinsonia fossil tissue Bobrovskiy found contains cholesterol molecules; and because this type of fat is present in all animal tissues, it settles the debate. “The fossil fat now confirms Dickinsonia as the oldest known animal fossil, solving a decades-old mystery that has been the Holy Grail of palaeontology,” Brocks continued.

Bobrovskiy and Brocks’ collaborated with scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow; the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany; and the University of Bremen in Bremen, Germany. They published their results in the journal Science.

“However alien they looked,” the authors write, the discovery of large Dickinsonia animals “reveals that the appearance of the Ediacara biota in the fossil record is not an independent experiment in large body size but indeed a prelude to the Cambrian explosion of animal life.”",mainstream
422,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy said she’s done talking to “climate deniers” who don’t think human activities are causing global warming.

“If they haven’t figured out by now, what in God’s name could anyone say to them?” McCarthy said in a Facebook Live interview with Mashable Tuesday.

“I don’t check out flat Earth society and I’m not talking to climate deniers,” she said. “That’s it. Sorry, I know I’m supposed to be for everybody, but my patience has worn thin over eight years.”

McCarthy has been one of the more controversial EPA chiefs since the agency’s global warming rule, called the Clean Power Plan, was finalized under her watch. Republicans even called for her resignation in the wake of the EPA-caused Gold King Mine spill in 2015.

327,"Investor Warren Buffett would be more comfortable with fellow billionaire Michael Bloomberg winning the Democratic presidential nomination than front-runner Bernie Sanders.

“ ‘I don’t think another billionaire supporting him would be the best thing to announce. But sure, I would…have no trouble voting for Mike Bloomberg’ ”

That is Buffett in an interview with CNBC on Monday morning when the Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, BRK.B, chairman and chief executive, was pressed on a Democratic presidential race that’s seen Sanders, a Vermont socialist, take an early lead in the race to the nomination.

Unlike Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs chief who has engaged in a bitter war of words with Sanders to the senator’s apparent delight, Buffett said Sanders has raised some valid issues.

Keywords: Ex-Goldman boss Lloyd Blankfein ‘might find it harder to vote for Bernie’ than for Trump

“I would say this in terms of Sanders, I actually agree with him in terms of certain things he would like to accomplish. I don’t agree with him in many ways. But in terms of the fact that we ought to do better by the people that get left behind by our capitalist system. I don’t think we should kill the capitalist system in the process,” Buffett said.

Buffett, who backed Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy in 2016, said he wouldn’t attempt to handicap the race for the nomination, but said that “if given a choice, I would certainly vote for Mike Bloomberg as opposed to Sanders.”

Stocks were down sharply on Monday as worries about the spread of COVID-19 outside China sparked a global equity rout. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, was down more than 1,000 points in afternoon trade. The blue-chip gauge and the S&P 500 SPX, were both off more than 3% on the day.

Buffett said he wouldn’t cast a vote based on how he would expect the market to react to a particular candidate.

He said that an outcome that produced a Sanders presidency accompanied by a Democratic-controlled House and Senate would be significantly different from a scenario with President Donald Trump winning re-election with a Republican House and Senate.

“But I don’t think I would necessarily vote on what — in fact, I know I wouldn’t vote on what I thought necessarily would affect the market the better,” he said. “I think it’s a very poor yardstick. I would not want to cast my vote in a presidential election based on which would be better for the market in the next 30, or 60, or 90 days after the election.”

Still, Buffett, whose father was a four-term Republican congressman, said that while usually votes Democratic, it hasn’t always been a lock in the past.

“Well I think I’m going to wait and see who gets the nomination,” he said. “I’m a Democrat, but I’m not a card-carrying Democrat.”",mainstream
1245,"It's something we kind of take for granted. Roses are red, and planets are spherical. That's just the way things are, right? After all, building model solar systems would be way more challenging if, instead of using little foam balls, we had to make a bunch of icosahedron-shaped planet models.

But have you ever wondered why the planets look like this? Why are they basically spherical and not, say, cylindrical or cube-shaped?

We should kick off this discussion by calling a spade a spade. None of the planets in our solar system are perfect spheres, nor for that matter is our sun. All those bodies could more accurately be described as ""oblate spheroids."" Objects with this shape bulge slightly around the middle. To borrow an analogy from the astronomer Phil Plait, they look like a basketball that someone is sitting on.

Put more technically, in a celestial body with an oblate spheroid shape, the polar circumference will be smaller than the equatorial one. So here on Earth, if you were to travel from the North Pole to the South Pole and back, you'd have walked a grand total of 24,812 miles (39,931 kilometers). On the other hand, a complete trip around the equator would be a bit longer. That's because the circumference of Earth's equator is 24,900 miles (40,070 kilometers). As such, when you stand at sea level on the equator, you're farther away from the center of our planet than you would be at either pole.

On some other planets, this bulge is even more pronounced. Just look at Jupiter. Earth is only 0.3 percent wider at the equator than it is from pole to pole. But Jupiter's measurements showcase a much bigger disparity. Indeed, astronomers have found that this plus-sized planet is a full 7 percent wider at its equator than it is between the poles.

The oblate spheroid shape is the result of two main factors: gravity and rotation. Troy Carpenter, director of Washington State's Goldendale Observatory, recently discussed the matter with us in an email exchange. ""Everything which has mass experiences gravity, and gravity attempts to crush an object inward in all directions,"" Carpenter explains.

That's because all objects experience self-gravity, a force which pulls their atoms toward a common center. As the mass of an object increases, so too does its self-gravitational pull. After it exceeds a certain mass, the pull gets overpowering to the point where the object collapses onto itself and becomes spherical. Little items — like, say, a banana or a lug wrench — can resist this fate because their self-gravity is relatively weak, allowing them to retain non-spheroid shapes. However, in planets, suns and other truly massive bodies, the force is so strong that they can't avoid being distorted into spheroids.

""But gravity is not the whole story,"" says Carpenter. While gravity conspires to render the planets spherical, the speed of their rotations is simultaneously trying to flatten them. The faster a celestial body spins, the more disproportionate its equatorial bulge gets. ""This is why there are no perfect spheres in our solar system ... only oblate spheroids,"" Carpenter tells us. ""The sun is almost a perfect sphere, due to its immense gravity and relatively slow rotation rate of 25 days. A significant percentage of stars in the sky rotate much faster and bulge noticeably at their equators.""

One such star is Altair. Located just 16.8 light-years away from our home planet, it's among the brightest objects in the night sky. Altair is also notable for spinning very, very rapidly and completes a full rotation on its axis every 10.4 earth hours. Accordingly, astronomers estimate that Altair is at least 14 percent wider at the equator than it is from pole to pole. Rotational speed also explains Jupiter's bulge. After all, a day on this gas giant is a brisk 9.9 earth hours long.

Other forces act upon the stars and planets as well, altering their shapes. Although Earth is an oblate spheroid, it certainly isn't a perfect one. The gravitational pull of the sun and moon both influence the planet's shape to a degree. For that matter, so do Earth's own plate tectonics. Consequently, the mass of our home world isn't evenly distributed — in fact, it's rather lumpy.

Still, it looks a good deal rounder than Jupiter (and Saturn). In turn, the planets in our universe appear way more spherical than some of their moons do. Mars, for instance, has two small satellites, neither of which has the self-gravity to be pulled into an oblate spheroid. Instead, their appearance is often described as potato-shaped.

In conclusion, we'll say this much for our home planet: It may not be flawless, but at least the place is fairly well-rounded.",mainstream
200,"After blasting through the Martian atmosphere in a flying saucer-shaped craft, descending by parachute and then slowing down under the power of a thunderous rocket pack, the invader from Earth touched down on the flat Aeolis Palus, inside Gale Crater, blasting dust and rock high into the air. To any hypothetical Martians witnessing this event, the nuclear powered vehicle that emerged from the cloud of rust-coloured dust would have looked more like the first battle tank of an invasion fleet than a robotic emissary representing the human race in the name of science.

But after this dramatic entry, the robot just sat there, on its six wheels, doing nothing. For days, the robot remained stationary. Occasionally, our hypothetical Martians would have seen the alien robot swivel its ""head"" and, eventually, wiggle its wheels. By that point it was likely the Martians would have come out of hiding to examine the hulk of metal - ""if this is an invasion from the Blue Planet, those humans are idiots!"" they might have surmised.

But then, unbeknownst to the Martian bystanders, a signal was being received from Earth and the robot was commanded to target a fist-sized rock on the ground. *click click click click* The startling noise was met with tiny flashes from the rock's surface and a faint wisp of vapour. The robot had fired its laser, attacking the rock, leaving a tiny burn, in what may have looked like a warning shot. The domination of Mars had begun!

This could easily pass as an opening passage from a 1950s' science fiction novel. Sending semi-autonomous robots to Mars, after all, was science fiction until a couple of decades ago. As unlikely as it may sound, NASA really did precisely land a rover the size of a small car inside a crater on a planet hundreds of millions of miles from Earth.

This rover really is armed with a laser and it really is nuclear powered. It's also going to carry out a complex suite of chemistry tests and drill into rocks and it will continue to do so for at least one whole Martian year. This sophisticated robot is a symbol of human ingenuity, a thrilling display of our thirst for knowledge and the noble pursuit of life beyond our planet.

But why is this mission so important? And why should we care? As it turns out, NASA's addiction to Mars could uncover the habitat for an extraterrestrial genesis of life and, arguably more importantly, pave the way to an interplanetary future for mankind.

On August 29, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory roved from the landing site it had been camping out at since its dramatic August 6 landing. The one-tonne, nuclear-powered rover - nicknamed Curiosity - is now making a short trek to ""Glenelg"", a location east of Curiosity's landing site. Glenelg holds the promise of some interesting geology for the laser-totting rover to check out.

Although this first drive away from the landing site is only a quarter mile, mission scientists plan on the journey taking several weeks - there will be inevitable pit-stops along the way. But this is just the first science objective of potentially years of operation - this is a trial run before Curiosity starts its long drive to the base of a mountain that could hold the answers to some of Mars' most intimate secrets.

A month after Curiosity landed on Martian dirt, things really couldn't have gone any better. We've been treated to incredible collection of photographs from a never-before seen region of Mars. The rover is carrying an array of 17 cameras, all snapping the stunning rocky vistas on the floor of Gale Crater (a plain called Aeolis Palus) - at time of writing, over 6,000 raw images have been uploaded to the JPL public access server.

During the nervous hours running up to the rover's daring entry, descent and landing (EDL), mission scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, were keen to emphasise that any interplanetary mission is risky, and as such Curiosity could suffer some setbacks. But as the first dusty image was received from Mars and the celebrations erupted, the world began to focus on what this awesome rover would do next.

One by one, sol after sol (a ""sol"" is a Martian ""day"" - precisely 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds long), each of its instruments checked out; everything was working perfectly. Curiosity was ready to explore Gale Crater and the 3-mile high mountain in the crater's centre called Aeolis Mons, nicknamed Mt Sharp by the MSL team.

But there was one, albeit small, setback. During the mission's unique sky crane maneouver, just as the rover was winched to the ground by a rocket-powered assembly, debris was kicked up from the surface and it appears that a gravelly piece of Mars rock damaged a wind sensor.

Although this was a problem, MSL scientists believe they can find a workaround using the remaining sensor to gather the meteorological data. It would appear that the material atop the Mars surface was either lighter or smaller than anticipated, causing pieces to be scattered over the rover's ""deck"". This is just the first of likely many surprises Gale Crater has in store for Curiosity.

On August 19, however, Curiosity took its revenge on the Mars rocks, shooting its laser for the first time. But this laser wasn't being used as some kind of weapon to defend against Martian hitchhikers; this is a wonderfully advanced means of remotely taking samples of Mars rock up to 7 metres from the rover.

The Chemical Camera, or ChemCam, is located atop Curiosity's mast (what looks like the rover's blocky ""head""). It is a laser-operated spectrometer that can zoom in on target rocks, zap them and then take rapid analysis of the flash of light produced by the vapourised surface of rock.

By analysing the light, the chemical composition of the Mars rock and regolith can then be determined, providing mission scientists with a wonderful insight to the geology wherever the rover travels.

The first target was a fist-sized rock called N165, dubbed ""Coronation"", that was subjected to 30 laser pulses over a 10-second period. The early spectroscopic analysis of Coronation suggests it is consistent with basalt - a form of volcanic rock found on Earth and known to be common on Mars.

Shortly after further laser shots around Curiosity's landing zone - named ""Bradbury Landing"" after famed science fiction author Ray Bradbury who died earlier this year - the rover did what it was sent to Mars to do: rove. Initially, Curiosity was commanded to take a spin around its landing zone on August 22, taking it 6 metres from where it landed. Now that the Mars rover drivers are confident with the agility of its six wheels, Curiosity has begun its quarter-mile odyssey east.

As with any expensive mission beyond Earth, landing Curiosity on Mars had to go well. If something failed during the rover's transit from Florida launch pad to Mars dirt, a billion dollar piece of equipment was at stake. More than that; an entire NASA programme could have been in jeopardy.

Despite all the huge scientific gains from exploring another world in the Solar System and despite the search for alien life or potential human habitation of the Red Planet, NASA is suffering under a stranglehold of budgetary shrinkage - the loss of Curiosity could have been the Mars Programme's death knell. But fortunately, the world was treated to a dramatic display of engineering prowess and captivating scenes from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

But there's a background of uncertainty to the excitement that consumed the month of August. When Curiosity was launched, the only other NASA mission confirmed for Mars was a satellite slated for a 2013: MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN).

Since the successful landing of Curiosity, another surface mission to Mars has been approved to be launched in 2016: the InSight lander. Although any mission to Mars should be welcomed, the approval of InSight came at the detriment to two competing Discovery-class missions: the Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) and Comet Hopper (CHopper). It was widely believed that InSight - based on the design of the solar-powered 2008 Phoenix Mars lander - had a better likelihood of success and remaining on-budget.

Some critics think that by taking the ""safe"" option (although this is a misnomer, nothing is ""safe"" in interplanetary space), NASA is missing an opportunity to do something bold and as captivating the flagship MSL mission. Although the lower budget InSight will carry out invaluable science (it will drill into the surface layers of Mars rock and monitor seismic activity), it will likely not excite public interest like Curiosity's mission. When budgets start to shrink, so does the level of willingness to ""Dare Mighty Things"" - the MSL mission motto.

There is also criticism for focusing so many assets on Mars. The two main thrusts for Mars exploration are to a) search for life (or, at least, the potential for extraterrestrial life) and, b) assembling a knowledge base for the future manned missions and potential colonisation.

It could be argued that these two incentives are short-sighted. After all, the Saturn moon Titan appears to hold the basic ingredients for life - one of the objectives for the TiME mission was to determine the chemistry of a Titan sea - so why focus on Mars?

Also, a manned mission is a long way off; reconnaissance missions are surplus to requirements; and if we could send humans to Mars sooner rather than later, we could do more science than any robotic mission anyway.

But I'd argue that Mars is of critical importance to the future of mankind. It may be toxic to human life, but it is the most ""habitable"" for a manned outpost. As Stephen Hawking would say: ""Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space."" Mars is the only other world where we can conceivably eke out an existence and learn how to evolve on interplanetary destinations. Personally, the quest for other life forms should come second to preserving our life form.

Regardless of the politics behind exploring Mars, we have the most awesome and capable robot roving across Mars right this moment. In fact, we have two generations of Mars rovers - Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity remains operational to this day, eight years after touching down in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004, three weeks after its (now deceased) twin rover Spirit.

So, as Curiosity begins its long trek to seek out potential habitats for basic Mars life and study the fascinating, layered, geology of Aeolis Mons in the centre of Gale Crater, we need to remember that whether we do it in person, or via a nuclear-powered roving emissary, Mars exploration isn't just a fanciful endeavour. To understand Mars is to envision a world that could, one day, become a second home for mankind.

1061,"A 12 year old girl killed herself the other day. Her name was Katelyn Nichole Davis and she was from Cedartown, Georgia. Let it be known, I didn’t watch the video. I’ve lost 3 friends to suicide. The closest friend of all was a hanging suicide too. I tried it myself in my teens, and obviously (and thankfully) I didn’t succeed. There’s no way I would watch the video. That video would haunt me. But, some people did. Actually, a lot of people did.

Turns out, Katelyn used the Live.me application to live-stream her suicide, and the 42-minute video details her hanging herself from a tree. For those of you who don’t want to watch the video either, you can read the transcript someone typed up:

“The first half of the video is Katelyn positioning the camera, measuring the rope she attaches to a tree and makes adjustments. During this section, the sun is shining and the ambient neighborhood noises of passing cars, birds and barking dogs can be heard in the background.

She then climbs on top of a bucket and fastens the noose around her neck. At 21:24, after taking several deep breaths and crying, Katelyn says an anguished “Goodbye” before stepping off the bucket. Now hanging by her neck, Katelyn’s arms and legs begin to jerk and kick for a short time.

For the remaining 20 minutes of the video, Katelyn’s body sways at the end of the rope as the sun goes down, as dogs bark in the background. After 10 minutes or so, you can hear Katelyn’s family calling for her and coming close to finding her on camera. The video ends as the sun disappears and Katelyn’s cell phone repeatedly rings.”

The entire video is as surreal as it is tragic.

As for why she decided to kill herself, some of her reasons can be seen by checking out her online diary and Instagram account. According to Katelyn, she was already on medication for depression, had attempted suicide before, was a cutter, and was beaten by her stepfather who she also accused of trying to rape her.

Now, I’d really like to start a discussion about this. It can be in the comments section on here or on Facebook, whatever works for you. But I’d really like to hear your thoughts on this. “The age-adjusted suicide rate in 2014, (13.0 per 100,000 population) was 24% higher than the rate in 1999 (10.5). The average annual percent increase in the age-adjusted suicide rate was about 1% per year from 1999 through 2006 but increased to 2% per year from 2006 through 2016. The percent increase in suicide rates for females was greatest for those aged 10–14″ (Source)

Katelyn had an online diary that she was writing in for the last few weeks of her life. The original diary has been removed from the Internet, but the screenshots below show each of her entries.

The diary was titled “Diary of a Broken Doll.” The “Introduction” was written on December 21, and it gives some basic details about the young girl. She states that she would have been 13 on February 20, of this year, and also briefly begins to touch on her issues with depression.

Katelyn writes that she does not like the holidays, but not because she hates “Jesus or anything.” She goes on to say that she is just not a “happy or positive person.” She also warns that if readers feel they may be “triggered” by her diary from her going“too deep,” that they should quit reading immediately.

Then she brings up the abuse she’s been dealing with.. And for that you can read on the screenshots.

Right now there are people of all ages just like Katelyn all around the country. While it is sadly too late to help Katelyn, her story can be used to help educate people on noticing the warning signs to be able to intervene and prevent tragedies such as this from occurring. Perhaps that’s partly the reason why she recorded it.. To help raise awareness about the issue. Suicide rates are getting higher every year. BUT WHY? Why are they getting younger and younger too? What is it with our society that drives so many children and young adults to take their lives before they’ve even really started living them??

For those who may be dealing with depression and having suicidal thoughts, PLEASE know that there is ALWAYS someone you can talk to.

If you or someone you know is struggling with depression and suicide, reach out to someone you know and love, or you can contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: . They can be reached 24/7 from any phone.

862,"As the fourth global-warmed hurricane in two months rips through Florida, we are reminded that George W. Bush is history's top terrorist. We know, of course, that Bush has slaughtered thousands of Iraqis, imprisoned hundreds without trial or charges, and presided over the torture and sexual abuse of many of them. He is the world's leading recruiter for hate-America terrorists the world over. Bush's preemptive militarism has paved the way for countless crusades for oil and fundamentalism in the decades to come. He overthrew the elected government of Haiti, resulting in hundreds of deaths. He tried to do the same in Venezuela. Other target nations are sure to follow. Bush is also determined to turn AIDS into a profit center for the drug companies that help fund him. His attacks on sex education, birth control and reproductive choice will kill girls and women for the decades to come, especially if he re-criminalizes abortion in a second term. As Texas's Governor Bush executed a record 150-plus people. He publically mocked at least one, Karla Faye Tucker, who had asked him to spare her. His escalated war on drugs has helped stuff 2.2 million Americans into the largest gulag in world history. Many suffer regular physical and sexual abuse. Many are also conveniently deprived of their right to vote. Bush's catastrophic ""No Child Left Behind"" program is decimating America's once-proud educational system, vastly escalating illiteracy and ignorance. He is barring thousands of students who have traditionally come here from overseas. Their disappearance will further cripple American education, as well as America's historic role in spreading democratic values to young people around the world. Bush has also decimated the Bill of Rights and basic freedoms embodied in the US Constitution, paving the way for a potential dictatorship should he get a second term. In short, he has done to America things no foreign terrorist could ever imagine. But it all pales before Bush's all-out attack on the natural environment, which will ultimately kill hundreds of millions of people. Bush's eco-terror crusade has two primary roots: corporate greed and fundamental religious extremism. On the corporate side, Bush's entire environmental policy can be summarized in a simple sentence: Any polluter favored by the Bush regime can pillage and destroy any sector of the American ecology, regardless of the consequences, with full official sanction, including huge taxpayer handouts. Bush's signature flip flop has been on global warming. The scientific and insurance community is now virtually unanimous that rising carbon dioxide levels are wrecking utter havoc with global weather patterns, including this latest parade of Caribbean hurricanes. The only dissenters are oil company flacks, flat earth think tanks and fundamentalist fanatics. Bush promised in 2000 that if elected he would endorse the Kyoto Accords to cut CO2 emissions. But then he joined Joseph Stalin in demanding that science fit his bizarre ideology. At the behest of his petro-backers, including Dick Cheney's Halliburton, Bush has scorned a global consensus that includes his primary ally in Iraq, British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Two of the world's biggest insurance companies, Swiss Re: and Munich Re:, have issued strong warnings about the skyrocketing costs of climate catastrophes. Even British Petroleum has voiced concern, at the same time making massive investments in solar power. Bush's fossil-nuke energy plan gives huge tax credits for gas guzzling HumVees, but has cynically stalemated long-standing green energy tax easements, crippling the once-booming US wind power industry. Three years after Bush allowed 9/11, America's 103 atomic power reactors remain vulnerable to attacks from the air. The first plane that flew into the World Trade Center could instead have turned the Indian Point reactors north of New York City into radioactive infernos. Such an apocalyptic attack could still happen, killing millions and costing trillions, dwarfing Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. By doing nothing significant to make US reactors safer, Bush has painted them with a big terror bullseye. Bush is also reviving nuke weapons production and testing, escalating the likelihood of nuclear war and production disasters. After 9/11, Bush lied to the people of New York about the toxic fallout from the WTC collapses. His cover-up caused countless avoidable deaths. His assaults on the air, water, food and other regulatory responsibilities daily poison millions worldwide. They feed the on-going plague of cancers, lung and heart disease, childhood afflictions and too much more to catalog here. Acid rain and ozone destruction add to the horrors of global warming, as do Bush's attacks on America's national parks and public lands. As history's most environmentally destructive human, Bush's hate-nature crusade has been blessed by fanatic fundamentalists who believe destruction of the planet will hasten the Messiah. James Watt, Ronald Reagan's Interior Secretary, scorned attempts to preserve the Earth by announcing that Jesus was coming soon anyway. Bush spinmeister Karl Rove bans such blunt talk. But his all-out attacks on environmental protection, fuel efficiency, renewable energy and much more have already guaranteed an avoidable death toll unparalleled in human history. The evil winds of climate chaos now blasting through the Caribbean may soon seem like mild breezes compared to the ultimate eco-curse of George W. Bush. Attila the Hun. Genghis Khan. The Kaiser. Hitler. Stalin. Saddam. Bin Laden. None have killed more than those dying and destined to die at Bush's anti-green hands. His terror attacks have driven Mother Earth to the very brink. Four more years and he just might finish her off---and all of us with her.",conspiracy
296,"Snowfall is crucial to Earth's life-giving water cycle, and fresh snow is a special bonus to Olympic athletes whose careers depend on sliding, gliding or jumping over it.

To provide the gold-medal hopefuls with forecasts every 6 hours and improve snow-prediction models for mountainous terrains, NASA has partnered with 20 agencies from about a dozen countries to collect weather data during the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, according to a recent statement from the space agency.

The World Wildlife Fund estimates that one out of every eight people lives in the world's mountains, and according to NASA, one in six relies on the water released by seasonal snowfall collecting in the mountains. Winter wonderlands are vital, but for many people during these next few weeks, fresh powder will feel even more important. Most nations have their eyes on the dramatic snow-capped mountains around Pyeongchang to watch their most-talented skiers and snowboarders go for gold. [In Photos: South Korea from Above]

So to compare the weather experienced in the mountains with satellite and radar predictions, an international team of researchers, which includes several NASA scientists, will predict event weather by partnering with the World Meteorological Organization's World Weather Research Programme. NASA will participate in this project, called ICE-POP (International Collaborative Experiments for Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games) until the end of the 2018 Paralympic Games, on March 18.

According to NASA, land-based radar instruments are typically placed in easily accessible areas on even land. But not all areas of Earth are easy to access; jagged, uneven terrain like that in northeast South Korea presents a challenge, and for NASA, it's an opportunity to improve prediction models. Vertical drops on the hills are common, too, and these can cause swift wind changes. Wind speed is especially important for athletes like mogul skiers, who zoom down bumpy slopes at high velocities.

Airflow, altitude and temperature can also affect the size of the snowflakes, which influences outdoor sporting conditions.

Satellites like the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission are important for water-cycle forecasts. However, it's sometimes difficult for the satellite to assess the size and shape of the snowflakes because the changes are caused by airflows that quickly change direction — a phenomenon that develops closer to the creviced surface. Rates of mountain snowfall are also challenging to predict from space because wind conditions can change quickly, and when that happens, snowflakes don't fall at the same speed. Plus, the flat structure of snowflakes makes their movements challenging to observe from space, NASA officials said.

The researchers are hoping for a few good snowstorms, according to the statement. They'll compare observations from NASA's Dual-frequency, Dual-polarized, Doppler Radar (D3R) system with those from the GPM Core Observatory satellite. By comparing the models with the observations, researchers hope to get a better prediction model of snowfall on the mountains and more clearly understand how it falls.

NASA will take observations and deliver snow forecasts from 16 points near the Olympic event venues. The NASA team will work alongside U.S. colleagues from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Center for Atmospheric Research and Colorado State University. The data is communicated to Olympic officials so that competition logistics can take the weather into account.

The GPM Core Observatory satellite is a joint mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and is designed to detect falling snow and estimate rates of rainfall from space. Every 30 minutes, GPM provides global maps of precipitation. To do so, the satellite works alongside 12 other international and U.S. spacecraft.",mainstream
523,"""They [penguins] are charismatic, endearing and in serious trouble,"" warned NBC’s Anne Thompson on the Dec. 12, 2007, ""Nightly News."" Thompson didn’t include any disagreement.

While the networks had plenty of time to worry about the future of birds, most network news shows didn’t take much time to include any other point of view even though hundreds of scientists have expressed skepticism of manmade climate change theory.

Another NBC reporter, Kerry Sanders, hyped the threat of warming to polar bears and walruses on Dec. 9, 2007, ""a world scientists say may melt away by 2050."" Sanders didn’t include any scientists who disagreed with that claim.

The lack of balance on the issue prompted one network journalist, John Stossel of ABC, to do a story on the media’s one-sidedness on “20/20” Oct. 19, 2007.

“You’ve heard the reports. The globe is warming. And it’s our fault. And the consequences will be terrible. But you should know there is another side to this story,” teased Stossel as he began his “Give me a Break” segment.

There is another side to the issue. In one story, Stossel interviewed four scientists critical of the so-called “consensus” on global warming. That’s four more dissenting scientists than CBS put on its network in six entire months.

To better assess network behavior on this key topic, the Business & Media Institute examined 205 stories from ABC, CBS and NBC that mentioned ""global warming"" or ""climate change"" between July 1, 2007, and Dec. 31, 2007.

BMI found skepticism was shut out of a vast majority of reports. Overall, a measly 20 percent had any dissent at all referenced by a journalist or guest.

Skeptical voices were suppressed by the networks, outnumbered by nearly a 7-to-1 ratio by those promoting fear of climate change or being used by the network for the same purpose. CBS had an even worse record: nearly 38 proponents to one skeptic.

Lengthy segments like Scott Pelley’s Oct. 21, 2007, ""60 Minutes"" story on ""The Age of Megafires"" certainly had time to include an alternative point of view to the notion that global warming is largely responsible for bigger, hotter fires in the American West. But Pelley skipped those voices – voices like a University of California Merced professor published on the Washington Spokesman-Review Web site about the California wildfires.

According to Alan Zarembo’s Oct. 24, 2007, story, “Scientists said it would be difficult to make that case, given the combustible mix of drought and wind that has plagued the region for centuries or more.”

Anthony Westerling, a UC-Merced professor and climate scientist, told Zarembo that the wildfires were the result of two “staples of the region’s climatic history,” meaning “strong Santa Ana winds” and “a drought that turned much of the hillsides to bone-dry kindling.”

""Neither can be attributed to climate change,"" said Westerling.

The near blackout of skepticism on the networks didn’t come as much of a surprise, since reporters like Pelley have been much more than onlookers in the story of global warming. In many cases they have become advocates – even going “to the ends of the earth” “to find evidence of climate change.”

Ann Curry of NBC’s “Today” made that clear on Oct. 29, 2007: “[O]ur mission, of course, is to find evidence of climate change.”

When people with other views were mentioned, it sometimes came with a denigrating label like “deniers” or “cynics.” Such critics were also portrayed as flat-earthers by journalists and guests. One person skeptical of manmade climate change, a Kentucky state representative, managed to get on the air but was treated to an exceptionally hostile interview by ABC’s Bill Weir.

There were many other flaws in the reporting that created a very one-sided perspective. Journalists repeatedly phrased questions or made statements indicating human-caused warming was a fact, and they included opinions of politicians, movie stars, musicians and ordinary people like bankers instead of relying on scientists.

But according to Dr. Pat Michaels viewers would be better served by hearing both sides. “They would benefit from appreciating the true scientific diversity on the topic. The arguments against these gloom and doom global warming scenarios are much stronger than the arguments for them,” Michaels told BMI.

According to NBC’s Brian Williams, “There’s no shortage of folks out there saying it’s [global warming is] not all that bad.” Williams was teasing a “Nightly News” story on August 15 that included two other voices: Dr. Pat Michaels, a research professor of environmental sciences, and Marlo Lewis, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

Williams was certainly right – there are hundreds of scientists from around the world who question the global warming “consensus” – but in the news the latter half of 2007 you had to look hard to find them.

On the three networks, 80 percent of stories (167 out of 205) didn’t mention skepticism or anyone at all who dissented from global warming alarmism. CBS did the absolute worst job. Ninety-seven percent of its stories (34 out of 35) ignored other opinions. Williams’ own network, NBC, came in a close second with 85 percent (76 out of 89) excluding skepticism. ABC was the most balanced network, but still censored dissent from 64 percent of its stories (34 out of 53).

But dissent flourishes. The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee released a list on Dec. 20, 2007, of more than 400 skeptical scientists from different fields – astrophysics, geology, climatology, meteorology and others. The release didn’t even earn a news brief from one of the three networks as of Dec. 31, 2007.

Even when one show claimed it would represent a range of opinions on the issue, it didn’t. On Oct. 30, 2007, NBC “Today” co-host Matt Lauer teased the upcoming “Ends of the Earth” broadcasts saying to Meredith Vieira, “And you’re going to be interviewing all the experts talking about the issues of climate change.” (emphasis added)

Vieira replied, “Absolutely. Getting into a whole debate, too, because some people believe there’s an effect of climate change, others say not really. So we’re going to discuss all of it and give viewers at home real tips on what you can do.”

But on Nov. 5 and 6, 2007 as “Today” went to the “Ends of the Earth,” the only “experts” Vieira spoke to were former vice president Al Gore, Chip Giller of Grist.org – a left-wing environmental Web site – and Katherine Wroth, co-author of “Wake Up and Smell the Planet.”

Grist is an extreme publication. David Roberts of the environmentalist magazine called for ""war crimes trials for these bastards ¬– some sort of climate Nuremberg,"" referring to the climate change ""denial industry."" (Roberts later retracted his comment, but not until it received a strongly negative response.)

The only skepticism of global warming “consensus” that came up was a brief mention by Vieira as she interviewed Gore. She asked Gore about John Christy, one scientist formerly with the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), who criticized Gore’s predictions in an op-ed printed in The Wall Street Journal. Gore shot back calling Christy an “outlier.”

Vieira didn’t question Gore’s remark or give Christy an opportunity to respond to the attack. Perhaps if she had, Christy would have echoed his remarks from the Nov. 1, 2007, Wall Street Journal:

“I see neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see. Rather, I see a reliance on climate models (useful but never ‘proof’) and the coincidence that change in carbon dioxide and global temperatures have loose similarity over time,” said Christy.

He continued, “We [dissenting scientists] discount the possibility that everything is caused by human actions, because everything we’ve seen the climate do has happened before. Sea levels rise and fall continually. The Arctic ice cap has shrunk before. One millennium there are hippos swimming in the Thames, and a geological blink later there is an ice bridge linking Asia and North America.”

Journalists practically drooled over Al Gore during Live Earth interviews and after he won the Nobel Peace Prize. In contrast, people with alternative views barely got face time on the networks. Instead, they received insults and hostile questions.

The ugliest treatment of a skeptic was by Bill Weir on Nov. 18, 2007, “Good Morning America.” He was interviewing Democratic state representative Bill Gooch from Kentucky.

Weir peppered Gooch with hardball questions and even attacked Gooch’s motives:

Gooch made it clear that he supported an open debate, saying, “[T]here is another side of the story. I think what we have is we have the problem of global warming about to become a political problem when lawmakers in Congress, when governors in states, when even the courts start to act in ways that are gonna affect the American people in severe ways.” Gooch then mentioned the possible $6-trillion cost of one bill to deal with global warming.

“And what I wanna make sure that we do is that if we act, we have the science right,” explained Gooch.

Weir wasn’t satisfied: “But, but according to all these scientists, the more handwringing we do, the more we dither on this, the worse it’s going to get. And what if you’re wrong? What if this is, in fact, a global catastrophe? Isn’t it a moral imperative as a public servant to err on the side of planetary survival and get something done?”

Instead of letting Gooch debate with someone who disagreed, Weir filled that role himself. He came across as a passionate advocate for “something” that would supposedly aid “survival,” ignoring the cost, accuracy, and his supposed objectivity.

Journalists also called skeptics “deniers,” conjuring images of Holocaust deniers, and cast them as flat-earthers – ironically forgetting that there was once a scientific consensus that the earth was flat.

When Gore attacked Dr. Christy [who was mentioned by Meredith Vieira] on “Today” Nov. 5, 2007, Gore specifically compared people critical of anthropogenic (human-caused) global warming to people who think the Earth is flat.

“Well, he’s an outlier, he no longer belongs to the IPCC. And he is way outside the scientific consensus … There are still people who believe that the Earth is flat,” said Gore.

Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger made the same disparaging comparison on July 16, 2007 “Early Show” on CBS. After co-host Harry Smith said, “[I] asked why some people still don’t believe we have a problem.”

“Well, I think that there is [sic] still a lot of people that still think that the world is flat,” said Schwarzenegger.

NBC’s chief environmental affairs correspondent Anne Thompson said, ""He is proudly a denier,"" of research professor and CATO senior fellow Dr. Pat Michaels.

Michaels told BMI, “She has no idea what she’s talking about. I have written and spoken repeatedly in the last 15 years that human beings are responsible for most of the warming in the past century.” What Michaels disagrees on is whether such warming will result in environmental catastrophe.

Recalling that NBC interview, Michaels continued, “The interview was great, but she pulled out one little piece and took it completely out of context. It was really, really disappointing. The interview was conducted in a very professional fashion, it was the editing that clearly did not reflect the tone and content of the overall interview.”

Thompson actually included two dissenting views in that Aug. 15, 2007, “Nightly News” but undermined both their opinions by implying they were not experts and were only making trouble: “Climate experts say whether hired guns or honest dissenters, deniers are confusing the issue and delaying solutions.”

A paltry 37 people expressing skepticism were included in six months of TV news coverage on the issue across three networks. That included all kinds of people like politicians or government employees, business representatives, celebrities, ordinary people and unidentified people. Only seven of them were scientists like Michaels.

CBS practically banned skeptics from its network, including only four and not a single scientist. The network seemed to adopt the mentality of CBS journalist Scott Pelley, who referred to global warming skeptics as “deniers” in March 2006 when he said, “If I do an interview with [Holocaust survivor] Elie Wiesel, am I required as a journalist to find a Holocaust denier?” Recent “60 Minutes” segments from Pelley indicated he hasn’t changed his mind about balanced journalism.

Those skeptical of the environmental impact of Gore’s Live Earth concerts on July 7, 2007 also earned scorn from the media – even those like Bob Geldof who weren’t questioning the science.

“[T]here have been cynics out there who question whether the artists are practicing what they preach,” said NBC’s Lester Holt on July 7, 2007 “Today.”

ABC’s Bill Weir claimed that “all the scientists” urge immediate action to stop global warming, but it wasn’t just scientists the three networks relied on to make that case. Far from it.

There were politicians and government workers. Musicians like Madonna and Dave Matthews. Movie star Leonardo DiCaprio. And quite possibly, your next-door neighbor.

What those celebrities said had little to do with science and everything to do with advocacy. Singer KT Tunstall, a Live Earth performer, was quoted by ABC on July 7, 2007.

“I think I am an environmentalist. I mean, I don’t have a car. I live in a small apartment,” said Tunstall.

Madonna urged Live Earth attendees, ""If you wanna save the planet, let me see you jumping up and down.""

But it wasn’t just globe-trotting stars telling people the planet was in danger and crowding out any other perspective.

Politicians offered perhaps more substance, but certainly not much more science than the Hollywood types. In addition to fawning over Gore, networks interviewed Florida Gov. Charlie Crist (R), California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (Independent), among others.

Reporters also relied on ordinary voices to reinforce the idea that global warming was already a major threat impacting our daily lives.

Only 15 percent of the people used to support global warming positions were scientists – identified as a ""scientist"" or with a specialty like genetics, ecology, biology or oceanography. A total of 71 scientists were included in six months of coverage. But networks turned to ordinary, unidentified people nearly a third more often than the scientists (101 to 71.)

Networks turned to ordinary people like two Live Earth concertgoers and the unidentified female “consumer” quoted by ABC “World News with Charles Gibson” on Sept. 14, 2007.

“You know, I think everybody’s got to think about it. We’ve got to change,” said a woman in a story about carbon labeling of food products.

Those quotes were used to underline the points that reporters made. One story on “Today” Nov. 6, 2007, warned that melting ice could kill off polar bears. Reporter Kerry Sanders included three unidentified people talking about polar bears – supporting his remark that “Worst-case scenario: If the Arctic ice continues to melt, in the next 100 years, the U.S. Wildlife Service says the only place you’ll find a polar bear will be at the zoo.”

Worries over Arctic melt flooded global warming coverage in the latter half of 2007, but as columnist John Tierney wrote in the Jan. 1, 2008 New York Times: “When the Arctic sea ice last year [2007] hit the lowest level ever recorded by satellites, it was big news and heralded as a sign that the whole planet was warming. When the Antarctic sea ice last year reached the highest level ever recorded by satellites, it was pretty much ignored.”

No Need for Debate, Warming is ‘Fact’



To many in the news media, global warming and its reported cause were already established fact. It was clear by the way some journalists talked about warming that they had accepted Gore’s insistence that “the debate’s over.”

Just listen to CBS’s Harry Smith: “Before we do anything else, there is, in fact, global climate change. It really affects some climates much more than others and it’s really caused some real serious problems.” Those serious problems Smith was talking about were allergies during a segment on the Aug. 7, 2007 “Early Show.”

ABC’s Sam Champion seemed to agree. Champion called the fourth U.N. IPCC report “definitive” on Sept. 5, 2007 and said he had been “investigating the alarming numbers of animals that are disappearing due to global warming” in July.

But Dan Harris went the farthest on Dec. 2, 2007 in a story about security risk and global warming. The “World News Sunday” host told viewers to “Think about this scenario: global warming contributes to a severe drought and food shortage in a third-world country. The government collapses. Warlords take over. America is forced to intervene.”

Shockingly, Harris then claimed: “It’s already happened, Somalia, 1993, with disastrous consequences.”

Harris excluded expertise on the Somali situation or any context. Human Rights Watch, a liberal international organization, gave a very different perspective at the time of the crisis back in 1992:

“Somalia has historically been subject to famines, especially in the pastoral areas of the center and north … The current famine that threatens Mogadishu and south-central Somalia is radically different in origin and impact. Drought has played only a minor role, and the main victims are poor townspeople, farmers and rural laborers.”

The ABC correspondent didn’t include any statements about the way the war was thought to have contributed to the famine.

Journalists weren’t the only ones claiming that global warming was a fact, though. But the people journalists chose to interview also included Gore saying the “debate’s over” and didn’t dispute Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s incorrect statement that there was “zero dissent” on the issue, or Leonardo DiCaprio’s assertion of a “90-percent consensus.”

“Consensus” was rarely questioned by reporters at all, and ABC’s Bill Weir even used the concept of “these 4,000 or so scientists” to hammer at one person expressing a different view.

The media did a terrible job of actually explaining what the IPCC was. Atmospheric scientist Dr. John Christy told Earth & Sky Web site that the “IPCC would do well to define what each participant truly contributes to each product (i.e. Summary for Policy Makers vs. Full Text) so that the world would know that thousands of scientists never reached a ‘consensus’ on anything.”

“When the Full Text is developed, ‘consensus’ is a concept held by the chapters’ Lead Authors who often ignore or contradict positions offered by the Contributing Authors and Reviewers,” explained Christy.

David Henderson, a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), wrote a detailed criticism of the IPCC in the Oct. 11, 2007 Wall Street Journal. He called the process “flawed” and biased because “the Panel members and those who appoint them are of course identified with the policies of their governments And virtually all governments are formally committed … to the ‘stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere’.”

“[T]his puts in doubt the accepted basis of official climate policies,” concluded Henderson.

It Don’t Cost a Thing if It’s Got That Climate Swing



Not only did the networks censor skepticism from stories, but the cost of proposed solutions, small or large, was routinely omitted.

BMI found that 90 percent of the stories didn’t mention cost at all, even though the networks urged immediate action to stop the “climate crisis.”

“NBC Nightly News” ignored cost in a Dec. 18, 2007 report about the recent energy bill passed by Congress.

“What America drives could change dramatically under the energy bill,” said Anne Thompson before quoting David Hamilton of the left-wing environmentalist group Sierra Club.

Hamilton lauded parts of the bill during the “Fueling Change” segment: “This bill means that we will get all the same safety, all the same performance that we’ve ever gotten from our cars, but we’ll get it with more miles to the gallon.”

Thompson and Hamilton both ignored the obvious cost to auto manufacturers of designing vehicles that will be able to meet the new fuel efficiency requirements. Likely, those costs will be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher vehicles prices.

Other plans to curb greenhouse-gas emissions could cost trillions of dollars. One estimate by business consulting firm CRA International put a $4-trillion to $6-trillion price tag on the Lieberman-Warner bill, which would mandate scaling back emissions levels to 1990s levels by 2020. That would cost each American man, woman and child $494 a year.

Network reporters also didn’t focus on how much is already being spent. As the Business & Media Institute reported in its “Fire and Ice” study, more than 99.5 percent of American climate change funding comes from the government – taxpayers – and we spend $4 billion per year on climate change research.

The Kyoto treaty that was never ratified by the U.S. carried an estimated cost of $440 billion per year for America. The Senate voted 95 to 0 to reject it.

BMI examined all ABC, CBS and NBC news transcripts that included the terms “global warming” or “climate change” during the most recent six month period – from July 1, 2007, to Dec. 31, 2007. Only stories mentioning those terms were included in the study.

The stories were split into two categories: stories and casual mentions. Casual mentions encompassed anchor briefs shorter than 50 words and longer stories that only mentioned global warming or climate change incidentally (the story was not about that issue).

“Dissent,” for the purpose of this study, included any uncertainty [""I don’t know""], alternative opinions about warming, and caution against making climate change policy decisions without more information. It also included criticism of “solutions” to global warming and “awareness” campaigns like Live Earth ¬– even when the critic wasn’t disagreeing with manmade climate change, but just the usefulness of worldwide rock concerts.

People quoted in a story that supported climate change claims were placed in the proponent category because their comments were used by the network to support the manmade global warming viewpoint. There was one exception. In one story, scientist Bill Nye presented both positions on the issue in a balanced manner. He was counted as neutral in that story.

841,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Feb 13 (Reuters) - NASA intends to cancel plans to join Europe on a Mars sampling mission that is considered important to learning if life appeared beyond Earth as the U.S. space agency balances out a virtually flat $17.7 billion budget for 2013, officials said on Monday.

NASA’s proposal leaves Europe without a key partner for a proposed two-spacecraft mission to collect and return soil samples from Mars. The so-called Exobiology on Mars, or ExoMars, probes are targeted to launch in 2016 and 2018.

The United States wants to recast its Mars exploration program to include both science and human exploration goals, NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden said at a news conference to unveil the agency’s proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The agency’s current budget is $17.8 billion.

“Despite a constrained fiscal environment, this budget continues to aggressively implement the space exploration program agreed to by the president and a bipartisan majority in Congress,” Bolden said. “The time for debate about our future is over. We have a solid plan.”

“The Holy Grail of Mars exploration is sample return,” NASA’s associate administrator, John Grunsfeld, told reporters on a conference call. “Those (ExoMars) missions on our current budget trajectory were not executable.”

Instead, the agency wants to combine elements of its human space program with technology demonstrations and space science for an alternative Mars mission, such as an advanced communications satellite, that could launch in 2018 or 2020. Earth and Mars favorably align for launches every 18 months.

Overall, the Obama administration wants to spend $4.9 billion on space science, including $1.2 billion for planetary missions, $628 million on the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope - the delayed and over-budget James Webb Space Telescope - and $1.8 billion on Earth science projects.

Most of NASA’s proposed budget remains focused on human space programs, with $3 billion to support International Space Station research, maintenance and staffing, and $3.9 billion to design a capsule and rocket that can fly astronauts to the moon, asteroids, Mars and other destinations beyond the station’s 240-mile (385-km) orbit.

The budget includes a final $70.6 million to close out the space shuttle program and transfer the three retired orbiters to museums. The aging shuttles were retired last year.

It also includes $830 million to spur development of privately owned space taxis to ferry astronauts to the space station, a $100 billion laboratory owned by the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada.

The new spending plan includes $99 million that could be spent to speed up space taxi development or to buy more seats aboard Russian Soyuz capsules, which are currently the only vehicles flying crew to the space station. NASA pays Russia about $60 million per person for rides.

The budget also includes $699 million for space technology research and development; $552 million for aeronautics; $619 million for construction, including development of a multi-use launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center; $100 million for education; and $2.8 billion for support of the agency’s 10 centers.

For the fiscal 2012 year that ends on Sept. 30, NASA intends to spend $3 billion on overhead, including administrative travel and information technology.

The plan drew immediate fire from the non-profit Planetary Society, a space science advocacy group.

“The priorities reflected in this budget would take us down the wrong path,” Planetary Society chief Bill Nye said in a statement.

“Science is the part of NASA that’s actually conducting interesting and scientifically important missions. The country needs more of these robotic space exploration missions, not less,” Nye said. (Editing by Jane Sutton)",mainstream
638,"Most of the recent news about Google (GOOG) has been bad. Online advertising posted a slow fourth quarter. That unexpectedly included both display ads and search marketing which has made Google one of the fastest growing large companies in America. Several Wall St. analysts have commented that Google's search revenue's rate of increase flattened out in January and February. Since the consensus among experts who cover the company is that revenue will rise 11% in the first quarter, a flat quarter would be devastating.

One of the things that Wall St. hates about Google is that it does one thing better than any other company in the world, but that is all it does. Google Chrome browser, Google Earth, Google Maps, and YouTube have really made much money. Some of the features have not produced any revenue at all. If its search operation falters, Google's run as the hottest tech company in the world could be over. (See pictures of Google Earth.)

At this point, Google is a $22 billion company. If the search business drops to a growth rate of 10% a year, it will take three years for Google's sales to get to $30 billion. From the time Microsoft (MSFT) hit $22 billion in sales in 2000, it took the company less than three years to get to the $30 billion plateau. Then from 2002 to 2008, Microsoft's sales doubled. The software business not only grew. Until recently, it grew quickly. (See pictures of Bill Gates.)

The assumption about Google's prospects is that the search company is the next Microsoft. Twenty years ago, Microsoft had the hot hand. Sales of Windows and the company's business and server software were stunning. The margins on some of Microsoft's software franchises were over 70%. Then the hyper-growth stopped as the company's market penetration of PCs and servers reached a saturation point. Microsoft's stock never saw the level it hit in 2000 again. Without lucrative stock options, employees who wanted to make it rich moved to start-ups. The people who had been at the company thirty years were already rich. Many of them retired.

About seven years after Microsoft's stock hit an all-time high, Google traded at $747, its peak. It now changes hands at $348, and if the company's sales can only grow at 10% or 15%, the stock is not going back above $700, ever. The myth about companies like Microsoft and Google is that what they do is so important to business and consumers and so pervasive that the growth curve never flattens out. It does flatten at every company. No exceptions.

The press coverage of Google this week included a few pathetic announcements. Disney (DIS) will put some of its premium content on Google's YouTube. That should be good for $10 million in revenue a year. Google is starting a $100 million venture capital arm which will make it the 1,000th largest venture operation in the world. In other words, it will not be managing enough venture money to matter. Then word came out that Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) might use Google's operating system in some of its netbooks instead of Microsoft Windows. The important word in that report is ""might."" The news that Google is adding thousands of employees a quarter and that the founders have bought a 747 or an aircraft carrier probably hit a high point two years ago.

Saying that Google is doing poorly is not the same as saying that Microsoft is doing well. What matters to Microsoft is that Google becomes less of a threat each day as it fails in its diversification attempts. Google's cash flow does not continue to give it an almost limitless capital arsenal. Google has to consider cutting people in areas which will never be profitable. The entire ethos at Google is in the process of changing. Microsoft may be in third place in the search business, but it is in first place in software, which is still the larger industry.

Investors still ask Microsoft why it is in the video game business. There is not any reasonable answer. It is an awful business with poor margins. It has nothing to do with selling Windows. There may have been some idea that being in the hardware business would help the software business, but, if so, that idea didn't work out a long time ago.

With the perceived playing field that Microsoft and Google operate on a bit more level now, they can race after the one market that could be substantial for either one or both of them, which is providing software and search on mobile devices. The smartphone, which is really a PC for the pocket, is part of the one-billion-units-per-year-in-sales handset industry. Providing the operating software and other key components for wireless devices is almost certainly the next big thing for tech companies from Google to Yahoo (YHOO) to Microsoft to Adobe (ADBE). Trying to milk more money out of the PC gets harder and harder. For the largest companies in the industry, it has become a zero sum game. (See pictures of the 50 best websites of 2008.)

For Google and Microsoft, the best days are over, unless one can dominate the handset world the way it did the universe of computers.

437,"We figure you’re probably a bit worn out, news-wise. So the only stunner we have to report is that the Ninety Niners Discount Market in West L.A. is holding a going-out-of-business sale at which “all 99 cents items are 89 cents.”

WHAT ON EARTH?It has withstood the taunts of the scientific community, but the Lancaster-based headquarters of the Flat Earth Society was recently destroyed by a more elemental force--fire.

And founder Charles Johnson, who lost all his membership records, is hoping to hear from the 23-year-old group’s 3,500 subscribers so he can put together a new list.

“The BBC called me from England, so word will get out there,” Johnson said. “And I just got a call from a couple in Holland. Funny thing is, I also heard from a former captain at Edwards Air Force Base. He’d lost his membership certificate when he moved.”

The fire also wiped out Johnson’s back copies of the Flat Earth News, published four times a year ($25 for new members, $15 for renewals), as well as his copies of the Flat Earth Map (rectangular-shaped, of course).

Johnson, who believes the space missions have all been faked, says the question he is asked most often is: If the world’s flat, how come no one has fallen off the edge? His response: “No one has reached the edge.” He refuses to believe there are other planets and, as for the lights that are twinkling in the skies, he says: “Who knows what they are?”

The destruction of his records was a disaster, but things could be worse. At least his headquarters wasn’t hit by a meteor.

YOU GOTTA BELIEVE: David Croonquist of Lancaster found a church on wheels that performs good works--even if a cynic could read the message on its van the wrong way (see photo).

BASEMENT OF FAME: But enough about Lancaster, Calif. Let’s move on to Lancaster, N.H., where townsfolk are collecting cement impressions of famous visitors for their own planned Walk of Fame.

This comes at a vulnerable time for Hollywood, which had to put many of its plaques in storage during the Metro Rail subway construction. The Fargo, N.D., Walk of Fame and the Chula Vista, Calif., Walk of Fame, among others, have since held several inductions, though neither has tried to seize the title of Entertainment Capital.

“My first thought was, ‘Who famous comes to Lancaster?’ ” said a modest Lawrence (Gomer) Powell, the town’s water department superintendent. He is in charge of the plaques stored in the Town Hall basement.

Lancaster’s inductees include author Ernest Hebert, filmmaker Jay Craven and former Olympic skier Penny Pitou--none of whom are on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Well, we have to end this part of the column here.

Sorry, but we couldn’t think of any more Lancaster items.

The Vatican Library Collection of costume jewelry, designed by the 1928 Jewelry Co. of Burbank, is being introduced in department stores around the country this week in connection with the visit of Pope John Paul II.

647,"Celtics Coach Brad Stevens walked briskly into the postgame news conference not inclined to mince words. “They are one hell of a basketball team,” he said. “They are better than we are. And they earned it, and it was clear.”

Stevens spoke as coaches do of seeking answers in video of games, but his urgent need was for a team therapist. The Celtics were rent by odd jealousies all season and gears that ground and locked up. The flat-earth scholar and point guard Kyrie Irving was not the least of the team’s problems. He fancied himself a leader and yet spent the season sniping at the young players he purported to lead.

In Cleveland, he had chafed at playing Robin to James’s Batman.

But after shooting 21 for 65 in the last three games of this series, he would best conceive of his summer free-agent hunt as a protégé in search again of a true leader. He walked into the postgame conference in a metaphorically appropriate manner, which was to say, alone.

“It’s a basketball journey,” he told the press. “They put a stop to that.”

That they did. Now as the Bucks prepare for the Eastern Conference finals, the Western Conference teams might consider what is steaming down the tracks. Antetokounmpo, who was born and raised in Athens and goes by the politically incorrect name Greek Freak, was clever in ways that were supposed to elude 24-year-olds. On Wednesday night, his shot was off, the defense collapsed on him and his finger rolls weren’t rolling, and yet he finished with 20 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists.

When statements were required early in the game, he had a release ready to go. In the first quarter, with the Celtics not yet on the D.O.A. gurney, their center, Al Horford, got the ball underneath the basket. He faked and spun a shot toward the rim.",mainstream

1179,"The US and Canada are not supporting “the return of democracy” in Venezuela as they claim. Instead, they are following in their shameful histories of colonialism, imperialism, exploitation, illegal wars of aggression, and overthrowing governments. They are crushing democracy in Venezuela by exploiting class and race warfare, being carried out by an elite white-supremacist minority against the poor, Afro-Indigenous, and other Venezuelans of color.



A white-minority has dominated commerce and politics in Venezuela since the days of slavery in the 19th century. Venezuela had slavery, just as did the rest of the Caribbean and Latin America. Slavery went back to the early 16th century Spanish conquistadors. More abducted Africans were trafficked to the Caribbean and Latin America, than to the USA.

Slavery was officially abolished in all of the Americas in the 19th century. The history of slavery in the Caribbean and Latin America has left a legacy of prejudice, discrimination and class conflict, which has largely gone unresolved.

Different skin complexions of Latin Americans are due mostly to various mixtures of European, Spanish and Indigenous bloodlines. The darker the skin color, along with other ethnic features, the more there is of discrimination in education, employment, and opportunity. Discrimination against blacks and people of color perpetuates poverty and class conflict. In Venezuela, as elsewhere in the Caribbean and Latin America, political power, commerce and wealth is largely in the hands of a minority of upper-class elites, whom are mostly whiter and lighter than those with darker skin complexion.

One can get a sense of how much class and race affect Latin American society by watching Spanish language movies and soap operas. Here are just two examples below: the setting for the TV series “The White Slave” is 19th century Colombia; and the setting for “Teresa” is contemporary Mexico.

Hugo Chavez and his successor Maduro are exuberantly despised by the elite white-supremacist minority. They still call Chavez negro, savage, monkey and ape. Maduro gets the same; and the media never fails to remind the public that he was a former bus driver, which is code for “low-class”. Maduro is proud of his humble beginning as a bus driver and his Afro-Indigenous ethnicity. Chavez was proud of his poor Afro-Indigenous background too, and his final resting place is in the barrio where he and Maduro came from.

In 1998 the elite white minority was voted out of the presidential residence Miraflores Palace. Instead of being purged by Chavez, as an authoritarian dictator would have done, the elites maintained their political power base, dominance in commerce, and control of the media. They have been trying to get back the Miraflores Palace, and indignantly consider it their birthright. They have used every means at their command, and even invited the US to invade the country, which would result in thousands of deaths.

In April 2002 the elite white minority tried a coup against Chavez, backed and financed by the US, which failed. In December 2002 they tried a strike by the management at the Venezuelan oil company Petróleos de Venezuela. They tried a recall referendum against Chavez in 2004, and lost at the polls. They tried to unify the opposition political parties with the sole purpose of defeating Maduro in 2013, and failed. They tried to delegitimize the 2018 presidential election by organizing a boycott. They tried to assassinate Maduro with a drone in 2018. Their attempts have failed.

The white elites have sabotaged the economy, used mass demonstrations, and organized violence. The self-appointed Juan Guaido declared himself the interim president, and called for a military coup d’etat, that failed miserably. Even with their control of the media and commerce they have failed to oust Maduro.

The elite upper class has millions of dollars of financial support from the US and Canada. Some of the EU countries, following pressure from the US, have thrown their support for the Guaido coup plotters too. The UK froze $1.2 billion of Venezuela’s much needed reserves for life-saving food and medicine. Spain turned its back on the people of Venezuela.

The above political caricature of Afro-Indigenous Hugo Chavez, is titled “Ape Commander”, an obvious racial slur. As the article Racism Without Shame in the Venezuelan Counter-Revolution from Venezuelanalysis explains:

The US and Canada have opposed the government of Venezuela since the election of Hugo Chavez in 1998. Chavez won the election by a landslide on his platform of participatory democracy, local governance, frequent elections, rewriting the constitution, social reforms, healthcare for all, free education, adult literacy programs, and other basic economic freedoms. He called his platform the Bolivarian Revolution, his movement is called Chavismo, his followers are called Chavistas and they are fiercely loyal to Maduro. Maduro is fiercely loyal to Chavez’s memory, and the Bolivarian process. The country is renamed The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, after el libertador Simon Bolivar.

The Bolivarian process has had dramatic success in reducing inequality, cutting poverty in half, providing adequate housing, fighting child malnutrition, improving public education, practically eliminating adult illiteracy, reducing unemployment, and providing social security. (See appendix A for economic charts of the success of the Bolivarian Revolution, or click the link HERE.) The US and Canada are trying to destroy the successes of the Bolivarian process with an illegal economic blockade and violent subversion.

Before his death, Chavez endorsed his Vice President Nicolas Maduro as his successor. Chavez died in March of 2013, and a new election as required by the constitution was held in April. Maduro won by a surprisingly small margin of 1.5% against the pro-business opponent Henrique Capriles. The opposition cried foul as they always do when they lose.

Venezuela has a voting system with both an electronic ballot and a hard copy, which Jimmy Carter called the best voting technology in the world in 2012. In that election, which Carter monitored, Chavez beat Capriles by a landslide, 55.1% to 44.3%. Still, the US and the mainstream media called Chavez a dictator. Now they call Maduro a dictator.

In the 2018 presidential election Maduro won easily with 67.8% of the vote against his two opponents Henri Falcón and Javier Bertucci. Maduro had invited the United Nations to send election observers, but the UN declined because the opposition told the UN not to come. Why would the opposition disinvite the UN if they thought the election was going to be rigged? Answer, because they have given up on democratic elections. They are outnumbered by the politically awakened poor, Afro-Indigenous, and people of color who live in the barrios.

The US and Canada are violating international law and the UN Charter by interfering in the internal affairs of Venezuela. The fact that Venezuela has tremendous wealth in oil, gold, precious earth, minerals and abundant natural and human resources is the obvious lure in whetting their greed.

The killer economic blockade that the US and members of the Lima Group (a US-controlled international cabal designed as a propaganda prop to legitimate attacks on Venezuela’s government) have imposed is causing tens of thousands of deaths, needless suffering, and is destroying Venezuela’s economy. The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) estimates that 40,000 Venezuelans have died as a direct result of the economic blockade. Since the blockade is intentionally targeting civilians, it is a violation of the Geneva Conventions, and a crime against humanity.

The CEPR disputes the US, Canadian, and mainstream media narrative that Nicolas Maduro is the blame for the current economic crisis. Mark Weisbrot of CEPR says that denying that the blockade is the cause of Venezuela’s economic crisis is like “climate change denial”.

The US and the mainstream media blame Maduro for “wrecking” the economy. They blame the Bolivarian process for having spent too much on social programs for the poor, not diversifying the economy, not fighting crime, and not putting away reserves in anticipation of low oil prices. The problem is that it is not true. Watch the 17-minute interview of Mark Weisbrot below:

According to a United Nation’s analysis, and 150 experts and activists, the economic slump from falling oil prices was exacerbated by Obama’s economic sanctions in 2015. The blockade imposed by Trump and the Lima Group in 2017 has sent the economy into crisis. That is what economic sanctions are intended to do, as is well-known (e.g. “make the economy scream.”).

Other oil dependent countries in the region are struggling through the depression in oil prices. Venezuela could have too, except for the economic blockade, confiscation of Venezuela’s US oil company Citgo, and the freezing of assets by the US, Canada, and the EU countries. The constant threat of a US invasion diverts needed resources to increased defense spending, which is another drain on the economy.

What the US and Canada are doing to Venezuela meets the definition of terrorism. They are using violence against civilians, starving them to death and preventing life-saving medicine from getting through, for political and economic purposes. It is robbery in plain sight, but many people believe the mainstream media propaganda, rather than their own “lying eyes”. The blindness is caused by “blockade denial”.

The elite white minority of Venezuelans want control of the vast wealth of Venezuela’s natural resources, and the US and Canada are helping for their own imperial designs. It is a historical pattern. The US and Canada have long supported dictators and opposed anti-colonial and democratic movements in the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa and Asia. Before the rise of the US Empire, Canada backed the British Empire in the Caribbean, and even considered annexing its own colonies in the West Indies. Now the UK and Canada are the US Empire’s junior imperial partners.

After the 1898 Spanish-American war the US colonized Cuba and Puerto Rico, as well as the Philippines. The US invaded Mexico in 1914 to support the oligarchy against the nationalists. The US refused to recognize Haiti’s government until 1862, even though it had gained independence from France in 1804. The US militarily occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934. During the Spanish Civil War, the US supported the fascist dictator Franco.

Some of the most notorious dictators that the US has backed are Batista in Cuba, Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, Pinochet in Chile, Noriega in Panama, and “Papa Doc” and “Baby Doc” Duvalier in Haiti. During the 1980’s the US sponsored death squads in Central America. The US backed the French in Indochina and Africa, the British in the Middle East and the 1982 colonial Falkland Island War. The US backed Suharto of Indonesia in his genocidal invasion of East Timor. The US backed apartheid South Africa, and had Nelson Mandela on its terrorist list until 2008. Is this the picture of a country that loves democracy and human rights?

Just as the US overthrew a democratic government in Guatemala in 1954 for United Fruit Company, the US is now trying to overthrow a democratic government in Venezuela for the benefit of US oil companies, and Canadian mining companies. And just as neocon Elliot Abrams was in charge of the death-squads in Central America during the 1980’s, he is now Trump’s special envoy for Venezuela. To believe that the US wants to “restore democracy” in Venezuela takes cognitive dissonance.

The US is supporting a cabal of elite white supremacists in Venezuelan to push the Washington Consensus of IMF loans, privatization of state-owned enterprises, invasion of foreign capital, Structural Adjustment Programs (SAP) by the IMF, neoliberal debt slavery and austerity for the poor, Afro-Indigenous, and people of color. Even Monsantois behind the coup because Venezuela is one of the few countries that bans cancer causing Roundup and GMO seeds.

An article in the Journal of the US Army from 2005 laid out in detail the US’s objections against the Bolivarian process. Even when there was no question about the legitimacy of the elections and the economy was doing great, the US was planning a coup d‘etat. One reason is oil, and the US Army article is blunt about it:

So, the US and Venezuela disagree on their “preference” for “this strategic asset”. The Venezuelan people want to use their oil wealth for the benefit of Venezuelans, and the US objects? Of course, Canada’s “preference” is for Canadian mining companies to control Venezuela’s gold too.

Venezuela is a sovereign country, a member of the United Nations, and Maduro is the internationally recognized president. (A status the US and its vassals and allies in crime continually work to undermine). Venezuela has the right to choose its own preferences. What the article calls “this strategic asset” is not up for grabs. The US and Canada don’t have a right to vote on it. The fact that the US and Canada even think that they can dictate ownership of “this strategic asset”, shows how arrogant and bullying they are. This is the 21st century, the Monroe Doctrine should be dead, and the Caribbean and Latin America ain’t nobody’s “backyard”.

The US Army article further whines that Chavez and Maduro encouraged the unity of South America, challenging US hegemony. Venezuela has a right to its own foreign relations. Other invented crimes are that Venezuela backed a stronger OPEC, and opposed the illegal Invasion of Iraq, and the Worldwide War on Terror. Venezuela has good relations with Cuba and Nicaragua, thus irritating the US further.

Strangely, the US Army article finds the Bolivarian process of “participatory democracy” rather than “representative democracy” to be nefarious? It’s odd that the US would object to the Venezuelan people having more democracy and local control, rather than less. Try explaining to Chavistas how Trump became president even though he got fewer votes than Clinton, and they will laugh in your face about “representative democracy”.

What is depressing is that most of the North American public is still fooled by the US propaganda that it is motivated by democracy and human rights. The historical evidence is to the contrary. The US is a serial predator of illegal wars of aggression, which have killed millions of people, and Canada has been right there side-by-side. They have invaded at least a half-dozen countries in the past few decades, and they are threatening a half-dozen more. The US has imposed illegal economic sanctions on Russia, Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Venezuela. The US State Department has bragged that the sanctions are “working” because civilians are dying. That is not concern for human rights. It is coercion, hostage taking and demands for ransom.

The US often violates international law, reneges on treaties, ignores the United Nations, defies the International Criminal Court, and breaks domestic laws. It conducts illegal wars of aggression, drone assassinations, night raids, and covert operations . The US supplies weapons, logistics and ammunition that are used by Israel and Saudi Arabia to kill civilians. The US supports 70% of the world’s dictators. Does any of that fit with a country that is concerned about democracy and human rights? The US and Canada are recklessly instigating a bloody civil war in Venezuela.

A State Department official named Brian Hook in a leaked memo disabused his boss at that time, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, about the actual aims of US foreign policy. The memo tutored Tillerson that the US is only interested in weaponizing democracy and human rights to destabilize adversaries. The US should treat friendly dictatorships, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Honduras, “different and better”, according to Hook.

As Hook explains, agitating countries about democracy and human rights is destabilizing, and the US does not want to do that to friendly dictators. With adversaries though, the US wants to destabilize them even if they are democracies, like Venezuela. For adversaries, they are never democratic enough to please the US. They should be destabilized and kept off balance, according to Hook.

It is false that US foreign policy objectives are for the benefit of the US public. US foreign policy is for the benefit of corporations, special interest groups and oligarchs. The beneficiaries of US foreign policy are the elites, and they grease US foreign policy with campaign contributions, bribes and other perks to government officials.

What drives US foreign policy is the quest for absolute military superiority, preservation of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency, maintaining the capitalist world order, controlling the world’s natural and human resources, promoting a stable business-friendly environment for Western transnational corporations, and seeking opportunities for windfall profits for cronies.

In other words, the US wants to control the whole world. If that means overthrowing non-compliant democratically elected governments and supporting military coups and dictators, killing millions of people, then as far as the US is concerned, so be it. That is criminally insane.

It is the US public that pays for US foreign policy and wars, either through taxes or by the lack of government programs, such as universal healthcare, education, mass transit and a “Green New Deal”. US foreign policy does not keep the American people safer. Wars and the threat of wars make the American people less safe.

The foreign policy elites, also called the “power elite”, which is a phrase coined by C. Wright Mills in his book The Power Elite, are a closely knit alliance of “military, government, and corporate officials perceived as the center of wealth and political power in the US”. The power elite usually come from wealthy families. They all went to Ivy League schools, they belong to the same country clubs, they are members of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and the Bilderberg group. They sit on the boards of corporations, the media, banks, foundations, universities, and think tanks; and they become Senators and Presidents.

The power elite is a clique. The members all go to the same cocktail parties, their spouses are friends, and their children go to private schools together. Those not born into the power elite have to earn admission by being faithful servants, and climb to the top while they gain experience, power and influence. The power elite is the Deep State. The Deep State makes US foreign policy and declares war; not the American people. The American people pay, but do not get to “play”.

The Deep State, and those that serve it, such as John Bolton and Mike Pompeo, have no moral and legal restraints.

Humanitarian interventionists, the right to protect (R2P), American values, democracy and human rights are weaponized, as Hook explained to Tillerson. It is all about US hegemony and world domination. Under three US presidents, Bush, Obama and Trump, the US has been trying to overthrow the government of Venezuela.

Twenty years ago, the democratically elected president of Venezuela became a target of the US. There was no question that the election was fair, democratic and it was declared so by international observers, including the Carter Center. Hugo Chavez won the presidency by a landslide. Instead of cheering for democracy at work, the US and Canada soon started plotting to overthrow the elected government.

In 2002 the US backed an unsuccessful military coup d’etat. The US immediately endorsed the coup government, and the mainstream media cheered. The coup failed because the people demanded a return of their kidnapped president. Within 48 hours Hugo Chavez was back in the Miraflores Palace.

Below is a 15-minute documentary on the 2002 coup attempt and the US involvement. The video features Eva Golinger. Golinger is a US attorney who has followed events in Venezuela for decades, she was a legal advisor to Hugo Chavez, and she has written several books. The most well-known is The Chavez Code: Cracking US Intervention in Venezuela.

So, how does the US square what it now says is its concern for democracy, when the US tried to overthrow the government in 2002, regardless of it being a democratically elected government? The US’s fallback argument is that an adversary is never democratic enough, as Hook explained.

It is the same answer the US gave in 1954 when it overthrew the democratically elected president of Guatemala, Jacobo Árbenz. It is the same answer the US gave in 1973 when it overthrew and assassinated Chile’s democratically elected president, Salvador Allende. It is the same answer it gave in the 1980’s when it was backing the Contras in Nicaragua. It is the same answer the US gave when it overthrew the democratically elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti in 1994, and then overthrew him again when he was elected in 2004. It is the same answer that the US gave when it backed the military coup in Honduras in 2009. For the US, an adversary is never democratic enough, and it must go.

Maduro must go because he is costing US and Canadian corporations and banks money. He challenges the Washington Consensus. Maduro threatens US hegemony in Latin America and the Caribbean. Those are unforgiveable sins in the eyes of the US. It is like putting a great big bull’s eye on your back. Being a US target has nothing to do with democracy and human rights.

Vice President Pence and Prime Minister Trudeau met in Ottawa at the end of May. In their joint statement they spoke about many issues that the US and Canada share. They chitchatted about their peaceful borders, joked about basketball rivalry, and spared about trade. One issue that they agreed on was Venezuela. Both said that President Nicolas Maduro must go. When the US says “must go”, it includes assassination.

Here is what Trudeau had to say on Venezuela:

Restoring democracy in Venezuela is a red herring. The US and Canadian foreign policies are not concerned about democracy. It is lip service for the home folks. US foreign policy has always preferred strong dictators and puppet governments in their “back yard”. The US and Canada have historically exploited their backyard for its natural resources, tropical monocrops, cheap labor, and schemes to get rich. Those that have opposed the US and Canada can be found in mass graves all over the Caribbean and Latin American.

Trump is refreshingly crude, compared to the smooth-talking Obama. Reportedly when Trump first took office, one of his first questions was why is the US not at war with Venezuela, since they have all that oil and they are right in the our backyard?

International law is meaningless to the US, and that is not new with Trump. The US has a long history of ignoring international law. Both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump’s national security advisor John Bolton have a vision of the world as the wild west, with no international law, just anarchy. It is the cynical view that might-makes-right, and that the US is above the law.

It was the Bill Clinton administration that injected new currency into the phrases American exceptionalism and the indispensable nation. That was the polite way to say that the US is above the law. It is just that Trump, Bolton, Pompeo, and Abrams do not have good manners. That is not a policy change, it’s Trump stepping into an imperial presidency that was left to him by Bush and Obama.

Oh, the Trump administration still speaks out of both sides of its mouth with platitudes that the US is a force for good in the world, and that its values are democracy and human rights. Only fools believe that anymore.

This graph shows overall GDP growth as well as per-capita growth in the pre-Chávez (1986-1999) era and the Chávez presidency.

From 1999-2003, the government did not control the state oil company; in fact, it was controlled by his opponents, who used it to try to overthrow the government, including the devastating oil strike of 2002–2003. For that reason, a better measure of economic growth under the Chávez government would start after it got control over the state oil company, and therefore the economy.

Above you can see this growth both measured from 2004, and for the 1999-2012 period. We use 2004 because to start with 2003, a depressed year due to the oil strike, would exaggerate GDP growth during this period; by 2004, the economy had caught up with its pre-strike level of output. Growth after the government got control of the state oil company was much faster.

This graph shows the growth of the private sector versus the public sector during the Chávez years.

4. Unemployment Rate: Before and After Oil Strike

After the oil strike (and the deep recession that it caused) ended in 2003, unemployment dropped drastically, following many years of increases before Chávez was elected. In 1999, when Chávez took office, unemployment was 14.5 percent; for 2011 it was 7.8 percent.

Poverty has decreased significantly, dropping by nearly 50 percent since the oil strike, with extreme poverty dropping by over 70 percent.

The Gini coefficient, measuring income inequality, fell from 0.5 to 0.397, the lowest Gini coefficient in the region.

Social spending doubled from 11.3 percent of GDP in 1998 to 22.8 percent of GDP in 2011.

The number of Venezuelans receiving pensions has increased from less than 500,000 in 1999 to nearly 2 million in 2011.

334,"The Egyptian pyramids are some of the most incredible man-made structures in history. More than 4,000 years after their construction, the pyramids still stand as some of the most important and mysterious tombs in the world. Their design remains a true testament to the wealth and power of the ancient Egyptian civilization.

Pharaohs of ancient Egypt held immense power and were perceived to have been chosen by the gods. They were held in high regard even after death because it was believed that part of their spirit would remain with their bodies in the physical world. Through the process of mummification, a pharaoh would be prepared for the afterlife and buried in tombs alongside his most valuable possessions, including art, furniture, gold, food and other offerings.

The earliest forms of the pyramids, called ""mastabas,"" were royal tombs carved into rock and were very different from Egypt's iconic pyramids. These tombs were rectangular and flat-roofed. By the start of the third dynasty, tombs in Egypt developed into more complex structures. Around 2630 B.C. an early pyramid built for King Djoser, called the Step Pyramid, stood 204 feet tall and was the highest structure of its time.

It would not be until the fourth dynasty that ancient Egyptians started building the first smooth-sided pyramids. The Red Pyramid, named for the reddish hue of its red limestone stones, was the first of its kind, built for the burial of the first king of the fourth dynasty, Sneferu (2613-2589 B.C.).

Possibly the best-known pyramids are the Great Pyramids of Giza. The largest, known as the Great Pyramid, is the only surviving structure among the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was built for Khufu (2609-2584 B.C.), Sneferu’s successor. An estimated 2.3 million blocks of stone (averaging about 2.5 tons each) were cut, transported and assembled to build Khufu’s Great Pyramid. This group of pyramids also includes another Egyptian icon: The Great Sphinx.

These grand tombs were built to last, and still draw millions of visitors each year. Although they are stripped of their white limestone coverings and vandals new and old have robbed their treasures, the Egyptian pyramids continue to evoke wonder and awe.

881,"The former Google engineer who called YouTube’s algorithm change that buried “conspiracy theory” content a “historic victory” is now investigating why Jordan Peterson’s videos are so popular on the platform, emphasizing once again how ‘conspiracy theories’ are being conflated with dissident political opinions to justify a new wave of censorship.

YouTube recently announced it would stop recommending videos that contained “conspiracy theory” content or were deemed to be ‘misleading’.

This was in reaction to a BuzzFeed article which conflated conspiracy theory content with videos by mainstream conservative commentators like Ben Shapiro, Prager University and philosopher Jordan Peterson.

Now an ex-Google engineer who previously worked on YouTube’s algorithm has shifted his attention to finding out why Peterson’s videos get so much traction.

In a thread about YouTube’s decision to “stop recommending some conspiracy theories such as flat earth,” Guillaume Chaslot said the change was a “historic victory,” before going on to claim that watching conspiracy videos causes social isolation and even murder.

“This AI change will save thousands from falling into such rabbit holes,” tweeted Chaslot.

However, like BuzzFeed’s original article, he once again conflated “conspiracy theories” with right of center political content, claiming that the AI needs to be changed to stop “political abuse” and “radicalization,” two terms routinely used by the left to argue for censorship of conservatives.

When Chaslot was asked why YouTube kept recommending Jordan Peterson’s videos to everyone, he responded, “I’m working on a piece to explain that – Hint 1: men spend 40% more time on YouTube than women – Hint 2: which men spend the most time YouTube?”

As we previously warned, clamping down on “conspiracy theories,” “misleading” content and other such vague terms is merely a backdoor through which YouTube will go to even greater lengths to silence opinions that challenge the Silicon Valley consensus.

1334,"This article is the third in a series of three by Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner, the authors of the new book, "" The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) This is the third in a series of three op-eds tracing the long path of Vice President Mike Pence's ambition, from college, where he found a form of evangelicalism that weds theology to Republican politics, to the national stage -- and a job that puts him a short step away from the presidency. Part one: Mike Pence's plan to outlast Trump Part two: Mike Pence went to college and found God

Mike Pence won his first political campaign in 2000 using what became his basic strategy of guns, God, and money. He raised lots of cash by appealing to big-time conservative donors -- among them, Betsy DeVos, Charles and David Koch, and Erik Prince -- with hawkish positions on taxes and regulation. He found his voters at churches and gun clubs. He spiced his recipe with attacks on science that placed him to the right of many of his fellow Republicans.

Like a handful of Republicans, Pence made an issue of the pending agreement to settle government lawsuits against tobacco companies for lying for decades about the dangers of their addictive products. Pence didn't just oppose the deal. He insisted it was based on a lie and the result of a pernicious government plot.

""Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media,"" Pence wrote in 2000 , ""smoking doesn't kill. In fact, 2 out of every three smokers does not die from a smoking related illness and 9 out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer.""

Pence's first bit of data was simply wrong. Two-thirds of smokers actually do die of smoking-related illnesses. His second was misleading. Lung cancer is a relatively rare illness, but it is still vastly more common among smokers. In fact, it is one of the few cancers for which science has established a very well-known cause, and Pence's column was published after industry leaders had acknowledged the health risks of their product.

Why would a candidate for Congress speak so falsely and recklessly? Pence's motivation may have been connected to his family's ownership stake in a chain of convenience stores called Tobacco Road, which sold cigarettes alongside soft drinks and chips. But he was also eager to establish some libertarian street cred. ""A government big enough to go after smokers is big enough to go after you,"" he wrote.

If Pence's vocabulary was a bit 19th-century, so was his thinking. After calling Charles Darwin ""a sincere biologist,"" Pence attacked the science of evolution, which, in his telling, was conjecture and thus no worthier of respect than other notions about the origins of life. Darwin ""hoped that some day it would be proven by the fossil record but did not live to see that,"" declared Pence, ""nor have we.""

Of course, there is nothing uncertain in the prevailing science on the origins of life on Earth. As the National Academy of Science explains, a scientific theory is not merely conjecture. It is ""a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence."" This is why physicists still talk about a ""theory"" of gravity that explains why objects fall down and not up and biologists speak of ""cell theory,"" even though the fact that living things are composed of cells is established truth.

A willful denial of the facts was required for Pence to press his case against Darwin, but he was clearly devoted to this cause. Having cast doubt on the science of evolution, he said that he was only asking for everyone to be open-minded. ""I would simply and humbly ask ... can we also consider teaching other theories of the origin of species?""

Then, he declared that his own mind was shut.

""The Bible tells us that God created man in his own imagine, male and female,"" said Pence. ""He created them. And I believe that.""

Pence's speech on evolution, preserved on C-SPAN, was delivered in the cadence of a radio preacher. Pence had developed this way of speaking during his years as a broadcaster, when he pitched himself as ""Rush Limbaugh on decaf."" But as friendly as he sounded, Pence was determined to impose his religious views through public policy and to do it through the manipulation of language.

Another example was his proposal to use federal funds to turn gay people straight. So-called ""conversion therapy,"" promoted by quacks and religious bigots, assumes that homosexuality is a medically treatable pathology, which it is not. Pence's proposal never gained traction in Congress, but it was a loud dog whistle to those on the homophobic Christian right.

With his sights set on the White House, Pence sought executive experience back home in Indiana, where a GOP advantage in registration helped him win a narrow victory in the 2012 governor's race. He installed his wife, Karen, in an office at the state house, a first for first ladies of the state, and had a pair of red phones wired to connect his desk directly with hers.

Pence was unremarkable as governor, save for his commitment to the causes of Christian conservatives in pushing a state law that permitted discrimination against gay customers by businesses. When Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 2015 was approved, Pence signed it into law in a rare, private ceremony where he was flanked by clergy from a variety of religions.

Reaction to RFRA and the photo was intense. Pence backed down, seeking amendments that watered down the law. But while the episode seemed to threaten his future, he was rescued by Donald Trump's offer to join his ticket as the GOP's 2016 candidate for vice president.

Six months into the new administration, Republicans were already talking about how Pence seemed to be running a shadow campaign to become the GOP nominee for president in the event that Trump was felled by either the Russia scandal or some other force. Pence's chief of staff is a sharp-elbowed political player named Nick Ayers, and his connections to big donors are strong. Organized and methodical where the President is chaotic and impulsive, Pence is ready to achieve the dream he believes God wants him to fulfill.

Should Pence achieve his goal, he would likely remake the GOP, now almost a cult devoted to Donald Trump, as a Christian right political party where people of other faiths would struggle to find a home. Instead of policy driven by personality, a Pence administration would likely pursue policy guided by a particular reading of the Bible. And the divisions that now seem to be separating Americans would become broader, deeper, and even more difficult to bridge.",mainstream
120,"Having financial hang-ups, the spy-riddled, oil-soaked, heavily tax-cheating Monopoly Press cannot bring you a balanced view of any subject. If you are well-informed, you certainly know that. So, some will like what they read here. Others, will not. Before he became Pope, he was Papal Nuncio in Berlin. Some contend he was supportive of the rise of Adolf Hitler. For some years before, during, and after World War Two, he was Pope Pius 12th. Some authors accused him of being pro-Nazi. [""The Deputy"" by Rolf Hochhuth. ""Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII"", by John Cornwell,1999.] It is beyond dispute that after World War Two, Pius assisted wanted war-criminal Nazis to escape down the ""Rat-lines"" to the U.S. South America, and Croatia. As a young man, he was a theater expert and actor. During his later career,was he just acting as well? During World War Two, he held a position in a facility of I.G. Farben, the Nazi poison gas factory, part of a chemical cartel. [For background, ""The Crime and Punishment of I.G. Farben"" by Joseph Borkin.] Karol Wojtyla was a sort of chief assistant to the Bishop of Krakow, who being pro-Nazi, controlled fellow Poles with an iron fist and kept them submissive and docile for the benefit of the German occupation forces. Later, far too many Poles claimed they knew nothing of the round-up of the Jews from the ghettoes and transporting them to concentration camp for slave labor for I.G. Farben. Millions of Jews, labor leaders, and other ""enemies of the State"" were worked to death while being starved. Elderly and disabled Jews were quickly disposed of; they were of no use in the Nazi war factories. Most Poles later either denied knowing of this when it was happening or claimed they did not participate in the crimes against humanity. Presumably, Wojtyla took the same position as his fellow Poles. In his later career, did anyone in the Monopoly Press ever dare ask him? Then there is the story of another one. In 1978, in their secret Conclave, the Cardinals selected another Italian to be Pope, John Paul 1st. But, soon it became evident from a geopolitical and religious standpoint, they most likely made a wrong selection. He soon enough let it be known that he was for modifying the Vatican position of absolute prohibition for Catholics to use birth control. In simple terms, he was against birthing more children than a couple could financially take care of. It was a reasonable , humane position to non-Catholics. Furthermore, he was determined to put an end to the traditional Sicilian and Italian Mafia, jointly with certain corrupt Archbishops, and the American CIA, in using the Vatican Bank as a money laundry for stolen gold treasuries, dope money, illlcit weapons deals, assassination funds, and superior counterfeit currency dealings, among other dirty, bloody business. Some Italian editors dared demand that Pope John Paul 1st, do something about the Continental Bank of Chicago, the majority owners jointly being the Vatican and the Queen of England. The bank, some Italian editors stated, was a laundry for the Mafia. [As we dared point out publicly, the Chief Judge of the Chicago Federal Appeals Court, Walter Cummings, Jr., was a ""man of trust"" for the Vatican, and held a large block of shares, as nominee and front man for the Pope. Judge Cummings, a banker-judge, did NOT disqualify himself when his Continental Bank and their major clients were litigants in his tribunal. Guess who won in his crooked Court?] [As predicted accurately by this writer, Continental Bank collapsed in 1984 and was taken over later by Bank of America owned jointly by the Jesuits and the Japanese underworld, the Yakuza.] Thirty three days after taking office, Pope John Paul 1st was poisoned with a cup of tea. It was a symbolic warning and death warrant by the Free Masons, the Jesuits, and Opus Dei, the super-fascist, super-secret group (by 2005, Opus Dei occupying their own large building in New York city). [More details of the plot against Pope John Paul 1st in the book ""In God's Name"" by David Yallop.] Thereafter, the Vatican secret Conclave of Cardinals put together a scheme, with the urging of the American CIA, to topple the Soviet government. To understand the rationale, you have to have a good understanding of history.The Anglo-American Aristocracy financed the rise of the Nazis and Adolf Hitler, as a bulwark against the Soviets. In the beginning, the Prussian/German Aristocracy was reluctant to finance Hitler. [See, ""Who Financed Hitler"" by Susan Poole.] With his background with the pro-Nazi Polish Bishop of Krakow, Wojtyla was a suitable and forceful Anti-Communist. But he lacked humanity for Italians. In 1979, there was a terrible earthquke in the historically impoverished southern part of Italy. The destitute Italians demanded that John Paul 2nd, the new Pontiff, relieve some of their suffering, by sending them financial aid from his Mafia/American CIA controlled Vatican Bank. The Pope refused. John Paul 2nd kept censored, as best he could, through his helpers, Vatican Intelligence, of the growing scandal of international swindler Michele Sindona operating through the Vatican Bank and the Vatican-owned Continental Bank of Chicago. Starting about 1980, the American CIA jointly with a deal with the bosses of Time Magazine, arranged tremendous secret financing for their paid-for Polish provocateur, Lech Walesa. As a leader of the Polish Solidarity Movement, Walesa stirred up the workers at the Lenin Shipyards at Gdansk. As the Soviets understood it, Pope John Paul 2nd, by his statements and speeches, jointly with Western paid-for provocateur Lech Walesa, was stirring up fellow Poles in rebellion against the Moscow government.To the Soviets, Wojtyla was a rotten intermeddler, considering how many Soviet lives were lost in freeing Poland from the Germans. In May, 1981, a deranged supposed left-wing Turk, was grabbed after reportedly being the ""lone assassin"" atttempting to kill Pope John Paul 2nd by shooting him in the abdomen right in Vatican Square. Thereafter, two opposing spy shops released supposed details that the other side instigated the would-be assassin. The American CIA planted a flood of apparently phony details that the Bulgarian Secret Police were accomplices of the Turk in Italy and maybe even right in Vatican Square. Various international inquiries tended to show the CIA stories had no basis. On the other hand, the Soviets planted stories that seemed to have ""legs"". The Soviets made a compelling case that the supposed deranged Turk was part of a RIGHT-wing Military group in Turkey financed by the American CIA. These two versions tended to cancel each other out. Left unanswered were questions that the Polish Solidarity Movement was reportedly not receiving the funding promised them by the West. So, wounding Wojtyla right on the grounds of the Vatican, was perceived by savvy folks as a way of reminding the West to send more money to the Solidarity Movement. Or, maybe it was just a leftover warning for the Pope to be sure to keep covered up the Sindona scandal. After all, some claimed Sindona's main efforts in accounting were to whisk huge Italian business funds out of Italy to escape the tax collectors. Or, wounding the Pope was a way for the southern Italians and the Sicilians to remind the Pontiff not to be so stingy refusing earthquake relief funds in 1979. Compare the following with the position of the murdered Pope John Paul 1st regarding possibly modifying the Church's position on birth control. When Pope John Paul 2nd visited Mexico, implicit in his statements was that he was urging Mexicans to go full speed ahead in fathering children. Yet, Mexico City, for example, is over-populated with more than 32 million inhabitants. The authorities have no funds left for sanitation. So the streets in many poor sections become the toilet and dumping grounds. It makes for a terribly unhealthy situation. The Pope offered no remedy, only being interested in more members for his Church.. Over a number of years, Pope John Paul 2nd made apologies for various historical crimes of his Church. For example, in 1492, Columbus landed in the new world. Thereafter, the Catholic Church committed terrible crimes against the natives of Mexico and Central America and black and other slaves. Five hundred years later, in 1992, Pope John Paul 2nd visited Central America and made apologies for the crimes of five hundred years previous. To some it was an idle gesture. And the Pope visited a memorial to the Holocaust in Israel and made apologies there. To some, it was an idle, worthless ceremony. Seldom mentioned in Pope John Paul 2nd's efforts to topple the Soviet Union, was the more important purpose of the Vatican. That is, to smash, if possible, the Eastern Orthodox Church, a competitor if not enemy of the Vatican for more than a thousand years. Some people conveniently forget a few things. Such as, Popes up to the beginning of the 19th Century, threatened to throw members out of the Church, excommunicate them, for daring to say the Earth is not flat. That is, the Vatican was the headquarters of the Flat Earth Committee. Also, did any Pope ever urge Scientific progress in medicines, healthcare, transportation, communications? Or urge progress in labor-saving machinery so human beings would not be just above a pack animal? Why does it seem the Popes have their Church in full reverse gear instead of forward and progressive?

402,"Ever since the coronavirus spread across the world, suspicions have proliferated about what is really going on. Questions arose about the origins of the virus, the way it makes people sick, the mitigation measures taken, the suspended civil rights, the connection with 5G, possible cures and medications, and about the role of Bill Gates in it all.

These ideas are commonly framed as conspiracy theories. Yes, they may all distrust the mainstream narrative and share certain characteristics, but they are not one of a kind.

They take so many different forms and have such varying degrees of plausibility that I question how useful it is to bracket them all under the same banner. To understand and effectively respond to the various coronavirus conspiracy theories, we need to dig deeper.

Listen to our Expert guide to conspiracy theories, a series by The Conversation’s The Anthill podcast.

The dominant explanation for the popularity of coronavirus conspiracy theories is remarkably similar: these dark and unsettling ideas help people make sense of a complex and uncertain world. They provide sufficiently large explanations for tragic events, and give back feelings of agency and control.

Since these ideas sometimes have real-world consequences, from 5G masts set on fire to ignoring coronavirus mitigation measures, various commentators condemn these conspiracy theories. Officials now need not only fight a health pandemic, so their story goes, but an infodemic too.

The problem with the generalising approach is threefold. It does not account for the motivations of conspiracy theorists themselves; nor for the different forms and plausibility of the various conspiracy theories; nor for their relations with various political and societal issues.

Providing uniform explanations for conspiracy theories fails to seriously consider their contents or underlying concerns. Similarly, it leaves untouched how certain conspiracy theories are weaponised in various propaganda wars.

A closer look at these theories or – even better – actual engagement with the people propagating them, shows conspiracy theories not so much as a uniform coping strategy in unsettling times, but rather as a wide array of cultural expressions.

These include suspicions of planned efforts to impose mass vaccinations, doubts about the origins of the virus, expressions of disgust for the ruling elite, geopolitical insinuations, pointers to an inflated media panic, the scapegoating of certain societal groups (Chinese or Jews), critiques on the methods and measurements of COVID-19 symptoms and deaths, discontents with powerful philanthropists, worries about the expansion of authoritarian government policies, or concerns about corporate intrusion in the search for effective medications.

This means, as I argue in my recent book, that we need to focus on the meaning, diversity and context of different conspiracy theories, as well as the people who subscribe to them.

During my ethnographic research projects on contemporary conspiracy cultures, I encountered a wide variety of people, ideas, practices and communities. Because coronavirus conspiracy theories have yet to settle down, let’s turn to some markedly different conspiracy theory subcultures that have been around for longer. They illustrate how different conspiracy theories and the people who subscribe to them can be.

Starting with the anti-vaccination movement – of great concern to many. Because many anti-vaxxers in the western world are highly educated urban hipsters, it is difficult to reject them as ignorant deplorables.

Read more: Throwing science at anti-vaxxers just makes them more hardline

Next to critiques of Big Pharma, vaccine hesitancy is informed by holistic and naturalistic ideas about health and the body; ideas rooted in alternative medicine and New Age spiritualities. In these subcultural worlds, emotions, feelings, experiences, testimonies and social relations are often more important guides than scientific knowledge.

Rather different are those active in the 9/11 Truth Movement. Broadly interested in geopolitics and government cover ups, these people challenge the mainstream narrative of 9/11 with competing factual and scientific evidence. They advance visual proofs and mathematical calculations of why the towers could not have collapsed by the planes, but indicate controlled demolition instead.

These activists profess knowledge of physics, construction and explosives, and ground their legitimacy in this expertise. They are focused on “exposing the official lies”. Like true activists, they wish revolutionary change, “to end the regime and illicit power structures responsible for 9/11”.

The list of markedly different conspiracy subcultures could go on. Think of the Flat Earthers, who deploy various scientific methodologies and perform actual experiments in the outside world to show that it is not a globe but a Truman Show-like dome.

Read more: I watched an entire Flat Earth Convention for my research – here's what I learnt

Favouring rational thinking and scientific methods is, however, no guarantee for brotherhood. 9/11 Truthers generally stay away from them as that would harm their credibility.

QAnon followers, meanwhile, deploy various strategies to interpret secret messages from their anonymous leader Q. These are known as “crumbs” or “drops” and are all part of their search for truth and redemption. Sharing many characteristics of millenarian New Religious Movements, QAnon followers anticipate a violent apocalypse when the conspiracy will be dismantled and followers will be vindicated.

This brief overview already shows the wide variety of themes, ideologies, plausibilities, origins, people and potential dangers of different conspiracy theory subcultures. Regarding conspiracy theories as one uniform category obscures all these differences and the various societal dynamics in which conspiracy theories play a role.

This inevitably leads to simplistic explanations. Further, it has the political effect of collectively stigmatising certain ideas and people – and prematurely excluding them from legitimate political debate. Conspiracy theories are not uniform – nor should our engagements with them be.",mainstream
1313,"As this decade comes to an end, there have been quite a few moments that people have hoped and prayed had never happened. While these 'foot-in-mouth' moments have numbered in the hundreds and thousands in this decade itself, we've rounded up ten of the choicest moments, some of them quite embarrassing for those concerned. This list of ten moments includes not just personalities in India and across the world, but also certain events that have had a number of consequences for those involved.

Here is a list of this decade's most 'foot-in-mouth' moments, in descending order:

Flat-earthers are those who believe, simply, that the earth is not round, but flat. No matter the evidence given, flat-earthers do not recognise the earth to be an oblate-spheroid, to use the terminology scientists have given to the planet's shape. This movement has been around for a long time, but has grown in popularity with the rise of social media and conspiracy theories. The movement has also attracted a few celebrities to ridicule or support the movement. In 2017, a rapper from the US started a GoFundMe page to crowdfund satellites to prove the earth was flat.

9. Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan's goof-ups on 'Koffee With Karan'

Bollywood celebrities Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan probably wished they would have brushed up on their general knowledge before slipping up on filmmaker Karan Johar's show, 'Koffee With Karan'. On being asked who the President of the country was, Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan said 'Prithviraj Chavan' and 'Manmohan Singh' respectively. Both celebrities were massively trolled online for their answers and were the laughing stock of social media users for quite a long time.

8. Fyre Festival and the 'sad' but viral cheese sandwich

The Fyre Festival promised to be a modern-day Woodstock, with the festival's organisers doubling down on the lavish promise of a grand music festival on an exotic island filled with food, drinks, music, luxurious bungalows to stay in and famous supermodels. Rich people who could afford the extravagant price tag, upwards of $10,000, flocked to the island, located in the Bahamas, only to be greeted with torrential rain a day before the festival was to kick off, small tents with dirty mattresses and...two breads with a cheese slice, tomato slices and lettuce leaves for food. A photo of the 'sad' cheese sandwich went viral on social media and marked the beginning of the end of festival. After a user posted the photo of the cheese sandwich, news of the disaster that was the Fyre Festival broke out and went viral on social media.

One of the festival's organisers Billy McFarland, was convicted of fraud, while the other, famous rapper Ja Rule, distanced himself from the festival.

Global soft drink brand Pepsi hoped to capitalise on the anti-establishment fervour in 2017, with an advertisement featuring celebrity socialite Kendall Jenner cutting across protestors and offering a policeman a can of Pepsi. With the 'Black Lives Matter' protests that had sparked in the US, the ad provoked an outcry and was widely derided on social media. Bernice King, the daughter of civil rights activist Martin Luther King, wrote a scathing response to the ad on Twitter: ""If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi,"" with a picture of her father being pushed by a police officer.

Union Minister Piyush Goyal became the centre of attention on social media in September this year while commenting on the state of the economy. Mr Goyal, while defending the government's handling of the economy, said ""If you're looking at a five trillion dollar economy, the country will have to grow at 12%. Today it's growing at 6%. Don't get into those maths. Those maths have never helped Einstein discover gravity... If you'd only gone by structured formulae and what was past knowledge, I don't think there would have been any innovation in this world"". Social media was quick to point out that it was Isaac Newton and not Albert Einstein who discovered gravity. After being derided for the remarks on social media, the minister said that some ""sought to remove the context, pick up one line and create a very mischievous narrative.""

'Alternative facts' was a phrase famously coined by US President Donald Trump's then White House advisor Kellyanne Conway. The phrase was coined after Trump's former White House press secretary Sean Spicer's alleged false statement on the number of people who had attended Trump's inauguration ceremony. Conway used the term to justify Spicer's claim that a large number of people had attended the ceremony, whereas photographic evidence proved otherwise.

Donald Trump has been notorious for his comments on climate change, including his recent barbs aimed at climate change activist, 16-year-old Greta Thunberg. ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,"" Trump had tweeted in 2012. In another tweet, Trump said that global warming was needed because it was freezing and snowing in New York.

Elon Musk stoked controversy last year, when the incident involving several children being trapped inside a cave in Thailand made headlines the world over, saw the tech billionaire play a role in rescue attempts as well. Following a disagreement with Vernon Unsworth, a British diver involved in rescuing the children, Elon Musk in a tweet, called him a ""pedo guy"". Unsworth had described Musk's proposal to build a mini-submarine to rescue the children as a ""PR stunt"". The comment has proved to be costly for Musk, with an ensuing lawsuit as well as several clarifications issued by him. As recently as this month, Musk's attorney Alex Spiro said ""pedo guy"" meant ""creepy old guy"" in South Africa, in a bid at damage control.

Former Junior Education Minister Satyapal Singh had last year claimed that the theory of evolution put forth by naturalist Charles Darwin was ""scientifically wrong"". ""Ever since humans came to Earth, they have always been humans,"" he had said, adding that ""Nobody, including our ancestors, have said or written that they ever saw an ape turning into a human being. No book we have read or the tales told to us by our grandparents had any such mention"". The comments provoked a sharp reaction from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in a harsh rebuke to his partymen, had said that ""we make mistakes and give 'masala' to the media... as if we are great social scientists and experts to analyse issues... the moment you see a camera you start speaking. So this half-baked stuff is picked up"".

The Indian Army in April this year, tweeted that it had spotted ""mysterious footprints of the mythical beast Yeti"", also known as the 'abominable snowman'. The army shared photos on Twitter claiming that a mountaineering expedition team had found the Yeti's ""mysterious footprints measuring 32X15 inches"".

In the images, the prints appear to be of a single foot. Scientists soon called for more credible proof before citing claims over the mythical beast, with one scientist telling NDTV that the finding by the army be ""best left as amateur speculation that needs to be debated further"". Social media didn't take too kindly over the army's claim either, with several users mocking it online. ""Couldn't you guys call a single animal expert before posting this?"" one person wrote, with another asking if it was a ""prank"". Yet another user mocked the image of the single footprint, saying that the beast ""travels by jumping.""",mainstream

139,"The New York Times tried its hand at a Star Wars meme to celebrate the launch of impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump – and proved what conservatives have been saying for years: the Left can’t meme.

“A long time coming for a White House far from reality,” the clip reads, before launching into scrolling text designed to mimic the opening to the Star Wars films. Titled “Episode 45,” the meme features two and a half minutes of every misdeed – real and imagined – committed by Trump during his presidency, heavy on the Russiagate conspiracy theorizing.

“Chaos has engulfed the republic,” the Times declares, referring to Trump’s “fresh assault on fair elections” – referring to his July phone call with the president of Ukraine in which he suggested reopening a corruption probe into the gas company that hired ex-Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter on its board – as “the last straw.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi swoops in “to restore some semblance of order to the universe” – and it’s all downhill from there, as accusations from the fictional (Trump gave classified info to foreign officials!) to the petty (Trump called a woman “horseface”!) scroll by.

The Times, which tweeted this creation under “opinions,” was savagely ratio’d, and some – including conservative meme-master Carpe Donktum, a favorite of the president himself – crafted their own responses.

Some made less sense than others.

Many were openly disdainful of the Times’ meme efforts: “People can die from cringe related illnesses guys. Do better,” tweeted one.

“I’m gonna subscribe to your paper just so I can cancel my subscription now,” wrote another. “What on earth is wrong with you people?” someone else wondered.

Others got into the Star Wars spirit while still managing to throw shade on the egregious construct.

But some found a silver lining. “The only redeeming quality of this tweet is the ratio,” one person commented, referring to the fact the tweet has been viewed and commented on many more times than it’s been retweeted or liked.

Just released this morning as the show was beginning — the “whistleblower complaint” that Democrats say warrants impeachment. It’s EXACTLY the opposite. A full exoneration of President Trump’s actions & an exposure of Democrat corruption and foreign collusion with Ukraine to interfere with the 2016 election.

Nuclear War Moves Accelerate After Pelosi Democrats Declare 6-Year-Old Girl Child Most Dangerous Person In

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

A grimly worded new Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today discussing the just completed meeting held between Accounts Chamber (the parliamentary body of financial control in the Russian Federation) Chairman Alexey Kudrin and US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan, states both parties, being the number one and number two oil producers in the world, expressed their grave concerns over the soon to be declared global coronavirus pandemic having now “triggered the biggest shock to oil markets since the Lehman banking crises brought the Western world to its knees in 2008”—a rare US-Russia consensus, however, that left neither party able to work towards finding a solution to keep this crisis from accelerating out of control—specifically because this crisis is occurring at the same time the United States can’t seem to cure itself of the schizophrenia disease it’s infected with—the symptoms of exhibited this week alone include the FBI and Department of Justice warning that “China Is America's Greatest Threat”, with US Attorney General William Barr further “sounding the alarm about the Chinese regime’s technological blitzkrieg on the United States”—warnings and alarms, though, immediately contradicted by US Navy Vice Admiral Andrew Lewis lyingly claiming that “Increased Russian sub activity means that the Navy no longer views sailing off the East Coast or across the Atlantic to be uncontested movements”—lying claims proving Admiral Lewis has never studied the Soviet history of flooding the US coast with submarines during the Cold War, nor his being aware that China and its allies North Korea and Iran have amassed 191 submarines against the US Navy’s 66—but which, nevertheless, saw Admiral Lewis winning out and the US test firing on Wednesday a nuclear capable Minuteman 3 ICBM able to reach Russia—which left President Putin with no choice but to order a massive tactical exercise with Yars mobile intercontinental ballistic missile systems of the Novosibirsk missile formation—nation destroying nuclear missiles that would, most certainly, put America out of its misery—and is a nation seemingly needing to be extinguished before it goes even more insane—insanity best displayed this week when the socialist Democrat Party controlled Tredyffrin-Easttown School District in Pennsylvania called the police on a 6-year-old girl child with Downs Syndrome named Margo Gaines who they claimed made a “gun” with her finger—the consequence of which now gives this 6-year-old girl a police record that will stain her record for life—a lifetime police record that most certainly won’t apply to criminal illegal aliens in America whom socialist Democrat Party House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is rushing to protect with a new law called H.R.5383 - New Way Forward Act—a roughly 4,400 word law designed to destroy this nation as it effectively abolishes all existing enforcement against illegal immigration—wipes clean the police records of all criminal aliens so they can’t be deported—decriminalizes illegal entry into America, even by those previously deported—says criminalizing illegal entry into America is “white supremacist”—and invents a new “right to come home” for hundreds-of-thousands of criminal aliens already deported which this law orders the American people to pay for—which makes it understandable why Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. is now comparing Pelosi with Satan. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

Nancy Pelosi and her Democrats place lifetime police record on 6-year-old girl child with Syndrome Margo Gaines (above right)…

…while making Forward law to obliterate the police records of all criminal aliens.

According to this report, while Russian nuclear missile forces at this very hour are preparing for total war, the vast majority of the American people remain oblivious to how close this catastrophe is nearing their homes and families—the latest reminder of this being so coming from Professor Rachel Bitecofer at Christopher Newport University in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia—who though being a radical socialist, made a “numerically close to perfect” prediction of the 2018 Midterm Elections months before it occurred saying that the Democrats would end up with a gain of 40 or 41 seats—they won 42.

The radical new theory Professor Bitecofer used to make her “close to perfect” prediction about the 2018 elections, this report explains, is based upon her highly disputed findings that “swing voters” no longer exist in America—called the “classic view” where about 55% of eligible voters are likely to go to the polls, and the winner is determined by the 15% or so of “swing voters” who flit between the parties—so a general election campaign amounts to a long effort to pull those voters in to your side—while in Bitecofer’s theory, when you boil it down, it says that modern American elections are rarely shaped by voters changing their minds, but rather by shifts in who decides to vote in the first place—predicated upon the belief that American politics has become like a bitter sports rivalry, in which the parties hang together mainly out of sheer hatred of the other team, rather than a shared sense of purpose—and if true, has Bitecofer’s model predicting that the Democrats are a near lock for the presidency in 2020, and are likely to gain US House seats and have a decent shot at retaking the US Senate—whereupon Russia would be left with no choice but to wage war against a socialist controlled United States—and as exactly like happened in 2016 when top President Putin advisor Vladimir Zhirinovsky warned the Americans “vote Trump or face nuclear war”.

Also little known among the masses of the American people, this report notes, is that at the core of socialist Democrat Party hatred is the “Triumph of Christianity in Russia” led by President Putin—a triumph that saw Russia becoming the leader of the global Christian right during the years of the socialist Obama-Clinton Regime—and during which, in 2014, saw former top President Ronald Reagan aide, and current President Trump confidant, Pat Buchannan proclaiming in his article “Whose Side Is God On Now?”:

With Marxism-Leninism a dead faith, Putin is saying the new ideological struggle is between a debauched West led by the and a traditionalist world would be proud to lead.

In the new war of beliefs, Putin is saying, it is that is on God's side. The West is .

The cornerstones placed down by President Putin to provide a firm foundation for Christianity to thrive in Russia, this report details, had as its centerpiece “Russia's Flat Tax Miracle”—which guaranteed to all Russian citizens and businesses fixed-in-law low tax rates that would remain constant and predictable—as opposed to socialist tax polices that rob people of their wealth while enriching the state—and were followed by Christian-based government laws, regulations and polices favoring families, morality, rights for unborn children and the protection of language, culture, religion and national borders.

Predictably, this report concludes, socialist Democrat Party forces in America fearing what was occurring in Russia as it returned to Christianity began attacking every nation following this path—such as Poland being attacked when it did so—as well as Hungary—just two of the multiple nations returning to their Christian roots these American socialists have branded as “nationalist”, “white supremacist” and “far right”—but in spite of over these past months, has seen Australia throwing these socialists from power, as well as the British people literally smashing their socialists into oblivion—the latter most important to note as these deranged socialist Democrats in America were actually planning on using the British socialist election model to defeat President Trump—which means that all they have left to oppose Trump is blind rage, hysteria and insanity—the same Trump who has given his citizens and businesses low and predictable tax rates they can plan their lives around—as well as his promoting government laws, regulations and polices to favor families, morality, rights for unborn children and protect his nation’s language, culture, religion and national borders—which in no way whatsoever makes him Russian or Russian-like—as all he’s doing is leading his people back to their Christian roots his socialist enemies are trying to dig up and destroy as fast as they can—but is an effort of socialist destruction of all things good spectacularly failing as evidenced by a new poll released yesterday who’s headline about says it all: “New High Of 90% Of Americans Satisfied With Personal Life”.

311,"Analyst and stock trader Gregory Mannarino says the market meltdown this week was caused by the Fed and weak economy. Mannarino says, “We understand there is a dynamic that has been changing here in the market with regard to the Fed’s purchasing mortgage-backed securities and bonds. This has rattled the emerging markets. They’re having problems with their currencies . . . The Federal Reserve has created an environment of distortions. By them pulling back some of this liquidity from the global economy, they’ve caused problems in these emerging markets, and this is being done on purpose.” What is the Fed trying to accomplish by destabilizing emerging market countries? Mannarino claims, “So, by rattling the emerging markets here, they are going to force investors into U.S. equities and into the U.S. bond market. It’s sort of a backdoor stimulus. . . . This just keeps the party going. That’s all this is.”

This may work in the short term, but it is not long term bullish for the markets. Mannarino warns, “We have this issue with the U.S. economy. They have been force feeding us nonsense . . . that we are in some kind of recovery. . . . This ISM number we got (Institute of Supply Management), we have not seen a pullback like this since 1980. It rattled the market. . . . We’re also getting mediocre earnings reports. We got unemployment numbers that are not good. So, this is spooking the market.” Looking at the big picture of the global economy, Mannarino goes on to say, “I am still a bull here in regards to the U.S. equity markets, but we all know where this is going. This is going to end terribly at some point. A complete financial meltdown is happening. You can see this already how the Federal Reserve has distorted this beyond the point of ridiculousness. Now, they are forcing the emerging market investor to look to the U.S. equity markets. At some point, people are going to see this whole thing is not sustainable. We are going to have a crisis of currency, a crisis of debt that is going to rock the core of the earth—period.”

This is a confidence game according to Mannarino. He says, “This is all about perception, not reality. If we were really in some type of a recovery, would we be talking about extending unemployment benefits for people? Would we be talking about more stimulus? Of course not, because there is no recovery. This is just smoke and mirrors across the board.” Don’t expect the market to plunge just yet because Mannarino says, “The Fed is counting on turmoil in the emerging markets to drive money into the U.S. market to keep the system propped up.”

Mannarino contends what you are seeing now is just a short term trade. In the longer term, Mannarino predicts, “Without a doubt, this is going to blow up. . . . I’ve been saying this for years now–we are headed for a pan global financial cataclysm. That’s a fact.” So, how does Mannarino plan to protect himself from this surefire coming calamity? Mannarino says, “I pull my gains out of the market, and I turn them into hard assets. I am the biggest precious metals bull out here. I can’t imagine a better place to be than in gold or silver, especially silver.”

958,"A conspiracy theorist’s YouTube video about how this ancient Greek grave marker depicts a laptop more than 2,000 years before personal computers were even a thing has resurfaced, and went viral

Currently on display at the J. Paul Getty Museum in California, the marble carving entitled “Grave Naiskos of an Enthroned Woman with an Attendant” has been dated to around 100 BC, and sourced possibly to Delos – a tiny island to the east of the Greek mainland with enormous mythological, cultural, and archaeological importance.

Stretching 94 cm high and more than 120 cm across, the carved funerary relief depicts a wealthy woman reclining on an armchair, reaching out to an object being offered up by a servant girl. “The depiction of the deceased reaching out for an item held by a servant has a long history in Greek funerary art and probably alludes to the hope of continuing earthly pleasures in the afterlife,” the Museum notes.

Legend has it that the Oracle of Delphi connected priests with super natural beings who passed along advanced technology and information.

And conspiracy theorists claim that is how a modern-day laptop ended up in a Greek sculpture from 100 BC.

But historians say the sculpture is just a deceased woman ‘touching the lid of a shallow chest’.

The official description of the laptop-like item is a “shallow chest”, and despite YouTuber StillSpeakingOut (he sure is) insisting that a tourist’s picture taken from a different angle shows that the object is too wide and narrow to be a jewelry box, US-based classical archaeologist Dorothy Lobel told Discovery News what we’re all thinking.

“The claim is ridiculous as it is clearly a box,” she says.

On its website, the museum describes the marble sculpture — called “Grave Naiskos of an Enthroned Woman with an Attendant” — as showing the woman reaching out “to touch the lid of a shallow chest.” So, no, the ancient figure is not reaching out for the latest Apple product. But that hasn’t stopped some from speculating about the object in question.

Another well-known classical archaeologist, Janet Burnett Grossman, told Discovery that the object is likely a flat box or a mirror, while others have suggested that it’s a wax writing tablet, which were used to record official documents at the time, such as birth certificates.

“If we look at other similar depictions in Greek art, we can see that a tablet – of the ancient variety, not the modern kind – looks a lot like a small laptop, and like the object in this grave marker,” Kristina Killgrove writes for Forbes. “Usually it is men who are depicted with a wax tablet, though, so why this wealthy woman?

There is also evidence of the goddess Athena being shown with a writing tablet and stylus, so the association between the wealthy deceased woman and Athena via a wax tablet makes some sense.”

Here’s a Roman scribe with his stylus and tablets on a tomb in Flavia Solva in Noricum.

But let’s assume this is a laptop, delivered by TARDIS or a plutonium-powered DeLorean to the ancient Greeks. We’ve got a few important questions:
• Why is a servant holding this laptop for the user? Shouldn’t it be on her … lap?
• Why is this woman holding the screen? Has the hinge gone bad?
• Why is this laptop so narrow? We know some people don’t like widescreen laptops, but this might be the narrowest aspect ratio we’ve ever seen.
• Why are the supposed USB ports circular, and the exact same size as circles seen in other broken statues?

Sadly, we’ll likely never know.

On its official Facebook page, the Getty Museum responds to the conspiracy theorists with humor. When one user writes, “This is what happens when time travelers don’t cover their tracks thoroughly enough. Learn from Doc Brown, people!” the museum responds, “So true, so true.”

A different user saw something entirely different in the statue, making it something of an archaeological Rorschach test: “Pizza box. And the pizza is stuck to the lid,” the user suggested.",conspiracy
1333,"The first scientific report from the flyby of the distant Kuiper belt object (KBO) Ultima Thule, shows two objects gently joined together in a cosmic kiss that is believed to be the process that formed planets like Earth.

Ultima Thule is a small, icy body resembling a red snowman flying through space more than a billion kilometres beyond Pluto. It is the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft, as the New Horizons probe zoomed past it last January 1. The encounter was the second flyby for the spacecraft, having passed close to Pluto in 2015.

The snowman appearance is quite appropriate because scientists believe it was formed by two two giant ice balls floating through space that stuck together the way you would stack a smaller snowball on top of a larger one to make the head and body of a snowman on Earth. This process of packing small objects together to make larger ones is thought to be the process that formed all the planets in our solar system, including Earth.

More than four billion years ago, when our sun was a newborn star, it was surrounded by an enormous, flat disk of gas, dust and debris known as the solar nebula. Within the cloud, collisions brought small bits together the way you grab handfuls of snow and pack them together to make a snowball. There was so much material in the cloud that the process made some objects grow larger and when they grew to about a kilometre in size, they developed gravity, which attracted more stuff from the cloud that fell onto their surfaces, adding even more to their growth. These planetesimals were the seeds that in some cases, cleared a path through the cloud, growing ever larger until they became full-fledged planets.

Closer in toward the sun, the ingredients of the primordial nebula were heavier materials such as metals and silicates, which gave us rocky planets like Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, while farther out, there was a higher proportion of gas and ices. Ultima Thule, along with Pluto, are on the outer fringes of the solar system, in a frozen region known as the Kuiper belt. Out there, the planet-building process did not proceed as far, which is one reason Pluto and its relatives are known as dwarf planets.

Usually, when objects in space collide, the speeds are so great they blow each other to bits. But occasionally, if they come together more slowly, and just kiss each other, they can stick together. Kisses have a way of doing that. The scientists are delighted to find that Ultima Thule is an object where that kiss actually happened.

Computer models reportedly show that the two lobes came together at a leisurely 8.9 km/h (5.5 mph) about half the speed of a bicycle, so they stuck without destroying each other. Fortunately for us, that's about as far as the process went, and Ultima Thule has remained in this embryonic stage ever since, giving us a glimpse into the very early process of planet formation. It's like seeing an image of yourself when you were still in the womb.

Scientists often try to look back in time to figure out how we got here, whether it be the process of planet formation or the evolution of life. Theories are developed, but until we see those processes in nature, there is a chance the theories could be wrong. That's why finding a fossil of life from the past, or in this case, a remnant of the process that formed our solar system is so important. They are windows into our deep past.

There is still more to learn from Ultima Thule as more data continues to stream down from the spacecraft. Then, the scientists hope that this remarkable New Horizons probe, no larger than a grand piano, which left Earth in 2006, and has already performed beyond expectations, will continue on to encounter another Kuiper belt object even farther out. Who knows what mysteries lie beyond?",mainstream
232,"Life in a distant future as imagined by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will be, in many ways, like life today. People will socialise, commute to work and have weekends to rest.

The only difference is that we will be living in huge spinning cylinders that closely mimic our planet, but are actually in orbit around it.

The world’s richest man, according to Forbes, is one of several prominent people who are thinking seriously about what humans might do if they ever have to develop habitats beyond Earth.

Mr Bezos’s vision is based on ideas first put forward in the 1970s by the Princeton scientist Gerard O’Neill. He proposed that humans could live in a set of twin cylinders, each measuring four miles in diameter and 16 miles in length. The cylinders counter-rotate so they keep facing the sun.

At a recent event for his space company Blue Origin, Mr Bezos suggested that a series of these colonies could be designed for specific uses: some residential, others for industry and leisure. He even proposed that some cylinders could have a lower gravitational pull so residents could “go flying with your own wings”.

The weather, he said, will be “like Maui on its best day, all year round”, referring to the picturesque Hawaiian island.

“Imagine what architecture would be like if it did not have to fulfil its primary purpose of shelter,” he told the event in Washington, DC, in May this year.

Mr Bezos is not the only person exploring the idea of living in space. As the effects of climate change become more apparent, governments, scientists and entrepreneurs across the world have started looking more seriously at concepts that were once considered more within the realm of science fiction.

“People have always shown they will do what is necessary to survive,” says Therese Griebel, deputy associate administrator for programmes at Nasa’s Space Technology Mission Directorate. “If the Earth becomes unsustainable, there will be a reason to go somewhere else.”

Other plans to live in space take various forms. Ms Griebel predicts humans could live sustainably on the moon by 2028, if Nasa can find a way for us to survive the freezing lunar night. SpaceX founder Elon Musk, meanwhile, prefers the longer-haul option of Mars.

The main challenge for any proposal is to find a way to extract resources from wherever humans choose to live. On the moon, this is likely to mean using the ice found recently at its poles and converting it into water, oxygen and hydrogen for fuel.

ISpace is just one of a handful of companies which thinks that such an opportunity could be turned into profit. The Japanese company says it has raised nearly $100m in its quest to get to the moon and start mining it. Its founder and chief executive, Takeshi Hakamada, says this will be the first step towards setting up a permanent colony there.

“The biggest hurdle to living in space is finding the resources needed to fuel your transportation needs,” says Mr Hakamada. “You need a lot of propellant, so mining the moon is the best way to get that.”

The company plans to land on the moon in 2021: Mr Hakamada predicts there will be a community of at least 1,000 people living and working there by 2040.

Mining the moon is also a crucial part of Mr Bezos’s plan. He has promised to sell $1bn worth of his stock in Amazon every year to help fund Blue Origin, which is planning to land on the moon by 2024.

Even among space enthusiasts, however, there is some scepticism that moon mining could ever work.

Al Globus, a former contractor at Nasa, is a proponent of O’Neill colonies, but believes the materials will have to come from Earth rather than another planetary body. “Mines fail on earth all the time,” he says. “I don’t think we are going to get it right on the moon, especially not first time.”

Some think that neither the moon nor purpose-built colonies will ever be big enough to house humanity should Earth’s resources run out. Mr Musk could counter this with his plan to fly humans to Mars in the next five years as the first step in the planet’s slow colonisation.

He says he can overcome Mars’ cold conditions by setting off nuclear explosions in its atmosphere — a plan he has referred to as “nuke Mars”.

Critics say these schemes are the idle fantasies of middle-aged men, which threaten to distract from attempts to solve climate change on Earth. Emily Cunningham, an Amazon employee, told Mr Bezos at the company’s annual shareholder meeting this year: “Our home planet Earth, not far-off places in space, desperately needs bold leadership.”

ISpace predicts it is likely to cost up to $10bn just to start producing fuel from the ice on the moon, making heavy government investment a necessity — something that seems unlikely given the more immediate domestic problems most developed countries are trying to solve.

Some involved in space research, however, predict that as early experimental missions start to yield results, public and governmental interest in interplanetary living will grow, giving it the impetus it needs.

Ms Griebel says: “Once you start building the infrastructure to extract resources from the moon, you will be able to sustain people for longer and longer. It becomes more real as you start to do it.”",mainstream
936,"They’re called the Flat Earthers (more like Flat Heads) and despite there being books, the internet and clever people who try to dissuade them, they insist it is a conspiracy theory to get more taxes out of us. They also think stars are holes in a big dome that covers the Earth, which is actually a disc.

Yes, I know it doesn’t make sense. No, I don’t understand it either. Yes, I am telling the truth. No, I don’t know what is wrong with them. Yes, people really are just that stupid.

Now, I love to entertain a conspiracy theory as much as the next girl. The flags on the Moon are waving around, but there should be zero gravity? Down with that!

The Badge Man on the Grassy Knoll was actually an FBI sniper? I’ll go along with it!

There really is a cure for cancer, but keeping people sick just makes too much money? OH YES, I’LL SIGN UP FOR THAT ONE. But this?

The Earth is flat? Just no.

Some conspiracy theories make perfect sense to me. Any time someone is murdered because they were getting too outspoken, or wanted to change the world (cough-cough, Malcolm X, cough-cough) or somebody is going to lose a lot of money, I’m inclined to believe it, and I think challenging the information we are given is important for humans.

Honestly, we need to feel that paranoia, we need to stay alert and not blindly believe the government has our best interests at heart, and when we disagree with the idiots in charge and get called conspiracy theorists, we suck it up because it can be a badge of honour. It CAN actually mean we are thinking for ourselves and might be on to something.

But now these Flat Heads are showing us all up. And you know who else is? Conspiracy theorists who go around saying Avril Lavigne and Beyoncé have been replaced by clones. I’m just going to leave that there. Because, well, no words.

So, keep them weird yes, but keep them dangerous, keep them controversial, keep them anti-government. Shut up about flat Earth and clones. Those kinds of conspiracy theories are a conspiracy theory against real conspiracy theories. Now I need to lie down.",mainstream
1271,"I was inspired to write this piece after taking out the trash this morning. Our canisters were filled with post-Christmas wrapping paper and dinner scraps. As I looked up at the sky en route to the curb, it was filled with contrails. Occasionally, I see Tweets about these clouds, and how they are being “used by the government to control the weather or even our minds.” Yep, seriously. Did this make the list of 5 weather or climate social media posts that need to disappear in 2020? Keep reading.

“The meteorologists are always wrong or just guessing.” I continue to harp on this point because it is so pervasive in social media. I am amazed at how many people actually believe this. It means my colleagues and I may not be doing a good job conveying the dramatic improvements in weather forecast over the past 50 years. From my perspective, there are several factors driving such statements:
• lack of understanding of probabilities (You would be surprised at how many people don’t understand what 20% chance of rain or the hurricane cone of uncertainty actually conveys);
• “wishcasting” or seeing desired outcomes in a forecast rather than what the data actually conveys (very common in snow forecasting);
• unrealistic expectations for pinpoint forecasts at their exact location when the science is not quite there yet; and
• the tendency to exhibit recency bias (remembering a recent “bad” forecast and overlooking the overwhelming number of good forecasts over the long haul).

For a deeper dive into this topic, my discussion in the Forbes article at this link is a good start

“It came without warning.” This is a staple for many people and media outlets after a bad storm or tornado. For example, I heard claims of “it came out of nowhere” after the horrific 2018 Duck Boat tragedy in Missouri. I plowed through language from the National Weather Service the day before that tragedy. Here is what the NWS Convective Outlook said on July 18th, 2018 for the region:

The potential for one or more early day thunderstorm clusters complicates the forecast scenario on Thursday. Any such cluster may present a localized severe wind risk early in the day, especially across portions of MO ... Further south down the Mississippi Valley, a more conditional severe risk will be present. Any early day thunderstorm cluster that survives may rejuvenate across portions of southern MO/northern AR during the afternoon. Later-day storms that initiate further north may also merge into a cluster that moves southeastward into this region. Some damaging wind risk would be possible in either scenario, with some marginal hail risk associated with any more discrete convection that may develop.

In 2019, it is rare that the potential for severe weather activity is going to be overlooked given the advances in short-range weather models, dual-polarization radar, and rapid-scan weather satellite imaging capabilities. I will concede that “out of nowhere” is a relative term. Though the possibility for severe weather or a tornado may have been warned for, if a person didn’t receive the information or chose to operate in a “business as usual” fashion, the appearance of a 60-mph gust of wind might seem sudden. This is where emerging social science research within atmospheric sciences is so important. We must understand how people consume weather information and why they make the decisions. For example, “Turn Around, Don’t Drown” is a cute little slogan, yet people still drive through flooded roadways. What risk assessment do they take (if any) before making that decision? For some people, the value proposition of not being late picking up a child at daycare may outweigh the risks because of optimism bias (the tendency to think a bad think won’t happen to them).

Meteorologist and social scientist Kim Klockow-McClain says that social science work is starting to pay dividends. Klockow-McClain, a research scientist at The University of Oklahoma Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies, gave a real-world example in an interview a few years ago. She pointed out a study in the Delaware River basin:

“It’s just a tropical storm.” I am hopeful that the weather enterprise continues to hammer home that category or rating may not fully represent potential impacts. Tropical Storm Imelda (2019) never became a hurricane but dumped almost 4 feet of rain on parts of Texas still recovering from Hurricane Harvey (2017). When Hurricane Michael (2018) was approaching the Florida panhandle, some people were hesitant to leave because it was “just” a certain category storm. Unfortunately, Michael rapidly intensified to a Category 5. Each hurricane is different so past experiences do not prepare you for the next storm. It is increasingly important that the public consume weather information from the standpoint of “risk potential” rather than simple a category or number. A new study, of which I am a co-author, was recently published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. It presents an intuitive metric for conveying rainfall hazards in hurricanes that may not be captured in the Saffir-Simpson scale.

“It’s snowing or cold outside so that means no global warming.” Yes, I used global warming. I don’t fall for the distracting tactic of saying “we changed the name to climate change.” I deal with that in a previous Forbes article at this link. To be honest, I am still amazed that people still Tweet or say things about cold weather refuting climate warming. Numerous articles and social media explanations, including by this author, have been written to explain why weather in a given day or week doesn’t refute or confirm climate change. Weather is your mood, and climate is your personality. Many of us use this little analogy to drive home the point, but my hunch is that Tweet and perspective will not go away any time soon. By the way, NASA climate scientist Gavin Schmidt, one of my favorite scientists to follow on Twitter, is projecting 2019 to finish as our 2nd warmest year on record. On December 17th, he tweeted:

“Earth always had hurricanes and extreme weather.” While this is a true statement, it really doesn’t mean anything within the context of a climate discussion. To me, that is like saying trees always fell in the forest or grass always grew naturally. Neither of those statements refutes that chainsaws can still cut a tree down or that fertilizer affects how grass grows on your lawn. Credible peer-reviewed articles, National Academy of Sciences reports, and virtually every professional society in weather-climate fields have noted that naturally-varying weather systems, including extreme events, are being affected by anthropogenic changes to our climate system. You may see “one-off” articles or studies disputing this statement, but I tend to stick with the larger body of evidence rather than confirmation bias. To be fair, there are exaggerated claims about extreme events on both sides of the ledger so consume your information carefully.

“The government is controlling the weather with chemtrails.” If you think that I am exaggerating this, ask a meteorologist. National Weather Service and TV meteorologist colleagues tell me they respond to calls, messages, and tweets about these clouds all of the time. You also might be surprised at how much pops up after a quick Google search for the word. The chemtrail conspiracy is the flat earth corner of atmospheric sciences. In reality, there is a very simple explanation rooted in basic science explained by the National Weather Service below:",mainstream
621,"Want to really get away from it all? The farthest you can travel from home (and still remain on Earth) is about 7,900 miles (12,700 kilometers) straight down, but you'll have to journey the long way round to get there: 12,450 miles (20,036 kilometers) over land and sea.

Why not take a shortcut, straight down? You can get there in about 42 minutes — that's short enough for a long lunch, assuming you can avoid Mole Men, prehistoric reptiles and underworld denizens en route. Granted, most Americans would end up in the Indian Ocean, but Chileans could dine out on authentic Chinese, and Kiwis could tuck into Spanish tapas for tea [sources: NOVA; Shegelski].

Of course, you'd be in for a rough ride. First, you'd have to pass through 22-44 miles (35-70 kilometers) of continental crust (3-6 miles/5-10 kilometers on the ocean floor) followed by 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mantle. After that, you'd have to traverse a Mars-sized outer core of liquid iron churning as hot as the sun's surface (10,000 degrees F, or 5,500 degrees C), then a solid, moon-sized inner core, and, some studies suggest, a liquid innermost core [sources: Angier; Locke; NOVA].

For sake of argument (and survival) let's pretend Earth is a cold, uniform, inert ball of rock. While we're at it, let's ignore air resistance.

At Earth's surface, gravity pulls on us at 32 feet (9.8 meters) per second squared. That means that, for each second you fall, you speed up by 32 feet per second — but only near Earth's surface. Gravity is a function of mass, and mass is a property of matter. On the surface, all of Earth's matter lies below your feet but, as you fall, more and more of it surrounds you, exerting its own gravity. These horizontal tugs counterbalance each other and cancel out, but the increasing proportion of mass above your head exerts a growing counterforce to the proportionately decreasing mass below, so your acceleration slows as you near the core. At the planet's center, your acceleration due to gravity is zero — Earth's mass surrounds you, gravity cancels out and you are weightless [sources: Locke; Singh].

You're still moving at a heck of a clip, though, so don't expect to stop there. Halfway to the center, your speed hits 15,000 mph (24,000 kph); 21 minutes after jumping in, you blow past the center at 18,000 mph (29,000 kph). Another 21 minutes later, with gravity slowing you as you go, you reach the far side and stop briefly in midair. Unless someone catches you, you'll then head back the way you came and start all over again. In our idealized case, this will continue indefinitely, like a pendulum or a spring, in a process called harmonic motion [sources: Plait; Shegelski; UCSB].

Of course, reality has a tendency to intrude on even the best thought experiments.",mainstream
60,"NEW YORK - YouTube says it's cracking down on conspiracy videos, though it's scant on the details.

Conspiracy videos abound on YouTube, whether it's about the Earth being flat or school shootings being staged. YouTube, its parent Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) are all facing challenges with the spread of misinformation, propaganda and fake news.

YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said at a conference Tuesday the company will include links to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia to try to debunk videos espousing conspiracy theories.

But Wikipedia itself has had its share of credibility issues, as the service lets anyone edit its content, whether that person is a pedigreed expert or an online troll. Though Wikipedia has tried to address that -- in part by restricting edits on high-profile or controversial pages -- it isn't immune from hoaxes and its own conspiracy theories.

In a statement Wednesday, YouTube said the links will include other ""third-party sources"" besides Wikipedia, though YouTube isn't identifying any. The organization that runs Wikipedia said Wednesday that it had no formal partnership with YouTube, but it welcomed the use of Wikipedia resources.

YouTube said the move is part of a broader initiative to crack down on misinformation, though it didn't give details on what else is in the works.

While conspiracy videos are nothing new on YouTube, the topic received renewed attention in recent weeks as videos falsely claimed that students speaking out about the Feb. 14 Florida school shooting, which killed 17 people, were ""crisis actors"" who were not really there when it happened.

One such conspiracy video was the top-trending video on YouTube until the company removed it -- although many similar videos remained up, illustrating the difficulty in instituting any sort of crackdown.

Conspiracy videos, to be sure, don't violate YouTube's policies. In the ""crisis actor"" case, the company said it removed the video because it violated its rules against harassment. Therefore, YouTube is unlikely to ban misinformation entirely. Instead, it may adopt Facebook's tactic of deemphasizing such content and making it less likely to be seen. As it stands, critics say YouTube is doing the opposite.

""What keeps people glued to YouTube? Its algorithm seems to have concluded that people are drawn to content that is more extreme than what they started with -- or to incendiary content in general,"" Zeynep Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies the social impact of technology, wrote in a recent New York Times essay.

Tufekci said as users click through video after video, excited by ""uncovering more secrets and deeper truths,"" YouTube leads us down ""a rabbit hole of extremism, while Google racks up the ad sales.""",mainstream
236,"WHY IS IT NOT BEING MADE NOW?— A related puzzle is the great amount of petroleum and coal in our world. It is generally acknowledged by experts that petroleum comes from ancient animals, and coal from ancient plants. Rapidly buried plant and animal life at some earlier time in earth’s history produced both petroleum and coal. But neither of them is being formed today . This is a great mystery to the scientists. Coal forms less than one percent of the sedimentary rock strata, yet it is of special significance to those seeking to understand the geologic record. The rock strata known as Carboniferous contains the most coal, but it is also found in other strata. Coal results when plant remains are compressed and heated by the weight of overlying sediments . Around the edges of coal seams is frequently seen the identifiable plants it came from. Enormous forests must have been rapidly buried in order to produce coal . The uniformitarian theory (called the autochthonous theory), held by evolutionists, teaches that coal has been regularly made for millions of years (even though it is admitted that it is not being made now). According to this theory, peat bogs were the source of the immense coal beds we now have. It is said that plants which compose the coal accumulated in large freshwater swamps or peat bogs during many thousands of years. But this theory does not square with the facts: (1) Much of the coal is obviously from types of plants and trees (such as the pine) which do not grow in swampy areas. (2) No coal is being made today in swamps. (3) No locality is known, anywhere in the world, where the bottoms of peat beds are forming typical coal beds. (4) Some coal seams are up to 30 or 40 feet [91-122 dm] [122 m] of plant remains for one seam , therefore some astounding conditions were required to produce all that coal! ""Though a peat-bog may serve to demonstrate how vegetal matter accumulates in considerable quantities, it is in no way comparable in extent to the great bodies of vegetation which must have given rise to our important coal seams . . No single bog or marsh [today] would supply sufficient peat to make a large coal seam.""—*E.S. Moore, Coal: Its Properties, Analysis, Classification, Geology, Extraction, Uses and Distribution (1940), p. 146.

The second theory is called the allochthonous theory , and suggests that coal strata accumulated from plants which had been rapidly transported and laid down during a massive flood that inundated entire continents and suddenly stripped them of their trees. Here is some evidence favoring this second view: (1) The immense quantity of vegetation that was buried to produce this coal. (2) The way that vegetation was so suddenly laid down and buried. (3) The fact that marine fossils such as fish, mollusks, and brachiopods are commonly found in coal .

""The small marine tubeworm Spirobis is commonly attached to plants in Carboniferous coals of Europe and North America. Since there is little anatomical evidence suggesting that coal plants were adapted to marine swamps, the occurrence of marine animals with nonmarine plants suggests mixing during transport, thus favoring the allochthonous model.""—Stuart E. Nevins, ""The Origin of Coal,"" in Up With Creation (1978), p. 241.

One doctoral thesis detailed how coal could have been rapidly formed as, under conditions imposed by a worldwide flood, floating mats of trees and vegetation sank, producing our present coal beds (S.A. Austin, ""Depositional Environment of the Kentucky No. 12 Coal Bed, et. al.,"" Geology Ph.D. dissertation, Pennsylvania State University, 1979). (4) [30.5-91.4 dm] or more in height, are often found in the strata associated with coal, or in the coal itself. The sediments forming the coal had to form rapidly in order to solidify before the tree trunks could rot and fall over .

""Figure 24 shows a tree that was buried to a depth of 4.6 m [15 ft]. Because the tree is in growth position and shows no root regeneration, it probably was buried very quickly, cetainly before it could decay.""—*R.C. Milici, et. al, ""The Mississippian and Pennsylvanian [Carboniferous] Systems in the United States: Tennessee,"" United States Geological Survey Professional Paper 111O-G32-4.

(6) The hollow trunks of trees in coal seams will be filled with material not native to the coal—showing that the trees or the coal were carried there from somewhere else . (8) Coal is found in layers, called cyclothem. Between each layer of coal will be some washed-in material: sandstone, shale, limestone, clay, etc.

(9) Under and over the coal seams is frequently found underclays which are not natural soil for swamps or forests. In addition, there is an absence of the necessary soil for the luxuriant vegetation which turned to coal. It is clear that the clay was washed in, then the vegetation, and then more clay. (11) Lastly, analysis of the structure of coal itself reveals particle orientation, sorted texture, and microlamination,—all of which indicate transportation to the site rather than growth-in-place. Coal and petroleum are only found in sedimentary strata . Fossils are only found in sedimentary strata. All the evidence for a careful study of coal points to a worldwide Flood as the event that laid down those strata! (12) Both petroleum and coal can be made in a comparatively short period of time . Research scientists find that it is not difficult to make, and could be made by nature just as quickly. The key is immense pressure.

""Sedgwick was the first to describe the fossils of the lower Graywacke Strata, which he named the Cambrian system, after an ancient name for Wales. Eventually their studies led them to different levels of the Graywacke, where the mercurial and territorial Murchison claimed much of Sedgwick’s domain for his newly founded Silurian system. ""Inevitably, almost all of the members of the Geological Society were drawn into the fray, and, when another geologist of the time, Sir Henry Thomas de la Boche, claimed part of the Graywacke for his Devonian period, the battle lines were drawn. For nearly a decade the Great Devonian Controversy, as it was called, raged on in the scientific journals. The political maneuvering behind the scenes was almost as convoluted as the Graywacke itself.""—*R. Milner, Encyclopedia of Evolution (1990), p. 401.

""If we insist on maintaining and supporting the theory of evolution, we are then forced to eliminate and disavow mathematical probability concepts. If we are convinced that mathematics is correct, then we have to discard the present concepts of evolution. The two teachings do not seem to be compatible with each other. ""As objective scientists, which shall we support? ""Remember the story of the Emperor’s New Clothes? Not a single vassal dared point out the obvious fact that the emperor was naked; instead they competed with each other to vociferously praise the wonderful tailoring of the new suit. They even described in detail the fine and exquisite stitching to be found in the lower left corner of the imaginary coat. They were all gratified—to their own satisfaction—to hear themselves describe the virtue and beauty of the coat. ""It was left to the simplistic mind of a naive child to exclaim: ‘but this is not so—the Emperor is naked!’ "" ""Does this sound familiar? History has a way of repeating itself.""—I.L. Cohen, Darwin Was Wrong—A Study in Probabilities (1984), pp. 217-218. ""It is indeed, a very curious state of affairs, I think, that paleontologists have been insisting that their record is consistent with slow, steady, gradual evolution where I think that privately, they’ve known for over a hundred years that such is not the case. I view stasis and the trumpeting of stasis to the whole world that the fossil record shows slow, steady, continuous change (as opposed to jerky patterns of change) as akin to the ‘Emperor’s new clothes.’ Paleontologists have known this for over a hundred years.""—*Norman Eldredge, ""Did Darwin Get it Wrong?""

1330,"The Flat Earth model is a conspiracy theory surrounding the concept that the Earth is a flat, disc-shaped plane, surrounded by ice. Many ancient cultures subscribed to the idea but it was made famous again in modern times thanks to the creation of a Flat Earth society by Samuel Shenton in 1956. Mark Sargent, an avid member of the club and author of several books on the topic, revealed one reason why he believes it is more than just a conspiracy.

Speaking during Netflix documentary “Behind the Curve”, Mr Sargant claimed his theory was superior to everything NASA has told us for years. Taking the production crew to a beach near his home, Mr Sargant pointed at the city of Seattle across the water. He said in 2018: “Here’s an example if you want to see it real quick. “So like the buildings in the distance – right out there – that is Seattle.

“You should not be able to see it. “There should be hundreds of feet of curvature between us and them.” Mr Sargant went on to dismiss any scientific reasoning for the revelation, before claiming the Flat Earth theory answers all the questions. He added: “You can say it’s refraction, or it’s atmospheric effects, no – not in every weather condition, not in every light condition. “This is why science is having a problem combating what we are doing.

“Neil deGrasse Tyson says it’s a growing anti-intellectual movement which borders on the end of civilisation as we know it. “But the reason why we’re winning versus science, is science just throws back maths. Neil deGrasse Tyson is an American astrophysicist author and leading science figure.

He has been a long time supporter of NASA, claiming the space agency deserves more funding and backing by the general public. In March 2012, he testified before the United States Senate Science Committee, stating: ""Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. ""For twice that – a penny on a dollar – we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th-century birthright to dream of tomorrow.""

This screen image released by Dictionary.com shows an entry for the word misinformation, which Dictionary.com announced as its 2018 Word of the Year. (Dictionary.com via AP)

NEW YORK (AP) — Misinformation, as opposed to disinformation, was chosen Monday as Dictionary.com’s word of the year on the tattered coattails of “toxic,” picked earlier this month for the same honor by Oxford Dictionaries in these tumultuous times.

Jane Solomon, a linguist-in-residence at Dictionary, said in a recent interview that her site’s choice of “mis” over “dis” was deliberate, intended to serve as a “call to action” to be vigilant in the battle against fake news, flat earthers and anti-vaxxers, among other conduits.

It’s the idea of intent, whether to inadvertently mislead or to do it on purpose, that the Oakland, California-based company wanted to highlight. The company decided it would go high when others have spent much of 2018 going low.

“The rampant spread of misinformation is really providing new challenges for navigating life in 2018,” Solomon told The Associated Press ahead of the word of the year announcement. “Misinformation has been around for a long time, but over the last decade or so the rise of social media has really, really changed how information is shared. We believe that understanding the concept of misinformation is vital to identifying misinformation as we encounter it in the wild, and that could ultimately help curb its impact.”

In studying lookups on the site that trended this year, Dictionary noticed “our relationship with truth is something that came up again and again,” she said.

For example, the word “mainstream” popped up a lot, spiking in January as the term “mainstream media,” or MSM, grew to gargantuan proportions, wielded as an insult by some on the political right. Other words swirling around the same problem included a lookup surge in February for “white lie” after Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, admitted to telling a few for President Donald Trump.

The word “Orwellian” surfaced in heavy lookups in May, after a statement attributed to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders accused the Chinese government of “Orwellian nonsense” in trying to impose its views on American citizens and private companies when it declared that United Airlines, American Airlines and other foreign carriers should refer to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as part of China in public-facing materials, such as their websites.

Misinformation, Solomon said, “frames what we’ve all been through in the last 12 months.” In that vein, the site with 90 million monthly users has busied itself adding new word entries for “filter bubble,” ″fake news,” ″post-fact,” ″post-truth” and “homophily,” among others. Other word entries on the site have been freshened to reflect timely new meanings, including “echo chamber.”

The company’s runners-up for the top honor include “representation,” driven by the popularity of the movies “Black Panther” and “Crazy Rich Asians,” along with wins during the U.S. midterm elections for Muslim women, Native Americans and LGBTQ candidates.

But the rise of misinformation, Solomon said, stretches well beyond U.S. borders and Facebook’s role in disseminating fake news and propaganda in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The use of Facebook and other social media to incite violence and conflict was documented around the globe in 2018, she said.

“Hate speech and rumors posted to Facebook facilitated violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, riots started in Sri Lanka after false news set the country’s Buddhist majority against Muslims, and false rumors about child kidnappers on WhatsApp led to mob violence in India,” Solomon said.

Is disinformation or misinformation at play in terms of the year’s most prominent conspiracy theories? Solomon noted proliferation on social media over students in the Parkland school shooting being crisis actors instead of victims of violence, and over a group of migrants from Honduras who are making their way north being funded by “rich liberals.”

Elsewhere in the culture, countless podcasts and videos have spread the absurd notion of a global cover-up that the Earth is flat rather than round. The idea of “misinfodemics” has surfaced in the last several years to identify the anti-vaccination movement and other beliefs that lead to real-world health crises, Solomon said.

There are distinctions between misinformation and disinformation to be emphasized.

“Disinformation would have also been a really, really interesting word of the year this year, but our choice of misinformation was very intentional,” she said. “Disinformation is a word that kind of looks externally to examine the behavior of others. It’s sort of like pointing at behavior and saying, ‘THIS is disinformation.’ With misinformation, there is still some of that pointing, but also it can look more internally to help us evaluate our own behavior, which is really, really important in the fight against misinformation. It’s a word of self-reflection, and in that it can be a call to action. You can still be a good person with no nefarious agenda and still spread misinformation.”

She pointed to “Poe’s law” in slicing and dicing “misinfo” and “disinfo.” The term, dating to 2005, has become an internet shorthand to sum up how easy it is to spread satire as truth online when an author’s intent isn’t clearly indicated.

The phrase is based on a comment one Nathan Poe posted on a Christian forum during a discussion over creationism, in which he commented: “Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is uttrerly (sic) impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone (italics used) won’t mistake for the genuine article.”

1213,"Glenn Greenwald, a journalist, constitutional lawyer, commentator, and author of three New York Times best-selling books on politics and law, has been working with NBC News in publishing a series of articles on how covert government agents infiltrate the Internet to “manipulate, deceive, and destroy reputations.”

The information is based on documents leaked by National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden. Greenwald’s article, How Covert Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive, and Destroy Reputations, is based on four classified documents produced by the British spy agency GCHQ, and presented to the NSA and three other English speaking agencies reportedly part of “The Five Eyes Alliance.”

In this shocking piece, Greenwald publishes a copy of a spy training manual used entitled: “The Art of Deception: Training for Online Covert Operations.” Greenwald writes that agencies like the NSA are “attempting to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse, and in doing so, are compromising the integrity of the internet itself.” Greenwald writes:
• None Internet trolls are not who I thought — they’re even scarier

While this kind of counter-intelligence activity may not sound surprising given the objectives of spy agencies going after terrorists, what disturbs Greenwald (and many others) is that the discussion regarding these techniques have been greatly expanded to include the general public:

The title page of one of these documents reflects the agency’s own awareness that it is “pushing the boundaries” by using “cyber offensive” techniques against people who have nothing to do with terrorism or national security threats, and indeed, centrally involves law enforcement agents who investigate ordinary crimes.

No matter your views on Anonymous, “hacktivists” or garden-variety criminals, it is not difficult to see how dangerous it is to have secret government agencies being able to target any individuals they want – who have never been charged with, let alone convicted of, any crimes – with these sorts of online, deception-based tactics of reputation destruction and disruption.

And while these leaked documents concern the British spy agency, Greenwald is quick to point out that the Obama administration has actually been open and forward about using such techniques in the U.S.:

Sunstein also proposed sending covert agents into “chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups” which spread what he views as false and damaging “conspiracy theories” about the government. Ironically, the very same Sunstein was recently named by Obama to serve as a member of the NSA review panel created by the White House, one that – while disputing key NSA claims – proceeded to propose many cosmetic reforms to the agency’s powers (most of which were ignored by the President who appointed them).

Trolls Used by Big Pharma to Attack Vaccine Objectors

Have you ever been on an Internet forum, blog, or Facebook Page where all of a sudden, out of nowhere, several people appear to contradict the main topic being discussed, especially if it is regarding a controversial topic like vaccines? Well it is entirely possible, and even likely, that it is not coincidence, and that it is a well-coordinated attack by “trolls”. As Greenwald reveals in his recently published article, there are definitely programs in place in government spy agencies to do just that.

This tactic of trained trolls can be used by those outside of government also, and Big Pharma seems to be one business sector that employs this tactic as well, especially targeting publishers who report on the dangers of vaccines.

Of course it should also be pointed out that the distinction between the government and the pharmaceutical industry is a very hazy one. As we have pointed out several times in the past, the vaccine industry cannot survive in a free market, but needs the government to prop them up. In the 1980s there were so many lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies for vaccine damages, that the vaccine industry blackmailed Congress by threatening to get out of the vaccine business unless they passed legislation protecting them from lawsuits. Congress obliged, and legislation was passed preventing the public from suing pharmaceutical companies for damages due to vaccines, and this law was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2011. The pharmaceutical industry now has a free pass to put as many vaccines into the market place as they want to, regardless of efficacy or dangerous side effects, since there is no accountability left in the judicial system.
• None Groundbreaking Study Exposing Vaccine Dangers Gets Censored Off The Internet

Today, the pharmaceutical industry is practically a branch of the government. The government awards grants from your tax dollars to research new vaccines, the FDA approves them, and then government organizations like the CDC and UNICEF purchase the vaccines with your tax dollars. The CDC even holds patents and earns royalties on vaccines, and many of the top scientists work for both the government and the pharmaceutical companies. Julie Gerberding, for example, was the head of the CDC from 2002 to 2009, and then took over as head of the pharmaceutical company Merck’s vaccine division overseeing billions of dollars in sales. The government definitely has a vested interest in protecting the vaccine market.

So it should surprise no one that there are coordinated efforts to infiltrate and discredit those who publish the truth about vaccines, which may lead to fewer people wanting to purchase or receive them.

Consider the following comments appearing on a blog post from a pro-Pharma site discussing how to target sites and Facebook Pages who publish the alternative view of vaccines. Advice is given on how to infiltrate and flood discussions about vaccines by pretending to be victims of diseases because they failed to get vaccinated. I am not going to mention the name of the website and give them publicity, but it has already been established that this site is financed by those with clear ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Here are some comments that appeared in a blog post that was trying to convince readers that outbreaks of diseases were due to “anti-vaccinationists”:

Use emotional warfare on anti-vax blogs. Tell emotional stories full of tears and sobbing and unbearable grief and terror, about people in your own family or people you read about, who were sick with or died of terrible diseases. Don’t hold back details about bodily fluids and suchlike: the more gross the better. This stuff has a way of infiltrating the minds of readers and subtly influencing their decisions, in a manner similar to advertising.’ ‘Go in there and “agree with them” and then say things that appear thoroughly delusional, overtly nuts, blatantly and obviously wrong even to nincompoops, etc. Occasional spelling and grammar errors are also useful but don’t over-do. The point of this exercise is to create an impression that drives away undecideds who may come in to check out these sites. It helps to do this as a group effort and begin gradually, so the sites appear to be “going downhill slowly.”‘ ‘But it is useful to have an email address that can’t be traced back, for certain legitimate and ethical uses, just as it is useful to have a mail box at say the UPS store.’
• None Parents seeking online, non-medical help for autism being reported to CPS

As you can see from this advice, trying to reason or debate on the merits or lack of merits regarding vaccines does not work, so they have to resort to manipulative and deceptive tactics, much the same as what Greenwald was reporting about above in regards to government spy agencies. Here is a comment showing how they also try to outnumber those who are not trolls:

These trolls are also adept in creating fake personalities with fake email addresses so that they can continue to infiltrate those who publish the other side of the vaccine debate:

76: The way to do it is to set up a fictitious email address. Speaking from experience working on research on extremist groups: Start by setting one up on your existing broadband provider: AT&T, Comcast, and the rest of ’em give you five or more email addresses of your choice. Create a totally fictitious name and then an address that reflects that name e.g. John Doe and [email protected] Next, get an address on a free service provider such as Yahoo or Hotmail or whatever. Since most of these ask for your “other” email address as proof of identity, give them the one on your broadband provider. They will send a confirmation email to that address giving you your starting password. Third, after about a week of using your new fictitious address in various places that let you sign up for comments, you can be sure it’s working, so then go in and delete the address you created on your broadband service. Typically they deactivate the address immediately and then take a month to free up that slot for re-use. This step ensures that your Yahoo or Hotmail address becomes un-traceable back to your broadband provider. Fourth, wait a month for the original fictitious name to completely purge from your broadband provider. Fifth: Now you’re home free to get onto the anti-vax boards and any other objectionable boards you want to go after, and make all manner of noise to make them look ridiculous and drive away the undecideds. Yeee-hawww, round ’em up! Speaking of rounding ’em up, you now have an untraceable email address … That said, the option of simply going forth and making noise on anti-vax boards makes it all worthwhile. Every undecided you scare away from those boards, is one more family that will probably get their kids vaccinated.

The “CENSORSHIP” Accusation: Don’t fall for it

Trolls and Internet dissenters love to level the accusation of “CENSORSHIP!” as soon as they are restricted from carrying out their often highly orchestrated opposition to information they would love to suppress from being propagated on the Internet. Don’t fall for this ploy.

First, there is a huge difference between “moderating” and “censorship.” A blog or Facebook Page that allows for interaction of opposing viewpoints, for example, may still moderate the discussion and prevent trolling. As we have shown above, manipulative deception is common on the Internet, and allowing this kind of activity in one’s own private space is actually allowing the opposing view to get away with their own form of “censorship” by means of deception.

Secondly, “censorship” is a neutral term, not a negative one. 100% uncensored speech is both dangerous and illegal. You can be prosecuted in a court of law for many forms of speech, such as slander, child pornography, threats of intent to harm, and many others.

I am always amused when moderating Internet discussions on content owned by myself or others we are publishing, and having to delete comments that are either derogatory, offensive, or anything else opposing the purpose of our communication, that we are accused of “censorship” as if we are the ones doing something wrong for suppressing such speech. There seems to be a misguided assumption that anything published on the Internet is owned by the public. Businesses, especially, fall for this common misconception all the time, by allowing unmoderated discussions to occur on their own Internet content.

But back when there was only print media, everything that was sent into a media source was censored and filtered, with only the opinions judged by the editors to be worthy of publishing to their readers being accepted and printed. And if businesses published information about their products, they certainly did not allow competitors and adversaries to come into their place of business to attack them and voice their opinions! And if they purchased advertising space in any media, either print, radio, or TV, the voices of those who did not like it were certainly not heard in the advertising space of media it was appearing in. They had to purchase their own space, or try to get a “letter to the editor” published.
• None 11 people who blew the whistle on information that was once considered a “conspiracy theory”

Yet, when you publish something on the Internet, you own that content! If it is a blog, you can either turn off comments altogether, or you can allow certain comments to be published, according to any standards you see fit!

As far as social media, the social media company might provide the platform, but you still own the content. You are under no obligation to allow trolls and others to voice their contrary opinions on your content just because it is published on the Internet. People are free to publish their own content in their own space – they have no right to do it in yours.

Of course the owner of the social media platform might engage in their own form of censorship or restrictions, but that is a topic of another article to follow. For now, if you are a publisher of content on the Internet today (as almost everyone is), just be aware that as you grow in popularity, you may very well start attracting trolls trying to discredit you or your message.

425,"In his annotations to Commentary on the Armillary Sphere (Hun Tian Yi Zhu) Zhang Heng (78–139) explained the Celestial Sphere theory, commenting “heaven is like an egg and the earth is like the yolk of the egg.” On the basis of this remark, many people have argued that Zhang Heng already realized that the earth is spherical. For the convenience of discussion, we call this view ‘Zhang’s theory of a spherical earth.’ After systematically analyzing the relevant literature, Tang Ruchuan pointed out in 1962 that this “theory of a spherical earth” is only a superficial “false appearance” and the Celestial Sphere theory actually refers to a spherical heaven and a flat earth.1 Zheng Wenguang argued that the cosmic model of the Celestial Sphere theory is a hollow heavenly ball, half-filled with water on which the spherical earth floats.2 He regards the theory of Huang Renyu of the Ming dynasty, who compared “the shape of heaven and earth” to a “pig bladder” half of which is “full of water” with “a big dry soil pellet” within it as a “theory of a spherical earth,” It’s worth noting that Zheng Wenguang’s viewpoint has become pervasive among historians of science.

471,"From their position on the International Space Station , astronauts are treated to a unique view of our planet that most people will never have the chance to see.

The ISS orbits Earth at a height of around 250 miles, meaning the space station makes around 16 trips around Earth every single day.

Now, one NASA astronaut on board the ISS has snapped several stunning photos of our planet, showing the ‘ever-changing skyline’ on the space station.

Jessica Meir tweeted the photos, writing: “The first orientation may make more sense to you, but to me this is the ever-changing skyline on @Space_Station (photo 3). Perspective.

While the Earth is clearly round in the photos, several sceptical viewers aren’t convinced, with many still claiming that our planet is flat.

One user replied: “Nice try with the fish eye, but it’s flat,” while another added: “That’s fish eye lens. Make Earth looks like round. Actually, the earth is flat!”

And one questioned: “So from 400km above the earth you can view the whole round earth? Yeah very believable.”

While these conspiracy theorists are convinced that the Earth is flat, humans have actually known that Earth is round for more than 2,000 years.

NASA explained: “The ancient Greeks measured shadows during summer solstice and also calculated Earth's circumference. They used positions of stars and constellations to estimate distances on Earth.

“They could even see the planet's round shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse. (We still can see this during lunar eclipses.)”

Today, scientists can use GPS and other satellites to measure Earth’s size and shape to within a centimetre!

NASA added: “Even though our planet is a sphere, it is not a perfect sphere. Because of the force caused when Earth rotates, the North and South Poles are slightly flat.

“Earth's rotation, wobbly motion and other forces are making the planet change shape very slowly, but it is still round.”",mainstream

He announced: “We are a professional football club in the Spanish fourth tier and we are born to unite the voices of millions of flat earth movement followers and all those people who are looking for answers.

594,"Wilbur Glenn Voliva (March 10, 1870 – October 11, 1942[1]) was an evangelist and a prominent proponent of Flat Earth theories.

Voliva was born on a farm in Indiana on Mar. 10, 1870. In 1889, he entered Union Christian College, Merom Indiana; he graduated five years later and became a minister. In 1898 he was drawn to the teachings of John Alexander Dowie and eventually joined his congregation, becoming an elder of the Christian Catholic Church of Zion, Illinois. In 1901 he emigrated to Australia to become overseer-in-charge of the Australian branch.

In September 1905, Dowie suffered a stroke and recuperated in Jamaica, claiming $2,000 a month expenses from the investments, and asked Voliva to return to oversee the city in his absence.[2] Voliva arrived in February 1906, whereupon the congregation revolted against Dowie's leadership, accusing him of corruption and polygamy, and elected Voliva as head of the church, which he then renamed to the ""Christian Catholic Apostolic Church."" By careful management he rescued Zion from bankruptcy, gaining the support of the church members. He kept tight control on his some 6,000 followers, which made up the community, even up to the point of dictating their choice of marriage partners. The city of Zion was effectively controlled by the church; all of its real estate, while sold at market rates, was conveyed under a 1,100 year lease, subject to many restrictions and to termination at the whim of the General Overseer. Religions other than the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church were effectively banned – visiting preachers from rival sects were harassed and hounded out of town by the city police force.

Voliva diversified Zion Industries, an industrial concern owned by the church that manufactured Scottish lace, to include a bakery which produced the popular Zion brand fig bar cookies and White Dove chocolates. Zion was a one-company town and its workers were paid substandard wages.

Voliva introduced many new rules for members and notices were placed around the town with stern warnings that the independents (who didn't belong to the church) resented and often burned. But the city was established as a safe space for those within its boundaries.[3]

From 1914, Voliva gained nationwide notoriety by his vigorous advocacy of the flat earth doctrine. He offered a widely publicized $5000 challenge for anyone to disprove the flat earth theory.[4] The church schools in Zion taught the flat earth doctrine. In 1923 Voliva became the first evangelical preacher in the world to own his own radio station, WCBD, which could be heard as far away as Central America.[5] His radio station broadcast his diatribes against round earth astronomy, and the evils of evolution. He was quoted about the sun as follows:

The idea of a sun millions of miles in diameter and 91,000,000 miles away is silly. The sun is only 32 miles across and not more than 3,000 miles from the earth. It stands to reason it must be so. God made the sun to light the earth, and therefore must have placed it close to the task it was designed to do. What would you think of a man who built a house in Zion and put the lamp to light it in Kenosha, Wisconsin?[4]

He became increasingly focused on destroying the 'trinity of evils': modern astronomy, evolution and higher criticism, insisting on a strict interpretation of 24-hour days for creation and travelling to Dayton, Tennessee, to appear as a witness at the Scopes trial (he wasn't called).[6] Voliva also predicted the end of the world would come in 1923, 1927, 1930, 1934[7] and 1935.[4]

Like his predecessor, Voliva increasingly developed an overtly lavish lifestyle, amassing a $5m personal fortune by 1927, which began to alienate his followers, especially after the hardships brought on by the Great Depression, which forced Zion Industries into bankruptcy. In 1935 Voliva tried to revive the flagging fortunes of the church by instituting the annual Zion Passion Play, along the lines of the famous one in Oberammergau. However, in 1937, a disgruntled employee set ablaze the church's huge Shiloh Tabernacle, where the play took place. Shortly thereafter, Voliva was forced into personal bankruptcy and he was reduced to being the honorary president of Zion Industries. The governance of the city reverted to the independents and the new authorities selected a globe for the compulsory car sticker that Voliva was forced to put on his car.[8] He spent most of his time in Florida where he hoped to establish another fundamentalist colony, but in 1942 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Voliva made a tearful public confession to his followers that he had misappropriated church funds for his personal use and committed other misdeeds. He died shortly thereafter on October 11, 1942 (though he had previously stated that he would live to 120 due to his diet of Brazil nuts and buttermilk[1][4]), and the church all but dissolved. A small remnant was reorganized under the leadership of Michael Mintern. It was later renamed to ""Christ Community Church.""

That she will appears to be taken for granted in some quarters, usually by professional women who do not see that their career can be identified in any way with their husband's. But as Lord Hoffmann discovered last week, what your spouse does for a living can affect public perceptions.

Leaving that aside for a minute, let's assume that Hillary wants to run, and that the Democratic Party would have her - a pretty big leap to make, but never mind. Even if Monicagate could be brushed aside, the campaign would run slap into the Whitewater affair, in which the First Lady is very much implicated in her own right. The thought of that horror being revived is enough to give any Democrat nightmares.

Women are not to dress in men's clothes, or in ""provocative"" outfits, while men are warned against ""hippy"" attire.

Few corners of Greek culture are left uncondemned. Football supporters are prohibited from ""fanatical behaviour"" at matches, nightclubbers should steer clear of sinful dances and people should not damage their health by smoking.

Yesterday, rapper B.o.B. tweeted out several items indicating support for the idea that the Earth is flat. In response, astrophysicist and science popularizer Neil deGrasse Tyson issued a few fact-checks of B.o.B.'s tweets, refuting them as thoroughly as Alexander Hamilton refuted Samuel Seabury. For example:

The rapper replied today with a rap track against Tyson called 'Flatline'. In the interest of scientific accuracy, here's the lyrics to 'Flatline', annotated to comment on its scientific content. (And a few other items as well.)

This seems unlikely.

While free thinking – allowing yourself to consider ideas that are not part of a mainstream consensus – is an admirable quality, it’s equally important to be critical in your thinking.

Fun science fact: Pigs don’t sweat very much – they don’t have many sweat glands and those glands aren’t that useful for temperature regulation. So they cool off by rolling in mud or cool water.

Tyson wears pretty well-fitted vests, no loosening needed. For example:

Rechargable batteries lose their ability to hold a charge over time, due to a buildup of litium on the anode of the battery, according to research performed at Ohio State University that was published in 2012.

Definitely a good idea – as rap and hip-hop lyrics have been demonstrated to improve critical thinking skills among students - a big topic in education research.

“Common sense” – at least, everyday observation and reasoning - is actually what led to the development of the idea that the Earth is round. People have noted since millennia before the birth of Christ that, for example, sailboats move vertically as they disappear from the horizon, rather than merely getting smaller as you’d expect from a flat Earth.

NASA is not part of the Department of Defense, and its Administrator reports directly to the President. There is a lot of overlap and cooperation between the two, though. Many astronauts were ex-military, and the DOD and NASA occasionally collaborate on space-related projects.

Freemasonry’s practices date back – at earliest – to 1390, and in its modern form dates back, at earliest, to around 1717 with the assembly of the four lodges at St. Paul’s Churchyard. Freemason’s Constitution was written in 1723. The earliest records of a spherical Earth date back to the Pythagorean school of the 5th century BCE, over 2,000 years earlier, making the Freemasons unlikely originators of the idea of a spherical Earth.

The geographer Strabo in the first century suggested that lines in the Odyssey make it clear that seafarers in the Homeric age knew the Earth was round, which would place knowledge of a spherical Earth even earlier in history.

Human beings are remarkably genetically similar compared to other species. They have lower genetic diversity than chimpanzees, plants and bacteria, and greater genetic diversity exists between human individuals than human groups.

In sociology, the term cult was intended to refer to small religious groups that center around the veneration of a particular person, object or practice. They tend to be led by charismatic leaders and tend to either be focused on “new” or “lost” religious ideologies. Cults can, over time, lose some of these characteristics and be better classified as denominations or churches. But this type of religious typology has a number of critics as well.

That said, science, as a profession or practice, doesn’t fit any sociological definition of “cult.”

Heliocentrism would pretty much put the nail in the coffin for any Flat Earth theory. It is, however, very well established. Heliocentrism came into vogue as more advanced instruments were available to observe the planets, and geocentric models were increasingly unable to account for those motions. One of the the biggest nails in the geocentric coffin was Kepler's discovery of elliptical orbits, which predicted the position of the planets much more accurately than any geocentric model.

Given B.o.B.’s previous advice to keep shooters in the game, science proponents would be unwise to take Neil deGrasse Tyson off the court.

No President of the United States has regularly worn a kippah, as no practicing Jew has been elected to the office. That said, our first President, George Washington penned some lovely words to a Jewish congregation in Rhode Island, which was published in several newspapers.

""It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it was the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights,"" Washington wrote. ""For happily, the government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.""

Doctor Richard Sauder’s work, at least as available on his blog, does not appear to be very rigorously scientific.

The rhyme “flat line” / “blood line” is difficult to classify. (Check out a list of rhyme types here.) At first glance, it’s an identical rhyme – using the same word twice. But an identical rhyme uses the same word in ""sound and sense"" - so does this count? ""Line"" in the sense of a flat Earth would be a geometric line, whereas in ""blood line,"" the line in question is a genealogical line, which is a different meaning of the word. So ""identical rhyme"" doesn't seem to be the right classification. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

These metaphors by Dr. Tyson are generally accurate.

706,"In this paper, the diffraction by a half‐sheet parallel to a flat earth for H‐ and E‐polarized plane waves are discussed. The half‐sheet is assumed to be perfectly conducting, and the flat earth is an imperfectly conducting dielectric with the complex refractive index n . This problem is solved by using the angular spectrum proposed by Clemmow, which may be also solved by using the Wiener‐Hopf technique. When kd is large, the diffraction fields can be approximated by the geometrical rays even for small r except in the neighborhood of θ = π/2 and 3π/2. Here, r and θ are polar coordinates of the observation point, with the origin as the edge, and d is the distance between the half‐sheet and the flat earth. The far field can be approximated by the simple geometrical rays in all regions (0 < θ < π). The interaction between the edge and the flat earth can be evaluated even for small kd . Exact values by the numerical integration show that these approximate solutions can give very good accuracy even for small r except in the neighborhood of θ = π/2 and 3π/2. These results will give a fundamental concept to the understanding of the diffraction by a finite conducting plane over a flat earth.",mainstream

The funked-out diva has collaborated with a roster of impressive hip-hop artists in the past, including the late Ol’ Dirty Bastard, OutKast, the Neptunes and her hubbie, Nas. But when she was searching for talent for her new single, “Bossy,” she wanted to reach into the annals of West Coast rap.

“I did the record, and I thought, ‘Who would be perfect for this track? Who’s the real boss?’ I wanted Too Short, and everybody was saying, ‘We can’t find him,'” Kelis says of her search for “the ultimate O.G.” “No one really supported that move, but when I put him on there everyone thought it was crazy.”

Kelis continued to trust her instincts while working on the rest of the album, cross-breeding her diverse inspirations, from old-school R&B to funk punk. “I never do just one thing,” she says. “It’s from one spectrum to another. It goes from really punk and fun and glam-ish to 1970, Roberta Flack, Chapter 2.”

The singer’s favorite tracks represent both ends of that spectrum. “‘Fire’ has, like, a dance-party vibe to it,” says Kelis. “But ‘Appreciate Me’ — that’s a really grown-up, woman’s song.”

The latter, softer track also finds the feisty performer digging just a bit deeper. “There’s a lot of storytelling on the record,” she says. “It’s just my life.”",mainstream
111,"SAN FRANCISCO — Geology is partly detective work, and scientists now have enough evidence to book a suspect in the biggest environmental catastrophe in Earth's history.



Painstaking analysis of rocks from China and Russia prove the culprit is a series of massive volcanic eruptions, which flooded ancient Siberia with thick lava flows just before Earth's worst mass extinction almost 252 million years ago, researchers said here Wednesday at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Thanks to new computer models of the eruption's devastating effects, and detailed mapping of rocks deposited around the time of the mass dying, researchers now have their best case ever for pinning the extinction on the enormous lava outpouring.

The eruptions — now called the Siberian Traps — lasted less than 1 million years but left behind Earth's biggest ""large igneous province,"" a pile of lava and other volcanic rocks about 720,000 cubic miles (3 million cubic kilometers) in volume. More than 96 percent of marine creatures and 70 percent of land species perished at the end of the Permian Period, versus 85 percent of life in the later dinosaur-killer extinction. In the Permian, all trilobites died out, along with 97 percent of the gorgeous marine creatures called ammonites. Sharks, fish and reptiles were hard hit.

""We can resolve the timing of the Siberian Traps and show that magmatism did precede the onset of mass extinction,"" said Seth Burgess, an MIT geochemistry graduate student who presented some of the research here. [Wipe Out: History's Most Mysterious Extinctions]

Ticking clock

Many suspects have been named in the environmental mass murder at the end of Permian, including the Siberian Traps, comet impacts, climate change and the breakup of a supercontinent. Resolving the question by dating ancient rocks often leaves a large margin of error, so scientists have been loathe to point a finger at any one cause. 



""This link between mass extinction and large igneous provinces [such as the Siberian Traps] is not a new hypothesis, but showing temporal overlap between the mass extinction and magmatism, the uncertainty [was] too high,"" Burgess said.

Burgess and his colleagues attacked the timing problem with a high-resolution, uranium-lead dating technique. The team tested volcanic rocks from the Siberian Traps and marine rocks from Meishan, China. Meishan is one of the best-preserved records of the mass extinction, as well as the transition between the Permian and the following Triassic Period. Burgess said the rocks were all analyzed in the same lab, on the same machine, with the same chemicals and by the same lab tech — all to minimize that extra few thousand years of error that scientists must report when estimating rock ages.

Burgess' new age for Meishan's Bed 25 (a thin rock layer that is the global reference point for the onset of extinction) is 251.941 million years ago, plus or minus 37,000 years. And volcanism started at the Siberian Traps 252.28 million years ago, plus or minus 11,000 years, Burgess said.

New ages for Meishan rock layers above and below Bed 25 also narrow down the duration of the mass extinction event to 60,000 years, plus or minus 40,000 years, Burgess said. The new timeline fits well with a remarkable new rock section from Penglaitan in South China, presented yesterday by Shu-zhong Shen, a paleontologist at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology in China. [The World's 10 Weirdest Geological Formations]

At Penglaitan, the extinction lasted only a few thousand years, based on abundant fossil and rock evidence, Shen said. Sixty Permian species disappear in the Penglaitan extinction layer. ""The end-Permian mass extinction is sudden,"" he said. And chemical signatures preserved in the ancient rocks indicate local temperatures jumped 14.4 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit (8 to 10 degrees Celsius) just after the extinction, an extreme warming seen in other places on the planet close to this age.

Environmental catastrophe

Other evidence of a major climatic change after the Permian die-off include sudden shifts in ratios of elements such as carbon and oxygen found worldwide. Researchers have long thought that volcanic gases from the Siberian Traps could have altered Earth's climate. Because the Siberian Traps' magma punched through sedimentary rocks such as coals and carbonates, the eruptions could have cooked the rocks, pouring extra billions of tons of greenhouse gases and toxic metals into Earth's atmosphere, according to modeling studies presented yesterday. Particles similar to fly ash from coal-fired power plants appear in lake sediments on Canada's Ellesmere Island, downwind of Siberia in the Permian, said Stephen Grasby, a geochemist at Canada's Geological Survey.



Gases such as carbon dioxide and methane warmed the Earth, and sulfur dioxide pelted the Northern Hemisphere with acid rain, researchers said. (Siberia was in the high latitudes 252 million years ago, so gases and ashes circled in the north.) ""Rain in the Northern Hemisphere could have been really intensely acidic,"" said Benjamin Black, a postdoctoral researcher at MIT. ""The pH was comparable to undiluted lemon juice.""

Black created a computer model of Earth's atmosphere during the Siberian Trap eruptions, when most of Earth's landmasses were jammed together in a supercontinent called Pangaea. A giant ocean called Panthalassa covered the rest of the globe.

Just one year's worth of volcanism from the Siberian Traps, or about 57 cubic miles (240 cubic km) of lava, could generate 1.46 billion tons of sulfur dioxide and devastate the Northern Hemisphere, Black's study found. [Big Blasts: History's 10 Most Destructive Volcanoes]

The toxic gases pouring from the Earth also created chemical reactions that destroyed the protective ozone layer, raising DNA-damaging ultraviolet radiation over much of the planet, Black said. ""Globally, average ozone levels fall below those observed in the Antarctic ozone hole in the 1990s,"" he said.

In total, more than 1,200 billion tons of methane and 4,000 billion tons of sulfur dioxide could have emerged from the Siberian Traps eruption, said Henrik Svensen, a geologist at the University of Oslo in Norway.

A better lineup

Because Siberia's volcanic eruptions flooded from the Earth for some 900,000 years, geologists are keen to further investigate which events were the killers, and which caused the environmental changes seen after the Permian extinction.



""The future of this work is resolving which part of the Siberian magmatism is related to the mass extinction and which part is the effective driver of environmental change,"" Burgess said.

Geologists are already trying to solve that puzzle, with new, more precise maps that reveal the eruption history of the Siberian Traps. It turns out the earliest layers, along the Kureika River, have been misidentified, independent volcanologist Dougal Jerram said yesterday.

Instead of rocks formed by volcanic explosions, as previously mapped, Jerram and his colleagues discovered thin lava flows. Then, higher up in the pile where the rocks are younger, the researchers saw a sharp transition appear: The thin layers suddenly grow thicker, meaning more lava started coming out with each eruption. (Like water from a tap, the amount of magma pouring from the Earth — from multiple gashes and vents — waxed and waned through time at the Siberian Traps.)

At this transition zone, ""it's like the volcanic taps suddenly switched on,"" Jerram told LiveScience. Further work could reveal if the massive gush matches with any of the Permian or Triassic disasters.

""We're starting to understand a little bit more about what's happening with the volcanic sequence. There's still quite a lot of work to do,"" Jerram said.

605,"Starting today through the end of the year, humankind will start consuming more resources than our planet can sustainably produce, according to the Global Footprint Network (GFN), which has been organizing such days since 1986.

""Humanity is using nature 1.75 times faster than our planet's ecosystems can regenerate,"" says the group. ""This is akin to using 1.75 Earths.""

Rich nations ""overshoot"" their resources before poorer ones, according to GFN. The US, Australia, Denmark and Canada overshoot before the end of March, while Cuba, Nicaragua, Iraq, and Ecuador don't overshoot until December.

""Earth Overshoot Day"" is based on something called the ""Ecological Footprint,"" which is used by the World Wildlife Fund, the United Nations Environment Program, the United Nations Development Program's Human Development Report, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

But is the Ecological Footprint good science? It's not.

Six years ago I helped debunk Earth Overshoot Day and the Ecological Footprint calculation it's based upon in a paper for the peer-reviewed scientific journal, PLOS Biology called ""Does the Shoe Fit? Real vs. Imagined Footprints.""

We broke down the six measures that comprise the Ecological Footprint and found that five of the six, including food and forestry, were either in balance or surplus. The only thing out-of-balance were humankind's carbon emissions.

But solving that problem doesn't require that rich nations become poor — or that poor nations remain poor — but simply that we move toward energy sources that don't produce carbon emissions, a process known as ""decarbonization.""

And the only two cases of nations significantly decarbonizing their energy supplies, France and Sweden, did so not by becoming poor but rather by becoming far richer thanks to the use of nuclear energy. Today, France spends little more than half as much as Germany to produce electricity that produces one-tenth of the carbon emissions, thanks to nuclear.

How did the creators of the Ecological Footprint hide what they had done? By implying that the way to solve climate change is by expanding forest cover to absorb industrial carbon emissions.

All of the supposed ""overshoot"" of resources is from carbon emissions that the Footprint converts into forest area needed to offset the emissions. The Footprint thus leads readers to ignore all the other ways of absorbing or never emitting CO2.

It gets worse. Different forests absorb carbon dioxide at different rates over time. But the Ecological Footprint arbitrarily chooses a single number to represent the rate of carbon uptake for all forests around the world for all time. The Ecological Footprint method is best known as ""garbage in, garbage out.""

The implication of the Ecological Footprint is thus either that everyone in wealthy developed nations like the US, Europe, and Australia should try to live like Cubans and Nicaraguans, or that we should convert all of the world's old-growth forests to fast-growing tree farms.

When we published our paper in 2013, it was widely covered in the media, including by Scientific American, New Science, and Le Monde, but that hasn't stopped the European Commission and other governmental bodies from recognizing ""Earth Overshoot Day"" on social media.

The Ecological Footprint and Earth Overshoot Day were created at the same time that Western European nations and the United Nations embraced a neo-Malthusian approach to environmental problems.

Ironically, the UN promoted the use of wood fuels over nuclear. In a 1987 report called “Our Common Future,” the UN denounced nuclear energy and insisted that poor nations should use wood fuel more sustainably. “The wood-poor nations must organize their agricultural sectors to produce large amounts of wood and other plant fuels.”

The lead author of “Our Common Future” was Gro Brundtland, former Prime Minister of Norway, a nation which just a decade earlier had become fabulously wealthy thanks to its abundant oil and gas reserves.

Figures like Brundtland promoted the idea that poor nations didn’t need to consume much energy, which turned out to be howlingly wrong. Energy consumption is as tightly coupled to per capita GDP today as it was when today’s rich nations were themselves poor.

There is no rich nation that depends primarily on wood for energy, just as there is no poor nation that depends primarily on fossil fuels or nuclear.

The Ecological Footprint has as much scientific merit as astrology, phrenology, and flat-earth theories. It's time to treat the Ecological Footprint as the pseudoscientific theory it is.",mainstream
420,"Thankfully, the fashion world has woken up to the idea that we should probably try to look after the planet a little better, because what’s the use of having the latest haute couture shoes if their only use is to trade for food in a post-climate change apocalyptic badland? On a different point, that nice jacket you’ve just bought doesn’t fit as well when you know it’s been made at an illegal factory, does it?

As is always the case in fashion, women’s brands are seen to be the ones making the biggest impact, mainly because it’s a much bigger industry. However, the last time I checked, men are not only pretty aware of the problems facing the environment and society, but also wear clothes. Here are three brands that any man concerned about sustainability should have on his radar.

Surf culture has always been at the forefront of eco-conscious activity, and Finisterre has carried the torch since its founding in 2003. Conceived by founder Tom Kay in a flat above a surf shop on the Devon coast in England, the brand’s ethos of functionality and sustainability has remained the same since day one.

Finisterre is named after a rocky peninsula off the coast of Galicia, Spain, which bears the brunt of the North Atlantic’s gales. Finisterre is derived from the Latin finis terrae, meaning “end of the earth”. Ancient Romans believed it was the end of the known world - if you’re looking for a rugged name, you can’t get much better.

The brand runs multiple eco projects and initiatives, from the “Microplastics Collection” looking to rapidly reduce the amount of plastic in our oceans, to using organic cotton, to eradicating all fluorocarbon from its waterproof clothes lines (fluorocarbon slowly leaks from the fabric, finding its way into the water system and food chain). Finally, the Finisterre Fabric Use-Up project is a commitment to use any spare fabric from its insulated clothing and waterproof jackets to create wallets, wash bags, hats, totes and more.

Finisterre even collaborates with other likeminded labels, such as Fashion Week favourite Christopher Raeburn, on limited lines.

Spanish newcomer Esgoa has joined the group of smaller brands looking to produce sustainable and ethical fashion without forgoing any quality - or luxury. Its Kickstarter - which only closed in December 2018 - puts the “global transition towards sustainable fashion” front and centre, and promotes some much-needed transparency in how our clothes are made. The cotton used is, of course, organic, and certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard, an organisation that collates environmental, quality and social assessments to make sure brands practise what they preach.

The clothes are all made in Spain, in factories that are up to the standards of the International Labour Organisation. Factory workers have freely chosen to work there, working conditions are safe and hygienic, a minimum wage is in place, and reasonable and regular work is guaranteed.

This is all very laudable, but Esgoa backs its morals up with some seriously nice shirts. Named after three Spanish literary giants - the Vega, Neruda and Cervantes - each shirt has an Esgoa-designed cutaway collar, contrast buttonholes and a flattering, tailored fit. Una de cada una, por favor.

Swedish shoe and outerwear brand Tretorn was founded in 1891, but has recently committed to changing its practices, reusing waste fabric in new products and cutting down on this waste to begin with. Its Eco Essentials Initiative takes a look at the brand as a whole and looks at ways in which it can be changed for the better. Its latest commitment was to label 50 per cent of its outerwear as Eco Essential by 2020, but is already at 85 per cent. Slightly ahead of schedule, then.

The Leftover Project buys leftover fabrics from other brands and creates limited edition releases based on whatever buyers have been able to get their hands on. The Ghost Net collection takes the fishing nets replaced every two years by the local fishing fleet and incorporates them into Tretorn clothing. These nets would otherwise be cut off into the ocean, becoming ‘ghost nets’, drifting through the sea and potentially destroying swaths of ecosystems. The clever bods at the brand are also developing a 100 percent biodegradable light rain jacket, made from plants like sugarcane and tapioca, which will meld back into the ecosystem when you’re finally finished with it.",mainstream
26,"The importance of Status cannot be over stated. Treaties with a corporation seems to be a stretch, especially when a corporation is a continuing criminal enterprise called UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 4, in a perpetual state of bankruptcy, held under a military coup d’etat, occupied by another criminal enterprise called the Crown Temple B.A.R., which is an arm of a complete fraud and criminal enterprise called the Church of the Holy See, a.k.a. the Vatican, pretending to be a Godly entity, but in reality is a Satanic conglomerate of Banksters and military, run by Masonic Zionist-Jesuits. These pirates ran their vessel aground upon the Territory or District of Columbia. They have foot soldiers called Attorners/Brokers who bring the Law of the Sea onto the land, or more accurately, Admiralty Maritime Law. This is serious crime, this land piracy. Commercial Code foisted upon living people, outside contractual agreement is their game, so the material below can help ward off the fraud, provided you don’t have the status of “Incompetent Imbecile/U.S. citizen.” The face of the top of Commerce is the Universal Postal Union on Berne on Switzerland.

The UPU (Universal Postal Union) in Berne, Switzerland, is an extremely significant organization in today’s world. It is formulated by treaty. No nation can be recognized as a nation without being in international admiralty in order to have a forum common to all nations for engaging in commerce and resolving disputes. That is why the USA under the Articles of Confederation could not be recognized as a country. Every state (colony) was sovereign, with its own common law, which foreclosed other countries from interacting with the USA as a nation in international commerce. Today, international admiralty is the private jurisdiction of the IMF, et al., the creditor in the bankruptcy of essentially every government on Earth.

The UPU operates under the authority of treaties with every country in the world. It is, as it were, the overlord or overseer over the common interaction of all countries in international commerce. Every nation has a postal system, and also has reciprocal banking and commercial relationships, whereby all are within and under the UPU. The UPU is the number one military (international admiralty is also military) contract mover on the planet.

For this reason one should send all important legal and commercial documents through the post office rather than private carriers, which are firewalls. We want direct access to the authority—and corresponding availability of remedy and recourse—of the UPU. For instance, if you post through the US Post Office and the US Postmaster does not provide you with the remedy you request within twenty-one (21) days, you can take the matter to the UPU.

Involving the authority of the UPU is automatically invoked by the use of postage stamps. Utilization of stamps includes putting stamps on any documents (for clout purposes, not mailing) we wish to introduce into the system. As long as you use a stamp (of any kind) you are in the game. If you have time, resources, and the luxury of dealing with something well before expiration of a given time frame, you can use stamps that you consider ideal. The most preferable stamps are ones that are both large and contain the most colors. In an emergency situation, or simply if economy is a consideration, any stamp will do. Using a postage stamp and autograph on it makes you the postmaster for that contract. 

 Whenever you put a stamp on a document, inscribe your full name over the stamp at an angle. The color ink you use for this is a function of what color will show up best against the colors in the stamp. Ideal colors for doing this are purple (royalty), blue (origin of the bond), and gold (king’s edict). Avoid red at all cost. Obviously, if you have a dark, multi-colored stamp you do not want to use purple or blue ink, since your autograph on it would not stand out as well if you used lighter color ink. Ideally one could decide on the best color for his autograph and then obtain stamps that best suit one’s criteria and taste. Although a dollar stamp is best, it is a luxury unless one is well off financially. Otherwise, reserve the use of dollar stamps for crucial instruments, such as travel documents. The rationale for using two-cent stamps is that in the 19th Century the official postage rate for the de jure Post Office of the United States of America was fixed at two (2) cents. For stamps to carry on one’s person for any kind of unexpected encounter or emergency use, this denomination might be ideal.

Use stamps on important documents, such as a check, travel documents, paperwork you put in court, etc. Where to put the stamp and how many stamps to use depend on the document. On foundational documents and checks, for instance, put a stamp on the right hand corner of the instrument, both on the front and on the back. The bottom right hand corner of the face of a check, note, or bill of exchange signifies the liability. Furthermore, the bottom right hand corner of the reverse of the document is the final position on the page, so no one can endorse anything (using a restricted endorsement or otherwise) after that. You want to have the last word. If you have only one stamp, put it where you are expected to sign and autograph over it cross-wise. In the case of a traffic ticket, for instance, put a stamp on the lower right hand corner where you are supposed to sign and autograph across the stamp at an angle.

Autographing a stamp not only establishes you as the postmaster of the contract but constitutes a cross-claim. Using the stamp process on documents presents your adversaries with a problem because their jurisdiction is subordinate to that of the UPU, which you have now invoked for your benefit. The result in practice of doing this is that whenever those who know what you are doing are recipients of your documents with autographed stamps they back off. If they do not, take the matter to the US Postmaster to deal with. If he will not provide you with your remedy, take the matter to the UPU for them to clean up.

The countries whose stamps would be most effective to use are China, Japan, United States, and Great Britain. Utilizing these countries covers both East and West. However, since the US seems to be the point man in implementing the New World Order, one might most advisably use US stamps.

If you put stamps on documents you submit into court, put a stamp on the back of each page, at the bottom right hand corner. Do not place any stamps on the front of court paperwork since doing so alarms the clerk. By placing your autographed stamp on the reverse right hand corner you prevent being damaged by one of the tricks of judges these days. A judge might have your paperwork on his bench, but turned over so only the back side, which is ordinarily blank on every page, is visible. Then if you ask about your paperwork he might say something like, “Yes, I have your paperwork in front of me but I don’t find anything.” He can’t see anything on the blank side of a page. If you place an autographed stamp on the lower right hand corner you foreclose a judge from engaging in this trick.

In addition, when it comes to court documents, one side is criminal and the other is civil. Using the autographed stamp that you rubber-stamp with your seal (bullet stamp) on the back side of your court documents is evidence that you possess the cancelled obligation on the civil side. Since there can be no assessment for criminal charges, and you show that you are the holder of the civil assessment, there is no way out for the court.

Also, in any court document you put in, handwrite your EIN number [SS# w.o. dashes] in gold on the top right corner of every page, with the autographed stamp on the back side. 

 Use of a notary combined with the postage stamp (and sometime Embassy stamps) gives you a priority mechanism. Everything is commerce, and all commerce is contract. The master of the contract is the post office, and the UPU is the supreme overlord of the commerce, banking, and postal systems of the world. Use of these stamps in this manner gets the attention of those in the system to whom you provide your paperwork. It makes you the master of that post office. Use of the stamp is especially important when dealing with the major players, such as the FBI, CIA, Secret Service, Treasury, etc. They understand the significance of what you are doing. Many times they hand documents back to someone using this approach and say, “Have a good day, sir.” They don’t want any untoward repercussions coming back on them.

If anyone asks you why you are doing what you are doing, suggest that they consult their legal counsel for the significance. It is not your job to explain the law, nor explain such things as your exemption or Setoff Account. The system hangs us by our own words. We have to give them the evidence, information, contacts, and legal determinations they require to convict us. The wise words of Calvin Coolidge, the most taciturn president in US history, are apt. When asked why he spoke so little, he replied, “I have never been hurt by anything I didn’t say.”

The bottom line is that whenever you need to sign any legal/commercial document, put a stamp (even a one (1) cent stamp) over where you sign and sign at an angle across it. Let the recipient deal with the significance and consequences of your actions. If you are in a court case, or at any stage of a proceeding (such as an indictment, summons, complaint, or any other hostile encounter with the system), immediately do the following: 

 1. Make a color copy of whatever documents you receive, or scan them in color into your computer; 

 2. Stamp the original of the first page of every document with the ARFV stamp, put a postage stamp in the signature space, and autograph across it at an angle with your full name, using purple or blue ink, handwritten with upper- and lower-case, with your gold-ink bullet stamp (seal) on the upper left-hand portion of the postage stamp; 

 Make a color copy of the stamped, autographed pages and/or scan into your computer; 

 3. Put a stamp on the lower right-hand-corner of the back of every page and bullet-stamp and autograph it; 

 4. Have a notary send each document back to the sender, with a notarial certificate of service, with or without an accompanying/supporting affidavit by you; 

 5. If you have an affidavit, put an autographed stamp on the upper right hand corner of the first page and the lower right hand corner of the back of every page.

 People who have engaged in this process report that when any knowledgeable judge, attorney, or official sees this, matters change dramatically. All of these personages know what mail fraud is. Since autographing the stamp makes you the postmaster of the contract, anyone who interferes is tampering with the mail and engaging in mail fraud. You can then subpoena the postmaster (either of the post office from which the letter was mailed, or the US Postmaster General, or both), and have them explain what the rules are, under deposition or testimony on the witness stand in open court.

In addition, most of the time when you get official communication it has a red-meter postage mark on the envelope rather than a cancelled stamp. This act is mail fraud. If the envelope has a red-meter postage mark on it, they are the ones who have engaged in mail fraud, because there is no cancelled stamp. It is the cancelled stamp that has the power; an un-cancelled stamp has nothing. A red-meter postage mark is an uncancelled stamp. If it is not cancelled, it is not paid. One researcher has scanned everything into his computer, and has more red-meter postage marks than he “can shake a stick at.” Officials sending things out by cancelled stamp is a rarity—perhaps at most 2%.

With the red-metered postage you can trace each communication back to the PO from which it was sent, so you can get the postmaster for that PO, as well as the postmaster general for the US, to investigate the mail fraud involved. It is reasonable to conclude that canceling a stamp both registers the matter and forms a contract between the party that cancels the stamp and the UPU. Using a stamp for postage without canceling it is prima facie evidence that the postmaster of the local PO is committing mail fraud by taking a customer’s money and not providing the paid-for service and providing you with the power of a cancelled stamp, as required under the provisions of the UPU. When you place an autographed stamp on a document you place that document and the contract underlying it under international law and treaty, with which the courts have no jurisdiction to deal. The system cannot deal with the real you, the living principal (as evidenced and witnessed by jurat). Nor can officials, attorneys, judges, et al., go against the UPU, international law, and treaty. In addition, they have no authority/jurisdiction to impair a contract between you (as the living principal) and the UPU (overseer of all world commerce).

You cancelled the stamp by sealing it and autographing across it. You did so in capacity of being the living principal, as acknowledged by your seal and the jurat on your documents. 

 If you are in a court case, bring in your red-metered envelopes in court and request the judge to direct the prosecutor to explain the red-meter postage stamp. Then watch their jaws drop. Doing this is especially potent if you also have asked the prosecutor to provide his bar number, since most attorneys in court—especially in US—are not qualified. An attorney in federal court had better have a six-digit bar card or he committed a felony just by walking in and giving his name.

Lastly, if you are charged with mail fraud, subpoena the prosecutor(s) to bring in the evidence on which mail fraud is being alleged, as well as the originals of all envelopes used for mailing any item connected with the case. Then the mail fraud involved was committed by the postmaster of the PO in which the envelope was stamped.",conspiracy

761,"Stargazers will be treated to a spectacular fireball show early next week when Earth hits a belt of comet debris known as the Perseids, astronomers say.The annual Perseid meteor shower, dubbed ""the tears of St Lawrence"" in honour of a martyred Christian saint, should peak in the wee hours of Monday and Tuesday with between 60 and 100 shooting stars per hour.They will be visible over most of the world, but most clearly in the northern hemisphere, aided by an early-setting crescent Moon leaving a dark canvas for the celestial fireworks.Cloudless skies permitting, the best viewing time will be the hours just before dawn on Monday and Tuesday, the head of US space agency NASA's meteoroid office, Bill Cooke, told AFP.""Go outside, allow about 30-45 minutes for your eyes to dark adapt. Lie flat on your back (sleeping bag or lawn chair) and look straight up: take in as much of the sky as you can,"" he said by email.""My experience is that most people who are disappointed viewing meteors go out for only a few minutes expecting to see something: this will work only for major outbursts not normal meteor showers. So be prepared to spend at least a couple of hours outside; don't expect to see many before midnight.""According to the European Space Agency, the Perseids are sand- to pea-sized bits of rocky debris ejected by the comet Swift-Tuttle, which is slowly disintegrating on its orbit around the Sun.Over the centuries, its remains have spread along the comet's orbit to form a stream of particles hundreds of millions of kilometres long.Earth's path around the Sun crosses the stream every mid-August.The particles, called meteoroids, hit our planet's atmosphere at about 60 kilometres per second (37 miles per second) -- each igniting in a white-hot streak of superheated air.According to Cooke, the Perseid showers produce more fireballs than any other.They are named after the star constellation of Perseus from which they appear to spread out, and have been seen for about 2,000 years -- the earliest observations recorded in China.St. Lawrence was an early Christian deacon tortured to death by the Romans in AD 258. His saint's day of August 10 coincides with the Perseids buildup.According to legend, Laurentius was martyred on a iron grill over a fire, during which ordeal he is said to have quipped to his persecutors: ""Turn me over.

528,"China BANS coronavirus testing to achieve near-zero infection rate, medicine goes “political” to protect communist regime

You may not have heard, but there’s now a second wave of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) sweeping China, and the communist regime is actually prohibiting further testing in order to perpetuate the illusion that there are no more people being infected with it.

In a video shared to Twitter, a doctor from the Hanyang District of Wuhan, the epicenter of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), explains how one individual recently tried to take his mother to the Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital for a blood test, only to be told the very next day that the blood test had been suspended.

Initially, specialists from the central government said that this blood test represents the seventh version of diagnosis and that it is actually more effective and accurate than another type of test that costs more. But it was suspended anyway.

As it turns out, no such blood tests are being performed on anyone at the Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital, nor at the nearby People’s Hospital. And the doctor in the video believes that similar policies are in place elsewhere throughout China, presumably to try to save face.

“This is not a medical problem,” he says. “This is called a political diagnosis and a political cure. Not related to medicine at all.”

According to this doctor, many Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) patients are being discharged from hospitals as “cleared” of the virus without getting this important blood test. This allows communist China to claim that the virus has been “eradicated,” when in fact many of these people likely still have it.

Everyone should get tested for coronavirus, doctor says

We already know this to be the case from earlier reports indicating that many “recovered” patients are testing positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) a second time, despite having been “cleared” as virus-free.

The doctor in this video says that every single person should be getting tested, including people who aren’t former patients. Since the test only takes about 15 minutes to perform and isn’t all that expensive, it would be simple enough to test everybody just to be sure.

But will this actually happen? Much like the failure to test that’s taking place in the United States, probably not, even though people are doling out their own hard-earned cash to try to make it happen.

“They don’t let anyone in this city do the blood test,” this doctor laments. “It’s a problem of politics, can’t you call it a political problem?”

The China Daily News, responding to this video post on Twitter, stated that the communist Chinese regime relaxed its control far too early “because of economic and political pressure, in hope of keeping the economy from completely collapsing.”

“Now there is a rebound in cases,” the outlets added. “They are trying to blame that on ‘imported’ cases.”

Another poster suggests that the time is now to punish China for hiding its first case of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) on November 17, and only deciding to act months later during the third week of January, “meanwhile infecting the whole world,” this poster wrote.

“[Four-fifths of the pandemic] originated in China. They ruined family, job, economy, hope, future” this same account added, noting that whistleblowers have been getting arrested and even killed for trying to spill the beans about what’s really going on over there.

755,"A group of conspiracy theorists who believe that the Earth is flat will one day embark on a trip to Antarctica to visit what they consider the 'end of the world.'

Prominent members of the group have recently expressed interest in traveling to the distant continent to prove 'once and for all' that the planet is not spherical, Forbes reports.

In the meantime, the Flat Earth International Conference (FEIC), which is not associated with the Flat Earth Society, will embark on a cruise sometime in 2020 for its annual event. 



In a statement to dailymail.com, founder of the FEIC, Robbie Davidson clarified that the 2020 excursion is 'just a cruise,' and the group isn't yet shooting to find the 'ice shore' at the end of the world.

The plan, however, has drawn ridicule from experts who point out that navigation by sea relies entirely on the spherical model of Earth.

An upcoming conference for the group will be held in Dallas, Texas in November and marks the third annual event hosted by the FEIC.

A representative for the group did not respond to a request for more details before publication.

Since the group's announcement about plans to host 2020's conference aboard a cruise ship, the idea has been singled out by some for its irony, given that cruise ships navigate their surroundings using equipment based on a spherical model of Earth.

Global Position Systems (GPS) in particular use a network of satellites that orbit the Earth to ping off of each other and pinpoint one's location.

In a report by The Guardian, Henk Keijer, a longtime cruise ship captain gives his thoughts on the FEIC's plans.

'I have sailed 2 million miles, give or take,' Keijer told The Guardian. 'I have not encountered one sea captain who believes the Earth is flat.'

The Flat Earth International Conference is part of a rising tide of groups who reject the heliocentric model of the Earth and claim that our planet — instead of an oblate spheroid — is actually a disk or dome-like shape and that Antarctica surrounds the perimeter to form a kind of ice wall.

To bolster their theory, some flat-Earthers have also endorsed other conspiracies, including claims that the U.S. faked its moon landing and that NASA has worked to obscure the truth about outer space and our planet's place in it.

As the flat Earth movement gains traction, it has also caught the attention of documentarians looking to both profile and in some cases debunk the ideas set forth by groups like the Flat Earth Society.

Recent additions to the sphere include Netflix's 'Behind the Curve' and an upcoming 'documentary' by controversial YouTube star, Logan Paul, titled 'Flat Earth: to the Edge and Back,' which appears to show Paul succumbing to flat Earth conspiracies.

Paul's film will be released on March 20.

The prominence of flat Earth conspiracies has been amplified by the increasing popularity of internet conspiracy theorists who grow their audiences on popular video hosting platforms like YouTube.

In a recent study from researchers at Texas Tech University found that of the 30 respondents interviewed at a Flat Earth event, all but one identified YouTube as a major factor in how they came to believe the theories.

Some parties have called on the streaming service to tweak its algorithm in order to stem the spread of misinformation and prioritize reliable science, a call YouTube has begun to heed in recent months.

'We recently announced that we'll begin reducing recommendations of borderline content or videos that could misinform users in harmful ways—such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11,' a YouTube representative told Mail Online in February.",mainstream
214,"On February 3, 1851, a 32-year-old Frenchman—who’d dropped out of medical school and dabbled in photography—definitively demonstrated that the Earth indeed rotated, surprising the Parisian scientific establishment.

Acting on a hunch, Léon Foucault had determined that he could use a pendulum to illustrate the effect of the Earth’s movement. He called together a group of scientists, enticing them with a note declaring, “You are invited to see the Earth turn.” Foucault hung a pendulum from the ceiling of the Meridian Room of the Paris Observatory. As it swept through the air, it traced a pattern that effectively proved the world was spinning about an axis.

A month later, Foucault shared his experiment with all of Paris at the majestic Pantheon building. According to the American Physical Society, he suspended from the Pantheon’s lofty dome a 61-pound brass bob on a 220-foot cable. As it swung back and forth, the pointed end of the bob traced lines in sand that had been poured on a wooden platform. Over time, the angle of these lines changed, suggesting to audience members that the direction of the pendulum’s travel was shifting under the influence of an unperceived rotational motion—that of Earth.

Foucault was able to demonstrate a scientific concept in a way that the average person could easily grasp, says Rebecca C. Thompson, head of public outreach for the APS. For centuries, it was a commonly held belief that the Earth rotated on an axis. But it was Foucault who dispelled lingering doubts once and for all, establishing the phenomenon firmly in the realm of fact. “It really started the cultural shift to fundamentally understanding our universe differently,” Thompson says.

The experiment was a hit, drawing flocks of fascinated Parisians and catapulting Foucault to fame. Pendulums based on Foucault’s calculations began appearing worldwide—and are still iconic features of many science museums in the U.S. and other countries.

The Smithsonian Institution made a pendulum a focal point of its Museum of History and Technology (which later became the National Museum of American History). The building—which opened in 1964 on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.—was designed purposely to accommodate a pendulum. It hung from the ceiling of the third floor and stretched 71 feet through the center of the building, where it swung slowly and rhythmically across a fancifully emblazoned circle on the first floor. The Smithsonian pendulum was intended to be viewed from above, on the second floor.

Looking down, visitors would see a symmetrical hollow brass bob weighing about 240 pounds and shaped like an inverted teardrop. As it moved back and forth—facilitated by an electromagnetic push to keep it continuously swinging despite air resistance and vibrations in the cable—it would knock down inch-or-so-high pins standing at fixed points along the circumference of a small circle. Over time, viewers could see the direction of the pendulum’s swing change, implying that the Earth was rotating beneath them.

The Smithsonian pendulum, like all pendulums, moved in accordance with Foucault’s sine law, which predicts how much a pendulum’s path will distort each day based on its latitude. Absent any exterior forces, a pendulum would swing back and forth in a single plane forever—there would be no gradual angular shift. But the Earth is rotating, so the story isn’t that simple.

Since all points on Earth’s surface rotate as a unit, it follows that those located on the wider portions of the planet—nearer to the equator—must cover more meters each second (i.e., go faster) to “keep up” with the points tracing smaller circles each day at the extreme northern and southern latitudes. Though they don’t feel it, a person standing in Quito, Ecuador, is moving with appreciably higher velocity than one in Reykjavik, Iceland.

Because each swing of a pendulum takes it from a point farther from the equator to a point nearer to the equator and vice versa, and the velocities at these points differ, the path of the pendulum is subtly distorted with every swing, gradually torqued away from its original orientation. The extent of this effect depends on where on Earth the pendulum is swinging.

At the North Pole—where small changes in latitude have big implications—the path traced by a pendulum would shift through a full 360 degrees in a mere 24 hours, explains Thompson. At the equator, meanwhile, a pendulum’s motion would not be seen to distort at all.

Using his sine law, Foucault predicted that the path of his pendulum in Paris would shift 11.25 degrees each hour, or 270 degrees in a day. And it did.

His sine law allows anyone with a decent grounding in trigonometry to use a pendulum to determine their latitude. But mostly, at museums around the world, the pendulum has become an object that elicits wonder.

As iconic as the elephant that greets visitors in the rotunda of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, the pendulum at the History and Technology museum was a meeting place, a striking backdrop for reflection and education. “It was very much like a fountain in a park,” says Peter Liebhold, a curator in the division of work and industry at the American History Museum.

Children and adults alike would stare at the pendulum, meditating on its motion and meaning. One morning in 1998, before the museum had opened, the cable snapped, sending the massive bob hurtling towards the floor, narrowly missing a staffer.

Rather than repair the cable, the museum elected to retire Foucault’s pendulum. Its director at the time decided the device did not have much to do with either America or history, says Liebhold.

The decision divided staffers. “There were pendulum huggers and pendulum haters,” Liebhold says. Pro-pendulum employees said it was cool and fun to watch. The anti-pendulum group believed it didn’t add much to the museum’s efforts to teach the public about American history and culture.

Though Liebhold says he was in the haters’ camp, he believes pendulums have their place, just elsewhere. A pendulum “makes the masses more trusting of the power of science,” he says.

Thompson agrees, and notes that while the pendulum is no longer needed to prove that the Earth rotates, “it is useful if we can get kids engaged in science.”",mainstream
762,"It's the stuff that high-tech dreams need if they are to come true: rare raw materials like rhodium, tantalum, cobalt or coltan that are used in almost every innovative consumer product. Without these metals and minerals, there would be no mobile phones, iPads, flat screens, catalytic converters or electric cars.

Without them, the modern world would not exist in its present state. But the enormous number of ways in which these commodities can be used go together with the enormous dependence which European industries now have towards the suppliers of these products, almost all of which have to be imported. Supply can barely keep up with demand. China has curbed exports to meet growing domestic demand - and that's a threat for Europe, which depends heavily on China for it supplies. Businesses across the continent worry about looming shortfalls and increased prices.

For years, the EU debated how Europe could hold its own in the battle for valuable raw materials. In February 2011, the EU Commission presented a strategy which many experts criticized as not going far enough. A year later, the Commission launched an ""Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials"" with revised, more concrete proposals. Together, EU member states, businesses, private and state researchers plan to further the exploration, extraction and processing of raw materials.

“We need to join forces to tap Europe's enormous own potential of raw materials,"" European Commission Vice-President Antonio Tajani said. ""It will be the key to Europe's ability to develop today the technologies of tomorrow. Such innovation is decisive for Europe's competitiveness, sustainable growth and new jobs.""

The Commission has set firm goals to be reached by 2020 and first results are expected within 1 to 3 years. The idea is to tap European raw material sources in order to reduce the dependency on imports. The EU Commission accepts optimistic estimates that Europe has unexploited mineral resources worth about 100 billion euros ($ 131.2 billion) - but they are to be found 500 to 1,000 meters underground or under the sea.

Hubertus Bardt, an expert on raw materials at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) welcomed the Commission's proposals as an important step forward. ""It's a bit late, but if they manage to do what they've planned, Europe is going in the right direction,"" he told DW. Bardt warned, however, that to be competitive, Europe must mine its resources ""at a bearable cost.""

The EU Commission is aware of the cost factor, and hopes new technologies will help to extract materials more efficiently in deep, remote areas. The mining industry could become more competitive and sustainable by employing remote control and automation. Substitutes for critical raw materials have to be developed and electronic equipment must be recycled in a more environmentally friendly manner. Recycling is high on the agenda: on average, every EU citizen produces 17 kilograms of electronic scrap per year. The EU expects that figure to rise to 24 kilograms by 2020.

All EU member states are expected to agree to the innovation partnership, at least in theory - in practise, its concrete implementation could be problematic.

""Unfortunately, not all states work together,"" Reinhard Bütikofer, a German member of the Greens in the European Parliament, told DW.

Electronic waste is a great source of raw materials because it contains many rare metals that can be recycled, he said - but discarded electronic equipment is often exported illegally from the EU only to be incinerated. Bütikofer appealed to EU states to implement existing legislation to prevent this export, as a result of which, ""the soil is poisoned, the health of children in developing countries is destroyed, and in addition, the raw materials are more or less gone.""

An innovation partnership, Bütikofer said, is certain to help make Europe less open to economic blackmail by China. But he added the EU should also develop partnerships with other producing countries in Africa or South America because European resources are not sufficient.

""China is very dominant where some rare raw materials are concerned - but only because Europe and the US have let it happen. By no means does China have a monopoly,"" he told DW.

Hubertus Bardt of the IW is convinced Europe needs international help to free itself from its dependance on Chinese imports. He said the biggest challenge is to keep the markets open and not to disturb the balance of import and export of raw materials.

""That is the big quarrel with China, which seals off its market and tries to draw production from Europe and the US to the country,"" Bardt said, pointing out that the government in Beijing has tried to force foreign buyers to process their raw materials in China.

Bardt urged Europe to counter that development in the framework of international trade agreements - and developing its own sources of raw materials will surely give the EU better negotiating leverage.",mainstream
658,"Some former NASA astronauts have a message for flat-Earther B.o.B: The curve is real, and we've seen it.

Last week, the Atlanta-based rapper kicked off a crowdfunding campaign to raise $1 million, ostensibly so he can build and launch one or more satellites to settle the ""question"" of Earth's shape once and for all.

B.o.B doubts that Earth is round because the horizon looks pretty flat in photos taken from the planet's surface. That's a simple consequence of Earth's large size, of course, but B.o.B doesn't see it that way. ""Help B.o.B find the curve!"" the crowdfunding project's description reads, in part. [7 Ways to Prove the Earth Is Round Without Satellites]

This plea elicited a response from former NASA astronaut Terry Virts.

""I can save BoB a lot of money — the Earth is round. I flew around it,"" Virts tweeted Wednesday (Sept. 27) via his @AstroTerry account.

Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin (@TheRealBuzz) responded to Virts Wednesday, tweeting, ""I did too. It's called an orbit: the curved path of a celestial object around a star, planet, or moon.""

Retired astronaut Scott Kelly also chimed in Wednesday, posting a time-lapse video of our planet as seen from the International Space Station.

""Show you the curve? Here you go @bobatl! One full orbit around Earth. Maybe donate funds raised to #PuertoRicoRelief,"" Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) tweeted.

B.o.B hasn't been swayed by thousands of satellite photos, the circumnavigation of the globe, common sense or any of the other evidence showing beyond a shadow of a doubt that Earth is round, so Virts, Aldrin and Kelly are probably just shouting into the wind. But hey, it's worth a shot.

913,"The countdown to launch creeps closer and there's still plenty for self-taught rocket scientist ""Mad"" Mike Hughes to do: Last-second modifications to his vessel. Pick up his flight suit. Leave enough food for his four cats -- just in case anything happens.

Hughes is a 61-year-old limo driver who's spent the last few years building a steam-powered rocket out of salvage parts in his garage. His project has cost him $20,000, which includes Rust-Oleum paint to fancy it up and a motor home he bought on Craigslist that he converted into a ramp.

His first test of the rocket will also be the launch date -- Saturday, when he straps into his homemade contraption and attempts to hurtle over the ghost town of Amboy, California. He will travel about a mile at a speed of roughly 500 mph.

""If you're not scared to death, you're an idiot,"" Hughes said. ""It's scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive. I like to do extraordinary things that no one else can do, and no one in the history of mankind has designed, built and launched himself in his own rocket. I'm a walking reality show.""

The daredevil-limo driver has been called a little bit of everything over his career -- eccentric, quirky, foolhardy. Doesn't bother him. He believes what he believes, including that the Earth is flat. He knows this thought is a conundrum, given that he's about to launch himself into the atmosphere.

Down the road, he's intending to build a rocket that takes him to space, so he can snap a picture and see with his own eyes.

""I don't believe in science,"" said Hughes, whose main sponsor for the rocket is Research Flat Earth. ""I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics, and how things move through the air, about the certain size of rocket nozzles, and thrust. But that's not science, that's just a formula. There's no difference between science and science fiction.""

This will actually be the second time he's constructed and launched a rocket. He jumped on a private property in Winkelman, Arizona, on Jan. 30, 2014, and traveled 1,374 feet. He collapsed after that landing -- the G-forces taking a toll -- and needed three days to recover.

That distance, though, would've been enough to clear the Snake River Canyon, which is a jump daredevil Evel Knievel made famous when he failed to clear it during his attempt in 1974. Stuntman Eddie Braun did successfully zoom over the canyon -- using Knievel's original blueprints -- in September 2016.

Just don't mention Knievel around Hughes. He's not a fan.

""He was an average stunt guy,"" said Hughes, a former motorcycle racer. ""He stole his look from Elvis.""

Hughes constructed his latest rocket at the ""Rocket Ranch"" in Apple Valley, California. It's a five-acre property he leases from Waldo Stakes, the CEO of Land Speed Research Vehicles, who's currently working on a project to make a car travel 2,000 mph.

Their relationship formed a few years ago when Hughes approached Stakes about building a rocket. Stakes receives plenty of these sorts of requests, but this one stood out because Hughes was building it himself.

""Nothing is out of reach,"" Stakes said. ""Anything can be done. You just have to put enough money, time and thought into it.""

Here's the thing: Hughes doesn't make all that much money -- $15 per hour as a limo driver, plus tips. That's why he's scrounged for parts, finding the aluminum for his rocket in metal shops and constructing the rocket nozzle out of an aircraft air filter. He gave it a good varnish of cheap paint, and his launch pad is attached to a motor home he bought for $1,500.

""I want to inspire others, and you have to do something incredible to get anybody's attention,"" Hughes said.

The location of the jump will be Amboy, a ghost town in the Mojave Desert and along historic Route 66. The fictional town of Radiator Springs in the Disney movie ""Cars"" was loosely based on Amboy.

Hughes got permission from the town's owner, Albert Okura, who purchased the rights to Amboy in 2005 for $435,000. The launch will take place on an air strip next to a dilapidated hangar.

""It is absolutely the most wacky promotional proposal I have had since I purchased the entire town in 2005,"" said Okura, who's also the founder of the Juan Pollo restaurant chain. ""He is a true daredevil and I want to be part of it.""

On the morning of the launch, Hughes will heat about 70 gallons of water in a stainless steel tank and then blast off between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. He plans to go about a mile -- reaching an altitude of about 1,800 feet -- before pulling two parachutes. They're discouraging fans, safety issues, but it will be televised on his YouTube channel. He said he's been in contact with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management.

Following his jump, he said he's going to announce his plans to leap into the race for governor of California. No joke.

His future plans include an excursion into space. He and Stakes have already brainstormed on a ""Rockoon,"" which is a rocket that, rather than being immediately ignited while on the ground, is carried into the atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon, then separated from the balloon and lit. This rocket will take Hughes about 68 miles up.

First things first -- this jump over a ghost town. He will be tinkering with his rocket right up to takeoff.

""A guy who builds his own rocket in his garage, about to jump a mile is pretty cool,"" Hughes said. ""It's the most interesting human-interest story in the world.""",mainstream
94,"The Cosmic Pattern of Creation That Builds Our Illusions

Editor’s Note: As a primer, please enjoy the first part of this article, Reality is Beyond Our Perception.

Looking to outer space you find countless stars, suns, like the star of this solar system, with planets of their own in orbit. Constantly moving and vibrating, they follow the same universal laws of all, as do the atom and the microcosmic solar system. Indeed, anywhere we look in life, be it outer space or inner space, everything is either atoms or solar systems. They are like octaves of the same thing – micro-/macrocosms. There is nothing else. What is a building? A tree? They, and anything else that seems to be something else, are but an assembly of atoms/solar systems. I can’t emphasise the significance of this enough. It is one of the most important facts there is, and understanding its full meaning is one of the great keys to understanding the universe and our lives.

The next great key can also be seen with atoms and solar systems – their orbital pattern, their orbital relationship. It is the one primary pattern in the universe. It pervades everything, and all else is built upon it. It is what our human male/female relationships are based on. It is what makes soulmates soul mates. But aren’t orbits separate things amongst separate solar systems or atoms? How could this pattern be what everything in the universe is built upon? And how could it be what human relationships are based on? Look into space at night. Each shining star you see is either a sun – an object radiating light that is surrounded by and orbited by planets – or a planet, giving off light reflected from the light of a star. Study what scientists have discovered about the solid objects that surround us – water, trees, buildings, stones, Earth, plants, human bodies; they are all made of atoms.



And what are atoms? Microscopic stars which are orbited by planets, but very tiny, and very, very rapidly. They are an octave of the stars and our own solar system. We had this knowledge long before the ignorant masses discovered that the Earth wasn’t flat. Before they discovered that the Earth wasn’t the centre of the universe. Before they discovered that the Earth revolved around the sun, rather than what they previously thought – that the sun revolved around the Earth. Before they discovered atoms. Soon they will discover more, and more. Consider: what if everything is orbiting something else? What if when you get smaller than atoms, and bigger than solar systems, the same, or similar, circular orbital pattern is found? It is so, in some way or another. Even though they haven’t discovered it yet much of this has recently been discovered by modern science.

What if it goes on infinitely like a never ending spiral? It must. It is the pattern of creation, of the universal spirit. If you contemplate it for a while, the pattern of an atom or solar system is, in a sense, the only reality. It is the primary form of life in the universe. This pattern is the basis of the building blocks of our illusions. And what does it comprise? This amazing, all-pervasive pattern consists of individual parts that function as one. This oneness is achieved by virtue of the nature of the polarities of the individual parts – plus/minus, male/female. Electrons of an atom are like the planets of a solar system. They are oppositely charged (the opposite ‘sex’) to the nucleus of an atom, and they are attracted to each other – just as the planets and sun of a solar system are. The polarised parts flow together in a particular way that is dictated by universal law. The pattern is orbital because of the nature of polarised relationships in space. There is always a centre, a central sphere that gives out energy, and attracts. That central object is surrounded by objects that are attracted to, and attach themselves to, it.

In the case of a solar system, the sun is the centre around which all the planets revolve. In the case of an atom, the centre around which all the electrons revolve is the nucleus. They are the same thing. The momentum of the outer objects (electrons or planets), their speed as they travel through space, becomes a circular movement once they are attracted to and attached to their central object (the sun, a star, or a nucleus). That movement is cyclical. In other words, it keeps orbiting around and around at a certain speed, repeating its cycle in a given period of time, thus creating a vibrational occurrence of cycles per second/day/year/whatever. In the case of the Earth orbiting the sun, it is one cycle per year. In the case of other planets it is faster or slower. In the case of atoms, it is very, very fast – and different for each atom. Taking this a step further, what if everything is orbiting something, which is also orbiting something else? Then all of them function as one. And a complex vibrational pattern exists.

They each link up with all other objects, becoming a part of their flow and one with them. In the entirety of the universe, all things are interconnected as one in this way. And the basis of this is the universal pattern we see exemplified so perfectly in the atom or star systems. It follows and reflects universal law perfectly. This pattern flows in perfect harmony with universal order.

What if this form, this pattern, represents the relationships of beings? What if each atom is a conscious being composed of soulmate beings? What if each solar system is a conscious being composed of soulmate beings (each planet and sun is a being, in and of itself, that together make one being)? What if every being plays two roles, like both parent and child at the same time – surrendering to something, and directing something? What if every star is both in an outflowing, positive polarity, directing position to its planets, but is also like a planet to something else that it orbits? What if the planets take a receptive, negative polarity, surrendering posture to a sun, but function like a sun to something else that orbits it, or is affected by it?

According to the teachings, all of the above is true. Many, many things can be learned and understood by contemplating the above concept. Contemplation of this pattern has guided the understanding of masters, in all matters of universal and earthly life, and thus can also provide the contemplative seeker with profound answers. Truly understanding the meaning of this pattern, and applying it to human life, can provide the deepest understanding of the nature of men and women, and male/female relationships. It is the perfect pattern of the harmonious interaction of polar opposites. Thus, with contemplation, it can show us the way to have perfect relationships, helping us achieve perfectly harmonious interaction with our own soulmates and other humans.

Another issue is the question of equality between men and women. Well there is no equality amongst anybody, other that our souls were very much equal when we were originally individualized (so-called created in the image of the Creator), but since then, because of our different decisions, desires and choices, we now have different Karma, talents and aspirations and therefore are not equal by any stretch of the imagination other than the rights the Universal laws we live under, give us. The opportunities to again become equal to the Creator and all others are still there for all the souls that chose to follow that path.

All Is Vibration. All Vibration Follows Universal Law. All Gives. All Receives. All Loves. All Vibration Seeks its own Level. To find any Level, Set forth the Vibration. By Law you Will Go there, By Law it Will come. Always is there a Greater Vibration. Always is there a Lesser Vibration. In Harmony With Universal Law, All Vibration moves as One Flow, Interrupt the Flow only to Find In This Natural Order thus does it Go, In Forever Passing Through, Divided in Two, Receptivity be the Way of Emptiness, The One calls to Come and Fill, Giving be the Way of Abundance, The One Flows forth to Fill, Always then the Way of the Flow, Dependence on That Which is Above. The Object of Dependence, To that Which is Below, Two will Repel, Two will Attract, Two will Together, Interact, Look then to Four, For All that Need Be, For All Creation, Vibration Be. One. Two. One and Two. Three. One and Two Beget Four. Thus Opens the Infinite Door. Yod He Vau He, Pronounce it Right To Open The Gates of Heaven, And Live in the Light.

1035,"Over the weekend, NASA shared a stunning timelapse of Hague's view from the International Space Station. The video condensed 30 minutes of orbit time around the Earth, going from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, into one beautiful minute. The many clouds visible only added to the awe-inspiring view taken from 254 miles above Earth.

""Took a moment to capture the beauty of our planet today. I was awestruck as I watched the wispy clouds disappear into the shadows,"" Hague tweeted.

Hague launched to the space station on March 14 and will return to Earth in October.

Recently, Hague also had a chance to speak to his son's class.

""I got a chance to speak with my son's class today. Kind of like 'bring you dad to school' day,"" Hague tweeted on May 17. I got a chance to speak with my son's class today.

2,"Minutes before the arrival of Neil Young, a woman and a young boy each carried a fistful of burning sage and waved the smoking embers around a microphone outside the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles. Young was there Friday night to preview his new environmentally conscious album, Earth, for a crowd of fans gathered in a small outdoor amphitheater.

Daylight was fading when Young finally stepped behind the mic, in a fringed leather coat and black fedora, and his words were brief. “As John Lennon would say: Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream,” he said gently.

The 13-track album is a collection of environmental songs from across his career, from “After the Gold Rush” to “The Monsanto Years,” recorded live last year with Promise of the Real. Young has added the sounds of insects and wild animals, giving the music an audience representative of all life on the planet. The nearly 90-minute LP unfolds as a seamless whole, with sounds of birds, primates, whale cries, dogs barking, bear growls and wind flowing from one song to the next. The music covers a range of Young periods and styles, with heaving pipe organ and harmonica on “Mother Earth” and raging guitars on “Seed Justice.” Explosive album closer “Love and Only Love” sprawls out for more than 25 minutes, becoming more of an abstract soundscape than a song by the end, with undulating feedback and cymbal crashes complementing the swelling wildlife sounds.

A more fitting location could not have been picked for the debut of Earth. Towering over Young and the crowd was a giant glass cube displaying the 63-foot-long skeleton of a fin whale, and inside were dinosaur fossils and wildlife panoramas depicting grizzly bears and American buffalo. Rolling Stone spoke with Young at the event and learned five things about Earth.

1. For a hippie pacifist like Young, animals were the perfect collaborators. …

 “I’ve written a lot of songs about the state of the earth and the health of things from my point of view,” Young told RS. “But I never really included all the living things so much as this. And their innocence and the way that you feel when you hear them – it makes you think about them. They’re real, but they don’t have this uptight vibe. They don’t have all the hatred and everything. It’s just not there. That’s a subtle thing.”

2. And they don’t need any help in the studio.

 “It was so fascinating making the record,” Young says. “The sounds of the animals made you feel good. They are all in the right key. They don’t clash with anything. They were perfectly in pitch. We never changed the pitch of any animal. We just left it the way it was and dropped it in. That was really encouraging.”

3. Young plans to keep working with Promise of the Real, who are about to join him on a European tour.

 “They have the flame; they have the knowledge; they have it in their bones and their soul,” he says. “You don’t have to teach them anything. They are in a class all by themselves.”

4. Young makes no apology for writing new protest songs.

“When I write something now like the ‘Monsanto’ song – because you see so much – people question whether you have the right to do that,” he says. “I’ve been doing this for a long time. I played them all on the tour, because I still believe in them.”

5. Earth‘s opening song, “Mother Earth,” was partly inspired by a belt buckle given to Young by a Native American in the early 1970s.

“It said ‘Respect Mother Earth,’ and it was handmade – a big silver plate, and it was obviously banged out by somebody and very soulful. I took the melody from an old hymn and made it a little bit different,” Young explains, calling the song the most direct of any on the record. “It’s the most in your face that this is what the record is about. The rest of it is scenes, but they add up to let you know something and feel. There’s an incredible amount of love on this record, and you can feel that amongst everything. That’s what life is all about.”",mainstream
256,"Researchers believe they have identified the prime driver for a startling rise in the number of people who think the Earth is flat: Google’s video-sharing site, YouTube.

Their suspicion was raised when they attended the world’s largest gatherings of Flat Earthers at the movement’s annual conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 2017, and then in Denver, Colorado, last year.

Interviews with 30 attendees revealed a pattern in the stories people told about how they came to be convinced that the Earth was not a large round rock spinning through space but a large flat disc doing much the same thing.

Of the 30, all but one said they had not considered the Earth to be flat two years ago but changed their minds after watching videos promoting conspiracy theories on YouTube. “The only person who didn’t say this was there with his daughter and his son-in-law and they had seen it on YouTube and told him about it,” said Asheley Landrum, who led the research at Texas Tech University.

The interviews revealed that most had been watching videos about other conspiracies, with alternative takes on 9/11, the Sandy Hook school shooting and whether Nasa really went to the moon, when YouTube offered up Flat Earth videos for them to watch next.

Some said they watched the videos only in order to debunk them but soon found themselves won over by the material.

Landrum said one of the most popular Flat Earth videos, “200 proofs Earth is not a spinning ball” appears to be effective because it offers arguments that appeal to so many mindsets, from biblical literalists and conspiracy theorists to those of a more scientific bent.

One way or another, the interviewees found themselves believers and before long were asking “where is the curve?” and “why is the horizon always at eye level?”

Landrum, who presented her results at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC, said she did not think YouTube was doing anything overtly wrong, but said that if the site wanted to help it could tweak its algorithm to show more accurate information.

“There’s a lot of helpful information on YouTube but also a lot of misinformation,” Landrum said. “Their algorithms make it easy to end up going down the rabbit hole, by presenting information to people who are going to be more susceptible to it.”

“Believing the Earth is flat in of itself is not necessarily harmful, but it comes packaged with a distrust in institutions and authority more generally,” she added. “We want people to be critical consumers of the information they are given, but there is a balance to be had.”

Landrum called on scientists and others to create their own YouTube videos to combat the proliferation of conspiracy videos. “We don’t want YouTube to be full of videos saying here are all these reasons the Earth is flat. We need other videos saying here’s why those reasons aren’t real and here’s a bunch of ways you can research it for yourself.”

But she conceded that some Flat Earthers may not be swayed by a scientists’ words. When the US astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson explained how small sections of large curved surfaces will always appear flat to the little creatures that crawl upon it, his message was seen by some Flat Earthers as patronising and dismissive, Landrum said.

“There’s always going to be a small percentage of people who will reject anything that scientists put out there but maybe there’s a group in the middle that won’t,” she added. “The only tool we have to battle misinformation is to try and overwhelm it with better information.”

489,"Chinese state television had so far only shown a computer-generated image of its path as it approached the surface of the moon late on Saturday.

The 300-pound rover on board the probe separated from the much larger landing vehicle early on Sunday, around seven hours after the Chang'e 3 had touched down on a fairly flat, Earth-facing part of the moon.

The mission blasted off from southwest China on December 2 on a Long March-3B carrier rocket.

The silver rover is named Yutu or Jade Rabbit after the pet of Chang'e, the goddess of the moon in Chinese mythology.

The footage shows the surface of the moon getting closer and closer to the probe before it crashes into the dust.

The video then shows the lander, covered in golden foil, standing in the Sinus Iridum or Bay of Rainbows, its solar panels open to generate power.

The mission marks the next stage in an ambitious space programme that aims to eventually put a Chinese astronaut on the moon.

The rover will spend about three months exploring the moon's surface.

China's space programme is an enormous source of pride for the country, the third to carry out a lunar soft landing - which does not damage the craft and the equipment it carries - after the United States and the former Soviet Union in 1976.",mainstream

I’m pretty good at recognizing themes, so when I needed help on a Monday puzzle, I was really surprised. It turns out that understanding today’s theme by Gary Cee all depends on how you pronounce things.

32A: This is true: The sun or a planet are ORBs. Unless you are a member of the Flat Earth Society.

2D: Hi, kids! Other than Jade, the Extremely Spunky Border terrier, ASTA is the official dog of The New York Times Crossword (he’s been in the crossword a total of 521 times since 1944). “The Thin Man” was a 1934 detective novel by Dashiell Hammett, which was turned into a six part film series starring movie idols William Powell and Myrna Loy. But there was a third member of their detective team named ASTA, the elegant canine sidekick of the elegant 1930s rich couple, Nick and Nora Charles. Offstage, the dog’s name was Skippy, but the wire-haired terrier stole hearts and scenes for his ability to sniff out dead bodies or hidden weapons.

29D: Thought experiment: I wonder if there is an equivalent name for older men who pursue younger women. Or even one for older women who pursue younger women, which is a lot less heteronormative.

872,"On Sunday, April 25, hundreds of thousands of abortion rights supporters gathered in Washington, D.C., for the “March for Women’s Lives.” One rally speaker claimed—with obvious hyperbole—that 41 million people had turned out for the event. Ironically, that is approximately how many American unborn children have lost their lives to abortion since 1973, when the Supreme Court legalized abortion through all nine months of pregnancy.

 Representatives of the United Methodist General Board of Church and Society participate in the ""March for Women's Lives"" in Washington, DC. The April 25 march had a predictable coalition of principal organizers: Planned Parenthood Federation of America (America’s largest abortion provider), NARAL Pro-Choice America, the National Organization for Women, the Feminist Majority, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The large list of official co-sponsors included many interesting groups, such as the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Communist Party USA, the Democratic Socialists of America, the International Socialist Organization, the Green Party of the United States, the Human Rights Campaign (America’s largest homosexual advocacy group), the National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce, Global Goddess, the Ladies' Misbehavior Society, and Bitch magazine. Several religious bodies also offered their unqualified endorsement and financial support to the event, marching side-by-side with their secular counterparts in the abortion rights movement. Among the officially participating denominations were the Episcopal 

 Church, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the United Methodist Church (through the General Board of Church and Society and the Women’s Division of the General Board of Global Ministries), the United Church of Christ (UCC), the American Friends Service Committee, and the Unitarian Universalist Association. Representatives of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church, and the Episcopal Church (U.S.A) marched with official banners from their respective denominations. A sign on the front door of the United Methodist Building on Capitol Hill that day declared that God was speaking through the UCC to support the march. Earlier that morning, the UCC’s political action branch (which is housed in the United Methodist Building) hosted a breakfast for march participants. Another group active in supporting and participating in the march was the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice (RCRC), a pro-abortion political lobby supported by the aforementioned Protestant groups, among others. On the Friday before the main event, RCRC organized an effort to lobby members of Congress after a send-off luncheon in the United Methodist Building. (The luncheon was closed to reporters.) The day before the march, RCRC held a 24-hour “Interfaith Prayer Vigil.” Throughout the day, however, the group was unable to maintain a significant number of people willing to pray for the cause of abortion. At least once, the vigil was reduced to a skeleton crew of one. 

 Immediately before the march’s opening rally, RCRC organized an “Interfaith Worship Service” attended by several hundred enthusiastic, sign-waving activists. Rabbi Balfour Brickner pulled no punches in denouncing abortion opponents as “twisted ideologues” who have “carr[ied] us back into the Middle Ages” and who want to “again teach everybody that the Earth is flat and the sun revolves around it, … who would teach us that the Bible is inerrantly true and not a book of mythology.” Brickner also attacked promoters of pre-marital chastity for “forc[ing] kids into abstinence pledges they and we know they can’t, won’t, and don’t keep.” Other speakers at the service labeled pro-life people as “extremists” and “the forces of oppression.” The Rev. Mark Pawlowski of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) claimed that “God stands with all of us, regardless of where we stand” and that whenever “women choose to have abortions, they are acting with integrity.” The Presbyterian minister did not seem to leave any room for the possibility that some abortions might be immoral, or that God might stand in judgment of these and other sinful acts. Participants in the worship service—which felt more like a rally—also heard from Genie Bank, President of the Women’s Division of the United Methodist Church, and the Rev. Ignacio Castuera, a prominent United Methodist clergyman from California who was recently appointed to be Planned Parenthood’s “chaplain.” There were also speakers from several non-Christian faith traditions. According to the Washington Post, “the dominant themes of the day were two. Again and again, march participants vowed that abortion was here to stay. And that Bush had to go.” 

 Rev. Carlton Veazey of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice The march around Capitol Hill began and ended with a rally on the national Mall in which participants heard from dozens of celebrities and veteran activists, including the Rev. Katherine Ragsdale, an Episcopal priest, and the Rev. Carlton Veazey, head of RCRC. The latter claimed to speak for the members of all the RCRC-endorsing denominations and alleged that pro-life people not only oppose abortion rights but “are trying to roll back every right!” Another activist told the cheering crowd that the rally site was “sacred space” and that “this is the place to be on Sunday morning—not the churches!” Many of the speakers made the odd and ironic assertion that it was not for themselves but “for the children” that they were defending abortion. Those not in attendance will have little idea of the amount of extreme vulgarity evident in the signs and slogans of the demonstrators, as well as in some official speeches from the podium. Respectable sources, including the IRD, are unable to print or broadcast the many lewd references to female anatomy and sexual acts. The event had an unmistakably partisan tone. Many of the official speakers made explicit exhortations urging the crowd to “put a Democrat in the White House”—in the words of actress Linda Carter—and “to elect John Kerry”—in the words of Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY). The roster of featured speakers included fourteen members of Congress, all of whom were Democrats. The agenda of the event clearly went far beyond what even many “pro-choice” Americans believe, as countless speakers denounced the federal ban on partial-birth abortions, called for increased taxpayer funds for abortion, and attacked laws requiring minor girls to notify their parents before undergoing abortion surgery. They also resorted to name-calling, denouncing pro-life people as “cowards,” “peckerwood anti-choice fanatics,” and people “who have no shame,” among many other epithets. (“Peckerwood” is a derogatory term for a rural white southerner.) While speaker after speaker claimed that “most Americans support us,” a Zogby poll taken one week before the march revealed that 49 percent of Americans self-identify as “pro-life” while only 45 percent self-identify as “pro-choice.” Furthermore, 70 percent of Americans oppose partial-birth abortion, according to a CNN poll from January 2003. During the course of the march, hundreds of peaceful pro-life counter-protestors endured a steady stream of hurled curses, hateful shouts, and even an occasional projectile (including black ink, spit, Planned Parenthood condoms with crude jokes on them, an egg, and a flier picturing Jesus and reading: “Save Lives / Abort Christ”). The main pro-life groups represented were American Collegians for Life; Silent No More (a Christian ministry of and for post-abortive women); Feminists for Life; an African-American evangelical group called the Life, Education and Resource Network (LEARN), and Operation Witness. The pro-choice marchers reserved some of their most energetic shouts and confrontations for the Silent No More women quietly holding signs that said, simply, “I Regret My Abortion.” At one point a march participant pointed to an RCRC sign and mockingly yelled to some pro-life counter-protesters, “Jesus is with us!”",conspiracy
243,"It’s been proven to be round for years, yet many people still believe that Earth is flat.

These so-called ‘Flat Earthers’ have come up with a range of weird and wonderful theories, in the hopes of proving that our planet isn’t spherical.

Now, a hilarious error has seen Google Translate accidentally troll these believers.

A user on Reddit discovered that if you ask Google Translate to translate the sentence ‘I am a Flat Earther' from English to French, the system will respond with ‘Je suis un fou.'

French speakers among you will know that this translates back into English as ‘I’m a crazy person.’

They said: “Translate works by learning patterns from many millions of examples of translations seen out on the web.

“Unfortunately, some of those patterns can lead to incorrect translations. The error has been reported and we are working on a fix.”

mirror.co.uk has checked, and it appears the error is still in place, and the translation is still there.

454,"When we hear a myth about the creation of the world for the first time, it helps to reflect on a period when our earliest ancestors were searching for answers about things they could not explain. The explanations they came up with, about the soul and about nature, originate in similar kinds of meditations, regardless of the geographical region or historical era. Eventually these ideas were expressed in myths and legends. By studying them, we can reveal the common roots of our humanity.

Long before contemporary scientific and psychological thought, there was aboriginal thought, a mode of thinking that was, and still is, comfortable, even intimate, with myth. Such thinking proceeds from the original, natural mind. It is an outcome of a special, nearly extinct, way of life. In one sense, this type of thinking may be considered unsophisticated and even primitive. In another sense, though, aboriginal thought is a powerful tool. It is a way of deriving conclusions that is simple, direct, and uncluttered by systems of logic and vast vocabularies.

Knowing something about the way of life that gives rise to original thought is important because this knowledge allows us to rediscover facets of ourselves that have been neglected and forgotten.

When the Chinese creation myth is heard for the first time, we see in it a story similar to that told in the Bible, in the Book of Genesis. We also see a tendency in Chinese thought to express concepts in terms of essential components. The primal forces of the masculine and feminine, of the yang and the yin and their permutations, are emphasized. This ability to express abstract ideas in a direct manner is never really abandoned throughout the entire history of Chinese philosophical thought.

Rather than beginning this book with a hefty philosophical account, it is more appropriate to extend an invitation. In a sense, a myth is a kind of invitation. A myth is like a greeting, and it contains a message from the past, offered to the present. Myths introduce us to a particular part, however small, of the prehistory of a civilization.

The Myth of Pan Ku: Creation and the Universal Egg

In the beginning of time, there was only chaos. The elements and gases of the heavens and earth freely mingled, and the organizing principle was dormant. It lay dormant somewhere inside this elemental cosmos, awaiting the right moment to begin the transformation. The shape of this primeval mass was something like an egg.

For 18,000 years the universe remained in this state, until the incubation was finally complete, and the egg hatched. Then the heavens and the earth came into existence. The lighter, most pure substances floated upward and became the heavens. These elements were named yang. The heavier, more impure substances descended and became the earth. These were named yin.

From the same forces, a third, the giant Pan Ku, was born as well. As he grew, his sheer size divided the heavens and the earth. The giant lived for another 18,000 years. With the assistance of four creatures, a tortoise, a phoenix, a dragon, and a unicorn, he labored daily to mold the earth. Together they created the world as we know it today.

When Pan Ku finally died, his body was transformed. His left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. His blood became the rivers and oceans, his breath became the wind, his sweat became the rain, and his voice became the thunder. His flesh became the soil, and from the fleas living on his body, the human race sprang into being. In this way, the stage was set for the pageant of history to unfold.

The story of Pan Ku is the Chinese myth of creation. The ancient myths of creation from virtually all cultures show that at the root of human experience is the belief that our world has an organizing principle. After this creative force appears, everything else takes the form of opposing forces: heaven and earth, black and white, day and night, good and evil. These are the ideas of the yang and the yin, of the masculine and feminine. These opposing qualities are, by their fundamental natures, equal in all respects but forever separate entities.

Here we see the theme of the One giving rise to the two in the order of creation, and of a creator who, like Pan Ku, works with primordial substances to bring an entire world into being. This theme will expanded upon in the next section as we discuss the connection between Taoism and nature.

189,"Prototype designs for a proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border could be built in June, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said recently.

While CBP officials would not say how many companies had responded to Friday's formal request for wall designs, published reports said a number of large firms with significant experience in managing large projects had expressed interest. The request for plans covered both a concrete wall and one using other materials, like fencing.

Meanwhile, a small company thousands of kilometers away from the border is working with firms that design and build projects in the hope of landing some business from the multi-billion-dollar proposal.

Riverdale Mills in Northbridge, Massachusetts, already has supplied tall, high-security fencing that guards 43 kilometers of the 3,000-kilometer border.

In a VOA interview, Riverdale CEO Jim Knott said his factory can make steel fence with small openings that make climbing or cutting the structure very difficult. If the joint proposal is accepted, he said, his company can turn out specialized fencing quickly and could expand production with new machinery and employees if necessary.

Building a wall to keep illegal immigrants out of the United States was a key promise Donald Trump made as a presidential candidate. Approximately one-third of the border already has an assortment of fences or walls. However, many areas, particularly in remote, thinly populated regions, lack such structures.

The new wall is generally supposed to be 9 meters tall, block tunneling efforts nearly 2 meters below ground and be ""esthetically pleasing"" from the U.S. side. The specifications also call for gates that can admit vehicles, and for the structure to be able to withstand at least an hour of efforts to break through it with sledgehammers, welding torches and other common tools. Estimates of the cost to build the wall range from $8 billion to more than $20 billion.

Critics of the wall project express concern about its cost, say it could hurt commerce in the border areas of the United States and cause environmental problems. Critics also say that many people who are in the United States illegally arrived by plane legally and then overstayed their visas, a problem that would not be addressed by a wall.

159,"Although people long ago began to wonder whether the “canals” on Mars were the creation of cosmic engineers, for some odd reason it has not occurred to look with the same eyes upon the peculiarities of the lunar landscape much closer at hand.

And all the arguments about the possibilities of intelligent life existing on other celestial bodies have been confined to the idea that other civilizations must necessarily live on the surface of a planet, and that the interior as a habitat is out of the question.

Abandoning the traditional paths of “common sense”, we have plunged into what may at first sight seem to be unbridled and irresponsible fantasy.

But the more minutely we go into all the information gathered by man about the Moon, the more we are convinced that there is not a single fact to rule out our supposition.

Not only that, but many things so far considered to be lunar enigmas are explainable in the light of this new hypothesis.

AN ARTIFICIAL SPUTNIK OF THE EARTH?

The origin of the Moon is one of the most complicated problems of cosmogony. So far there have been basically three hypotheses under discussion.

HYPOTHESIS I: The Moon was once a part of the Earth and broke away from it. This has now been refuted by the evidence.

HYPOTHESIS II: The Moon was formed independently from the same cloud of dust and gas as the Earth, and immediately became the Earth’s natural satellite.

But then why is there such a big difference between the specific gravity of the Moon (3.33 grams per cubic centimeter) and that of the Earth (5.5 gr.)?

Furthermore, according to the latest information (analysis of samples brought back by the U.S. Apollo astronauts) lunar rock is not of the same composition as the Earth’s.

HYPOTHESIS III: The Moon came into being separately, and, moreover, far from the Earth (perhaps even outside the Solar system).

This would mean that the moon would not have to be fashioned from the same “clay” as our own planet.

Sailing through the Universe, the Moon came into Earth’s proximity, and by a complex interplay of forces of gravity was brought within a geocentric orbit, very close to circular.

But a catch of this kind is virtually impossible.

In fact, scientists studying the origin of the Universe today have no acceptable theory to explain how the Earth-Moon system came into being.

OUR HYPOTHESIS: The Moon is an artificial Earth satellite put into orbit around the Earth by some intelligent beings unknown to ourselves.

We refuse to engage in speculation about who exactly staged this unique experiment, which only a highly developed civilization was capable of.

If you are going to launch an artificial sputnik, then it is advisable to make it hollow.

At the same time it would be naive to imagine that anyone capable of such a tremendous space project would be satisfied simply with some kind of giant empty trunk hurled into a near-Earth trajectory.

It is more likely that what we have here is a very ancient spaceship, the interior of which was filled with fuel for the engines, materials and appliances for repair work, navigation, instruments, observation equipment and all manner of machinery…

In other words, everything necessary to enable this “caravelle of the Universe” to serve as a kind of Noah’s Ark of intelligence, perhaps even as the home of a whole civilization envisaging a prolonged (thousands of millions of years) existence and long wanderings through space (thousands of millions of miles).

Naturally, the hull of such a spaceship must be super-tough in order to stand up to the blows of meteorites and sharp fluctuations between extreme heat and extreme cold.

Probably the shell is a double-layered affair – the basis a dense armoring of about 20 miles in thickness, and outside it some kind of more loosely packed covering (a thinner layer – averaging about three miles).

In certain areas where the lunar “seas” and “craters” are, the upper layer is quite thin, in some cases, non-existent.

Since the Moon’s diameter is 2,162 miles, then looked at from our point of view it is a thin – walled sphere. And, understandably, not an empty one.

There could be all kinds of materials and equipment on its inner surface. But the greatest proportion of the lunar mass is concentrated in the central part of the sphere, in its core, which has a diameter of 2,062 miles.

Thus the distance between the kernel and the shell of this nut is in the region of 30 miles.

This space was doubtless filled with gases required for breathing, and for technological and other purposes.

With such an internal structure the Moon could have an average specific gravity if 3.3 grams per cubic centimeter, which differs considerably from that of Earth (5.5 grams per cubic centimeter).

The most numerous and interesting of the formations on the lunar surface are the craters.

In diameter they vary considerably. Some are less that a yard across, while others are more than 120 miles (the biggest has a diameter of 148 miles). How does the Moon come to be so pockmarked?

There are two hypothesis – volcanic and meteoric. Most scientists vote for the latter.

Kirill Stanyukovich, a Soviet physicist, has written a whole series of works since 1937 in which he expounds the idea that the craters are the result of bombardment of the Moon for millions of years.

And he really means bombardment, for even the smallest celestial body, when it is involved in one of those fastest head-on collisions so common in the cosmos behaves itself like a warhead charged with dynamite, or even an atomic warhead at times.

Instant combustion takes place on impact, turning it into a dense cloud of incandescent gas, into plasma, and there is a very definite explosion.

According to Professor Stanyukovich, a “missile” of a sizable character (say 6 miles in diameter) must, on collision with the Moon, penetrate to a depth equal to 4 or 5 times its own diameter (24-30 miles).

The surprising thing is that however big the meteorites may have been which have fallen on the Moon (some have been more than 60 miles in diameter), and however fast they must have been travelling (in some cases the combined speed was as much as 38 miles per second), the craters they have left behind are for some odd reason all about the same depth, 1.2-2 miles, although they vary tremendously in diameter.

Take that 148-mile diameter crater. In area it outdoes Hiroshima hundreds of times over.

What a powerful explosion it must have been to send millions of tons of lunar rock fountaining over tens of miles!

On the face of it, one would expect to find a very deep crater here, but nothing of the sort: there is three miles at the most between top and bottom levels, and one third of that is accounted for by the wall of rock thrown up around the crater like a toothed crown.

For such a big hole, it is too shallow. Furthermore, the bottom of the crater is convex, following the curve of the lunar surface.

If you were to stand in the middle of the crater you would not even be able to see the soaring edge — it would be beyond the horizon. A hollow that is more like a hill is a rather strange affair, perhaps.

Not really, if one assumes that when the meteorite strikes the outer covering of the moon, this plays the role of a buffer and the foreign body finds itself up against an impenetrable spherical barrier.

Only slightly denting the 20-mile layer of armour plating, the explosion flings bits of its “coating” far and wide.

Bearing in mind that the Moon’s defense coating is, according to our calculations, 2.5 miles thick, one sees that this is approximately the maximum depth of the craters.

Now let us consider the chemical peculiarities of the lunar rock.

Upon analysis, American scientists have found chromium, titanium and zirconium in it. These are all metals with refractory, mechanically strong and anti-corrosive properties.

A combination of them all would have enviable resistance to heat and the ability to stand up to means of aggression, and could be used on Earth for linings for electrical furnaces.

If a material had to be devised to protect a giant artificial satellite from the unfavorable effects of temperature, from cosmic radiation and meteorite bombardment, the experts would probably have hit on precisely these metals.

In that case it is not clear why lunar rock is such an extraordinarily poor heat conductor – a factor which so amazed the astronauts?

Wasn’t that what the designers of the super-sputnik of the Earth were after?

From the engineers point of view, this spaceship of ages long past which we call the Moon is superbly constructed. There may be a good reason for its extreme longevity.

It is even possible that it predates our own planet.

At any rate, some pieces of lunar rock have proved older than the oldest on Earth, although it is true, this applies to the age of the materials and not of the structure for which they were used.

And from the number of craters on its surface, the Moon itself is no chicken.

It is, of course, difficult to say when it began to shine in the sky above the Earth, but on the basis of some preliminary estimates one might hazard a guess that it was around two thousand million years ago.

We do not, of course, imagine that the moon is still inhabited, and probably many of its automatic devices have stopped working, too.

The stabilizers have ceased functioning and the poles have shifted.

Even though the moon keeps that same side turned towards us, for some time it has been unsteady on its own axis, on occasion showing us part of its reverse side which were once invisible to observers on the Earth – for example, the Selenites themselves if they made expeditions here.

Time has taken its toll. Both body and rigging have disintegrated to some extent; some seams on the inner shell evidently diverged.

We assume that the long (up to 940 miles) chains of small craters formerly ascribed to volcanic activity were brought about by eruptions of gas through cracks appearing in the armour plating as a result of accidents.

No doubt one of the most splendid features of the lunarscape – a straight “wall” nearly 500 yards high and over 60 miles long – formed as a result of one of the armor plates bending under the impact of celestial torpedoes and raising one of its straight, even edges.

The Moon’s population presumably took the necessary steps to remedy the effects of meteorite bombardment, for example, patching up rents in the outer shield covering the inner shell.

For such purposes a substance from the lunar core was probably used, a kind a cement being made from it.

After processing this would be piped to the surface sites where it was required.

Not long ago astronomers discovered variations in the gravitational fields near the large “seas”.

We believe the reason to be this: the Moon’s dry seas are in fact areas from which the protective coating was torn from the armor cladding.

To make good the damage to these vast tracts, the installation producing the repair substance would have had to be brought immediately beneath the site so that it could flood the area with its “cement”.

The resulting flat stretches are what look like seas to the terrestrial observer.

The stocks of materials and machinery for doing this are no doubt still where they were, and are sufficiently massive to give rise to these gravitational anomalies.

What is the Moon today? Is it a colossal necropolis, a “city of the dead,” where some form of life became extinct?

Is it a kind cosmic Flying Dutchman? A craft abandoned by its crew and controlled automatically?

We do not know and we shall not try to guess.

We have put forward in this article only a few of the reasons – unfortunately the evidence is so far only circumstantial – for our hypothesis, which at first glance may appear to be crazy.

A similar “crazy” idea was put forward in 1959 by Professor Iosif Shklovsky, an eminent scientist, in relation to the “moons” circling around Mars.

After carefully weighing up the evidence he concludes that they are both hollow and therefore artificial satellites.

We feel that the questions we have raised in connection with our Moon provide sufficient food for serious thought on the matter; the result may be the illumination of our many lunar riddles.

Now, of course, we have to wait for direct evidence to support our idea. Or refute it…

Probably there will not be long to wait.

1037,"a) Landcover - Natural Earth landcover derives primarily from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF), a 500-meter resolution product of the University Maryland, Global Land Cover Facility. NASA's Terra satellite collects the raw data from which MODIS VCF derives.

MODIS VCF is comprised of three data channels, forest, herbaceous, and bare. Assigning flat colors (dark green for forest, light green for herbaceous, and gray for bare) to these channels, which blend into one another, creates an image of Earth that appears natural. To give the bare channel more visual interest (i.e. tonal modulation), a lightened and recolorized version of NASA's Blue Marble image substitutes for flat gray in desert and highland areas, which appear reddish-brown and gray-blue respectively.

For a full discussion of natural-color mapping techniques refer to this article [http://www.shadedrelief.com/shelton/].

Other data used in Natural Earth include:

b) Shaded relief - Downsampled SRTM30 with void-filling enhancements by Natural Graphics, except for Antarctica which derives from GTOPO30.

c) Bathymetry - ETOPO2 obtained from NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center website. Note: only the downsampled (10,800 x 5,400) version of Natural Earth uses bathymetry.

d) Glaciers and Antarctic ice shelves - Digital Chart of the World (DCW) 1:1,000,000-scale vector data originally developed by the US National Geospatial Agency (formerly DMA and, more recently, NIMA). Antarctic ice tones derive from Blue Marble. Greenland ice tones are blue-tinted shaded relief.

e) Arctic pack ice - Digitized from the CIA's Polar Regions Atlas, 1978, page 12. The stylized ice boundary depicts estimated absolute minimum sea ice extent, a theoretical concept rather than an observable geographic location. Use the pack ice overlay only for small-scale and generalized map presentations.

f) Seas, lakes, and rivers - Extracted from MODIS VCF. The eastern one-third of Iceland, arctic areas north of 80 degrees, all of Antarctica, and many mid-ocean islands are not included in the dataset. The water boundary accompanying GTOPO30 elevation data substitutes in the areas not covered by MODIS VCF.

g) International boundaries - ESRI Shapefile provided by the Office of the Geographer, US Department of State. Boundary representation is not necessarily authoritative.

h) AVHRR urban - Extracted from 1-kilometer resolution Global Land Cover Characteristics Data Base Version 2.0 distributed by the USGS.

i) MODIS urban - Extracted from 1-kilometer resolution Binary MOD12Q1 data (a MODIS-based product) obtained from Boston University, Department of Geography.

Of the nearly 525 million pixels that comprise Natural Earth, not all are perfect. Although created from satellite data, Natural Earth is a derivative graphical product that includes manual touchups. Use it accordingly.

The following are potential areas of concern for users.

a) Incomplete MODIS VCF landcover coverage - The eastern one-third of Iceland, arctic areas north of 80 degrees, all of Antarctica, and numerous ocean islands including Hawaii, Vanua Levu (Fiji), and the Shetland and Faroe Islands are missing from the data set.

b) Filling the voids in MODIS VCF landcover involved several methods. Polar areas where little vegetation grows were the easiest to manage. Working backward from water and glacier coverages obtained from other sources, all unglaciated terrestrial areas received a bare classification and gray coloration. For eastern Iceland, where measurable vegetation exists, Binary MOD12Q1 landcover substituted for the missing MODIS VCF to show the herbaceous tundra as a pale green tint.

c) Coloring small oceanic islands (most are only a few pixels wide) involved cloning landcover colors from nearby land areas with similar climate and vegetation characteristics. Manual painting in Photoshop using printed vegetation maps as a guide further enhanced the larger Hawaiian Islands.

d) Discolored pixels - Pixels with unexpected colors (typically red-brown and gray) fringe some ocean shorelines and interior water bodies that fluctuate in size, a by-product of merging MODIS VCF and Blue Marble datasets. Filtering and manual cloning with the Clone Tool (rubber stamp) in Photoshop eliminated most of the discoloration.

e) Snow removal - Another unwanted by-product of merged MODIS VCF and Blue Marble data was the appearance of patchy snow in the southern Andes and adjacent Patagonia between 35 and 45 degrees south latitude. Natural Earth depicts glaciers but not temporary snow cover. Sampling landcover colors from adjacent areas free of snow and painting in Photoshop removed the snow. The dramatic shaded relief of the Andes largely obscures this fix.

f) Ghosted shaded relief - The Blue Marble image contains embedded shaded relief. In desert and highland areas on Natural Earth, a faint impression of the shaded relief is visible where recolorized and lightened Blue Marble contributes to the landcover.

g) Polar areas - Reflecting the accuracy of the global datasets from which it derives, the resolution and general quality of data in polar regions on Natural Earth is less than that of other areas of the world.

h) Water - Only the largest rivers appear on the water layer provided with Natural Earth, discontinuously. The Aral Sea, Lake Chad, and Great Salt Lake look too large.",mainstream
102,"People look for usable clothing among rubble in the Petobo neighborhood which was hit by an earthquake and liquefaction in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, October 8, 2018.

When the violent shaking from a massive magnitude 7.5 earthquake finally stopped, Selvi Susanti stood up and realized something strange was happening. First, she saw the ground suddenly begin to sink. Then the pavement split beneath her feet like a broken dinner plate and started to rise.

Terrified, she clung to a small sliver of asphalt and surfed a river of fast-moving mud as it swallowed entire neighborhoods, carrying her higher than coconut trees for a quarter of a mile.

""What I saw — oh my God! Houses were tumbling. They started to roll like waves. It's like a tsunami, but the difference was they were waves of soil,"" said Susanti, 38, weeping at the memory of seeing so many people simply disappear into the earth as they screamed for help. ""It felt like I was in a boat, moving around. But the difference is I was not in water, but in the mud.""

Many, like Susanti in the devastated village of Petobo, had no idea they were in an area already identified by the government as a high-risk zone for the devastating geological phenomenon that causes soft ground to liquefy during earthquakes.

But Indonesian scientist Gegar Prasetya wasn't surprised by any of the events that occurred at dusk on Sept. 28, killing nearly 2,000 people and leaving possibly thousands more missing. He had warned people for years that the area around Sulawesi island's Palu Bay had been struck before and was due for another potential combination of factors to create a perfect storm capable of unleashing earthquakes, landslides, tsunami waves and soil liquefaction.

""I knew right away,"" said Prasetya, co-founder of the Tsunami Research Center Indonesia, who had met with government officials and residents in the area to try to raise awareness about the threat. ""I posted in our group, and I said, 'It's happened.'""

Disaster-prone Indonesia, part of the Pacific Basin's ""Ring of Fire,"" is an archipelago of about 17,000 islands sitting atop numerous fault lines that have produced some of the largest and most deadly earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions in recorded history.

Other scientists around the world wondered how this type of earthquake — on a strike-slip fault, which typically does not produce dangerous tsunamis — could generate waves that surged as high as 6 meters (20 feet).

He had published a paper nearly two decades ago highlighting six other tsunamis recorded in the Makassar Strait in the past century, predicting that a repeat event could be expected roughly every 25 years. The last one occurred in a region north of the city in 1996. Before that, Palu Bay was hit in 1968 by a very similar magnitude 7.4 quake that generated waves 10 meters (33 feet) high.

""This one complete village went to the sea,"" he said of the 1968 event. ""You can still see the trees from the top of the water.""

Some experts theorize that the Sept. 28 quake, by itself, didn't generate a big wave despite being shallow and near the coast. They're convinced it was instead the area's soft soil that served as the real catalyst for disaster. The temblor's long, violent shaking likely triggered one or more underwater landslides due to unstable sediment deposited on the seafloor by rivers. This disruptive movement may have created the large wall of water that raced across the open ocean until being squeezed into the long, narrow bay that surrounds Palu, forcing the wave to grow higher.

""Imagine what happens if you drop a brick in a flat pond — ripples spread in all directions,"" said Robert Hall, a geologist at Royal Holloway University of London, who has studied the area. ""Now drop the same size object in a bathtub. The waves can reflect off the sides, can amplify, and may get larger in the direction of the length of the bath.""

But it wasn't just weak sediment in the ocean that gave way. Wet, sandy soil also separated and came alive through liquefaction in some areas due to the earthquake's radical vibrations. The ground simply lost its strength and turned to mush beneath people's feet, creating mud that acted like quicksand. People, houses, cars and streets were swallowed and covered by a thick carpet of what — just seconds earlier — had been solid earth. Fast-moving landslides also were launched above ground, possibly causing even more localized tsunami waves.

""We wouldn't necessarily expect to get all the worst possible factors occurring together,"" said Willem De Lange, a scientist from the University of Waikato in New Zealand who co-authored research on the area with Prasetya in 2001. ""Unfortunately this does happen.""

Many questions remain about exactly what happened in this complex disaster. Prasetya will begin field work with the Indonesian navy this week to try to better understand what occurred under water, and a team of international experts are expected to arrive next month to carry out an assessment.

Palu's population has exploded in many high-risk areas since the 1968 event, which killed 200 people and also turned soil to mud in places, leaving many newcomers vulnerable with no local history.

However, the central government did produce a map in 2012 identifying large swaths of Palu, a city of 380,000 people, where liquefaction could occur. The area of Petobo, for instance, was classified as having high-risk potential. The report also recommended that housing and industrial areas should best be built in areas with low liquefaction risk. It suggested mitigation efforts, including building structures with deep foundations anchored into firmer layers of earth.

Good urban planning is ultimately the key to saving lives, said Sri Hidayati, head of earthquake mitigation at the Energy Ministry's Geology Agency, which produced the report that was shared with the provincial and district governments in Sulawesi. She said it's her agency's responsibility to provide the mapping, but it's up to local authorities to ""use it or not."" Calls Monday to Palu's vice mayor and the mayor's aid went unanswered.

""If everything in the future is planned based on this, I think maybe we will only experience a small number of casualties in case such a disaster occurs again,"" she said. ""Or probably no casualties at all.""

At a news conference in Jakarta on Monday, the head of the country's disaster agency also confirmed that soft soil areas in Palu are not fit for housing.

""It is impossible to rebuild in areas with high liquefaction risk such as Petobo and Balaroa,"" he said, adding that people still living there will be relocated.

Indonesia has been criticized for lifting the tsunami warning it issued for Sulawesi's coast too soon. The earthquake knocked out power and telecommunication towers, meaning sirens didn't wail and alerts didn't light up mobile phones. Online video showed an unsettling scene as cars and motorbikes drove at normal speeds on a coastal road and oblivious people milled about on the beach while the large, fast-moving wave could be seen racing closer before exploding onshore.

""It's almost impossible for a tsunami warning system to predict what we saw the other day,"" said Adam Switzer, a tsunami expert at the Earth Observatory of Singapore. ""The earthquake is the warning. If you're anywhere in southeast Asia and you're on the coast and you feel an earthquake, move inland and move to higher ground and stay there.""

But it's also not a matter of only warning people just before something happens. Prasetya said the history and geology of Palu Bay must be considered in plans to rebuild. He said soil investigations should be carried out to determine if deep piles are needed to stabilize buildings. Local knowledge should also be considered as a cheap way to save lives, such as constructing houses out of wood with thatched roofs, instead of concrete and tile.

In Petobo, tsunami warnings would not have helped because there was no time to respond. All that remains of the village, located about 30 minutes from the center of Palu, is a muddy wasteland where only the very tips of roofs remain above ground in places. Satellite images show a heavily populated area stretching more than 100 hectares (250 acres) being devoured by what looks like a giant layer of chocolate milk. In mobile phone videos, buildings are seen sliding like pucks across a slab of ice. Some people spent hours trying to find their homes after the disaster, locating them about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from where they once stood.

""It felt like we were spinning in a blender,"" recalled Susanti, who survived by leaping to solid ground and running after the mud flow finally slowed down. ""I saw houses change position. Houses which were located at the east moved to the west and vice versa. I saw the twisted mud was shaped like dough.""

Recovering bodies from Petobo and other hard-hit areas, such as Balaroa, has been difficult because heavy equipment will sink in the soft soil and is unusable there. The government is considering turning some of these sites into mass graves, according to Wiranto, Indonesia's security minister, who uses one name.

""It is already a ghost village. I will not go back there even if they pay me 1 billion rupiah ($65,800),"" said Erli Yati, 32, who also survived what's been dubbed a ""land tsunami"" by some in Petobo.

She had no idea about the previous disasters there or that the ground could come alive as it did.

""I will not step back to that place again,"" she added. ""That was the worse experience I have ever had.""

Prasetya commended the idea of closing off liquefaction areas and said mitigation — whether it's creating and enforcing proper building codes in at-risk zones or relocating people to safer places — should be implemented before the next disaster.

""How many souls need to be sacrificed until the government knows mitigation is important?"" he asked, adding he's been sounding alarms since the massive 2004 earthquake-spawned tsunami off Sumatra island killed 230,000 people in a dozen nations, more than half of them in Indonesia. ""Everything is back to business as usual.""",mainstream

238,"The Flat Earth model is a conspiracy theory on the concept that the Earth is a flat, disc-shaped plane. Many ancient cultures subscribed to the idea but it was made famous again in modern times thanks to the creation of a Flat Earth society by Samuel Shenton in 1956. Mark Sargent, an avid member of the widely discredited club and author of several books on the topic, detailed during a new documentary the moment he brought into the wacky conspiracy.

He revealed during Netflix’s “Behind the Curve”, how he came across a video of a man who claimed to have worked for NASA. Mr Sargent said: “There was a video, a guy talking about flight paths in the southern hemisphere and how they didn’t make sense. “Then I stumbled across a video by Matt Boylan – he was a contract artist for NASA. “At a high-level NASA party, they told him the GPS system doesn’t work out in Antarctica because the world is flat.

“They all started laughing and watching him to see how he would take it.” Mr Sargent went on to reveal how he was sceptical of the bizarre claim at first, but somehow found it hard to disprove later on. He then picked up his Flat Earth model and stated: “This is what it is. “What do you think your first reaction is going to be? “Bull****, no way – if you don’t make fun of this the first time you see it, there’s probably something wrong with you.

“I became a Flat Earther because I tried to debunk the theory.” Despite Mr Sargent’s claims, the GPS signal does work on both of the Earth’s poles. However, because of the orbital geometry, it can take a while to get an accurate altitude calculation. Shockingly, this is arguably not Mr Sargent’s most unusual claim. During the same series, he showed how the Flat Earth Society is “winning against science”.

Taking the production crew to a beach near his home, Mr Sargent pointed at the city of Seattle across the water. He said: “Here’s an example if you want to see it real quick. “So like the buildings in the distance – right out there – that is Seattle. “You should not be able to see it. “There should be hundreds of feet of curvature between us and them.”",mainstream

 Greek Astronomy
• Daily motion around the celestial poles (rising and setting).
• Eastward motion along the Ecliptic over a year
• The seasons are of unequal length - the Sun moves a little faster in winter, slower in summer.
• Eastward motion near the Ecliptic over a month.
• Generally eastward motion near the Ecliptic at different speeds for each planet.

Any successful description of the Solar System must explain all these facts.

Among the first Greek philosophers to suggest a geocentric system:
• Earth was a flat disk (cylinder) fixed and unmoving at the center.
• Sun, Moon & Stars were affixed to rotating crystalline spheres centered on the Earth.

Philosopher & Mathematician, founded the Pythagorean school. Taught that spheres are the perfect geometric shapes.

• Meant Sun was 5x bigger than the Earth (more like 109x, again, sound method but inadequate data).
• Makes it even more absurd that the Sun should move, if the Earth was too large to move according to Aristotle.

We know none of the details of Aristarchus' Heliocentric model. We only have his treatise on the distances and sizes of the Moon and the Sun, from which we gather what his motivations might have been. We know of his Heliocentric model only from mention of it (usually dismissive) by others who came after him. Our primary surviving source is the of Archimedes.

The heliocentric picutre never caught on, perhaps because it was considered too radical given deeply ingrained notions about uniform circular motion and the immobility of the Earth.
• Discovered the Precession of the Equinoxes
• Introduced the Babylonian angular notation of 360° in a circle.
• Introduced epicycles, building on ideas of Apollonius of Perga.

The main circle is the Deferent, to which is afixed a second, smaller circle called the Epicycle (""on the circle"" in Greek), to which the planet is affixed. The two circles rotate counterclockwise at different rates fine-tuned to make the apparent motions as seen from the Earth come out right. Additional epicycles can be added to further fine-tune the system. Notice that the Earth is not exactly at the center of the Deferent, but slightly offset at the ""eccentric"" point.
• Superior planets are brighter at opposition, when moving retrograde.
• Placing the Earth at an eccentric away from the deferent center helps explain the observed non-uniform motions of the Sun, Moon, and Planets.
• Can fine-tune the model by adding epicycles

What distinguishes Hipparchus' geocentric model from all previous models is that it was firmly grounded in observational data, many observations of which he made himself (by all accounts Hipparchus was the supreme observational astronomer of the classical period). In many ways, this work marks a turning point between models motivated primarily by philosophical aesthetics and models based at least in part upon observational data. Hipparchus still sought to preserve appearances, and chose a reasonable (to him) geometric model to represent planetary motions mathematically.

1066,"The idea that the Earth is flat is nothing new, but the conspiracy theory seems to have gained a bit of extra momentum in recent weeks.

One man was so convinced, he attempted to build a rocket in his back yard and prove it once and for all.

But Elon Musk - who knows more than a thing or two about rockets - has posed the obvious question: if Earth is flat, does that mean other planets are as well?

The billionaire posted a tweet asking why there was no Flat Mars Society - taking a swipe at the Flat Earth Society which continues to peddle the idea that our planet resembles a pancake.

The group took the jibe in its stride and posted a reply. Apparently in all seriousness that the Earth is not a sphere.

In fact, the conspiracy theory may be more popular than people give it credit for. In November, hundreds of people attended the first Flat Earth International Conference in North Carolina, USA.

They believe that NASA, along with the world's governments are covering up the fact that Earth is actually just a disc hanging suspended in space.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk is making it his life's work to colonise Mars and turn humankind into a multi-planetary species.

The billionaire has always said that putting humans on the Red Planet is the ultimate aim of his private space company SpaceX.

But besides just getting there, Musk says he wants to set up cities so we can live there permanently. Previously, he suggested that nuking the planet might be the quickest way to make it habitable .

Despite this, he still said that Mars is our only real option - discounting the likes of Jupiter's moon Europa or other planets like Venus.",mainstream
270,"THE oldest crater on Earth has been precisely dated and scientists think the impact could have changed the world's climate.

Western Australia's Yarrabubba crater is now thought to be 200 million years older than the next oldest crater on Earth.

Researchers re-dated the site with new technological methods.

They measured the age of shocked minerals within the crater and determined it was created by a meteorite 2.23billion years ago.

This would make it around half the age of our 4.5billion-year-old Earth.

The crater has long been regarded as one of Earth's oldest but a precise age was unknown until now.

Dating craters can be very difficult due to changes in the Earth's surface over time.

The research team thinks the meteor struck at a time when glaciers were forming all over the Earth and Australia was largely covered in ice.

Simulations have indicated that the meteorite hit a continental ice sheet and threw 5,000 trillion kilograms of water vapour into the atmosphere.

The scientists note that such an impact would have drastically changed the Earth's climate and may have even caused a greenhouse effect period known as ""Snowball Earth"".

The researcher were based at Curtin University in Perth.

Professor Chris Kirkland, who worked on the study, said: ""Yarrabubba, which sits between Sandstone and Meekatharra in central WA, had been recognised as an impact structure for many years, but its age wasn’t well determined.""

""Now we know the Yarrabubba crater was made right at the end of what’s commonly referred to as the early Snowball Earth – a time when the atmosphere and oceans were evolving and becoming more oxygenated and when rocks deposited on many continents recorded glacial conditions.""

The researchers can support their climate changing theory with the fact the Yarrabubba impact appears to coincide with the disappearance of glacial deposits.

Associate Professor Nicholas Timms said: ""This twist of fate suggests that the large meteorite impact may have influenced global climate.""

The study could have a significant impact for future crater investigations.

Curtin University's Dr Aaron Cavosie said: ""Our findings highlight that acquiring precise ages of known impact craters is important – this one sat in plain sight for nearly two decade before its significance was realised.

""Yarrabubba is about half the age of the Earth and it raises the question of whether all older impact craters have been eroded or if they are still out there waiting to be discovered.""

This research has been published in Nature Communications.

884,"Have you thought about how you want to be buried?

If you haven't, you might be surprised to learn that many common methods are far from environmentally friendly. Burials often involve using toxic embalming fluids that leach into the earth over time and non-degradable grave liners to keep gravesites looking flat — techniques that are good for preserving a body (sometimes indefinitely) but terrible for the environment. Even cremations release harmful emissions like carbon monoxide and mercury into the air and soil.

Growing awareness about these issues is partly why an alternative is gaining popularity across Canada: green burials.

The technique is extremely simple; the body is wrapped in a biodegradable shroud or placed in a biodegradable casket, then laid directly into the earth in a designated section of a cemetery. Usually, the spot remains unmarked, in keeping with the low-impact ethos of the movement. Eventually the plot can, and should, be used again.

""Our green burial area has a grasslands look,"" says Bradd Tuck, director of Yates Memorial Services in Parksville, B.C. ""So we just regrow grass and wildflowers.""

While cemeteries may keep permanent records of each burial site for logistical purposes, family members of the deceased won't necessarily know where the specific plot is if they return later, due to the lack of physical grave markers. But they can often enjoy the area as a park and look at communal memorials, such as big boulders with names and quotes carved into the surface.

Yates Memorial Services has been performing certified green burials for a year now, and is one of several Canadian funeral homes and cemeteries adopting the practice (though not all are certified).

The Green Burial Society of Canada, which issues the certificates, defines green burials by five simple principles: no embalming, direct earth burial, ecological restoration and conservation, communal memorialization, and optimized land use.

""It's more about the restrictions than about what we can do,"" says Tuck. ""We're not going to do an embalming, we're not going to have any plastics or metals as part of the casket or the clothing, and then we're not going to memorialize the space itself.""

The restriction on embalming can be tricky sometimes, says Tuck, especially when the family asks that the funeral be delayed, sometimes for several weeks. ""With green burials, you have to think about it differently. It's a little bit more of a hands-on approach."" In these cases, the funeral home might have to host the viewing right away, but delay the burial ceremony until the family is ready.

These might not seem like huge hurdles, so why aren't more cemeteries and funeral homes providing this option? Esthetics is one big factor.

Take a stroll through an older cemetery and you might notice that the headstones are lopsided and the ground is uneven. This happens when a casket decomposes and the pocket of air inside fills with earth, causing the ground to sink downward. Most modern cemeteries have done away with this lumpy, creepy look by requiring that graves be lined with non-degradable material — often concrete, fiberglass, or plastic — trapping the air pocket inside.

""Burial vaults"" are completely sealed and designed to remain so forever. ""Grave liners"" are only partially enclosed; though the body and casket will eventually decay, the liner persists to keep the surface of the earth level.""That sounds nice from a maintenance perspective,"" says Trevor Crean, general manager of the Heritage Gardens Cemetery in Surrey, B.C. ""But then that means that every single generation needs their own graveyard.""

And we're running out of space as a result. Crean's family has been in the funeral business for four generations, and they've had front row seats to just how this dwindling availability has affected customers. Prices for burials have increased dramatically over the years, for instance. ""Folks who are barely making ends meet, they know that their parents' parents are buried here, so they'll take out a second mortgage to make sure that their mother gets buried with her folks,"" Crean says.

Buying a burial plot in Toronto's Mount Pleasant or Vancouver's Ocean View cemeteries in the mid-'80s would have cost those grandparents about a hundred dollars, according to Crean. Buying a neighbouring plot today can cost tens of thousands of dollars. ""They don't know about people privately buying plots and flipping them like the real estate market, and that that just quadrupled the price — or more — in the last year,"" says Crean.

Skyrocketing prices is one of the reasons why cremation — which might only set you back about $2,000 — is such a popular option in Canada. About 72 per cent of Canadians chose cremation over other burial options in 2018, according to the Cremation Association of North America.

But cremation comes with its own set of environmental pitfalls. Getting a body down to ash (called ""cremains"") requires a huge amount of fuel, equivalent to about two full SUV tanks. And despite filtration systems, hazardous emissions are still expelled into the atmosphere, including carbon monoxide, mercury and cancer-inducing polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs).

Pushback against the environmental hazards of cremation and conventional burial in the U.K. began in the early '90s, where green burials are now a widespread alternative. From there, the trend spread to the United States. The first urban green burial site in Canada didn't open until 2008 at Royal Oak Burial Park in Victoria.

U.S. lawmakers are certainly taking advantage of their head start. Washington state legalized human composting earlier this year, a process in which the deceased's remains are placed in a temperature- and moisture-controlled vessel, along with other organic matter, and rotated. The decomposition process takes just weeks and results in about two wheelbarrows' worth of soil.

Human composting isn't legal yet in Canada, but Susan Koswan from Waterloo, Ont., has been trying to bring the movement to Canada as part of her Good Green Death Project. She hopes to have it legalized in the next few years, or at least before her own death.

""My dream is to create protected conservation burial forests, where the living can practise shinrin-yoku, or forest-bathing, and hear the voices of the ancestors of many in the rustling of the leaves,"" Koswan wrote in a blog post in 2018. ""Doesn't it beat the rows of silent granite in your average cemetery? And who doesn't want to be a tree after they die?""

Until then, Canadians with a similar inclination can consider Cimetières Catholique de Granby, in Granby, Que., the first Catholic cemetery in Canada to start a ""Tree of Life"" garden for the exclusive use of biodegradable urns. Made of cellulose, peat and coconut fibre, the urns can house a variety of tree or shrub seeds of your choosing. The urn breaks down over the course of one month, with the new roots feeding on the nutrients and ash.

For many Canadians, there are religious traditions to consider beyond their other personal motivations. While traditional Jewish and Muslim burial practices, which require that bodies be committed to the earth in their entirety, already eschew cremation and embalming, practicing Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs generally consider cremation to be an important part of honouring the dead, so green burials may not be an option. More environmentally friendly cremation methods — using less wood and more efficient burning techniques, for instance — are being actively explored in India, however.

Whether or not you go green for your funeral, it's important to prepare in advance — even if it's just having a short conversation with loved ones to make your values on the matter clear.

""Doing your research before [the] time of need is so crucial,"" says Crean. ""Talk about things! End of life is as natural as life. There's so much stigma around it, and so many families are missing an opportunity to do something really special. But if you do just a little bit of research in advance, you can make it a beautiful thing.""

1221,"Chinese scientist He Jiankui claims he helped make world's first genetically edited babies: twin girls whose DNA he said he altered.

HONG KONG — A Chinese researcher claims that he helped make the world’s first genetically edited babies — twin girls born this month whose DNA he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life.

If true, it would be a profound leap of science and ethics.

A U.S. scientist said he took part in the work in China, but this kind of gene editing is banned in the United States because the DNA changes can pass to future generations and it risks harming other genes.

Many mainstream scientists think it’s too unsafe to try, and some denounced the Chinese report as human experimentation.

The researcher, He Jiankui of Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, with one pregnancy resulting thus far. He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have — an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done.

There is no independent confirmation of He’s claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts. He revealed it Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organizers of an international conference on gene editing that is set to begin Tuesday, and earlier in exclusive interviews with The Associated Press.

“I feel a strong responsibility that it’s not just to make a first, but also make it an example,” He told the AP. “Society will decide what to do next” in terms of allowing or forbidding such science.

Some scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it.

It’s “unconscionable … an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,” said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal.

“This is far too premature,” said Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. “We’re dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It’s a big deal.”

However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University’s George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called “a major and growing public health threat.”

“I think this is justifiable,” Church said of that goal.

In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body. The tool, called CRISPR-Cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that’s causing problems.

It’s only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. Editing sperm, eggs, or embryos is different — the changes can be inherited. In the U.S., it’s not allowed except for lab research. China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.

He Jiankui, who goes by “JK,” studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the U.S. before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies.

The U.S. scientist who worked with him on this project after He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice in Houston. Deem also holds what he called “a small stake” in — and is on the scientific advisory boards of — He’s two companies.

The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey, and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods.

He said he chose embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell.

All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes.

Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.

He recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym “Bai Hua,” told the AP that it’s not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed.

Here is how He described the work:

The gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was “washed” to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added.

When the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said.

Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do.

Several scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm.

They also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes.

“It’s almost like not editing at all” if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said.

Church and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered.

“In that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you’re exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,” Musunuru said.

The use of that embryo suggests that the researchers’ “main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,” Church said.

Even if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it’s very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said.

There also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it — on Nov. 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials.

It’s unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an “AIDS vaccine development” program.

The Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he “absolutely” thinks they were able to understand the risks.

Deem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine.

“That might be a layman’s way of describing it,” he said.

Both men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials.

The Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical follow-up until the children are 18 and longer if they agree once they’re adults.

Further pregnancy attempts are on hold until the safety of this one is analyzed and experts in the field weigh in, but participants were not told in advance that they might not have a chance to try what they signed up for once a “first” was achieved, He acknowledged. Free fertility treatment was part of the deal they were offered.

He sought and received approval for his project from Shenzhen Harmonicare Women’s and Children’s Hospital, which is not one of the four hospitals that He said provided embryos for his research or the pregnancy attempts.

Some staff at some of the other hospitals were kept in the dark about the nature of the research, which He and Deem said was done to keep some participants’ HIV infection from being disclosed.

“We think this is ethical,” said Lin Zhitong, a Harmonicare administrator who heads the ethics panel.

Any medical staff who handled samples that might contain HIV were aware, He said. An embryologist in He’s lab, Qin Jinzhou, confirmed to the AP that he did sperm washing and injected the gene editing tool in some of the pregnancy attempts.

The study participants are not ethicists, He said, but “are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it’s their life on the line.”

“I believe this is going to help the families and their children,” He said. If it causes unwanted side effects or harm, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility.”

1024,"A bet between two friends over whether the Earth is round or flat ended with one being charged with threatening to kill the other with a crossbow.

Louie Franz and Jamie Mathew Sutherland were having dinner in the New Zealand town of Queenstown and arguing about the planet’s true shape when they made a $10,000 NZD (£5,000) wager about who was right.

Mr Franz – a believer in the widely discredited flat Earth conspiracy theory – said they shook hands on the bet about whether the world was flat before Mr Sutherland – a believer in science – immediately demanded payment.

The dispute was eventually argued out in court after Mr Sutherland was charged by police for threatening to shoot his friend and his friend’s father at a petrol station, according to the Otago Daily Times.

The flat Earth believer told the Queenstown District Court judge: “[He said] ‘If you don’t pay it I’ll get a crossbow, I’ll shoot you and your father, put you in the trunk and they’ll never see you again’.”

The strange case began two months prior to the alleged threat made in February. After arguing about the Earth, Mr Franz told his friend: “I will bet you $10,000 [NZD] it’s flat.”

“Mr Sutherland quickly jumped on that bet – we shook hands and then he said, ‘You owe me $10,000’.”

Mr Franz told judge Bernadette Farnan: “It was kind of a joke for me – it was more of a ‘I bet you $10,000 because I’m so sure I’m right’.”

When the pair met again at a petrol station on 14 February, Mr Sutherland again demanded money, and was in no mood to joke about it.

“When someone threatens to kill you with a crossbow it’s quite concerning,” said Mr Franz.

Mr Sutherland’s defence lawyer reportedly said Mr Lanz had been “adamant” in his belief the Earth was flat, but later changed his mind on the issue.

Judge Farnan – following a brief “restorative justice” meeting in which the men agreed to end their dispute – decided there was no case to answer and dismissed the charge.

922,"BARSTOW, Calif. — A California man who said he wanted to fly to the edge of outer space to see if the world is round has died after his home-built rocket blasted off into the desert sky and plunged back to earth.

“Mad” Mike Hughes was killed on Saturday afternoon after his rocket crashed on private property near Barstow, California.

Waldo Stakes, a colleague who was at the rocket launch, said Hughes, 64, was killed.

The Science Channel said on Twitter it had been chronicling Hughes’ journey and that “thoughts & prayers go out to his family & friends during this difficult time.”

“It was always his dream to do this launch,” the Twitter message said.

Hughes also was a limousine driver, who held the Guinness world record for “longest limousine ramp jump,” for jumping 103 feet in a Lincoln Town Car stretch limousine, at a speedway in 2002.

A video on TMZ.com showed the rocket taking off, with what appears to be a parachute tearing off during the launch. The steam-powered rocket streaks upward, then takes around 10 seconds to fall straight back to earth. Shrieks can be heard as the rocket plows into the desert.

Freelance journalist Justin Chapman, who was at the scene, said the rocket appeared to rub against the launch apparatus, which might have caused the mishap with the parachute.

In March 2018, Hughes propelled himself about 1,875 feet into the air. He deployed one parachute and then a second one but still had a hard landing in the Mojave Desert in California, and injured his back.

“This thing wants to kill you 10 different ways,” Hughes said after that launch. “This thing will kill you in a heartbeat.”

He said in a video that his goal was to eventually fly to the edge of outer space to determine for himself whether the world is round.

“I don’t want to take anyone else’s word for it,” he said in the video, posted on the BBC News website. “I don’t know if the world is flat or round.”

In another video posted on his YouTube site, Hughes said he also wanted “to convince people they can do things that are extraordinary with their lives.”

“My story really is incredible,” Hughes once told The Associated Press. “It’s got a bunch of story lines — the garage-built thing. I’m an older guy. It’s out in the middle of nowhere, plus the Flat Earth. The problem is it brings out all the nuts also.”",mainstream
1165,"The world of science is undoubtedly becoming more mysterious by the day. This is exemplified by multiple discoveries within the realms of quantum physics, parapsychology, and more — discoveries that have challenged (and continue to challenge) the current framework of accepted scientific knowledge. This kind of shift in ideology has happened many times over the course of our history; when the world instantaneously became round from flat, the majority of people were in disbelief and labelled the new theory’s proponents as blasphemers.

Some great examples of science that challenge these current and long held belief systems include: quantum entanglement, studies which examine the role of consciousness on physical systems (like the quantum double slit experiment), placebo studies, distant healing, and more.

Another great example is teleportation, as several interesting findings within this field seem to be (at least partly) turning science fiction into science fact.

The title asserts that he teleported DNA. It seems, as with other “fringe” topics when it comes to science, phenomena like this receives harsh criticism and resistance from a still decent sized part of science. That being said, did he really teleport DNA? Given his reputation and credibility, combined with all of the studies done in various types of teleportation, the black budget and more, I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Nobel Prize winning scientist Luc Montagnier, previously known for his work on HIV and AIDS, claims to have demonstrated that DNA can be generated from its teleported “quantum imprint.” This is a discovery that, were the scientific community to get on board, would represent “the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 years, demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry,” (source) according to theoretical chemist Jeff Reimers of the University of Sydney, Australia.

In the experiment, two adjacent but physically separate test tubes were placed within a copper coil and subjected to a very low frequency electromagnetic field of 7 hertz. The apparatus was isolated from Earth’s natural magnetic field so there was no interference. One tube contained a fragment of DNA (approximately 100 bases long) and the second one contained nothing but water. (source) (source) (source) (source)

After approximately 17 hours, the gene fragment (according to Montagnier) was recovered from both tubes, even though one should have just contained water.

Although Montagnier’s claims have received harsh criticism from various scientists, there was a general consensus that his results should be investigated further. For example, Giuseppe Vitiello, of the University of Salemo in Italy, is confident that the experiment is reliable.

Greg Scholes, from the University of Toronto, Canada, who last year demonstrated that quantum effects occur in plants, said that “the biological experiments do seem intriguing, and I wouldn’t dismiss them.” (source)

Today, numerous teleportation breakthroughs have been made. One example comes from the work of Professor Rainer Blatt at the University of Innsbruck. He and his colleagues were successfully able to perform teleportation on atoms for the first time. Their work was published in the journal Nature. (source)

Another study, published by a team of University of Queensland physicists in the journal Nature in 2013, demonstrated successful teleportation with solid state systems. (source) This is a process by which quantum information can be transmitted from one place to another without sending a physical carrier of information. This is made possible through the phenomenon of entanglement.

A team from the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI) at the University of Maryland (UMD) and the University of Michigan has succeeded in teleporting a quantum state directly from one atom to another over a substantial distance. (source)

There are different categories of teleportation. Another types of teleportation apart from quantum is psychic, which is the conveyance of persons or inanimate objects by psychic means.

“It became known to myself, along with several colleagues both inside and outside of government, that anomalous teleportation has been scientifically investigated and separately documented by the Department of Defense.” (source) – Eric Davis, Ph.D, FBIS

A paper published in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in September 1981, in the journal Ziran Zazhi (Nature Journal), reported that “gifted children” were able to cause the teleportation of small, physical objects from one place to another. Objects included watches, horseflies, other insects, radio micro-transmitters, photosensitive paper and more. The paper, titled “Some Experiments on the Transfer of Objects Performed by Unusual Abilities of the Human Body” (Shuhuang et al., 1981), reveals that participants never touched the objects beforehand. The experiments were done under both blind and double-blind conditions, and the researchers involved came from various colleges and sectors of the Department of Defense.

Furthermore, scientists have conducted studies on people in the lab which produced remarkable results, observing people describe physical objects that had been hidden in a remote location. (source)

The list of strange things reported in the world of science is never ending, and I believe the ‘politicization’ of academia and publications, as well as the ‘black budget‘ world, are important things to think about when it comes to the world of science, what research gets published, and what our minds are willing to explore – regardless of how hard it might be to accept.",conspiracy

He may have had his hands full with more down-to-earth problems last week, but even President Carter took time out to watch an otherworldly show as the Voyager 1 spacecraft made its closest approach to the giant planet Jupiter. Coming within 278,000 km (172,400 miles) of the swirling Jovian cloud tops, the robot survived intense radiation, peered deep into the planet's storm-tossed cloud cover, provided startling views of the larger Jovian moons and, most surprising of all, revealed the presence of a thin, flat ring around the great planet. Said University of Arizona Astronomer Bradford Smith: ""We're standing here with our mouths open, reluctant to tear ourselves away.""

There was every reason for exhilaration. As Voyager curved around the sun's largest planet at speeds up to 104,600 km (65,000 miles) per hour, the craft performed nearly flawlessly, its probing eyes and instruments shifting between Jupiter and its moons. As one startling picture after another flashed onto the screens at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, even Cornell's irrepressible Carl Sagan was left nearly speechless. Said he: ""This is almost beyond interpretation. There's different chemistry, different physics, different forces at work out there.""

The close encounter lasted 39 tense hours, during which Voyager sent back enough data to fill up miles of magnetic tape and keep scientists busy for years ahead. But Voyager has already opened up new worlds for them. Ablaze with colors of every shade and hue, speckled with strange, often puzzling features, the Jovian moons prompted oohs and aahs from even the most seasoned scientists.

As the center of a kind of mini-solar system, Jupiter is surrounded by at least 13 moons, and possibly a 14th. The four largestlo, Europa, Ganymede and Callistoare the so-called Galilean moons (named after their discoverer). Like the earth's moon, they are large enough to be considered small planets, but appeared as little more than fuzzy blobs in earth-bound telescopes. Now, Voyager's cameras have found that these moons are not only complex but also markedly different, their surfaces varying greatly in age, composition and appearance. Observed the U.S. Geological Survey's Laurence Soderblom: ""There is no such thing as a boring Galilean moon.""

The surface of Callisto, the outermost of these moons, is riddled with craters, apparently the result of pummeling by meteorites for some 4 billion years. Although it is mountainless, Callisto has a feature never before seen in the solar system: a huge, smooth, circular basin rimmed with concentric ridges that look almost like a frozen tsunami (tidal wave). Appearances may not be entirely deceiving: the scientists speculated that these ridges were created when a particularly large meteorite hit, melted subsurface ice and caused the water to spread out from the place of impact, only to freeze rapidly again.

Neighboring Ganymede, like Callisto, is at least half composed of water and ice. It shows sinuous ridges and crisscrossing fractures that look like earthly fault linespossibly caused by what Soderblom calls ""water quakes."" Ganymede's surface is less cratered than Callisto's and only a fourth its age, about 1 billion years.",mainstream
1156,"The countdown to launch creeps closer and there’s still plenty for self-taught rocket scientist “Mad” Mike Hughes to do: Last-second modifications to his vessel. Pick up his flight suit. Leave enough food for his four cats — just in case anything happens.

Hughes is a 61-year-old limo driver who’s spent the last few years building a steam-powered rocket out of salvage parts in his garage. His project has cost him $20,000, which includes Rust-Oleum paint to fancy it up and a motor home he bought on Craigslist that he converted into a ramp.

His first test of the rocket will also be the launch date — Saturday , when he straps into his homemade contraption and attempts to hurtle over the ghost town of Amboy, California. He will travel about a mile at a speed of roughly 500 mph.

“If you’re not scared to death, you’re an idiot,” Hughes said . “It’s scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive. I like to do extraordinary things that no one else can do, and no one in the history of mankind has designed, built and launched himself in his own rocket.

The daredevil/limo driver has been called a little bit of everything over his career — eccentric, quirky, foolhardy. Doesn’t bother him. He believes what he believes, including that the Earth is flat. He knows this thought is a conundrum, given that he’s about to launch himself into the atmosphere.

Down the road, he’s intending to build a rocket that takes him to space, so he can snap a picture and see with his own eyes.

“I don’t believe in science,” said Hughes, whose main sponsor for the rocket is Research Flat Earth. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air, about the certain size of rocket nozzles, and thrust. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula. There’s no difference between science and science fiction.”

This will actually be the second time he’s constructed and launched a rocket. He jumped on a private property in Winkelman, Arizona, on Jan. 30, 2014 , and traveled 1,374 feet. He collapsed after that landing — the G-forces taking a toll — and needed three days to recover.

That distance, though, would’ve been enough to clear the Snake River Canyon, which is a jump daredevil Evel Knievel made famous when he failed to clear it during his attempt in 1974. Stuntman Eddie Braun did successfully zoom over the canyon — using Knievel’s original blueprints — in September 2016.

Just don’t mention Knievel around Hughes. He’s not a fan.

“He was an average stunt guy,” said Hughes, a former motorcycle racer. “He stole his look from Elvis.”

Hughes constructed his latest rocket at the “Rocket Ranch” in Apple Valley, California. It’s a five-acre property he leases from Waldo Stakes , the CEO of Land Speed Research Vehicles who’s currently working on a project to make a car travel 2,000 mph.

Their relationship formed a few years ago when Hughes approached Stakes about building a rocket. Stakes receives plenty of these sorts of requests, but this one stood out because Hughes was building it himself.

“Nothing is out of reach,” Stakes said. “Anything can be done. You just have to put enough money, time and thought into it.”

Here’s the thing: Hughes doesn’t make all that much money — $15 per hour as a limo driver, plus tips. That’s why he’s scrounged for parts, finding the aluminum for his rocket in metal shops and constructing the rocket nozzle out of an aircraft air filter. He gave it a good varnish of cheap paint, and his launch pad is attached to a motor home he bought for $1,500.

“I want to inspire others — and you have to do something incredible to get anybody’s attention,” Hughes said.

The location of the jump will be Amboy , a ghost town in the Mojave Desert and along historic Route 66. The fictional town of Radiator Springs in the Disney movie “Cars” was loosely based on Amboy.

Hughes got permission from the town’s owner, Albert Okura, who purchased the rights to Amboy in 2005 for $435,000. The launch will take place on an air strip next to a dilapidated hangar.

“It is absolutely the most wacky promotional proposal I have had since I purchased the entire town in 2005,” said Okura, who’s also the founder of the Juan Pollo restaurant chain. “He is a true daredevil and I want to be part of it.”

On the morning of the launch, Hughes will heat about 70 gallons of water in a stainless steel tank and then blast off between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. He plans to go about a mile — reaching an altitude of about 1,800 feet — before pulling two parachutes. They’re discouraging fans — safety issues — but it will be televised on his YouTube channel . He said he’s been in contact with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management.

Following his jump, he said he’s going to announce his plans to leap into the race for governor of California.

His future plans include an excursion into space. He and Stakes have already brainstormed on a “Rockoon,” which is a rocket that, rather than being immediately ignited while on the ground, is carried into the atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon, then separated from the balloon and lit. This rocket will take Hughes about 68 miles up.

First things first — this jump over a ghost town. He will be tinkering with his rocket right up to takeoff.

“A guy who builds his own rocket in his garage, about to jump a mile is pretty cool,” Hughes said. “It’s the most interesting human-interest story in the world.”",mainstream
104,"These findings allowed the team to paint a new picture — one that doesn’t discount the glaciation at the time, but suggests that the cooler climate was punctuated by global warming events triggered by volcanic eruptions.

“It all just seemed to fit together quite nicely,” Dr. Bond said.

In the story they tell, Earth’s crust began to break open just before both pulses of extinction. Giant cracks released walls of lava that erupted hundreds of feet into the air and extended for hundreds of miles. So many flows could have deposited lava up to a million square miles away, plus mercury and enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to drive global warming. That, in turn, caused a cascade of effects, from punching holes in the ozone layer to reducing oxygen in the ocean.

“This wasn’t an oddball cooling event,” Dr. Grasby said. “It joins the club as another ‘death by warming.’”

Seth Finnegan, a paleobiologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the research, has questions about the study’s mercury data. It’s possible, he says, that mercury (from later volcanic eruptions or elsewhere) moved into Ordovician rock shortly after the extinction pulses.

Dr. Dewing said that if one rock showed an anomalously high mercury signature, it might be cause for concern. But the team saw it in rock after rock after rock.

“It’s a very pronounced change right at that point,” Dr. Dewing said. “So it’s not just one bad data point.”

The new hypothesis points toward a number of tests that scientists can now undertake, like studying Ordovician rocks in other locations for the same signatures. That alone is a huge step beyond the global cooling hypothesis, which Dr. Dewing said “was almost more like a belief system.” In addition, scientists can attempt to pinpoint the volcanic region that dates back to that time (as they have done with other periods of mass extinction).",mainstream
917,"A government-run study of Gilead’s remdesivir, perhaps the most closely watched experimental drug to treat the novel coronavirus, showed that the medicine is effective against Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.

In a statement on Wednesday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is conducting the study, said preliminary data show patients who received remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received placebo.

The finding — although difficult to fully characterize without full, detailed data for the study — would represent the first treatment shown to improve outcomes in patients infected with the virus that put the global economy in a standstill and killed at least 218,000 people worldwide.

During an appearance alongside President Trump in the Oval Office, Anthony Fauci, the director of NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health, said the data are a “very important proof of concept” and that there was reason for optimism. He cautioned the data were not a “knockout.” At the same time, the study achieved its primary goal, which was to improve the time to recovery, which was reduced by four days for patients on remdesivir.

The preliminary data showed that the time to recovery was 11 days on remdesivir compared to 15 days for placebo, a 31% decrease. The mortality rate for the remdesivir group was 8%, compared to 11.6% for the placebo group; that mortality difference was not statistically significant.

That is “the first convincing evidence that an antiviral drug can really benefit Covid-19 patients, specifically hospitalized Covid-19 patients,” said Frederick Hayden, a professor emeritus of clinical virology and medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. “This will change the standard of care in the United States and other countries for the patients who have been shown to be benefited,” he said, adding that determining the exact group that should receive the drug will require further examination of the data.

Over the past few weeks, there have been conflicting reports about the potential benefit of remdesivir, a drug that was previously tried in Ebola. As previously reported by STAT, an early peek at Gilead’s study in severe Covid-19 patients, based on data from a trial at a Chicago hospital, suggested patients were doing better than expected on remdesivir. Days later, a summary of results from a study in China showed that patients on the drug did not improve more than those in a control group.

Full results from the China study were also released Wednesday.

But the NIAID study, which was not expected to be released so soon, was by far the most important and rigorously designed test of remdesivir in Covid-19. The study compared remdesivir to placebo in 800 patients, with neither patients nor physicians knowing who got the drug instead of a placebo, meaning that unconscious biases will not affect the conclusions.



The main goal of the study is the time until patients improve, with different measures of improvement depending on how sick they were to begin with. While the result means that the drug helps patients improve faster, it is not possible to say how dramatic those improvements are.

Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said he expected there was enough evidence for the agency to issue an “emergency use authorization” for remdesivir.

“Remdesivir isn’t a home run but looks active and can be part of a toolbox of drugs and diagnostics that substantially lower our risk heading into the fall,” he said.



Aneesh Mehta, a physician at Emory University and an investigator in the NIAID study, said the results were “robust enough” to report preliminary findings, but a full analysis of all the data will be required to fully understand the drug’s effect. The time to recovery seen in the final analysis “could be shorter, it could be longer. We don’t know yet.” Mehta also expects the final results to do some analyses on which patients might benefit most from remdesivir.

The FDA previously issued an emergency authorization for the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, even though at least some studies suggested the medicine was not effective. “If hydroxychloroquine met [the emergency] standard, then remdesivir would have seemed to cross that line a while ago, especially in the setting of treating critically ill patients,” Gottlieb said.

Remdesivir, which must be given intravenously, is likely to remain a treatment for patients who are hospitalized. But it is also likely that it will be most effective in patients who have been infected more recently, said Nahid Bhadelia, medical director of the special pathogens unit at Boston Medical Center.

“We know that with most antiviral medications the earlier you give it the better it is.” said Bhadelia, who had experience giving remdesivir as an experimental treatment for Ebola in Africa, where results are less encouraging. That means that better diagnostic testing will be essential to identifying patients who could benefit. “What will be important is that we find people on the outpatient side,” Bhadelia said. “Again, testing becomes important, we want to have them come to the hospital as soon as possible.”



Although the data have not yet been released, it’s standard procedure for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to release market-moving information as soon as they have it, due to regulatory requirements.

Gilead on Wednesday did release data from its own study of remdesivir in patients with severe Covid-19. This study showed similar rates of clinical improvement in patients treated with a five-day and 10-day course of remdesivir, the company said.

“Unlike traditional drug development, we are attempting to evaluate an investigational agent alongside an evolving global pandemic. Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 and how to best utilize the drug,” said Merdad Parsey, Gilead’s chief medical officer, in a statement.

Gilead said that its own study in severe patients showed that it may be possible to treat patients with a five-day treatment of remdesivir, not the 10-day course that was used in the NIAID trial.

The company’s study is enrolling approximately 6,000 participants from 152 different clinical trial sites all over the world. The data disclosed Wednesday are from 397 patients, with a statistical comparison of patient improvement between the two remdesivir treatment arms — the five-day and 10-day treatment courses. Improvement was measured using a seven-point numerical scale that encompasses death (at worst) and discharge from hospital (best outcome), with various degrees of supplemental oxygen and intubation in between.

The study design means that by itself it doesn’t reveal much about how well remdesivir is working, because there is no group of patients who were untreated. The conclusion is that the two durations of treatment are basically the same.

Peter Bach, the director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Medical Center, said he is eager to see the data from the NIAID study but renewed his criticism of Gilead’s severe study for lacking a control group of untreated patients. That would have allowed researchers to make important conclusions about how the drug works that are just not possible now, he said.

“They’ve squandered an unbelievable opportunity,” Bach said. “It’s not going to tell us what to do with 80-year-olds with multiple comorbidities compared to 30-year-olds who are otherwise healthy. We’re still going to be foundering around in the dark, or at least in a dim room, when we could have learned more.”

In the study, the median time to clinical improvement was 10 days in the five-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of the patients in both groups were discharged from the hospital by day 14. At day 14, 64.5% of the patients in the five-day group and 53.8% of the patients in the 10-day group achieved clinical recovery.

Patients in the trial generally lived, though this may be because their illness was not that severe to begin with. For most of the study, patients already on ventilators were not enrolled.

Eight percent of the patients treated with five days of remdesivir died, compared to 11% of the patients treated for 10 days. Outside of Italy, where 77 patients were treated, the overall mortality rate across the entire study was 7%, Gilead said. Those mortality rates are lower than those seen in other studies, which have been in the teens and twenties.

Only 5% of patients in the five-day group and 10% in the 10-day group had side effects that led to a discontinuation. The most common bad effects — and it’s impossible to tell which were from the drug — were nausea and acute respiratory failure. High liver enzymes occurred in 7.3% of patients, with 3% of patients discontinuing the drug due to elevated liver tests.

A full evaluation of the results will have to wait until complete data are available.

In the China study, also published Wednesday in the Lancet, investigators found that remdesivir “did not significantly improve the time to clinical improvement, mortality, or time to clearance of virus in patients with serious COVID-19 compared with placebo.”

There was a 23% improvement in time to clinical improvement for remdesivir compared to placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant. At the median, remdesivir-treated patients improved in 20 days compared to 23 days for placebo patients. At one month, 14% of the remdesivir patients had died compared to 13% of the placebo-treated patients.

The China study enrolled patients with more severe Covid-19 than the study conducted by NIAID. The China study was also stopped early because of difficulties enrolling patients as the pandemic waned in China.

Hayden, the University of Virginia virologist, was one of the investigators in the China study and pointed to the similarity of the results. He said that while the NIAID investigators had been able to enroll enough patients, the decrease in cases in Wuhan due to the lockdown had made that impossible. “I was struck by the consistency,” he said.",mainstream
1295,"Star engineer Elon Musk unveiled an ambitious plan late Tuesday for a human colony on Mars as early as 2024. According to Musk, his company SpaceX is working on a new rocket and capsule capable of bringing 100 people to the red planet at a time.

Once the infrastructure is in place, SpaceX envisions flying to Mars once very 25 months, when it is best aligned with the Earth. One major difference between Musk's plan and similar endeavors like Netherlands-based Mars One is that because a key business strategy of SpaceX is to reuse spacecraft, colonists would not be signed up for a one-way ticket.

""The number of people willing to move to Mars is much greater if they have the option of returning, even if they never do,"" Musk said at the International Astronautical Congress meeting in Guadalajara., Mexico.

He added the caveat, however, that the risk of accidents and fatality remains a major risk of space travel.

""The risk of fatality will be high. There's no way around it. Basically, are you prepared to die, and if that's OK then you're a candidate for going,"" he said during his presentation.

Another important factor is cementing his plan is to keep costs down, the inventor told the audience. He estimated it would take $10 billion to finance the large colony SpaceX hopes for.

""You can't create a self-sustaining civilization if the ticket price is $10 billion per person,"" the investor told the audience. ""Our goal is to get it roughly equivalent to (the) cost of a median house in the United States, about $200,000.""

He addd that the trip to Mars would be ""fun"" - and that the capsule bring people to Mars would have restaurants, games, and movies.

Musk's grandiose plan also includes eventually developing technology for terraforming – the process of turning an alien planet's ground and atmosphere into earth-like conditions.

Mars lies some 225 million kilometers (140 million miles) from Earth. The journey there would take between six and nine months, though Musk said his newly designed craft would cut travel time down to three months. NASA has agreed to help with communications and consulting in exchange for SpaceX's flight data.

The company's plan remains an extremely lofty one, for even after safety, financial, and transport kinks are worked out, thus far the largest spacecraft that has been able to land on Mars was the one-ton Curiosity rover. That and SpaceX's two recent accidents that resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment when rockets exploded may prove bigger hurdles than Musk anticipates.",mainstream
693,"A self-taught rocket scientist has blasted himself high into the California sky using a steam-powered contraption he built in his garage, the first step in his long-term aim of proving the Earth is flat.

“Mad” Mike Hughes propelled himself 1,875 feet (571m) into the air above the vast Mojave desert in the homemade rocket before deploying his parachute and landing back to Earth with a bump.

The madcap 61-year-old limo-driver-turned-daredevil was visibly dazed as he was carefully lifted from his seat and was checked over by paramedics as he lay exhausted on the ground following a hard landing which damaged the front of his rocket.

“Am I glad I did it? Yeah. I guess,” he told the Associated Press. “I'll feel it in the morning. I won't be able to get out of bed. At least I can go home and have dinner and see my cats tonight.”

The Flat-Earther, who has spent around $20,000 (£14,000) pursuing his rocket dream since 2016, admitted he was “relieved” to have finally achieved his goal following several aborted attempts and ridicule from some quarters when his plan captured the attention of the world’s media last year.",mainstream
1114,"Rapper B.o.B. has caused a furore by tweeting that the Earth is in fact flat, and you only need to look at the evidence to come to the same conclusion. Obviously, prominent scientists have openly mocked this claim, showing the many ways in which it is ludicrous, no matter how many people insist otherwise. They’re right though; sadly. B.o.B. is wrong. His nonsense claims, such as the idea that Earth’s curvature should be visible at certain distances but isn’t, are just that: nonsense. His comments and insistent statements are little more than childish naivety. In truth, the conspiracy goes much, much deeper than that.

For example, the Earth really is flat. As in totally flat, like a sheet of glass. The definition of flat is “having a level surface; without raised areas or indentations”. So how can you have tall buildings and mountains if the Earth is flat? You can’t. Q.E.D. It would be like saying a hedgehog is flat, which, barring an unfortunate encounter with a heavy goods vehicle, it clearly isn’t.

Some might take issue with this, based on the flimsy evidence that they can see buildings, hills, trees, mountains and things like that everywhere, and may even be in or on them right now. This is just another example of how blinkered people are. If you look closely, the clues are everywhere.

For instance, what’s the tallest supposed mountain on Earth? Everest. Except it isn’t. The name is a giveaway; it’s clearly a morphing of “never rest”, because if you wanted to go to the biggest mountain you’d literally never rest, because it isn’t actually there. What about all those people who have climbed it, you say? Well, consider all the people who have died supposedly doing so. How do you die climbing something that isn’t there? You can’t. They were obviously killed to protect the conspiracy, whereas those who “survived” were willing to play ball.

And if that isn’t clear enough, pretty much everyone who attempts to climb Everest takes oxygen with them. Why would you do that when there’s oxygen all around us, in the air? Wherever they’re going, it isn’t on Earth. You know where you do need oxygen, though? THE MOON! That’s where they’re going. So-called mountaineers are being sent to the moon in order to fake climbing Everest. This is why Nasa had to fake the moon landing with astronauts, because it was already full of mountaineers and they couldn’t risk exposing that conspiracy. See how it all adds up?

Some might still object, because they’re currently sitting in a tall building. They’re not though, they only “think” they are. In truth, everyone is breathing in a potent mix of hallucinogens that are constantly in the air around us, and these cause us to perceive buildings and tall things where there are none. How did these hallucinogens get in the air? Well, that’s what chemtrails are actually for.

Don’t worry, these hallucinogenic compounds aren’t provided by evil “Big Pharma”; they’re actually secreted by the shape-shifting lizards that rule society. Why do you think lizards are in charge in the first place? They provide the secretions that keep the population in line, believing in things like the Earth is round and buildings exist. The few times people have actually tried to make a tall building like the World Trade Centre, it is destroyed by the government.

Some refer to “false flags” at times like this. In truth, all flags are false; they’re non-existent tall structures, so are just figments of our collective imagination.

This leads us on to other considerations though, like how thick is the Earth? It may be totally flat, but nobody said it’s two-dimensional. It must have a thickness, because we can go underground or underwater. Unlike mountains, the oceans are clearly real, because otherwise where did Atlantis go?

The deepest part of the ocean we know about is the Mariana trench, a full 7 miles down. This means the Earth is at least 7 miles thick, and probably a lot more so, because that’s a lot of water on top of it and it would need to be solid enough to keep it all in, lest all of the seas leak out of the bottom of the world. This clearly isn’t happening, even if you do ignore the nonsense that is rising sea levels due to global warming. How can you have global warming without a globe to warm? Hoisted by your own petard there, scientists!

Maybe the world is as thick as it is wide, and is actually a cube? Scientists scoff at this notion, arguing that gravity would mean the atmosphere would be much thicker at the centre of the each surface and nearly barren at the poles. But have you noticed how the atmosphere is much more humid at the so-called “equator” yet the poles are practically lifeless? Coincidence? OBVIOUSLY NOT!

When you follow this train of logic, it becomes clear that the only feasible conclusion is that Earth is indeed flat. Flatter than anyone has ever expected.

Either that, or the human brain has a habit of looking for patterns in innocuous or coincidental occurrences, ascribing great significance to any connection it can find and trying to make sense of them despite the absence of any concrete evidence. But seriously, that’s a bit of a far-fetched claim isn’t it?

978,"In today's world, where even basic facts are being distorted and disputed depending on one's partisan lens, misinformation runs rampant on social media. And there's no topic for which that is truer than the most partisan issue of all in the U.S. today: climate change.

This week, a false claim about volcanoes posted on Twitter went viral. The tweet claimed that Tuesday's eruption of Mt. Merapi in Indonesia ""spewed more CO2 than every car driven in history. Climate change is natural.""

The tweet generated tremendous interest and engagement, with over 100,000 likes and millions of video views. But scientists say the claim is blatantly false.

""There are a billion cars on the planet today, and this volcano's emissions are tiny compared to their pollution. The statement is pants-on-fire false,"" says Rob Jackson, a professor of Earth System Science at Stanford University and chair of the Global Carbon Project, a collaboration that measures the various contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions.
• None From ""flat Earth"" to climate change denial, kids are deluged with fake science
• None 10 common myths about climate change — and what science really says

""The eruption referred to looks fairly small compared to others at that volcano and around the world,"" agrees Dr. Ellen Prager, an earth and ocean scientist and author of ""Dangerous Earth,"" a book about volcanoes and climate change. ""The ash and gas cloud reportedly rose to 6,000 meters high. In the Mt. Pinatubo eruption of 1991 the ash and gas cloud rose 35,000 meters and was hundreds of kilometers wide.""

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, in an average year all global volcanic activity releases a total of 0.13 to 0.44 gigatons of CO2 emissions. In the U.S. alone, in 2017, emissions from transportation from all on-road vehicles was 1.56 gigatons of CO2 equivalent. So, just in the U.S. in a single year, emissions from vehicles is five times greater than all global volcanoes.

 

The total greenhouse gas emissions from on-road vehicles worldwide is greater than 3.0 gigatons per year — more than 10 times the yearly volcano output. And when compared to the 42 gigatons of emissions produced by all human contributions per year (from energy production, agriculture, industry, etc.), the contribution from volcanoes appears relatively tiny — approximately 150 times less.

Remember, the tweet's claim was not referring to just one year, but ""more CO2 than every car driven in history."" So the claim is not just wrong, it's wrong my multiple orders of magnitude.

Erroneous claims regarding volcanoes and carbon dioxide emissions are nothing new — they have been making the rounds for decades. In 2015, the fact-checking website Snopes addressed this exact topic and rated the claim as false.

As a scientist, posts that misrepresent the facts concern Prager. ""Claims like this, not based on data, breeds misunderstanding,"" she said, noting that it ""fosters and is a function of science illiteracy.""

CNET senior producer Dan Patterson, who covers technology and disinformation, sees a problem that stretches beyond science. ""Posts like this often disregard facts and science, which might conflict with how we see the world, and instead pander to our emotions and what we want to believe,"" he said. They're especially problematic on sites like Twitter and Facebook, where ""inauthentic and misleading social media posts can spread like wildfire.""

The false claim was tweeted by a man who says he is running for governor of California in 2022. He follows his claim about climate change with the assertion, ""Taxing us into poverty isn't the answer.""

This sentence, referring to the fear of the cost of potential solutions, is a wide-open window into why this issue has become so politicized. While on its face the debate seems to be about science, under the surface it's mainly an argument about one's political worldview.

The tweet's author, Matt Thomas, revealed as much in a follow-up post when he wrote: ""This original post was more about taxing us then it was climate.""

CBS News asked Ed Maibach, director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, why this tweet is getting so much attention.

Millennials in America sometimes get a bad reputation, this time for good reason. A recent survey found that just 66 percent of young adults aged 18 to 24 years old have ""always believed the world is round.""

YouGov polled 8,215 US adults on February 8th, 2018 to get a representative idea of America's views on the shape of the Earth. What they found would make any scientist shake their heads, a surprising percentage of responders weren't convinced the Earth is round.

The question asked individuals to categorize their thoughts surrounding the shape of the Earth into one of the five buckets below:

The survey found that 2% of Americans firmly believe the Earth is flat, with interesting differences segmented by age, religion, income, and political affiliation.

Of the thousands of American adults surveyed, the percent that always believed the Earth is round decreased with younger generations. In total, 84% of Americans responded that they believe the Earth is round. While the large majority believe the world is round, young millennials aged 18 to 24 are more likely to subscribe to the flat Earth belief (4%).

Religious beliefs appear to be correlated with one's likelihood to subscribe to a flat Earth. YouGov found that 52 percent of flat earthers consider themselves ""very religious.""

The degree to which Americans, particularly those who are very religious and/or a millennial is troubling on many levels. Are millennials sourcing their beliefs from sports stars such as Kyrie Irving, who regularly claims the Earth is flat? Or is there an underlying disbelief of science that is fueling their rejection of a spherical world? It's hard to know for sure the underlying causes prompting a belief in a flat Earth for different segments of Americans.

Robin Andrews with IFLScience pointed out that staunch religious conservatives tend to hold a disbelief in science and are unwilling to support scientific research and findings.

Comparing religious beliefs, YouGov found that Democrats are slightly less likely to believe the Earth is round than Republicans (83 versus 89 percent, respectively). This, perhaps, could be an overprint of younger generations more likely to lean Democratic and older generations more likely to lean Republican. While YouGov didn't find a significant variation in flat Earth beliefs geographically, they did find a significant variation based on income level.

The survey found that those with an income less than $40,000 (79%) are much less likely to believe the world is round compared to those with an income over $80,000 (92%).",mainstream

1106,"Negotiations are under way between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) in a bid to end a conflict that has taken more than 35,000 lives over the past decade alone. This is good news, but the identity of the latest figure to take a hand in the negotiations is a little strange: Richard Grasso, president of the New York Stock Exchange.

Last week Grasso flew into a demilitarised region of Colombia's southern jungle and savannah for talks with Farc's leader, Manuel Marulanda, a legendary figure known as ""Sureshot"". It must have been an unlikely confrontation - the arch-capitalist and the leader of a Marxist outfit which hates Yanqui imperialism above all else. Apparently Grasso, whose presence in Colombia was kept secret, had asked for a meeting to discuss foreign investment and the future role in Colombia of US businesses, which have traditionally been the target of Latin America's largest and oldest rebel army. Farc has been fighting the state since the mid-1960s.

Maybe Grasso managed to persuade the revolutionaries to abandon their usual fundraising methods - kidnapping and demanding large ransoms - and to invest instead in a mutual fund tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Getting spattered by the odd egg has been a routine hazard for Western politicians since the days they travelled from stump to stump by horse- drawn coach. Not so in Russia, especially if the target happens to be the celebrated film director, monarchist and (if you believe the Moscow rumour mill) possible presidential candidate, Nikita Mikhalkov.

Last week a man was given a two-and-a-half-year suspended sentence for hooliganism after hurling an egg at the great man, whose Burnt By the Sun won an Oscar in 1995. Dmitri Bakhur had already spent four months awaiting trial in the notorious Butyrka prison. His crime occurred at the Central House of Cinematographers, where the director was giving a lecture. As he heaped praise on his own latest movie, The Barber of Siberia, Mr Bakhur and his co-conspirator - both members of the anti-monarchist National Bolshevik Party - let loose with a couple of eggs, one of which spattered the director's Italian trousers.

According to eye-witnesses, Mr Mikhalkov went up to Mr Bakhur, who had been pinned down by security guards, and kicked him in the face. ""Then he said: `Go get them!' and people who appeared so cultural jumped on them like a bunch of wild beasts and started beating them.""

1335,"""Cosmos"" host and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson recently shot down the ideas of anyone who still thinks the Earth is flat. In a new YouTube video on the scientist's StarTalk channel, he used examples ranging from space observations to ancient Greek experiments in a conversation with stand-up comedian Chuck Nice.

""So, tell me, Neil, is the Earth flat?"" Nice said to open the conversation.

""We have video from space of the rotating, spherical Earth. The Earth is round,"" was Tyson's laconic response. [Even a Kid Can Prove the Earth Is Round: Here's How]

Satisfied, Nice joked, ""Thank you for joining us on this episode,"" and pretended to wrap things up. But the co-hosts continued their conversation in a 9-minute video that is based on a chapter in Tyson's new book, ""Astrophysics for People in a Hurry"" (W.W. Norton, 2017).

""What's odd,"" Tyson continued, ""is there are people who think that Earth is flat but recognize that the moon is round. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and the sun are all spheres. But Earth is flat ... something doesn't square here.""

Tyson explained that because of the laws of physics and the way energy works, the universe ""favors the sphere"" when forming planets and other bodies. Sometimes, a sphere might be distorted because it's rotating very fast. But almost everything in the universe, he added, is spherical or almost spherical.

Tyson did not address asteroids, which are small bodies of ice and rock and are irregularly shaped. It is widely recognized, however, that these asteroids have a gravity too low to pull their mass into a sphere. Worlds orbiting the sun that do have spherical bodies are sometimes called planets, but only if they meet certain criteria set by the International Astronomical Union.

In the example of Pluto — once considered a planet — the IAU ruled in 2006 that the body is not big enough to clear debris from its path and therefore should be reclassified as a dwarf planet. That's a controversial definition, one that Pluto's New Horizons spacecraft team does not agree with. But for his part, Tyson (as shown in many other sources, such as this 2017 clip from ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert "") really, really doesn't believe Pluto fits the definition of planethood.

Tyson was similarly outspoken in the new StarTalk video. He said there are people in the U.S. who believe in a flat Earth for two reasons: the country protects free speech, and its educational system doesn't teach students to think critically about the evidence.

There's even more evidence that the Earth is round, Tyson said. During lunar eclipses, the moon passes into the Earth's shadow and lies directly opposite to the sun. The shape of the Earth's shadow is always round in these eclipses. If Earth were a flat planet, at times, you would see a flat shadow on the moon. But that's never happened, Tyson added. The Earth must be a sphere, because that's the only thing that casts a perfect circle every time.

Or think about a ship sailing toward the horizon, Tyson said — it gradually disappears, because the Earth is curved. Or, he said, if he were to send co-host Nice on a journey around the Earth, Tyson could turn his chair 180 degrees and eventually see Nice arriving back where the comedian had started. (Nice quipped that would take him 150 years to accomplish the trip, because ""I'm no Forrest Gump. It would take me that long to run the Earth."")

Tyson further described an ancient experiment by the Greek Eratosthenes, who lived in Alexandria around 250 B.C. Eratosthenes noted that in an Egyptian city called Syene (near modern-day Aswan), you could see right to the bottom of a well at noon during the summer solstice. On the same day, you couldn't see to the bottom of a well in Alexandria.

There are two possible explanations for that observation, Tyson added. The first is that the Earth is flat and has a small sun, close to the planet. The second is that the Earth is curved, with a sun further from the planet. But if you were to extend the argument to three wells, there's no way a flat Earth's geometry would fit the experiment's results, he added.

So, what if people still believe the Earth is flat?

""That's OK,"" Tyson quipped, ""as long as you don't run NASA.""

675,"It is stunning that I have to write this article, but I do. A popular rapper has launched a GoFundMe to prove that the Earth is flat. Several professional basketball players have also weighed in with their perspective. The picture of Earth below is pretty definitive, but there are basic meteorological ""pieces of evidence"" too. Herein, I explore three of the most important ones.

Sunsets: Have you ever watched a sunset? If so, it is a compelling""duh"" that the Earth is not flat. If you observe the horizon at sunset, typically the sun disappears from your view in a bottom-up direction. In a very simple experiment described on the PBS website,

This fact is how ancient sailors knew that Earth was spherical (and the fact that they did not sail off of some mythical edge). As the sun falls increasingly below the horizon, more of the shorter wavelength light is scattered out as it travels through more of the atmosphere. This scattering leaves the longer wavelength colors of reddish-orange.

General circulation of the atmosphere: It is intuitive to most people that it is warm in the tropical regions of the planet and cool in the polar regions. Because of the Earth's curvature, the mid-section of Earth receives more of the direct radiation from the sun. This means that there is more heat concentrated in the tropical atmosphere and ocean. The NASA satellite maps below illustrate that this radiation imbalance is prevalent irrespective of season.

The Earth is continually trying to remove the excess heat in the tropics. One way that Earth tries to put itself on a ""heat"" diet to remove excess heat in the mid-section is through poleward-moving ocean currents. A good example in the United States is the Gulf Stream. It is a warm, poleward flowing current. Hurricanes are another mechanism that transports excess heat from the tropics to the poles. The general circulation of the atmosphere also evolves because of the net imbalance of heating. In its simplest form, the air rises over the warmer tropics and sinks over the cooler polar regions. This is a thermally-direct circulation.

In reality, it is a bit more complex as described on NOAA website,

Since the earth rotates, the axis is tilted, and there is more land mass in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere, the actual global pattern is much more complicated. Instead of one large circulation between the poles and the equator, there are three circulations. (1) Hadley cell - Low latitude air movement toward the equator that with heating, rises vertically, with poleward movement in the upper atmosphere. This forms a convection cell that dominates tropical and sub-tropical climates. (2) Ferrel cell - A mid-latitude mean atmospheric circulation cell for weather named by Ferrel in the 19th century. In this cell the air flows poleward and eastward near the surface and equatorward and westward at higher levels. (3) Polar cell - Air rises, diverges, and travels toward the poles. Once over the poles, the air sinks, forming the polar highs. At the surface air diverges outward from the polar highs. Surface winds in the polar cell are easterly (polar easterlies).

This general circulation model is directly tied to global patterns of high-low pressure, jet streams, and weather systems.

Weather radar: I cut my teeth as a radar meteorologist. Some of my earliest graduate work at Florida State University developed weather radar algorithms to track hurricanes. I also teach a radar and mesoscale meteorology course at the University of Georgia. One of the fundamental concepts that we discuss is how curvature of the Earth impacts rainfall detection. The example at a National Weather Service website describes it well,

A storm between the Birmingham (BMX) and Maxwell AFB (MXX) radars (see image below). If the storm is a good distance away from BMX, due to the fact that the radar beam is straight and doesn't follow the Earth's surface, the lowest elevation scan from BMX may only be able to ""see"" into the middle portion of the storm. If that same storm is closer to MXX, this will allow us to ""look"" into the lower portion of that same storm, possibly allowing us to detect a rotational couplet closer to the Earth's surface. From this, we could infer that given the right circumstances, the formation of a tornado is possible.

522,"On May 29, 1780, the treatment of Patriot prisoners by British Colonel Banastre Tarleton and his Loyalist troops leads to the coining of a phrase that comes to define British brutality for the rest of the War for Independence: “Tarleton’s Quarter.”

After the surrender of Charleston on May 12, the 3rd Virginia, commanded by Colonel Abraham Buford, was virtually the only organized Patriot formation remaining in South Carolina; British Colonel Banastre Tarleton had been given the mission to destroy any colonial resistance in the state. At Waxhaws on the North Carolina border, a cavalry charge by Tarleton’s men broke the 350 remaining Patriots under Buford. Tarleton and his Tories proceeded to shoot at the Patriots after their surrender, a move that spawned the term “Tarleton’s Quarter,” which in the eyes of the Patriots meant a brutal death at the hands of a cowardly foe.

The Continentals lost 113 men and 203 were captured in the Battle of Waxhaws; British losses totaled 19 men and 31 horses killed or wounded. Although they were routed, the loss became a propaganda victory for the Continentals: wavering Carolina civilians terrified of Tarleton and their Loyalist neighbors were now prepared to rally to the Patriot cause.

Under the leadership of Thomas Sumter, the Patriot militia quickly returned the terror in kind with their own brutal raids on Carolina loyalists. Carolinians went on to fight a bloody civil war in which they killed their own with far greater efficacy than any outsider sent to assist them.",mainstream
637,"A Monte Carlo radiative transfer program (Atmosphere–Ocean 3-Dimensional, AO3D) for modeling the coupled atmosphere–ocean environment has been developed. The code allows for the specification of optical properties for the atmosphere, land and ocean. Light rays are tracked as they pass between the atmosphere and the ocean, reflect off the ocean surface, the ocean floor, and off land, or are absorbed. In this version the polarization of light rays is not considered. The optical properties of each horizontally homogeneous layer within the atmosphere and ocean can be set on a layer-by-layer basis with a choice of phase functions, absorption and scattering coefficients, and index of refraction. A wind-dependent Cox and Munk ocean surface realization (with whitecaps) is implemented to model refraction and reflection from surface waves. Either spherical- or flat-Earth models can be used, and all refraction and reflection are accounted for. The AO3D model has been tested by parts, and as a whole by comparison with single- and total-scattering calculations from other radiative transfer codes. Comparisons with Monte Carlo calculations by Adams and Kattawar (agreement in TOA radiance within the published precision ∼2%), MODTRAN4 (agreement in spherical-shell atmosphere (SSA) sky radiance within about 2%) and Coupled DIScrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (COART) (agreement in plane-parallel (PP) sky radiance within 2%) are shown. Sun photometer measurements (including large air mass values) at the Mauna Loa Observatory are compared to AO3D simulations (for a spherical Earth) and suggest that a thin aerosol layer was present above the observatory at the time of the measurements.",mainstream
875,"American basketball player Kyrie Irving has apologised after months of spreading theories the Earth is flat.

Irving, who plays for the Boston Celtics in the NBA, has repeatedly made public statements in support of the easily disproved theory over the past 18 months.

Without saying he had abandoned his own belief that our species inhabits a flat disc-shaped world surrounded by an ice wall, Irving apologised for speaking about the theory publicly, saying he didn’t realise the effect it would have on people.

“At the time I was like huge into conspiracies, and everybody’s been there,” Irving said, eliciting laughs during an onstage interview at Forbes’ Under 30 Summit in Boston on Monday.

“Everybody’s been there – like ‘yo, what’s going on with our world?’ You click a YouTube link and it’s like, how deep the rabbit-hole goes.”

He said: “At the time, you’re like innocent in it but you realise the effect of the power of voice. And even if you believe in that, just don’t come out and say that stuff. That’s for intimate conversations because perception, and how you’re perceived, it changes.

""I’m actually a smart-ass individual. It’s not like I was just going around saying that. At the time, I just didn’t realise the effect. I was definitely at that time like ‘I’m a big conspiracy theorist! You can’t tell me anything!’

“So I’m sorry about all that. For all the science teachers and everybody coming up to me like ‘I’ve got to re-teach my whole curriculum’, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I apologise.”

Irving first publicly spoke about flat-Earth theories during an appearance on a podcast in February 2017.

In the Road Trippin’ podcast, hosted by his teammates Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye, Irving said “the Earth is flat” three times, adding: “What I’ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that – can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what’s going on with these ‘planets’ and stuff like this?”

726,"The search for worlds circling star far beyond our solar system will intensify in the coming weeks with NASA's launch of a spacecraft scientists hope will enlarge the known catalog of so-called exoplanets believed capable of supporting life.

NASA plans to send the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, into orbit from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket set for blast-off on April 16 on a two-year, $337-million mission.

The latest NASA astrophysics endeavor is designed to build on the work of its predecessor, the Kepler space telescope, which discovered the bulk of some 3,500 exoplanets documented during the past 20 years, revolutionizing one of the newest fields in space science.

NASA expects TESS to detect thousands more previously unknown worlds, perhaps hundreds of them Earth-sized or “super-Earth”-sized — no larger than twice as big as our home planet.

Such worlds are believed to stand the greatest chance of having rocky surfaces or oceans, and are thus considered the most promising candidates for the evolution of life, as opposed to gas giants similar to Jupiter or Neptune.

Astronomers said they hope to end up with about 100 more rocky exoplanets for further study.

The new probe will take about 60 days to attain its highly elliptical, first-of-a-kind orbit that will loop TESS between Earth and the moon every two and a half weeks.

Kepler’s positioning system broke down in 2013 about four years after its launch, and though scientists found a way to keep it operational it has nearly run out of fuel.

""So it’s perfect timing that we'll be launching TESS to continue the great activity of looking for planets around stars other than our sun and thinking about what it might mean for life in the universe,” Paul Hertz, NASA’s director of astrophysics, told reporters at a news briefing in Washington on Wednesday.

TESS, roughly the size of a refrigerator with solar-panel wings, is equipped with four special cameras to survey 200,000 stars that are relatively near the sun and thus among the brightest in the sky, seeking out those with planets of their own.

Like Kepler, TESS will use a detection method called transit photometry, which looks for periodic, repetitive dips in the visible light from stars caused by planets passing, or transiting, in front of them.

But unlike Kepler, which fixed its glare on stars within a tiny fraction of the sky, TESS will scan the majority of the heavens for shorter periods and focus much of its attention on stars called red dwarfs, which are smaller, cooler and longer-lived than our sun.

One reason is red dwarfs have a high propensity for Earth-sized, presumably rocky planets, making them potentially fertile ground for closer examination, said David Latham, TESS science director for the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

Also because red dwarfs are so small, and their planets orbit more closely than the Earth does to the sun, the dip in light from a planetary transit of a red dwarf is more pronounced compared with a larger star, Latham said.

“It's easier to find interesting planets around smaller stars,” he said.

Measuring dips in starlight can determine the exoplanet’s size and orbital path. Further observations from ground telescopes can supply its mass and ultimately the planet's density and composition — whether largely solid, liquid or gas.

Martin Still, the TESS program scientist for NASA, said more than 50 rocky, Earth- or super-Earth-sized planets have previously been identified, and NASA expects to increase that number through the new mission.

The most favorable discoveries will undergo closer scrutiny by a new generation of larger, more powerful telescopes now under development that will search for telltale signs of water and “the kinds of gases in their atmospheres that on Earth are an indication of life,” Hertz said.

""TESS itself will not be able to find life beyond Earth, but TESS will help us figure out where to point our larger telescopes,"" he said.",mainstream
606,"We earthlings have always been fascinated with the idea of finding life on other planets, and we've been captivated particularly with the possibility that life exists on one of our closest celestial neighbors -- Mars. Books, television shows and movies have all arrived at their own interpretations of what Martians might look like, from H.G. Wells' tentacled, squidlike aliens in ""The War of the Worlds,"" to Looney Tunes' Roman helmet- and skirt-wearing M­arvin the Martian. In response to all of this postulating about life on Mars, scientists would explain that the atmosphere on the red planet couldn't support life as we know it.

Then in 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was scouting out a potential Mars landing site for its sister spacecraft, Viking 2, when it came across something unexpected. While the craft was snapping pictures of a region of the planet called Cydonia, Viking 1 captured what looked like an enormous human face staring up at it. The ""face"" measured nearly two miles across and had what looked like deep-set eyes and a clearly delineated nose and mouth.

The tabloids, television shows and movie studios were quick to jump on the image, calling it real evidence of life on Mars. Writer and conspiracy theorist Richard Hoagland was one of the biggest proponents of the face on Mars idea. He claimed the face was an artifact of an ancient alien city, built by an intelligent Martian race.

Despite the apparent clarity of the face, NASA was quick to explain away the image as nothing more than an optical illusion. Shadows caused by the angle of the sun were merely creating the illusion of eyes, a nose and mouth across a natural formation, according to scientists.

True believers were equally quick to fire back: NASA was trying to cover up the evidence of life on Mars. It was a conspiracy. Find out the truth behind the face on the next page.",mainstream
661,"On his BBC Radio 5 show, that he co-hosts with Robbie Savage and Matthew Syed, Freddie Flintoff had previously said he thought the moon landings could have been staged. The presenters carried on the conversation after the show and decided to bring in their favourite conspiracy theories to the next broadcast. The cricket hero said he has recently been persuaded by a podcast called The Flat Earthers. Although, he does not think the Earth is completely flat but “bulbous, like a turnip”. The members of the Flat Earthers claim the planet is flat and satellite photos of the globe being spherical are fabrications of a “round Earth conspiracy”.

Allegedly, NASA and Government agencies are involved in the cover-up - as is Disney. Mr Flintoff believes there is “evidence to suggest the world is not round”. He said: “Now, I am not saying that the world is flat, but it could be. I know you go back in the day and there were sailors who were worried about falling off the edge of the Earth and they realised that they can’t. Mr Flintoff was asked by his co-presenters to “consider the evidence”.

They mentioned the Red Bull Stratos Space Jump when Daredevil Felix Baumgartner skydived from outer-space. Robbie Savage insisted that you can see the Earth is round from the footage of the jump. But, Mr FLintoff rebutted this, saying: “The horizon always appears flat, apart from NASA pictures. Which some say could be doctored. “The middle is the North Pole, around the outside is the South Pole which is like a big wall of ice. This is why all governments now have bases on the South Pole.

“If you’re in a helicopter and you hover why does the Earth not come to you if it’s round? To which Matthew Syed said: “Because of the principle of relativity. ""So, the atmosphere of the Earth as it spins carries around with the Earth. “In the same way, if you are on a plane that is flying forward at 100 miles an hour the ball doesn’t hit the back of the plane, it carries on with you.

Robbie Savage pointed out that Greek philosopher Aristotle said as early as the 5th Century BC that he postulated the Earth was round. Aristotle noticed that during a solar eclipse that the shadow on the moon’s surface is round, which is the shadow on the earth. But, Flintoff was undeterred, he continued: “Why if we’re hurtling through space, why would water stay still? Why is it not wobbling? Also if you fire a laser about 16 miles, if the world was curved, you shouldn’t be able to see it but you can.”",mainstream

1068,"FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) — In addition to his degree in theater studies and bass singing voice, Patrick Curran lists his 18-inch neck on his resume when applying for acting jobs.

After all, the casting notice for his current role in “Bouncers” called for “a guy who could take a punch, come back p(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)d off and swinging.”

The 24-year-old Framingham resident got the role.

At 6 feet, 2 inches tall and 260 pounds, Curran has used his burly build - part NFL linebacker, part cement mixer - to win roles as a prison guard and Little John in “Robin Hood.”

“I’m a big kid,” said Curran who played lacrosse goalie at The Governor’s Academy in Byfield and Emerson College and coaches the junior varsity at Thayer Academy in Braintree. “I’ve got some meat on me.”

Yet Curran has played some pretty meaty roles, too, like the wizard Prospero in Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” and Boston Mayor Kevin White in an Emerson College production of “Common Ground.”

He has lived a sort of double life after the kid who started playing lacrosse at age 10 fell in love with acting while playing Atticus Finch in “To Kill a Mockingbird” at Framingham High School.

“I realized then I wanted to be an actor for the rest of my life,” Curran said.

After entering Emerson in 2008, he started as goalie on Emerson’s lacrosse team, earned second team All Conference honors and was elected captain as a sophomore.

Since graduating in 2012, Curran has found steady work in plays staged by local companies including the Huntington Theater Company, Flat Earth Theater Company and Brown Box Theatre Project.

For his current gig in “Bouncers” at the Cantab Lounge in Cambridge, Curran, like the other leads, plays multiple roles. He’s Les, a bouncer, Kev, “one of four drunk lads on the make,” and Rosie who’s enjoying “a night on the town” with her gal pals.

In director Bill Doncaster’s production of British playwright John Godber’s blue-collar comedy-drama, there are no costume changes or props except for two kegs of beer.

To signal role changes, Curran raises or lowers his voice and buttons or unbuttons his dark jacket as the lighting and background music change. All the rest comes from inhabiting his characters’ lives.

Doncaster said Curran “surprises me in every show.”

“Patrick’s comic timing is stellar. He always brings something new to each performance,” he said. “When he’s Rosie and sees her boyfriend kissing someone else, he makes it heartbreaking.”

Doncaster credited Curran for “working very hard” to improve his dancing for Rosie’s character. “When I have another role,” he said, “I’ll call Patrick again.”

Staged by Stickball Productions, “Bouncers” plays Fridays and Saturdays at the Cantab Lounge at 738 Massachusetts Ave. through April 27.

Patrick’s father, Tom Curran, who also played collegiate lacrosse, recalled being “caught off guard when Pat gravitated toward acting.”

“After thinking about it, I just wanted Pat to do whatever made him happy. He’s got an engaging personality and could talk you out of a sunburn,” he said. “When I saw him as Atticus in ‘Mockingbird,’ I knew then and there he could engage the audience.”

Curran observed that his son “might not look like Brad Pitt.”

“They say it’s a hard road. If passion pays off, Pat will succeed,” Tom Curran said. “I’m not much for English humor but when I saw him in ‘Bouncers,’ he was awesome. Pat loves it. He comes home grinning from ear-to-ear after every show.”

Looking ahead, Patrick has a “tentative” offer for a Western to be filmed in the Mohave Desert but plans to audition for local roles with an eye toward getting in television or movies.

Like many young actors, he realizes he might have to relocate to California or New York to chase the roles he wants. “I’m not moving just for the sake of going there” he said. “If I go, I’ll go on my own terms with a purpose.”

An admirer of acting “chameleons” such as Philip Seymour Hoffman and Gary Oldman, he expects he might have to play a few more “blue-collar guys” and “dumb brutes” while waiting for the opportunity to show the “training and dramatic range” he learned at Emerson and beyond.

“Right now, I want to get cast and get work,” said Curran. “Even if I get typecast at first, my job is to make each role unique and wait for my chance.”",mainstream
1127,"Ignorance is the root of all evil, according to Plato, who also famously gave us a still-current definition of its opposite: knowledge. For Plato, knowledge is ""justified true belief"". That definition is worthy of consideration as we reflect on the perils of ignorance in the twenty-first century.

Plato thought that three conditions must be met in order for us to ""know"" something: the notion in question must actually be true; we must believe it (because if we do not believe something that is true, we can hardly claim that we know it); and, most subtly, it must be justifiable - there must be reasons why we believe the notion to be true.

Consider something that we all think we know: the earth is (approximately) round. This is as true as astronomical facts get, particularly because we have sent artificial satellites into orbit and seen that our planet is indeed roundish. Most of us (except for a lunatic fringe of flat-earthers) also believe this to be the case.

What about the justification of that belief? How would you answer if someone asked you why you believe that the earth is round?

The obvious place to begin would be to point to the aforementioned satellite images, but then our skeptical interlocutor could reasonably ask if you know how those images were obtained. Unless you are an expert on space engineering and imaging software, you may have some trouble at that point.

Of course, you could fall back on more traditional reasons to believe in a round earth, like the fact that our planet projects a round-looking shadow on the moon during eclipses. Naturally, you would have to be in a position to explain - if challenged - what an eclipse is and how you know that. You see where this could easily go: if we push far enough, most of us do not actually know, in the Platonic sense, much of anything. In other words, we are far more ignorant than we realize.

Socrates, Plato's teacher, famously goaded the Athenian authorities by maintaining that he was wiser than the Oracle at Delphi, who claimed to be the wisest, because he, unlike most people (including the Athenian authorities), knew that he did not know anything. Whether Socrates' humility was sincere or a secret joke at the expense of the powers that be (before said powers put him to death after tiring of his irreverence), the point is that the beginning of wisdom lies in the recognition of how little we really know.

Which brings me to the paradox of ignorance in our era: on the one hand, we are constantly bombarded by expert opinion, by all sorts of people - with or without Ph.D. after their name - who tell us exactly what to think (though rarely why we should think it). On the other hand, most of us are woefully inadequate to practice the venerable and vital art of baloney detection (or, more politely, critical thinking), which is so necessary in modern society.

You can think of the paradox in another way: we live in an era when knowledge - in the sense of information - is constantly available in real time through computers, smart phones, electronic tablets, and book readers. And yet we still lack the basic skills of reflecting on such information, of sifting through the dirt to find the worthy nuggets. We are ignorant masses awash in information.

Of course, it may be that humanity has always been short on critical thinking. That's why we keep allowing ourselves to be talked into supporting unjust wars (not to mention actually dying in them), or voting for people whose main job seems to be to amass as much wealth for the rich as they can get away with. It is also why so many people are duped by exceedingly costly sugar pills sold to them by homeopathic ""doctors"", and why we follow the advice of celebrities (rather than real doctors) about whether to vaccinate our kids.

But the need for critical thinking has never been as pressing as in the Internet era. At least in developed countries - but increasingly in underdeveloped ones as well - the problem is no longer one of access to information, but of the lack of ability to process and make sense of that information.

Unfortunately, colleges, high schools, and even elementary schools are unlikely to mandate introductory courses in critical thinking on their own. Education has increasingly been transformed into a commodity system, in which the ""customers"" (formerly students) are kept happy with personalized curricula while being prepared for the job market (rather than being prepared to be responsible human beings and citizens).

This can and must change, but it requires a grassroots movement that uses blogs, online magazines and newspapers, book clubs and meet-up clubs, and anything else that might work to promote educational opportunities to develop critical-thinking skills. After all, we do know that it is our future.

721,"BOULDER CITY, Nev. — Against the desert backdrop of the nation’s largest solar energy installation, President Obama on Wednesday assailed Republican critics of his clean energy policies as “the flat earth society” even as he sought to demonstrate his own support for domestic oil and gas production.

Before Mr. Obama spoke at the solar plant southeast of Las Vegas, administration officials previewed an executive order that the president will announce on Thursday in Oklahoma to expedite federal permits for the southern half of the Keystone XL oil pipeline to the Gulf of Mexico. Republicans derided the move as a political stunt, intended only to blunt their criticism of Mr. Obama’s decision in January to reject, on environmental grounds, a northern leg of the pipeline from Canada to Cushing, Okla.

The partisan back and forth reflected the election-year stakes as Americans’ disgust with high gasoline prices has chipped at Mr. Obama’s approval ratings in polls and given Republicans a renewed sense of his vulnerability on pocketbook issues at a time when the economy otherwise has been improving.

Members of the Flat Earth Society claim to believe the Earth is flat. Walking around on the planet's surface, it looks and feels flat, so they deem all evidence to the contrary, such as satellite photos of Earth as a sphere, to be fabrications of a ""round Earth conspiracy"" orchestrated by NASA and other government agencies.

The belief that the Earth is flat has been described as the ultimate conspiracy theory. According to the Flat Earth Society's leadership, its ranks have grown by 200 people (mostly Americans and Britons) per year since 2009. Judging by the exhaustive effort flat-earthers have invested in fleshing out the theory on their website, as well as the staunch defenses of their views they offer in media interviews and on Twitter, it would seem that these people genuinely believe the Earth is flat.

But in the 21st century, can they be serious? And if so, how is this psychologically possible?

First, a brief tour of the worldview of a flat-earther: While writing off buckets of concrete evidence that Earth is spherical, they readily accept a laundry list of propositions that some would call ludicrous. The leading flat-earther theory holds that Earth is a disc with the Arctic Circle in the center and Antarctica, a 150-foot-tall wall of ice, around the rim. NASA employees, they say, guard this ice wall to prevent people from climbing over and falling off the disc. (In keeping with their skepticism of NASA, known flat-earther conspiracy theorist Nathan Thompson recently approached a man he said was a NASA employee in a Starbucks in mid-May 2017. In a YouTube video of the exchange, Thompson, founder of the Official Flat Earth and Globe Discussion page, shouted that he had proof the Earth is flat — apparently saying an astronaut drowning was that proof — and that NASA is ""lying."")

Earth's day and night cycle is explained by positing that the sun and moon are spheres measuring 32 miles (51 kilometers) that move in circles 3,000 miles (4,828 km) above the plane of the Earth. (Stars, they say, move in a plane 3,100 miles up.) Like spotlights, these celestial spheres illuminate different portions of the planet in a 24-hour cycle. Flat-earthers believe there must also be an invisible ""antimoon"" that obscures the moon during lunar eclipses.

Furthermore, Earth's gravity is an illusion, they say. Objects do not accelerate downward; instead, the disc of Earth accelerates upward at 32 feet per second squared (9.8 meters per second squared), driven up by a mysterious force called dark energy. Currently, there is disagreement among flat-earthers about whether or not Einstein's theory of relativity permits Earth to accelerate upward indefinitely without the planet eventually surpassing the speed of light. (Einstein's laws apparently still hold in this alternate version of reality.)

As for what lies underneath the disc of Earth, this is unknown, but most flat-earthers believe it is composed of ""rocks."" [Religion and Science: 6 Visions of Earth's Core]

Then, there's the conspiracy theory: Flat-earthers believe photos of the globe are photoshopped; GPS devices are rigged to make airplane pilots think they are flying in straight lines around a sphere when they are actually flying in circles above a disc. The motive for world governments' concealment of the true shape of the Earth has not been ascertained, but flat-earthers believe it is probably financial. ""In a nutshell, it would logically cost much less to fake a space program than to actually have one, so those in on the Conspiracy profit from the funding NASA and other space agencies receive from the government,"" the flat-earther website's FAQ page explains.

Who believes the Earth is flat?

Flat-earth believers are not relegated to the hidden corners of the universe: Plenty of celebs have been quite vocal with their beliefs. For instance, on Jan. 25, 2016, rapper-singer Bobby Ray Simmons Jr. (known as B.o.B) released a track called ""Flatline"" in which he disses astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, after the two had a Twitter battle over the spherical-ness of the planet. B.o.B is convinced Earth is flat. A day earlier, the rapper tweeted: ""No matter how high in elevation you are... the horizon is always eye level ... sorry cadets... I didn't wanna believe it either.""

And then there's Shaq. In a podcast that aired on Feb. 27, 2017, former NBA player Shaquille O'Neal proclaimed our home planet is flat, saying that when he drives from Florida to California ""it's flat to me."" Shaq later said he was just kidding. [5 Scientific Rebuttals of Shaq's Flat-Earth Claims]

Some believers have gotten creative in their quest to prove a flat planet: Conspiracy theorist D. Marble posted on YouTube on May 1, 2017, that he brought a spirit level aboard a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina to Seattle, Washington, to see whether the plane's nose would dip to ""compensate for curvature"" of the Earth, he said. On the video, he said: ""I recorded a 23 minute and 45 second time-lapse, which by those measurements means the plane travelled a little over 203 miles. According to Spherical Trigonometry given to explain the Heliocentric model, this should have resulted in the compensation of 5 miles of curvature. As you'll see there was no measurable compensation for curvature."" (The air bubble in his level remained centered, which he said proves the Earth is flat.)

The theory follows from a mode of thought called the ""Zetetic Method,"" an alternative to the scientific method, developed by a 19th-century flat-earther, in which sensory observations reign supreme. ""Broadly, the method places a lot of emphasis on reconciling empiricism and rationalism, and making logical deductions based on empirical data,"" Flat Earth Society vice president Michael Wilmore, an Irishman, told Life's Little Mysteries. In Zetetic astronomy, the perception that Earth is flat leads to the deduction that it must actually be flat; the antimoon, NASA conspiracy and all the rest of it are just rationalizations for how that might work in practice.

Those details make the flat-earthers' theory so elaborately absurd it sounds like a joke, but many of its supporters genuinely consider it a more plausible model of astronomy than the one found in textbooks. In short, they aren't kidding. [50 Amazing Facts About Planet Earth]

""The question of belief and sincerity is one that comes up a lot,"" Wilmore said. ""If I had to guess, I would probably say that at least some of our members see the Flat Earth Society and Flat Earth Theory as a kind of epistemological exercise, whether as a critique of the scientific method or as a kind of 'solipsism for beginners.' There are also probably some who thought the certificate would be kind of funny to have on their wall. That being said, I know many members personally, and I am fully convinced of their belief.""

Wilmore counts himself among the true believers. ""My own convictions are a result of philosophical introspection and a considerable body of data that I have personally observed, and which I am still compiling,” he said.

Strangely, Wilmore and the society's president, a 35-year-old Virginia-born Londoner named Daniel Shenton, both think the evidence for global warming is strong, despite much of this evidence coming from satellite data gathered by NASA, the kingpin of the ""round Earth conspiracy."" They also accept evolution and most other mainstream tenets of science.

As inconceivable as their belief system seems, it doesn't really surprise experts. Karen Douglas, a psychologist at the University of Kent in the United Kingdom who studies the psychology of conspiracy theories, says flat-earthers' beliefs cohere with those of other conspiracy theorists she has studied.

""It seems to me that these people do generally believe that the Earth is flat. I'm not seeing anything that sounds as if they're just putting that idea out there for any other reason,"" Douglas told Live Science.

She said all conspiracy theories share a basic thrust: They present an alternative theory about an important issue or event, and construct an (often) vague explanation for why someone is covering up that ""true"" version of events. ""One of the major points of appeal is that they explain a big event but often without going into details,"" she said. ""A lot of the power lies in the fact that they are vague.""

The self-assured way in which conspiracy theorists stick to their story imbues that story with special appeal. After all, flat-earthers are more adamant that the Earth is flat than most people are that the Earth is round (probably because the rest of us feel we have nothing to prove). ""If you're faced with a minority viewpoint that is put forth in an intelligent, seemingly well-informed way, and when the proponents don't deviate from these strong opinions they have, they can be very influential. We call that minority influence,"" Douglas said.

In a study published online March 5, 2014, in the American Journal of Political Science, Eric Oliver and Tom Wood, political scientists at the University of Chicago, found that about half of Americans endorse at least one conspiracy theory, from the notion that 9/11 was an inside job to the JFK conspiracy. ""Many people are willing to believe many ideas that are directly in contradiction to a dominant cultural narrative,"" Oliver told Live Science. He says conspiratorial belief stems from a human tendency to perceive unseen forces at work, known as magical thinking. [Top 10 Unexplained Phenomena]

However, flat-earthers don't fit entirely snugly in this general picture. Most conspiracy theorists adopt many fringe theories, even ones that contradict each other. Meanwhile, flat-earthers' only hang-up is the shape of the Earth. ""If they were like other conspiracy theorists, they should be exhibiting a tendency toward a lot of magical thinking, such as believing in UFOs, ESP, ghosts, the Devil, or other unseen, intentional forces,"" Oliver wrote in an email. ""It doesn't sound like they do, which makes them very anomalous relative to most Americans who believe in conspiracy theories.""

588,"It was a cliffhanger. Madonna had been in Tel Aviv since Wednesday and occupied the entire top floor of one of the city's luxury hotels. Rumor had it that the Russian delegation to the Eurovision Song Contest had to relocate to make room for her entourage of roughly 100 people.



Still, for days, the contract hadn't been signed. Would she or wouldn't she? Only after midnight Thursday did Jon Ola Sand finally confirm that the Queen of Pop would perform at Eurovision. In interviews up to that point, the European Broadcasting Union's executive supervisor had been quiet, but firm: ""No contract, no appearance.""

Jon Ola Sand is perhaps the world's only impresario who could afford not to worry about whether Madonna might appear or not: He is in charge of the world's biggest music show — with an estimated 200 million viewers — and there could be no doubt that the show would go on.

It did. After all 26 competing countries had performed and votes from the television audience were coming in, Madonna graced the stage sporting long blonde braids, a silver eyepatch and a silver outfit.

Interviewed by the host of the event, Madonna was then asked whether she was enjoying Tel Aviv. ""Sure,"" she replied drily, ""I go to my hotel, to rehearsal. I look at the beach."" And what would she like to say to the participants? ""To get here was not easy. You have a dream and make many sacrifices to earn your way to this place. That makes you a winner, no matter what happens.""

Then she continued, ""Never underestimate the power of music to bring everything together.""

The Queen of Pop then sang two numbers: ""Like a Prayer,"" her huge hit from 1989, and ""Future.""

In ""Like a Prayer,"" she was backed up by a 35-member chorus, and in ""Future,"" Madonna joined rapper Quavo in a duet. It was a world premiere ahead of the release of Madonna's album Madame X on June 14.

Her performance of ""Like a Prayer"" began with a chorus of cowled monks chanting on a scarlet red stage. The singer appeared in a black robe with a silver crown, then descended the stage as she sang the 30-year-old song, sometimes off-key, proving that the performance was authentic and not playback.

An interlude accompanied by a melody from Peter Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker followed before the new rap tune unfolded. ""Everyone is coming to the future,"" she rapped to a piercing electronic beat, later joined by her partner, Quavo. At the conclusion, the two tumbled over backward from the top of the staircase.

This was Madonna's fourth performance in Israel, the artist having taken the stage there in 1993, 2009 and 2012.

The unconventional Eurovision engagement came about after the Canadian-Israeli billionaire and Tel Aviv resident Sylvan Adams agreed to pay the fee of approximately $1 million (€895,000), knowing the event would help to promote his home country.

How we know the Earth is round

Despite myths about Christopher Columbus believing he might sail off the edge of the Earth, humans have known that the world is round for a very, very long time. The Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras left the first written arguments for a round Earth in 500 B.C. Ancient Greeks thought the sphere was the perfect shape, so it stood to reason, Pythagoras figured, that the Earth was spherical. A few hundred years later, according to the American Physical Society (APS), Aristotle dropped some scientific evidence into the debate. He pointed out that during lunar eclipses, Earth's shadow on the moon is curved; ships going over the horizon seem to drop down, hull-first, rather than becoming tinier and tinier until they disappear; and different stars are visible from different vantage points on Earth, which wouldn't make much sense if the planet were flat.

The Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, born in 276 B.C., even managed to determine the circumference of the Earth. He did this, according to the APS, by measuring the angle of the shadow of a stick stuck in the ground on the summer solstice in Alexandria, on what is today the Egyptian coast. He knew that in Aswan, Egypt (then known as Syene), the sun cast no shadows on the day of the solstice — it was directly overhead. The difference in the sun's angle between Syene and Alexandria corresponded to one-fiftieth of a complete circle, so Eratosthenes realized that if he knew the exact distance between the two cities, he'd just need to multiply to determine the full circumference of the Earth.

The mathematician had to hire surveyors to walk the distance with precisely measured steps, but he eventually landed on a total circumference for the planet of between 24,000 and 29,000 miles (39,000 to 47,000 kilometers). He turned out to be remarkably accurate: Around the equator, the planet's circumference is 24,900 miles (40,072 km).

So if the ancient Greeks had it figured out, how can anyone still believe in a flat Earth in the age of satellites and rocket launches? [Top 10 Conspiracy Theories]

The resurgence of flat-Earth beliefs started in the early 1800s with a writer named Samuel Rowbotham, who developed an entire alternative cosmology around the idea that the Earth is a flat plane enclosed by a dome of space, surrounded by a perimeter of ice walls. Rowbotham's philosophy was that the Earth looks flat, from a human's point of view walking on the surface, so everyone who said they could show otherwise must be lying. The International Flat Earth Society, formed in 1956, draws from Rowbotham's views. In the mid-1990s, the president of the group claimed to have 3,500 paying members, according to his New York Times obituary. Today, the Flat Earth Society website claims to have 555 members, the most recent being B.o.B.

Flat-Earthers don't trust NASA or any other space agency. According to the Flat Earth Society's FAQs, astronauts are being bribed or coerced into lying; airplane windows distort views to make it look like the horizon curves; and the International Space Station is a hoax. Also, gravity isn't real.

An independent satellite launch may or may not convince B.o.B that the Earth really does curve, but he may find the process a bit difficult if he doesn't accept that the planet is round. To launch a satellite (or any other object) into space, you have to take into account the Earth's radius. In the formula for the speed needed to achieve orbit, V = sqrt (g0*Re^2/(Re + h)), ""Re"" is the mean planetary radius. Astronomer Johannes Kepler sorted this out in the 1600s, according to NASA.

It remains to be seen whether B.o.B will ever get a chance to launch a satellite, anyway. According to The Verge, GoFundMe has frozen the rapper's donation account, meaning he won't be able to access the funds unless he can provide more information that the money will not be mismanaged.",mainstream
456,"In previous work an automatic detection system for locating buried explosive hazards in forward-looking longwave infrared (FL-LWIR) and forward-looking ground penetrating radar (FL-GPR) data was presented. This system consists of an ensemble of trainable size-contrast filters prescreener coupled with a secondary classification step which extracts cell-structured image space features, such as local binary patterns (LBP), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and edge histogram descriptors (EHD), from multiple looks and classifies the resulting feature vectors using a support vector machine. Previously, this system performed image space to UTM coordinate mapping under a flat earth assumption. This limited its applicability to flat terrain and short standoff distances. This paper demonstrates a technique for dense 3D scene reconstruction from a single vehicle mounted FL-LWIR camera. This technique utilizes multiple views and standard stereo vision algorithms such as polar rectification and optimal correction. Results for the detection algorithm using this 3D scene reconstruction approach on data from recent collections at an arid US Army test site are presented. These results are compared to those obtained under the flat earth assumption, with special focus on rougher terrain and longer standoff distance than in previous experiments. The most recent collection also allowed comparison between uncooled and cooled FL-LWIR cameras for buried explosive hazard detection.",mainstream
63,"Some of you may have heard the news that I have chosen to step aside from my position as Chief Strategist at USWeb. First off, I'd like to say that there have been wild exaggerations of my assertions by the press. I expected this (this whole bit of ""reverse engineered technology"" as one example has been wildly exaggerated, as anyone who actually has read my book knows, meanwhile the important parts of the book that I've truly stressed to reporters go unreported). Thus reality is transformed into caricature. Anticipating this inability on the part of the press to think and report in shades of gray rather than simply black and white led me to propose to my associates several days ago that I step aside. This is a long process and it has just begun. I love the company we've created far too much to see it take any collateral flack from my publishing. I will be releasing on the Internet an official synopsis of my book shortly which, among other things, will clarify what I have actually said and what I actually believe, as opposed to the ""X-Files"" sensationalizations reported. In comparing the two versions of the story, many of you may see for the first time a real-time living example of the ways in which remarkable ideas can be and have been trivialized and discredited. The wonderful thing about the Internet is that irresponsible journalism can be circumvented through direct broadcast communication. Joseph Firmage

 

 

 In a bizarre twist, USWeb founder Joe Firmage has quit his executive post even as a San Francisco newspaper was trumpeting his view that aliens are behind many of today's technological advances. Firmage, 28, told the newspaper he was resigning to deflect publicity from the Santa Clara Web consulting firm, which recently merged with CKS. The story quoted company CEO Robert Shaw as agreeing with the decision. ""Given the market exposure associated with his outside interests, Joe suggested that we would all be better served if he didn't have an official role with the company,"" Shaw was quoted as saying. The company could not be reached early this morning. No announcements about the resignation were on the USWeb/CKS Web site. Firmage, who was CEO of USWeb (Nasdaq:USWB),became chief strategist of the combined companies. ZDNN broke the story about some of Firmage's eyebrow-raising beliefs and controversial book published on the Web last October. Firmage told the newspaper he wants to further publicize his beliefs, which include that many of today's high-tech advancements including computer chips and lasers can be traced back to a UFO crash in Roswell, N.M. The paper characterized Firmage ""the Fox Mulder of Silicon Valley,"" perhaps foreshadowing the kind of publicity Firmage is expecting. Softbank Corp., the parent company of Ziff-Davis Inc., which publishes ZDNN, holds an investment stake in USWeb/CKS. (Reuters) - In the X-Files it would be called the case of the CEO and the UFO. Joe Firmage, who at the age of 28 has made not one but two mega-fortunes as a computer pioneer in California's Silicon Valley, has quit the $2 billion company he helped found to promote what he calls ""the most important news event in 2000 years"" -- his belief that many of today's scientific advances came from space aliens. ""Why would a young, successful CEO risk his reputation on something this fantastic?"" Firmage told Saturday's San Francisco Chronicle in announcing his departure from USWeb/CKS (Nasdaq:USWB - news), an Internet marketing and consulting company based in Santa Clara, California. ""Because I believe so much in this theory. And I am in a unique position to communicate an extremely important message. I have the money, credibility, scientific grounding, and faith."" Firmage has been dubbed the ""Fox Mulder of Silicon Valley"" after the hero of the ""X-Files"" television series, and his own beliefs seem strangely parallel to the dark mix of UFO contact and government conspiracy that lie at the show's core. Backed by his immense resources, Firmage has sought to prove a variety of theories regarding UFOs, including one which holds that many recent scientific advances including semiconductors, fiber optics and lasers can be traced to a purported alien spaceship crash in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947 that was covered up by the government. ""Outright rejection of the evidence without comprehensive review of the research in print across hundreds of books is close-minded, unscientific and indeed irresponsible in the extreme,"" Firmage wrote in one recent essay. ""It is also quite understandable given decades of government disinformation which, right or wrong in its genesis and continuation, was specifically designed to create a 'giggle factor' surrounding the subject."" Firmage's credentials as a UFO buff are matched by his track record as a computer industry entrepreneur. A physics major at the University of Utah, Firmage was 18 when he formed his first company, Serius, which specialized in writing computer operating system codes. That was sold to Novell in 1993 for $24 million, and Firmage served as Novell's vice president of networking strategy until 1995 when he left to form USWeb. That company, which helped companies to develop Internet strategies, completed a merger with CKS Group Inc. last month to form a $2.1 billion powerhouse that employs 1,950 people. During the merger, however, Firmage was edged out as CEO by a board of directors who did not see eye to eye with him on the UFO issue. Now, Firmage says, he is leaving the company for good to pursue his beliefs. ""I want to ensure that the company is not impacted in any negative way,"" Firmage told the Chronicle, adding that he was not pressured to give up his job as chief strategist. Robert Shaw, who took over as CEO of USWeb/CKS, said Firmage himself had suggested the move ""given the market exposure associated with his outside interests."" ""Joe is a visionary and he should be quite proud of what he accomplished. This move should demonstrate to the public and the employees that he's always put the interests of the company first,"" Shaw told the newspaper. Firmage has already laid the groundwork for a campaign to publicize his UFO beliefs. He has set up the International Space Science Organization to promote his views, sunk $3 million into an endeavor dubbed 'Project Kairos' aimed at preparing humanity for alien contact, and posted a 600-page manifesto, entitled 'The Truth', on his website (www.thewordistruth.org). Included in 'The Truth' are new documents from a source Firmage calls the 'Deep Throat of Cyberspace' which he claims back up his space alien theories. One of the documents is a purported 1947 memo from President Harry Truman to Secretary of Defense James Forrestal that sets up a secret U.S. government operation dubbed 'Majestic Twelve' to investigate extraterrestrials. Another is an alleged June 1947 letter from Albert Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer to scientist Vannevar Bush giving advice on how to deal with alien visitors. Firmage's departure from USWeb/CKS was greeted with a shrug by many of his Silicon Valley contemporaries, who have long scoffed at his otherworldly beliefs. ""I've met a bunch of the valley's pioneers, and none of them I know are aliens,"" said John McLaughlin, a Silicon Valley historian. ""The valley was built on ingenuity and hard work."" Even Silicon Valley's 'official' UFO organization, the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute which is partly financed by high-tech heavyweights from Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Intel, is not lining up behind Firmage. ""Roswell has repeatedly been discounted as nothing more than a military experiment,"" SETI Institute President Frank Drake told the Chronicle. ""It is constantly exploited by obsessive types who want to believe. If it's not Santa Claus, then it's aliens."" Firmage, however, was unperturbed by the lack of support from the high-tech world. ""It's the Flat-Earth society mentality all over again, and I'm here to prove my theory is real,"" he told the newspaper.",conspiracy

193,"A GROUP of conspiracy theorists who believe the earth is flat tried to explain away the solar eclipse, with some claiming it is a hologram projected into the sky by NASA.

Flat-earthers believe the earth sits underneath a giant dome as the sun and the moon travel above.

While some think their theory successfully explains the solar eclipse, others have taken to social media trying to persuade people the natural phenomenon is a hoax made up by institutes such as NASA.

Many proclaimed the eclipse was simply a hologram projected into the sky to fool people into believing in a globe.

One Twitter user wrote: ""If eclipses are real, why do you need special glasses to see them.

""Throw away your NASA CGI Glasses. Expose the lies.""

Another wrote: ""Today's eclipse was a government-made light projected into the atmosphere of the flat earth plane, these roundheads need to accept the truth.""

One concerned wife wrote on a Facebook page: ""Is it safe to look at the solar eclipse when you believe in a flat earth? My husband is a flat earther and is going to look at the eclipse in a little over an hour. Is this safe?""

Another replied: ""Its perfectly safe. The whole thing is a NASA hologram.""

A Twitter user wrote: ""Remember, NASA doesn't want you to look at the eclipse because it proves Flat Earth. Stand with me and other #FlatEarthers and stare directly.""

Looking directly at a solar eclipse is dangerous and could burn the retina, causing short-term blindness or permanent damage to the eye.

Eclipse glasses can block almost all the harmful rays during the natural phenomenon.

Others who were curious about the strange theory flocked to the Flat Earth Society's Twitter page to bombard the group with questions.

According to the society, which was founded in 1956 by Samuel Shenton, an eclipse can happen even if the world is flat.

They claim to believe the world is flat due to ""evidence-based inquiry"" on Earth.

In a rather bemused tweet, they said: ""We're getting *so many* questions about the eclipse. Apparently round earthers are really struggling with this one.""

The idea that the world is flat was the dominant theory from ancient times until the Rennaissance, when Magellan successfully sailed around the world.

Since the 16th century, flat earth theory has been in decline and is considered a pseudoscience.

In July, 2018, he attacked the family's 11-year-old son when they were home alone, pushing him to the ground and stabbing him in the throat with a 15 cm blade while yelling, ""Die! Die! Die!""

Abdulrahman would later tell prosecutors that he had a video of himself naked on his cell phone, which his victim's mother had somehow seen, and the attempted killing was an act of retribution.

1249,"On June 24, 1947, the civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine objects, glowing bright blue-white, flying in a “V” formation over Washington State’s Mount Rainier. He estimated their flight speed at 1,700 mph and compared their motion to “a saucer if you skip it across water,” which became the origin of the soon-to-be popular term “flying saucer.”

Though reports of various types of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) had existed for hundreds of years, Arnold’s sighting–combined with a highly publicized UFO incident that took place later that summer near Roswell, New Mexico–sparked a frenzy of interest in otherworldly visitors and an entire new subculture, known as “ufology,” that would be vividly represented in movies in the decades to come.

The Day the Earth Stood Still

One of the first notable examples of Hollywood’s depiction of the UFO phenomenon is The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), adapted from Harry Bates’ 1940 short story “Farewell to the Master.” In the film, a flying saucer causes utter chaos when it appears in the skies over Washington, DC. Touching down outside the White House, a British-accented alien named Klaatu emerges and asserts that he means only goodwill towards humankind; he wants to gather the world’s leaders together to deliver an important message.

Rebuffed by suspicious U.S. authorities, Klaatu befriends Helen and her young son, who introduce him to a prominent scientist, Professor Barnhardt. When Klaatu is shot and killed by the military, only Helen is able to give a key order to Klaatu’s faithful robot servant, Gort, in order to resurrect his master. Alive again, Klaatu is finally able to deliver his message to mankind: The development of atomic weapons on Earth has been noted by the Galactic Federation, which will not stand for their misuse. The mighty Gort will serve as a planetary policeman, with the authority to destroy the world if things get out of hand.

The Day the Earth Stood Still and its rather pessimistic ending–according to Klaatu, the Earth has only two choices: live in peace, but under constant supervision from another civilization, or choose conflict, and be obliterated–can only be fully understood against the backdrop of the Cold War-era United States, when anti-Communist hysteria was sweeping the country, stirred up by Senator Joseph McCarthy and his House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAAC). The depiction of the media’s coverage of Klaatu’s arrival and stay on Earth in the film reflected coverage of the Communist threat in the popular media at the time, as the polite, erudite Klaatu is characterized as a “monster” and a “menace” that “must be tracked down like a wild animal…and destroyed.”

Some saw the film’s peace-loving message as political propaganda, pointing to the participation of one of the actors, Sam Jaffe, who was accused of Communist sympathies and later placed on Hollywood’s infamous blacklist. In the end, the film stands up not only as an interesting milestone in the development of ufology, but as a monumental science fiction film in its own right.

Red Scare-era America also embraced the classic Oscar-winning movie The War of the Worlds, based on H.G. Wells’s novel, which took a more sinister view of invaders from another planet. A radio dramatization of the novel by Orson Welles, beginning with a series of news bulletins that suggested an actual Martian invasion was in progress, caused mass hysteria when it was broadcast on Halloween of 1938. As the 1953 film opens, the narrator intones that with their own natural resources being exhausted, the inhabitants of Mars–the Red Planet–are looking to Earth to continue their civilization.

Dr. Clayton Forrester, a famous scientist, rushes to the scene after a molten hot meteor-like object lands in the California countryside. It turns out to be an alien spacecraft, and its occupants viciously kill three men who approach the craft in friendly greeting. The military is alerted, but human weapons are powerless against the strange ships, which have begun landing all over the world.

Forrester and his love interest, Sylvia Van Buren, struggle to evade the Martians, who (in a radical departure from the human-like Klaatu) are portrayed as smallish brown creatures with three-fingered hands (to match their tripod-like ships) and a single large “electronic eye” glowing red, blue and green. Military forces around the world hit the Martians with all their firepower–even the deadly A-bomb–to no avail. In the end, the all-powerful aliens begin dying when they try to emerge from their spacecraft. As narrator puts it, they are “killed by the littlest things which God in his wisdom had put upon this earth”–bacteria.

The popularity of The War of the Worlds and The Day the Earth Stood Still, as well as that of a number of other films, including The Thing From Another World (1951), Earth Versus the Flying Saucers (1956) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) helped make the 1950s a watershed decade for ufology. One of the most high-profile UFO incidents of the decade involved George Adamski, who claimed to have met a friendly visitor from Venus in the California desert on November 20, 1952.

Adamski became a kind of hero to the budding ufology movement, but some have argued that he was less than honest, and that much of his story bears strong similarities to aspects of films such as The Day the Earth Stood Still. This was especially true of his account of the extraordinarily human-like alien, who according to Adamski radiated a “feeling of infinite understanding and kindness, with supreme humility.”

Another notable “contactee” incident came in the early 1960s, when the New Hampshire couple Betty and Barney Hill claimed to have been abducted by aliens. In the investigation of the case, the Hills’ ongoing accounts of the abduction–retrieved partially through hypnosis–were also found to bear strong parallels with various media representations of alien invasions, including the 1953 film Invaders from Mars and an episode of the science fiction anthology television program, ""The Outer Limits.""

By the mid-1970s, UFOs and the surrounding subculture had not lost their momentum as a popular distraction; even President Jimmy Carter, elected in 1976, claimed to have seen a UFO. In 1977, Columbia Pictures released Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind, with a massive advertising push touting the movie’s tagline: “Watch the Skies.”

Based on The UFO Experience by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the scientific adviser to three UFO studies conducted by the U.S. Air Force, the film depicts many aspects of actual UFO incidents reported to Hynek, though many details and circumstances were manipulated for maximum dramatic effect. Set in the present day, the movie opens with the arrival of a French scientist, Lacombe, in the Mexican desert, where strange sightings and sounds have been reported to have come from the sky. The team later investigates similar occurrences in Malaysia and India, eventually piecing together a system for communicating with the UFOs and learning the coordinates of their next landing.

Meanwhile, in Indiana, electrical repairman Roy Neary meets Jillian and her young son, Barry, when all three come into contact with the same brilliant flying objects. Barry is abducted by cosmic visitors, while Jillian and Neary become obsessed with the same mysterious shape, a pyramid-like form with a flat top. When they see news reports of a mass evacuation of the area around Devil’s Tower in Wyoming–an evacuation that the Army achieved by faking reports of a poisonous gas leak–both recognize the peak as the strange shape they have been envisioning. Once they arrive, they realize a number of other people around the country have had the same vision; all of them have experienced a “close encounter.” Neary and Jillian escape the Army’s supervision and are able to witness the climactic spectacle: the first human contact made with the UFOs and their occupants.

Some conspiracy-minded ufologists viewed Close Encounters as a concerted effort masterminded by the U.S. government to introduce the public to the concept of friendly aliens. The aliens depicted in the film are decidedly more benign than any previous incarnations: child-size, with large heads and protruding bellies, they have largely featureless faces with deep-set eyes. They return their human captives, including Barry, unharmed. At the end, after Lacombe makes the hand signals he has devised to communicate, the lead alien actually seems to smile before heading back onto his ship, taking Neary back with him as an ambassador from Earth.

The success of Spielberg’s film made an immediate and international impact: when a United Nations meeting was convened in late 1977 to discuss UFOs, delegates were shown Close Encounters as a talking point. In January 1979, the British House of Lords even held a three-hour-long debate on the subject of UFOs and a motion (eventually defeated) that the British government should make public what it knew about them.

The vision of aliens as friendly, even cuddly beings was further enhanced in movies like Spielberg’s E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and Ron Howard’s Cocoon (1985). It was a far different vision, however, that would inform the next generation of UFO-themed movies a decade later. The biggest of these, Independence Day, arrived in July 1996 amid a frenzy of anticipation. In the movie, the scientist David Levinson joins forces with Steve Hiller, a U.S. Marine Corps pilot, to spearhead the defeat of a menacing army of aliens in flying crafts that are targeting Earth’s major cities. When the alien ships turn out to be satellites sent by a massive mother ship hovering above Earth, Hiller and Levinson are sent to plant a nuclear device on the mother ship to destroy it, while President Bill Whitmore commands an attack by U.S. fighter jets on the alien satellite ships near the classified Area 51, in Roswell, New Mexico.

A blockbuster hit dismissed by many critics as a poorly written, special effects-laden knock-off of The War of the Worlds, Independence Day marked a return of the view of aliens as hostile invaders seeking to destroy the Earth. In a moment of pointed humor, it portrays a group of giddy ufologists who gather under the alien’s ship ready to celebrate the arrival of Close Encounter-style friendly aliens, only to be massacred. Independence Day also reflected the continuing public fascination with the idea of an alien invasion, and specifically with the mystery surrounding the Roswell site in New Mexico, long believed to be the center of all the information that the government and military are hiding about UFOs. This fascination was also a central focus of the popular TV series ""The X-Files"" (1993-2002) and other hit movies, such as Men In Black (1997).

In 2005, Steven Spielberg–the creator of E.T., decidedly film’s cutest and friendliest alien–declared that the time was ripe for his updated version of the ultimate hostile-alien-invader movie, The War of the Worlds. The film, starring Tom Cruise, is not a faithful remake of the 1953 version, or of Wells’s novel, but its central plot line and message remain consistent–a race of intelligent, merciless extra-terrestrials are invading the Earth, and must be defeated to avoid the destruction of the human race.

The shadowy nature of the enemy in Spielberg’s War of the Worlds–the aliens are “tripods,” and not specifically Martians–suggests the changed nature of the threats facing Western society today. Compared with a nation (Nazi Germany, in the case of the Orson Welles broadcast in 1938, or the Soviet Union, in the case of the 1953 film), the lurking enemy of today–terrorism–is shadowy, evasive and indistinct. But the threat is still there–and so is the public’s fascination with the idea of UFOs and alien invaders, six decades after Kenneth Arnold’s sighting turned peoples’ eyes to the skies. If history is any guide, it is a fascination Hollywood will continue to reflect–and exploit–for years to come.

782,"HONG KONG - With tensions mounting over maritime disputes in the South China Sea, the cause of the problem, at least in part, is believed to lie at the bottom of the water. But it is still unclear exactly how much oil and natural gas lurk beneath the surface.

Along with fishing and lucrative shipping routes, oil and gas reserves are often cited as a major reason for the disagreements over which country owns which patch of water, including China, which claims nearly all of the South China Sea.

But how much oil and gas really exist is still a question mark, according to Carl Thayer, a Professor Emeritas at Australia’s National Defense Academy.

“No one has done the really hard work scientifically. These are estimates, because there has been an interruption to oil exploration efforts in the past, the cable cutting incidents in the past, ships have been forced out of water by the Philippines that have been contested by China,” he said.

China has said that the sea holds 130 billion barrels of oil. U.S. estimates are more conservative. The U.S. Energy Information Administration says the sea likely holds just 11 billion barrels of oil, and 190 trillion cubic meters of natural gas.

Most of the oil and gas reserves are in undisputed waters, and are close to the shoreline of Malaysia, which has an estimated 5 billion barrels of oil in its waters. Vietnam is believed to have 3 billion barrels and China has 1.3 billion barrels.

“There are reserves, and there are commercial grade reserves, meaning if they can be recovered profitably, or if they can be recovered and then transported at a reasonable price to be profitable. They are unproven because they are deep in the sea, and there are a lot of technical barriers for surveillance,” said Yanmei Xie, a Beijing-based security analyst with the International Crisis Group.

But, he added, surveillance comes with real political risk, since many areas are disputed.

While territorial disputes have scared some oil companies away, China is seemingly undeterred. Beijing last month placed an oil rig in waters also claimed by Vietnam. The last time China placed a rig in disputed waters, it prompted mass, public protests in Vietnam.

While the vast resources in the sea are unproven, and so far inaccessible, the strategic value of the waterway is certain.

More than $5 trillion in goods pass through the waterway every year. Two thirds of South Korea’s energy supplies, nearly 60 per cent of Japan and Taiwan’s energy supplies and 80 percent of China’s oil imports are shipped through the South China Sea.

Wang Dong, a Professor of International Relations at Peking University, said “I think first and foremost it is a matter of territorial integrity for China, and of course China has made clear it is for the defense of the security of freedom of navigation.”

News last week that China had deployed missiles on an island in the waterway prompted criticism from several countries, including the United States. In an editorial last week China’s state-run Global Times newspaper said the missiles are ""a typical type of defensive weapon"", and warned that the government might deploy more weapons in the future.

The U.S. has said that it does not take sides in the territorial disputes, but says it strongly backs freedom of navigation under international law. Washington has sailed its naval vessels past islands claimed by Beijing to promote the idea that the waters should be open for safe transit for all.",mainstream

299,"An international research team has found the first direct evidence that the Earth is dragging space and time around itself as it rotates, like a spoon spinning in honey. This swirling of space and time around a massive object was first suggested by German physicist Albert Einstein in his General Theory of Relativity.

Einstein stunned the scientific world in 1916 with his novel notions of space and time. One effect he calculated was that massive rotating bodies like planets distort space and time. He thought they pull space and time along with them as they spin. Physicist Michael Salamon of the U.S. space agency NASA elaborates on the analogy of the spoon in a honey jar.

""If you turn the spoon, you'll see that the honey gets twisted around with the spoon,"" he said. ""The further you are away from the spoon, the less twisting there is of the honey. That's a similar process to what happens with space-time itself near the surface of the Earth. So as the Earth turns, it's actually twisting space-time around with it. Near the Earth, the twisting is greater.""

Presumably, any spinning object would do the same, even a ballerina or a flywheel, but with a much smaller impact on space and time.

Einstein suggested a way of measuring the effect. He said a spinning flywheel would impart a twist to space and time that would affect a nearby gyroscope. If a frictionless gyro is placed near the flywheel, its axis of spin, the imaginary line around which the gyro revolves, will be dragged in the direction of the flywheel's rotation.

The flywheel's impact would be infinitesimal and hard to measure because it is not a massive object, so scientists at the University of Maryland and the University of Lecce in Italy devised a way to measure the rotating impact of something much bigger, Earth, on two orbiting satellites six-thousand kilometers high. Their results are published in the journal Nature.

To measaure the exact location and distances of the satellites, they arranged for laser beams to be bounced off them about 100 million times over 11 years from 50 locations around Earth. NASA's Michael Salamon says they were able to observe slight shifts in the satellites' orbits.

""This result is the first real, solid direct evidence we have for the twisting of space-time caused by a massive rotating body,"" said Mr. Salamon.

The satellites orbit Earth so that they cross each other's paths, making the shape of the letter ""X."" Each orbit has its own plane, the imaginary flat field around which the satellite circles. The two researchers determined the central plane of the combined two-satellite system. The University of Maryland member of the team, Erricos Pavlis, says the laser beam measurements of the satellites' location showed that the swirling space and time around Earth caused a shift in this plane of about two meters per year in the direction of the Earth's rotation. Mr. Pavlis says the measurement agrees 99 percent with what Einstein's theory predicted, with a margin of error of five to 10 percent.

""Now, obviously it would have been much greater news if we had proven Einstein was wrong, but I think we are very satisfied with the present result to a 99 percent correct prediction and confirmation of that prediction,"" said Mr. Pavlis.

To get this result, the scientists had to subtract the effect of Earth's gravity on the satellites' orbits, which is greater than that caused by twisting space-time and hides it. They could do this with high precision because recent extremely accurate models of Earth's gravitational field created from data sent back by another NASA satellite.

""We believe now that the estimate is a much more correct and robust estimate primarily because of the fact that the gravitational field is much, much more accurate today as it was six years ago,"" he added.

Physicists hope that this new result will soon be superseded by data from the U.S. Gravity Probe B satellite launched in April. It was designed to measure these tiny space-time disturbances with much greater accuracy. Like Einstein's suggested experiment with the flywheel, Gravity Probe B contains nearly frictionless gyroscopes whose axis of spin is expected to drift because of twisting space-time about one-tenth the width of a human hair over one year.",mainstream
1176,"Stuart Turner (born Bournemouth, Dorset, England) is an English alternative blues singer. He now lives in Medway, Kent. Having released two solo albums, Turner formed the band Stuart Turner & The Flat Earth Society, who release their 5th album Scowl in the summer of 2017.

Though being an active musician for a number of years, and playing with a number of different local musicians, Turner's first official solo release came on Sun Pier Records, a Chatham based record label distributed by Cargo, and formed by friend and fellow musician Kris Dollimore, ex-guitarist with The Damned. Turner produced Dollimore's debut Sun Pier release (02/01/1978) in 2006, writing a song on it (""The North Kent Post Industrial Hillstomp Blues"") which received national airplay on BBC Radio Two. Turner's own solo appeared a few months later with his debut album, A Gallon of Water Makes a Mile of Fog, which one critic described as ""packed full of ideas"".[2] Turner supported Dollimore in gigs around England and spent 2006 and 2007 playing shows in a diverse selection of venues, including bowling alleys, cabaret clubs and Swedish festivals, which one reviewer described as ""scaring the living daylights out of the assembled crowd with his spooky folk blues"".[3] Turner's second album, File Under Carnal Knowledge, was described a freight train riding back bar room down at heel blues"",[4] and released on Sun Pier in February 2009.

Turner formed The Flat Earth Society with guitarist Robbie Wilkinson in 2009 to record what became the band's first album Gin & Bitters. Alongside Turner and Wilkinson in the original line-up were Ray Hunt on drums and Dave Sawicki on bass (with occasional trumpet from John Whitaker). The album was released on CD and digital download in July 2010, through the independent Brigadier Records. The band added ""steam driven power"" to his ""anguished urban blues"",[5] and provided the opportunity for live performances around the South East of England, including the Lounge On The Farm festival. Turner & The Flat Earth Society performed gigs to the end of 2010, including a Christmas ball at Oxford University. A live version of ""Murder On Gaslight Street"" was made available for free download via Medway Eyes in October 2010, whilst Brigadier Records released the Gin & Bitters album tracks, ""Shimmy"" and ""South Sea Blues"" as radio promos in December that year. Gin & Bitters was followed up with the limited vinyl EP release Weekend Hearts in 2011 before the band recorded On The Brink Of Misadventure, which was their final album release with Brigadier Records.

At this point, the band underwent some line-up changes, with a new line-up containing Turner, Wilkinson, Nick Rice (bass), Bob Collins (guitarist formerly with The Dentists), Rob Shepherd (from The Singing Loins on banjo, mandolin and accordion) and James Kerr recording a new album during 2013. At this point, the band began their association with Vacilando '68 Recordings in Autumn of 2013 and acquired publishing through Bucks Music Publishing. The new album, The Art and Science of Phrenology: a presentation by Stuart Turner and The Flat Earth Society was released by Vacilando '68 in February 2014.

Steve Moore replaced James Kerr as drummer in time for a new EP, The Gentleman's Club, released by Vacilando '68 in October 2014. Whilst recording what would become the band's 4th album, the band gigged extensively around the South East and London and started to make in-roads into the grass roots festival circuit, with an appearance at 2015's Bearded Theory festival a particular highlight. The 4th album, eponymously named, was released to critical acclaim by Vacilando '68 in April 2016 following a long period of artwork and pressing delays. The band had a two-page feature in Maverick Magazine.

With Mike Sewell replacing Steve Moore on drums, the band recorded their 5th album, to be released as Scowl in 2017. The album also features guest appearances from Rachel Lowrie and David Read (of The Claim). Some left-over songs from the album were released as a digital only release in February 2017.

14,"The flat-Earth theory has been growing in popularity exponentially of late, with celebrity endorsements including basketballer Kyrie Irving and cricketer Freddie Flintoff. Russian ISS cosmonaut Sergey Ryazansky said the prevalence of the pseudoscientific theory is due to poor education in the West. He said: ""People won’t believe in any proofs. It all originated in the West, perhaps because they are not taught the deep foundations of sciences, namely of physics, like in this country. ""I am sorry to hear it’s echoing in Russia as well. I have no idea how one can come to believe all this bulls**t.”

Mr Ryazansky said the theory is about internet “trolling” and having people on. He added: ""When it comes to Flat Earth, this is again the spirit of our time. It’s so easy to 'troll' a public figure, pardon me, on the internet. ""You are far away from him or her, they can’t wipe your nose even if there is a reason to. So, they can easily be insulted. ""I personally take the Flat Earth theory as a perfect massive space trolling, nothing more. There’s nothing serious behind it. This is just about playing a trick, waiting for what will come next, whether this or that cosmonaut will respond.

""I never get involved in it on social media, as it’s a shame to spend my precious time on explaining elementary physics to people."" The astronaut said the reason people use pseudonyms is to hide how ""dull"" they are. He concluded: “On the other hand, why not, since one is striving to play jokes, and they do it on the internet. ""You have perhaps noticed that these users are most often nicknamed, since it takes a certain courage to acknowledge that you are dull.” Mr Ryazansky is known to have partaken in two space flights, having entered open space four times in his space career.

His spacecraft ""Soyuz MS-05"" finalised its 139-day ISS program and safely returned from orbit on December 14, 2017. Despite photographic evidence from space and even though a spherical globe was postulated as early as the 5th Century BC by the Greek philosopher Aristotle, adherents to the flat-Earth theory are growing in number. Data from Google Trends show that in the past two years, searches for “flat earth” have more than tripled. There have been several instances of high-profile celebrity endorsement, outrageous stunts to promote the theory and media coverage of flat-Earth events that have helped promote the cause. A self-taught rocket “scientist” constructed a home-made rocket out of scrap metal in order to prove astronauts lied about the planet being flat.

“Mad Mike” Hughes planned to launch himself 1,800 feet (550 metres) and fly through the air at 500mph in his steam-powered vessel made of scrap metal. But, he had to abandon the launch after the US Bureau of Land Management reportedly stopped him from using public land after reading about his plans in the media.

1002,"Nancy Pelosi has suggested she will delay sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate in order for Democrats to build up more evidence against Trump and delay a swift acquittal.

Last night, the House voted along party lines to impeach Trump, a partisan move that enables Democrats to continually undermine and discredit Trump as the “impeached President.”

However, with the effort virtually guaranteed to fall flat in the Senate, Democrats are planning to delay and drag the process in yet another underhanded stunt.

Following the impeachment vote, Pelosi said she would withhold the articles of impeachment until the Senate makes rules that she determines will be “fair” to the prosecution.

The Conservative Treehouse blog describes this as a “cunning Lawfare ploy” that was a “pre-planned procedural process by design.”

“Now the delay in sending the articles of impeachment allows the House lawyers to gather additional evidence while the impeachment case sits in limbo.”

“The House essentially blocks any/all impeachment activity in the Senate by denying the transfer of the articles from the House to the Senate. Additionally, the House will now impede any other Senate legislative action because the House will hold the Senate captive. Meanwhile the Democrat presidential candidates can run against an impeached President.”

This additional evidence could include Mueller grand jury material, a deposition by former White House counsel Don McGahn and less Trump’s financial and tax records.

Knowing that the Senate will never vote to impeach Trump, Democrats plan to use the House impeachment vote as yet another tool with which to undo the results of the 2016 election, keeping Trump under a permanent cloud of suspicion right through 2020.

844,"The rise in people who think the Earth is flat is caused by convincing YouTube videos that 'promote misinformation', psychologists have suggested.

Researchers say the platform should present a more balanced list of content rather than one-sided conspiracy theories.

They said that YouTube needs to make changes to its algorithms to make their systems more accurate but also called on experts to create content to disprove the claims.

The researchers, from Texas Tech University, said that their suspicions were solidified when they went to two Flat Earth conventions in North Carolina and Denver last year and in 2017.

They interviewed 30 attendees where a pattern became evident in how they became convinced that the Earth was flat.

Of the 30 people, only one said that they believed the Earth was round until two years ago but changed their minds after watching Youtube clips.

'The only person who didn't say this was there with his daughter and his son-in-law and they had seen it on Youtube and told him about it,' Dr Asheley Landrum, who led the research, told the Guardian.

The interviews also revealed that the attendees were predisposed to believing far-fetched ideas because they watched similar videos on 9/11 and the moon landings.

Some had even watched Flat Earth videos to discredit and debunk them but found that they were won over by the material.

People who believe the idea that the Earth is disc-shaped rather than round are called 'Flat Earthers'.

A number of videos promoting the Flat Earth conspiracy exist on YouTube, but the team says that there aren't enough to contest them.

Their interviewes found themselves believers and before long were asking questions like 'where is the curve?' and 'why is the horizon always at eye level?', they said.

Dr Landrum said that one of the most popular videos is the two hour long '200 proofs Earth is not a spinning ball', which has been turned into a book that has been translated into 20 different languages.

She says that this video appears to be effective because it offers arguments that appeal to so many mindsets, from fundamentalists and conspiracy theorists - and even scientists.

Dr Landrum said she did not think YouTube was doing anything 'overtly wrong', but that the site could tweak its algorithm to show more accurate information.

'There's a lot of helpful information on YouTube but also a lot of misinformation,' Landrum said.

A spokeswoman for Youtube told Mail Online that they are working to provide more context to users about the news they watch on the site.

'We started showing notices below videos uploaded by news broadcasters that receive some level of government or public funding,' they said.

They also announced plans to show additional information cues, including a text box or information panel linking to third-party sources around widely accepted events, like the moon landing and are 'looking to expand these to more topics soon, including flat earth videos'.

'We recently announced that we’ll begin reducing recommendations of borderline content or videos that could misinform users in harmful ways—such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11.'

'This will be a gradual change and will initially only affect recommendations of a very small set of videos in the United States.

'Over time, our systems will become more accurate and we’re going to roll this change out to more countries.'

'Their algorithms make it easy to end up going down the rabbit hole, by presenting information to people who are going to be more susceptible to it.

'Believing the Earth is flat in of itself is not necessarily harmful, but it comes packaged with a distrust in institutions and authority more generally.

'We want people to be critical consumers of the information they are given, but there is a balance to be had.'

Dr Landrum said that scientists need to create their own YouTube videos to combat the rapid increase of conspiracy videos and try to disprove them.

'We don't want YouTube to be full of videos saying here are all these reasons the Earth is flat. We need other videos saying here's why those reasons aren't real and here's a bunch of ways you can research it for yourself.'

1059,"Albert Einstein stood common sense on its head when he proclaimed time to be just another dimension, like height, width and depth, and went on to declare that it can be stretched and warped like taffy. But that notion is much too mundane for Julian Barbour. According to the 64-year-old British physicist, there's no point in trying to describe time, because it simply doesn't exist. ""The passage of time,"" he says, ""is simply an illusion created by our brains.""

This unconventional theory comes from an equally unconventional man. After completing his doctorate in physics in 1968, Barbour balked at working in a university, where he would have had to teach, worry about raising grant money and persuade deans to give him tenure. Instead he started earning money by translating Russian articles into English--and did theoretical physics on the side.

The riddle of time had fascinated him all along, and about 15 years ago he tackled it in earnest. Recalls Barbour: ""I asked myself, 'How do you get hold of time? It's invisible; you can't really get your hands on it. So what is it really?'"" There wasn't any good answer. Although physicists work with time all the time (as it were), they never define precisely what it is. Barbour also knew that at least one physicist, an American named Bryce DeWitt, had managed to meld general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single consistent theory--a major goal of modern physics--by removing time from the equations. But that was generally considered a mathematical trick with no basis in reality.

Barbour thought otherwise. Every ""moment"" we experience is real, he says, but these moments exist only for that brief instant, during which time literally stands still. The passage of time is as illusory as the sense of movement created by the succession of still frames in a motion picture.

Most scientists are wary of abandoning time, but Barbour's idea is taken quite seriously by such respected physicists as Penn State's Lee Smolin and the University of Alberta's Don Page. There may even be a way to test it experimentally; a consequence of Barbour's theory is that the universe would be filled with more black holes and neutron stars than experts believe. If so, we could know within a decade whether his theory is supported by astronomical observations--and whether the ideas of time we've clung to for most of human history will go the way of the ether and the flat earth.",mainstream

The words perpendicular and plumb are common synonyms of vertical. While all three words mean ""being at right angles to a base line,"" vertical suggests a line or direction rising straight upward toward a zenith.

the side of the cliff is almost vertical

When could perpendicular be used to replace vertical?

The words perpendicular and vertical are synonyms, but do differ in nuance. Specifically, perpendicular may stress the straightness of a line making a right angle with any other line, not necessarily a horizontal one.

the parallel bars are perpendicular to the support posts

When is it sensible to use plumb instead of vertical?

While the synonyms plumb and vertical are close in meaning, plumb stresses an exact verticality determined (as with a plumb line) by earth's gravity.

784,"An ardent flat-earther has answered the age old question of: ‘Well, why don’t you fall off the edge of the Earth?’

It’s a pretty good one, so far as questions go in the world of Flat Earth conspiracies but Connor Murphy reckon he has the answer.

Connor, son of famous flat-earther Dave Murphy, spoke exclusively to UNILAD about NASA, the Sun, Photoshop and pretty much everything you’ve ever wanted to ask someone who thinks the reason you see the curvature of Earth from a plane is because the windows are round.

Speaking about why NASA and the government would lie about space travel, he said:

There are two good reasons in my opinion. One obvious reason would be money. The money raised by NASA alone since their inception is something like fifteen trillion dollars, and with that money they’ve really shown little for their work.

They’re releasing composite images and articles and telling you this is what’s happening, this is what we’re doing, and we spent seven hundred million dollars to get this photo of Pluto that we had to put together in Photoshop.

A second thing is to make people feel insignificant. It makes you feel like you’re an insignificant speck of dust and therefore you’re easy to control. Basically if you can imagine the globe squashed down with Antarctica instead of being its own continent, being the perimeter around the side. So a lot of people say that’s an ice wall. It’s more like a shelf or cliff.

There’s water above, there’s the firmament – or the dome – and there’s water above it and water below it and there’s no leaving it, there’s no finding other Suns and stuff. You can’t fall off the edge, essentially.

What about the curve of the Earth you can see when you fly? Conor said:

You cannot see curvature from a plane. The reason why it may seem is because of the way planes have to be designed. Every single window on a plane has to be round and curved because the cabin itself is curved.

You can’t have straight panes or they would explode and everyone with the plane would be done. Next time you’re on a plane, look out the window and at the wing, because the wing will seem to curve as well.

Connor believes the only reason a lot of find Flat Earth conspiracies a complete joke is because we’re taught to do so from a very early age.

He didn’t personally always believe the Earth was flat, but as he got older and delved into it he found there to be too many ‘inconsistencies with the model you’re taught at school’, he couldn’t ignore them anymore.

‘At one point,’ he finishes, ‘you have to make a decision on where you lie on it and I had to pick the Flat Earth.’",conspiracy

17,"Social distancing and early testing could have PREVENTED 95% of all coronavirus cases in China

Authorities all over the world are encouraging social distancing as a means to stop the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Now, two separate studies show how the pandemic could have been slowed down when it broke out in China if social distancing practices were implemented earlier.

To see how governments can better respond to the pandemic, two separate studies have taken a look at how China initially handled it. Both indicate that the number of infections could have been much lower — by as much as 95 percent according to one of the studies — had the country implemented social distancing earlier as asymptomatic carriers pose a much more significant risk.

As the source of the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus responsible for the outbreak, it also has the largest number of confirmed cases at over 81,000 at the time of writing. In one of the studies, however, researchers estimated that the numbers could have been as high as 114,325 by the end of February.

Early detection and isolation more effective than travel restrictions

To take a closer look at how effective China’s containment strategy was and how it could have been better, a team at the University of Southampton in England built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infections-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. The model was then combined with historical and real-real-time human movement data from location-based services run by Chinese tech company Baidu.

Using the simulation, the team gauged the effectivity of the various non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies used by China, such as quarantines and social distancing. Here, the team figured that, without the NPIs, there would have been a 67 percent increase in the number of cases. However, the study also found that had China implemented these measures one, two or three weeks earlier, it could have reduced the number of infections 66, 86 and 95 percent, respectively. This is on top of reducing the number of areas affected by the outbreak.

What’s more interesting is that the researchers also looked at the effectivity of the individual NPIs. Of the various methods, it was early detection and isolation of cases that proved to be more effective. This finding is in line with what’s happening in China’s close neighbor South Korea, which has largely kept its outbreak under control, thanks to a massive testing spree but no travel lockdown.

That said, the team isn’t downplaying the effects of China’s lockdowns on its cities. The team stated that a strategy of coordinated NPIs has the strongest and most rapid containment of the outbreak.

“Our study demonstrates how important it is for countries which are facing an imminent outbreak to proactively plan a coordinated response which swiftly tackles the spread of the disease on a number of fronts,” added Dr. Shengjie Lai, a research fellow at the University of Southampton and one of the authors of the study.

The results of the study at the University of Southampton line up with those of another study recently published in the journal Science. This study focused on undocumented cases of COVID-19 in China and how they helped spread the infection before the authorities could contain it.

These undocumented cases consisted of people who either had only mild symptoms of the disease or no symptoms at all. According to researchers at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who conducted the study, these cases can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur.

To asses the full epidemic potential of the coronavirus, the team used a computer model to estimate the proportion and contagiousness of these undocumented cases during the weeks before and after China’s lockdown of the city of Wuhan. In this model, the spread of the coronavirus across cities was then simulated using the mobility data collected by Chinese form Tencent from January 10 to 23 and January 24 to February 8.

Using the numbers extrapolated from the model, the researchers at Columbia found that 86 percent of all infections were undocumented before travel in and out of Wuhan was shut down on January 23. The researchers say that these undocumented infections were more than half as contagious as documented infections. However, they were still the source for over two-thirds of the documented infections.

“The explosion of COVID-19 cases in China was largely driven by individuals with mild, limited, or no symptoms who went undetected,” stated co-author Jeffrey Shaman, professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University Mailman School.

“These stealth transmissions will continue to present a major challenge to the containment of this outbreak going forward,” Shaman added.

In late January, China implemented a number of measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus, including implementing lockdowns of cities such as Wuhan. The researchers acknowledged that these, alongside the public’s heightened awareness of the outbreak and increased use of personal protective measures, have helped slow the outbreak down.

Coronavirus could become endemic, and return like seasonal flu

Despite the measures implemented by China, the number of undocumented cases and their effectivity at spreading the virus has made the researchers question whether or not efforts by the Chinese government would be enough to contain the spread of the virus entirely. Shaman said that he felt it was unclear whether the reductions made by China’s efforts would be enough to fully stem the spread of the coronavirus.

He then likened the ongoing pandemic to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Also known as the “swine flu,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated this pandemic killed around 284,500 people. Shaman then stated that the COVID-19 pandemic, which has only killed 3,213 as of the time of writing, would end up following the pattern of the swine flu pandemic, which would make it the fifth endemic coronavirus in humans.

The four current endemic coronaviruses, including the two responsible for the 2003 to 2004 SARS outbreak, are currently responsible for an estimated one-quarter of all colds. If this new one does join them as the fifth, then COVID-19 could repeatedly return like the seasonal flu.

“This is going to be with us for some time – it’s endemic in human populations and not going to go away without a vaccine,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, earlier this month.

Adalja also warned that the early spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. could have been facilitated by it being mistaken as seasonal flu, resulting in people not getting tested.

1122,"Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder that can make someone feel faint or dizzy. It happens when the autonomic nervous system (ANS) doesn't work as it should. The autonomic nervous system is the body's ""autopilot"" system, controlling things like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing.

The autonomic nervous system problems seen in POTS (also called postural tachycardia syndrome) can affect children and adults. Symptoms vary from mild to disabling.

What Happens in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)?

The autonomic nervous system keeps blood pressure at the right level for the brain no matter what position a person is in — standing (vertical), lying flat on the back (called supine), and sitting or reclining (called recumbent).

Usually when a person stands, the nerves of the autonomic nervous system tell blood vessels in the lower body to constrict (tighten). The tightening vessels work against gravity to keep blood from collecting in the legs. This automatic response makes sure the brain has enough blood flow to work well. If there is not enough blood flow to the brain, a person may feel lightheaded or pass out every time they stand.

In POTS, the autonomic nervous system doesn't work in the usual way, so the blood vessels don't tighten enough to make sure there is enough blood flow to the brain. To try to keep enough blood flowing to the brain, the autonomic nervous system makes the heart beat a lot faster instead.

What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)?

POTS is named for an unusual jump in the heart's beating speed that happens when a person stands. Other symptoms that can happen with POTS include:
• instability (feeling like one is about to fall)
• lightheadedness (almost passing out; vision tunnels or goes gray or dark)
• redness or purple coloring in the lower legs

Most POTS symptoms happen only when standing or changing to a standing position. But these may happen without standing:
• sweating without a cause (such as exercise or warm weather)

POTS might first be noticed after a viral infection or an injury. But it's hard to tell if one of these caused POTS or just happened around the same time that POTS became a problem. Research to learn more about the cause of POTS is underway.",mainstream
1275,"omeone at NASA released a photo that they shouldn’t have, a picture of a piece of timber the size of a railroad tie, a photo that could get someone killed. There is no mistaking that the object in the print below is a piece of wood. NASA claims that Mars is a desert planet with no life at all. NASA lies, repeatedly. Where would a piece of timber this size come from? There are vast forests on Mars, ones that are kept from the public. This piece of wood looks like it floated to its present location, being partially sunk in the soil. The ground around it is very interesting. Notice the flat rock formation of the soil and the crevices in between them. Does this look familiar? It appears to be the bed of a dried up pond. There had to be a significant amount of water in this area, water high enough to lift that railroad tie sized piece of timber and float is perhaps several miles. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed that vast regions of the Red Planet have been altered by floods. This dried pond effect should come as no surprise. This flood had to have happened within the past thirty or forty years because the wood is intact, though this is judging the rate of decay by Earth standards. Some may say that Mars did have water on it long ago and that it even had an atmosphere, which is true, but a piece of timber isn’t going to survive for thousands of years. Both of the Viking Orbiters filmed vast forests on Mars[1], though no subsequent probe to the Red Planet has shot a single frame of film showing a tree. This was by design. The Viking photographs show more than just a few trees but rather thousands upon thousand of them. These trees appear to be much larger than Earth trees, having a leaf and branch system that is unique to Mars. The foliage spans much wider than a similar plants on Earth do, rising to who knows what heights. The spacing between them could be the result of the dying Martian atmosphere. Dense forests more than likely filled large areas of Mars back in the days when it had a breathable environment. There were undoubtedly several species of trees, and different varieties of underbrush, which are now extinct. The Flood destroyed the Garden of Eden and other ancient worlds that God wanted destroyed such as Atlantis. The Ancient Egyptians spoke of a time that existed before Egypt. The Sphinx clearly shows signs of water erosion, which shows that it existed before the Flood and well before modern archeologists claim that it did. The same wiping out strategy was applied to worlds beyond the Earth. Mars has an ancient world that was destroyed, one with a face and a pyramid. So it isn’t so hard to believe that the moon did as well. Many claim that the moon isn’t a moon at all but an alien object that was placed in Earth orbit. Some have called it Luna. They claim that the moon was not mentioned in the Biblical story of creation, but it was. The moon was referred to as “the lesser light that rules the night” in Genesis 1:16. The moon stopped in the sky in Joshua 10:30 but this had nothing to do with the alien presence there. The aliens live on the surface of the moon, but this is in no way saying that there isn’t an alien presence inside the moon as well. If you take some time to use your photo editor with high-resolution photos of the moon, it won’t take you long to find these structures. NASA will suggest that you created this or that it is really part of a crater. Stop and ask yourself one question, if the moon really is as NASA claims that it is, then why are some photos classified and unavailable to the public while others are inked and blurred? One of the most famous examples of this is the Apollo 16 “Earth rise” photo in which “the Earth” is rising over the moon. NASA says that the object in the picture is the Earth and few people question it. If you think for yourself, and look with an open mind, you will clearly see that this is a UFO. This is another craft off to the left, which NASA doesn’t even attempt to explain away. The fact that trees can survive in such an atmosphere, and with much less water than Earth trees do, reveals their unique structure while offering hope for an increasingly polluted Earth. Since the Martian atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, these plants would have to thrive on it in a way much superior to Earth trees. They may give off oxygen, though I am using terrestrial vegetation for comparison, but they could give off another gas, one even toxic to humans. Seeding or drafting these trees in bulk could bring breathable air back to the Red Planet. If Mars was so altered by water, then where did all that water go? Some of it went into the soil, much of it is frozen at the poles, and a good percentage of it went into a lake. NASA didn’t need to spend all that money on the Phoenix Mission in order to search for water on Mars. All they had to do was look at their old photographs. The only way that piece of timber got to where it was is by way of flood, and the only way that it separated from the tree that it was once a part of was by high and rapidly flowing water. Based on the findings of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, that piece of wood could’ve floated for some distance before coming to its final resting place. The lake, although frozen, Mars having a mean surface temperature of -46 degrees C, must contain more than just water. There has to be some amebas and other single celled organisms in these waters. There are most likely fossils of Martian fish and perhaps even Martian animals. On Earth, old lake beds are a prime location in which to find dinosaur fossils. Why would Mars be any different? If you examine the lake carefully, especially toward the right angle, you will notice two indentations. One is large and shallow while the other one, which is located near the right edge of the lake, is small but much deeper. These are due to the lake shifting as the result of temperature fluctuations. NASA can keep telling its lies but the photos have slipped out and what a story they tell. NASA thought that the Opportunity Rover took a picture of the area in front of it, but did they honestly expect us to forget about the railroad sized piece of timber in the foreground? It’s time for NASA to come clean with the public. It’s time that they land one of those rovers in Cydonia, the Inca city, or in one of forests. The high resolution picture, which this might have come from is at: The object is on the left hand side of the montage. It can be seen in Navigation Photo Sol 118 Tom Arbino has his own UFO forum: www.ufo-secret-files.net

1000,"An accidental chemical spill at a Cordele plant caused a strong odor that’s spread around several counties Wednesday morning. Cordele police say it happened around 1 a.m. at the Drexel Chemical Company at 120 Cape Road.

They say about 40 thirty-gallon drums of dimethoate were spilled after the chemical overheated. Police said that the chemical is not hazardous, but that the smell may affect people with respiratory problems.

Two people were treated at Crisp Regional Hospital for dizziness and nausea from the smell, but have since been released. Kathy Hobbs, who lives a couple of miles southwest of the plant said the smell was so strong it woke her out of her sleep.

 National Review

 Feb. 17, 2014

America is unraveling at a stunning speed and to a staggering degree. This decline is breathtaking, and the prognosis is dim.

For starters, Obama now rules by decree. Reportedly for the 27th time, he has changed the rules of Obamacare singlehandedly, with neither congressional approval nor even ceremonial resolutions to limit his actions. Obama needs no such frivolities.

“That’s the good thing about being president,” Obama joked on February 10. “I can do whatever I want.” In an especially bitter irony, Obama uttered these despicable words while guiding French president François Hollande through Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson — a key architect of America’s foundation of limited government.

That very day, Obama decreed that the Obamacare mandate for employers with 50 to 99 workers would be postponed until 2016 (beyond an earlier extension to 2015), well past the November 2014 midterm elections. This eases the pressure on Democrats, whose campaigns would suffer if voters saw their company health plans canceled due to Obamacare’s unnecessary, expensive, mandatory benefits — e.g. maternity coverage for men.

So, by fiat, Obama has postponed the employer mandate. When Senator Ted Cruz (R., Texas) effectively tried to do this through legislation last fall, Democrats virtually lassoed and branded him.

Also by decree last week, Obama decided unilaterally to soften political-asylum rules. Refugees and other immigrants who provide terrorists “limited material support” now can come to America. So what if someone merely clothed and fed Mohamed Atta or Khalid Sheikh Mohammed? After all, garments and meals don’t blow up. Welcome to America, Mustafa!

Meanwhile, the Justice Department is working hard to revoke the asylum of and deport the Romeikes. This evangelical-Christian family was granted refuge in America to escape prosecution for homeschooling their children, which German law forbids.

So, Obama believes, those who are only somewhat helpful to deadly, anti-U.S. terrorists may become Americans, while religiously oppressed homeschoolers who face prison should get the hell out.

The transparent electoral motive that fuels so many of Obama’s executive orders seems unprecedented. The tone is also brand new. Obama’s predecessors have signed executive orders and, more or less, left it at that. But Obama pounds his chest as he does so. As he told Congress at last month’s State of the Union address: “America does not stand still — and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that’s what I’m going to do.”

While appalled Republicans sat on their hands, Democrats stood up and shouted like equatorial, rubber-stamp parliamentarians: “Hooray! We are irrelevant!”

Meanwhile, as the American Enterprise Institute’s Marc Thiessen wrote in the February 10 Washington Post, new Congressional Budget Office figures show that Obamacare will reduce U.S. incomes by $70 billion annually between 2017 and 2024. The CBO also estimated that by 2021, Obamacare’s disincentives to hire and incentives not to work would slash labor hours by the equivalent of 2.3 million jobs.

Rather than dispute these figures, key Democrats embraced them.

“We want people to have the freedom to be a writer, to be a photographer, to make music, to paint,” said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. She added that “people would no longer be job-locked by their [health] policies, but have the freedom to follow their passion.”

So, rather than expand economic growth and jobs, Democrats applaud as Americans stop working — to do watercolors, draft poetry, and take naps — while exhausted taxpayers foot the bill.

Clearly unafraid of Obama, Iranian warships for the first time are steaming toward America’s Atlantic maritime borders. Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander Ali Fadayi said, “The Americans can sense by all means how their warships will be sunk with 5,000 crews and forces in combat against Iran and how they should find its hulk in the depths of the sea.” Tehran last week also aired fantasy videos of drones blasting a U.S. warship and bombing Tel Aviv. This is how Iran behaves while it negotiates with U.S. diplomats over “peaceful” uranium enrichment?

Nearby, embattled Syrians flee the city of Homs while they and their United Nations protectors dodge incoming mortar shells. This sorry spectacle has exposed Obama’s Syrian policy as a miserable flop. So does the fact that Syrian president Bashar Assad has handed over only 4 percent of the chemical weapons that his deal last September with Obama and Vladimir Putin was supposed to neutralize. According to GOP senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Secretary of State John Kerry privately conceded to them that Obama’s approach in Syria has failed.

America liberated Afghanistan from a regime that hosted al-Qaeda, banned kites and recorded music, and built a bridge to the seventh century. And what thanks does the U.S. get? Over American objections, Afghan president Hamid Karzai last week released 65 Taliban warriors from Bagram prison, where they were being held on suspicion of killing American troops, murdering Afghan civilians, deploying roadside bombs, and otherwise perpetrating mayhem. When U.S. officials complained that these killers could return to the fight — as have other Taliban thugs, once freed — Karzai exploded: “If the Afghan judicial authorities decide to release a prisoner, it is of no concern to the U.S. I hope that the U.S. will stop harassing Afghanistan’s procedures and judicial authority, and I hope the U.S. will now begin to respect Afghan sovereignty.”

For these and many other reasons, Democrats are fleeing Obama.

“I don’t care to have him campaign for me,” said Senator Mark Begich (D., Alaska).

A reelection ad for Representative Joe Garcia (D., Fla.) boasts that “he voted to let you keep your existing health plan, and he took the White House to task for the disastrous healthcare website.”

“He [Obama] is hurting the Democratic brand right now,” veteran Democratic campaign strategist Joe Trippi told Fox News Channel’s Megyn Kelly on February 12. “The Obamacare snafus, his approval rating is declining, and his credibility problems all drag the Democratic brand down.”

Rather than resist an increasingly weak — yet ever more assertive — Obama, GOP congressional leaders hand him whatever he wants. Thus, House speaker John Boehner and Senate GOP chief Mitch McConnell of Kentucky pushed through a $1.012 trillion budget with, at best, minuscule and illusory spending cuts. A $956 billion farm bill includes $3 million to promote Christmas trees (who on Earth would buy them without federal assistance?), $100 million for maple-syrup market research, and $170 million for catfish protectionism. Boehner and McConnell sent Obama this gift-wrapped monstrosity, which was $56 billion higher than Obamacare’s original price tag. And in exchange, Obama gave them . . . zippo!

On February 12, Boehner and McConnell helped send Obama a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. (The debt ceiling was not raised from $17.2 trillion to a higher level; it simply was removed. The gas pedal remains in Obama’s Little Red Cor-debt, but the brakes are gone.) This passed the GOP House with Boehner and only 27 Republicans voting yes. The other 194 votes were from Democrats. When McConnell surrendered on cloture, 11 other Republican senators helped Democrats advance their dirty work. The debt ceiling is now a debt sunroof.

And what did Washington’s top two Republicans get for giving Obama 13 months to shop till America drops? Nothing! No repeal of Obamacare’s $47 billion bailout of health insurers. No approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline. No termination of the cure-killing medical-device tax. No votes on these matters, which would have forced Democrats to choose. This could have helped Republican candidates in November.

Steely resolve could stymie the unpopular and untrustworthy Obama. Sadly, Boehner, McConnell, and other GOP leaders are as firm as foil.

“Republicans are giving up because they know that winning is impossible when their leaders are determined to lose,” the Senate Conservatives Fund stated. “These leaders have telegraphed weakness to the Democrats and sabotaged conservative efforts so many times that Republicans now have no leverage.” The group concluded: “John Boehner must be replaced as Speaker of the House. . . . Unless we install a new leader who will actually go on offense, Democrats will never fear us and we will never have any leverage.”

Also, Earth’s sole superpower is sagging where it should be No. 1. America has slouched to No. 12 on the 2014 Heritage Foundation/Wall Street Journal Index of Economic Freedom.

“Now considered only a ‘mostly free’ economy, the U.S. has earned the dubious distinction of having recorded one of the longest sustained declines in economic freedom, second only to Argentina, of any country in the [20-year] history of the Index,” the report states. “The U.S. is the only country to have recorded a loss of economic freedom each of the past seven years.”

Regarding graft, America has stayed stable in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index. Unfortunately, and as recently as 2013, the U.S. has remained Earth’s 19th most honest country.

Thanks, in part, to Team Obama’s surveillance of journalists from Fox News Channel and the Associated Press, America tumbled 13 spots down Reporters Without Borders’ 2014 World Press Freedom Index. The U.S. dropped this year from No. 33 to No. 46. Hence, 45 nations now have freer journalists than does America. RWB calls America “satisfactory” rather than the top-rated “good.” As the report states: “Amid an all-out hunt for leaks and sources, 2013 will also be the year of the Associated Press scandal, which came to light when the Department of Justice acknowledged that it had seized the news agency’s phone records.”

The Land of the Free is governed by an out-of-control egomaniac, neither bolstered by managerial competence nor hindered by the legislature’s institutional prerogatives. In the Home of the Brave, half of Congress cheers Obama’s unconstitutional behavior, while the other half grumbles and then meekly carpet-bombs his path with white flags.

The American people have been betrayed — both by Obama and the Democrats, whose lust for control intensifies daily, and by Republican leaders in Washington, whose cowardice and defeatism have turned their guts and spines into tapioca.

America, as Paul Simon sings, is slip-slidin’ away. And the worst part hasn’t happened yet.",conspiracy
1317,"A record of success in war is a good asset for any aspiring prime minister. As defence minister during Slovenia’s brief war of independence against Yugoslavia, Janez Janša earned glory in bucket-loads.

But despite having iconic status in the eyes of many Slovenes, an ideological divide means that he is despised by others. As the country prepares to take over the presidency of the EU in January, the first of the new member states to do so, Janša faces a general election next year and his popularity will be tested to the limit.

Since he took over as prime minister in November 2004, following almost 13 years rule by the centre-left Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS), Janša has surprised many by not reinforcing the country’s divisions and shaking things up too much. A much-vaunted economic programme which promised a privatisation drive and major changes to the tax system have gone largely unimplemented. A group of young economists were brought on board to respond to the fears of many that, while the Slovenian economy was doing well, pension reform was overdue and public spending was proving a drag on resources. But pragmatism got the better of Janša, leader of the centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party. In one particularly high-profile stand-off where the trade unions came out against a flat tax rate, the prime minister backed down. By now many of these economists have moved on and business is largely conducted as it was under the previous government.

“If you look around, standards are not lower under his regime. For some, things are better, for others, it’s worse,” says Bernard Nezmah, political commentator and lecturer in sociology at Ljubljana University. “I would say life under this government is more or less the same as under [former prime minister Janez] Drnovšek,” he adds.

Others say that Janša is changing things by extending greater influence over the media and getting tough on immigrants and human rights. The government to date has failed to deal with the issue of ‘erased’ immigrants from Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia who failed to apply for citizenship within a six-month period after Slovenia declared independence. Recent problems with the Roma community, which saw a family forced to leave their home, has also worried some about the heavy-handed tactics of the prime minister. “Janša himself has changed a lot in ten years and I don’t agree with him on many issues,” says Mojca Drcˇar Murko, an MEP for the LDS. “As for human rights and freedom of the press, the methods of how the government is dealing with these issues is something I very much oppose,” she adds.

But others still say that such tensions have long existed and are not just the fault of the current administration. Where Janša most disappoints is his inability to tackle the problems created by the previous government, in particular the political influence over the civil service and the media. “This government hasn’t changed significantly the habit in Slovenia that the winner takes all. Political interference has continued and while it would be unfair to say it is any greater than before, unfortunately not much has changed,” says one diplomat.

Such divergent attitudes about a relatively brief premiership demonstrate the delicacy of Slovenian politics which cannot be easy to master for a man who had spent much of his political career, literally and figuratively, in the wilderness.

After graduating in defence studies in 1982, Janša joined the ministry of defence and became one of the leaders of the communist party’s youth wing. As westward-looking Slovenia moved towards introducing democratic reforms, Janša picked up on the mood and began writing articles in the weekly magazine Mladina criticising the Yugoslav People’s Army. After falling foul of those in power, he struggled to find work and earned a living writing computer programs and working as a mountain guide. Further involvement in the move towards democratic change, including drawing up a draft constitution, saw Janša arrested and jailed, initially in a maximum security prison. “My life came to a halt for a while. My life was limited to a solitary few square metres, with no running water or toilet,” he has recalled.

Upon his release he threw himself back into politics and was appointed defence minister after the country’s first free elections in April 1990. When the war of independence broke out the following year, the Slovenian army was well placed to fight off the superior Yugoslav People’s Army by using guerrilla war tactics. The tiny country escaped the bloodshed that became associated with the subsequent Balkan wars with the fighting lasting just ten days. But the elation of independence was short-lived and ideological divides began to emerge. In 1994 Janša was dismissed by prime minister Drnovšek, at the instigation of the then president Milan Kuc˘an, after accusations that the army was meddling in civilian life.

Janša has never forgiven Drnovšek, currently Slovenia’s president, and the incident has clouded their relationship.

Apart from a brief spell again as defence minister in 2000, when a centre-right coalition wrested control from the LDS, for almost ten years Janša was left out of political power. But the experience he gained as the main opposition leader put him in the front-line to take power once the electorate decided it was time for a change. “For ten years he was touted in the media as being a man able to perform a coup d’état. But once he was elected prime minister it was to great surprise that he didn’t live up to this and instead conducted moderate politics,” says Nezmah.

This moderation even went as far as healing some divisions over the country’s civil war at the end of the Second World War which pitted communist resistance fighters against those who feared the looming Iron Curtain. “He was extremely conciliatory on the civil war and paid respect to the communists who led the resistance movement,” says the diplomat.

Though not quite a down-to-earth politician, his image has recently been softened by being linked romantically with a young doctor, Urška Bac˘ovnik. He has two children from a previous relationship but has never been married.

With the LDS now in disarray and hopes for a successful presidency of the EU high, Janša is expected to win the elections in the autumn next year. For a man who appears to have political survival down to a tee, he is expected to be a feature of Slovenian political life for some time to come.

1083,"A new technique for unpeeling the Earth’s skin and displaying it on a flat surface provides a fresh perspective on geography, making it possible to create maps that string out the continents for easy comparison, or lump together the world’s oceans into one huge mass of water surrounded by coastlines.

See a gallery of the new maps

“Myriahedral projection” was developed by Jack van Wijk, a computer scientist at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.

“The basic idea is surprisingly simple,” says van Wijk. His algorithms divide the globe’s surface into small polygons that are unfolded into a flat map, just as a cube can be unfolded into six squares.

Cartographers have tried this trick before; van Wijk’s innovation is to up the number of polygons from just a few to thousands. He has coined the word “myriahedral” to describe it, a combination of “myriad” with “polyhedron”, the name for polygonal 3D shapes.

The mathematical impossibility of flattening the surface of a sphere has long troubled mapmakers. “Consider peeling an orange and trying to flatten it out,” says van Wijk. “The surface has to distort or crack.”

Some solutions distort the size of the continents while roughly preserving their shape – the familiar Mercator projection, for instance, makes Europe and North America disproportionately large compared with Africa. Others, like the Peters projection, keep landmasses at the correct relative sizes, at the expense of warping their shapes.

An ideal map would combine the best properties of both, but that is only possible by inserting gaps into the Earth’s surface, resulting in a map with confusing interruptions. Van Wijk’s method makes it possible to direct those cuts in a way that minimises such confusion.

When generating a map he assigns a “weighting” to each edge on the polyhedron to signal its importance, influencing the placement of the cuts or folds. All the maps are equally accurate, but tweaking the weightings gives dramatically different results.

Assigning more significance to landmass gives a map of all the continents in a line, similar to Buckminster Fuller’s Dymaxion map. Making oceans more important than land produces one giant sea surrounded by the world’s coastlines.

“Now and then you make an unexpected discovery,” says van Wijk. A map that separates land from sea as far as possible, leaving the continents marooned away from a sinuous watery mass, was one such serendipitous result of playing with the algorithm’s parameters.

“His approach was fresh and innovative,” says Kenneth Field, editor of the British Cartographic Society’s The Cartographic Journal, which recently gave van Wijk the Henry Johns award, which recognises the best mapmaking research paper each year. “He managed to achieve a projection that reduces angular deformation to an absolute minimum and preserves area – not an easy trick,” adds Field, “it was a unanimous decision to give him the prize.”

Van Wijk attributes his success to being somewhat of an outsider. Cartographers typically seek single formulae that can be used to transform the entire globe, he says, while computer scientists look for algorithms that work in small steps and can be more adaptable.",mainstream
96,"""Between me and the sky there was nothing except the high frail roof of the pandanus leaves, where the lizards have their nests,"" wrote Paul Gauguin in the autobiographical account of his first visit to Tahiti (1). Under the Pandanus (on this month's cover of Emerging Infectious Diseases) was painted shortly after Gauguin arrived on the islands in search of his famed reprieve from Western civilization.

Like many of his contemporaries, Gauguin became disillusioned with industrialized society whose intense focus on material gain seemed to strip life of its spiritual essence. Crushed under the yoke of familial responsibility, bewildered by the prosaic rules of art dealing, and stifled by societal constraints, Gauguin imagined a life uncluttered by the tedium of survival. He longed for a different world, one with just enough depth to sustain his most basic needs. Flat and two dimensional, this world would be filled with vibrant color and would celebrate the human spirit long lost under oppressive layers of cultural complexity and control.

While many rebel against civilization and espouse notions of an unspoiled haven, Gauguin set out to embody them in his life and work. A prosperous stockbroker and avid art collector, whose inventory included works by Daumier, Monet, Renoir, Manet, Cézanne, and Pissarro, he abandoned the Paris business scene and his brood of five children to devote his life to art at age 35 (2). Giving up comfort, commercial success, and artistic acclaim, he embraced isolation to know primitive idyll and find the core truth missing from his life.

He sought solace at first in Brittany among the peasants of the French countryside and then in the far away islands of the South Pacific, whose promise of paradise on earth lured many others, among them, Herman Melville, Mark Twain, and Robert Louis Stevenson. Under the blazing sun of the Polynesian islands, where as he put it in his copious writings, ""…the material necessities of life can be had without money"" (3), Gauguin articulated his artistic sentiment into original work that influenced generations to come. Synthesizing elements of his admired contemporaries, Cézanne, van Gogh, and others, and inspired by Japanese prints, folk art, and medieval stained glass, he created exuberant tableaux charged with sensuality and primal tension.

Gauguin's life as adoptive ""savage"" was one of unrelenting hardship, for the primitive idyll existed only in his inflamed imagination. From the moment he arrived on the islands, he was plagued by two of the many motivators of civilization, poverty and disease. Unable to afford even painting supplies and weakened by malnutrition and syphilis, he moved from Martinique to Tahiti and finally the Marquesas Islands, where he died at age 53.

Gauguin's art expressed his vision of the world. The edge of the canvas did not frame the images but rather opened them to wider exploration. Unspoiled nature was bountiful and generous, warm, forgiving, and open. Like his paintings, it had no boundaries, and its essence existed only in the imagination. Even as his body failed and his resources expired, its lure did not fray, nor did his zeal for it diminish.

Unlike civilized society, whose joyless monotone had alienated him, the primitive idyll had not been meddled with or manipulated. Unregulated and unrestrained, it followed nature's rhythm. Painted in startling, unnatural colors that punctuated the spiritual as well as the physical, it had a languid but steady beat. In the moist heat, laboriously outlined flat figures of humans and animals shared a communal living, even if it was not, as Gauguin wished it, altogether loving and harmless.

The prickly pandanus (screw pine), whose symbolic abundance pervades the painting on this issue's cover, is native to many Pacific archipelagoes, providing roof, sustenance, adornment, and medicine to generations of islanders (4). Filtering the sea breezes and moderating the tropical heat, the pandanus shelters the underbrush, which contains the complex ecosystem at the heart of the tropics' languid beat.

Undergrowth vegetation in tropical and subtropical areas is home to countless creatures (mammals, reptiles, birds) that sustain sandflies, ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes, whose complex natural cycles flourish in the heat and humidity so central to Gauguin's Eden.

1276,"The discovery of the AirAsia airliner’s fuselage in the Java Sea raises new questions about what caused the crash. Possible versions range from misread instruments leading to a stall to a murder-suicide.

AirAsia flight QZ8501 abruptly went off radar on Sunday over the Java Sea shortly after the pilot requested air control in Jakarta for permission to climb higher to avoid a storm. The permission was granted two minutes later, but no response from the crew followed.

The plane disappeared from radar screens three minutes later. No distress call was sent by the plane. Both facts indicated that it fell very quickly, with initial speculation saying that it could have suffered catastrophic destruction in mid-air. But the discovery of the plane’s body lying in one piece on the seabed proved otherwise.

Recovering data from flight and cockpit recorders would be crucial for establishing the truth about the fate of QZ8501, but some flight experts point out that the AirAsia Airbus A320 crash has similarities with another flight incident, that of Air France flight AF447 in 2009.

The plane was officially classed as missing for two years and was found only in 2011. The investigation showed instruments called pitot tubes froze and gave false airspeed readings to the crew. They failed to respond to the problem accordingly and didn’t notice that the plane was about to stall or to try to recover it.

No two accidents are the same. But there are similar conditions like the weather, and we must look into it very closely,” a former air crash investigator in Indonesia told Reuters.

Unlike the AirAsia flight crash, Air France airliner stalled at nighttime when the crew couldn’t see the horizon line and see that the aircraft was losing altitude.

QZ8501 was piloted by an experienced 53-year-old ex-Indonesian Air Force pilot known by the single name Iriyanto, who had 20,000 flying hours under his belt, including 6,100 hours in Airbuses. The co-pilot was Frenchman Remi Plesel with 2,275 flying hours.

AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes expressed confidence in his pilot, saying he was one of the best graduates at his military flight school. The Airbus A320 is a reliable aircraft with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs, according to a safety study published by Boeing in August. With neither human error nor technical failure immediately pinned down as a likely cause, more sinister theories about the crash have arisen.

The plane could have been damaged by a small bomb exploding onboard, John Nance, a former US Air Force pilot, told ABC News.

“Maybe one that wasn’t strong enough to blow the airplane into pieces at altitude, but maybe one that blew the control cables from the hydraulics,” he said.

An even more exotic version would be a deliberate crash by the pilot in a murder-suicide, Nance added. At least three crashes in the past 20 years were caused by this.

One example is SilkAir Flight 185, also from Indonesia, which crashed into a river in southern Sumatra in 1997. Indonesian investigators reported that they couldn’t collect conclusive evidence to rule on the cause of the incident.

But the US National Transportation Safety Board, which participated in the investigation because the aircraft in question was a Boeing 737, said the plane crashed due to deliberate input from the cockpit, most likely by the captain.",conspiracy
1346,"Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity remains an important and essential discovery because it permanently altered how we look at the universe. Einstein's major breakthrough was to say that space and time are not absolutes and that gravity is not simply a force applied to an object or mass. Rather, the gravity associated with any mass curves the very space and time (often called space-time) around it.

To conceptualize this, imagine you're traveling across the Earth in a straight line, heading east, starting somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere. After a while, if someone were to pinpoint your position on a map, you'd actually be both east and far south of your original position. That's because Earth is curved. To travel directly east, you'd have to take into account the shape of Earth and angle yourself slightly north. (Think about the difference between a flat paper map and a spherical globe.)

Space is pretty much the same. For example, to the occupants of the shuttle orbiting Earth, it can look like they're traveling on a straight line through space. In reality, the space-time around them is being curved by Earth's gravity (as it would be with any large object with immense gravity such as a planet or a black hole), causing them to both move forward and to appear to orbit Earth.

Einstein's theory had tremendous implications for the future of astrophysics and cosmology. It explained a minor, unexpected anomaly in Mercury's orbit, showed how starlight bends and laid the theoretical foundations for black holes.",mainstream
1055,"Local communities had little incentive to come to the aid of stranded passengers [AFP]

It started with an utterly unexpected text message that appeared on my phone the moment I landed in Rome last Thursday. ""Meeting cancelled. Check your email.""

Six days later and $1,200 poorer, the saga ended when I arrived home after a three day travel odyssey, only to open my lap top and read that most airports were reopening-a day before I was originally ticketed to fly home-because experts had determined that the threat to jet engines posed by the ash cloud emanating from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano was not as great as originally assumed.

Despite the hardships and costs, there was an upside to being in the middle of the Eyjafjallajokull ash cloud saga. It offered a unique opportunity to re-examine many of the commonly accepted myths of globalisation and the way it has, or in fact has not, changed the fabric of human relations.

My immediate reaction when I read the text message was that something had happened in Israel or the Occupied Territories to sabotage the meeting between Israeli and Palestinian experts on the peace process I had come to Rome to attend. Or perhaps the funders had gotten cold feet after pressure from quarters I couldn't determine.

But then my friend Alessandro arrived to pick me up from Rome's central train station, and after the customary Italian ""hello"" asked if I'd heard about the huge volcanic eruption in Iceland that had occurred earlier in the day. Suddenly the text message made sense, and checking email confirmed that most of the participants couldn't get to Rome because all flights had been cancelled.

Well, I thought, this won't last too long. At least I'll get to Sweden for a big conference on Syria in which I was supposed to participate five days later at Lund University. But by the next morning most of Europe's airports were in lockdown, Italian, French, Spanish, and German news channels and newspapers, as well as al-Jazeera, CNN and the BBC, were reporting that the eruption could go on for weeks or months, engineers were cropping up on most every news network explaining how the silicate ash cloud could cause ""catastrophic failure"" of jet engines, and I was frantically trying to find a train ticket up to Copenhagen from Italy.

That proved impossible, as I could only get as far as Frankfurt. Everything farther north was already sold out.

With Syria suffering the same fate as Palestine, my attention turned to figuring out how to go west instead of north, and hopefully get out of Europe through Spain before the cloud covered the whole continent.

Having no meetings to attend, I spent the next two days alternatingly online, trying to find a flight home, and on line at Rome's Scuderie Papali al Quirinale museum, trying to see an unprecedented collection of the great renaissance artist Caravaggio. Sadly, the waiting time was almost as long as that at the train station, and tickets equally difficult to procure. I eventually gave up trying to get into the museum; I had no choice-or so I thought-but to continue trying to get home as quickly as possible.

Walking back and forth through the hilly and often labyrinthine Roman streets, I thought about one of the most celebrated descriptions of globalisation in recent years, that it has made the world ""flat"". So argues best-selling New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman in his sequel to The Lexus and the Olive Tree, The World is Flat.

Friedman's basic argument is that new communications and software technologies, and the business strategies that have developed along with them, have flattened the world, meaning they've created more equal opportunities for people to compete economically regardless of where they live, and in a manner that neither governments nor multinational corporations are able to direct.

Veering off of Via Veneto into a side street that featured an alluring church facade, Friedman's assessment felt, well, flat. The reality, it seemed to me, was that world, and globalisation with it, are more like the streets of Rome-bumpy, windy, sometimes confusing and dirty, and undulating up and down with the city's topography.

Indeed, the disastrous disruptions to global travel caused by the Eyjafjallajokull ash cloud demonstrated that in the global era the world remains as three dimensional as ever. Events at 30,000 feet can profoundly impact those at ground level.

Of course, so do events miles below the earth's surface, as the recent mining disasters in the United States and China demonstrate. After all, most miners are either digging for the coal that still constitutes the largest share of rapidly escalating global energy usage, or for the precious metals without which cell phones and other advanced communications technologies could not function.

The oceans are equally vital links in the globalised economy; their intensified use, whether through over fishing or for dumping the innumerable waste products of the globalised production and consumption, are in fact producing disastrous consequences for the world's marine life.

Finally, my frequent mobile phone calls home to check if my wife had managed to find me a new ticket reminded me that globalisation could not function without the increasingly crowded orbital satellite system, the nervous system of contemporary global communications.

It would seem that the globalised world is in fact multi-planar, with each level having a direct, but usually underappreciated, influence on the others. And with this complexity has come fragility.

A few days without regular air travel and supermarket shelves start going empty, airlines are warning of impending bankruptcy, cargo and freight are backed up as far away as eastern Asia, and the whole ""just in time"" system of globalised production, which depends on the precisely timed delivery of manufacturing components to build products with the least waste and expense, no longer functions.

Friedman argues that business-to-business software that allows computers to coordinate production and transportation is at the heart of the newest phase of globalisation. But the ash cloud reveals that for humans, it's the consumer-focused internet and communications technologies-many stranded travellers were simultaneously web-surfing, texting, phoning, and watching television in order to find the elusive bit of information that would help them get home-that is the true engine of globalisation, tying us together across time and space.

Normally, one of the pleasures of living in Europe is that one can fly from Copenhagen to Istanbul, or Amsterdam to Rome, in a few hours. But take away plane travel and we're back to the early 20th century; suddenly, it takes days if not longer to go from one capital to another (high speed trains don't help if you can't find a seat).

With neither planes nor trains offering a way out of Italy, I was forced to contemplate the unpleasant possibility of a multi-day bus ride from Rome to northern Europe. It seems the globe has not ""shrunk"" in the era of globalisation nearly as much as Friedman and other commentators argue, nor has time and space been irreversably ""compressed,"" as leading sociologists claim.

Europe, it turns out, is still a very big continent.

Perhaps Ryan Bingham, George Clooney's character in last year's hit ""Up in the Air,"" would enjoy being stuck in an airport for days on end. Being stranded isn't so bad if you can spend the time in the business class lounge, with its free food, alcohol, showers, wi-fi, and comfortable chairs and couches.

For everyone else, stuck in coach, the airport can become a pretty uncomfortable place.

International airports and train stations have become famous for being ""placeless"", each one looking and feeling so much like the others that it becomes very hard to tell whether you've just arrived in Doha or Milan. Along with shopping malls, their design and décor typically have few if any connections with the country or culture in which they are situated, creating a feel of rootedlessness and lack of social meaning that define life under globalisation.

Many critics of globalisation lament its ""placelessness"" on these grounds. The volcanic ash saga reveals another characteristic of such placeless spaces: how quickly they can become a twilight zone, with those stuck in them largely isolated from the surrounding societies.

Of course, almost everyone stuck in the airports or train stations were, by definition, from somewhere else. In the wake of earthquakes or floods, people will often take in their neighbours or even strangers from the same town or country, as they share the large bonds of nation and culture. But the stranded passengers here were ""others"", not part of the local or national ""us"". And so, for the most part, those living in the surrounding communities had relatively little incentive to come to their aid.

Indeed, as I watched travellers - many with young children, or themselves elderly -remain day after day at airports and train stations it became clear that another supposed characteristic of globalisation, that it has increasingly ""made the world one,"" remains far more a dream than reality.

In a dozen trips to the station in three days I never saw any Romans offering to take anyone in. And Rome was not the exception. To be sure, there were scattered reports of good Samaritan behavior in the US and a Europe, but there was no significant, organised movement by locals to house or otherwise help the stranded.

Even if people were sympathetic to the plight of the travelers, most remained content to participate in the saga passively, by watching the nearly continuous reporting of its unfolding on television. Few took matters into their own hands and reached out to those most in need.

It's ironic then, that as I finally boarded a flight from Rome to Barcelona on Monday-which was almost cancelled at the last minute by the ash cloud's rapid southward descent towards towards both cities-the first article in the airline magazine was about the rising phenomenon of ""couch surfing,"" a movement in which people open their homes, or rather their couches, to travellers wishing to experience a supposedly more authentic taste of the cities they're visiting.

As the movement's main organisation, ""Couch Surfing International,"" explains, ""We envision a world where everyone can explore and create meaningful connections with the people and places they encounter. Building meaningful connections across cultures enables us to respond to diversity with curiosity, appreciation and respect. The appreciation of diversity spreads tolerance and creates a global community"".

This is a laudable goal to be sure, but despite the movement's almost two million ""couch surfers"" there was little evidence of the practice when it was most needed in Rome, Milan, or Barcelona, apparently among the most active couch surfing cities in Europe.

Sharing destinies, at least for a few days

But if stranded travellers were largely either ignored or, via television, gawked at like accident victims by those not sharing their fate, inside the train stations and airport terminals the boundaries of nation, religion and ethnic identity quickly faded away.

National identities and cultural particularities suddenly don't matter very much when you're desperately trying to get home. Abandoned by the outside world, inside the terminals people struck up friendships, encouraged each other's perseverance, shared food, computers and phones, and gave each other hints about what airports where open or where to find lodging.

Suddenly, airports and train station became real ""places"" filled with social meaning and contact. And the ad hoc rainbow coalitions that formed within them revealed the potential for solidarity when more exclusive national or religious identities are laid aside, and narrow self-interest along with it. That is perhaps the true potential of globalisation, and it was revealed precisely when the larger system fell apart.

In the midst of all the bad news surrounding the volcanic ash saga, I read a short article reporting that the massive grounding of planes prevented the emission of upwards of six millions tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, an amount that dwarfed the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere by the volcano's eruption by about a factor of twenty.

Perhaps this is a sign from mother nature-that despite her immense power, it is humans who ultimately have the upper hand when it comes to reshaping the world on a planetary scale. In this regard, the explosion of plane travel has been driven by the same factors as globalisation more broadly: the revolution in inexpensive computerised technology, the abundant supply of relatively cheap carbon-based fuel, and a seemingly unquenchable need for speed.

Its disruption offered an opportunity to pause and consider the possibilities of living at a slower pace, of buying locally grown seasonal produce rather than relying on ""fresh"" fruit flown in from half a world a way, of putting more of society's energies into supporting the once pleasurable experience of traveling by energy-efficient trains rather than carbon-spewing planes, of becoming couch surfers rather than road warriors. Of turning off the news and closing your laptop and letting nature take its course.

If I'd followed that advice, I would have wound up being able to catch my original flight home, on Thursday, with only minor modifications. In the meantime, I could have stayed in Rome or taken the train down to Napoli to visit friends. With time to wait on line and practice my Italian with other art-lovers, I might have even gotten to see that Caravaggio exhibit everyone was talking about. Sadly, it will be over the next time I get to Rome.

752,"In a December 2016 interview on CNN, Anthony Scaramucci — the new White House communications director — compared the consensus on climate change to the belief that the world was flat, Slate reported at the time.

""I know that the current president believes that the human beings are affecting the climate. There are scientists that believe that that's not happening,"" Scaramucci said.

When CNN anchor Chris Cuomo pointed that the ""overwhelming consensus in the scientific community"" is that humans are driving climate change, Scaramucci said people also once accepted the idea that the Earth was flat.

""Chris, there was an overwhelming science that the Earth was flat and there was an overwhelming science that we were the center of the world. One hundred percent. We get a lot of things wrong in the scientific community,"" Scaramucci said.

Cuomo talked over him: ""It's called ignorance,"" he said. ""You learn over time.""

Scaramucci responded: ""I'm not suggesting we’re not affecting the change, I honestly don't know. I'm not a scientist. If you're asking for my opinion.""

As Slate's Phil Plait pointed out, Scaramucci was actually wrong about there being a 100% consensus that the Earth was flat.

""The ancient Greeks knew we lived on a sphere more than 2,000 years ago,"" Plait wrote.

In the same interview, Scaramucci also brought up another controversial idea: how old the Earth is.

""You're saying the scientific community knows, and I'm saying people have gotten things wrong throughout the 5,500-year history of our planet,"" he said, then later corrected himself to clarify that he meant human history, not Earth's entire history.

Modern humans have actually been around for roughly 200,000 years, however.

570,"The year 2016 may be remembered for important medical advances, but a glance at the headlines also offers a grim reminder of the many diseases that remain unyielding adversaries for science.

Parkinson’s disease claimed tens of thousands of Americans, including former US Attorney General Janet Reno; Maurice White (founder of Earth, Wind & Fire); and, quite possibly, Muhammad Ali. (The boxer, who suffered from Parkinson’s, died of sepsis, his family said.) Pancreatic cancer claimed the actor Alan Rickman, author Pat Conroy, and singer Sharon Jones. And former first lady Nancy Reagan was among the many who were felled by congestive heart failure.

The beloved film star quietly carried his diagnosis for three years before his death in August. His family said he’d been reluctant to sadden young fans, especially, by publicly disclosing his condition. (Pat Summitt, the legendary women’s basketball coach who went public with her diagnosis in 2011, also died of the disease this year.) Alzheimer’s remains one of science’s most agonizing mysteries, with more than 5 million Americans living with the disease. Earlier this year, the Alzheimer’s community was crushed by the failure of yet another once-promising experimental treatment.

Little is publicly known about how or when he first discovered fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more powerful than heroin, but Prince’s death coincided with a rising wave of such overdoses nationally. Last year, more than 27,000 people died from opioid-related overdoses, not including heroin — a sharp increase over 2014, and authorities say the death rate continues to climb.

Along with her husband, Rory Feek, she was one half of the country singer duo Joey + Rory. Just a few months removed from the birth of their daughter, she was diagnosed in 2014 with cervical cancer, which kills more than 4,000 women in the US annually — though overall numbers have declined steadily with the widespread adoption of Pap tests. Targeting the HPV virus may also be helping, as some women with persistent HPV infections can, over the long term, develop cancer. Feek’s cancer was thought to have been cleared by surgery, but it returned a year after diagnosis. Her blog, which was read by millions, chronicled her cancer journey to its heartbreaking end, and continues under Rory’s pen.

Ifill, a pioneering journalist, was the first African-American woman to anchor a major news program — among many other professional distinctions. In her role as moderator of two vice presidential debates, Ifill pushed often-overlooked health topics into the discussion, most notably when she quizzed Senator John Edwards and Vice President Dick Cheney on the prevalence of AIDS among black women. Ifill was less inclined to speak publicly about her own health issues. The most common form of uterine cancer, endometrial cancer, strikes around 60,000 women annually, and the death rate is roughly the same as it was in 1985. One particularly cruel cause of the disease: pelvic radiation and chemotherapy treatment for other cancers.

The cofounder of the Eagles, Frey was the band’s first guitarist and, along with Don Henley, one of the principal songwriters. Media reports suggest Frey was first diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 15 years before his death in January, and that he also suffered from colitis. While some have speculated that Frey’s colitis was caused by arthritis medications — which can sometimes lead to bowel disease — others say he may have contracted both separately. Either way, those with rheumatoid arthritis will see in Frey’s battle a familiar theme: Powerful medications that bring relief from excruciating symptoms can also take a long-term toll. Life expectancy for those with the rheumatoid arthritis has improved in recent decades, but it remains lower than that of the general population.

As a member of the iconic rap group A Tribe Called Quest, Taylor rose from his Queens, N.Y., roots to become a prominent artist.

Taylor’s diabetes led to a kidney transplant eight years ago, and he continued to perform even as complications mounted. It’s a pernicious hallmark of diabetes: Many of those who suffer from the condition can function well enough even as their underlying conditions worsen, a reality that sometimes prevents them from seeking treatment or changing their behaviors until it is too late. To others the disease is fully invisible. More than 29 million Americans have diabetes. One quarter of them do not know it.

They have always been there. People noticed them before. But no one could remember who made them — or why? Until just recently, no one even knew how many there were. Now they are everywhere — thousands — no, hundreds of thousands of them! And the story they tell is the most important story of humanity. But it’s one we might not be prepared to hear.

Something amazing has been discovered in an area of South Africa, about 150 miles inland, west of the port of Maputo. It is the remains of a huge metropolis that measures, in conservative estimates, about 1500 square miles. It’s part of an even larger community that is about 10,000 square miles and appears to have been constructed — are you ready — from 160,000 to 200,000 BCE! 

 The title image is a close-up view of just few hundred meters of ladscape took with Google-Earth. The region is somewhat remote and the “circles” have often been encountered by local farmers who assumed they were made by some indigenous people in the past. But, oddly, no one ever bothered to inquire about who could have made them or how old they were.

The following pictures have the contrast enhanced to 150% and sharpened to level 7:

This changed when researcher and author, Michael Tellinger, teamed up with Johan Heine, a local fireman and pilot who had been looking at these ruins from his years flying over the region. Heine had the unique advantage to see the number and extent of these strange stone foundations and knew that their significance was not being appreciated.

“When Johan first introduced me to the ancient stone ruins of southern Africa, I had no idea of the incredible discoveries we would make in the year or two that followed. The photographs, artifacts and evidence we have accumulated points unquestionably to a lost and never-before-seen civilization that predates all others — not by just a few hundred years, or a few thousand years… but many thousands of years. These discoveries are so staggering that they will not be easily digested by the mainstream historical and archaeological fraternity, as we have already experienced. It will require a complete paradigm shift in how we view our human history. ” – Tellinger

The area is significant for one striking thing – GOLD!!! “The thousands of ancient gold mines discovered over the past 500 years, points to a vanished civilization that lived and dug for gold in this part of the world for thousands of years,” says Tellinger. “And if this is in fact the cradle of humankind, we may be looking at the activities of the oldest civilization on Earth.”——————————————————————————————————————————– 

For this to make sense we have to go back to the Anunnaki: Chronology of events (Part One).



450,000 B.C.Nibiru’s atmosphere begun deteriorating and became hostile to life. Anu dethroned Alalu and came on Terra with a craft. He was searching for GOLD which could be used to repair the damaged atmosphere of Nibiru.

(Our science reached the same conclusions without knowing the Sumerian stories. According to our scientists we can use gold nanoparticles to repair Earth’s damaged ozone layer).



445,000 BC

Anunnaki extraterrestrials landed on Terra and established their base in Eridu, wanting to extract gold from the Persian Gulf. They were led by Enki, one of Anu’s sons.

 

416,000 BC

The gold production dropped down, which made Anu come to Earth. Together with him came his other son, Enlil. Anu decided the mining to take place in Africa and promoted Enlil in charge of the Terran mission. Enki was sent to Africa!!!



400,000 BC

In Southern Mesopotamia were seven developed villages. The most important were: The “Sipar” Spaceport, The “Nippur” Mission Control Center and the Metallurgy Centre from “Shuruppak”. The ore was transported from Africa in crafts. After the metal was refined it was sent up in the orbit. From there it was loaded in ships, which were constantly coming from Nibiru. Igigi was responsible with the delivery of the finished product.



300,000 BC

The Anunnaki revolted against their masters because the work in the mines was too hard.

(My note: please read “Our true history”. The Anunnaki actually used as slaves in the mines another reptilian race from a planet called Inua – Close to Orion).

Enki and Ninkharsag had to find other workers. They took DNA samples from a female ape and after genetic manipulations the first Homo Sapiens were bred. They have been put to work and replaced the Anunnakis. At the same time, Enlil brought primitive workers from Edin, Mesopotamia. Homo Sapiens could procreate so they begun to proliferate.

To see the number and scope of these ruins, I suggest that you use google-earth and start with the following coordinates:

Then perform a low flying search inside the area formed by this rectangle. Simply Amazing!

The individual ruins [see below] mostly consist of stone circles. Most have been buried in the sand and are only observable by satellite or aircraft. Some have been exposed when the changing climate has blown the sand away, revealing the walls and foundations.

“I see myself as a fairly open-minded chap but I will admit that it took me well over a year for the penny to drop, and for me to realise that we are actually dealing with the oldest structures ever built by humans on Earth.

The main reason for this is that we have been taught that nothing of significance has ever come from southern Africa. That the powerful civilizations all emerged in Sumeria and Egypt and other places. We are told that until the settlement of the BANTU people from the north, which was supposed to have started sometime in the 12th century AD, this part of the world was filled by hunter gatherers and so-called Bushmen, who did not make any major contributions in technology or civilization.” – Tellinger 



When explorers first encountered these ruins, they assumed that they were cattle corals made by nomadic tribes, like the Bantu people, as they moved south and settled the land from around the 13th century. There was no previous historical record of any older civilization capable of building such a densly populated community. Little effort was made to investigate the site because the scope of the ruins was not fully known.

Over the past 20 years, people like Cyril Hromnik, Richard Wade, Johan Heine and a handful of others have discovered that these stone structures are not what the seem to be. In fact these are now believed to be the remains of ancient temples and astronomical observatories of lost ancient civilizations that stretch back for many thousands of years.

These circular ruins are spread over a huge area. They can only truly be appreciated from the air or through modern sattelite images. Many of them have almost completely eroded or have been covered by the movement of soil from farming and the weather. Some have survived well enough to reveal their great size [see above] with some original walls standing almost 5 feet high and over a meter wide in places.

Looking at the entire metropolis, it becomes obvious that this was a well planned community, developed by a highly evolved civilization. The number of ancient gold mines suggests the reason for the community being in this location. We find roads — some extending a hundred miles — that connected the community and terraced agriculture, closely resembling those found in the Inca settlements in Peru.

But one question begs for an answer — how could this be achieved by humans 200,000 years ago?

This is what you will see on google-earth at:

We are viewing the scene from an altitude of 357 meters.

This is not a “special” location — just one we picked at random, within the previously described area. It shows artifacts that are everywhere and we encourage you to search the area with this great internet technology.

The circular stone structures are obvious from this view, even though they may not be visible from ground level. Notice that there are many very long roads [B] that connect groups of the circular structures. If you zoom out and follow these “roads” they travel for many miles.

The fact that we can see these structures is mainly because natural erosion has blown away the dirt and debris that has covered them for thousands of years. Once exposed to the wind, the rocks are scoured clean and may appear deceptively new.

Once the ruins were examined, the researchers were anxious to place the lost civilization in a historical perspective. The rocks were covered with a patina that looked very old but there were no items sufficient for carbon-14 dating. It was then that a chance discovery revealed the age of the site, and sent a chill down the spine of archaeologists and historians!

Finding the remains of a large community, with as many as 200,000 people living and working together, was a major discovery in itself. But dating the site was a problem. The heavy patina on the rock walls suggested the structures were extremely old, but the science of dating patina is just being developed and is still controversial. Carbon-14 dating of such things as burnt wood introduces the possibility that the specimens could be from recent grass fires which are common in the area.

After weeks and months of measuring and observations, Johan concluded that it was perfectly aligned with the rise and fall of the Sun. He determined the solstices and the equinoxes. But the mysterious hole in the ground remained a big puzzle. One day, while contemplating the reason for the hole, the local horse trail expert, Christo, came riding by. He quickly explained to Johan that there was a strange shaped stone which had been removed from the spot some time ago. Apparently it stood somewhere near the entrance to the nature reserve.

After an extensive search, It was intact and proudly placed with a plaque stuck to it. It had been used by the Blue Swallow foundation to commemorate the opening of the Blue Swallow reserve in 1994. The irony is that it was removed from the most important ancient site found to date and mysteriously returned to the reserve – for slightly different reasons.” 

 * For me, the anthropomorphic stone it clearly indicates a non-human being. We know from many cultures (including the African culture that evolved from these places) that the humans were not allowed to depict the reptilians in their true form. So this is the perfect depiction of a reptilian standing next to/looking at the Orion’s belt. He clearly is a non-human belonging to the stars.

The exact location of the calendar is listed on www.makomati.com. The first calculations of the age of the calendar were made based on the rise of Orion, a constellation known for its three bright stars forming the “belt” of the mythical hunter.

The first rough calculation was at least 25,000 years ago. But new and more precise measurements kept increasing the age. The next calculation was presented by a master archaeoastronomer who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of ridicule by the academic fraternity. His calculation was also based on the rise of Orion and suggested an age of at least 75,000 years. The most recent and most acurate calculation, done in June 2009, suggests an age of at least 160,000 years, based on the rise of Orion – flat on the horizon – but also on the erosion of dolerite stones found at the site. 



Some pieces of the marker stones had been broken off and sat on the ground, exposed to natural erosion. When the pieces were put back together about 3 cm of stone had already been worn away. These calculation helped assess the age of the site by calculating the erosion rate of the dolerite.

(In the left corner we can see the anthropomorphic stone depicting the reptilian standing next to Orion’s belt. Also notice how tall he is).



If you payed attention to all my articles you will notice a trend. No matter what culture we study, everything goes back to this trio:

 1. The Anunnaki Reptilians or other Reptilian/Serpent/Dragon gods;

2. The Orion’s Belt;

3. The Pleiades Constellation;



This trio forms a more complex interlocking chain: Nibiru – Anunnaki – The Ancient Egypt – (now) Africa – The Illuminati worship – Vatican – Orion – Pleiades – Ritualistic worship – Temples and pyramids. 

 The truths in South Africa are preserved by Zulu Shamans and passed on from generation to generation.

David Icke met in his journeys a South African Shaman Zulu named Credo Mutawa. This wonderful person tells the story of the first African gods. They were Reptilian Extraterrestrials who came to Africa to mine gold. Because they needed workers, they genetically created the first human beings as their slaves. They had also interbreed with human women creating a superior race of leaders. These leaders (half blooded kings) were the bridge between the reptilian ETs and the African people.



Credo Mutawa also had a very old necklace telling the story of their first days on Earth. On the necklace there is a reptilian being that interbreeds with woman, a flying disc (genereically known as UFO), the Star of David (the possible explanation of Wayne Herschel is that the Star of David means, as in Heavens so on Earth. And refers to the Reptilian arrival on Earth.), the Orion’s belt and many other figures.



You can see Credo Mutawa bellow, with a reptilian depiction (as he sees them) and the inherited necklace:

After Icke’s interviews, Credo Mutawa was tortured and the necklace stolen. Behind the criminals was a white man that Credo never saw before.

This wonderful person also tells the already well known story (from all other civilizations), that the African people didn’t had the right to depict the Reptilians in their reptilian shape. Those who broke this rule were killed by the reptilians.

Again, ALL civilizations have almost the same story. How could thousands of miles apart civilizations have the same stories of our creation and the reptilian gods?



GOLD MINING – HOW LONG AGO? 

Is there evidence that mining took place, in southern Africa, during the Old Stone Age? Archaeological studies indicate that it indeed was so. 



Realizing that sites of abandoned ancient mines may indicate where gold could be found, South Africa’s leading mining corporation, the Anglo-American Corporation, in the 1970s engaged archaeologists to look for such ancient mines. Published reports (Optima) detail the discovery in Swaziland and other sites in South Africa of extensive mining areas with shafts to depths of fifty feet. Stone objects and charcoal remains established dates of 35,000, 46,000, and 60,000 B.C. for these sites. The archaeologists and anthropologists who joined in dating the finds believed that mining technology was used in southern Africa “during much of the period subsequent to 100,000 B.C.” 



In September 1988, a team of international physicists came to South Africa to verify the age of human habitats in Swaziland and Zululand. The most modern techniques indicated an age of 80,000 to 115,000 years. 



Regarding the most ancient gold mines of Monotapa in southern Zimbabwe, Zulu legends hold that they were worked by “artificially produced flesh and blood slaves created by the First People.” These slaves, the Zulu legends recount, “went into battle with the Ape-Man” when “the great war star appeared in the sky”. (see Indaba My Children, by the Zulu medicine man Credo Vusamazulu Mutwa). [Genesis Revisited]



I find VERY interesting the following statements from Dan Eden’s article:

“It would seem that humans have always valued gold. It is even mentioned in the Bible, describing the Garden of Eden’s rivers:

Genesis 2:11 – The name of the first [river] is Pishon; it flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.”

AND

“Why would ancient people work so hard to mine gold? You can’t eat it. It’s too soft to use for tool making. It isn’t really useful for anything except ornaments and its physical beauty is on a par with other metals like copper or silver. Exactly why was gold so important to early homo sapiens?”

I’ve always wanted to write an article in which to explain why the humans always appreciated gold so much, but the article would have been too big and would have involved too much mind-blowing history lessons. But now, in this context, the answer is quite simple and hits the center of the bullseye: “The gold was always valuable to us, because the GODS considered it to be valuable! If they sacrificed so much to extract it, then it HAS to be precious!” This was the base concept that gave the gold so much value in our primitive minds, few hundred thousands years ago. The Anunnaki needed gold to heal their home planet’s atmosphere, we wanted gold because they considered it valuable.

I still hear pretty often today the expression: “Gold, the metal of the gods!”, but this was probably a very common thing to say back then. We can speculate that after the Anunnaki moved into their underground cities, the humans begun using gold as the supreme currency. 

 

But looking at our modern history, gold still plays a very important role in the elite’s plans.

First of all, the bankers changed the rule which stated that a country’s currency should be backed up by gold placed in the treasury. After this move, our money became worthless pieces of paper (or digits on a computer screen) and the bankers had clear access to the gold reserves without anyone to be able to keep them under surveillance.

You should really watch this before going further:



After 2:00 minute you will see how one of the greatest gold robberies in history was set up by the bankers in May 1, 1933!

But the crown of the greatest gold heist in history goes to World Trade Center.

$300 billion in gold bars (bullions) where stolen in 9/11/2001:

 To this we can add all the gold treasures took in possession after WWI and II. But where is this gold? Can we speculate that the Reptilians still send gold from Earth to their home planets?

If this is the case, then they have the ultimate schematic to do it. We extract it because it’s valuable to us as a jewelry, but we don’t consume it in any way. The same extracted quantities of gold are found in the world, but spread between individuals all around the planet, who wear them as jewelery. All they need to do is to collect it from us. After WWI, the Germans were asked to prove their patriotism by donating to the state all the gold they still had, so that the economy would be helped to recover. And they did it! Then, in WWII, Hitler confiscated all the gold that the Jews possessed and all the gold reserves of all the concurred countries. The spoils of war were divided between the US, UK and Russia. After the self inflicted would of 9/11, the US army confiscated Saddam’s gold.

 So, in the end, the entire gold of the planet is eventually cumulated in one place. But where dose it go from there?

 ED SCHULTZ, HOST: Good evening, Americans. And welcome to THE ED 

SHOW from New York.

 

 Americans have had enough of this division II Republican presidential 

side show. Today, the all-stars took to the court and scored big for the 

middle class. I have got a chart for you tonight you will easily 

understand -- if you`re a low-information voter.

 

 This is THE ED SHOW -- let`s get to work.

 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

 

 JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you give any 

one of these guys the keys to the White House, they will bankrupt the 

middle class again.

 

 SCHULTZ (voice-over): It is day one of the blue collar campaign tour 

and the Obama/Biden ticket is hitting the Republicans hard.

 

 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If some of these folks 

were around when Columbus set sail, they would not have believed the world 

was round.

 

 SCHULTZ: We`re going to the heartland to see how the president and 

his running mate did.

 

 OBAMA: Let`s get to work.

 

 SCHULTZ: And the new Obama documentary is finally out. We`ll have a 

first look.

 

 TOM HANKS, NARRATOR: The tough decisions that he would make would not 

only determine the course of the nation, they reveal the character of the 

man.

 

 SCHULTZ: Mitt Romney is flip-flopping on this remark.

 

 MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Planned Parenthood, going to 

get rid of that.

 

 SCHULTZ: And the governor of Pennsylvania is advising women how to 

get through their state-mandated ultrasound. 

 

 GOV. TOM CORBETT (R), PENNSYLVANIA: Not make anybody watch, you just 

have to close your eyes.

 

 SCHULTZ: ""Salon`s"" Joan Walsh is here with the latest.

 

 And talk about a game change, Ann Coulter is throwing the mama grizzly 

under the bus.

 

 ANN COULTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: The conservative movement does 

have more of a problem with con men and charlatans.

 

 SCHULTZ: MSNBC`s Martin Bashir is here with reaction.

 

 (END VIDEOTAPE)

 

 SCHULTZ: Good to have you with us tonight, folks. Thanks for 

watching.

 

 Today was the kickoff of Obama/Biden 2012 campaign. Vice President 

Joe Biden made the campaign`s first official reelection appearance at a 

union hall in Toledo, Ohio. And the UAW guys just ate it up.

 

 About 600 miles away, the president of the United States spoke to a 

community college in Maryland. He addressed the hot-button issue of higher 

gas prices and he called out the Republicans for their fear-mongering 

tactics.

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 OBAMA: Gas prices went up around this time last year. Gas prices 

shot up in the spring and summer of 2008, I remember, I was running for 

president at the time. This has been going on for years now. And every 

time prices start to go up, especially in an election year, politicians 

dust off their three-point plans for $2 gas. I guess this year they 

decided they were going to make it $2.50.

 

 I don`t know where -- you know, why not $2.40? Why not $2.10? But 

they -- but they tell the same story, they head down to the gas station, 

they make sure a few cameras are following them, and then they start acting 

like we`ve got a magic wand and we will give you cheap gas forever if you 

just elect us -- every time, been the same script for 30 years. It`s like 

a bad rerun.

 

 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: The president repeated what we already know. 

 

 Now, this is a fact, and I know that the Republicans have a hard time 

with facts: the United States of America is producing more oil today than 

it has in the last eight years. He also repeated his call for an end to 

oil subsidies, which, of course, Republicans don`t like, and, of course, 

talked about developing alternative energy sources, which, of course, they 

think is a cop-out.

 

 President Obama didn`t waste time pointing out how Republicans have 

rejected all of these ideas.

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 OBAMA: Here`s the sad thing. Lately, we`ve heard a lot of 

professional politicians, a lot of the folks who are, you know, running for 

a certain office -- who shall go unnamed. They`ve been talking down new 

sources of energy. They dismiss wind power. They dismiss solar power. 

They make jokes about biofuels.

 

 They were against raising fuel standards. I guess they like gas 

guzzlers. They think that`s good for our future.

 

 We`re trying to move towards the future. They want to be stuck in the 

past. We`ve heard this kind of thinking before.

 

 Let me tell you something: if some of these folks were around when 

Columbus set sail, they must have been founding members of the Flat Earth 

Society, they would not have believed that the world was round. 

 

 (APPLAUSE)

 

 (END VIDEOTAPE)

 

 SCHULTZ: That`s telling it like it is. Republicans, you know what, 

they still don`t get it. Flat Earth or Mitt Romney was singing the same 

old tune on FOX News today. He said President Obama should be blamed for 

the high gas prices?

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you hold President Obama responsible?

 

 ROMNEY: Absolutely. He has not pursued policies that convince the 

world that America is going to become energy secure, energy independent. 

The world believes that America`s not going to have the energy we need and 

we`re going to have to continue sending hundreds of billions of dollars out 

of our economy, going into other nations. 

 

 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: You know, I just wish somebody on the campaign trail 

somewhere would shout out, you know, is it true the United States is 

producing more oil today than it has in the last eight years? That`s a 

fact. I mean, that is an absolute fact.

 

 Why don`t they ever have to answer those questions? This is part of 

the latest right wing attack on the president. They say President Obama 

wants higher gas prices to force alternative spending when it comes to 

alternative energy. They want to spend more money on that.

 

 So, he thinks the president wants high gas prices so we can go in a 

different direction. The American people aren`t buying it in.

 

 In a FOX News poll, 50 percent said the president is unhappy with high 

gas prices because they hurt the American people. Only 31 percent believe 

the right wing talking point about the president being happy over rising 

gas prices.

 

 Now, while the president was making his case for a sensible energy 

policy, Vice President Joe Biden, he was simply on fire in Ohio. In fact, 

it looks like, you know, not to be grandiose here, but it looks like the 

Obama campaign is picking up on a lot of things we`ve been talking about on 

THE ED SHOW for a long time.

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 BIDEN: My dad taught us something a lot of you know, a job is about a 

lot more than a paycheck, it`s about your dignity, it`s about respect, it`s 

about your place in the community. It`s about being able to turn to your 

kids to say it`s going to be OK. That`s what a job`s about. 

 

 I don`t know if these other guys understand that, and folks, that`s 

how Barack and I measure economic success, whether the middle class is 

growing or not, that`s the message of success. 

 

 Of growing, vibrant middle class where moms and dads, mothers and 

fathers, can look at their kids and say, honey, it`s going to be OK.

 

 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: And I have said it so many times that if you stand with 

workers, you can`t lose. If you win the middle class, you will win this 

next election in 2012. 

 

 Vice president Biden drew a line in the sand between Democrats and 

Republicans when it comes to middle class values. 

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 BIDEN: Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, and Newt Gingrich -- these guys 

have a fundamentally different economic philosophy than we do. Our 

philosophy -- ours is one that values the workers and the success of a 

business. It values the middle class and the success of our economy.

 

 Simply stated: we`re about promoting the private sector. They are 

about protecting the privileged sector. We are for a fair shot and a fair 

shake. They are about no rules, no risks, and no accountability.

 

 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: It`s no mistake that Biden spoke in Toledo, Ohio, the Ohio 

city relies greatly on the automobile industry. There is no doubt the auto 

rescue will be a large part of the Obama reelection campaign.

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 BIDEN: Governor Romney was more direct -- let Detroit go bankrupt. 

He said that. He said that, he said that what we propose, and I quote, ""is 

even worse than bankruptcy,"" end of quote. He said it would make G.M., 

 quote, ""the living dead."" Newt Gingrich said, quote, ""a mistake."" 

But the guy I work with every day, the president, he didn`t flinch.

 

 That`s the kind of president, in my view, we all want -- a president 

with the courage of his convictions.

 

 A president willing to take risks on behalf of American workers and 

the American people, and, folks, that`s exactly what we have -- a president 

with the courage of his convictions. He made the tough call, and the 

verdict is in, President Obama was right, and they were dead wrong!

 

 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: Republicans were wrong about the automobile rescue, and if 

you live in Ohio or in Michigan, that really should be your benchmark as to 

who you choose in November. The Republicans were totally wrong about the 

automobile loan and saving American jobs and understanding what the 

trickle-down effect would have been. The president knew it and so did the 

Democrats.

 

 They were also wrong about economic policy for eight years before 

President Obama took office. Well, the Obama campaign released a 17-minute 

documentary today to remind everyone how bad it was when the president took 

office.

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 NARRATOR: What do we remember in November of 2008? Was it this 

moment? Or this?

 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an economy right now that can`t find the 

bottom of bad news.

 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ten years of saving, completely gone, banished, 

poof.

 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Watching the Dow Industrial Average has been like 

watching the heart monitor on a critically ill-patient.

 

 NARRATOR: How do we understand this president and his time in office? 

Do we look at the day`s headlines or do we remember what we, as a country, 

have been through?

 

 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: The timing of this documentary is absolutely perfect. There 

were more jobs added to the economy last month, more good news, and today`s 

report on jobless claims shows first-time requests for unemployment 

insurance has fallen to a four-year low.

 

 Now, Republicans, is that a good fact or is that a bad fact?

 

 People are starting to get it. In the first time since 2010, a FOX 

News poll found more people saying the Obama administration made the 

economy better than made it worse. In that same poll, 58 percent say that 

they see signs of the economy turning around.

 

 You know, I`m so glad that we are talking about the campaign. I have 

a suggestion for the Democrats tonight -- don`t campaign unless you have 

this chart with you on the road. Don`t campaign unless you go to these 

town hall meetings and put this up and hand this out to the people that you 

are talking to.

 

 Now, this is, of course, the vulture chart. That`s Rick Santorum and 

Mitt Romney up there. I don`t have room for Newt. He doesn`t score very 

well.

 

 The red line, over the last 30 years, this is where the top 2 percent 

has gone in America when it comes to income. Who`s gotten all the breaks, 

who`s gotten all the tax cuts, who`s gotten all the deregulation? Look 

where the top 2 percent has gone, the vulture chart.

 

 Now, you folks down in Alabama and Mississippi, I hear so much about 

Alabama and Mississippi, how the Democrats can`t win there. I got news for 

you, this chart plays everywhere.

 

 The blue line is where the middle class is in this country, where your 

income has gone. This vulture chart plays everywhere, and the Democrats 

should make this chart the focal point of every speech they give on the 

road. Why? Because the Republicans can`t deny it. The Republicans have 

no game for this. In fact, Mitt Romney`s tax plan plays right into this 

chart. 

 

 Let me look at the tax plan for Mitt Romney. If you make under 

$30,000 a year under the Romney tax plan, your taxes are going to be going 

up. That`s right. If you`re on the left there, in the blue, your taxes 

are going to be going up if you`re in that income category.

 

 Now, if you make over $1 million a year, anywhere from $500,000 to 

over $1 million a year, you`re going to get a tax cut between 2 percent and 

5 percent. Let`s go back to the vulture chart.

 

 So, the Republican plan, they have more for the red liners, they have 

nothing but more taxes for the blue liners. Median income in Alabama, 

$40,976. Median income in Mississippi, $37,881.

 

 If you live in Mississippi and you live in Alabama, your taxes, if 

Mitt Romney is the next president -- your taxes in that income bracket, 

they are going up.

 

 Look, I`m just tired of hearing about how the Democrats can`t win the 

South. That chart plays in every single Southern state. This is what they 

want: more tax cuts for the rich. This is what they want: more hardship on 

the blue liners across America.

 

 You tell me, why do you think the Republicans are going after these 

social issues, because they have no answer for this chart. It is an 

undeniable piece of economic information that the Democrats need to hammer 

on every stop. It`s a fact.

 

 Low-information voters, come on, you can grab that. If you`re making 

under $30,000 a year, your taxes are going up if the Republicans get 

elected, it`s that simple.

 

 Get your cell phones out, I want to know what you think. Tonight`s 

question: who will be better for the economy, President Obama or the GOP? 

Text A for the president, text B for the GOP to 232669. We can always go 

to our blog at Ed.MSNBC.com. We, of course, want to know what you think. 

 

 And I want to know what American workers think about the Obama/Biden 

campaign kickoff today. I`ll talk with a former Ohio teacher and one who 

is running for president -- running for representative position in Ohio. I 

want to know what she thought of the president`s speech today in Ohio and 

Congressman Tim Ryan will also joins us.

 

 And later, the Republican war on women continues. I`ll talk to the 

president of Emily`s List about the GOP`s opposition of Violence Against 

Women Act.

 

 Stay tuned. We`ll be right back.

 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)

 

 SCHULTZ: Coming up, Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan and teacher Maureen 

Reedy join me with the reaction of the president and the vice president`s 

speeches today. Mitt Romney flip-flops on his Planned Parenthood comments, 

Joan Walsh of Salon.com on the GOP three-ring circus.

 

 Share your thoughts on Twitter using the #EdShow. We`re right back.

 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 OBAMA: We`re going to combine our creativity and our optimism, our 

brain power, our manpower, our woman power, tell them -- yes, we can. Tell 

them, we are going to build an economy that will last. Tell them we`re 

going to make this an American century just like the last century. 

 

 Thank you, Prince George`s County. Thank you, Prince George`s 

Community College. Thank you, Maryland. Let`s get to work.

 

 God bless you. God bless America.

 

 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: Yes, let`s get to work.

 

 President Obama`s major strategy as he kicked off his reelection 

campaign today was to point out how his policies have made a difference in 

the lives of a lot of Americans.

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 OBAMA: Passed a payroll tax at the beginning of this year to make 

sure everybody had an extra $40 in their paycheck on average. In part, 

because we anticipated that gas prices might be going up like they did last 

year -- given tight world oil supplies.

 

 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: Vice President Joe Biden was also making the connection 

between the administration`s energy policies and the money these policies 

have helped save.

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 BIDEN: The president`s historic fuel economy efficiency standards 

that nearly double the efficiency of cars, saving the American families 

$1.7 trillion at the pump, helping free us from foreign oil dependence.

 

 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: This is the incumbent advantage. Republicans spent the last 

three years saying no, instead of passing legislation. They have very few 

accomplishments to run on.

 

 So, congressional Republicans are feeling the heat. Today, Republican 

Rick Crawford of Arkansas -- listen to this -- he unveiled a proposal to 

reintroduce a balance budget amendment, but it will include a tax on any 

income over $1 million. 

 

 News flash coming up: this guy`s going to get thrown out of the party 

and the caucus, you wait. This is a major shift away from the Republican 

pledge of no new taxes.

 

 But the fact is, there`s one Republican over there that says, wait a 

minute, we have to do something about the Treasury, the red line that Ed`s 

talking about is right.

 

 That`s basically why he`s doing this. He knows the top 2 percent 

needs to pay more.

 

 Let`s turn to Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio, and, Maureen 

Reedy, she is an Ohio teacher and was the teacher of the year in 2002 in 

the state of Ohio and is now running for a seat in the Ohio House of 

Representatives. I love the story.

 

 Congressman, you first. Great to have you with us tonight. 

 

 Is this going to connect with Ohio voters? How much of an impact do 

you think Vice President Biden had today?

 

 REP. TIM RYAN (D), OHIO: Well, it`s huge. It just reminds everybody 

of how huge the auto rescue package was. It reminds everybody where we 

were and where we are now when one of every eight jobs in the state of Ohio 

is related to the auto industry, the supply chain, the local tax base, huge 

cuts all across the state.

 

 Can you imagine what communities would be like if they didn`t have the 

auto workers and their supply chains paying taxes in Ohio? And Biden 

reminds everybody of that.

 

 SCHULTZ: And, Tim, what do you think of the guy across the aisle, 

Rick Crawford. He says that the wealthy got to pay more. Are the 

Republicans changing their policies a little bit?

 

 RYAN: Well, I think he`s a dead man walking in a Republican primary 

is what I think. They just can`t get away with that over there. You know, 

I have Republican friends here in Ohio who say, hey, why wouldn`t you tax 

somebody that`s making more than $1 million? We have this huge budget 

deficit we need to deal with.

 

 So, I think some moderate Republicans are like that. But for the most 

part, the Tea Party, I doubt highly, will let him get away with that. He`s 

going to get primaried, whether it`s now or in two years, and he`s going to 

be back in the private sector, if I had to guess.

 

 SCHULTZ: Maureen, I want to play -- 

 

 RYAN: And it`s a shame, Ed. It`s a shame.

 

 SCHULTZ: It is a shame, because it`s the right thing to do. It 

doesn`t affect 99 percent of the people out there in America, and we`ve got 

to fix the Treasury. He has the guts to stand up and do something about 

it, but I think you got it right. They are going to primary the guy.

 

 I want to play a clip from Vice President Joe Biden, who was speaking 

in your state today, Maureen. Here it is.

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 BIDEN: It`s not just the automobile industries coming back, folks. 

Manufacturing`s coming back. The middle class is coming back. America is 

coming back -- workers, worker by worker, home by home, community by 

community, this country is coming back!

 

 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: Maureen, does this message speak to you?

 

 MAUREEN REEDY, OHIO SCHOOL TEACHER: It sure does, Ed. You know, what 

vice president Biden was saying is that our president doesn`t give up on 

hard-working people in America, just as teachers and parents, we don`t give 

up on our children.

 

 And, you know, President Obama didn`t lock the door and throw away the 

keys on the auto industry. Instead, he found a way to drive us through the 

downturn by investing in policies that really strengthened the middle 

class. 

 

 SCHULTZ: Have you seen a change in the thinking of the people of Ohio 

ever since the anti-union bill was knocked down? I mean, do you see a 

sense of confidence among Ohioans right now that it`s going to be tough for 

the Republicans to win that state?

 

 REEDY: You know, Ed, I think what Ohioans found in this past year is 

that we`re a collective voice and we`re claiming equal representation for 

Ohioans from all walks of life. You know, we have a right to 

representation for equal opportunity, for investment and education, for 

investment in our local communities.

 

 Right now our state has shifted the cost of balancing the budget to 

our local communities, and I`ve been knocking on hundreds of doors, and 

people are worried about the stability and balance in their communities.

 

 SCHULTZ: Now, you`re a teacher and have been for a number of years 

and was teacher of the year in 2002 in Ohio. I understand that not only 

you, but a number of your friends, have had enough. 

 

 How many of you are running for representative positions in the state 

of Ohio? I love this story.

 

 REEDY: Well, Ed, I`ve given it a nickname. We`ve given it a 

nickname, 10 teachers to the state house. It`s unprecedented. Ten 

teachers are leaving their classroom and their careers and going from 

protesting outside the doors of the state house to getting to work inside 

the state house.

 

 SCHULTZ: That`s great.

 

 Finally, Congressman, a big focal point of the Obama reelection 

campaign is going to be on the automobile industry and, of course, the loan 

and how it worked. Is that going to be enough in Ohio?

 

 RYAN: Well, it`s not just that, Ed. I think that`s the center piece, 

but he also slapped tariffs on Chinese steel tubing that was coming in to 

the state. They were dumping it here. He slapped a big tariff on them, 

slapped big tariff on Chinese tires getting dumped in. Those are huge for 

Ohio. Plus, the supply chain and auto industry.

 

 And then he`s making investments in education, you know. The reduced 

interest rate for student loans, the investments in the Pell grants, the 

investments in the community colleges, that`s how you build a future in 

Ohio -- a great manufacturing state, and he`s been able to do it.

 

 SCHULTZ: And doesn`t Joe Biden look good in union hall? It`s like he 

sleeps there, he seems so at home. 

 

 RYAN: Yes, I think he`s been there once or twice.

 

 SCHULTZ: Congressman Tim Ryan and Maureen Reedy, teacher in Ohio -- 

good luck to you, we`ll visit again. Thanks so much. 

 

 Next up, Romney attacks women`s health care. Santorum says Puerto 

Ricans, well, they better speak English. And Gingrich says that we`re all 

stupid. Joan Walsh has got all of that next, coming up.

 

 Later, the University of Southern Mississippi apologizing to a Kansas 

State player after racist remarks were yelled at him during the NCAA 

tournament today. Details ahead.

 

 Stay with us.

 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)

 



 SCHULTZ: Welcome back to THE ED SHOW. Mitt Romney, I mean, he just 

can`t get his act together. And he has flip-flopped, yes, once again. 

Here`s what he said Tuesday about Planned Parenthood. 



 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Of course you get rid of 

Obamacare. That`s the easy one. But there are others. Planned 

Parenthood, we`re going to get rid of that. 



 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: Just so easy. He caught a lot of flak for that comment. So 

24 hours later, he tried to walk it back, telling the ""Chicago Sun Times"" 

that he did not want to close Planned Parenthood. ""He said Planned 

Parenthood is a private organization. What I want to do is get rid of the 

federal funding of Planned Parenthood."" 

 

 It`s a Romney classic, no doubt about it. Trying to appeal to a 

conservative base, but then softening it up after getting some blow back. 

But Planned Parenthood gets major funding from the federal government, and 

it provides preventive health care to three million women every year. 

 

 This is what Romney says he would cut. And it`s a matter of -- it`s 

just going to hurt a lot of low-income women across this country. Why -- 

why do they have a propensity to just pick on the poor? 

 

 On a lighter note, Romney`s campaign is sick and tired of getting 

criticized for strapping the family dog on the roof of the car. Well, a 

Romney adviser said ""for crying out loud, with 8.3 percent unemployment, if 

the dog defeats you, you deserve to get defeated. Come on. You`ve got to 

run a good campaign to overcome that. President Obama overcame Reverend 

Wright and Billy Ayers.""

 

 So Seamus the dog is now being compared to Jeremiah Wright and Billy 

Ayers. Very, very strange. Joining me now is Joan Walsh, editor at large, 

Salon.com. 

 

 Joan, great to have you with us tonight. 



 JOAN WALSH, SALON.COM: Thanks, Ed. 



 SCHULTZ: Let`s begin with Mitt Romney and the Planned Parenthood. 

Does he think that he`s going to win against the Democrats and President 

Obama doing it this way? 



 WALSH: I don`t know what he thinks. You know, I think he thought, 

Ed, that he was able to fire Planned Parenthood. He likes to be able to 

fire people. And so he said that and then his staff said oh, governor, you 

really can`t get rid of Planned Parenthood. You can`t fire them. So then 

he had to walk it back. 

 

 but it`s so preposterous. And as you said, I mean, Planned Parenthood 

does so much. They do breast cancer screenings. They do a full women`s 

health screening. And they also -- let`s really be honest, they prevent 

abortions. I mean, we really would be looking at an increased abortion 

rate if Planned Parenthood were to go away.

 

 So, you know, there`s so many ways to hit Romney on this. And he`s 

going to be hit on it hard no matter how many times he walks back his 

stupid remarks. 



 SCHULTZ: Here`s Romney again today. Let`s play it. 



 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 ROMNEY: Look, we`re not going to go to a brokered convention. 



 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`re not? 



 ROMNEY: One or the other of us, among the three or four that are 

running, is going to get the delegates necessary to become the nominee. As 

it gets closer toward the end, it`s going to be clear we have got someone 

who is in the strong lead. States that remain will vote for that person. 

And that person will get the delegates and become the nominee. 



 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: I mean, that person? Why doesn`t he say I`m going to get 

enough and we`re going to get it done? He doesn`t have much confidence 

there, does he? 



 WALSH: No, he doesn`t sound like he has much confidence. I have been 

on vacation for a week, Ed. I went away after Super Tuesday, and I came 

back and it`s like Groundhog Day. Rick Santorum wins more states; Mitt 

Romney wins more delegates; Newt Gingrich won`t go away.

 

 And Romney`s insisting there won`t be a brokered convention. There 

doesn`t have to be a smoke-filled room, secret deal kind of brokered 

convention. But it really may be very hard for him to get to 1,144 the 

normal way. So he`s looking at a world of pain the -- the longer this goes 

on. 

 

 It`s great he`s making light of it, but there`s nothing to make light 

of. 



 SCHULTZ: Rick Santorum has his own problems. He told Puerto Rico 

that they better make English the principle language if they want to become 

a state. And 23 percent of moderate or liberal Republicans would vote for 

President Obama over Santorum. Twenty percent of Romney supporters say 

that they would vote for President Obama over Santorum.

 

 What do you make of that? 



 WALSH: Santorum is unelectable as president, you know. Look, all of 

them. They want to insult women. They want to insult Latinos. I don`t -- 

sometimes, Ed, this is just such good news for the White House I think I`m 

missing something. 

 

 There must be a secret playbook where it actually helps you to 

alienate the fastest-growing segment of the electorate, Latinos, to 

alienate the base -- the majority of the voters, women. They just -- day 

after day, they alienate key segments of the electorate and say they are 

going to win. They are not going to win. 



 SCHULTZ: I got another good one for you. Here`s Newt Gingrich today. 



 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 NEWT GINGRICH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The thing I find most 

disheartening about this campaign is the difficulty of talking about 

positive ideas on a large scale, because the news media can`t cover it and, 

candidly, my opponents can`t comprehend it.

 

 And the result is you can`t have a serious conversation. We are at 

the edge of such extraordinary opportunities. And it is so hard to get 

this party to understand it. 

 

 Our political system is so methodically and deliberately stupid, and I 

use that word deliberately. 



 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: So Newt`s losing because people are stupid. There`s a good 

one for you. 



 WALSH: That is a good one. That`s really going to endear him with 

swing voters, that he`s the smartest guy in the room and that he`s too 

smart and we can`t understand him. You know, what an elitist. They call 

President Obama an elitist. He`s never said anything that stupid, quite 

honestly. 



 SCHULTZ: Well, Newt Gingrich is just an unguided missile on the 

campaign tour right now. Joan Walsh, thank you for joining us tonight. 

Always a pleasure to have you here with us. 



 WALSH: Thank you. 



 SCHULTZ: The war on women heads to Pennsylvania. Governor Corbett is 

giving advice to women undergoing state mandated ultrasounds. 



 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 GOV. TOM CORBETT (R), PENNSYLVANIA: I`m not making anybody watch, OK? 

You just have to close your eyes. 



 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: We`ll have the latest with Stephanie Schriock of Emily`s 

List. 



 It was truly March Madness at the NCAA tournament today. Racist 

chants from the crowd at a Puerto Rican player were caught on tape.

 

 And Ann Coulter getting is honest and throwing the mama grizzly under 

the bus. 



 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 ANN COULTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: The conservative movement does 

have more of a problem with con men and charlatans than the Democratic 

party. 



 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: MSNBC`s Martin Bashir on Coulter`s moment of clarity.

 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)

 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), CALIFORNIA: I hope that this bill is not 

part of a march. And that march, as I see it over the past 20 years, has 

been to cut back on rights and services to women. 



 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: Republicans` war on women continues as their tone deafness 

reaches utterly appalling levels. The latest battle, the Violence Against 

Women Act. The legislation strengthens laws protecting women against 

domestic violence and sexual assault. 

 

 Since its original passing in 1994, domestic violence has dropped 58 

percent. Historically, the law has received broad bipartisan support. It 

is now up for reauthorization. And guess what, the Republicans are 

fighting it.

 

 Conservatives oppose the law because of a few updates. The law now 

gives Native American tribes authority to prosecute crimes. It also 

protects undocumented immigrants and same-sex couples from domestic 

violence. The party that gave America the Blunt Amendment now says it has 

more important things to focus on. 

 

 Senator John Thune of South Dakota telling ""the New York Times,"" 

""there are lots of other issues right now that could be dealt with other 

than this one."" 

 

 Really? What about the reservations on South Dakota territory there, 

senator? One Republican fighting the right wingers on this one is Senator 

Lisa Murkowski. Murkowski voted for the Blunt Amendment, went back to 

Alaska and, according to the ""Anchorage Daily News,"" got absolutely all 

kinds of hell from female voters. 

 

 She had this quote, ""I have never had a vote I have taken where I have 

felt that I let down more people that believed in me."" 

 

 Now Murkowski is reading members of her caucus and her party the Riot 

Act. The ""New York Times"" reports that Murkowski sternly warned her 

colleagues that the party was at risk of being successfully painted as 

anti-women at a closed-door meeting. 

 

 I`m joined tonight by Stephanie Schriock. She is the president of 

Emily`s List. Stephanie, great to have you with us tonight. 



 STEPHANIE SCHRIOCK, EMILY`S LIST: Thank you for having me. 



 SCHULTZ: You bet. 



 Is Murkowski`s warning to the Republicans too little too late? Can 

they turn this around? They are really starting to have an image problem. 



 SCHRIOCK: Well, I got to tell you, here they go again with this next 

piece on the preventing the domestic violence piece. It is one thing after 

another. And it is clear that this war on women that the Republican party 

is waging is back firing.

 

 And Emily`s List just did a poll recently and it showed in 

battleground states that voters overwhelmingly support women`s access to 

health care and birth control. They are wrong on this issue. And they 

just continue waging this war. 



 SCHULTZ: So how can Republicans oppose the Violence Against Women Act 

and survive as a party? I mean, they are absolutely alienating women 

voters, some of them who are not politically active or engaged. 



 SCHRIOCK: Women are just getting energized more and more. In the 

last year, since the Republicans took over the House of Representatives, 

Emily`s List, an organization committed to electing Democratic women, has 

doubled in size. We`re over a million members. 

 

 We are hearing from women all across the country that this has got to 

stop. We have got to change this path. 



 SCHULTZ: A measure in Pennsylvania -- I want to focus on Pennsylvania 

for a moment. A measure in that state would force women considering an 

abortion to receive copies of their ultrasound. Here`s what the Republican 

Governor Corbett had to say. 



 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Making them watch and -- does that go too far in 

your mind? 



 CORBETT: I`m not making anybody watch, OK, because you just have to 

close your eyes. 



 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: The people of Pennsylvania are against this. Why is the 

governor defending it? What do you think? 



 SCHRIOCK: Well, I got to say that any governor who has to say to his 

citizens, just close your eyes at the law that I just signed, boy, you 

better rethink signing that into law. This is exactly what we have to 

stop. And the way we do it is to make sure every woman in this country -- 

and they know that they`ve got to stand up for themselves.

 

 They have to go and vote this November. And we really, truly, need to 

elect more women. We have to get more women into this discussion. 



 SCHULTZ: You think this is going to get more women engaged 

politically, where they are going to want to run to office because of this? 

I`ll take you to another one. The state of Arizona wants to force women to 

provide proof to the employer that they are taking birth control for other 

reasons than just preventing pregnancy. Your thoughts? 



 SCHRIOCK: This is absolutely energizing women to step up and run for 

office. Emily`s List has more women running for the United States Senate 

than in the history of our nation. It is historic. We have women stepping 

up every day still across the country to run for the House. 

 

 Even the Ohio teacher you were just talking to, teachers stepping up 

in Ohio, running for the legislature. I mean, most of those teachers, they 

are going to be women. This is -- these folks are riled up. And it`s for 

all of us to stand up and work with these women who are standing up to run, 

so they can win this November. 



 SCHULTZ: Stephanie Schriock, great to have you with us on THE ED SHOW 

tonight. Thank you. 



 SCHRIOCK: Absolutely. Thank you.

 

 SCHULTZ: Next, racism rears its ugly head at the NCAA tournament. 

Today, hecklers yell insensitive remarks to a Hispanic player. We`ll tell 

you how that all played out next.

 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)

 

 SCHULTZ: Today, the Mississippi House of Representatives passed 

legislation similar to Arizona`s Show Me Your Papers Law targeting 

Hispanics. It is expected to pass the state Senate and be signed by 

Mississippi`s Republican Governor Phil Bryant. 

 

 Also today, the University of Southern Mississippi played Kansas State 

University in the first round of the NCAA tournament. What do these two 

events have to do with one another? 

 

 When Kansas State Freshman Angel Rodriguez approached the free-throw 

line at the end of the first half, here`s what he heard being shouted from 

the stands. 



 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As you see mills trying to come over and draw the 

charge, Rodriguez has already let the ball go. 

 

 He`s a freshman, but he`s about as cool as they come right now. No 

facial expression whatsoever.



 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: Members of the Southern Mississippi School band were 

shouting ""where`s your green card?"" Imagine just for a moment, you`re a 

college freshman -- college freshman starting, like Angel Rodriguez. You 

and your team make it to the NCAA tournament. I mean, it is the big dance, 

the big show. It is a dream come true.

 

 And while you`re out there on your court making your school proud, 

having a highlight in your life, you hear a bunch of bullies from the other 

school shouting ""where`s your green card."" By the way, Angel Rodriguez was 

born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 

 

 So here`s a quick geography lesson for Southern Mississippi students, 

Puerto Rico is part of the United States. People born in Puerto Rico are 

American citizens. 

 

 Well, the university president, Martha Saunders (ph), issued a 

statement apologizing for the remarks. Unfortunately, the president of the 

school, Saunders, failed to spell Mr. Rodriguez`s name correctly. 

 

 By the way, Kansas State won the game. One of the players who helped 

the Wildcats ice the game in the last minutes was the guard, Angel 

Rodriguez. 



 Next, Ann Coulter has a rare moment of truth. Plus, she wants to keep 

failed Republican presidential candidates away from Fox News? Hey, that`s 

my territory. 

 

 Martin Bashir with me next with a lot of fun. Stay with us.

 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)

 

 SCHULTZ: THE ED SHOW survey tonight, I asked who will be better for 

the economy, the president -- 98 percent of you say President Obama; two 

percent of you say the GOP. 



 Coming up, Ann Coulter takes on her party`s con men and charlatans. 

Who is she talking about? I`ll ask Martin Bashir next.

 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)

 

 SCHULTZ: And in the Big Finish tonight, the intelligentsia of the 

Republican party is battling it out over the presidential nomination. And 

for once, right-wing hate merchant Ann Coulter -- well, she is telling the 

truth. The Romney supporter unleashed on Sarah Palin and others in the 

Republican part at a speech in Florida. 

 

 The video is courtesy of SharkTank.net. 



 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 COULTER: One of the ones most heavily promoted now is Sarah Palin, 

who has suggested herself as -- as the choice. I think our party, and 

particularly our movement, the conservative movement, does have more of a 

problem with con men and charlatans than the Democratic party. 

 

 The incentives seem to be set up to allow people to -- you know, as 

long as you have a band of a few million fanatical followers, you can make 

money. 



 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: Well, Ann Coulter is the expert on making money by conning a 

few million fanatical followers, don`t you think? But she has an idea for 

getting rid of the charlatans in her party. 



 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 COULTER: All Republican nominees for president, I want them to sign a 

pledge saying if I lose the nomination, I pledge I will not take a gig with 

Fox News or write a book. 



 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: I think Coulter is worried about other right wingers 

stepping on her turf. Plugging books on Fox really is her specialty. 



 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 

 BILL O`REILLY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Ms. Coulter, the author of the new 

book, ""If Democrats Had Any Brains, They`d Be Republicans.""

 HANNITY: It`s called ""Demonic.""

 

 (END VIDEO CLIP)

 

 SCHULTZ: There`s just only so much room over there. Joining me now 

is MSNBC host Martin Bashir. We got a turf war going on here, don`t we? 



 MARTIN BASHIR, MSNBC ANCHOR: In all seriousness, Ed, this is a race 

for the most important office in the free world. And these individuals 

have reduced it to something akin to a Mr. Universe contest for men with 

learning difficulties. 

 

 Cast your mind back a year. Herman Cain -- what is Herman Cain`s 

resume have on it? Two things, he can make pizza and he has -- and it`s 

littered with allegations of sexual harassment towards women. 

 

 Or how about Rick Perry? Rick Perry, the man whose knowledge of the 

world is only matched by Sarah Palin, who in the film ""Game Change,"" we saw 

at the weekend, where she was shown a map of Europe and explained in simple 

terms, this is Germany and it sits at the heart of the continent of Europe, 

and that country was responsible for the Second World War, and that her 

majesty the queen is not the head of the British government. 

 

 Ann Coulter is absolutely right in her withering criticism of these 

individuals. 



 SCHULTZ: She complains about charlatans but supports Mitt Romney. 



 BASHIR: What choice does she have? She can either go back to the 

13th century with Rick Santorum or she can enter the world of King Newt 

Gingrich, where every week the nation would have to bow down and listen to 

some ludicrous idea from this man`s gargantuan ego.

 

 And by the way, if he ever became president, lock up your daughters 

and don`t let your wife speak to him. Or she wants to go with Mitt Romney. 

Who is Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney is whoever you want him to be. There`s 

not much of an option for Ann Coulter. 



 SCHULTZ: So how bad have things gotten with the Republicans that Ann 

Coulter is now the rational thinker on the block? 



 BASHIR: I think that she`s absolutely right in her analysis. These 

individuals are not running for the nation. They are running for the self. 

Ron Paul is running for the future of his son. Newt Gingrich is running 

with Callista to sell children`s books about an elephant. 

 

 Mitt Romney is a 65 year old man with so much personal wealth that 

he`ll never spend it for the rest of his life. He has nothing else to do. 

You`re never gripped by the idea of a vision for the country, of someone 

coming up with a narrative that grips the people.

 

 None of these individuals have that. And she makes the point, they 

are running for themselves. 



 SCHULTZ: And she also -- besides Palin, is she including her 

description -- who is she including in her description of con men and 

charlatans? 



 BASHIR: I guess she must be including someone like Mike Huckabee, who 

when he was running for president, didn`t win the nomination, as we know, 

and now has such a lucrative broadcasting career, started at Fox -- now 

he`ll be opening on a radio station, as you know. And you know radio 

better than anyone else.

 

 When the Republicans come to Mike Huckabee and say to him, would you 

please run for the presidency, he says no way; I have a much more lucrative 

career doing what I`m doing. So I guess she must have him in mind. 



 SCHULTZ: The show continues.

 

 BASHIR: The show continues.

 

 SCHULTZ: Martin Bashir, always a pleasure. 



 BASHIR: Great to be with you. 



 SCHULTZ: That`s THE ED SHOW, I`m Ed Schultz. You can listen to me 

on Sirius XM radio, Channel 127, Monday through Friday, noon to 3:00 PM. 

You can follow me on Twitter @EdShow. And you can like THE ED SHOW on 

Facebook. 

 

 ""THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW"" starts right now. Good evening, Rachel. 



 RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC ANCHOR: Good evening, Ed. I`m very excited, Ed. 

Tonight is the night of my big interview with James Inhofe of Oklahoma that 

I was talking to you about the other day. 



 SCHULTZ: A Republican is coming on your program? I can`t score any 

Republicans, but not that I want to. But I am going to watch Jim Inhofe. 



 MADDOW: I desperately want to. If you were wondering what the 

fireworks were about in the hallway, it`s us celebrating that we got a 

Republican to come in here. Really looking forward to it. 



 SCHULTZ: No doubt. You can ask him why he landed on the wrong 

runway. But that`s another story.

743,"Could 2,000 years of belief be wrong? Are we in fact living on a disc rather than a globe? One believer from the Flat Earth Society is determined to find out. “Mad” Mike Hughes is all set to build his own rocket to see for himself that the Earth is flat.

For the last 50 years, we’ve been able to view pictures of the Earth from space, which might seem like all the proof you need to see that our planet is in fact round. But the awareness of how easily images can be doctored and the growth of internet conspiracy theories appears to have fuelled a resurgence of belief in a flat Earth.

At the same time, there’s a lack of understanding of the science that has long been used to demonstrate that we live on a globe, without the need to leave it. I wish Hughes well with his endeavour, as he has at least been willing to try and prove his theory. Perhaps if more people really could see for themselves the evidence, we might be able to reverse this worrying trend. A good place to start would be by making sure children have the chance to try out simple experiments in school.

One of the best documented methods for determining the Earth’s roundness was first performed (to our knowledge) by the ancient Greeks. This was achieved by comparing the shadows of sticks in different locations. When the sun was directly overhead in one place, the stick there cast no shadow. At the same time in a city around 500 miles north, the stick there did cast a shadow.

If the Earth were flat then both sticks should show the same shadow (or lack of) because they would be positioned at the same angle towards the sun. The ancient Greeks found the shadows were different because the Earth was curved and so the sticks were at different angles. They then used the difference in these angles to calculate the circumference of the Earth. They managed to get it to within 10% of the true value – not bad for around 250 BC.

Another piece of evidence for a globe is the difference between the night skies in the northern and southern hemispheres. The view is completely different because the Earth beneath you is pointing in a different direction. If the Earth were flat, the view should be the same. This can be made even easier by simply comparing when it is night and day in each country.

You can observe the planets as well. They all rotate, and watching over the course of a few days gives a clear picture they are spherical rather than flat. The chance that most of the planets are spherical but the Earth is flat seems very unlikely.

But when science experiments are performed incorrectly they can appear to give the opposite result. If they are shared through social media, these false ideas can be spread quickly with no one to point out their flaws. One common example is the Bedford Level experiment, a form of which was first carried out in 1838 and used to “prove” the Earth was flat for over 30 years before an explanation was found.

This experiment involved placing a marker at a set height at either end of a canal about six miles long. If the Earth is round, then one marker should appear lower than the other when viewed at the same time through a telescope because the furthest marker would have fallen away with the curvature of the Earth. But it was reported that the markers are the same height, suggesting the Earth is actually flat. Modern day Flat Earth theorists still quote this experiment.

The problem is this doesn’t take into account the optical effect of the air over the intervening water, which bends or “refracts” the light as it travels from the marker to the telescope and makes it look like they are the same height. The solution is to use multiple markers along the length of the canal which, when observed, all appear to be at different heights.

Perhaps the most impressive experiment that even schools can do today is to send a camera up in a high-altitude balloon. The footage will show that from a high-enough vantage point you can see the curvature of the Earth. This is what Mike Hughes will find if he ever makes his rocket work.

Ultimately, arguing on the internet is not the best way forward for any scientific endeavour. We need to provide the means for people to test these theories themselves and to understand the results they get.

Though each aspect of this subject is more than enough for an in depth article, there is often a need for more of an overall summary to pass on to those that are not aware of the broader picture.

What Major Factor Causing ""Climate Change"" Are They Not Telling Us About?



More alarming articles and studies are surfacing each day which confirm the rapidly changing state of Earth's life support systems and climate. Humanity has decimated the planet in countless ways and the repercussions are becoming catastrophic. Though there are certainly many parts to this unfolding story, the largest piece of the puzzle by far still goes completely unacknowledged by the entire scientific community and all of the main stream media / corporate / military / industrial complex. The massive elephant in the room has been, and still is, ""stratospheric aerosol geoengineering"" (SAG), AKA ""solar radiation management"" (SRM).

What Is Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering And Why Is It So Dangerous?



Stratospheric aerosol injection (AKA, geoengineering) is a primary term for the ongoing global climate modification programs being conducted by major powers around the world. ""Aerosols"" is simply a term for a microscopic particle that is suspended in the air. A primary stated goal of the geoengineering programs is to provide a ""solar shield"" to slow ""runaway climate change"" by spraying tens of millions of tons of highly toxic metal nano particulates (a nanometer is 1/1,000,000,000 of a meter) into the atmosphere (tens of millions of tons a year) from jet aircraft. Is the spraying only for solar radiation management? Based on available data, there are a number of known objectives including but not limited to solar radiation management (SRM), weather warfare, over the horizon radar enhancement, controlling food production, and probable biological testing. There are likely many more aspects and agendas related to the atmospheric spraying which we can not yet know.

Many Geoengineering Patents Have A Stated Goal Of Slowing Global Warming



Aluminum/alumina, among other toxic metals, is showing up in countless rain tests around the world. The amount of aluminum, barium, and other metals in these rain/snow tests is always high and often completely off the charts (even showing up in bees and whales). Snow tests from Mt Shasta in Northern California were toxic beyond belief. This area of the Pacific Northwest was thought to be a pristine water source. Dozens of rain samples taken in this region from numerous individuals were tested at the State certified lab in Northern California and showed shocking results without exception. Former US Forest Service Biologist Francis Mangles has confirmed the alarming heavy metal contamination with his own testing. Snow tests taken from the side of Mt. Shasta showed aluminum content as high as 61,000 PPB. (parts per billion). This level of aluminum in the snow is tens of thousands of times anything that might be considered ""normal background"" contamination. Levels this high can only be considered extremely toxic. Since these toxic metals are in the snow, they can only come from the air. Aluminum/alumina in ""free form"" does not naturally exist in the environment but is always bonded to other elements. So where is it coming from? Aluminum is the primary element named in numerous geoengineering patents. The same patents that describe dispersing this aluminum from jets for the expressed purpose of blocking the sun which is exactly what we see aircraft ""trails"" doing in our skies day in and day out, creating artificial cloud cover and haze which blocks direct sunlight. It is important to remember this contamination is not local, but global in scope. Movements have formed in countries all over the world which are desperately trying to address this dire issue.

Ozone layer damage is yet another known consequence of geoengineering the atmosphere (causing extremely dangerous UV radiation exposure). Other recent studies now note a ""shrinking atmosphere"" which is very possibly also linked to the ongoing geoengineering programs. The ""hydrological cycle"" of the planet is being completely disrupted by the geoengineering aerosol saturation of the atmosphere. How might such precipitation control benefit the power structure? Fungal proliferation is yet another inevitable crisis when the atmosphere is filled with particulates, soils are contaminated with the geoengineering fallout, and waters are polluted with the same. Already, countless species are feeling the effects. The current ""species extinction rate"" should be absolutely shocking to all. At the present time the ""extinction rate is 10,000 times ""natural variability"". This is 1,000,000% of ""normal background rates"". Though main stream media would never discuss this, we are currently in the sixth mass extinction on planet Earth. Is geoengineering responsible for all of this? Of course not all, but if the available science and data is considered, geoengineering is mathematically by far the single most significant cause of environmental and climate devastation on the planet today. If all available information is considered, geoengineering is the greatest and most immediate threat to all life on Earth short of nuclear catastrophe. Drought, deluge, and hazy toxic skies, welcome to geoengineering.

Though rain and snow is falling in areas of North America, at times in a deluge or ""blizzard"" depending on the season, the droughts in the continental US ( and many other regions around the globe), are getting worse overall. There are now often massive areas of drifting cloud cover spanning thousands of miles over land masses and oceans with little or no precipitation. Why is this? Why are the skies so often completely featureless as these expansive cloud banks and upper level ""haze"" drift across the globe? If individual clouds can be recognized in these ""drifting masses"", they often appear ""melted into"" the upper story of geoengineering ""haze"". Horizon to horizon geoengineering trails are not the only sign of spraying. Clouds should be ""white"" and the sky ""blue"". Wispy, dingy, cob web like upper level ""clouds"" are are not natural and are another hallmark of spraying, as are ""silvery white"" skies.

Atmospheric aerosol saturation greatly effects wind patterns and diminishes precipitation overall which in turn further fuels droughts of unprecedented scope and scale. The disruption in the hydrological cycle can also cause record rainfall as rain which was kept from falling in one location migrates elsewhere to come down in a deluge. The conditions described above are known consequences of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (SAG) and solar radiation management (SRM) . All available science data confirms the effect of geoengineering particulates on rainfall. Though main stream science sources are still not willing to openly admit to the fact that geoengineering programs have been fully deployed for decades, a growing mountain of evidence makes this fact indisputable. Again, the ongoing stratospheric geoengineering programs are greatly reducing overall rainfall ( as mentioned) and all but eliminating deep blue skies. This effect is known as ""global dimming"". Blocking the sun with reflective geoengineering aerosols reduces evaporation. Wind is reduced significantly in many cases from atmospheric aerosol saturation as the particles scatter solar energy and thus reduce convection from the ground that would otherwise occur from daytime heating. The slowing of the wind reduces evaporation even more. Further, precipitation cells that do form are often dispersed and diminished from the excessive amount of geoengineering particulates. This causes too many ""condensation nuclei"" and the droplets do not combine and fall as rain but migrate on. When the planets natural weather is suppressed or altered by climate engineering, energy builds up in the biosphere. This contributes to fuel catastrophic storms which will continue to increase along with catastrophic drought.

There is a mountain of scientific data to confirm the reality of ""global dimming'. Most have never even heard the term much less noticed the effect over recent decades. Though articles from mainstream publications admit to the ""global dimming"" issue, most understate the percentage of dimming and all point the finger at ""pollution particulates"" as the sole cause. Countless jet aircraft which crisscross our skies daily, dispersing millions of tons of toxic metal and chemical particulates, are completely ignored by all main stream media journalists and sources. To date main stream media has done its best to avoid even mentioning the subject of geoengineering much less admitting to these ongoing programs of total planetary devastation. The overall ramifications from global dimming and geoengineering cannot be accurately quantified. Loss of photo synthesis, destruction of the ozone layer, reduction in global rainfall, loss of blue sky, toxification of soils and waters, these are only a few of the known consequences of the global atmospheric spraying.

What does this imply? As already documented above, saturating the atmosphere with particulates shreds the protective layers of the atmosphere, namely the ozone layer. Particulate saturation in the upper atmosphere causes a chemical reaction which does the damage. There is now a massive Northern hemisphere ozone hole in addition to the Southern Hemisphere hole we have all heard about for decades. Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering is in all likelihood the primary cause of the global ozone depletion, not just ""CFC's"" as we have been told. Again, this has already been cited above and can be easily researched. Search ""geoengineering is destroying the ozone layer"". All available science makes this point clear. Without the ozone layer, life in any form would likely not exist on our planet. There is yet one more issue related to the destruction of our natural protection from the sun's usual radiation output: protection from solar flares. Coronal mass ejections or ""CME's"" can and will do horrific damage to our planet and most especially human infrastructure. If electricity grids are shut down due to a strong CME, the potential dangers are sobering indeed. With no grid power to cool nuclear power facilities for an extended time, we could face Fukushima x 100, or 200, or? Without cooling, meltdowns would eventually occur. Just one major nuclear catastrophe could exterminate life on the planet, let alone dozens or hundreds of them. Geoengineering is destroying our natural protection from such an event caused by a strong coronal mass ejection.

Climate engineering is radically altering upper and lower level wind currents which in turn trigger ocean current changes. Most are completely unaware of the wind and ocean current disruptions occurring around the globe. Even fewer are aware of the ramifications which are already unfolding from these changes. Ocean current changes are already delivering warmer waters to regions with vast undersea methane deposits. These deposits are known as ""methane hydrate"" deposits and literally hold life on earth in the balance. Many regions around the globe are beginning to expel methane from hydrate and clathrate deposits. The East Siberian Shelf of the Arctic is already releasing en masse. All available data indicates that this event alone is changing our biosphere by the day. Though groups of scientists like the ""Arctic Methane Emergency Group"" (AMEG) are calling for ""emergency wartime scale geoengineering to avert planetary catastrophe"", available data indicates that the very geoengineering programs (that AMEG is selling as a cure for the unfolding climate collapse), are more likely a major causal factor in triggering the methane catastrophe in the first place. The fully deployed planetary geoengineering programs have been altering wind and rain patterns at an ever increasing level for decades. Again, it is these alterations that have likely been a major factor in the triggering of mass methane release. Saturation of the atmosphere with methane is equivalent to covering the planet with a sheet of glass. The sun’s thermal energy gets in, but does not get out. Though most articles on methane release state methane to be 20 times more potent a greenhouse gas than Co2, this is over a 100 year time horizon. Over a ten year time horizon, methane is at least 100 times more potent. In addition to the atmospheric damage caused by the methane release, there is also ocean acidification. As the methane migrates from the sea floor to the surface, much is dissolved into the water (methane is also thawing in Arctic tundra and exploding into the atmosphere). Oceans are currently acidifying (and dying) at an extremely alarming rate. Again, the consequences of methane release alone threatens all life on Earth in the very near term.

The global geoengineering/weather modification/chemtrail programs have likely been going on for over seven decades. Recently found documents from the NASA archives indicate that these programs already had budgets into the hundreds of millions of dollars even by the mid 1960's (extensive senate documents have also been found and posted). These already massive climate altering programs were radically ramped up in the last 15 years. Though most of us alive today have perhaps known little truly ""natural"" weather, what we are experiencing today is anything but natural. The climate now ""swings"" radically from one extreme to another. It is now common to have spring like temperatures one day and snow (likely artificially nucleated) the next. These ""swings"" or ""fluctuations"" are getting ever more severe. Geoengineered ""weather whiplash"" scenarios are now the norm.

Manipulation Of The Jet Stream And The Shredding Of The Atmosphere



Is this really possible? Available science as well as observed weather events and jet stream ""anomalies"" say absolutely yes. HAARP is the acronym for a massively powerful ""ionosphere heater"" facility located in Alaska. This is a huge and extremely powerful antenna array which is capable of transmitting as much as three million watts of power into the ionosphere. This triggers an electrical chain reaction which then causes a 'bulge"" in the atmosphere, which in turn can alter the course of the jet stream. Such alterations can in turn ""steer"" weather systems. By such manipulation, storm fronts can be combined and worsened into ""frankenstorms"", or broken apart and dispersed. There are thought to be nearly 100 large ground based ""ionosphere heaters"" around the globe, some held by China and Russia. It has also become evident in recent years that ""weather warfare"" is already a lethal global reality. The potential of these frequency transmitter facilities is enhanced by the spraying of our skies. The saturation of the atmosphere with metal particulates makes the atmosphere more ""conductive"". This in turn increases the capabilities of the ionosphere heaters.

Dry Lightning And Out Of Control Forest Fires

An atmosphere that is more conductive from metal particulate saturation can produce more frequent lightning. These same particulates also have the net effect of ""diminishing and dispersing"" rain. Forests around the globe are now filled with dead and dying trees (referenced later in this article). In addition, the foliage of trees are now covered with what amounts to an ""incendiary"" dust from the geoengineering particulates. Add the shredded ozone layer which creates more heat, and the ""weather modified"" conditions are even worse. The obvious result is more frequent and catastrophic forest fires. This phenomenon is being played out around the globe. Summer of 2012 saw the Northern Hemisphere burning down and now it is Australia and Tasmania in meltdown (global forest fire incineration is accelerating).

Yet another seemingly impossible aspect of global weather modification is geoengineered snow storms. Many will write this one off as impossible without any investigation. That is a mistake as the science of chemical ice nucleation for weather modification is very established and has long since been commonly practiced in many countries, though it is hard to comprehend this process being done on such a massive scale. There are several patents on ""artificial ice nucleation for weather modification"", including one from NASA. Artificially nucleated storms appear to be carried out under a myriad of conditions. In many cases, storms that should have yielded only rain, can be artificially nucleated to ""change over"" to snow. The term ""change over"" has recently been coined by The Weather Channel and other corporate/military/industrial complex weather agencies. A geoengineered snow event is generally called ""heavy wet snow"" (another recent term). This ""snow"" can begin to fall at temperatures far above freezing though the ongoing chemical process eventually cools the surrounding air mass. The resulting ""snow"" and ""ice"" can sometimes remain a surprisingly long time in spite of warmer temperatures, a result of artificial chemical nucleation. This aspect of weather modification is covered in the following article, ""Geoengineered Snow Storms Wreaking Havoc Around the Globe"".

Temporary Cooling At The Cost Of A Worsened Overall Warming



This is the net result of geoengineering. Nature does not give something for nothing. This should seem all too obvious, but unfortunately the ""scientists"" in so many cases are completely blind to the consequences of their experiments. In the case of cloud seeding to produce rain, if they succeed, then that moisture will not end up where it would have otherwise gone. In the case of saturation spraying that is known to diminish rain by scattering it into massive artificial cloud cover and haze, where will all that moisture end up? Coming down somewhere else in a deluge? Is this perhaps why the US west is locked in record drought and US east is having record rains? The cooling effects of geoengineering come at the cost of a much worsened overall warming of the planet. Even NASA admits the ""condensation trails"" (geoengineering particulate trails) are warming the planet.

The Systemic Poisoning Of All Life On Earth



Does this sound like an ""alarmist"" statement or conspiracy theory? All available data points to this conclusion as a hard and undeniable fact for any that do objective research. Countless lab tests of precipitation from around the globe (cited above) have been done by concerned individuals and groups in recent years, and the results are shocking to say the least. Our rain and snow is quite literally packed with the very same highly toxic heavy metals named in numerous geoengineering patents as primary elements. The air we breath is also laden with the same toxins aluminum/alumina, barium, strontium, manganese, thorium, and now even fluoride is being reported in recent tests from Norway. So much metal has fallen on the boreal forests of the Pacific Northwest that soil PH changes of up to 15 times more alkaline have been noted. A recent documentary film by filmmaker George Barnes titled ""Look Up"" covers some of these changes and the forest die off that is occurring in boreal forests. Though there are countless articles documenting the die off of forests around the globe, putting the blame only on increasing temperatures, drought, and beetles, none mention geoengineering. To omit geoengineering in this equation is to omit what appears to be the greatest single factor of all. The lethal effects of ""bioavailable"" aluminum/alumina in rainwater and thus in the soils is well documented. Its effect on trees is also noted in science studies. Of course there are corporations who exist to profit from calamity. Monsanto always seems to be at the top of this list. As geoengineered drought and aluminum sterilized soils force independent farmers to sell, international ag corporations are there to buy up the land and put to use their ""aluminum resistant seeds.""

What Is Geoengineering Doing To Us?



Inhalation of microscopic particulates is highly damaging no matter what the particulate material, the metallic particles in question are especially lethal. Respiratory ailments and mortalities are now literally epidemic. Degenerative human diseases that are linked to heavy metal exposure are now going virtually off the charts. ADD, Alzheimer's, Autism, ALL, immune disfunction, and many other diseases associated with heavy metals, have all skyrocketed in recent years. According to scientists like internationally know neuroscientist Russell Blaylock, the heavy metal nano particles are so small that they pass right through the lung lining into the blood stream. There they can adhere to cell receptors like a plaque, slowly but surely shutting down bodily functions and the immune system. These metals are all but impossible to remove once they have become lodged in the body. In addition, virtually every bite we eat is now contaminated with these toxic nano particles as they are absorbed by plant life, which is highly damaging to crops. Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (AKA solar radiation management) has now tainted all. Every breath we take, every bite we eat, all is contaminated. A mountain of data, studies, and testing confirms this conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. We are all quite literally under assault. The threat to all life on earth from the global weather modification programs cannot be overstated. It is up to all of us to help in the task of bringing these programs to light, and to a halt so the planet can begin to recover. Arm yourself with copies of credible articles, data, and DVD copies to help spread the word on this most dire issue. It is likely the vast majority of military and private sector people involved with geoengineering do not understand the consequences of what they are involved in. Time is not on our side. Every day global geoengineering continues, our odds are diminished. We must all pull together in the effort to shine the light on this greatest of all human crimes. Once the geoengineering issue is truly out in the open, and those who physically carry out the spraying realize what they are a part of, we have a chance to stop these lethal programs. Reaching a critical mass of public awareness is the only way forward.

868,"Valence states of iron and oxygen in FeO Hx

The valence state of Fe can be characterized by near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) features at energy slightly below the iron K-edge20. Because of the strong absorption of 7 keV X-ray by diamond anvils, the XAS spectra were collected in the partial fluorescence yield (PFY) geometry for the iron superoxide at 53–133 GPa. That is, the incident X-ray beam passes through one diamond anvil, and then the X-ray fluorescence exits in the radial direction through the Be gasket to avoid double diamond absorption. The peak position and intensity distribution are diagnostic probes for valence state, spin state, geometry, and the ligand–ligand interactions for Fe atoms20. The iron K pre-edge feature that is related to the 1s → 3d electronic transition, is particularly sensitive to the valence state of iron21. Our XAS-PFY measurements of other representative iron compounds at ambient conditions explicitly show that the position of iron K pre-edge absorption increases with increasing valence state (Fig. 1a top). The position of iron K pre-edge of the iron superoxide FeO is very close, but slightly below, that of Fe2+ compounds. That is, the valence state of iron in FeO is plausibly close to +2. Its position remains almost constant from 53 to 81 GPa, suggesting a minimal pressure dependence on the valence state of iron22, consistent with mantle ferropericlase and bridgmanite. Furthermore, it is intriguing that the iron valence state of the hydrogen-free iron superoxide is similar to that of the hydrogen-bearing Py-FeO Hx with x = 0.5–0.7 at 133 GPa. These observations indicate that the hydrogen content has minimal effects on the valence state of iron in the superoxide (Fig. 1a).

With the valence state of iron slightly under +2, the valence state of oxygen for the Py-FeO would have to be nearly −1, suggesting that oxygen atoms must interact with each other in the iron superoxide. Such interaction can be observed experimentally from the oxygen K-edge spectroscopy. We note that the edge at 540 eV is in a very soft X-ray region inaccessible to XAS in DAC experiments. Instead, we can access the oxygen K-edge by X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) using hard X-ray in and hard X-ray out method, where the energy loss is measured due to inelastic Raman shift23,24. For XRS measurements on the oxygen K-edge, we deliberately used LiF as a pressure transmitting-medium, instead of water or O , to assure XRS signals of oxygen only from the Py-FeO Hx (Supplementary Figure 3). In the XRS at 110 GPa, we observed a sharp oxygen π* peak near 531 eV and a broad σ * peak at 540–550 eV (Fig. 1b). These peaks represent the O electron transition from 1s core orbitals to the antibonding 1π * and 3σ * orbitals, respectively (termed as π* and σ* transitions). The strong π* transition indicates the presence of the O–O dimer.

Magnetic and electronic spin states of iron in FeO Hx

Magnetic ordering and spin state of Fe in iron superoxide can be investigated using synchrotron Mössbauer scattering (SMS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), respectively. 57Fe is a Mössbauer active isotope with nuclear resonant energy of 14.41 keV. A series of SMS spectra of the iron superoxide were collected upon decompression in steps from 118 GPa down to 32 GPa (Fig. 2a), and the experiment was repeated in three separated runs (Supplementary Figures 6–8) of FeO Hx with different x (Supplementary Table 1). SMS spectra were analyzed using CONUSS program25 to extract the quadrupole splitting (QS) and isomer shift (IS) of iron in the Py-phase which is compared with that of standard samples of ferrous pyrite FeS , ferrous Fe Mg O, and ferric Fe O (Fig. 2b). The QS of iron in the Py-phase barely increased with increasing pressure, whereas the IS displayed an opposite trend. The pressure dependence of QS and IS for iron in the superoxide is comparable to that for ferrous iron (Fe2+) in ferropericlase (Mg, Fe)O in the low-spin state (refs. 26,27), likely due to the ferrous nature of the iron superoxide. It is noted that the spin transition could largely affect the QS of iron in (Mg, Fe)O (refs. 27,28). Furthermore, the values of the QS and IS of iron in the superoxide extrapolated to ambient conditions are about 0.27 and 0.55 mm s−1, in excellent agreement with that in pyrite FeS (ref. 29).

Our SMS spectra in Fig. 2a consistently showed that the Py-phase remained in the non-magnetic state represented by the clean, single beat spectra, regardless of the content of hydrogen in the lattice. SMS data with multiple time beats indicating magnetic ordering appeared only below 40–50 GPa when the iron superoxide decomposed into a magnetic phase under decompression. We note that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) for the diffraction peaks for the iron superoxide broadened significantly below 65 GPa and the peak intensity continually decreased until they finally disappeared around 40 GPa upon decompression at room temperature. Furthermore, the QS and IS values of iron in the magnetic phase are close to that in hematite (Fe O ) at 32 GPa. It is consistent with our recent X-ray diffraction (XRD) observations where the new diffraction peaks can be indexed to hematite below 40 GPa.

The magnetic spin states of 3d electrons are also directly probed by XES spectra of the Fe K fluorescence lines5,30 of the iron superoxide between 40 and 133 GPa (Fig. 3). The intensity of the \(K_\beta ^\prime\) satellite peak of iron in the superoxide decreased between 45 and 60 GPa and disappeared completely at 60–65 GPa where the total spin momentum (S) of iron in the Py-phase approached zero, indicating that iron in the Py-phase undergoes a gradual electronic spin-pairing transition below 65 GPa from high-spin to low-spin states (Supplementary Figure 9). We note that the XES spectra were collected with decreasing pressure and thus the spin transition pressure may be higher due to pressure hysteresis on the spin crossover upon decompression31. These observations also suggest that the iron superoxide is not stable in the high-spin state and would decompose into oxygen and hematite across the electronic spin transition of iron, associated with the valence change in oxygen and iron at the same time.

Oxygen bonding and charge transfer in FeO and FeO H

For pyrite-type structures, the covalent nature is mainly controlled by the anion–anion distance (D ). We followed previous strategies32,33 and used the fractional coordination y of oxygen to compare O–O distance at different pressures:

where a is the lattice parameter as a function of pressure. The archetypical pyrite FeS with y = 0.385 forms solid anion dimers with divalent Fe cations at ambient conditions. In contrast, conventional dioxides with tetravalent cations (e.g. RuO and OsO ) have a smaller value of 0.34–0.35 for y in the pyrite-type structure33. Our previous experimental XRD data showed y = 0.371 with D = 1.937 Å in the iron superoxide at 75 GPa which lies between conventional dioxides and peroxides9,33. Due to the importance of the O–O bond length, we collected XRD patterns on a nearly pure FeO sample at 96 GPa, which have been further analyzed by using the Rietveld method for the primary phase of FeO and the LeBail method for the weaker O and Fe O phases. The final refinement factors are R = 0.069 and wR = 0.14. The bond length (D ) for FeO is ~1.87(1) Å and the lattice parameter is 4.2855(3) Å with y = 0.374 at 96 GPa. Therefore, compared with various peroxides synthesized at ambient pressure34, the O–O bonding length in the iron superoxide is relatively longer. With 0.35 < y < 0.39, iron–oxygen octahedrons are chained by the O–O bonding as shown in Fig. 4a.

We further conducted first-principles simulations (see Methods) to construct the charge density landscape at 100 GPa (Fig. 4). Following the Bader charge division scheme, we determined the charge of the Fe atoms are 6.38 e by DFT + U and 6.32 e by the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) screened hybrid functional (screening variable of 0.15) free of the empirical Hubbard parameter U. Based on our experimental observations that Py-FeO Hx is in the non-magnetic state, the O–O bond length values from our GGA + U calculations are consistent with our XRD experimental results as well as Lu et al.35. We note that the O–O bonding length is sensitive to computational and physical environments and that either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic configurations would yield a longer O–O bond by ~10%35. The valence state of iron is +1.62 (DFT + U) or +1.68 (HSE) and that of oxygen is −0.81 (DFT + U) or −0.84 (HSE) for FeO (Table 1). It is known that Bader analysis may underestimate the charge transfer between anions and cations36. Our calculations may not indicate the exact valence values, but clearly show charge transfer between anions, which has also been seen in the calculations of archetypal pyrite FeS (ref. 37). In hydrogen-bearing Py-FeO H, hydrogen is equally bonded with two nearest oxygen atoms38. As a result, hydrogen is calculated to be +0.64 at 100 GPa. Oxygen atoms adopt electrons from hydrogen and become −1.13 while the valence state of iron remains around +1.63 for the Py-FeO H. Therefore, hydrogen only donates electrons to oxygen atoms and has a minimal effect on the valence state of iron.",mainstream
262,"A long, flat hunk of space rock that has eluded scientists since it zipped past our planet last year may, in fact, be a piece of alien technology, according to a new paper by Harvard scientists.

The paper — written by Abraham Loeb, chair of astronomy, and Shmuel Bialy, a postdoctoral fellow, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics — was submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

In it, they hypothesize that 'Oumuamua — the cigar-shaped object that briefly visited us from a distant star system — ""may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization.""

""I follow the maxim of Sherlock Holmes,"" Loeb told As It Happens host Carol Off. ""When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.""

The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed, and several scientists, including those who have studied 'Oumuamua, are skeptical of Loeb's conclusions.

'Oumuamua was discovered in October 2017 by Canadian astronomer Robert Weryk at the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy.

It is our first known interstellar visitor — and scientists have struggled to explain it.

""It's very weird. It's nothing that we have seen before,"" Loeb said. ""It seems to have an extreme shape based on the reflectance of sunlight. It has very strange dimensions. It is at least five to 10 times longer than it is wide.""

At first, researchers declared 'Oumuamua an asteroid — a large body of mostly rock with very little water. Upon closer inspection, it was later deemed a comet, which are made up of mostly dust and ice.

But 'Oumuamua isn't behaving like a comet either.

For one, it has deviated from the trajectory it was expected to travel given the sun's gravitational pull.

A comet can do that when it releases gases, producing a rocket effect known as outgassing. But 'Oumuamua doesn't have the telltale comet tail associated with outgassing.

What's more, outgassing should have sent 'Oumuamua spinning, but no rotation has been detected.

So what sent this big mystery hunk veering through space at an accelerated speed off of its natural course?

""There is something pushing it in addition to gravity,"" Loeb said.

""The possibility that we are suggesting is that it's sunlight — the radiation from the sun is giving a push, and in order for that to be effective, it needs to be very thin.""

So thin, he says, it might be artificial.

One thing that fits that description is a light sail, also known as a solar sail — a type of propulsion that allows a spacecraft to move under the force of sunlight radiation reflected on large mirrors.

Essentially, a light-sail spacecraft sails through space on the sunlight.

Loeb is the chair of the advisory committee for Breakthrough Starshot, an organization that is working to launch a light sail to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri.

'Oumuamua, he says, may be an alien version of that very same technology.

""This could be space debris that is a piece of equipment. It could be defunct. It may not be operational,"" Loeb said.

""But at the same time, it could be leftover space debris from another civilization, just because it's so peculiar and nothing like the rocks that we see in the solar system.""

'No reason to believe' alien theory: scientist

Weryk, the Canadian scientist who discovered 'Oumuamua and has researched it, has cast doubt on Loeb's extracurricular theory.

""There is no reason to believe 'Oumuamua is anything but a natural object (a comet from another solar system) based on the observations that were obtained by the team I worked with,"" Weryk told Motherboard, Vice's science site.

""It is true though, that there really is a lot we do not know about interstellar comets, and it really will take us finding more of them to better understand them. This may take a while, but now that we know they exist, we are looking more closely at each new [near-Earth object] discovery we make.""

Ars Technica writer Eric Berger suggested that news outlets have seized on Loeb's unproven theory because of its ""classic clickbait headline.""

But as for Loeb, he says he's motivated only by curiosity and the pursuit of truth.

""I don't play it based on what I expect my colleagues to say, I do it based on my interests,"" he said. ""And the fact that the public is interested, that is a benefit.""

1167,"TEBOURBA, Tunisia — Hidden behind the Mahjoub olive press, a row of millstones traces the long history of olive oil production in this corner of Northern Africa.

At one end, there are the stones used by five generations of the Mahjoub family: flat, heavy discs at least a meter across, made of granite or volcanic rock. At the other lie cylinders of rough-hewn rock, which crushed olives when Tunisia lay within the province of Africa in the Roman Empire.

“We found them in our fields. They are from the 2nd century A.D.,” said Abdelwahab Mahjoub, the family historian.

By the time the millstones were used, olive oil was a major export product.

Today, Tunisia hopes to capitalize on this pedigree to boost its struggling economy, and the EU is eager to help — much to the chagrin of some in Rome today: politicians and farm union leaders who argue that a flood of cheap African oil will undercut the Italian market.

In spring this year, the European Parliament voted to waive taxes on olive oil imports from Tunisia, allowing Tunisian producers to export 35,000 tons tax-free in 2016 and 2017, part of its effort to stabilize the country’s economy at a time when the security of North Africa has become one of the European Union's most pressing strategic concerns.

Brussels proposed the measures in the aftermath of a terror attack in the beach resort of Sousse in 2015, in which 38 people died. The EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini argued that ""exceptional times call for exceptional measures.""

The EU has already spent billions on financial assistance to Tunisia since the Jasmine Revolution in 2011 and recently proposed doubling its annual aid to €300 million. It’s not a selfless investment: the bloc needs Tunisia as a partner in migration and security management.

Despite its successful revolution and gradual transition to democracy, Tunisia has grappled with high unemployment rates and slow economic growth. Its struggles were exacerbated by deadly terror attacks on the coastal resort and national museum last year, which decimated the Tunisian tourism industry.

Olive oil, the World Bank noted, may have single-handedly saved the country’s economy from total collapse: Tunisia’s meager growth in 2015 was “only thanks to a strong performance in agricultural production, particularly olive production.”

Marielle de Sarnez, the French MEP who led the European Parliament's work on the olive oil proposal, said the tax-free quota would “provide essential help for Tunisia, and is not likely to destabilize the European market.”

Italian politicians, however, feared that the measure would harm their own olive oil sector, which was badly affected by a disease causing trees to wither. Tunisian production levels, in turn, soared past Italy's last year, making Tunisia the second-largest producer after Spain.

Beppe Grillo, founder of the anti-establishment 5Star Movement, slammed imports of Tunisian oil as an invasion that was hauling down prices. ""It's no accident that farmers are on a war footing,"" he said.

The tax break will “definitely help” Tunisia, Abdelwahab Mahjoub believes. Tunisia’s economy heavily depends on olive oil, which makes up 10 percent of the country’s exports. The olive oil sector employs an estimated 400,000 people — a significant number for the 11 million-strong nation.

In Tebourba, a town slightly northwest of Tunis where the Mahjoubs produce their oil, agriculture is the main source of employment. “But much work is seasonal,” Mahjoub said. “The future is transformation, commercialization and distribution — too much is exported as a raw product.”

The majority of Tunisian olive oil is exported in bulk to Italy, where it is mixed and bottled, and sold as “made in Italy.” This exposes one of the great paradoxes of the Italian position. Despite the howls of protest from some quarters, Italian producers can make healthy profits by bottling and branding cheap imports from Tunisia and Greece.

But “made in Tunisia” exports are on the rise — some 20,000 tons of oil bottled in Tunisia were shipped across the world last year, compared to a mere 400 tons 10 years ago.

Les Moulins Mahjoub, the family business run by Abdelwahab and his two brothers, was one of the first to export under their own brand. Their olive oil is now found in the United States, Canada and the bakery restaurant chain Le Pain Quotidien. “We opened the door to others,” Mahjoub said proudly. “Now 10 percent is exported under the producers’ own label.”

The government, too, is keen to put Tunisian olive oil on the map, though it still faces stiff competition from Italy, Greece and Spain. Tunisia’s advantage over the three giants is that the production process across the country is more or less organic: unlike in European countries, Tunisian growers use little machinery and rarely resort to pesticides.

“In theory, the whole production of Tunisia can be converted to organic,” said Walid Gaddas, who advises the Tunisian government on promoting locally made olive oils. “It is entirely natural. Even the harvest is collected by hand.”

Driving off the motorway and onto the Mahjoubs’ 200-hectare estate near Tebourba, a scene unfolds that would not look out of place in Roman times: beside rows upon rows of gnarled olive trees, women plant garlic in the midday sun, while a man and a donkey drive furrows into the russet-colored earth.

Some tasks, such as fertilizing the ground, are still carried out by machines. But Majid Mahjoub, Abdelwahab’s younger brother, has plans to rid the production of machinery entirely. The brothers employ 200 people — mostly women, often three generations of the same family — and even more during harvest season.

But when I asked Majid about this year’s harvest, his expression darkens. This year, Tunisia has experienced an unusually long summer with little rain, leaving reservoirs empty. The nationwide water shortage has led to protests.

“It’s a catastrophic drought,” Majid said. Usually the fields are irrigated 24 hours a day, seven days a week this time of year. Forced to conserve water, the Mahjoubs had to reduce it to half a day, twice a week. “We might lose half the harvest.”

The agricultural sector is at nature’s mercy by definition, but to Majid, this year’s drought is a sign of things to come. “You know, we are living climate change,” he said. “When China or the U.S. don’t accept a climate deal, it hits countries like ours hard.”

But Gaddas, the government consultant, described the lack of rain as a freak occurrence, even though a study has found that drought fueled by climate change could cut in half Tunisia’s olive oil production by 2030.

In any case, Gaddas said, production was expected to be low this year, as olive trees bear less fruit every other year.

“Last year we got 350,000 tons of olive oil” — a record high — “so this year we will have a maximum of 100,000,” he said. “Demand keeps increasing. I’m not concerned about the future of Tunisian olive oil.”

After all, he added, the region had been growing olives for millennia: “In Cape Bon, in the northeast of Tunisia, there is a tree believed to be 2,500 years old,” Gaddas said. “And it’s still producing olives.”",mainstream
464,"Preppers weren’t overreacting: Americans were taken by SURPRISE because they didn’t take coronavirus seriously

Prepping is an unusual and work-intensive way of life, but many people who consider themselves preppers don’t regret their choices one bit. After all, prepping teaches you the value of self-sustainability and emergency preparedness.

Now that the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has been classified as a pandemic, preppers can rely on their stockpiles and many preps. But others in America can’t say the same, especially those who are panic buying when they should have been preparing for something like this before SHTF.

There’s a reason why preppers work so hard to get ready before SHTF

Preppers knew disaster would eventually strike, but you won’t hear them gloating because of someone’s lack of foresight.

Whether in fiction or mainstream media, preppers have often been portrayed in an unflattering light, like the rambling conspiracy theorist to the oddball gun enthusiast. However, preppers in real life know better than to engage with those who belittle their efforts to get ready for all kinds of disasters.

Compared to civilians who have lost their composure while panic buying toilet paper, preppers can rest easy because they have spent a lot of time and effort to set up their survival stockpiles. Instead of haphazardly hoarding things they might not need, preppers have planned each trip to the store to get bang for their buck.

But it’s not too late for panicking non-preppers.

Stay calm, and if you need advice, there may be an experienced prepper more than willing to give you tips on how to set up your necessary preps.

Sit down, draft, revise and finalize your emergency preparedness plan and make a list of items that you will need for a long-term SHTF scenario. (Related: Coronavirus spread in the USA is “inevitable,” warns CDC: How to prep for an outbreak.)

Don’t add to the mass panic that’s unsettling the rest of the country. If the panic buying doesn’t let up, more people will run out of necessities when things get bleak.

Stop hoarding toilet paper. If your local store has run out, consider alternatives like baby wipes or eco-friendly options like a bidet.

If you do settle on bidets, you also need to have a backup source of clean water, just in case you end up facing a long-term water outage.

Are your neighbors panicking? If you have the time, talk to them about prepping and give them tips. The more people you convince to start prepping, the more prepared your whole neighborhood will be when disaster strikes.

Below are some tips for people who want to start prepping before it’s too late:
• Start stockpiling emergency supplies. Check your pantry and make a list of things that you need. The basics include enough food for the whole family, clean drinking water, toiletries and cleaning products. Prioritize hygiene and sanitation, especially during a coronavirus pandemic.
• Set achievable goals. If you’re new to prepping, don’t take on too much on your first few days. Gather enough supplies for at least six to eight weeks. When you’re done, and you’ve gotten the hang of organizing your preps, try to gather enough for three months or more.
• Practice social distancing. Coronavirus is an infectious disease, and limiting your contact with other people is the best way to protect yourself. If you do need to leave your house for supplies, stay at least six feet away from others.
• Maintain proper hygiene. Wash your hands regularly using running water and soap or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (with 62 to 75 percent ethanol) to eliminate pathogens.

During times like this, it’s important to remain calm and use all your prepping and survival skills.

While preppers value independence and self-sufficiency, teaching non-preppers what you know is also the best way to help others get ready for a coronavirus pandemic.",conspiracy
194,"John Avlon is a senior political analyst at CNN. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Politicians were feeling pressure during the pandemic. Businesses were agitating to reopen and deaths were going down, especially far away from the coastal cities that it had hit worst, first. It seemed time to declare ""mission accomplished"" and get the economy humming again -- especially with an election looming.

It was 1918 and Denver Mayor William Fitz Randolph Mills bowed to business leaders and decided to back off social distancing. Armistice Day seemed like a perfect day to do it. The city had been all but locked down for five weeks and now there was something worth celebrating -- the end of the First World War. Grateful citizens streamed into the streets of the city on November 11, 1918, soon after Denver's Manager of Health William H. Sharpley declared the ""plague under control!""

His enthusiasm was premature but understandable: Denver officials could point to progress in containing the disease at that time, compared with other cities like Chicago. Their first recorded influenza-related death had been on September 27, when a student from University of Denver named Blanche Kennedy died of pneumonia after visiting Chicago.

Even in those early days of public health, with limited scientific remedies, social distancing and masks were understood to help stem the tide of pandemic. In the town of Montrose, Colorado, as the Denver Post recounted, a health officer named Isaiah Knott warned his fellow citizens that ""if you are sick and do not stay away from social gatherings, you have the heart of a hun,"" using a derogatory term for the Germans the US was fighting at the time. But superstition often overwhelmed science, as officials recommended that people avoid wearing tight shoes and recommended people have a ""clean mouth, clean heart and clean clothes."" Quack ""cures"" proliferated, peddling their wares to the gullible and the desperate, as we see today in all kinds of coronavirus scams and pseudo science. (Check out this Reality Check with all the sordid details).

But folks were bristling at being asked to stay indoors in the picturesque autumn and businesses -- especially movie theaters -- were irritated at losing so much money because of what seemed like a relatively isolated pandemic. They argued it was better to simply quarantine those who showed symptoms and let everyone else go about their business.

There's an obvious echo to the pressures politicians are feeling today -- especially in states like Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp seems more intent on playing to the base than listening to scientists. He was late to the lockdown and now wants to open up early. But then again, he's the same governor -- of the CDC's home state -- who said it was news to him that asymptomatic people could spread the disease, two months after it was common knowledge.

Another pattern in past pandemics is trying to scapegoat immigrants and vulnerable communities for spreading the disease. Immigrants, the poor and Native American tribes were being accused of spreading the disease across Colorado. Despite the name Spanish flu the disease is believed to have begun at US Army Camp Funston in Kansas earlier that year before spreading across the world, killing an estimated 50 million, including members of my family. Wealthy socialites flouted social distancing requirements with little recourse. It seemed better to back off the draconian measures and just focus on precautions while stigmatizing the sick, placing placards on the houses where there had been a case of influenza.

This may have sounded reasonable at the time, but it did not have the intended result.

Instead of being at the end of the influenza's toll on Denver, the city was only halfway through its ordeal. By backing off social distancing too early, they utterly failed to flatten the curve, and suffered a second bump, as this graph of cities by National Geographic shows.

Premature declarations of victory guarantee defeat. Buckling to protests increased the number of dead.

But the protesters a century ago did not have the advantages of precedent or modern science to learn best practices. We do now, which makes the protesters who are projecting their partisan paranoid-style politics on the pandemic look like members of the flat earth society competing to win the Darwin Awards . It's worse, of course, that the President of the United States is encouraging them against the advice of his own scientific experts.

As Harry Truman said , ""The only thing new in the world is the history you don't know."" Public health is among the most difficult government actions -- when actions work they seem like overreactions. What's unforgivable is for leaders to remain willfully ignorant of history and therefore doomed to repeat it. Their weak-kneed decisions could result in the death of someone you love.

1329,"This strange substance likely can’t form naturally on Earth, but it might be abundant on the hydrocarbon-rich surface of Titan, the scientists report in the journal ACS Earth and Space Chemistry. If so, the discovery offers new ways of studying this intriguing moon’s evolution and environments—including its potential to host life unlike anything seen on Earth.

“We had our fingers crossed that it would do something interesting,” Cable says of the experiment.

Several years ago, Cable and her colleagues were reading about curious formations around Titan’s famous hydrocarbon lakes. Data from NASA’s Cassini mission to Saturn suggested that as the lakes dry up, a mysterious substance is left behind, like the scummy ring that lingers after draining a bathtub. The team wondered, what could these remnants be made of? (Explore Cassini’s grand tour of the Saturn system with our interactive.)

As they began puzzling through the possibilities, the researchers started with the notion that it should be the least soluble substance in Titan’s methane and ethane lakes. So, they targeted benzene and ethane, which resist mixing like oil and water. If some of the lake liquid were to evaporate, they reasoned, benzene would be the first thing left behind.

In the lab, a mix of these compounds did indeed form crystals. To learn more about them, the team fired lasers at the crystals and recorded what scattered back, a method known as Raman spectroscopy, which can reveal information about the interactions between molecules and the nature of their chemical bonds.

“One of my colleagues took a look at the spectrum and said, Huh that’s weird,” Cable recalls. It seems benzene arranged itself around the ethane into an unusual organic crystal. Buoyed by this result, the team started trying other combinations of Titan substances to see what might form.",mainstream
670,"The Robe (20th Century-Fox), ablaze with Technicolor and alive with romance, action and Biblical pageantry, is Hollywood at its supercolossal best. It also represents an important new technical advanceCinemaScopethat may ultimately doom 3-D as well as ordinary ""flat"" movies. For the first feature in gigantic CinemaScope, Producer Frank Ross came forward with a gigantic story: early Christianity under the Roman Empire. Based on the famed bestseller of the late Rev. Lloyd C. Douglas, the film contains more piety than wit and more spectacle than humanity, but it is ably served by a competent cast headed by Britain's Richard (My Cousin Rachel) Burton.

As an epicurean Roman grudgingly won over to evangelical Christianity, highborn Burton is the successful rival of Prince Regent Caligula (Jay Robinson) for the hand of Jean Simmons, a ward of the Emperor Tiberius. When he further annoys the evil Caligula by outbidding him for a particularly stiff-necked Greek slave (Victor Mature), Burton is exiled to Palestine, where he lolls decadently in the baths and drinks wine while his slave Mature becomes a convert to the new religion.

Handed the routine military job of supervising the execution of Christ (""a fanatical troublemaker ""), Burton passes the time on Calvary by winning Christ's robe in a dice game. In the earth-shaking storm that follows the Crucifixion, Burton loses his robe, his slave and apparently his sanity. Returned to Italy, he becomes convinced that he was bewitched by the dead Messiah, and accepts an imperial commission to go back to Palestine to investigate the un-Roman activities of the new sect. He finds Mature and the robe at Cana, in Galilee, but exposure to the gentle habits of the Cana Christians puts him on the road to conversion. The final act is played in Rome, with Caligula on the throne and the Christians hiding in the catacombs. The picture ends as Burton defends his new faith before the demented Emperor.

Director Henry Koster and Scriptwriter Philip Dunne have made a real effort to avoid the pitfalls of Biblical movies by balancing the saintly preaching of Dean Jagger (as Justus) and Michael Rennie (as Peter) with the muscular Christianity of Burton and Mature. There is a minimum of the sex and sadism that usually characterize Hollywood's explorations of Holy Writ. The CinemaScope screen is handsomely utilized for swordplay, torture chambers and a thundering chase sequence as well as for dramatic shots of the Way of the Cross and Christ's entrance into Jerusalem the week before the Crucifixion. Alfred Newman's music is especially effective in the Palm Sunday hymn and in a ballad charmingly sung by Betta (South Pacific) St. John.",mainstream
742,"The world has at last finished reeling from the Bird Flu and Swine Flu epidemics that swept a swathe of carnage across the entire planet and almost killed dozens of people the world over.

Known as pandemics, they were widely believed to be worse than epidemics because they have the word “pan” in them and are named after animals.

They caused several pharmaceutical giants to reel ashen-faced from the torment of accidentally making lots of money from the sale of vaccines that caused the “lemming flu” armageddonodemic for which there is no known cure except not being injected with vaccines that contain antifreeze, lark’s vomit and ocelot spit even when told to by governments and other criminal conspiracies.

Just when the reeling seemed to be over and the Daily Scare, Ministry of Hysteria and other members of POCS (Profits Over Common Sense) have been left to guard dangerously diminished stocks of fear and other supplies essential to controlling people and other enemies of democracy, a new hero has ridden to the rescue out of the majestic – and, indeed, radioactive – sunset.

This latest mutation of the flu virus is so devastating in its effects and threatens to afflict so many people across the world and similar planets that scientists and health officials the world over have been sent scouring the deepest recesses of Roget’s Thesaurus for a word to embrace the new disease with a fittingly chilling epithet.

Controversy is now raging throughout the scientific world over whether to call this new outbreak a catastrophodemic or a letsallcrapourpantsodemic or even a youmightaswellgiveupthewilltoliveodemic. All is not lost however: the scientific community remains confident that some sectors of the population will emerge in fine fettle from the worst disaster to blight humanity since the invention of the atom bomb or Monsanto and begin the job of repopulating the Earth with chemically enhanced voters.

Such sectors include, of course, pharmaceutical giants, manufacturing giants, food giants and other genetically modified corporations.

In order to counter the coming catastrophodemic, a new vaccine is being hastily prepared by crack teams of press release writers working flat out in bunkers buried deep beyond the dreams of avarice. Chemically indistinguishable from athlete’s foot powder – or, indeed, athlete’s foot – the new vaccine will be made available for the price of a nearly-new Ford Fiesta and by “available” we do, of course, mean compulsory.

The vaccine does have a few minor side effects. It causes brain atrophy in people who own shares in pharmaceutical companies, loss of impulse control by presidents and news editors and death. Proponents of the vaccine however point out that death only occurs in the case of people who inject, eat, drink, absorb or inhale the vaccine and all the deaths have occurred only in foreigners or people who would have stopped breathing eventually anyway.

The vaccine, known as Incense8, represents a major advance in vaccination technology, with the application to health care of a principle known to military leaders for centuries but hitherto only applied to invading armies, the working classes, the American Mid West and other enemies. Known as SEP, the Scorched Earth Principle, it is the process of rendering one’s territory unusable by an invading army (or indeed liberating army, landowners, tenants or, in fact, anybody should the invading army be defeated) its application has been extended to combating invasion of a host by a popular virus.

Incense8, thought to be effective in 100% of sales pitches, works on this SEP principle by rendering the human organism so ill that it becomes unattractive to any virus that happens by, in the way that a roach infested bungalow tends to be unattractive to a prospective squatter. The virus then goes elsewhere in search of a host more fit for viral habitation.

The new virus is – according to sufferers – right up there with leprosy and SARS, in fact in the league table of deadly killers, sits just below flu vaccines, processed foods and American foreign policy.

Its symptoms are reportedly pretty horrible to witness and at this stage can only be recognised by women. They include:
• The sufferer become convinced that death is imminent and makes pathetic pleas for sympathy
• Sufferer becomes unable to withstand even a mild headache or runny nose and retires to bed for a week or more of writhing in agony
• Women in the vicinity of the sufferer begin to roll their eyes and, in desperation, resort to sarcasm
• Sufferer can often rally and make a miraculous recovery if the possibility of nookie is hinted at.
• The sufferer can often be found going on line to compare symptoms with the symptoms of all known diseases and will often discover that he is suffering from any disease he reads about.

Reports are coming in that the new flu virus only attacks men. Woman appear to be immune.

In the light of the last fact, it was only inevitable that there would be a break with the tradition of naming epidemics after animals.

The new “Alleged-Killer Virus” is known as the Man Flu.

983,"A Gatineau councillor who was already under fire for denying the existence of Islamophobia is drawing new scrutiny for recent comments questioning whether the Earth is round.

Nathalie Lemieux created a controversy last week after she told a reporter the word ""Islamophobia"" doesn't exist for her. She then apologized for those remarks.

She was stripped of her title as deputy mayor but remains a councillor.

In an interview Tuesday, Gatineau Mayor Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin acknowledged Lemieux's comments about Islamophobia could be harmful.

""Yes, it could affect the (city's) reputation, but it's only one person,"" he said by phone, calling Gatineau ""a model of integration."" He said the city's swift action to dissociate itself from Lemieux's comments would limit the damage. ""I don't think it will hurt much,"" he said.

The mayor declined comment on another eye-opening remark from Lemieux, reported this week by Le Droit newspaper.

In an online comment two weeks ago, Lemieux suggested there is a conspiracy to eliminate evidence that the Earth is flat.

""Who decided that the Earth is round, and why should we believe it?"" she asked.

""The first question to ask"" she wrote, ""is now that people realize that it's possible that the Earth is flat, why do they want to hide the explanations that prove it."" She also wondered how much money is diverted to NASA and said she does not believe anything on the news, preferring to conduct her own research.

""The world is a stage and several actors are amusing themselves at our expense thinking they are more intelligent than us,"" she wrote.

Lemieux's assistant confirmed Tuesday that the councillor made the comments, which appeared under a news article about YouTube clamping down on videos promoting conspiracy theories. She said Lemieux was not available for an interview.

The councillor first entered the spotlight last week when she told Le Droit that Islamophobia is a problem invented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The newspaper also quoted her saying, ""These people do a lot of things wrong, with their trucks and all that, it's normal to be scared.""

Pedneaud-Jobin said Lemieux, who was first elected to council in 2017, is a good person who didn't appreciate the impact of her comments about Muslims.

""For me that's what is very serious — to make a connection between Muslims and all terrorists — mixing up things doesn't make sense,"" he said. ""It's dangerous, because it prejudges and makes life difficult for the Muslim community.""

Lemieux was applauding Quebec Premier Francois Legault for his statement last week that there is no Islamophobia in Quebec. After Muslim groups denounced Legault's comments, the premier's office clarified to say Islamophobia exists but there is no culture or current of it in Quebec.

The councillor apologized if anyone was hurt by her comments but remained defiant in a statement on her Facebook page Monday. She said Quebec society is far from being Islamophobic and she remains critical of ""all cultural or religious practices that don't respect human rights, the equality of women and men and the rights of children.""

She said the loss of her deputy mayor title makes her wonder whether freedom of expression is in danger in Gatineau. Later in the day she changed her profile picture to a woman knight in armour with the statement, ""Sometimes you need to remind yourself you're a warrior and warriors don't give up.""",mainstream
1115,"Anti-vaxxers have an 'utter contempt for science' and should be considered on par with flat-Earthers and climate change deniers, an expert has claimed.

Dr Jonathan Kennedy, a lecturer in global health care at Queen Mary University of London, said the anti-vaxx movement is being fuelled by distrust of experts.

The same doubt in public health bodies has fed the flat-Earth and climate change denial movements, he argued.

Dr Kennedy told MailOnline: 'These are small groups of people who have an utter contempt for science.'

His comments come amid a worldwide measles outbreak, as cases this year are already 300 per cent higher than in 2018.

Dr Kennedy argued Britain has the capacity 'to eradicate the virus' completely, if parents only allowed their children to be vaccinated.

Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Kennedy said: 'People are increasingly hostile and suspicious towards experts.

'When we get to vaccines, we're suspicious around experts in this field - doctors advocating vaccines, big-pharma companies and public health bodies.

'People have had enough of ""experts"" - look at the flat Earth movement and climate-change deniers.'

Vaccination rates for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab dropped in 2018 for the fourth consecutive year in the UK.

While the number of children getting immunised declined, measles cases more than trebled last year in England alone.

Official figures show just 91.2 per cent of children in the UK received their first MMR jab by the age of one last year.

The NHS offers the jab to babies as part of their routine vaccination schedule, usually within a month of their first birthday.

Youngsters then have a second injection before they start school, typically at three years and four months.

The World Health Organization (WHO) claims 95 per cent of people need to have the MMR jab for 'herd immunity'.

This occurs when a population is protected against a disease due to a sufficient number of people being vaccinated to prevent it spreading.

Herd immunity protects those who may be unfit to get vaccinated, such as newborns and those undergoing chemotherapy.

But despite MMR's proven benefits, more than 500,000 children in the UK missed out on the jab between 2010 and 2017.

Unicef statistics show that 2.6million Americans, 287,000 Canadians and 138,000 Australians also missed out.

Global measles cases are set to be more than 300 per cent higher this year than in 2018, with 112,000 cases were reported between January and March.

In the same period last year, just 28,124 cases were recorded by the WHO.

Discussing the outbreak, Dr Kennedy told MailOnline: 'It's certainly very concerning.

'It would be very straightforward to eradicate measles from the UK. But parents are refusing to vaccinate their children.'

His comments came about after the UK's Health Secretary Matt Hancock refused to rule out children being kept out of schools if they are not vaccinated against measles.

As of last year, toddlers in France who have not had the necessary jabs, which includes the MMR, are not allowed to attend state schools or nurseries.

There are similar laws in many US states, with 50 of them requiring children have the MMR before they go to kindergarten.

However, vaccination is the choice of the parents in the UK.

Anti-vaxx sentiment has been blamed on false information spread by now-disgraced scientists, including Andrew Wakefield, who alleged the MMR jab causes autism.

The MMR vaccine has been proven to be effective and safe, and has saved thousands of lives since it was introduced in the UK in 1988, according to the NHS.",mainstream
362,"Ethan Lindenberger, a student at Norwalk High School in Norwalk, Ohio, who confided in a now-viral Reddit post that he had not been fully vaccinated due to his mother's belief that vaccines are dangerous.

18-year-old who has advocated for vaccines is now target of harassment

Ethan Lindenberger — the 18-year-old who famously got vaccinated against his mother’s wishes — is in New York City today to speak at a high-level United Nations event on combating vaccine misinformation.

But the recent high school graduate’s planned appearance has sparked an onslaught of harassment by anti-vaccination individuals, who have flooded the phone lines of UNICEF, which is hosting the event.

The Norwalk, Ohio teen — whose mother is staunchly against vaccinations — posted on Reddit in November 2017 asking for advice on how to get up to speed on his immunizations. He ended up getting vaccinated against his mother’s wishes — and in the process, quickly gained prominence as a critic of vaccine misinformation.

In March, Lindenberger testified before the Senate committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions about the threat of false claims being made about vaccines online. He told lawmakers that most of his mother’s flawed information had come from Facebook, which has come under fire for not doing enough to curb health-related inaccuracies on its site.

“I believe she has been so taken advantage of with misinformation online,” he said.

His outspoken advocacy for vaccines has earned him praise from medical professionals and the public health community. But it has also drawn the ire of anti-vaccine individuals, some of whom have harassed him with abusive comments and messages on social media platforms. Some have accused him of being in “Big Pharma’s pocket,” and others have leveled death threats, Lindenberger said. That’s why he wasn’t surprised by the phone calls that inundated the UNICEF office this week — or the hostile nature of some of those calls, he said.

“That’s happened to me for months,” he said. When he testified before the Senate, anti-vaccine protestors rallied outside. Some cornered him by the elevators, he said, and he had to be escorted by Capitol police.

Even in his own hometown, Lindenberger has faced fierce criticism.

“I have friends and family, people who go to my church, who can’t stand what I’m doing,” he said. “When something becomes this polarizing, it becomes very toxic,” he added.

Lindenberger said he tries to separate himself from the attacks that come his way. And though his social media profiles are sometimes overwhelmed with anti-vaccine comments, he tries to engage when he can and sees an opportunity to share accurate information.

“People can be misinformed and so driven and radicalized that it’s almost more sad than it is offensive,” Lindenberger said. “I try to be as respectful of that than I can,” he added.

His speech at the U.N. today comes as the country’s measles count moves toward a quarter-century high. There have been 1,077 cases so far in 2019, according to the CDC.

Lindenberger plans to talk about how social media sites allow dangerous misinformation about vaccines to spread. He’ll also talk about how online anti-vaccine communities can “militarize” to bombard his posts and those of other vaccine advocates with a deluge of hostile comments. Also speaking at the event: Jason Hirsh, head of Facebook’s health policy team, and Gillian Steelfisher, who studies vaccine behaviors and attitudes.

And while Lindenberger continues to champion vaccines and accurate information about them, his mom’s views haven’t changed, he said.

“She believes what I’m doing is dangerous, scary, and misinformed,” he said.",mainstream

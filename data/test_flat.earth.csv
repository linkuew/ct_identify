BARSTOW, Calif. (AP) — A self-styled daredevil died Saturday after a rocket in which he launched himself crashed into the ground, a colleague and a witness said.

“Mad” Mike Hughes died after the homemade rocket crashed on private property near Barstow about 1:52 p.m. near Highway 247, the Daily Press of Victorville reported.

Waldo Stakes, a colleague who was at the rocket launch, said Hughes, 64, was killed.

“It was unsuccessful, and he passed away,” Stakes told The Associated Press. He declined further comment.

Justin Chapman, a freelance journalist, told the AP that he and his wife witnessed the crash.

The rocket appeared to rub against the launch apparatus, which might have torn the parachutes attached to it, Chapman said.

The rocket came straight down into the ground, Chapman said.

According to a San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department statement, deputies were called to the event.

“A man was pronounced deceased after the rocket crashed in the open desert during a rocket launch event,” the statement said. The sheriff’s department did not identify the person who died.

In March 2018, Hughes, who believed the Earth is flat, propelled himself about 1,875 feet into the air before a hard landing in the Mojave Desert.

“My story really is incredible,” Hughes told the AP at the time. “It’s got a bunch of story lines — the garage-built thing. I’m an older guy. It’s out in the middle of nowhere, plus the Flat Earth. The problem is it brings out all the nuts also, people questioning everything. It’s the downside of all this.”",mainstream,M0c4bf,flat.earth
560,"Dressed in stark white spacesuits against the backdrop of a desolate, auburn terrain of stony plains and sand dunes, two scientists test a geo-radar by dragging the flat box across the rocky sand.

Communication from mission command in the Alps is delayed 10 minutes, so when the geo-radar stops working, the two walk back to their all-terrain vehicles and radio colleagues nearby at base camp for guidance.

But this isn't the Red Planet - it's the Arabian Peninsula.

The desolate desert in southern Oman, near the borders of Yemen and Saudi Arabia, resembles Mars so much that more than 200 scientists from 25 nations chose it as their location for the next four weeks, to field-test technology for a manned mission to Mars.

Public and private ventures are racing toward Mars - both former President Barack Obama and SpaceX founder Elon Musk declared humans would walk on the Red Planet in a few decades.

New challengers like China are joining the United States and Russia in space with an ambitious, if vague, Mars program. Aerospace corporations like BlueOrigin have published schematics of future bases, ships and suits.

The successful launch of SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket this week ""puts us in a completely different realm of what we can put into deep space, what we can send to Mars,"" said analog astronaut Kartik Kumar.

The next step to Mars, he says, is to tackle non-engineering problems like medical emergency responses and isolation.

""These are things I think can't be underestimated,"" Kumar said.

While cosmonauts and astronauts are learning valuable spacefaring skills on the International Space Station - and the US is using virtual reality to train scientists - the majority of work to prepare for interplanetary expeditions is being done on Earth.

And where best to field-test equipment and people for the journey to Mars but on some of the planet's most forbidding spots?

Seen from space, the Dhofar Desert is a flat, brown expanse. Few animals or plants survive in the desert expanses of the Arabian Peninsula, where temperatures can top 125 degrees Fahrenheit, or 51 degrees Celsius.

On the eastern edge of a seemingly endless dune is the Oman Mars Base: a giant 2.4-ton inflated habitat surrounded by shipping containers turned into labs and crew quarters.

There are no airlocks.

The desert's surface resembles Mars so much, it's hard to tell the difference, Kumar said, his spacesuit caked in dust. ""But it goes deeper than that: the types of geomorphology, all the structures, the salt domes, the riverbeds, the wadis, it parallels a lot of what we see on Mars.""

The Omani government offered to host the Austrian Space Forum's next Mars simulation during a meeting of the United Nation's Committee On the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.

Gernot Groemer, commander of the Oman Mars simulation and a veteran of 11 science missions on Earth, said the forum quickly accepted.

Scientists from across the world sent ideas for experiments and the mission, named AMADEE-18, quickly grew to 16 scientific experiments, such as testing a ""tumbleweed"" whip-fast robot rover and a new space suit called Aouda.

The cutting-edge spacesuit, weighing about 50 kilograms, is called a ""personal spaceship"" because one can breathe, eat and do hard science inside it. The suit's visor displays maps, communications and sensor data. A blue piece of foam in front of the chin can be used to wipe your nose and mouth.

""No matter who is going to this grandest voyage of our society yet to come, I think a few things we learn here will be actually implemented in those missions,"" Groemer said.

The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of Sputnik ignited a space race between Moscow and Washington to land a crew on the Moon.

But before the U.S. got there first, astronauts like Neil Armstrong trained suspended on pulleys to simulate one-sixth of Earth's gravity.

Hostile environments from Arizona to Siberia were used to fine-tune capsules, landers, rovers and suits - simulating otherworldly dangers to be found beyond Earth. Space agencies call them ""analogues"" because they resemble extraterrestrial extremes of cold and remoteness.

""You can test systems on those locations and see where the breaking points are, and you can see where things start to fail and which design option you need to take in order to assure that it does not fail on Mars,"" said João Lousada, one of the Oman simulation's deputy field commanders who is a flight controller for the International Space Station.

Faux space stations have been built underwater off the coast of Florida, on frigid dark deserts of Antarctica, and in volcanic craters in Hawaii, according to ""Packing For Mars,"" a favourite book among many Mars scientists, written by Mary Roach.

""Terrestrial analogs are a tool in the toolkit of space exploration, but they are not a panacea,"" said Scott Hubbard, known as ""Mars Czar"" back when he lead the US space agency's Mars program. Some simulations have helped developed cameras, rovers, suits and closed-loop life-support systems, he said.

NASA used the Mojave Desert to test rovers destined for the Red Planet but they also discovered much about how humans can adapt.

""Human's adaptability in an unstructured environment is still far, far better than any robot we can send to space,"" Hubbard said, adding that people, not just robots, are the key to exploring Mars.

The European Space Agency's list of ""planetary analogues"" includes projects in Chile, Peru, South Africa, Namibia, Morocco, Italy, Spain, Canada, Antarctica, Russia, China, Australia, India, Germany, Norway, Iceland, and nine US states. Next Thursday, Israeli scientists are to run a shorter simulation in a nature preserve called D Mars.

However, there remain so many unknowns that simulations ""are not in any way a replacement for being there,"" Hubbard said.

""The first person to walk on Mars has in fact already been born, and might be going to elementary school now in Oman, or back in Europe, in the US or China,"" Lousada said.",mainstream,M102dc,flat.earth
599,"YouTube is a supercomputer working to achieve a specific goal — to get you to spend as much time on YouTube as possible.

But no one told its system exactly how to do that. After YouTube built the system that recommends videos to its users, former employees like Guillaume Chaslot, a software engineer in artificial intelligence who worked on the site's recommendation engine in 2010-2011, said he watched as it started pushing users toward conspiracy videos. Chaslot said the platform’s complex “machine learning” system, which uses trial and error combined with statistical analysis to figure out how to get people to watch more videos, figured out that the best way to get people to spend more time on YouTube was to show them videos light on facts but rife with wild speculation.

Routine searches on YouTube can generate quality, personalized recommendations that lead to good information, exciting storytelling from independent voices, and authoritative news sources.

But they can also return recommendations for videos that assert, for example, that the Earth is flat, aliens are underneath Antarctica, and mass shooting survivors are crisis actors.

This isn’t just a YouTube problem. Chaslot’s research on YouTube, which he released earlier this year, added to growing concerns about the pervasiveness of similar algorithms throughout modern society.

“They’re used to give us a credit score, to decide whether you get a job interview, evaluate your college application. They all use algorithms,” said data scientist Cathy O’Neil, author of “Weapons of Math Destruction.”

“All those bureaucratic decision-making systems,” use algorithms, she said, even as part of the criminal sentencing process. Several states are using these computer models to decide lengths of prison time or set bail amounts — which some critics have accused of perpetuating racial bias.

Algorithms trained by human data are now present in the daily lives of billions of people. And 2.2 billion of them are on YouTube.

On the site, the ease with which a person on can be transported from any innocuous search to the lunatic fringe of YouTube is startling. This reporter was helping his son research outer space for his school project. When he searched for ""Saturn,"" the first results were mostly documentaries. One of the recommended videos was ""10 facts you didn't know about space."" That video led to additional recommendations such as ""can you believe it"" videos, a synthesized voice reading Nostradamus predictions and a clip ""they don't want you to see"" of pro-Putin propaganda.

What had started out as a simple search for fun science facts for kindergartners had quickly led to a vast conspiracy ecosystem.

Every day YouTube serves around one billion users who watch billions of hours of video. People use it to search for the latest music videos, learn how to fix their car and write research papers. The site’s videos also make it into Google search results, expanding their reach to potentially billions of searches per day.

YouTube, as one of our primary windows into the world, is shaping our understanding of it. The massive amounts of information available inside has led CEO Susan Wojcicki to call the site a “library.”

And YouTube is just part of it. Google’s search algorithm and Facebook’s News Feed algorithm also serve as filters for information for billions of people.

“There is an infrastructure built since the Renaissance to ensure the integrity of information and knowledge in libraries, many layers of gatekeepers thick,” wrote David Carroll, an associate professor of media design at The New School and a known critic of online platforms, in an email. “YouTube dispenses with all of it in the name of frictionless content acquisition and an algorithm optimized for watch-time to sell ads.”

Chaslot, a software engineer in artificial intelligence, worked on a project to introduce diversity to YouTube’s video recommendations starting in 2010. It didn’t do as well for watch time, he said, so it was shut down and not used.

""This is dangerous because this is an algorithm that's gaslighting people to make them believe that everybody lies to them just for the sake of watch time,"" he said.

He was moved to another group but tried to keep the original project going. According to a YouTube spokesperson, Chaslot was eventually fired in 2013 over performance issues.

Once on the outside, Chaslot said he created a program to analyze how the algorithm was recommending conspiracy videos by using a YouTube account with no viewing history to search for certain topics and collect which videos were recommended to users most.

This means that while “good” or “harmless” videos might be included in the mix of recommendations, YouTube repeatedly invited users to click on certain videos much more than others, essentially giving them free advertising. Chaslot initially shared his research with The Guardian.

His analysis found that when searching for ""Is the Earth flat or round?"" the top recommendation YouTube kept showing users in the beginning of February was ""THE BEST Flat Earth VIDEO | 100% Proof The Earth Is Flat | Please Debunk This I Dare You!!!!” followed by ""Top 10 Reasons People Believe The Earth Is FLAT!"" and ""BEST FLAT EARTH PROOF 2017 - YOU CANT DENY THIS EVIDENCE.""

Searching tragedies can turn up even more disturbing results. If you searched for “Sandy Hook Shooting” in November 2017, one of the top recommended videos was the now removed ""BELIEVE YOUR OWN EYES - 9/11 - 'NO PLANES',"" followed by videos asserting the Connecticut school shooting and its victims were a hoax.

Researchers at Harvard conducted their own test and found that the algorithm was more often drawing viewers to extreme content and unfounded right-wing conspiracy theories.

Experts say the conspiracy videos are perfectly positioned to push our buttons and draw us in to consume more of them — signs that YouTube’s algorithm prioritizes, wrote Robert J. Blaskiewicz Jr., a columnist for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, a non-profit educational organization that applies scientific analysis to conspiracy theory claims, in an email.

""Conspiracy stories hit our emotional fight or flight triggers,” Blaskiewicz wrote. “And the stories rest on the unstated premise that knowledge of the conspiracy will protect you from being manipulated. This in itself compels people to watch and absorb as much as they can and to revisit videos.""

The emotion they provoke is contagious, he said, and they provide ready-made explanations for complex and difficult news events.

YouTube has said it's simply reflecting what users want to see, and videos are chosen based on their individual profile and viewing history.

Publicly, executives have said that the recommendations algorithm drives over 70 percent of content watched on YouTube, and that they’re getting better and better at it all the time.

“Our job is to give the user a steady stream, almost a synthetic or personalized channel,"" YouTube's chief product officer, Neal Mohan, said at CES, the annual consumer tech conference, in Las Vegas in January.

""Higher watch time means more ad inventory,"" said Austin Moldow, an equity researcher at Canaccord Genuity, a financial services firm in New York. ""More ads, more revenue.""

But just because people are willing to watch something doesn’t mean they’re enjoying it. YouTube has to balance protecting its profits with the trust of its users. Fail to walk the line and it can begin to undermine user value, said Kara Swisher, Recode executive editor and MSNBC contributor.

""I think it's a problem not just throughout Youtube, but Google, Facebook, all these companies is that they prioritize growth over anything else. They may not be meaning to do it, but if growth is the goal, then user experience is not the goal,” said Swisher. “Real users, the ones you’re trying to attract, go away. And so it's in all their interests from a business point of view to clean this place up and to have more control over it and there's a moral responsibility to create a platform that isn't being abused by anybody”

“Good advertisers don't wanna be next to these kind of videos either,” she added.

Exploiting the YouTube algorithm is a cottage industry. Video creators who follow the rules can earn a share of advertising revenue. Trends favored by the algorithm are quickly incorporated and uploaded by savvy creators, said Becca Lewis, a researcher at Data & Society, a nonprofit based in New York. Ultimately, if the recommendation engine is promoting conspiracy videos, YouTube incentivizes creating more of them.

But more than just promoting — and prioritizing — misinformation, these digital tabloid channels can also distort democracy. Right before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Chaslot's research found more than 80 percent of the recommended videos favored Donald Trump. Searching ""Trump"" lead to pro-Trump video recommendations. Searching ""Clinton"" raised mainly anti-Clinton video recommendations.

YouTube has taken steps to reduce incentives for some of the worst offenders. Content like mass shootings are not allowed to generate advertising revenue for their creators through YouTube.

However, this doesn’t stop creators from including links for direct donations in their video descriptions, their online merchandise stores, affiliate links for apps or paid mentions within the videos.

In a statement to NBC News, a YouTube spokesperson said “our recommendation system has changed substantially over time and no longer works the way it did five years ago.” While it used to optimize for “watch time,” it now has begun to shift focus to “satisfaction,” balancing watch time with additional data points such as likes, dislikes, shares, and surveys. YouTube has also tweaked its algorithm to better show authoritative news sources, especially for breaking news events, the spokesperson said.

According to YouTube, none of the recommendation system that Chaslot worked on while he was at Google is being used today.

Critics fear that a few updates won’t resolve the core issue, said Tristan Harris, who previously worked as a Google design ethicist and is now a critic of his ex-employer, leading a new group of former technologists out of San Francisco called the Center for Humane Technology.

Using algorithms creates exponential solutions, one for every customer or citizen, but also exponential problems.

“You can't possibly have exponential consequences with exponential responsibility unless you have an exponential amount of human thought to be dedicated to those challenges,” said Harris. “And you can't put that just into an algorithm.”",mainstream,M091ab,flat.earth
1141,"The discovery of the AirAsia airliner’s fuselage in the Java Sea raises new questions about what caused the crash. Possible versions range from misread instruments leading to a stall to a murder-suicide.

AirAsia flight QZ8501 abruptly went off radar on Sunday over the Java Sea shortly after the pilot requested air control in Jakarta for permission to climb higher to avoid a storm. The permission was granted two minutes later, but no response from the crew followed.

The plane disappeared from radar screens three minutes later. No distress call was sent by the plane. Both facts indicated that it fell very quickly, with initial speculation saying that it could have suffered catastrophic destruction in mid-air. But the discovery of the plane’s body lying in one piece on the seabed proved otherwise.

Recovering data from flight and cockpit recorders would be crucial for establishing the truth about the fate of QZ8501, but some flight experts point out that the AirAsia Airbus A320 crash has similarities with another flight incident, that of Air France flight AF447 in 2009.

The plane was officially classed as missing for two years and was found only in 2011. The investigation showed instruments called pitot tubes froze and gave false airspeed readings to the crew. They failed to respond to the problem accordingly and didn’t notice that the plane was about to stall or to try to recover it.

No two accidents are the same. But there are similar conditions like the weather, and we must look into it very closely,” a former air crash investigator in Indonesia told Reuters.

Unlike the AirAsia flight crash, Air France airliner stalled at nighttime when the crew couldn’t see the horizon line and see that the aircraft was losing altitude.

QZ8501 was piloted by an experienced 53-year-old ex-Indonesian Air Force pilot known by the single name Iriyanto, who had 20,000 flying hours under his belt, including 6,100 hours in Airbuses. The co-pilot was Frenchman Remi Plesel with 2,275 flying hours.

AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes expressed confidence in his pilot, saying he was one of the best graduates at his military flight school. The Airbus A320 is a reliable aircraft with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs, according to a safety study published by Boeing in August. With neither human error nor technical failure immediately pinned down as a likely cause, more sinister theories about the crash have arisen.

The plane could have been damaged by a small bomb exploding onboard, John Nance, a former US Air Force pilot, told ABC News.

“Maybe one that wasn’t strong enough to blow the airplane into pieces at altitude, but maybe one that blew the control cables from the hydraulics,” he said.

An even more exotic version would be a deliberate crash by the pilot in a murder-suicide, Nance added. At least three crashes in the past 20 years were caused by this.

One example is SilkAir Flight 185, also from Indonesia, which crashed into a river in southern Sumatra in 1997. Indonesian investigators reported that they couldn’t collect conclusive evidence to rule on the cause of the incident.

But the US National Transportation Safety Board, which participated in the investigation because the aircraft in question was a Boeing 737, said the plane crashed due to deliberate input from the cockpit, most likely by the captain.",conspiracy,C04064,flat.earth

IS EARTH spherical, like a basketball, or flat like the court the game is played on?

Yes, Earth may stand still, but the burden of proof can easily be hoisted onto your opponent’s shoulders.

Element 120, meanwhile, “should be called janskium after Karl Jansky the radio-astronomer, as it would appear directly below radium.” Which would leave us just 10 letters short of an alphabetically complete periodic table, but promisingly, only four short of spelling “ISLAND OF STABILITY”.

289,"This is the second in a two-part series on heaven and hell by Bible scholar Robyn Whitaker. You can read her piece on hell here.

My pious Baptist grandmother once shockingly confessed, at the ripe old age of 93, that she didn’t want to go to heaven. “Why,” we asked? “Well, I think it will be rather boring just sitting around on clouds and singing hymns all day” she answered. She had a point.

Mark Twain might have agreed with her assessment. He once famously quipped that one should choose “heaven for the climate, hell for the company”.

Most of us have some concept of heaven, even if it is one formed by movies like What Dreams May Come, The Lovely Bones, or think it involves meeting Morgan Freeman in a white room. And while not as complicated as biblical ideas about hell, the biblical concept of heaven is not particularly simple either.

In the Christian tradition, heaven and paradise have been conflated as an answer to the question “where do I go when I die?” The idea of the dead being in heaven or enjoying paradise often brings enormous comfort to the bereaved and hope to those suffering or dying. Yet heaven and paradise were originally more about where God lived, not about us or our ultimate destination.

The words for heaven or heavens in both Hebrew (shamayim) and Greek (ouranos) can also be translated as sky. It is not something that exists eternally but rather part of creation.

The first line of the Bible states that heaven is created along with the creation of the earth (Genesis 1). It is primarily God’s dwelling place in the biblical tradition: a parallel realm where everything operates according to God’s will. Heaven is a place of peace, love, community, and worship, where God is surrounded by a heavenly court and other heavenly beings.

Biblical authors imagined the earth as a flat place with Sheol below (the realm of the dead) and a dome over the earth that separates it from the heavens or sky above. Of course, we know the earth is not flat, and this three-tiered universe makes no sense to a modern mind. Even so, the concept of heaven (wherever it is located) continues in Christian theology as the place where God dwells and a theological claim that this world is not all that there is.

The other main metaphor for God’s dwelling place in the Bible is paradise. According to Luke’s version of the crucifixion, Jesus converses with the men on either side of him while waiting to die and promises the man on a neighbouring cross “today you will be with me in paradise”.

References to paradise in the Bible are likely due to the influence of Persian culture and particularly Persian Royal gardens (paridaida). Persian walled gardens were known for their beautiful layout, diversity of plant life, walled enclosures, and being a place where the royal family might safely walk. They were effectively a paradise on earth.

The garden of Eden in Genesis 2 is strikingly similar to a Persian Royal garden or paradise. It has abundant water sources in the rivers that run through it, fruit and plants of every kind for food, and it is “pleasing to the eye”. God dwells there, or at least visits, and talks with Adam and Eve like a King might in a royal garden.

In the grand mythic stories that make up the Bible, humans are thrown out of Eden due to their disobedience. And so begins a narrative about human separation from the divine and how humans find their way back to God and God’s dwelling (paradise). In the Christian tradition, Jesus is the means of return.

The Easter event that Christians celebrate around the globe at this time of year is about the resurrection of Jesus after his violent death on the cross three days earlier. Jesus’ resurrection is seen as the promise, the “first-fruits” of what is possible for all humans – resurrection to an eternal life with God. This is, of course, a matter of faith not something that can be proven. But reconciliation with God lies at the heart of the Easter story.

The last book of the Bible, Revelation, conflates the idea of heaven and paradise. The author describes a vision of a new, re-created heaven coming down to earth. It is not escapism from this planet but rather an affirmation of all that is created, material, and earthly but now healed and renewed.

This final biblical vision of heaven is a lot like the garden of Eden – complete with the Tree of Life, rivers, plants and God – although this time it is also an urban, multicultural city. In what is essentially a return to Eden, humans are reconciled with God and, of course, with one another.

Heaven or paradise in the Bible is a utopian vision, designed not only to inspire faith in God but also in the hope that people might embody the values of love and reconciliation in this world.",mainstream,M0ab6b,flat.earth
721,"A new study of the Milky Way shows that our home galaxy is significantly warped. Instead of forming a relatively flat disk, the hundreds of billions of stars that make up the Milky Way form a disk that's noticeably twisted at the edges, a bit like a flattened letter ""S.""

""I'd say that it is shaped like a Pringle,"" said study co-author Radek Poleski, an astronomer at Ohio State University in Columbus.

For decades, astronomers assumed that the Milky Way was relatively flat, like most other spiral galaxies (the Milky Way is a so-called barred spiral galaxy, a whirlpool of stars and interstellar clouds with a bright bar across the middle). The new research, which was published Aug. 2 in the journal Science, confirms recent research showing that the galaxy is warped but also shows that the distortion is more pronounced than astronomers had suspected.

The Milky Way is estimated to have a diameter of just over 100,000 light-years, and our solar system is embedded within it about 25,000 light-years from the galaxy's center. So it's hard to see the bend from our vantage point — and vast clouds of interstellar gas and dust within the galaxy make the task even harder, Poleski said.

But Poleski and astronomers at the University of Warsaw in Poland created a new super-detailed map of the Milky Way using so-called variable stars known as classical Cepheids, which brighten and dim over a period of days at a rate corresponding to their size. At their brightest, classical Cepheids can be 10,000 brighter than our sun, so they're visible across vast distances and through the clouds of gas and dust.

Using observational data from the Optical Gravitational Lens Experiment (OGLE), an ongoing survey of stars in the southern sky made using a specialized telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert, the astronomers determined accurate positions for more than 2,400 classical Cepheid stars by comparing the light they were known to produce with the light from them seen here on Earth.

""When we measure the period of a star, we know how much absolute light it emits,"" Poleski said. ""Then we can compare it with the light that we are getting, and by comparing those two we get the distance.""

What explains our galaxy's weird shape? Richard de Grijs, an astronomer at MacQuarrie University in Sydney, Australia, attributed it to the effects of gravitational interactions with neighboring galaxies.

It's also possible that our galaxy twisted as it merged with smaller galaxies in the distant past, he said, or that its warped shape is the result of the combined gravity of the spiral arms themselves, which could pull stars and clouds at the edges away from the flat plane of the rest of the galaxy.

De Grijs, who was part of a team who measured the galaxy's bend in research published earlier this year, said the new study confirmed and expanded upon the earlier research. ""They found pretty much the same result, which is comforting,"" he told NBC News MACH in an email.

The researchers plan to refine their model of the galaxy with help from telescopes that can see stars in the northern sky.

435,"""Lights All Askew in the Heavens,"" proclaimed a headline in the New York Times on Nov. 10, 1919. The reason: results had just come in from the very first test of Albert Einstein's new general theory of relativity. ""Men of Science More or Less Agog over Results of Eclipse Observations,"" the headline continued, in what passed for breathless excitement back then.

The key theory that had the scientists so giddy was Einstein's claim that space and time were elastic, and could be warped and stretched like taffy. The test that proved it involved observing stars whose position in the sky makes them appear to be close to the sun and measuring whether solar gravity warped space-time enough to distort the starlight slightly. A 1919 solar eclipse allowed scientists to see the stars clearly and make the necessary measurements  proving that the great man's theories were correct.

You might think that when a scientific finding hasn't been seriously challenged for 93 years the matter would be pretty much settled, but experimentalists have been poking and prodding Einstein's premises ever since. There's more than just stubborn skepticism at work: some of relativity's more esoteric implications are fiendishly hard to confirm, so the physicists keep devising more and more sensitive and difficult studies  even though the theory keeps passing them all.

Which explains a recent announcement out of NASA headquarters. After no fewer than seven cancellations, followed by seven reprieves, the space agency's orbiting Gravity Probe B mission, or GP-B for short, has at last confirmed not one, but two of relativity's more subtle predictions  and it took only 51 years and three-quarters of a billion dollars to do it.

To understand what the probe found, you first need to know about space-time, the four-dimensional stage on which everything in the universe plays out. What we think of as gravity, Einstein said, isn't a force that pulls two objects toward each other. Rather, it's a warping of space-time itself that makes objects want to move. The classic real-world analogy is a bowling ball on a trampoline: the ball makes the trampoline's surface dip. That's something vaguely like the way a star or a planet makes space-time warp. The big difference is that space-time isn't a flat surface, but something that fills the universe. This makes the warping pretty much impossible to visualize, even for physicists, so don't try. In any case, if you roll a marble close to the bowling ball, it will naturally fall into the depression  just as a passing meteorite falls to Earth.

That's part one. Part two is that since the bowling ball represents Earth, it isn't just sitting but spinning, which makes the surface of the trampoline twist a little in the direction of the spin. The same goes for the space-time surrounding our spinning planet. What GP-B did was to measure both the dip and the twist.

The spacecraft managed that impressive feat by carrying four of the most perfect gyroscopes ever built  actually, they're superconducting balls of niobium  into orbit around planet Earth while the ship itself pointed unerringly at the star IM Pegasi for 17 months, starting in 2004. The balls, meanwhile, floated independently inside, supported only by magnetic fields. If the gyroscopes kept the same orientation as the spacecraft that bore them, Einstein would have been refuted. But they wandered a bit, meaning the satellite was flying through gently twisted space. Relativity had come through once again.

It took years to figure that out, though, because the experiment turned out to be flawed. Patches of electric charge had built up on the surface of the balls, adding an extra force that proved extremely tricky to unravel. And even when the physicists had done so, they found they could measure the dip in space-time only to an accuracy of 1%, and the twist, formally known as frame dragging, to a flabby 19%. In the half-century since GP-B was first proposed, moreover, other physicists have confirmed both effects.

""I have to compliment the Gravity Probe B team for their result because Gravity Probe B is a very difficult and very beautiful experiment,"" the Italian physicist Ignazio Ciufolini told the website ScienceNOW. He was clearly being polite, considering that his own LAGEOS satellite measured frame dragging with higher precision a few years ago.

LAGEOS and the other experiments that yielded similar findings weren't necessarily cheap, but they didn't cost $750 million either  a price that even NASA was finally unable to afford. It backed away from funding the last stages of the project, relying on a Saudi scientist to kick in the final few million.

So was Gravity Probe B worth it? To hear GP-B scientists tell it, the experiment was a resounding success. But in order to justify that judgment in the face of the high cost, slow progress and imprecise results, they knew they couldn't simply invoke Einstein. Instead, they also felt the need to point out that people who had worked on GP-B as grad students had gone on to do important things (Sally Ride became the first American woman in space!), and that the technology developed for GP-B had widespread applications  including, believe it or not, GPS systems that now help farmers plant very straight rows of corn.

For anyone familiar with the NASA press office, this isn't a huge vote of confidence. If you need agriculture to justify a fundamental physics experiment, you're clearly feeling a little desperate. And with sharply declining budgets, better corn rows won't likely persuade the agency to spring for more big-ticket tests of general relativity.

But money for such studies didn't seem to be forthcoming anyway. Just last month, NASA announced it was backing out of a proposed space mission called the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, designed to look for gravitational waves  yet another of relativity's strange predictions. It may be a while, in other words, before men of science  and the women who long since broke into that once exclusive club  get to be more or less agog again.

1306,"oseph Sobran, with whom I almost always agree, recently wrote a column on the absence of any real contemporary anti-war movement. In it, he cited three differences between 2005 and 1968.
• Todays 18-21 year olds are not worried about being drafted.
• The opposition to this war that does exist is not part of any larger cultural change.

Now, we hear that the Army and Marine Corps are having trouble meeting their recruiting goals. We are witnessing an anti-war movement of a different type.

I cannot remember either of the parties to this story, but I will tell it anyway. Someone once said of a famous philosopher, that he loved humanity, but he hated people. He cared deeply about humanity in the abstract, but he was frustrated unmercifully by the unwillingness of people to behave in accordance with his ideals. Oh, if it werent for those pesky, inconvenient people!

We Americans love to talk about war. Many of us cheerlead for perpetual war. We stand behind our president and our troops. We brand anyone who criticizes our military policies as liberal, communist, pro-terror and a lover of al-Qaeda. We always speak in the first person when promoting war. (We ought to bomb the crap out of this country and we ought to pulverize that country!)

But we never want to talk about what actually happens in war. For a refresher, let me recommend the first 20 minutes of . Talking to one segment of America about war is like talking to another segment of America about abortion.

Heaven forbid that we actually go fight it ourselves. We deride John Kerry, Ted Kennedy and other limousine liberals for not parting with their wealth while they tax the rest of us into poverty. Yet, many of the most vocal war hawks in the executive branch, in congress and in the media have never lifted a finger to serve one day in the military. The same goes for many of these same war hawks at work, at church and in your neighborhood.

I cannot speak for people half my age. However, I am going to put myself in the shoes of a 19-year-old looking at his options, with the military being one of them.

Iraq never attacked us. They never threatened to attack us. If they had attacked us we would have whipped them good. They never had the means to do so anyway. There were no WMDs. We got Saddam. They have had their election. And now, they are so busy fighting among themselves that they arent about to attack anyone.

Why are we even over there? If some other country comes and invades, then I will go fight. Gladly! But, I am not going to risk my life in Iraq.

He speaks for the anti-war movement of 2005. Youll note no social commentary here. No ulterior motives. He just is not willing to be meat on the hoof when he sees no threat to himself or his country. Who can blame him?

In 1993, someone told Hillary Clinton that the costs imposed by her husbands national health care proposal could put a lot of small business out of business. She responded that it was not (her) job to go out and save every undercapitalized businessman in America. Conservative commentators rightfully compared her arrogance to that of Marie Antoinette.

When someone asked Vice President Cheney why he never served in the military, he answered, I had other priorities. These same commentators ought to be similarly indignant about his arrogance.

There is a black wall in Washington, DC, with 58,000 names on it. Many of these people had other priorities as well.

War is easy to talk about and easy to be self-righteous about. However, it has consequences.

This isnt the hood. This is not the South Bronx, South Central Los Angeles or Five Points here in Denver. This is WAR!!! To quote the Talking Heads, ""This ain't no party. This ain't no disco. This ain't no fooling around.""

Chuck Baldwin, another one of my internet punditry faves, recently wrote eloquently of the scourge of war:

To those who are engaged in war, the consequences can be nightmarish! Arms and legs cut off. Eyes put out. Flesh burned. Intestines ripped out. Backs broken. Skulls crushed. Lives lost. Families torn apart. Homes destroyed. Children left without parents. Parents never able to see their children again. Wives without husbands. Husbands without wives. Souls snuffed into eternity. Emotional scars that never heal. These are the realities of war. And this is what the neo-cons who profit from war never have to see up close and personal.

Instead, pro-war neo-cons sit in their comfortable, air-conditioned offices and send other husbands, other wives, other parents, other children, other people to incur the ""scourge"" of war. But the neo-cons who trumpet war, who promote war, and who finance war never actually experience war. 

This is America. You can have whatever opinion you want. If you want to believe the earth is flat or worship Mungabunga, go ahead. However, it does not mean your opinion has any worth.

You can support perpetual war all you want, but if you yourself have never served, your opinion is of no interest to me. If you feel threatened by some fourth-rate, tin pot, Third World potentate, fight him yourself.

The late Pat Tillman gave up a pro football career to become and Army Ranger. Colorado State Treasurer Mike Coffman, a retired Marine reservist, took a leave of absence to rejoin the Corps in Iraq. So why dont you drop what youre doing, head to Baghdad and bust a few caps? Yeah you, Rambo!

The War of Northern Aggression (1861-1865) was once ridiculed as a rich mans war and a poor mans fight. It was easy to talk about it, but hard to find people to fight it. Indeed, the worst riots in American history were the 1863 anti-draft riots in New York City.

Before you whine about France not joining us in Iraq and before you say a word about the need for a draft, do it yourself! Why is it wimping out"" only when

Ill say one thing about the draft dodgers in Vietnam: they had the courage to act on their convictions. Ill say one thing and one thing only on behalf of John Kerry: he was in harms way for four and a half months during Nam.

I know a great place where the military can find tons and tons of fresh meat to be ground pounders in whatever war is next. They need to put recruiters in the evangelical churches in this country and see how many folks actually enlist. Each Sunday, they could set up tables in the lobby. The pastors shouldnt have a problem with this.

Come on, now! Raise your hand! Swear that oath! Sign that paper! Ship out and destroy some country in order to save it. Its your Christian duty! Dude, this is a jihad for Jesus. I think it is based on the book of Jebediah or Pauls letter to the Estonians.

If you are too old, or for some other reason not qualified to join the military, form your own expeditionary force. Call it the Sword of the Lord. There are precedents of Americans volunteering to fight in other countries for causes they support.

It is easy to talk about your Great Christian President and to praise his wars as doing Gods work around the globe. It is easy to have a yellow ribbon and a W04 bumper sticker on your car. It is, as they say, a whole nother thing to support his policies by participating in them.

This rare astronomical event only occurs when a full moon is closest to Earth in its orbit, often appearing larger and brighter than usual.

610,"Though there was no obstinate mechanical shark to contend with, Close Encounters was an arduous picture to make. It was shot during a five-month period in early 1976 and took more than a year to edit. The locations—several of them deserts—spread from California to India; the launching-pad set in Mobile, Ala., used in the film's climax is six times as large as Hollywood's biggest sound stage, Spielberg ""was forever screwing up schedules like a whirlwind,"" says Melinda Dillon, the film's female lead, recalling the strain. ""He worked all night, every night—catching a few hours' sleep when he could. He had his Winnebago trailer set up to screen films, and he was always running 2001, and when he got tired of that, he would run cartoons."" null Truffaut, the French director whom Spielberg persuaded to act in the film, was also dazzled by Spielberg's stamina—though he was somewhat baffled by the movie itself. ""I never really tried to figure out what my role meant,"" he says. ""I know I was there a lot, but like Greta Garbo, I can say only that I had the feeling of waiting.""

There were a few incidents of unexpected—and largely unwanted—excitement. Star Richard Dreyfuss, after criticizing the Ku Klux Klan in an Alabama newspaper interview, received a death threat and had to be whisked away for two weeks. Dillon's son received a kidnaping threat that brought in the FBI. Then, late one night, shooting halted abruptly so that everyone could observe what Spielberg believed to be a UFO cruising the sky. ""Everyone was lying there on their backs with binoculars,"" says Dillon. ""I remember thinking that if there were extraterrestrial beings up there observing us, they would think that earth creatures were flat beings with strange eyes."" The object turned out to be an Echo satellite.

Despite Spielberg's preoccupation with UFOs in Close Encounters, he prefers to call the film an ""adventure thriller"" rather than science fiction, and he may have a point. The movie's conception is pure Hitchcock—on an intergalactic scale. The hero, Roy Neary (Dreyfuss), is a Middle American variant on the kind of man-in-the-middle played by Gary Grant and James Stewart in films like North by Northwest and Vertigo. A power-company worker who lives with his wife (Teri Garr) and three kids in Muncie, Ind., Roy is engulfed one night by phenomena he cannot understand: searing lights burn him from above, a road sign shakes and twists, the contents of his truck move about in violent defiance of gravity, the needles on his dashboard dials spin past go. Roy is sure that he has had an encounter

with alien life forms—but, of course, no one will believe his story. The rest of Close Encounters' plot follows Roy and several other UFO sighters, including a mysterious international scientist (Truffaut) and a neighborhood woman (Dillon), as they overturn their lives in a mad attempt to arrange a rendezvous with the extraterrestrial visitors. When an earthling makes actual contact with aliens, that is ""a close encounter of the third kind."" (The first kind is sighting; the second, physical evidence.)",mainstream,M0f168,flat.earth
233,"""For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."" —James 2:10 Who's the biggest sinner? I am! You are! We all are! WE HAVE SINNED! Put down your stones you self-righteous hypocrites! It is human nature to look upon the sins and faults of others, while often overlooking our own sins. This is hypocrisy. One of the worst deceptions is overlooking our own faults. The Word of God proclaims in James 2:10 that committing even ONE SIN makes a person GUILTY in God's eyes of breaking every command in the Bible. James 2:10, “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.” This is a startling doctrine that is hardly touched upon in churches today. If you are a Christian the whole world is waiting for you to fall. Sermon uploads that would change lives are fortunate to receive even a hundred hits, but you upload some juicy gossip about a preacher sinning and millions of people want to know it. This evidences the hypocrisy and desperate wickedness of the human heart, just as Jeremiah 17:9 says, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?” If you are truly right with God, then you see yourself as the biggest sinner, because you know yourself better than anyone. Do you know what a hypocrite is Biblically? It is a person who thinks that someone else is a bigger sinner than them self. Here is a precious MP3 sermon by Pastor Jack Hyles titled, “Chief Of Sinners.” No real Christian claims to be less a sinner than others! There is no teaching in the Bible that says Christians are less sinful than unsaved people. The only difference is that we as believers have the Holy Spirit indwelling our bodies. As separated Christians, we must never accept the sin with the sinner, nor should we ever reject the sinner with the sin. We ought to love everybody with God's unconditional love through the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Did you know that the divorce rate amongst professed Christians is equal to that of the heathen unsaved world? This is because Christians think the same way as the heathen world. Romans 12:2 exhorts Christians not to be conformed, that is, fashioned, according to this present world. Divorce is always worldly, never Christian. In filing for divorce, a person is saying: “My spouse is a bigger sinner than I am; therefore, I have a right to abandon, quit and break my marriage vows.” No you don't! Divorce is a horrible sin rooted in one's own hypocritical self-righteousness. The Bible teaches that we are all as guilty as the vilest sinner in God's eyes. This doctrine is virtually unheard of nowadays, because few preachers stress the Law of God anymore, which condemns all of us as guilty sinners before God... Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God ” (Romans 3:19). In the eyes of men, murdering someone is obviously worse than stealing their lunch; but as far as God is concerned we are all equally lacking any righteousness of our own. We are each as dirty and rotten as the other guy. Oftentimes what people perceive as acceptable, such as homosexuality, is an abomination unto God. If we SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES as Jesus commanded in John 5:39, then we can only come to the conclusion that we are as sinful as the worst sinner in God's eyes and it matters not who is more guilty. We are all guilty (Romans 3:10,23). The fact of the matter is that we are all sinners deserving of punishment in Hell (Romans 6:23; Revelation 20:11-15). Although we may never commit murder or rob a bank, that does make us any less guilty of being a horrible sinner in the eyes of God. “If we could ever hate the sin in ourselves as much as we hate the sin in others, we might have some idea what His Book is all about.” 

 —Pastor Jack Hyles (a quote from page 322 of the awesome biography of Dr. Hyles titled, “The Fundamental Man”) May I say, no matter how righteous I may try to live, the ONLY reason why I will ever be righteous is because of the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ. Jesus paid my sin debt, and He alone is my righteousness. I have no righteousness to offer God, and neither do you. People tend to selfishly judge themselves based upon what sins they personally DON'T commit. Did you understand that? People who don't commit adultery are quick to condemn others who commit adultery, because that's not their sin. But perhaps they are a thief for a living, and so they are silent when it comes to the sin of theft. This is how shallow, wicked and hypocritical most people are. The Bible perfectly illustrates this in Jesus' account of the Pharisee and the publican who went up to the temple to pray... “Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted” (Luke 18:10-14). The Pharisee in Luke 18:10-14 made the grave mistake of comparing himself with other people, instead of measuring himself up against the holy Law of God. If we foolishly look at other people who commit the sins that we don't, or sins that we perceive as being worse than our sins, then we naturally become self-righteousness and think we are “better” than others. I tell you, you are as filthy and rotten as Adolf Hitler in God's eyes, and so am I... “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away” (Isaiah 64:6). Reproach For Sins Comes Now Or Later The Bible teaches that some people's sins are open (known) beforehand here on earth. But the Bible teaches that everyone else's sins will follow them and be revealed in eternity, causing shame and reproach... 5:24, “Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.” When the truth is known, ALL PEOPLE will be exposed as wicked and shameful sinners. When asked to give the name of the worst and most horrible sinners we know, most people tend to think of people besides them self. This is the hypocritical nature of humanity. This is why all gossip is sinful and wrong, that is, because we are just as sinful as the person that we criticize. Hey, let's talk about our selves instead. All of a sudden no one has anything to say? Perhaps we have never commit a particular sin per se, but we ought not to judge others simply because they sin differently than we do. Mankind is inherently sinful and has NO self-righteousness to offer God. Even committing one sin is enough to be damned to the Lake of Fire forever (Revelation 20:11-15). That's the reason why God sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross of Calvary, shedding His precious blood to pay for our sins. God's Law indicts all humanity as guilty sinners (Romans 3:19). 1st Timothy 5:24 says that some men's sins are open to criticism and judgment beforehand, but everyone else's sins will be made known eventually on judgment day. NO ONE is going to retain their dignity and honor on judgment day as a self-righteous person who didn't do anything shameful, disgraceful or surprising. The Bible declares that ALL men have come short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). The Bible teaches that the Pharisees who condemned others were the guiltiest of all sinners (Matthew 7:1-5). The reason why hypocrites throw rocks at others is because they are proud, arrogant and saturated with sins them self. Those hypocrites who condemn others for their sins will one day be silenced completely in eternity when THEIR SINS are revealed. Christians who realize their own sinfulness DON'T condemn other people when they sin. Slanderers and critics of sinners are self-righteous, FAILING to see their own depth of sin and evil. Most people have absolutely no idea how sinful they really are in comparison to the holy Bible. You and I are dirty, rotten, guilty, sinners in God's eyes. Therefore, we had all better think twice before we decide to throw rocks at other people who sin, denouncing them as evil, and taking delight in their calamity. Our day of reckoning is also coming! So before you look down in disdain upon someone else who has sinned horribly, you had better consider your own horrible sins in God's eyes, because the Lord will judge us according to how we judge others... Matthew 7:1-3, “Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? ” Even the best Christians still have a mote (tiny piece) in their eye, meaning that we are all sinners; but those evil critics who spread gossip, tell tales, condemn others, reveal secrets and hypocritically destroy their neighbor with their mouth have a beam (large piece) in their eye. God's harshest judgment is reserved for those arrogant sinners who condemn other sinners, overlooking their own wickedness in hypocrisy while trying to destroy the good name of others. If the truth be known, we all have a skeleton closet of sins. The Bible says that a person is calling God a liar if they deny their sinfulness (1st John 1:8,10). We are living in an evil generation that tolerates all manner of sin and wickedness from Hollywood, rock music stars, and their favorite immoral professional athletes; yet, the world is waiting for every Christian to fall flat. Jesus taught in John 15:19 not to marvel if the world hates us as Christians, because the world hated Him first. 2nd Timothy 3:12 foretold that those faithful Christians who live godly in Christ Jesus SHALL SUFFER PERSECUTION. The world hates the Bible and Christians who uphold the truths of the Bible. 

 Would to God that Christians in churches today would stop saying, “he has sinned,” and “she has sinned,” and that we'd all start saying, “we have sinned.” It is sinful pride that causes a wife to publicly criticize or divorce her husband. It is sinful pride that causes the manure-spreading newsmedia to mercilessly destroy people's lives. It is sinful pride that causes children to broadcast their parent's dirty laundry to others. It is sinful pride that causes self-righteous hypocrites to meddle in other people's marriages. I came to the realization one day as a believer that I am as rotten and sinful as the worst sinner. I am just as sinful as any adulterer, mass-murderer, homosexual, thief, liar or Satan worshipper. AND SO ARE YOU! Our sins are just as woeful and wrong. We have no room to condemn. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief ” (1st Timothy 1:15). The Apostle Paul was a faithful missionary who loved the Lord Jesus Christ and helped people everywhere he went. Paul suffered horribly from shipwreck, hunger, turmoil and malicious beatings from his enemies; yet he kept going for God. Paul was a mighty preacher and a strong Christian. Although Paul was arguably the greatest missionary who ever lived, he still addressed himself as the “chief of sinners.” I don't know too many believers today who are anywhere near as dedicated and committed to Jesus Christ as was Paul. If a good Christian like Paul esteemed himself as the “chief of sinners,” then we ought to feel the same way. 

 We must distinguish between condemning someone for their sins versus publicly exposing them because they are a threat to society. I publicly expose abortionists (murderers), homosexuals (sex perverts) and religious deceivers (liars) through my online ministry; but I do not condemn any of them personally. I am not condemning them; God's Word condemns all of us (Romans 3:19-23). I am as rotten and sinful as the worst sinner. I am not self-righteous; I am trusting upon HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, i.e., the righteousness of Jesus Christ (2nd Corinthians 5:21). I deserve to burn in Hell and there's absolutely nothing good about me except the Lord Jesus Christ Who lives in my heart, thankfully. If a local school has a teacher who is teaching teens how to have homosexual “fist sex,” which is happening today in Massachusetts, then that evil person needs to be exposed. Godless heathens are quick to cry out, “Jesus said, 'judge not lest ye be not judged.' ” They conveniently fail to quote John 7:24 where Jesus stated, “Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.” So we are supposed to judge, but rightfully so. Ephesians 5:10-11 reads, “Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.” The word “proving” in Ephesians 5:10 is the Greek word (dokimazo) and means “to test.” Thus, God wants us to test everything, to judge righteously, to discern whether or not something is acceptable to Him, i.e., in agreement with His holy Word. Certainly, it is NOT acceptable to teach children that it's ok for Timmy to stick his fist in Johnny's backside as an expression of love. We are living in a sicko society in America. Ephesians 5:11 commands God-fearing believers to reprove [Greek: elencho, i.e., “to expose”] all works of darkness. This is not condemning; but rather, judging righteously as we are supposed to do. Would to God that more believers today would realize the extent of their wickedness in the eyes of God. We are a sorry bunch. Our only hope is the precious Lord Jesus Christ and the salvation that He freely offers to us, paid for by His own shed blood... Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot” (1st Peter 1:18,19). If it weren't for the literal precious blood of Jesus Christ, we'd all be doomed to the Lake of Fire. God is a good God... “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us One day I had preached a rip-snortin', shingle-pullin', window-rattlin', hell-fire and damnation sermon to a group of about 80 people in Chicago. After the sermon I stepped outside for some fresh air. I glanced over and noticed a gentleman smoking. He felt embarrassed and said, “I'm sorry reverend for smoking in front of you. I replied, “I preach against sin from the pulpit; but away from the pulpit I'm just as much a sinner as anyone else. You're in good company friend. You need not apologize.

1142,"Open-circuit faults may be caused by the failure of joints on cables or overhead lines or the failure of all the three phases of a circuit-breaker or disconnector to open or close. For example, during a closing operation, two phases of a circuit-breaker may close and latch successfully but not the third phase, or, during an opening operation, two phases may properly open but the third remains stuck in the closed position. Except on mainly underground systems, the vast majority of short-circuit faults are weather-related, followed by equipment failure. The weather factors that usually cause short-circuit faults are: lightning strikes, accumulation of snow or ice, heavy rain, strong winds or gales, salt pollution depositing on insulators on overhead lines and in substations, floods and fires adjacent to electrical equipment, for example, beneath overhead lines. Vandalism may also be a cause of short-circuit faults as well as contact with or breach of minimum clearances between overhead lines and trees due to current overload.

Lightning strikes discharge steep-fronted impulse currents with peak values in the range of a few kiloamps up to 100 or 200 kA for a duration of several microseconds. If the strike hits an overhead line or its earth wire, the voltage produced across the insulator may be so large that a back-flashover and short circuit occurs. This may involve one or all three phases of a three-phase electrical circuit and as a result a transient power frequency short-circuit current flows.

For example, consider a 132-kV three-phase overhead transmission line of steel tower construction and one earth wire. The surge impedances of the tower, line phase conductors and earth wire are given as 220, 350 and 400 Ω, respectively, and the tower’s earthing or footing resistance is 50 Ω. The line’s rated lightning impulse withstand voltage to earth is 650 kV peak phase to earth (nominal peak phase to earth voltage is ). A lightning strike with a modest peak current of 10 kA hits a tower on the line and, to a reasonable approximation, ‘sees’ half the surge impedance of the earth wire in parallel with the surge impedance of the tower. The voltage produced across the line’s insulator is approximately equal to 10 kA×105 Ω=1050 kV. This significantly exceeds the line’s insulation strength, causes back-flashover on all three phases of the line and a three-phase to earth short-circuit fault. If the shielding of the earth wire fails and the lightning strike hits one of the phase conductors near a tower, then the voltage produced across the line’s insulator is approximately equal to 10 kA×175 Ω=1750 kV. In this case, a smaller lightning current in the order of 3.8 kA would be sufficient to cause a back-flashover and hence a short-circuit fault.

On lower-voltage distribution lines, even ‘indirect’ lightning strikes, that is, those that hit nearby objects to the line may produce a sufficiently large voltage on the line to cause an insulator flashover and a short-circuit fault. Other causes of short-circuit faults are fires. The smoke of fires beneath overhead lines consists of small particles which encourage the breakdown of the air that is subjected to the intense electric field of a high-voltage power line. The hot air in the flames of a fire has a much lower insulation strength than air at ambient temperature. A flashover across an insulator to earth or from a phase conductor to a tree may occur.

Equipment failure of machines, transformers, reactors, cables, etc., causes many short-circuit faults. These may be caused by failure of internal insulation due to ageing and degradation, breakdown due to high switching or lightning over-voltages, by mechanical incidents or by inappropriate installation. An example is a breakdown of a cable’s polymer insulation due to ageing or the creation of voids within the insulation caused by an external mechanical force being accidentally applied on the cable.

Short-circuit faults may also be caused by human error. A classical example is one where maintenance staff inadvertently leave isolated equipment connected through safety earth clamps when maintenance work is completed. A three-phase to earth short-circuit fault occurs when the equipment is re-energised to return it to service.

On mainly overhead line systems, the majority of short-circuit faults, typically 80%–90%, tend to occur on overhead lines and the rest on cables, substation equipment and busbars combined. Typically, on a high-voltage transmission system with overhead line steel tower construction, such as the England and Wales transmission system, long-term average short-circuit fault statistics show that around 300 short-circuit faults occur per annum. Of these, 67% are one-phase to earth, 25% are phase to phase, 5% are three-phase to earth and three-phase clear of earth, and 3% are two-phase to earth. About 77% of one-phase to earth faults are caused by lightning strikes followed by wind and gales then salt pollution on insulators. Although lightning can cause some phase-to-phase faults, by far the most common causes of these faults are snow/ice followed by wind/gales that cause two line conductors to clash. The majority of three-phase to earth and two-phase to earth faults in England and Wales are caused by lightning then wind and gales. On wood-pole overhead lines, for example, some 132 kV and lower voltages in England and Wales, between 50% and 67% of short-circuit faults are two-phase and three-phase faults.",mainstream,M0fa77,flat.earth
291,"MYTH: The moon's gravity pulling on water causes the tides.

This is only partly true.

The moon does pull on ocean water, but that tug at any one point is about 10 million times weaker than Earth's gravity. It's really the interplay of gravity between the moon, Earth, and sun that creates a tidal force, and it's more of a ""push"" than a ""pull.""

Each molecule of water is pulled by the moon's gravity, but alone that acceleration is so weak it isn't noticeable. Because ocean water covers about 71% of Earth's surface and is connected as one liquid body, however, all of those tiny tugs add up to form a significant pressure — the tidal force.

Molecules of water near the poles are pulled mostly straight down, those on the face of Earth closest to the moon experience the strongest pull toward the moon, and those on the opposite side of Earth feel the weakest acceleration.

Together, these interactions form a pressure on seawater that generally directs it away from the poles and toward the equator, where it's strong enough to fight gravity to form two bulges: the high tides.

Tides follow the moon as it orbits Earth every 28 days, but it's not as simple as that. Water sloshes around, just as it does within in aquarium, and the shape of the seafloor, the position of the coasts, and the Coriolis effect (caused by Earth's rotation) affect where and to what extent tides occur — resulting in a complex pattern of ""tidal nodes.""

""Earth rotates so quickly that the tide water wave can't move around the Earth quickly enough,"" Ted Swift, an environmental scientist who works for the state of California, told Business Insider in an email. ""What we see as tides on the coast are resonances — rotating standing waves — set up by the fundamental tidal potential 'signal.'""

Smaller bodies of water, like lakes and pools, don't have noticeable tides because they lack enough liquid to create a pressure that can visibly overcome the pull of Earth's gravity.

The sun's gravity also affects the tides, accounting for roughly one-third of the phenomenon. When the sun's gravity counteracts the moon's, it leads to lower-than-average ""neap tides."" When the sun lines up with the moon, it triggers larger ""spring tides.""

Correction: An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the nature of tides.",mainstream,M0ef89,flat.earth
339,"China has launched a probe destined to become the first rover to land on the far side of the moon, state media reported on Saturday.

Xinhua news agency reported that a Long March 3B rocket carrying the Chang'e-4 lunar probe took off from the country's southwestern Xichang launch center at 2:23 a.m. local time (1823 UTC).

The rover is scheduled to land on the moon and begin conducting experiments and survey work by the end of December. The experiments, six of which are Chinese, include analyzing minerals and measuring radiation.

The synchronicity of the earth and moon's rotations ensures that the far side of the moon is always facing away from the earth, a phenomenon known as ""tidal locking."" The Soviet Union captured the first images of the far side in 1959.

The far side's cratered surface will make the probe's planned ""soft"" landing far more challenging than previous landings on the near side, which has many flat areas.

Because signals cannot travel in a straight line between the earth and the moon's far side, China launched the Queqiao (""Magpie Bridge"") relay satellite into the moon's orbit in May.

The Chang'e mission, named after the moon goddess in Chinese mythology, follows China's first mission to the moon, the Yutu (""Jade Rabbit"") probe, in 2013.

Next year, Beijing plans to launch the Chang'e-5 lunar lander to collect and return samples from the lunar surface. If successful, it would be the first time samples have returned to earth since 1976.

China hopes to expand its multi-billion dollar space program to become a space power by 2030. Long-term goals include building a moon base and crewed space station and sending manned missions to the moon and Mars.

81,"Among the most striking discoveries of modern physics — if not the most striking — is that, in nature, time works differently from the familiar intuition we have of it.

Time, for instance, is not uniform: it flows at a different speed depending on where you are and how you move. In the 2014 film Interstellar, the hero travels to the vicinity of a black hole. On his return to Earth, he finds his daughter older than himself: she is an elderly lady, he is still middle-aged.

This is not Hollywood fantasy, it is how the world truly works. The film’s scientific consultant Kip Thorne has since received the Nobel Prize in physics, for his role in detecting the gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes. He knows his topic. If we do not experience similar time distortions in our daily life, it is only because here on Earth they are too small for us to notice.

It is not the first time science has shown our intuitions to be mistaken. Science is constantly learning something new, and more often than not such learning means jettisoning wrong ideas. That is why science often clashes with common sense — our intuition wants Earth to be flat and still, and time to be the same everywhere. None of this is true.

Time is a mystery that has always troubled us, stirring deep emotions. Perhaps it is because, as Buddha put it, our difficulty in dealing with impermanence (or the passage of time) is at the root of our suffering. Hans Reichenbach, in one of the most lucid books on the matter, The Direction of Time, suggested that it might have been in order to escape from this anxiety that the Greek philosopher Parmenides denied time’s existence, Plato imagined a world of ideas outside it and Hegel spoke of the moment in which the spirit transcends temporality.

It may be because of this that we have imagined the existence of “eternity”, a world outside time that we imagine inhabited by gods, a God or immortal souls. Our deeply emotional attitude towards the subject may have contributed more to the construction of cathedrals of philosophy than logic or reason did. The opposite emotional attitude — the veneration of time by thinkers such as Heraclitus or Henri Bergson — has given rise to just as many philosophies but still not brought us much nearer to understanding its reality.

Physics helps us to penetrate some layers of the mystery. But our grasp of the world is shaped by the vast dialogue that involves the whole of our culture, from physics to philosophy, literature to the neuro-sciences. All these crafts may be needed here. Physics has conclusively shown that the temporal structure of the world is different from our perception of it. It has given us the hope of being able to study the nature of time free from our emotional fog.

But in advancing towards quantum theories of gravity with a temporal structure far removed from our intuition, we end up losing our own sense of time. Just as Copernicus, by studying the revolutions of the heavens, ended up understanding that it is us rather than the sky that turns, exploring the nature of time leads us to discover something about ourselves. Perhaps, ultimately, the emotional dimension of time is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending its nature objectively. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is for us.

The uniform nature of time is scarcely the only feature where our intuition has turned out to be mistaken. To everybody’s surprise, the difference between past and future fails to show up in the elementary equations that govern the physical world. But the discovery that has been the most disconcerting of all has been finding out that the notion of “present” does not make sense in the larger universe; it only makes sense in the vicinity of us slow human critters.

“Here-and-now” is a well-defined notion in science, but “now” on its own is not. Philosophers are struggling greatly with this discovery: if we call reality that which exists now, what is reality after we have realised that there isn’t a well-defined “now” all over the universe? The very grammar we use to talk about things, in which verbs have only a past, future and present tense, is inadequate to describe the ways of nature.

In physics, a great debate on the nature of physical time has developed in an arc spanning from Aristotle to Newton and from Newton to Einstein. Our understanding has repeatedly deepened in the course of this process. For Aristotle, time is just a way to count what happens, but it becomes an autonomous flowing variable for Newton and is then reinterpreted by Einstein as a feature of the gravitational field.

Einstein’s great theory, general relativity, keeps receiving spectacular empirical support — confirming such counter-intuitive predictions as black holes, expansion of the universe, time dilation, gravitational waves and more. These give strong credibility to Einstein’s picture and continue to rule out alternative conjectures. But there is certainly more to learn.

We do not yet know the fate of matter falling into the black holes we see in the sky, where Einstein’s theory says that time comes to an end. And the full complexity of what we perceive as the flow of time is not accounted for by general relativity alone: it involves quantum theory, thermodynamics and probably more, including neuroscience and the cognitive sciences.

My own work in science has been concentrated on the effort to understand how the quantum nature of the world affects space and time. There is not yet agreement on a solution; but there is a rather large consensus around the expectation that the concept of physical time is likely to move even further away from our intuition, when its quantum properties are taken into account.

This is why reflecting on the nature of time is a constant concern for myself and many of my colleagues. Tentative theories of quantum spacetime have little that resembles time as we experience it. The basic equations of the theory on which I work, loop quantum gravity, have no special “time” variable at all. They describe processes in which things change but no single time variable can track all possible changes.

Does all this suggest our perception of time is illusory? It does not. But it indicates that what we perceive as time may not be a simple and elementary aspect of nature, but rather a complex phenomenon with many layers, each needing to be addressed by a different chapter of science. This is the true question about the nature of time: which aspects of our sense of it pertain to which domain of science?

Key aspects of time are described by the science of heat, thermodynamics. Any time the future is definitely distinguishable from the past, there is something like heat involved. Thermodynamics traces the direction of time to something called the “low entropy of the past”, a still mysterious phenomenon on which discussions rage. I have studied the hypothesis that some aspects of the solution might come from recognising a perspectival aspect for time. Think of the magnificent spectacle of the daily rotation of the sky: we see the sun, moon and stars, the entire cosmos, majestically rotating. It has taken millennia for us to understand why. To figure this out, we had to consider ourselves. It is not the vast cosmos that is rotating, it is we who live on a spinning rock. This is a perspectival explanation. Something similarly perspectival, I think, underpins our peculiar perception of the flow of time.

Entropy growth orients time and permits the existence of traces of the past, and these permit the possibility of memories, which hold together our sense of identity. I suspect that what we call the “flowing” of time has to be understood by studying the structure of our brain rather than by studying physics: evolution has shaped our brain into a machine that feeds off memory in order to anticipate the future. This is what we are listening to when we listen to the passing of time. Understanding the “flowing” of time is therefore something that may pertain to neuroscience more than to fundamental physics. Searching for the explanation of the feeling of flow in physics might be a mistake.

Our understanding depends on the neural structures shaped by the peculiar environment in which we live. They capture a very imprecise version of the actual temporal structure of reality. Our experience is an approximation of an approximation of a description of the world from our particular perspective as beings dependent on the growth of entropy, anchored to the thermodynamical arrow of time. For us, there is, as Ecclesiastes has it, a time to be born and a time to die. The time we experience is a multilayered, complex concept with distinct properties rooted in distinct layers of reality. Many parts of the full story are still far from being clear. Time remains, to a large extent, a mystery, perhaps the greatest one. A mystery that relates to issues ranging from the fate of black holes to the enigma of our individual identity and consciousness.

Will we be able to understand things better in the future? I think so. Our understanding of nature has increased vertiginously over the course of the centuries, and we are continuing to learn. We are glimpsing something about the mystery of time. We can see the world described by quantum theories of gravity: we can perceive with the mind’s eye the profound structure of the world where time as we know it no longer exists — just as Paul McCartney’s “Fool on the Hill” sees the world spinning round when he sees the sun going down.

I also think we are beginning to see that we are time. We are this clearing opened by the traces of memory inside the connections between our neurons. We are memory. We are nostalgia. We are longing for a future that will not come. Horace, the greatest poet of Roman antiquity and perhaps the greatest cantor of time, calls it our “brief circle” (“You must be wise. Pour the wine/and enclose in this brief circle/your long-cherished hope”). This clearing, opened up for us by memory and anticipation, is our time: a source of anguish on occasion, but in the end the marvellous gift of our existence.

240,"(CNN) Protests at a high school this week have shown what was true since before she was even sworn in as education secretary: Betsy DeVos is a lightning rod.

There was a dramatic outcry by Senate Democrats and a never-before-seen, tiebreaking vote to confirm her. Gun control groups rejected her comments on firearms on campus and critics said she'd spent her career undermining public schools.

After nearly four months on the job, the fires have only been stoked.

Critics seized on DeVos from the start. While her mother was a public school teacher, she never taught or worked in school administration herself. Instead, she founded organizations that pumped millions of dollars into efforts to promote charter schools, voucher programs and other alternatives to traditional public schools known collectively as school choice.

DeVos' believes her own remarks have ""not at all"" hurt her ability to transform the education system, spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said, providing a list of accomplishments so far. Those include rolling back education regulations proposed by the Obama administration, reforms to the student loan program, and a pro-school choice budget proposal for the federal government.

Here's a look at her most controversial moments so far:

DeVos landed back in the headlines this week after teachers and Connecticut's Democratic governor rallied against her outside East Hartford High School, protesting her characterization of the school in a recent appearance before Congress. She quoted a former student named Michael, who she said was shunted from grade-to-grade with barely passing marks while being bullied.

""This constant fear made him hate school. He described the school he was assigned to as and I quote 'nothing more than adult daycare, a dangerous daycare,' "" DeVos said. Teachers sent a ""message that they didn't think Michael would amount to much"" and there are ""countless other students like him.""

Gov. Dannel Malloy said the student's story ""undoubtedly had some validity for that individual"" but was an unfair characterization of the school and education system.

""To have those words that were repeated about this institution this community without any fact checking without any background doesn't speak well,"" said Malloy.

Once in office, DeVos visited a middle school in Washington, and later described the teachers she met as being in ""receive mode"" and are ""waiting to be told what they have to do,"" rather than ""empowered to facilitate great teaching.""

The school, Jefferson Academy, blasted DeVos in return, saying she's right only if ""you mean we 'receive' students at a 2nd grade level and move them to an 8th grade level.""

Her confirmation hearing answer to a gun-related question was made all the more memorable because of how she answered it.

DeVos has long advocated for voucher systems that give parents funds towards enrolling students at private schools. That position is already controversial, with critics saying a voucher system would undercut public schools.

""What if they said we are not accepting African-American students, but that was OK with the state,"" Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Massachusetts pressed her. ""Do you see any situation where you would step in?""

DeVos replied that the ""Office of Civil Rights and our Title IX (anti-discrimination) protections are broadly applicable across the board.""

""I am shocked that you cannot come up with one example of discrimination that you would stand up for students,"" responded Clark.

Colleges founded because of segregation were 'pioneers' of school choice

DeVos was accused of glossing over history after a meeting with officials from historically black colleges and universities.

Critics pointed out that Jim Crow laws and racist policies barred African-Americans from enrolling, prompting the creation of HBCUs. DeVos appeared to respond by later saying HBCUs were ""born not out of mere choice, but out of necessity, in the face of racism, and in the aftermath of the Civil War.""

In a recent speech, DeVos took blasted critics of her school choice vision.

730,"This article is the third in a series of three by Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner, the authors of the new book, "" The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) This is the third in a series of three op-eds tracing the long path of Vice President Mike Pence's ambition, from college, where he found a form of evangelicalism that weds theology to Republican politics, to the national stage -- and a job that puts him a short step away from the presidency. Part one: Mike Pence's plan to outlast Trump Part two: Mike Pence went to college and found God

Mike Pence won his first political campaign in 2000 using what became his basic strategy of guns, God, and money. He raised lots of cash by appealing to big-time conservative donors -- among them, Betsy DeVos, Charles and David Koch, and Erik Prince -- with hawkish positions on taxes and regulation. He found his voters at churches and gun clubs. He spiced his recipe with attacks on science that placed him to the right of many of his fellow Republicans.

Like a handful of Republicans, Pence made an issue of the pending agreement to settle government lawsuits against tobacco companies for lying for decades about the dangers of their addictive products. Pence didn't just oppose the deal. He insisted it was based on a lie and the result of a pernicious government plot.

""Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media,"" Pence wrote in 2000 , ""smoking doesn't kill. In fact, 2 out of every three smokers does not die from a smoking related illness and 9 out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer.""

Pence's first bit of data was simply wrong. Two-thirds of smokers actually do die of smoking-related illnesses. His second was misleading. Lung cancer is a relatively rare illness, but it is still vastly more common among smokers. In fact, it is one of the few cancers for which science has established a very well-known cause, and Pence's column was published after industry leaders had acknowledged the health risks of their product.

Why would a candidate for Congress speak so falsely and recklessly? Pence's motivation may have been connected to his family's ownership stake in a chain of convenience stores called Tobacco Road, which sold cigarettes alongside soft drinks and chips. But he was also eager to establish some libertarian street cred. ""A government big enough to go after smokers is big enough to go after you,"" he wrote.

If Pence's vocabulary was a bit 19th-century, so was his thinking. After calling Charles Darwin ""a sincere biologist,"" Pence attacked the science of evolution, which, in his telling, was conjecture and thus no worthier of respect than other notions about the origins of life. Darwin ""hoped that some day it would be proven by the fossil record but did not live to see that,"" declared Pence, ""nor have we.""

Of course, there is nothing uncertain in the prevailing science on the origins of life on Earth. As the National Academy of Science explains, a scientific theory is not merely conjecture. It is ""a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence."" This is why physicists still talk about a ""theory"" of gravity that explains why objects fall down and not up and biologists speak of ""cell theory,"" even though the fact that living things are composed of cells is established truth.

A willful denial of the facts was required for Pence to press his case against Darwin, but he was clearly devoted to this cause. Having cast doubt on the science of evolution, he said that he was only asking for everyone to be open-minded. ""I would simply and humbly ask ... can we also consider teaching other theories of the origin of species?""

Then, he declared that his own mind was shut.

""The Bible tells us that God created man in his own imagine, male and female,"" said Pence. ""He created them. And I believe that.""

Pence's speech on evolution, preserved on C-SPAN, was delivered in the cadence of a radio preacher. Pence had developed this way of speaking during his years as a broadcaster, when he pitched himself as ""Rush Limbaugh on decaf."" But as friendly as he sounded, Pence was determined to impose his religious views through public policy and to do it through the manipulation of language.

Another example was his proposal to use federal funds to turn gay people straight. So-called ""conversion therapy,"" promoted by quacks and religious bigots, assumes that homosexuality is a medically treatable pathology, which it is not. Pence's proposal never gained traction in Congress, but it was a loud dog whistle to those on the homophobic Christian right.

With his sights set on the White House, Pence sought executive experience back home in Indiana, where a GOP advantage in registration helped him win a narrow victory in the 2012 governor's race. He installed his wife, Karen, in an office at the state house, a first for first ladies of the state, and had a pair of red phones wired to connect his desk directly with hers.

Pence was unremarkable as governor, save for his commitment to the causes of Christian conservatives in pushing a state law that permitted discrimination against gay customers by businesses. When Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 2015 was approved, Pence signed it into law in a rare, private ceremony where he was flanked by clergy from a variety of religions.

Reaction to RFRA and the photo was intense. Pence backed down, seeking amendments that watered down the law. But while the episode seemed to threaten his future, he was rescued by Donald Trump's offer to join his ticket as the GOP's 2016 candidate for vice president.

Six months into the new administration, Republicans were already talking about how Pence seemed to be running a shadow campaign to become the GOP nominee for president in the event that Trump was felled by either the Russia scandal or some other force. Pence's chief of staff is a sharp-elbowed political player named Nick Ayers, and his connections to big donors are strong. Organized and methodical where the President is chaotic and impulsive, Pence is ready to achieve the dream he believes God wants him to fulfill.

Should Pence achieve his goal, he would likely remake the GOP, now almost a cult devoted to Donald Trump, as a Christian right political party where people of other faiths would struggle to find a home. Instead of policy driven by personality, a Pence administration would likely pursue policy guided by a particular reading of the Bible. And the divisions that now seem to be separating Americans would become broader, deeper, and even more difficult to bridge.",mainstream,M15c4d,flat.earth
579,"Flat Earthers debunked: How we know the Earth and Moon are spheres, not discs

The rapper B.o.B. declared on Twitter last month that Earth is flat, claiming to have pictures to back up his outlandish claims. The incident provoked responses from high profile scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson, who noted such statements made by a public figure are responsible for a strain of anti-intellectualism plaguing the nation.

Unfortunately, few scientists seized the opportunity to explain why we know the Earth is in fact a globe. The following, therefore, highlights some of the foremost reasons why we know the Earth is round.

The moon is not made of cheese and the world is not flat. This can be observed during a lunar eclipse, which occurs whenever the Earth’s orbit places it in-between the sun and moon. The Earth casts a round shadow on the moon. Since the Earth is rotating and consistently casting a round shadow on the moon during every eclipse, its proves beyond a shadow (forgive the pun) of a doubt that the Earth is in fact round.

Anyone who has ever waited for a ship to dock will notice that a ship does not sporadically appear off the horizon but gradually emerges from beneath the ocean. The reason ships do not emerge from the ocean – nor fall off the edge of Earth – is because the planet is round. The fact that ships appear to emerge from the depths of the sea is an illusion cast by Earth’s curvature.

If you place a stick upright, it will cast a shadow. The length of the shadow changes throughout the day. If the world was flat, then two sticks at different places should produce the same shadows. The problem is they don’t, which only makes sense if the Earth is round. In fact, Eratosthenes took note of this phenomena to calculate the circumference of the Earth nearly 2,200 years ago.

The curvature of the Earth

If the Earth were flat, then we all would stand on an equal playing field. The problem, as anyone who has ever stood atop of a hill knows, is that the higher elevated you are, the more you can see. At certain heights, you can actually see the curvature of the Earth. This makes complete sense if the Earth is round and absolutely no sense if the Earth is flat.

Different time zones exist because the world is an orbiting globe. When the sun shines on a spot of land, the other side is darkened (and vise versa). This creates time differences. If Earth was flat, the sun would shine on everyone at the same time.

Flat Earth theory is based upon an outdated understanding of gravity. Conventional understandings of gravity are incompatible with Flat Earth theory, because they require a spherical mass pulling all objects towards its center. Flat-Earthers propos that a disk-shaped Earth is accelerating “upward,” which gives the illusion of gravity. Of course, no explanation is given why or how the Earth is accelerating upwards.

As the noted list has shown, not only are Flat-Earthers misinformed – they’re square. Anyone who doubts the existence of gravity is invited to jump out of a three story building.",conspiracy,C04165,flat.earth
744,"A 'self-taught rocket scientist' has failed in his bid to launch 5,000 feet (1,520m) into the air after the $325 (£270) boiler he bought off Craigslist broke down.

'Mad' Mike Hughes, 63, attempted the feat aboard his steam-powered rocket at Amboy in California's Mojave Desert.

But his budget boiler didn't have the power needed to heat water to 200°C (400°F) and generate the steam required for the rocket to lift-off.

A spokesman for Mr Hughes said that he plans to try another launch on Saturday, August 17.

'I believe the Earth is flat,' he said, but that 'this flat Earth has nothing to do with the steam rocket launches. It never did. It never will. I'm a daredevil!

In a press statement ahead of the launch, he added: The 'launch is about my personal desire to inspire my fellow Americans to help make this country great again.'

In March 2018 Mr Hughes, who believes the Earth is flat, propelled himself 1,875 feet (6,150m) into the air aboard a previous incarnation of the rocket before a hard landing in the Mojave Desert.

Mr Hughes, who lives in Apple Valley, California, has seen a flurry of criticism over his plans in recent years.

Detractors have labelled him a crackpot for planning launches in his homemade contraptions, as well as his belief that the world is flat.

'I hope he doesn't blow something up,' retired NASA astronaut Jerry Linenger said ahead of the March 2018 launch.

Linenger orbited the globe more than 2,000 times during four months in 1997. 'Rocketry, as our private space companies found out, isn't as easy as it looks.'

Mr Hughes often spars with his critics on social media and has always maintained that his mission isn't to prove the Earth is flat.

'Do I believe the Earth is shaped like a Frisbee? I believe it is,' Mr Hughes has said. 'Do I know for sure? No. That's why I want to go up in space.'

That's his project for down the road. He wants to build a 'Rockoon,' a rocket that is carried into the atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon, then separated from the balloon and lit. This rocket would take Hughes about 68 miles up.

This is the third time Mr Hughes has constructed and launched a rocket.

On January, 30, 2014, Mr Hughes said he travelled 1,374 feet on private property in Winkelman, Arizona.

He collapsed after that landing and needed three days to recover but there wasn't any footage of him climbing into the craft, leading some to question whether he even took off.",mainstream,M15d52,flat.earth
350,"During the period of roughly February 1992 to mid 1994, I was making frequent trips to Moscow, Russia, in the process of starting a software development joint-venture company with some people from the Russian scientific community. One of the men in charge on the Russian side was named V. M.; he had a wife named T.M. V. was a level-headed scientist while his wife was rather deeply committed to the losing Communist cause - a cause she obviously was not abandoning. One evening, during a trip early in 1992, the American half of our venture were invited to V. & T.'s Moscow flat as we were about to return to the States. The party went well and we had the normal dinner discussions. As the evening wore on, T. developed a decidedly rough anti-American edge - one her husband tried to quietly rein in. The bottom line of the tirade she started against the United States went something like this: ""You Americans always like to think that you have the perfect government and your people are always so perfect. Well then, why haven't you had a woman president by now? You had a chance to vote for a woman vice-president and you didn't do it."" The general response went something along the lines that you don't vote for someone just because of their sex. Besides, you don't vote for vice-president, but the president and vice-president as a ticket. ""Well, I think you are going to be surprised when you get a black president very soon."" The consensus we expressed was that we didn't think there was anything innately barring that. The right person at the right time and sure, America would try to vote for the right person, be he or she black or not. ""What if I told you that you will have a black president very soon and he will be a Communist?"" The out-of-the-blue remark was met by our stares. She continued, ""Well, you will; and he will be a Communist."" It was then that the husband unsuccessfully tried to change the subject; but she was on a roll and would have nothing of it. One of us asked, ""It sounds like you know something we don't know."" ""Yes, it is true. This is not some idle talk. He is already born and he is educated and being groomed to be president right now. You will be impressed to know that he has gone to the best schools of Presidents. He is what you call ""Ivy League"". You don't believe me, but he is real and I even know his name. His name is Barack. His mother is white and American and his father is black from Africa. That's right, a chocolate baby! And he's going to be your President."" She became more and more smug as she presented her stream of detailed knowledge and predictions so matter-of-factly - as though all were foregone conclusions. ""It's all been thought out. His father is not an American black so he won't have that social slave stigma. He is intelligent and he is half white and has been raised from the cradle to be an atheist and a Communist. He's gone to the finest schools. He is being guided every step of the way and he will be irresistible to America."" We sat there not knowing what to say. She was obviously very happy that the Communists were doing this and that it would somehow be a thumbing of their collective noses at America: they would give us a black president and he'd be a Communist to boot. She made it quite obvious that she thought that this was going to breathe new life into world Communism. From this and other conversations with her, she always asserted that Communism was far from dead. She was full of little details about him that she was eager to relate. I thought that maybe she was trying to show off that this truly was a real person and not just hot air. She rattled off a complete litany. He was from Hawaii. He went to school in California. He lived in Chicago. He was soon to be elected to the legislature. ""Have no doubt: he is one of us, a Soviet."" At one point, she related some sort of San Francisco connection, but I didn't understand what the point was and don't recall much about that. I was just left with the notion that she considered the city to be some sort of a center for their activity here. Since I had dabbled in languages, I knew a smattering of Arabic. I made a comment: ""If I remember correctly, 'Barack' comes from the Arabic word for 'Blessing.' That seems to be an odd name for an American."" She replied quickly, ""Yes. It is 'African'"", she insisted, ""and he will be a blessing for world Communism. We will regain our strength and become the number one power in the world."" She continued with something to the effect that America was at the same time the great hope and the great obstacle for Communism. America would have to be converted to Communism and Barack was going to pave the way. So, what does this conversation from 1992 prove? Well, it's definitely anecdotal. It doesn't prove that Obama has had Soviet Communist training nor that he was groomed to be the first black American president, but it does show one thing that I think is very important. It shows that Soviet Russian Communists knew of Barack from a very early date. It also shows that they truly believed among themselves that he was raised and groomed Communist to pave the way for their future. This report on Barack came personally to me from one of them long before America knew he existed. Although I had never before heard of him, at the time of this conversation Obama was 30+ years old and was obviously tested enough that he was their anticipated rising star.",conspiracy,C0246c,barack.obama; flat.earth
220,"Carlos Maza, a video journalist who works for Vox is speaking out after YouTube declined to ban the videos of Steven Crowder, a prominent right-wing personality who Maza says used the platform to attack him with homophobic and racist slurs.

The company did say it would demonetize the videos, meaning they can't make money off of ads, for ""continued egregious actions that have harmed the broader community.""

Maza, who is gay and of Cuban descent, spoke to CNN Business on Wednesday, the morning after YouTube announced that Crowder's videos ""don't violate our policies.""

The Google-owned company has a history of demonetizing controversial videos and not including them as suggested content instead of removing them completely. Maza said the demonetizing was not enough, as Crowder could still make money selling merchandise through a link on YouTube.

Some background: On May 30, Maza tweeted a video compilation of clips collected over a number of years in which Crowder and his co-hosts respond to Maza's popular ""Strikethrough"" series — a media criticism show that often takes on right-wing media. In Crowder's YouTube videos, they describe Maza in starkly homophobic terms and also include attacks on his ethnicity.

Maza told CNN that he had privately flagged Crowder's videos in the past to YouTube, but after the company refused to take them down he decided to go public.

On Wednesday, Crowder tweeted about the decision by YouTube, saying, ""YouTube and Vox have launched an all out WAR on ALL independent creators. Thousands of channels under review!""

We had never heard of this nor seen a picture like this before, so we thought we’d share the following with you…

NASA recently shared the photo above of a nearly perfect rectangular iceberg in Antarctica that they took as part of “Operation IceBridge, a mission to image Earth’s polar regions in order to understand how ice (thickness, location, accumulation, etc.) has been changing in recent years.” The “monolithic slab of ice” was found floating near the Larsen C ice shelf.

However, while the iceberg might seem totally unnatural and manufactured (cut) to look that way, it is actually a natural phenomenon.

Called a tabular iceberg, they have steep, nearly vertical sides, a flat plateau top and typically break off of ice shelves (which are tabular bodies of thick ice).

Ice shelves form where the land meets the ocean. “As ice flow from the continental land mass down to the ocean, it eventually spills out over the ocean, in some places floating and in other places partially supported by the ocean floor. The ice that sits over the ocean but is attached to the land is an ice shelf. “

It didn’t take long from the birth of the world wide web for the public to start using this new medium to transmit, collect and analyze information in ways never before imagined. The first message boards and clunky “Web 1.0” websites soon gave way to “the blogosphere.” The arrival of social media was the next step in this evolution, allowing for the formation of communities of interest to share information in real time about events happening anywhere on the globe.

But as quickly as communities began to form around these new platforms, governments and militaries were even quicker in recognizing the potential to use this new medium to more effectively spread their own propaganda.

Their goal? To shape public discourse around global events in a way favourable to their standing military and geopolitical objectives.

Their method? The Weaponization of Social Media.

This is The Corbett Report.

Facebook. Twitter. YouTube. Snapchat. Instagram. Reddit. “Social media” as we know it today barely existed fifteen years ago. Although it provides new ways to interact with people and information from all across the planet virtually instantaneously and virtually for free, we are only now beginning to understand the depths of the problems associated with these new platforms. More and more of the original developers of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter admit they no longer use social media themselves and actively keep it away from their children, and now they are finally admitting the reason why: social media was designed specifically to take advantage of your psychological weaknesses and keep you addicted to your screen.

SEAN PARKER: If the thought process that went into building these applications—Facebook being the first of them to really understand it—that thought process was all about “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?” And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever, and that’s gonna get you to contribute more content and that’s gonna get you more likes and comments. So it’s a social validation feedback loop. I mean it’s exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. And I think that we—the inventors/creators, you know, it’s me, it’s Mark, it’s Kevin Systrom at Instagram, it’s all of these people—understood this consciously and we did it anyway.

It should be no surprise, then, that in this world of social media addicts and smartphone zombies, the 24/7 newsfeed is taking up a greater and greater share of people’s lives. Our thoughts, our opinions, our knowledge of the world, even our mood are increasingly being influenced or even determined by what we see being posted, tweeted or vlogged. And the process by which these media shape our opinions is being carefully monitored and analyzed, not by the social media companies themselves, but by the US military.

MARINA PORTNAYA: When the world’s largest social media platform betrays its users, there’s going to be outrage. ABC HOST: The study to see whether Facebook could influence the emotional state of its users on that news feed. CNN ANCHOR: It allowed researchers to manipulate almost 700,000 users’ news feeds. Some saw more positive news about their friends, others saw more negative. CNN GUEST: Well I’m not surprised. I mean we’re all kind of lab rat than the big Facebook experiment. PORTNAYA: But it wasn’t only Facebook’s experiment. It turns out the psychological study was connected to the US government’s research on social unrest. MORNING JOE GUEST: This is really kind of creepy. PORTNAYA: And it gets worse. What you may not know is that the US Department of Defense has reportedly spent roughly $20 million conducting studies aimed at learning how to manipulate online behavior in order to influence opinion. The initiative was launched in 2011 by the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, otherwise known as DARPA. The program is best described as the US media’s effort to become better at detecting and conducting propaganda campaigns via social media. Translation: When anti-government messages gain ground virally, Washington wants to find a way to spread counter opinion.

The DARPA document that details the Pentagon’s plans for influencing opinions in the social media space is called “Social Media in Strategic Communication.” DARPA’s goal, according to their own website, is “to develop tools to help identify misinformation or deception campaigns and counter them with truthful information.”

Exactly what tools were developed for this purpose and how they are currently being deployed is unclear. But Rand Walzman, the program’s creator, admitted last year that the project lasted four years, cost $50 million and led to the publication of over 200 papers. The papers, including “Incorporating Human Cognitive Biases in a Probabilistic Model of Retweeting,” “Structural Properties of Ego Networks,” and “Sentiment Prediction using Collaborative Filtering,” make the thrust of the program perfectly clear. Social media users are lab rats being carefully scrutinized by government-supported researchers, their tweets and Facebook posts and Instagram pictures being analyzed to determine how information spreads online, and, by implication, how the government and the military can use these social media networks to make their own propaganda “go viral.”

As worrying as this research is, it pales in comparison to the knowledge that governments, militaries and political lobby groups are already employing squadrons of foot soldiers to wage information warfare in the social media battlespace.

CTV ANCHOR: So is it okay to have the government monitor social media conversations and then to wade in and correct some of those conversations? With more on this, let’s go to technology expert Carmi Levy. He’s on the line from Montreal. Carmi, do you think the government’s monitoring what you and I are saying right now? Is this whole thing getting out of line, or what? CARMI LEVY: It opens up a bit of a question. I’d like to call it a Pandora’s box about, you know, what exactly is the government’s aim here, and what do they hope to accomplish with what they find out? And as they accumulate this information online—this data on us—where does that data go? And so I think as much as we should applaud the government for getting into this area, the optics of it are potentially very Big Brother-ish. And the government really does need to be a little bit more concrete on what its intentions are and how it intends to achieve them.

4WWL REPORTER: New evidence that government-owned computers at the Army Corps of Engineers office here in New Orleans are being used to verbally attack critics of the Corps comes in an affidavit from the former editor-in-chief of nola.com. Jon Donley, who was laid off this past February, tells us via satellite from Texas, in late 2006 he started noticing people presenting themselves as ordinary citizens defending the Corps very energetically. JON DONLEY: What stuck out, though, was the wording of the comments was in many ways mirroring news releases from the Corps of Engineers. SANDY ROSENTHAL: These commenters tried to discredit these people . . . 4WWL REPORTER: And when Rosenthal investigated, she discovered the comments were coming from users at the internet provider address of the Army Corps of Engineers offices here in New Orleans. She blamed the Corps for a strategy of going after critics. ROSENTHAL: In the process of trying to obscure the facts of the New Orleans floodings, one of their tactics was just verbal abuse.

These operations are only the visible and publicly-admitted front of a vast array of military and intelligence programs that are attempting to influence online behaviour, spread government propaganda, and disrupt online communities that arise in opposition to their agenda.

That such programs exist is not a matter of conjecture; it is mundane, established, documented fact.

In 2014, an internal document was leaked from GCHQ, the British equivalent of the NSA. The document, never intended for public release, was entitled “The Art of Deception: Training for a New Generation of Online Covert Operations” and bluntly stated that “We want to build Cyber Magicians.” It then goes on to outline the “magic” techniques that must be employed in influence and information operations online, including deception and manipulation techniques like “anchoring,” “priming” and “branding” propaganda narratives. After presenting a map of social networking technologies that are targeted by these operations, the document then instructs the “magicians” how to deceive the public through “attention management” and behavioural manipulation.

That governments would turn to these strategies is hardly a shocking development. In fact, the use of government shills to propagate government talking points and disrupt online dissent has been openly advocated on the record by high-ranking government officials for the past decade.

In 2008, Cass Sunstein, a law professor who would go on to become Obama’s information “czar,” co-authored a paper entitled “Conspiracy Theories,” in which he wrote that the “best response” to online “conspiracy theories” is what he calls “cognitive infiltration” of groups spreading these ideas.

It is perhaps particularly ironic that the idea that government agents are actually and admittedly spreading propaganda online under false identities is, to the less-informed members of the population, itself a “conspiracy theory” rather than an established conspiracy fact.

Unsurprisingly, when confronted about his proposal, Sunstein pretended to not remember having written it and then pointedly refused to answer any questions about it.

Now, a decade on from Sunstein’s proposal, we know that military psyops agents, political lobbyists, corporate shills and government propagandists are spending vast sums of money and employing entire armies of keyboard warriors, leaving comments and shaping conversations to change the public’s opinions, influence their behaviour, and even alter their mood. And they are helped along in this quest by the very same technology that allows the public to connect on a scale never before possible.

Technology is always a double-edged sword, and sometimes it can be dangerous to wield that sword at all. There are ways to identify and neutralize the threat of online trolls and shills, but the phenomenon is not likely to go away any time soon.

Each of us must find our own answer to the question of how best to incorporate these technologies into our life. But the next time you find yourself caught up in an argument with an online persona that may or may not be a genuine human being, it might be better to ask yourself if your efforts are better spent engaging in the argument or just turning off the computer.",conspiracy,C01086,flat.earth

605,"From sea shells and spiral galaxies to the structure of human lungs, the patterns of chaos are all around us. Fractals are patterns formed from chaotic equations and contain self-similar patterns of complexity increasing with magnification. If you divide a fractal pattern into parts you get a nearly identical reduced-size copy of the whole. The mathematical beauty of fractals is that infinite complexity is formed with relatively simple equations. By iterating or repeating fractal-generating equations many times, random outputs create beautiful patterns that are unique, yet recognizable. We have pulled together some of the most stunning natural examples we could find of fractals on our planet. Above: This variant form of cauliflower is the ultimate fractal vegetable. Its pattern is a natural representation of the Fibonacci or golden spiral, a logarithmic spiral where every quarter turn is farther from the origin by a factor of phi, the golden ratio.

Extinct for 65 million years, ammonites were marine cephalopods that built chambered spiral shells. The walls between these chambers, called sutures, were complex fractal curves. Stephen Jay Gould used the complexity of ammonite sutures over time to argue that there is no evolutionary drive toward greater complexity and that we are a ""glorious accident,"" alone in the universe. The shells of ammonites also grow as a logarithmic spiral, a pattern that appears often in nature, as with romanesco broccoli. Ammonites also inspired this cathedral staircase in Barcelona, Spain.

Mountains are the result of tectonic forces pushing the crust upward and erosion tearing some of that crust down. The resulting pattern is a fractal.

Ferns are a common example of a self-similar set, meaning that their pattern can be mathematically generated and reproduced at any magnification or reduction. The mathematical formula that describes ferns, named after Michael Barnsley, was one of the first to show that chaos is inherently unpredictable yet generally follows deterministic rules based on nonlinear iterative equations. In other words, random numbers generated over and over using Barnsley's Fern formula ultimately produce a unique fern-shaped object. Images: 1) Flickr/cobalt123. 2) Flickr/CatDancing.

According the NASA Earth Observatory, it is highly unusual to see such a sharp boundary in a continual cloud formation such as this, and scientists have yet to explain how it could form. Below, the 200-mile long series of cloud vortexes is perhaps the longest of these formations ever photographed, according to NASA. These cloud vortexes are also called von Kármán cloud streets, for the late fluid dynamicist Theodore von Kármán. Cloud streets form when low-lying clouds are interrupted by an object such as an island. Similar patterns occur in the wind flow downstream of airplane wings.

1195,"Many ancient mysteries are waiting to be unraveled this century, as science and technology continue to advance. Seen as the “new age of exploration”, the 21st century promises to solve some of the most intriguing puzzles of our current history.

Scientists are still discussing the purpose of the Nazca lines. Do these complex geoglyphs in Peru symbolize constellations?

Are they compared to giant alien landing spots, or are these signs showing the way for their ships? For now, no theory seems plausible enough when it comes to explaining their purpose.

These are the famous Nazca lines, a mystery that has concerned countless researchers for over 80 years. These mysterious markings were built on the ground, but can only be seen from above. It’s worth mentioning that the area is mostly flat and cannot offer a higher view of the glyphs.

The Nazca Lines can be found in the Nazca Desert, a barren plateau that expands between the city of Nasca and Palpa on the pampa, which is a smooth, desolated area of southern Peru. They cover-up an era of desert of nearly 400 square miles.

Overall, there are more than 800 successive lines, 300 geometric figures and 70 animal and plant designs. Some of the straight lines stretch over 30 miles, while the other designs range from 50 to 1,200 feet in length, being as large as the Empire State Building.

Enormous geoglyphs are found in other places on Earth, such as Egypt, Chile, Bolivia, the United States (Mississippi and California), Malta and in other countries.

However, the Nazca geoglyphs form an impressive and mysterious archaeological group because of their number, range, typical features as well as cultural continuity and preservation over the centuries.

The Nazca plain is remarkable for its ability to maintain the markings intact over a long period of time.

Because the climate is one of the driest on Earth, recording only twenty minutes of rainfall each year, and the rocky soil which reduces the effect of wind at ground level, this barren place is ideal for preserving a work of art for eternity.

The clarity and positioning of the lines and drawings leave no doubt that an exhaustive and long-term effort was instrumental in their creation.

There are diverse designs consisting of shapes of animals, plants, objects, flowers, and even huge manlike figures made with well-defined lines. The most renowned drawing is of a weird being looking similar to an astronaut.

Measuring close to 100 feet in length, it was discovered by Maria Reiche in the 1960’s. Another curious representation is of a strange being with two huge, monstrous hands, one of them possessing only four fingers.

South of the Nazca Lines, on the pampa, archaeologists have discovered the ancient city of the line-builders – Cahuachi.

It was constructed almost two thousand years ago and was inexplicably deserted 500 years later. Recent findings at Cahuachi are starting to slowly blow the dust off this ancient mystery.

Italian researcher Giuseppe Orefici has been uncovering the site’s secrets for the past decades, bringing a team down each year.

He concluded that the settlement’s population was quite small, but the city was also a pilgrimage center that brought a huge increase in population whenever ceremonial events occurred.

These events seemingly concerned the Nazca Lines and the colossal sand dune of Nasca.

This theory seems very plausible because of the archaeological evidence provided by the Nazca lines, showing creatures such as a killer whales and monkeys, which did not exist in the Nazca region.

Because of the arid climate the recent findings consist of clothing and amazingly preserved mummified bodies of the Nazca people.

Archaeologist Fredrik Hiebert considers that our current progress in technology will help in solving this ancient mystery:",conspiracy,C01287,flat.earth
265,"BARSTOW, Calif. (AP) — A California man who said he wanted to fly to the edge of outer space to see if the world is round has died after his home-built rocket blasted off into the desert sky and plunged back to earth.

“Mad” Mike Hughes was killed on Saturday afternoon after his rocket crashed on private property near Barstow, California.

Waldo Stakes, a colleague who was at the rocket launch, said Hughes, 64, was killed.

The Science Channel said on Twitter it had been chronicling Hughes’ journey and that “thoughts & prayers go out to his family & friends during this difficult time.”

“It was always his dream to do this launch,” the Twitter message said.

Hughes also was a limousine driver, who held the Guinness world record for “longest limousine ramp jump,” for jumping 103 feet (31 meters) in a Lincoln Town Car stretch limousine, at a speedway in 2002.

A video on TMZ.com showed the rocket taking off, with what appears to be a parachute tearing off during the launch. The steam-powered rocket streaks upward, then takes around 10 seconds to fall straight back to earth. Shrieks can be heard as the rocket plows into the desert.

Freelance journalist Justin Chapman, who was at the scene, said the rocket appeared to rub against the launch apparatus, which might have caused the mishap with the parachute.

In March 2018, Hughes propelled himself about 1,875 feet (570 meters) into the air. He deployed one parachute and then a second one but still had a hard landing in the Mojave Desert in California, and injured his back.

“This thing wants to kill you 10 different ways,” Hughes said after that launch. “This thing will kill you in a heartbeat.”

He said in a video that his goal was to eventually fly to the edge of outer space to determine for himself whether the world is round.

“I don’t want to take anyone else’s word for it,” he said in the video, posted on the BBC News website. “I don’t know if the world is flat or round.”

In another video posted on his YouTube site, Hughes said he also wanted “to convince people they can do things that are extraordinary with their lives.”

“My story really is incredible,” Hughes once told The Associated Press. “It’s got a bunch of story lines — the garage-built thing. I’m an older guy. It’s out in the middle of nowhere, plus the Flat Earth. The problem is it brings out all the nuts also.”",mainstream,M0b64c,flat.earth
432,"HOLLYWOOD (CNN) -- Any student of Shakespeare could have told ""Xena, Warrior Princess"" fans what was going to happen to Julius Caesar in last season's cliffhanger episode, ""The Ides of March."" The surprise was what happened to Xena (Lucy Lawless) and her sidekick, Gabrielle (played by Reneé O'Connor). They were crucified by the Romans. People dying and coming back are fairly common in the ""Xena"" universe, but coming back from a season-ending crucifixion called for something more than just a shower scene in the fall. So this week's fifth-season premiere, ""Fallen Angel,"" sets something of a record for hour-long television shows, thanks to 270 special-effect shots in which Xena carries on the good fight in the afterlife. ""Xena"" is written and shot in New Zealand, but the special effects are made at Flat Earth Productions Inc. in Burbank, California. When the Flat Earth crew saw the ""Fallen Angel"" script, says 3-D effects supervisor Mark Tamny, there was ""shock at first. And then you start to come up with a plan to figure out how you're actually going to achieve all the shots -- how it's all going to come together."" The special-effects crew gets involved in every part of a production of this kind, from piecing together real elements to embellishing the truth with realistic-looking fakes. In one shot, they might start off with Lawless as an archdemon, shot against a blue screen. That's part of the ""chroma key"" process that allows the development of composite images used in television in many weather forecasts and in film for special effects. And what effects -- behind Lawless goes a painted background: some digital rocky pillars, a squadron of flying digital demons, and after a few hundred hours of work, magic. To make the magic happen, the actor is shot in front of a blue screen (1), then a background is created (2), and flying demons are animated (3). Then all are composited together for a final shot (4). Some of the shots, like evil Callisto (Hudson Leick) drop-kicking a hapless angel, were delivered on film. But the special effects crew had to erase the wires that held him up, speed up the angel's motion and even add some digital-camera motion. ""We didn't want it to look like if this was a real environment that they actually just planted a camera on one of these pillars,"" says composing artist Todd Vaziri. ""We wanted to give you the impression that maybe it was from a helicopter, or some kind of a gliding mechanism or something."" Some of the flying sequences couldn't be done with real actors on wires, so digital stand-ins were created on the drafting board. ""What we deliver is different elements,"" says Mark Kochinski, another 3-D effects supervisor, as he shows off his work. ""Like, this is Xena flying, and then this is the beam of light she's flying through. And then when the shot is composited, you can see her flying through the clouds, which are a separate element."" Some effects executed on film in New Zealand needed some high-tech touch ups in California, among them archangel Gabrielle's wings, which didn't work on film. ""We went into the shot,"" says Kochinski, ""removed the wings that she was wearing, created some three-dimensional wings that were a bit more animated and then married them to her body for that shot."" ""Xena, Warrior Princess"" carries the battle way beyond real life almost every week. But in order to get this far -- like past life itself -- and come back next week, it sure helps to know some special-effects wizards.

It was voter suppression! It was Citizens United! It was fake news! It was WikiLeaks! It was Facebook! It was the Russians!

Today, a new excuse: It was Jon Stewart!

In the middle of last week, Huma Abedin must have bustled over to Hillary’s place with a lovingly bound copy of the latest in cutting-edge academic research, a report that says Jon Stewart’s retirement is ACKSHULLY the reason Donald Trump won. We’ll all be able to hear more about this in Frau Pantsuit’s next memoir, “7,573 Other Reasons I Lost That Totally Were Not My Fault, You Ungrateful Pissants.”

The latest in cutting-edge political science/flat-earth theory is that after Stewart quit hosting a comedy show for liberals, the advantage swung to Trump because Democrats forgot there was an election or something.

Proving that the nation’s professoriate is even more obtuse than you would have suspected, Ethan Porter of George Washington University and Thomas J. Wood of Ohio State University note that when Stewart departed “The Daily Show,” ratings sank. “The transition at ‘The Daily Show’ spurred a 1.1% increase in Trump’s county-level vote share,” they claim in their paper, “Did Jon Stewart Elect Donald Trump? Evidence From Television Ratings Data” published in the journal Electoral Studies.

298,"On February 3, 1851, a 32-year-old Frenchman—who’d dropped out of medical school and dabbled in photography—definitively demonstrated that the Earth indeed rotated, surprising the Parisian scientific establishment.

Acting on a hunch, Léon Foucault had determined that he could use a pendulum to illustrate the effect of the Earth’s movement. He called together a group of scientists, enticing them with a note declaring, “You are invited to see the Earth turn.” Foucault hung a pendulum from the ceiling of the Meridian Room of the Paris Observatory. As it swept through the air, it traced a pattern that effectively proved the world was spinning about an axis.

A month later, Foucault shared his experiment with all of Paris at the majestic Pantheon building. According to the American Physical Society, he suspended from the Pantheon’s lofty dome a 61-pound brass bob on a 220-foot cable. As it swung back and forth, the pointed end of the bob traced lines in sand that had been poured on a wooden platform. Over time, the angle of these lines changed, suggesting to audience members that the direction of the pendulum’s travel was shifting under the influence of an unperceived rotational motion—that of Earth.

Foucault was able to demonstrate a scientific concept in a way that the average person could easily grasp, says Rebecca C. Thompson, head of public outreach for the APS. For centuries, it was a commonly held belief that the Earth rotated on an axis. But it was Foucault who dispelled lingering doubts once and for all, establishing the phenomenon firmly in the realm of fact. “It really started the cultural shift to fundamentally understanding our universe differently,” Thompson says.

The experiment was a hit, drawing flocks of fascinated Parisians and catapulting Foucault to fame. Pendulums based on Foucault’s calculations began appearing worldwide—and are still iconic features of many science museums in the U.S. and other countries.

The Smithsonian Institution made a pendulum a focal point of its Museum of History and Technology (which later became the National Museum of American History). The building—which opened in 1964 on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.—was designed purposely to accommodate a pendulum. It hung from the ceiling of the third floor and stretched 71 feet through the center of the building, where it swung slowly and rhythmically across a fancifully emblazoned circle on the first floor. The Smithsonian pendulum was intended to be viewed from above, on the second floor.

Looking down, visitors would see a symmetrical hollow brass bob weighing about 240 pounds and shaped like an inverted teardrop. As it moved back and forth—facilitated by an electromagnetic push to keep it continuously swinging despite air resistance and vibrations in the cable—it would knock down inch-or-so-high pins standing at fixed points along the circumference of a small circle. Over time, viewers could see the direction of the pendulum’s swing change, implying that the Earth was rotating beneath them.

The Smithsonian pendulum, like all pendulums, moved in accordance with Foucault’s sine law, which predicts how much a pendulum’s path will distort each day based on its latitude. Absent any exterior forces, a pendulum would swing back and forth in a single plane forever—there would be no gradual angular shift. But the Earth is rotating, so the story isn’t that simple.

Since all points on Earth’s surface rotate as a unit, it follows that those located on the wider portions of the planet—nearer to the equator—must cover more meters each second (i.e., go faster) to “keep up” with the points tracing smaller circles each day at the extreme northern and southern latitudes. Though they don’t feel it, a person standing in Quito, Ecuador, is moving with appreciably higher velocity than one in Reykjavik, Iceland.

Because each swing of a pendulum takes it from a point farther from the equator to a point nearer to the equator and vice versa, and the velocities at these points differ, the path of the pendulum is subtly distorted with every swing, gradually torqued away from its original orientation. The extent of this effect depends on where on Earth the pendulum is swinging.

At the North Pole—where small changes in latitude have big implications—the path traced by a pendulum would shift through a full 360 degrees in a mere 24 hours, explains Thompson. At the equator, meanwhile, a pendulum’s motion would not be seen to distort at all.

Using his sine law, Foucault predicted that the path of his pendulum in Paris would shift 11.25 degrees each hour, or 270 degrees in a day. And it did.

His sine law allows anyone with a decent grounding in trigonometry to use a pendulum to determine their latitude. But mostly, at museums around the world, the pendulum has become an object that elicits wonder.

As iconic as the elephant that greets visitors in the rotunda of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, the pendulum at the History and Technology museum was a meeting place, a striking backdrop for reflection and education. “It was very much like a fountain in a park,” says Peter Liebhold, a curator in the division of work and industry at the American History Museum.

Children and adults alike would stare at the pendulum, meditating on its motion and meaning. One morning in 1998, before the museum had opened, the cable snapped, sending the massive bob hurtling towards the floor, narrowly missing a staffer.

Rather than repair the cable, the museum elected to retire Foucault’s pendulum. Its director at the time decided the device did not have much to do with either America or history, says Liebhold.

The decision divided staffers. “There were pendulum huggers and pendulum haters,” Liebhold says. Pro-pendulum employees said it was cool and fun to watch. The anti-pendulum group believed it didn’t add much to the museum’s efforts to teach the public about American history and culture.

Though Liebhold says he was in the haters’ camp, he believes pendulums have their place, just elsewhere. A pendulum “makes the masses more trusting of the power of science,” he says.

Thompson agrees, and notes that while the pendulum is no longer needed to prove that the Earth rotates, “it is useful if we can get kids engaged in science.”",mainstream,M168df,flat.earth
892,"Last year, retired Sacramento paramedic and firefighter Jesse Beltran says he visited a dentist for what he thought was a standard procedure. Upon waking nearly four hours later, unbeknownst to Beltran, he believes a Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) chip had been implanted in the rear area of his mouth where the lower and upper jaws connect.

During a November 29 interview, Beltran told this writer, “A recent girlfriend of mine that was associated with law enforcement took me to a dentist that I’d never before visited. Without my consent, the dentist used a very unusual looking syringe and knocked me out for between three and four hours. Since I’d been in the medical field for over 20 years, I’m familiar with syringes, and this large-gauge needle looked like the old-style equipment that military doctors used.”

The horrors got worse during this procedure. Beltran continued his account: “When I regained consciousness three to four hours later, my entire chest was drenched in saliva. Supposedly, I had received two root canals and had two teeth capped. But after visiting a different dentist earlier this year, his X-rays revealed that only one root canal had been performed, and no crowns put in place.”

In an extensive portfolio presented to this newspaper, Beltran provided a series of X-rays and MRI scans that show what appear to be two foreign bodies in the back portion of his mouth. Beltran claims two different doctors have confirmed these results.

When asked if he has experienced any physical afflictions as a result, Beltran replied, “A former Marine told me that similar RFID chips are used by the U.S. military on prisoners in Afghanistan to send and receive information. The device in my mouth is approximately the size of a grain of rice, and depending on the frequencies being transmitted, I undergo nausea, vertigo, hearing loss and swollen glands. Plus, because [I have a] technical background, I can hear a ‘60-cycle whine.’ ”

To clarify this phenomenon, Beltran explained, “This 60-cycle whine is an electrical sound emitted from the device, but with a higher pitch that I hear originating from around my right ear, but not exactly.”

When Beltran visited a local district attorney with his X-rays, he was told, “This was done because of something you know that somebody wants, or they don’t want you to say something.”

The district attorney then told Beltran about S.B. 362, introduced by state senator Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto), which states that “subdermal implantation of RFID chips in the state of California against a person’s consent” is illegal. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed this legislation in 2007.

“Why would there need to be such a law in the first place unless these procedures were already being performed?” asked Beltran.

The obvious question at this point is: Why would someone want to implant an RFID device in Beltran’s mouth? This is where the story gets eerie.

Beltran provided the answer. “In 1991 I was the supervisor for a private ambulance company in Sacramento when we were dispatched to the scene of a high-speed pursuit involving the potential kidnapping of a four-or five-year-old girl,” he said. “The suspect was apprehended and dragged from his car by law enforcement officers and then beaten to death. However, it turned out that the suspect was actually the little girl’s father, and it wasn’t a kidnapping, but a custody issue. So, this child’s father was beaten to death with billy clubs before her very eyes.”

He added: “After I tried to write a report about what I’d witnessed, my supervisor told me to keep my mouth shut or I’d be blacklisted. That’s when the cover-up began.”

Still, why would this incident affect Beltran nearly two decades later to the extent that an invasive medical procedure was perhaps conducted without his knowledge and against his will?

“The motive leads back to me witnessing a murder that now affects the candidates (in a local 2010 sheriff’s election) who were in charge of the cover-up,” he said. “Last year, I emailed one of the candidates and asked: If a law enforcement officer is informed of a murder, are they required to report it? Twenty minutes later I received a phone call from one of the officers associated with the cover-up of this murder. If this information is divulged, it will completely ruin the sheriff’s election [in November 2010]. A colleague has also told me that the sheriff’s department and local FBI are behind what has happened to me.”

Although California politicians such as Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Representative Dan Lungren (D-Calif.) have offered no help, nor has local media, Beltran says TruTV and Jesse Ventura have shown an interest in filming the surgery when the RFID device is removed from his mouth. Beltran has also met with an area district attorney, who has yet to decide whether the crimes committed against him fall under local jurisdiction or that of the USA PATRIOT Act and domestic terrorism.

Top US Senator Assassinated As Obama “Weather War” Plunges World Into Chaos

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

A new report prepared for Prime Minister Putin by Russia’s foreign military intelligence directorate (GRU) states that a former top United States Senator, Ted Stevens, was assassinated this week after he attempted to gather evidence “proving” that President Obama has unleashed America’s devastating “weather weapons” against the World.

As we had previously reported on in our August 3rd report titled “Russia Burns, China Drowns: US To Blame?” Russian research scientist Dr. Andrey Areshev has joined the ranks of International scientists and experts stating their belief that the extreme weather chaos currently battering our Planet is being caused by the Tesla technology based weapons systems directed from ’s High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, otherwise known as HAARP.

Now according to this GRU report, Senator Stevens was approached less than a fortnight ago by his longtime friend and Alaskan bush pilot Theron “Terry” Smith whose son-in-law, Alaskan Air National Guard Major Aaron W. Malone, was killed on July 28th after having his C-17 US Military aircraft “targeted” by a HAARP “Tesla Beam” while in the air over Anchorage, Alaska causing it to crash and explode upon impact killing all aboard. [Note: The Russian translation for “targeted” as used in this report does not assign HARRP blame as it includes an “accidental” verb component.]

Upon Senator Stevens beginning his investigation into HAARP’s causing the crash of the Major Malone’s C-17, this report continues, he enlisted the aid of two powerful power brokers, oil fortune heir William “Bill” Phillips Sr. and former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe.

Phillips was a longtime ally and supporter of Senator Stevens and as the heir to the Phillips Petroleum fortune is said in these reports to have in the past used his vast fortune to privately finance US intelligence “activities” to support his countries efforts to gain access to Global oil reserves.

Phillips had long warned Americans that the does not have any big oil companies. And it’s true: the largest American oil company, Exxon Mobil, is only the 14th largest in the World and is dwarfed by the really big oil companies -- all owned by foreign governments or government- sponsored monopolies -- that dominate the World's oil supply.

With 94% of the World's oil supply locked up by foreign governments, most of which are hostile to the , the relatively puny American oil companies do not have access to enough crude oil to significantly affect the market and help bring prices down. Thus, ExxonMobil, a “small” oil company, buys 90% of the crude oil that it refines for the market from the big players, i.e., mostly-hostile foreign governments.

O’Keefe was the former administrator for the Untied States space agency NASA from 2001-2005, and whose reign included the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster that occurred on February 1, 2003, when upon its reentry into Earth’s atmosphere disintegrated over Texas, and which this report says O’Keefe “always” blamed on HAARP because at the exact time of this tragedy it had begun transmitting in what is called “deep sea communication mode”.

[Note: During the ""Navy Deep-Sea Communication"" operational mode, the shortwave radio pulses are all, with military precision, exactly 6.25 seconds long with either exactly 15 or 30 second spaces between pulses. Those long and short binary spaces in between the pulses are actually the coded message. Something like the dits and dahs of very slow Morse code. In this mode, the power is usually at maximum. Unlike the research mode, which mostly runs at night, the US Navy communication mode can be at any time of the day or night, any month of the year. The transmissions may run continuously for about 10 to 30 hours, or from one to several days.

Following the 9-11 World Trade Center attack, and just minutes after the President declared the highest Defense Condition Four (DefCon4), HAARP began transmitting at highest power for 18 hours in ""deep-sea communication"" mode. This is the only way to communicate the DefCon4 condition and updated battle commands to the US nuclear submarines on station miles deep in the ocean.]

The various transmission ranges of HAARP are important to note, this report says, as “immediately prior” to Senator Stevens plane going down Russian satellites orbiting over the Arctic detected a “powerful” 3.39 megahertz signal emanating from HAARP’s Copper Valley Area, Gakona, Alaska base and “directed” over the region this tragedy occurred in.

According to US news reports Phillips was killed in this crash [photo 2nd left] and O’Keefe is in hospital in critical condition, and with Senator Stevens being killed also means their investigation into HAARP has died along with them.

To the chaos erupting all over the World as the result of Obama’s allowing the use of these catastrophic HAARP “weather weapons” it can only be described as being “biblical” in the apocalyptic destruction it is causing, and which includes:

Ø The greatest heatwave and destructive fires has experienced in over 1,000 years.

Ø The greatest flooding has experienced in over 800 years.

Ø Flooding in so epic the United Nations has named this megadisaster as being worse than the 2004 tsunami that shattered the basin.

Ø Flooding so catastrophic in the death toll is soaring into the thousands.

Ø A heatwave so terrible in it has caused its hospitals to be flooded with over 21,000 heatstroke victims.

Ø A heatwave of unprecedented proportions that has gripped the eastern and southern parts of the this summer and shows no signs of abating.

Ø Temperatures so low in the western that farmers in are now reporting their fruits and vegetables are being destroyed.

Ø A catastrophic drought hitting Africa that has put over 10 million people in immediate danger of starvation death.

Ø A catastrophic winter occurring in South America that has killed in Bolivia alone between 3-6 million fish and thousands of cattle in Brazil, and hundreds of people.

To what is linking these Global weather catastrophes we can read as reported by ’s Channel 4 News science correspondent Tom Clarke who in his video report titled “Turbo-Charged Monsoon Confounds Forecasters” states:

“Normally the jet stream is a giant loop of high speed winds that whip round the upper atmosphere. The jet stream isn't involved in day to day weather - it's too high up - but because it pushes the atmosphere around it's very important in steering large scale weather patterns below.

The stream has split in two. One arm has gone north, another south. The patch in the middle is Russia's drought. A circulating pattern of air has been sitting over Russia for far longer than normal, causing the extreme temperatures and wildfires they've had there.

But what's happening over Pakistan is even stranger. The southern arm of the Jet stream has looped down so far it has crossed over the Himalayas into north western Pakistan. Experts at the Met Office tell me this is very unusual.

And the result is that the fast moving jets stream winds high up has helped suck the warm, wet, monsoon air even faster and higher into the atmosphere - and that has caused rains like no-one can remember. It has turbo charged the monsoon if you like. They're not sure that's ever happened before.”

To HAARP’s ability to affect our Earth’s jet streams we can further read from a report prepared in the 1990’s by the US Air Force and which, in part, states:

“HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program), being constructed for the Air Force and Navy by an ARCO subsidiary, is such a project. Touted as scientific research, HAARP is a thinly disguised project to ""perturb"" the ionosphere with extremely powerful beams of energy to see what military uses it can serve. According to the HAARP RFP, these energy beams will be used to ""control ionospheric processes in such a way as to greatly enhance the performance of C3 systems (or, to deny accessibility to an adversary)."" That sounds like a weapon to this writer. Other such projects go by the code names BIME, RED AIR, CRRES, EXCEDE, CHARGE IV, WISP, ACTIVE, HIPAS, RADC, AIM, etc..

Nuclear bombs exploded in high altitude tests in the late fifties and early sixties by both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. caused weather and jet stream changes that lasted almost 20 years. Do the HAARP heaters offer the same potential as they ""perturb"" the ionosphere? The ionosphere is home to many beneficial natural phenomena among them filtering the sun's harmful rays and reflecting radio waves used for communications. Although not totally understood, the ionosphere also directly effects the weather systems and the jet streams.”

To the reasons for Obama unleashing of HAARP weapons upon our World we had touched on in our August 3rd report “Russia Burns, China Drowns: US To Blame?” and though not conclusive contains:

Ø The catastrophic flooding in and apocalyptic heat and fires in put both of these enemies in the position of having to ask the Americans for food aid as their summer crops are being destroyed on an unprecedented basis.

Ø The epic flooding occurring in is effectively destroying that Nations ability to both feed and defend itself and whom Obama has labeled as one of the Americans number one enemies.

Ø The devastating heat occurring in the United States will enable Obama to push through the US Congress a “Global Warming” tax agenda many believe will be the “final nail” needed to destroy the United States as a major World Power.

To the “unintended consequences” of Obama’s “weather war” against the World we can now only glimpse as the wholesale destruction of summer crops in the Northern Hemisphere is now warned will cause food riots as inflationary pressures upon what little food is left to feed our Planet can very well push us all into Total Global War.

And finally, though we do not know what the outcome of these momentous events will be, it is in our knowing to warn, that above all else, everyone reading these words should make the storing of food their top priority as this Summer of Woe will surely become a Winter of Discontent.

917,"The Earth is a sphere. This is a simple fact that humans have known for thousands of years; it was incontrovertibly confirmed as soon as the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik 1 satellite in 1957 and it went … you know ... around the globe.

Nevertheless, a small but vocal group of people who insist that the world is flat — so-called — have emerged online in recent years, and they seem to be sowing doubt about this most basic aspect of reality. Many flat-Earthers put a great deal of effort into concocting alternative explanations for why the world behaves as if it's round when it's actually flat — even though a spherical Earth clearly fits the observations humans have made about the planet over the last few millennia.

However, if Earth, somehow, were truly flat, it would not behave much like the planet we know today. In fact, humanity (and everything else) would be very, very dead.

Related: Are Flat-Earthers Being Serious?

To shape a cosmic body into a disk (rather than a sphere), you've got to spin it very fast, says David Stevenson, a planetary scientist at Caltech in Pasadena, California. This would, unfortunately, destroy the planet by tearing it into tiny particles. In the 1850s, astronomer James Clerk Maxwell showed mathematically that a solid, disk-like shape isn't a stable configuration in the cosmos, in work he conducted regarding . Maxwell's research predicted that Saturn's rings would be made of lots of small, unconnected particles; he turned out to be right. His math also explains why there are no planet-size disks floating around the galaxy.

To flatten Earth without spinning it very rapidly, you'd need magic, or perhaps a galactic panini press. At any rate, a wouldn't last for long. Within a few hours, the force of gravity would press the planet back into a spheroid. Gravity pulls equally from all sides, which explains why planets are spheres (or nearly so – depending on the speed of a planet's rotation, those forces may work against gravity to create a bit of a bulge at the equator). A stable, solid disk-like Earth just isn’t possible under the actual conditions of gravity, as Maxwell’s math showed.

And once you get rid of gravity, everything about our planet rapidly stops making sense.

The atmosphere? Gone, because it's held to the planet by gravity. Tides? Gone. They're caused by the gravitational pull of the moon, which tugs on the oceans and causes them to subtly bulge out as it swings by.

itself? Also gone, since every explanation of the moon's existence involves gravity. In the most widely accepted scenario, the moon was created when a giant, planet-size body crashed into the early Earth; debris from the crash was captured by Earth's gravity. Another scenario suggests that the moon formed at the same time as Earth did (again, thanks to gravity). Or, Earth's formidable gravity attracted and snagged the traveling hunk of space rock as it went hurtling by.

Gravity is also responsible for , with the densest materials sinking to the core, lighter materials making up the mantle and the lightest materials forming the crust. Without this layered structure, the planet would behave a lot differently. Earth's liquid outer core, for example, acts as a giant, dynamic magnet, which creates the planet's magnetic field. The magnetic field helps protect the planet's atmosphere from the stripping effect of the solar wind, which scraped away Mars' atmosphere after that planet's magnetic field faltered 4 billion years ago.

If the Earth were flat , plate tectonics — the movement of rigid plates that make up the planet's crust — wouldn't work either, says James Davis, a geophysicist at the Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New York City.

""When you do the calculations, just simple calculations like, 'If this plate is moving this much and that plate is moving that much,' you have to do it on a sphere,"" he told Live Science. ""You don't get the right answer [the answer that matches real-world observations] if you assume it's a plane.""

Flat-Earthers spin different explanations for how all these observations could be possible on a flat planet. The problem, Davis says, is that these explanations don't have any basis in mathematics or physical reality. When Maxwell predicted in the 1850s that Saturn's rings were made of lots of small particles, he did so by applying general knowledge of how gravity and rotational forces work. His essay on the subject, in fact, was mostly mathematical equations. Flat-Earth theories don't work that way, Davis says.

The flat-Earth worldview also involves cherry-picking different explanations for different phenomena. In real life, the Earth and the Moon are both round for the same quantifiable reason — gravity. have to invent independent explanations for both, and these independent explanations often contradict one another. This isn’t how scientific theory works, Davis says.

""If we can explain a thousand observations with one theory, a simple theory, that's better than explaining a thousand observations with a thousand theories,"" he said.

But setting all that aside, if the Earth were truly flat, it would mean that the millions of scientists who deny its flatness — and who have done so throughout history — are united in a vast conspiracy for reasons that are flat-out unfathomable. It almost makes the prospect of a galactic panini press look realistic.

1112,"It’s that time of year when ambitious homeowners take to their lawns and roofs to outdo their neighbors in a game of who can overwhelm the local power grid first. Results may vary from lonely candy canes to full-blown holiday light dragons. But whether you go full-throttle or prefer a low-key display of holiday cheer, one thing is now true: NASA is watching.

Scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and Yale University in Connecticut used satellite imagery to track light patterns in 1,200 cities over two and a half years. They found that increased light correlated perfectly with the holiday seasons for Ramadan in the Middle East, as well as Christmas and New Year's Eve worldwide. They also saw variations in how cities and neighborhoods within those cities celebrate these holidays, the team announced this week at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in San Francisco.

""What’s happening during the holidays is our patterns are changing,"" says Miguel Román, a physical scientist at NASA Goddard. In the West, we're staying up late drinking eggnog and going home from work early. ""Those changes in behavior are changes in the locations of demand for energy services."" Understanding such seasonal shifts might ultimately tell us what's driving carbon emissions at a local level.

With hundreds of satellites circling Earth, it might seem easy to snap a picture of exactly what’s down below. But getting really high resolution images has been difficult, especially when homing in on urban environments. In 2011, the Suomi-NPP satellite launched with a fancy schmancy camera aboard. This particular camera has low-light sensors that can pick up on wavelengths from green to infrared and create more intense images. The camera allows Suomi-NPP to take pictures of Earth at around 1am local time every night at very high resolution.

“It’s extremely sensitive. Allowing every single pixel to be overexposed, we can pick the faintest signal like a fishing boat out of the coast of Somalia, as well as very bright signals like volcanic magma on the Big Island of Hawaii,” explains Román.

In 2012, NOAA used the camera to make a composite image of a few months worth of lights at night. To make an image like that, you have to run the raw data through special algorithms, to correct for white noise such as fires, reflective aerosols and moonlight. NASA wanted to be able to do this on a daily basis, so Román started exploring options. To get a baseline, he looked at rural areas with little light pollution and at deserts. But when he took some initial data for Egypt and the Sahara, something looked weird, as if the lights were overly saturated.

“This was happening in urban areas, so we looked into that, and what we realized was that what we were seeing was that the increase in the signal was timing perfectly with the Ramadan calendar,” recalls Román. He emailed urbanization specialists at Yale, and they were intrigued. Sure enough, they found the same spike the next year. Over the next two and half years, the team measured data for three holiday periods: three years of Ramadan in the summer (in this case) and two years of Christmas plus New Years from the week of Thanksgiving to the first week in January. Running the images through a specially designed algorithm, they compared the light signal during these periods to the rest of the year in three geographic areas: the Middle East, North America and the Caribbean.

Snow turned out to be a big problem. Looking at the first round of Christmas data from the central U.S., Román saw a huge spike in Denver in 2012. But it wasn't just Christmas lights, it was lamp light reflecting off fresh snow, so they had to take out most cities north of St. Louis. Still, they were able to pick up on some general trends, and produced maps for the holiday periods.

In 70 cities across the U.S., lights twinkled brighter during Christmas and New Year's, regardless of economic or other factors. ""[It's] tracking this national shared tradition,""says Román. City suburbs in particular showed a 30 to 50 percent increase in lighting intensity, while most urban centers saw a 20 to 30 percent increase. That's likely because a bigger yard means more space for blow-up Santas and glow-in-the-dark reindeer.

In Román's native Puerto Rico, the Christmas pattern emerged as well. Using their algorithm, the researchers were actually able to group together cultural centers of holiday festivals, industrial cities and more rural towns based on the citizens' energy habits. ""[We] are now able to classify cities as a function of the energy behaviors of its inhabitants. Behaviors that are based on the norms, on the identities of a culture,"" explains Román. ""This is way cooler than seeing Christmas lights from space.""

In the Middle East, the lights of major cities burned brighter during the holy month of Ramadan, typically culminating with a peak associated with Eid festivities. Generally, lights increased in the city center with group prayer activities at night and people going to work earlier.

Differences across countries stood out. Saudi Arabia had the most intense Ramadan increase, while the lights of Istanbul were a little weaker. Saudi Arabia is more conservative, while Turkey is more secular. ""Nighttime lights really track the cultural differences between these cities and the countries that host them,"" says Eleanor Stokes, a graduate student at Yale who collaborated on the study. Tel Aviv, notably, had no increase in lighting during the Muslim holy month. And cities in Iraq and Lebanon saw dips in nightime lights, which the researchers link to unreliable electricity. In Syria, decreases in nighttime light in Aleppo and Damascus likely corresponded to political and military unrest. ""These nighttime lights really are in some ways like the EKG of a city,"" says Stokes.

In Egypt, the researchers took a closer look at 20 Cairo neighborhoods and found that poorer areas saw a smaller peak during Ramadan, choosing to leave the lights off for financial or maybe cultural reasons. ""You can see those social and cultural imprints in the energy signatures themselves,"" says Stokes.

The data don’t give them an exact measure of the total energy use on a city block, but the lights do provide a proxy for tracking energy use patterns. “This is the factor that’s most sensitive to human behavior. When people turn on the lights, the next thing they’re going to turn on is the toaster and the heater,” says Román. “It’s those patterns of behavior that we’re trying to see.”

Urban areas account for a huge chunk of energy use and emissions, so the researchers hope to overlay the data with carbon emissions and energy consumption data in the future. ""Carbon dioxide emissions is giving you the when, where and the how much. But it’s not telling you what is driving it,"" says Román. Looking at the lighting data against emissions could help build more localized climate mitigation strategies. Román points out: ""What's going to work in New York City isn't necessarily going to work for Amarillo, Texas.""

In this way, the images provide a lot more than pretty pictures of Earth from space.

708,"According to renowned astrophysicist Professor Stephen Hawking, mankind must leave planet Earth in the next 100 years in order to survive.

In a new BBC series, Prof. Hawking claims that mankind’s time on Earth is running out and that we need to leave our planet if our species wants to survive.

Professor Hawking believes that humans must colonize other worlds within the next 100 years in order to survive several threats that our species faces; climate change, asteroid strikes and even overpopulation and perhaps the most worrisome of all, nuclear strikes.

According to the Telegraph, BBC’s series also aims to discover Britain’s greatest inventor and has asked the public to VOTE on the innovation which has been the most influential in their lives.

Professor Hawking has actively spoken out in the last couple of years about the threats that mankind faces.

From the dangers of Artificial Intelligence, biological warfare, to the threats from outer space, Professor Hawking said that only a “world government” may prevent impending doom.

Mr. Hawking previously commented that humans may lack the skills as a species to stay alive. “I don’t think we will survive another 1,000 years without escaping our fragile planet,” he had said, adding: “I therefore want to encourage public interest in space, and I have been getting my training in early.”

According to the World’s smartest man, our planet is headed towards disaster.

“Although the chance of a disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low, it adds up over time, and becomes a near certainty in the next thousand or ten thousand years,” he said. “However, we will not establish self-sustaining colonies in space for at least the next hundred years, so we have to be very careful in this period.”

Last year Professor Hawking made quite a few predictions and said that chances of an apocalyptic even on Earth are a near certainty.

“Although the chance of disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low, it adds up over time, and becomes a near certainty in the next 1,000 or 10,000 years,” Hawking told the Oxford University Union in November.

“By that time, we should have spread out into space and to other stars, so a disaster on Earth would not mean the end of the human race.”

However, if we are to leave Earth as Professor Hawking suggests, where should we go? Who do you save? Who gets to go to a brand new planet? Who will take us there and who will pay for it all?

Too many questions that can be solved in a period of 100 years, don’t you think?

Efforts to create human colonies on other planets or moon’s in our solar system has already begun, with mastermind Elon Musk already hoping to establish functional settlements on another world in the next few decades through his company SpaceX.

654,"Miley Cyrus is what I call a “barometer artist”. That’s because her act invariably mirrors whatever agenda needs to be pushed by mass media at that particular moment. Indeed, Miley never had her own sound, her own image or her own message. Her entire act was always dictated by her handlers ever since she was a child playing the role of Hannah Montana.

Appropriately enough, Miley recently appeared in an episode of Black Mirror where she played the role of a mind-controlled pop star who has absolutely no control over her career and her message. While her character (named Ashley O) keeps talking about “empowerment” to her fans, she’s actually a heavily medicated slave who does as she’s told by her handlers.

Only a few weeks after the release of that Black Mirror episode, Miley Cyrus unleashes upon the world Mother’s Daughter – an NSFW music video loaded with a bunch of calculated messages aimed a young people. Indeed, the video is essentially an infomercial sponsored by powerful groups, lobbies, and think tanks to propagate specific social messages.

According to media sources, Mother’s Daughter is “a statement made in support of gender equality, freedom and the fight against discrimination and sexual harassment”. Of course, the video was immediately praised by everyone in show business because that’s the agenda right now and nobody can oppose it. Abortions good. Genders bad.

However, there is more to this video than meets the eye. Let’s look at it.

The concept of the video is rather simple: Lots of guest appearances by activists and other people that support a specific agenda. At the center of it all: Miley Cyrus wearing a red latex suit which features a symbolic “accessory”.

Beyond the folk tales, the dentata aptly represents an important aspect of today’s mass media agenda: The weaponization of feminity. It is about using “feminism” (a distorted version of it) for social engineering. It is about turning the female body (with all of its warm, receptive and nurturing qualities) against its own nature. It is about radicalizing sexes and breeding hatred between males and females. It is about turning the sad reality of abortion into some kind of feminist power move.

Throughout the video, lots of messages are flashed on screen. They all have a strange, Orwellian quality to them.

A riot is “a form of civil disorder commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent public disturbance against authority, property or people.” Is every woman truly a riot? Of course not. Some women are warm, gentle and loving people who do not feel the need to be angry at everything. By trying to be “feminists”, these people actually reduce and generalize women to fit their own contrived vision.

This next message is worse.

The message is followed by a shot of a young girl.

So, let’s unpack “virginity is a social construct”. What does that even mean? As seen in past articles such as A Teen Vogue Video Says: “This Idea That the Body Is Either Male or Female is Totally Wrong”, there is a worrying trend in mass media that urges young people to deny verifiable facts to embrace a radical and extreme social agenda.

Here’s an excerpt from an article justifying this line of thinking:

The fact that the video follows “virginity doesn’t exist” with a young girl is weird. Do they believe that children are not virgins?

The video then continues with more strange imagery.

The next message in the video gets spiritual.

The lyrics of the song kind go in the same pseudo-satanic direction as the message above. The first verse goes as follows:

As you might know, hallelujah means “Praise the Lord” and is theologically the highest form of praise one can give to God. Combining this word with “I’m a freak” and “I’ma do ya” is basically a form of disrespect and blasphemy.

In the second verse, we start to understand what kind of psychopath would dream up these kinds of debasing messages.

As seen in my article The Sick, Twisted Messages in “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina”, there’s a clear and evident mass media push to associate witches with feminism.

Throughout the video, this chorus is repeated ad-nauseam:

Miley says that she’s nasty and evil because there’s “something in the water”. That’s an interesting conspiracy theory. Her other theory is that she’s nasty and evil because she’s like her mother. Now that’s an uplifting message for the youth.

Speaking of witch (not a typo), Miley’s mother Tish Cyrus makes an appearance in the video.

The video also features other “guests”.

Is this video celebrating “diversity” or exploiting it? As stated countless times in previous articles, everyone has the absolute right to live in whatever way that makes them happy and comfortable. But there’s a fine line between accepting people and hunting down the most “diverse” people and exploiting them in videos as if they were circus freaks for maximum virtue signaling points.

Here’s what probably happened behind the scenes:

While clamoring “inclusivity”, videos like this one actually reduces people to attributes such as “trans” or “disabled”.

This final image sums up the entire video.

Does this image convey power? Or the exact opposite? Miley sits on a carousel horse that is meant to go around in circles. She wears fake studio props as an armor. Miley is not leading anyone anywhere. She’s a highly controlled pop star in a studio who is taking orders from a director (who is a white male, by the way).

The chorus might say “Don’t f*ck with my freedom”. However, those who own her never gave her any of it.

Mother’s Daughter is not art. It is propaganda and indoctrination. In only a few short minutes, this video manages to mix the occult elite’s obsession with abortions, gender-blurring, and satanism. Let’s not forget the fact that they believe that virginity is a “social construct”.

In the end, behind all of the virtue signaling and the buzzwords, this video actually celebrates only one thing: The corruption of everything that is pure and sacred.

The 2D propagation scenario is completed by choosing the appropriate transverse and longitudinal BC. This problem has analytical exact solutions in terms of Airy functions for the range independent vertical refractive index.

She added that ""it would be appropriate for the University of Chicago, which is the publisher of the Journal of Political Economy, to review Uhlig's performance and suitability to continue as editor."".

Yellen declined further comment. Uhlig and the journal did not respond to emails.

626,"Under the circumstances, it was the best possible gesture of public support that Washington could offer its diminutive Baltic ally. Better still was the timing. Ilves ended up in the Oval Office on 25 June, exactly one week before US President George W. Bush would host Vladimir Putin in Kennebunkport, Maine. The symbolism – Estonia first, Russia second – was not overlooked in the Baltic state. As Ilves said to Estonians, the invitation proved that membership of NATO and the EU was not just a series of empty obligations and formalities. “If we help others, then they will help us,” Ilves said.

True enough, but it is difficult to imagine that the White House would have acted similarly had Ilves’s predecessor, Arnold Rüütel, aged 78, still been president. Rüütel, a stodgy ex-communist who brought precious few ideas to the job, never had the erudition and aplomb that Ilves possesses in abundance.

Ilves and Bush first met in November 2006, just a month-and-a-half after Ilves (the name means ‘lynx’ in Estonian) was inaugurated, during the US president’s stopover in Tallinn en route to the NATO summit in Riga, Latvia. Judging by all accounts, the man from Texas took an instant liking to the man who was a teenage immigrant to New Jersey.

So come April, when Estonia erupted in two nights of rioting that left one dead and more than a hundred wounded and caused extensive property damage, Bush remembered his new friend in the Baltics.

And how could he not? The loquacious Ilves, who, as well as English, also has a command of German and Spanish, always leaves a favourable impression. Listening to him is a treat. He wields a wonderful mix of intellectual insights and down-to-earth wisdom seldom found in public officials. Speaking on Ukraine’s incessant woes, for instance, he is quick to point out that the crucial mistake was made in the early 1990s by the then president Leonid Kravchuk when the latter refused to co-operate with a diaspora of three million Ukrainians living in North America. By shutting the door on such potential expertise and investment, Kravchuk all but slammed the door to possible Western integration in his own face.

Ilves would know. A son of Estonian refugees, he was born in Stockholm in 1953. When he was thirteen his family moved to the US, where Toomas Hendrik (he always uses both first and middle names) later graduated from Columbia University (BA) and the University of Pennsylvania (MA) with degrees in psychology. In 1984 he packed his bags and left for Munich to work as an analyst with Radio Free Europe, and nine years later he returned stateside – only this time as ambassador to United States, Canada and Mexico for a newly independent Estonia. Of his own background, Ilves has said: “I speak English like an American, I think like a European.”

Remarkably, as a member of the European Parliament from April 2004 to September 2006 he was tireless in using these two sides of his persona to bridge the transatlantic rift after the invasion of Iraq. He blasted Donald Rumsfeld’s ‘Old Europe’ paradigm as a “disaster,” and when German philosopher Jürgen Habermas and the late French deconstructionist Jacques Derrida published a joint declaration calling on Europeans to unite under a banner of anti-Americanism, Ilves wrote a lengthy, passionate rebuttal. Recalling that heady year of 2003, he said, “There was too much hysteria on both sides of the Atlantic.”

Ilves eventually gave up his US citizenship to become Estonia’s foreign minister in 1996. In more than a decade of domestic Estonian politics, he has stood steadfastly in the centre of the political spectrum as a member of the Moderates, a party that he helped create. Thanks to Ilves’s friendship with Mart Laar, a former prime minister, Estonia was the first European nation to introduce the flat tax. In 2004 the Moderates became the Social Democratic Party, which Ilves left after becoming president.

A striking trait of Ilves is his versatility. He loves the rustic life and enjoys sporting a pair of overalls and tilling the soil at his farmstead in Arma, just a short walk from the Latvian-Estonian border. Film is another favorite pastime. Recently he even tried his talents at acting, taking a cameo role in ‘186 Kilometers’ an Estonian picture about an out-of-luck actor who runs into sundry difficulties trying to make what should be a simple journey from Tallinn to Tartu, a university town southeast of the capital.

In one of Ilves’s charity drives, a few years ago he was asked to help raise money for disabled children by participating in a benefit concert. Ilves agreed and put on a small performance reminiscent of the Blues Brothers, going so far as to don the black fedora and sunglasses. During the European Parliament ballot in 2004, however, his political opponents from Res Publica, a right-wing startup, used this image of Ilves on its posters to scare the Estonian electorate into believing that the Chicago mob was threatening to overrun the Baltic state. The media campaign, which Ilves slammed as “vicious” and “slimy,” backfired, and the Social Democrats won the most votes, walking away with three of Estonia’s six seats in the EU legislature. The ‘mobster’ himself was appointed deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee.

Two-and-a-half years later, Ilves, who actually prefers bow-ties, was further vindicated when Res Publica, which bitterly opposed a second presidential term for Rüütel, threw its support behind his candidacy.

For now, Ilves, who will celebrate his first year in office on 9 October, faces tremendous domestic challenges. After the Soviet memorial debacle in April, Estonian society is deeply split – one-quarter of the country’s 1.3 million are ethnic Russians. Given the current labour deficit, keeping the Russians – many of whom are non-citizens without the right to vote in national elections – is a matter of economic urgency. Tellingly, Ilves’s first domestic trip after becoming president was to Narva and Ida-Virumaa, towns in northeastern Estonia that are more than 90% ethnic Russian.

The appeal is also directed at Estonians. Demographics, after all, will be the country’s single greatest challenge in the 21st century. While in New York in September, Ilves appealed to Estonians living in the US to think about returning to the Baltics. “We need every Estonian,” he said.

701,"What is time? It ticks by, moment by moment, day after day. But it’s so baked into our lives that we don’t think much about it, unless we’re late for an appointment or suddenly notice those gray hairs in the mirror.

Then the physicists weigh in, and time suddenly seems more complicated. Einstein tells us that it can expand and shrink, while the second law of thermodynamics, which says that the universe is growing more disordered, seems somehow to be tied to time’s “flow.”

Carlo Rovelli has devoted most of his career to pondering the enigma of time. An Italian physicist working at Aix-Marseille University in France, Rovelli is known among scientists for his pioneering work on loop quantum gravity — a theory that attempts to unite quantum mechanics with Einstein’s theory of general relativity. The wider public, meanwhile, has come to know him as an eloquent, even poetic writer on scientific topics.

Rovelli’s 2014 book, ""Seven Brief Lessons on Physics,"" sold more than a million copies around the world. Now he’s out with a new book, ""The Order of Time,"" which zeroes in on that most peculiar dimension: time.

Recently, MACH spoke with Rovelli about the nature of time, whether it has a beginning and if humans might one day master time travel. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

MACH: What exactly is time?

Rovelli: It is something very complex. We mistakenly think that time is something basic, something very elementary. We imagine it ticking away the life of the cosmos, in a succession of instants. This understanding of time is wrong. Or at least, it’s an approximation of a far more complex reality.

This doesn’t mean that the layperson’s understanding of time is an illusion. It only means that it holds up in a limited way. It’s like thinking that the Earth is flat. As long as we move in a small region [on the Earth’s surface], we can very well consider it to be flat. When we build a house, for example, we don’t need to bother with the curvature of the surface of the Earth. But if we look at a larger scale, then definitely the Earth is not flat.

It’s the same with time. Our everyday intuition of it works very well, but only as long as we don’t look too far out into space or too deeply into small distances, and only if we don’t consider things moving at high speeds.

What does physics have to say about the “flow” of time that humans seem to feel?

It may not be a physics problem. I think it depends on our brains and the complicated way in which we form memories. It has to do with how we remember the past and anticipate the future. So to explain this passage of time, this flowing of time, I believe one should look at neuroscience, not physics.

What do physicists see as the biggest unanswered question about time?

The biggest of the open questions is: Why is the future so different from the past? This is something that is not written into the laws of physics — the fundamental laws of physics don’t distinguish the past from the future. This is still something mysterious, I believe.

Where does the second law of thermodynamics fit in?

Think of a film of one billiard ball hitting another. The film looks the same forward as backward. It’s the same with the moon orbiting the Earth, or the Earth going around the sun. But this time-symmetry breaks down with complex systems, where you can see the amount of disorder increasing.

Like a teacup breaking, or an egg getting scrambled?

Right. This increase in disorder is the second law of thermodynamics. The mysterious part is not so much that things get disordered; of course, things get disordered. The mysterious part is, why were they ordered in the past? Who ordered them in the past?

How far into the past should we look for an answer?

We’re pretty confident that the universe started off with the Big Bang. We don’t know what happened just before; that’s still very much debated. We know that things have been getting more and more disordered since the Big Bang. The whole 14-billion-year history of the universe has been like a deck of cards that’s been shuffled over and over again, always becoming more disordered. But it’s a puzzle, because the Big Bang — this initial, compressed, hot phase of the universe — doesn’t seem to have been very ordered. Yet somehow it must have been. So what was the source of this initial order? That is still an open question.

We don’t know. For a while, it seemed reasonable to think that time “began” 13.8 billion years ago, with the Big Bang. But today many scientists are doubting this idea and considering the possibility that the universe existed before the Big Bang. All options are open.

Could time travel ever be possible?

Well, “time traveling” is what we do all our lives, isn’t it? But you mean, can we jump quickly to the past or to the future. Jumping to the far future is certainly possible. It’s only a technological problem, not a scientific one.

One way is to move very fast. When you move fast, time passes very slowly for you — so if you could run fast enough around your house many times, you could do that in a time span which for you is a couple of minutes, but in the meanwhile centuries pass for everyone else. The only difficulty is that the speed needed for this has to be very high, comparable to the speed of light.

Another way to jump to the future is to travel near a black hole. Near a black hole, time slows down. So a starship could wait there for half an hour and then move away from the black hole, and find itself millennia in the future.

What about traveling back in time?

That’s much more complicated. It is not logically impossible, but it requires beating the second law of thermodynamics, which would be like beating the laws of probability. I think that if we ever achieve this, it would be long after we’ve mastered forward time travel.

Has working as a physicist affected the way you think about time in your own life?

I’ve certainly changed a lot, in my way of thinking, over the years. But I’m not sure if it’s because of my research or because I’m getting older. I’m much more relaxed. I’m much more serene, less rushed. I think of life more as a gift. But possibly it’s just because I was 20 before, and I’m 60 now. Life looks different from this perspective.

'Tis the season for holiday parties at the office.

While they're great for building workplace camaraderie and team spirit, when was the last time a colleague — perhaps fueled by too much alcohol — said something so ridiculous that it made your jaw drop? Perhaps a desk mate went into something political, claiming that George Bush is behind 9/11 or that Barack Obama is a Muslim from Kenya? Or maybe your boss voiced science denialism, arguing that the Earth is flat or the Apollo moon landing was faked?

Just as disconcerting as the conspiracy theorist in your midst is hearing a boss or colleague blatantly deny a business reality, such as evidence that a favored product flopped or a decision was absolutely the wrong one.

So what do you do when someone you work with — even the CEO of the company — tells you something that's demonstrably false?

Dealing with truth denialism — in business, politics and other life areas — is one of my areas of research, and I recently published a book on the topic. Here are some tips to navigate that Christmas office party or one-on-one with a boss in denial.

It begins at the top

The worst-case scenario is when your chief executive is the one in denial.

A four-year study by LeadershipIQ.com, which provides online leadership seminars, interviewed 1,087 board members from 286 organizations of all sorts that forced out their chief executive officers. It found that almost one quarter of CEOs — 23 percent — got fired for denying reality, meaning refusing to recognize negative facts about the organization's performance.

Other research strongly suggests that the behaviors expressed by CEOs ""are felt throughout the organization by impacting the norms that sanction or discourage member behavior and decision making, and the patterns of behavior and interaction among members.""

Together, these findings suggest that organizations where CEOs deny negative facts will have a culture of denying reality throughout the hierarchy. Of course, even when the boss lives in the real world, others in the organization may hold false beliefs.

Professionals at all levels can suffer from the tendency to deny uncomfortable facts in business settings. Scholars term this thinking error the ostrich effect, named after the (mythical) notion that ostriches stick their heads into the sand when they see threats.

Our intuition is to confront colleagues suffering from the ostrich effect with the facts.

But research — and common sense, if the colleague is your supervisor — suggests that's usually the wrong thing to do. That's because when someone believes something we know to be false, some kind of emotional block is probably at play. A number of factors explain why this happens.

For example, research on confirmation bias shows that we tend to look for and interpret information in ways that conforms to our beliefs. So even if sales are far below expectations, a CEO might reject that information in projecting good financial forecasts on the belief that his actions should lead the company to do well.

In another example at a company where I consulted, a manager refused to acknowledge that a person hired directly by her was a bad fit, despite everyone else in the department telling me that the employee was holding back the team. The manager's behavior likely resulted from what scholars term the sunk cost fallacy, a tendency to double down on past decisions even when an objective assessment shows the decision to be problematic.

In both cases, facing facts would cause the CEO or the manager to feel bad. We often prefer to stick our heads into the sand rather than acknowledge our fault because of our reluctance to experience negative emotions.

Research on a phenomenon called the backfire effect shows we tend to dig in our heels when we are presented with facts that cause us to feel bad about our identity, self-worth, worldview or group belonging. In some cases, presenting the facts actually backfires, causing people to develop a stronger attachment to incorrect beliefs. Moreover, we express anger at the person bringing us the message, a phenomenon researchers term ""shoot the messenger.""

There are many other mental errors that inhibit business professionals from seeing reality clearly and making good decisions.

This isn't to say that emotions are the problem. They are not.

Emotions are fundamentally important to the human experience, and we need both reason and emotion to make good decisions.

So rather than offering facts, your goal should be to show emotional leadership and try to figure out what are the emotional blocks inhibiting your colleague from seeing reality clearly. To do so, use curiosity and subtle questioning to figure out their values and goals and how they shape their perception of self-identity. And focus on deploying the emotional intelligence skill of empathy.

Unfortunately, despite extensive research about the importance of emotional intelligence in professional settings, too many organizations still fail to provide such training.

Once you understand your colleague's goals and values, try to show you share them.

Research shows doing so is crucial to conveying knowledge effectively in professional environments. Practice mirroring, or rephrasing in your own words the points made by the other person, which demonstrates you understand how they feel and helps build trust.

With a CEO, you might talk about how both of you share a desire for the executive to be a truly strong leader. Try to connect the traits and emotions identified by the CEO to specific examples of his behavior.

And regarding the manager with the problematic employee, I had a conversation about how she saw her current and potential future employees playing a role in the long-term future of the department she ran. I echoed her anxiety about the company's financial performance and concerns about getting funding for future hires, which gave me an additional clue into why she might be protecting the incompetent employee.

After placing yourself on the same side, building up trust and establishing an emotional connection, move on to the problem at hand: their emotional block.

The key here is to show them, without arousing a defensive or aggressive response, how their current truth denialism undermines their own goals in the long term. It can help to cite a prominent example of a business leader accepting difficult facts to move forward, such as how former Ford CEO Alan Mulally helped save the company through repeated course corrections. Research shows that offering positive reinforcement, without condescension, can be effective with colleagues and bosses alike.

So when you're at your next office party and encounter a truth-denying colleague, remember these tips and perhaps you won't have to spend the evening with your face buried in your hands.",mainstream,M09436,flat.earth
1088,"The climate model Fast Ocean Atmosphere Model (FOAM) comprises an atmosphere and ocean component that are coupled to each other31. Although simplified to run a large number of simulated years per day, it is a complex climate model that solves time-dependent equations describing the fluid and thermodynamics of the system. FOAM is a coupled general circulation model, meaning that it uses different circulation models for various aspects of the simulation. The Community Climate Model CCM3 is used to simulate the atmospheric components of the planet, whereas the Modular Ocean Model OM3 is used to simulate the dynamics of the ocean. The two components are coupled, meaning that the transfer of heat and moisture at the boundary is calculated, as well as the distribution of any sea ice. Although the dynamics of the sea ice is not included in FOAM, other studies have examined how the inclusion of sea-ice dynamics changes the ability of a model to initiate Snowball Earth33,34,35. In particular, when polar ice caps become large, they flow under the influence of gravity, facilitating the advance of the ice front equatorward. This result means that Snowball-Earth conditions would onset at a lower value of methane concentration for models with sea-ice dynamics than for those without. In our simulations, which are heavily abstracted, this effect does not change the qualitative conclusion that the topography of the Earth (or more specifically, the albedo) affects the onset of Snowball Earth.

FOAM splits the atmosphere into 18 vertical levels, each with a depth in units of pressure of 55 hPa. The atmosphere has 40 latitudinal and 48 longitudinal grid points. The ocean model has a higher resolution, with 128 latitudinal and longitudinal grid points with a maximum of 20 vertical levels depending on the chosen ocean depth. These levels are not equally spaced, with the first 14 levels making up the top 1500 m of the ocean. For simplicity, the ocean depth is set to a constant value of 3100 m, one of the fixed depths available in the ocean model. This depth is similar to the average ocean depth on present-day Earth. The flat continent had a constant elevation of 20 m above sea level. The area of the oceans and continents does not change when water from the oceans is removed to form ice sheets on land. The depth of the continental ice sheets does not affect the continental topography.

For simplicity, our simulations share the same orbital characteristics (i.e., orbital rotation rate, eccentricity, obliquity, date of perihelion) as the present day, with the exception of a 360-day year. The solar constant is set to the predicted solar luminosity 2.4 billion years ago of 1100 W m−2, 19% lower than the present-day value8.

To compensate for this lower solar constant, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was higher than the present-day values10. Greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane have been hypothesised to have created a strong greenhouse effect on early Earth. This experiment assumes that carbon dioxide is the largest contributor to this warming. One possible range of carbon dioxide concentrations during the Proterozoic is 4000 to 80,000 ppmv38. A value of 10,000 ppmv is chosen, a number within this range and also used in another study17. The range of atmospheric methane concentration to test over was decided based on estimates10 and the results of modelling17. This range is 1–100 ppmv.

The size and location of the continents 2.4 billion years ago is uncertain. One plausible reconstruction places a supercontinent close to the equator, with a larger meridional dimension than zonal one25. Another constructed simulation from the PaleoProterozoic glaciation used a similar series of continents17. A box containing the entire supercontinent occupies about 15% of Earth’s total surface area. To replicate this, a rectangular continent (on a latitude–longitude map projection) centred on the equator that is 15.6% of the total surface area is used in this experiment. This continent extends from 56°N to 56°S, and has a west–east width of 68° longitude. The continent surface type is set to desert rock, which has an albedo of 24%39, replicating the plant-less continent surface of 2.4 billion years ago. The elevation of the continent is 20 m above sea level.

Little information is available about the topography of this supercontinent, and so we experiment with a number of hypothetical sets of mountain ranges at various latitudes (Fig. 1). They are all placed parallel to latitude lines, and the pairs are placed the same distance from the equator in each hemisphere. The mountains are approximately Gaussian in profile, have a latitudinal width of 10 grid points, which is equivalent to about 1550 m (14° latitude) at the equator, and each mountain spans the entire longitudinal dimension of the continent. The mountain dimensions are restricted by the 128 × 128 grid boxes, which limits how gradual the slope of the mountains can be, but they have a maximum height of 3000 m. A suite of model simulations varying the maximum height of the mountains using the M40 and M50 configurations showed no sensitivity to the onset of the Snowball Earth for mountain heights between 0.5 and 3.0 km. Such results are consistent with those where we vary the albedo of flat terrain at low latitudes and show that the effect of the albedo on climate is greater than the effect of the terrain on climate.

The simulations are performed in a time-slice experiment where the model is initialised and then run until it reaches equilibrium. Each simulation is initialised with the conditions of the present climate. The polar surface temperature is set to 10 °C and the equatorial temperature to 28 °C. The conditions being tested cannot maintain such a high surface temperature, and so the system evolves to a new, colder state. The state that the system ends up in primarily depends on the tested value of methane. Simulations are run for a total of 400 years to give the climate enough time to evolve to its new state. But, this time is not sufficient to produce ice sheets of substantial depth to rival the height of the mountain range or reach the stage where the ice would flow a substantial distance due to gravity (which could not be modeled in FOAM anyway). Thirty-day mean values are output from the model 12 times each model year. These data describe the monthly-mean state of the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere (ice and snow) for that year.

In addition to the 49 simulations performed in the study, 40 other simulations were performed with a continent comprising 27% of the area of the Earth (comparable to modern values), solar constant of 1142 W m−2 and a carbon dioxide concentration of 2000 ppm. Methane was varied from 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 2400, and 2600 ppm. These simulations show a similar sensitivity to that presented in the present article.",mainstream,M0a54a,flat.earth

377,"China's first moon rover has touched the lunar surface and left deep traces on its loose soil, state media reported on Sunday, several hours after the country successfully carried out the world's first soft landing of a space probe on the moon in nearly four decades.The 140-kilogram (300-pound) ""Jade Rabbit"" rover separated from the much larger landing vehicle early Sunday, around seven hours after the unmanned Chang'e 3 space probe touched down on a fairly flat, Earth-facing part of the moon.State broadcaster China Central Television showed images taken from the lander's camera of the rover and its shadow moving down a sloping ladder and touching the surface, setting off applause in the Beijing control center. It said the lander and rover, both bearing Chinese flags, would take photos of each other on Sunday evening.Later, the six-wheeled rover will survey the moon's geological structure and surface and look for natural resources for three months, while the lander will carry out scientific explorations at the landing site for one year.The mission marks the next stage in an ambitious space program that aims to eventually put a Chinese astronaut on the moon. China's space program is an enormous source of pride for the country, the third to carry out a lunar soft landing - which does not damage the craft and the equipment it carries - after the United States and the former Soviet Union. The last one was by the Soviet Union in 1976.""It's still a significant technological challenge to land on another world,"" said Peter Bond, consultant editor for Jane's Space Systems and Industry. ""Especially somewhere like the moon, which doesn't have an atmosphere so you can't use parachutes or anything like that. You have to use rocket motors for the descent and you have to make sure you go down at the right angle and the right rate of descent and you don't end up in a crater on top of a large rock.""On Saturday evening, CCTV showed a computer-generated image of the Chang'e 3 lander's path as it approached the surface of the moon, saying that during the landing period it needed to have no contact with Earth. As it was just hundreds of meters (yards) away, the lander's camera broadcast images of the moon's surface.The Chang'e 3's solar panels, which are used to absorb sunlight to generate power, opened soon after the landing.The mission blasted off from southwest China on Dec. 2 on a Long March-3B carrier rocket. It is named after a mythical Chinese goddess of the moon and the ""Yutu"" rover, or ""Jade Rabbit"" in English, is the goddess' pet.China's military-backed space program has made methodical progress in a relatively short time, although it lags far behind the United States and Russia in technology and experience.China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, becoming the third nation after Russia and the United States to achieve manned space travel independently. In 2006, it sent its first probe to the moon. China plans to open a space station around 2020 and send an astronaut to the moon after that.""They are taking their time with getting to know about how to fly humans into space, how to build space stations ... how to explore the solar system, especially the moon and Mars,"" Bond said. ""They are making good strides, and I think over the next 10-20 years they'll certainly be rivaling Russia and America in this area and maybe overtaking them in some areas.""",mainstream,M1531c,flat.earth

Members of the Flat Earth Society claim to believe the Earth is flat. Walking around on the planet's surface, it looks and feels flat, so they deem all evidence to the contrary, such as satellite photos of Earth as a sphere, to be fabrications of a ""round Earth conspiracy"" orchestrated by NASA and other government agencies.

The belief that the Earth is flat has been described as the ultimate conspiracy theory. According to the Flat Earth Society's leadership, its ranks have grown by 200 people (mostly Americans and Britons) per year since 2009. Judging by the exhaustive effort flat-earthers have invested in fleshing out the theory on their website, as well as the staunch defenses of their views they offer in media interviews and on Twitter, it would seem that these people genuinely believe the Earth is flat.

But in the 21st century, can they be serious? And if so, how is this psychologically possible?

First, a brief tour of the worldview of a flat-earther: While writing off buckets of concrete evidence that Earth is spherical, they readily accept a laundry list of propositions that some would call ludicrous. The leading flat-earther theory holds that Earth is a disc with the Arctic Circle in the center and Antarctica, a 150-foot-tall wall of ice, around the rim. NASA employees, they say, guard this ice wall to prevent people from climbing over and falling off the disc. (In keeping with their skepticism of NASA, known flat-earther conspiracy theorist Nathan Thompson recently approached a man he said was a NASA employee in a Starbucks in mid-May 2017. In a YouTube video of the exchange, Thompson, founder of the Official Flat Earth and Globe Discussion page, shouted that he had proof the Earth is flat — apparently saying an astronaut drowning was that proof — and that NASA is ""lying."")

Earth's day and night cycle is explained by positing that the sun and moon are spheres measuring 32 miles (51 kilometers) that move in circles 3,000 miles (4,828 km) above the plane of the Earth. (Stars, they say, move in a plane 3,100 miles up.) Like spotlights, these celestial spheres illuminate different portions of the planet in a 24-hour cycle. Flat-earthers believe there must also be an invisible ""antimoon"" that obscures the moon during lunar eclipses.

Furthermore, Earth's gravity is an illusion, they say. Objects do not accelerate downward; instead, the disc of Earth accelerates upward at 32 feet per second squared (9.8 meters per second squared), driven up by a mysterious force called dark energy. Currently, there is disagreement among flat-earthers about whether or not Einstein's theory of relativity permits Earth to accelerate upward indefinitely without the planet eventually surpassing the speed of light. (Einstein's laws apparently still hold in this alternate version of reality.)

As for what lies underneath the disc of Earth, this is unknown, but most flat-earthers believe it is composed of ""rocks."" [Religion and Science: 6 Visions of Earth's Core]

Then, there's the conspiracy theory: Flat-earthers believe photos of the globe are photoshopped; GPS devices are rigged to make airplane pilots think they are flying in straight lines around a sphere when they are actually flying in circles above a disc. The motive for world governments' concealment of the true shape of the Earth has not been ascertained, but flat-earthers believe it is probably financial. ""In a nutshell, it would logically cost much less to fake a space program than to actually have one, so those in on the Conspiracy profit from the funding NASA and other space agencies receive from the government,"" the flat-earther website's FAQ page explains.

Who believes the Earth is flat?

Flat-earth believers are not relegated to the hidden corners of the universe: Plenty of celebs have been quite vocal with their beliefs. For instance, on Jan. 25, 2016, rapper-singer Bobby Ray Simmons Jr. (known as B.o.B) released a track called ""Flatline"" in which he disses astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, after the two had a Twitter battle over the spherical-ness of the planet. B.o.B is convinced Earth is flat. A day earlier, the rapper tweeted: ""No matter how high in elevation you are... the horizon is always eye level ... sorry cadets... I didn't wanna believe it either.""

And then there's Shaq. In a podcast that aired on Feb. 27, 2017, former NBA player Shaquille O'Neal proclaimed our home planet is flat, saying that when he drives from Florida to California ""it's flat to me."" Shaq later said he was just kidding. [5 Scientific Rebuttals of Shaq's Flat-Earth Claims]

Some believers have gotten creative in their quest to prove a flat planet: Conspiracy theorist D. Marble posted on YouTube on May 1, 2017, that he brought a spirit level aboard a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina to Seattle, Washington, to see whether the plane's nose would dip to ""compensate for curvature"" of the Earth, he said. On the video, he said: ""I recorded a 23 minute and 45 second time-lapse, which by those measurements means the plane travelled a little over 203 miles. According to Spherical Trigonometry given to explain the Heliocentric model, this should have resulted in the compensation of 5 miles of curvature. As you'll see there was no measurable compensation for curvature."" (The air bubble in his level remained centered, which he said proves the Earth is flat.)

The theory follows from a mode of thought called the ""Zetetic Method,"" an alternative to the scientific method, developed by a 19th-century flat-earther, in which sensory observations reign supreme. ""Broadly, the method places a lot of emphasis on reconciling empiricism and rationalism, and making logical deductions based on empirical data,"" Flat Earth Society vice president Michael Wilmore, an Irishman, told Life's Little Mysteries. In Zetetic astronomy, the perception that Earth is flat leads to the deduction that it must actually be flat; the antimoon, NASA conspiracy and all the rest of it are just rationalizations for how that might work in practice.

Those details make the flat-earthers' theory so elaborately absurd it sounds like a joke, but many of its supporters genuinely consider it a more plausible model of astronomy than the one found in textbooks. In short, they aren't kidding. [50 Amazing Facts About Planet Earth]

""The question of belief and sincerity is one that comes up a lot,"" Wilmore said. ""If I had to guess, I would probably say that at least some of our members see the Flat Earth Society and Flat Earth Theory as a kind of epistemological exercise, whether as a critique of the scientific method or as a kind of 'solipsism for beginners.' There are also probably some who thought the certificate would be kind of funny to have on their wall. That being said, I know many members personally, and I am fully convinced of their belief.""

Wilmore counts himself among the true believers. ""My own convictions are a result of philosophical introspection and a considerable body of data that I have personally observed, and which I am still compiling,” he said.

Strangely, Wilmore and the society's president, a 35-year-old Virginia-born Londoner named Daniel Shenton, both think the evidence for global warming is strong, despite much of this evidence coming from satellite data gathered by NASA, the kingpin of the ""round Earth conspiracy."" They also accept evolution and most other mainstream tenets of science.

As inconceivable as their belief system seems, it doesn't really surprise experts. Karen Douglas, a psychologist at the University of Kent in the United Kingdom who studies the psychology of conspiracy theories, says flat-earthers' beliefs cohere with those of other conspiracy theorists she has studied.

""It seems to me that these people do generally believe that the Earth is flat. I'm not seeing anything that sounds as if they're just putting that idea out there for any other reason,"" Douglas told Live Science.

She said all conspiracy theories share a basic thrust: They present an alternative theory about an important issue or event, and construct an (often) vague explanation for why someone is covering up that ""true"" version of events. ""One of the major points of appeal is that they explain a big event but often without going into details,"" she said. ""A lot of the power lies in the fact that they are vague.""

The self-assured way in which conspiracy theorists stick to their story imbues that story with special appeal. After all, flat-earthers are more adamant that the Earth is flat than most people are that the Earth is round (probably because the rest of us feel we have nothing to prove). ""If you're faced with a minority viewpoint that is put forth in an intelligent, seemingly well-informed way, and when the proponents don't deviate from these strong opinions they have, they can be very influential. We call that minority influence,"" Douglas said.

In a study published online March 5, 2014, in the American Journal of Political Science, Eric Oliver and Tom Wood, political scientists at the University of Chicago, found that about half of Americans endorse at least one conspiracy theory, from the notion that 9/11 was an inside job to the JFK conspiracy. ""Many people are willing to believe many ideas that are directly in contradiction to a dominant cultural narrative,"" Oliver told Live Science. He says conspiratorial belief stems from a human tendency to perceive unseen forces at work, known as magical thinking. [Top 10 Unexplained Phenomena]

However, flat-earthers don't fit entirely snugly in this general picture. Most conspiracy theorists adopt many fringe theories, even ones that contradict each other. Meanwhile, flat-earthers' only hang-up is the shape of the Earth. ""If they were like other conspiracy theorists, they should be exhibiting a tendency toward a lot of magical thinking, such as believing in UFOs, ESP, ghosts, the Devil, or other unseen, intentional forces,"" Oliver wrote in an email. ""It doesn't sound like they do, which makes them very anomalous relative to most Americans who believe in conspiracy theories.""

451,"Ever since the coronavirus spread across the world, suspicions have proliferated about what is really going on. Questions arose about the origins of the virus, the way it makes people sick, the mitigation measures taken, the suspended civil rights, the connection with 5G, possible cures and medications, and about the role of Bill Gates in it all.

These ideas are commonly framed as conspiracy theories. Yes, they may all distrust the mainstream narrative and share certain characteristics, but they are not one of a kind.

They take so many different forms and have such varying degrees of plausibility that I question how useful it is to bracket them all under the same banner. To understand and effectively respond to the various coronavirus conspiracy theories, we need to dig deeper.

Listen to our Expert guide to conspiracy theories, a series by The Conversation’s The Anthill podcast.

The dominant explanation for the popularity of coronavirus conspiracy theories is remarkably similar: these dark and unsettling ideas help people make sense of a complex and uncertain world. They provide sufficiently large explanations for tragic events, and give back feelings of agency and control.

Since these ideas sometimes have real-world consequences, from 5G masts set on fire to ignoring coronavirus mitigation measures, various commentators condemn these conspiracy theories. Officials now need not only fight a health pandemic, so their story goes, but an infodemic too.

The problem with the generalising approach is threefold. It does not account for the motivations of conspiracy theorists themselves; nor for the different forms and plausibility of the various conspiracy theories; nor for their relations with various political and societal issues.

Providing uniform explanations for conspiracy theories fails to seriously consider their contents or underlying concerns. Similarly, it leaves untouched how certain conspiracy theories are weaponised in various propaganda wars.

A closer look at these theories or – even better – actual engagement with the people propagating them, shows conspiracy theories not so much as a uniform coping strategy in unsettling times, but rather as a wide array of cultural expressions.

These include suspicions of planned efforts to impose mass vaccinations, doubts about the origins of the virus, expressions of disgust for the ruling elite, geopolitical insinuations, pointers to an inflated media panic, the scapegoating of certain societal groups (Chinese or Jews), critiques on the methods and measurements of COVID-19 symptoms and deaths, discontents with powerful philanthropists, worries about the expansion of authoritarian government policies, or concerns about corporate intrusion in the search for effective medications.

This means, as I argue in my recent book, that we need to focus on the meaning, diversity and context of different conspiracy theories, as well as the people who subscribe to them.

During my ethnographic research projects on contemporary conspiracy cultures, I encountered a wide variety of people, ideas, practices and communities. Because coronavirus conspiracy theories have yet to settle down, let’s turn to some markedly different conspiracy theory subcultures that have been around for longer. They illustrate how different conspiracy theories and the people who subscribe to them can be.

Starting with the anti-vaccination movement – of great concern to many. Because many anti-vaxxers in the western world are highly educated urban hipsters, it is difficult to reject them as ignorant deplorables.

Read more: Throwing science at anti-vaxxers just makes them more hardline

Next to critiques of Big Pharma, vaccine hesitancy is informed by holistic and naturalistic ideas about health and the body; ideas rooted in alternative medicine and New Age spiritualities. In these subcultural worlds, emotions, feelings, experiences, testimonies and social relations are often more important guides than scientific knowledge.

Rather different are those active in the 9/11 Truth Movement. Broadly interested in geopolitics and government cover ups, these people challenge the mainstream narrative of 9/11 with competing factual and scientific evidence. They advance visual proofs and mathematical calculations of why the towers could not have collapsed by the planes, but indicate controlled demolition instead.

These activists profess knowledge of physics, construction and explosives, and ground their legitimacy in this expertise. They are focused on “exposing the official lies”. Like true activists, they wish revolutionary change, “to end the regime and illicit power structures responsible for 9/11”.

The list of markedly different conspiracy subcultures could go on. Think of the Flat Earthers, who deploy various scientific methodologies and perform actual experiments in the outside world to show that it is not a globe but a Truman Show-like dome.

Read more: I watched an entire Flat Earth Convention for my research – here's what I learnt

Favouring rational thinking and scientific methods is, however, no guarantee for brotherhood. 9/11 Truthers generally stay away from them as that would harm their credibility.

QAnon followers, meanwhile, deploy various strategies to interpret secret messages from their anonymous leader Q. These are known as “crumbs” or “drops” and are all part of their search for truth and redemption. Sharing many characteristics of millenarian New Religious Movements, QAnon followers anticipate a violent apocalypse when the conspiracy will be dismantled and followers will be vindicated.

This brief overview already shows the wide variety of themes, ideologies, plausibilities, origins, people and potential dangers of different conspiracy theory subcultures. Regarding conspiracy theories as one uniform category obscures all these differences and the various societal dynamics in which conspiracy theories play a role.

This inevitably leads to simplistic explanations. Further, it has the political effect of collectively stigmatising certain ideas and people – and prematurely excluding them from legitimate political debate. Conspiracy theories are not uniform – nor should our engagements with them be.",mainstream,M0f896,5g; bill.gates; flat.earth; nwo

785,"1. He was named for a Shawnee chief.

William Tecumseh Sherman (known as “Cump” to his friends) was born in Lancaster, Ohio, on February 8, 1820. His father gave him his unusual middle name as a nod to the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, a magnetic leader who built a confederacy of Ohio Indian tribes and fought with the British during the War of 1812. A relative later wrote that Sherman’s father always shook off concerns that he had given his son a “savage Indian name” by arguing, “Tecumseh was a great warrior.”

After losing his father at the age of 9, Sherman was sent to live with Thomas Ewing, a renowned Ohio attorney and family friend who later served as a senator and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. The young Sherman grew close with Ewing’s eldest daughter, Ellen, and they regularly corresponded through letters during his tenure at West Point and his early military career. Following a long engagement, the two were married in 1850 in a Washington, D.C., ceremony attended by the likes of President Zachary Taylor, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. The couple later had eight children, two of whom died from sickness while Sherman was serving in the Civil War.

3. He played a role in triggering the California Gold Rush.

While stationed in San Francisco in 1848, Sherman helped convince military governor Richard Mason to investigate one of the first reported gold discoveries in California. He was on the scene during a mission that confirmed the existence of rich gold deposits along the Sacramento River, and later penned the letter Mason sent to Washington relaying their findings. Coupled with other early discoveries, Sherman and Mason’s fact-finding mission inadvertently set off a wave of gold fever in the United States. In less than a year, California’s population more than quadrupled after thousands of speculators journeyed west to make their fortune.

4. He had a rocky career in business.

After missing out on combat in the Mexican American War and enduring a series of lackluster assignments, Sherman left the military in 1853 to run a San Francisco bank. While he proved a competent businessman, the move corresponded with the bursting of the Gold Rush bubble, and his branch collapsed in the ensuing financial hysteria. Sherman was left humiliated, in part because many military friends—including future Civil War generals Braxton Bragg and George Thomas—had entrusted money to him. To help cover their losses, he eventually liquidated some $20,000 worth of his own assets. A despondent Sherman left the banking world for good in 1858. He later signed on as the first superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy—the school that would become Louisiana State University.

5. He may have suffered a nervous breakdown during the Civil War.

Following a promising performance at July 1861’s First Battle of Bull Run, Sherman was promoted to brigadier general and eventually given command of Union troops in Kentucky and Tennessee. Sherman hadn’t wanted the role, and in short order, the weight of its responsibilities took a toll on his mental health. He vastly overestimated the size of Confederate forces in the region, griped in his dispatches to President Lincoln and appeared constantly on edge. Historians have since speculated that he was suffering from depression or nervous exhaustion, but whatever its cause, the general’s bizarre behavior eventually found its way into the papers, some of which labeled him insane. Sherman requested to be relieved from his position in early November 1861, and remained sidelined until that December, when he was reassigned to the Western Theater. He was later placed under the command of General Ulysses S. Grant, and following a crucial victory at April 1862’s Battle of Shiloh, the pair forged a winning partnership that lasted for the remainder of the war.

6. He cut off all lines of communication during the march to the sea.

Sherman’s March to the Sea was one of the most stunning operations of the Civil War, yet few people outside of Georgia knew anything about it while it was underway. Before leaving Atlanta, Sherman intentionally severed all telegraph links to the North to help shroud his moves in secrecy. The plan meant the Confederates could only speculate about where Sherman and his 60,000-strong rampaging army were headed, but it also left the Union high command in the dark about the mission’s progress. When asked about Sherman’s whereabouts, a worried President Lincoln is said to have responded, “We know what hole he went in, but we don’t know what hole he will come out of.” Sherman would finally reappear on December 22, having slashed and burned his way through the heart of Georgia. Upon reaching the sea, he sent a famous message to Lincoln that read: “I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the city of Savannah.”

7. He offered lenient terms of surrender to defeated Confederates.

Despite his reputation for “hard” warfare, Sherman could also be surprisingly—perhaps even naively—generous in victory. When he accepted Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston’s surrender in Durham, North Carolina, in April 1865, Sherman offered very forgiving terms that granted general amnesty to the rebels and even allowed for the Southern states to immediately re-enter the Union upon swearing an oath of allegiance. The sweeping agreement enraged U.S. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, who rejected it out of hand and criticized Sherman for giving up “all the advantages we had gained from the war.” Joseph Johnston was forced to surrender under more conventional terms, but he went on to become a good friend to Sherman, and even served as a pallbearer at his old adversary’s funeral in 1891.

8. He also used his “scorched earth” brand of warfare against Native Americans.

After the Civil War, Sherman was given command of the Military Division of the Mississippi and tasked with pacifying the Plains Indians during the building of the transcontinental railroad. Sherman took to the job with characteristic vigor, orchestrating the relocation of the tribes and warning their chiefs, “you cannot stop the locomotive any more than you can stop the sun or the moon, and you must submit.” To help break the natives’ spirit, Sherman took a page from his Civil War playbook and set his sights on destroying one of their primary resources: the buffalo. Beginning in the late 1860s, he organized the killing of some 5 million bison in an effort to drive the creatures to the brink of extinction. Sherman continued his harsh policies after becoming commanding general of the army in 1869, and by the 1870s, he had helped force most of the Plains peoples onto reservations.

9. He repeatedly declined to run for president.

Sherman made no secret of his disdain for politics, once quipping that he would rather spend four years in jail than in the White House. Nevertheless, during the 1870s and 1880s, Washington D.C., movers and shakers often tried—and failed—to convince him to make a run at the presidency. Sherman tried to stamp out the speculation once and for all in 1884, when he turned down an invitation to become the Republican candidate by saying, “I will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected.” His unequivocal response has since become famous in political circles, where similar flat refusals are often dubbed “Shermanesque statements.”",mainstream,M0ac3f,flat.earth

Daughter Of CIA Assassin Paymaster Tries To Bring Down Trump Supreme Court Nominee Kavanaugh

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

An intriguing in-depth new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that a Stanford University Psychiatry Professor named Dr. Christine Blasey has become the latest centerpiece of a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) plot to harm President Trump with her last-minute allegation, just days prior to US Senate confirmation, that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had attempted to sexually assault her over 30 years ago when they were teenage school children—while being kept from the American people about Dr. Blasey is that she currently oversees the CIA Undergraduate Internship Program Stanford University developed by the notorious CIA-connected Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges—who himself, in 1985, took into his care the homeless woman Lois Lang who assassinated CIA paymaster Nick Deak—and that afterwards saw the CIA’s black operations monies being controlled by Ralph G. Blasey Jr.—who, not so mysteriously, just happens to be the father of Dr. Christine Blasey. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

According to this report, with Trump being warned, just prior to his assuming the presidency, by the powerful Democratic Party US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that US intelligence services “have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you”, this past nearly two years has shown just how prescient this warning was—and whose latest “strike back” against Trump is coming courtesy of a rogue CIA faction who have just trotted out for public display Dr. Christine Blasey (married name Christine Blasey Ford)—who claims that as a young high school teenager Brett Kavanaugh, also a high school teenager, tried to sexually assault her—but whose “evidence” for this being true shows Dr. Blasey unable to name the exact year it happened, her not remembering where the incident took place or how she got home, her not being able to remember key details of the incident, her not remembering how the gathering came together the night of the incident, and her not telling anyone else about at the time—but should be expected to be the case from an unproven salacious allegation of this sort as it comes from a woman supporting the Democratic Party and who, also, hates President Trump.

As the “ ” aligned mainstream propaganda media began flooding the airwaves, newspapers and internet with Dr. Blasey’s claims against Judge Kavanaugh, that have absolutely no proof or evidence behind anyone could ever investigate, this report continues, SVR intelligence analysts were immediately able to bring up her file in the archive of known and/or suspected CIA operatives—and whose placement in this file was due to her extensive and advanced educational training at Stanford University in the CIA-funded mind control-brainwashing techniques developed by Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges—whose primary mission for the CIA was to develop new technologies for interrogation and torture, secondary applications going towards studying the possibilities of exploiting highly “suggestible” subjects and getting them to do things — murders, couriers — they wouldn’t otherwise do, and of which they would have no memory in case they were caught.

Linked to Dr. Blasey’s SVR file of known and/or suspected CIA operatives, this report notes, is that of her father Ralph G. Blasey Jr.—a proven CIA operative who, from June-1962 to January-1974, was the Vice President of National Savings and Trust of Washington, D.C.—a CIA black budget bank best known for being 100 paces from the White House, and whom, in 1998, was taken over by SunTrust Bank—whose majority share owner is the CIA-linked investment fund BlackRock.

The importance of noting the CIA banking connections of Ralph G. Blasey Jr., this report explains, is due to the outbreak of what is now known as the “CIA Bank War”—and whose start of, in 1982, a CIA seized from publication news report (Declassified in Part-Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/05: CIA-RDP90-00965R00150010-7) describes as: “This is Wall Street, the center of the international banking system, a system on the edge of a crisis so severe that the Central Intelligence Agency is preparing drastic measures. Something must be done to avert the breakdown of the Free World's monetary system.”

The main CIA operative involved in this war, and whom Ralph G. Blasey Jr. reported to, this report details, was Nicholas Deak—a longtime OSS and CIA operative, both during and after World War II, who ran the CIA’s main black budget operations under the direct command of the feared CIA Counterintelligence Chief James Jesus Angleton.

To how the CIA prevented the total breakdown of the Western banking system in 1982, this report says, was by their illegally laundering hundreds-of-millions of dollars of Colombian drug cartel cash into it to keep it afloat in an operation overseen by the CIA’s “James Bond of Money” Nickolas Deak—but when the President Ronald Reagan administration found out what the CIA had done, and started investigating it, saw Deak, on 19 November 1985, being assassinated in his New York City office by a homeless woman named Lois Lang—who had mysteriously managed to travel thousands-of-miles across the United States from Seattle to conduct this killing in what news reports at the time described as:

Lang saw him and turned the corner with purpose, aiming the pistol with both arms.

When she had Deak in her sights, she froze, transfixed. “It was as if she’d finally found what she was looking for,” a witness later testified.

Deak seized the pause to lunge and grab Lang’s throat with both hands, pressing his body into hers.

She fired once next to Deak’s ear and missed wide, before pushing him away just enough to bring the gun into his body and land a shot above his heart.

The bullet ricocheted off his collarbone and shredded his organs.

Deak crumbled onto the floor. “Now you’ve got yours,” said Lang.

A witness later claimed she took out a camera and snapped photographs of her victim’s expiring body.

The bag lady then grabbed the banker by the legs, dragged him into his office, and shut the door.

Though the American people were correctly told that Nicolas Deak assassin Lois Lang had previously been under psychiatric care, this report continues, what was failed to be reported to them was that Lang had been under the direct care and medical supervision of the CIA’s own Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges just prior to her traveling from Seattle to New York City to carry out this assassination—and who was the exact type of assassin Dr. Melges had been working to create in his CIA-funded mind control MKULTRA programme—and whose Canadian victims of are still being silenced after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, this past December, imposed a gag order on them to keep them silent—but that does apply to Judge Kavanaugh accuser Dr. Christine Blasey, who remains able to teach her CIA Undergraduate Internship Program at Stanford University the MKULTRA mind control techniques discovered by Dr. Melges.

Like his daughter Dr. Christine Blasey, this report concludes, CIA black money operative Ralph G. Blasey Jr. remains secure, too—and who, today, is the Vice President of Business Development of Red Coats, Inc.—whose Admiral Security Services provides armed security for “Deep State” elites in Washington D.C.—that is overseen by Red Coats, Inc. co-founder and Vice Chairman William F. Peel III—and whose Datawatch Systems, Peel III also controls, has US government contracts extending till 23 June 2023 under the category of 246.42.1 to provide US defense and intelligence agencies with facility management systems to include accessories and repair parts, computerized systems for surveillance, monitoring, controlling, signaling and reporting multiple functions—all of which SVR intelligence analysts believe the American people have the right to know about in their evaluating the claims against Judge Kavanaugh being leveled against him by Dr. Christine Beasley—but who know it will never happen.

Trump Meets Top QAnon Backer In White House As Australia Becomes Latest Nation To Rout Soros Forces",conspiracy,C041df,flat.earth; mind.control
826,"Grounding, also called earthing, is a therapeutic technique that involves doing activities that “ground” or electrically reconnect you to the earth. This practice relies on earthing science and grounding physics to explain how from the earth can have positive effects on your body. This type of grounding therapy isn’t entirely the same as the technique that is used in mental health treatment. In this article, we’ll explore the science behind grounding energy, the risks and benefits of using earthing techniques, and how to perform grounding.

What the science says Grounding is currently an under-researched topic and there are very few scientific studies on the benefits. However, the most recent scientific research has explored grounding for inflammation, cardiovascular disease, muscle damage, chronic pain, and mood. The central theory from one is that grounding affects the living matrix, which is the central connector between living cells. Electrical conductivity exists within the matrix that functions as an immune system defense, similar to antioxidants. They believe that through grounding, the natural defenses of the body can be restored. Further research expands on this idea. In a on grounding and heart health, 10 healthy participants were grounded using patches on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet. Blood measurements were taken before and after grounding to determine any changes in red blood cell fluidity, which plays a role in heart health. The results indicated significantly less red blood cell clumping after grounding, which suggests benefits for cardiovascular health. Another slightly examined the role of grounding on post-exercise muscle damage. Researchers used both grounding patches and mats and measured creatine kinase, white blood cell count, and pain levels before and after grounding. Blood work indicated that grounding reduced muscle damage and pain in participants. This suggests that grounding may influence healing abilities. This research is supported by a recent on grounding for pain reduction and mood improvement. Sixteen massage therapists alternated between periods of grounding and no grounding. Before grounding therapy, physical and emotional stress and pain were common side effects of their physically demanding jobs. After the earthing therapy, pain, stress, depression, and fatigue were all reduced among participants. Most of the studies on grounding are small and rely somewhat on subjective measures, such as self-reported feelings, mood, or even self-administered treatment. Some studies also rely on blood markers, such as those that detect inflammation, but the size and shortage of these studies suggests that more research is needed.

There are many types of grounding. All of them focus on reconnecting yourself to the earth. This can be done through either direct or indirect contact with the earth. Have you ever been outside on a warm summer day and felt the urge to run barefoot in the grass? One of the easiest ways to ground yourself to the earth is to walk barefoot. Whether this is on grass, sand, or even mud, allowing your skin to touch the natural ground can provide you with grounding energy. You can increase your skin-to-earth contact by lying on the ground. You can do it in the grass by the park or on the sand at the beach. If you’re going to ground yourself in this way, be sure to take the proper precautions and never lie somewhere you could be injured. According to advocates for grounding, water may be used to ground in the same way the physical earth is used for grounding. They suggest simply wading in a clear lake or swimming in the ocean as a way to ground yourself. As always, be sure to stay safe when swimming, especially in murky or deep waters. When going outside to ground yourself isn’t an option, there are . One method of earthing involves connecting a metal rod to the ground outside and then connecting the rod to your body through a wire. If you’re not comfortable using a metal rod to ground yourself, there’s other grounding equipment available. This equipment is an effective way to incorporate earthing therapy into your daily life and includes: You can find grounding mats, sheets, blankets, socks, and bands online.

There’s not much research on the benefits of grounding. However, people have reported improvement for conditions such as:
• Chronic fatigue. In the on massage therapists, many reported a decrease in their fatigue levels after four weeks of treatment with grounding mats.
• Chronic pain. The on grounding for exercise recovery found that those who used grounding patches reported lower pain levels.
• Anxiety and depression. In one small , it was shown that even 1 hour of grounding therapy can significantly improve mood.
• Sleep disorders. The massage therapists also experienced an improvement in sleep length and reduce sleep disturbances with grounding therapy.
• Cardiovascular disease. Results of one treatment found that long-term self-administered grounding therapy helped to reduce blood pressure levels in participants with hypertension.

808,"""First, a brief tour of the worldview of a flat-earther: While writing off buckets of concrete evidence that Earth is spherical, they readily accept a laundry list of propositions that some would call ludicrous. The leading flat-Earther theory holds that Earth is a disc with the Arctic Circle in the center and Antarctica, a 150-foot-tall wall of ice, around the rim. NASA employees, they say, guard this ice wall to prevent people from climbing over and falling off the disc. Earth's day and night cycle is explained by positing that the sun and moon are spheres measuring 32 miles (51 kilometers) that move in circles 3,000 miles (4,828 km) above the plane of the Earth. (Stars, they say, move in a plane 3,100 miles up.) Like spotlights, these celestial spheres illuminate different portions of the planet in a 24-hour cycle. Flat-earthers believe there must also be an invisible 'antimoon' that obscures the moon during lunar eclipses.",mainstream,M0be38,flat.earth
32,"War is not about ""nation building"" ""bringing democracy to dictatorships"" ""stopping terror"" or any other claptrap. War is about killing human beings. You see, I am a killer. I have participated in killing other human beings. The Vietnamese soldiers were trying to kill us. We were all young and brainwashed, and weren't smart enough (yet) to know what we were being asked to do. I was on a firebase next to Highway One, a main thoroughfare in south Vietnam that ran through a portion of the country known as the Elephant's Ear. It was called the Elephant's Ear because of the shape of the border's protrusion into Cambodia. Ours was an artillery station that carried a battery (6) of 105mm howitzers and a battery of 155 mm howitzers. These are very big guns. We were also camp to others: mortar squads, infantry units and sundry support services. This was in 1968, the year of the ""Tet Offensive"", the great push by the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong (civilian anti-American guerrilla forces) to rid the country of the ""foreign invaders"" (us). It was one peaceful Sunday evening in March, a cooler day in the hottest part of the year. Everyone was going on their usual routines of duty and maintenence when the shit hit the fan. Mortars began to whistle in. The cry, ""Incoming, incoming"" went over the landing zone's p.a. system. Everyone went to the trenches, or found whatever cover they could. I was caught out in the open. My only alternative was lay flat on the hard earth, not far from the trench dug for our unit. Shells rained down all around. Explosions went off everywhere, and my unit remained in the trench. I screamed ""We better get up here and do something,"" to the guys in the trench. I thought they were cowering. They were not cowering. They had not received orders yet, and one does nothing in the military without orders. Nearby, one or two of the fire pits, where excess round charges were kept, went up in pillars of fire. Gaining some self control, I went to the water supply and poured water on the fire pits that were close to my unit to prevent them from going up in flames. The other members of my unit were still in the foxhole awaiting orders. The orders came. ""Battery, adjust. Shell H.E., lot six, fuse time, deflection 1540, azimuth 320."" This told the unit how to adjust the aim of the huge guns. We all went about our tasks of preparing the big guns efficiently, heedless in this hour of necessity of the death whistling nearby, blind to everything but our task. Our hope only was group survival. This violence and shelling and death went on all night. As various units ran out of ordinance, we went through open areas to deliver fifty pound rounds on our shoulders. We were aware of, but not reacting to, the threat of instant death or injury all around us. After a number of hours (who can say how many or how few) exhaustion set in, and me and a buddy crawled into a culvert to sleep, the battle still raging all around, but we were too exhausted to care. When I awoke, all was quiet, but the aftermath of the battle was there. There was devastation all around. I found that the perimeter had been broached a number of times but superior firepower had stopped the people trying to break in, leaving their bodies to pile up inbetween the outer ring of wire and the inner. There were bodies all around, or parts of bodies, or bodies blown in half, or bodies with heads split open looking for all the world like some kind of watermelon, with their bright red insides. Hundreds of parts or half or whole bodies. Numbers impossible to estimate accurately, due to the dismembered state of the dead. There were probably hundreds. I stopped and gazed down at the corpse of a young boy, a dead N.V.A. soldier, and I saw someone very much like myself. Unlike others nearby, he was whole. No apparant cause of death visible. I stared into his face, wondering about him. What kind of person was he? Who was the family he had left behind? Now I know that his family would be left wondering forever whatever happened to him, because they would never have his remains. They, after years of hope and greif, would have to either assume him dead, or maybe lost, him only a memory. I still see his face these many years later, a brother unto me, me alive, him dead. He was as if sleeping, still free from obvious corruption if not for the pallor of his skin or the flies moving in and out of his nose. Shortly after dawn, we were called to order. Some names did not answer to roll call. No explanations at that time were forthcoming. Tasks were given out. ""Who wants body detail?"" said the sargeant. Only one or two volunteered. ""Ok, you, you, you, you and you, go out there and clean up."" The men were divided into teams, given wheelbarrows, and were sent out to bring the bodies and parts to a specific place. That went on all morning. It took a few days for the bulldozer to be shipped in by flying crane, and when it arrived, a giant pit was dug and all the human remains that were collectable were buried there. Our dead, about seven, were shipped home to the states. Many of the enemy dead were not able to be collected. They were in enemy territory, and were left to the enemy. Many had been wounded and crawled to hidden areas in the surrounding jungle where they died later. Some were near unexploded ordinance and were extremely dangerous. The end result was the stench of death. God, what a stench. It was all-pervading. Another result was a plague of flies. You had to eat anyway, knowing that the flies that were living on the human carnage were the same ones that were landing on your sandwich. There were clouds of white termite-like flies that presumably fed on the dead, and these were called ""body bugs"" and were avoided as much as possible. The white flies were probably taking the blame for the other, more ordinary flies, who were more easily tolerated but who were in actuality also feeding off the same ""table."" With time and burial, the plague of flies and the stench lessened. As the weeks went by, the battle was just another psychological scar torn through the distance of self, to be buried in the press of duty, to emerge years later, leaving you weeping unexpectedly at jovial occasions, much to the puzzlement of your family or friends. Some of the enemy had gotten through the perimeter, and had in a suicidal paroxysm, tried to do as much damage as possible before being killed. One private, recently promoted to ""temporary corporal"" in lieu of his later promised advancement, (we called them ""candy stripers"" as they wore a black band with their future rank on it) was able to put an end to one of these invaders. He had shot him through the back, the automatic weapons fire (m16) moving through his body in a pattern, making a series of holes through from the back to the front of the body like buttons on a jacket. This individual took polaroid photos of his ""trophy"" and gave them to me for safe keeping. Why he had selected me for this task wasn't clear, but I was the wrong person to give them to. I buried them, repelled by the concept of human dead as trophy material. I got into a big fight when he tried to get his photos and I said that I had ""lost"" them. Lots of others were not so squeamish, however. Some kept photos, or articles of clothing, weapons, medals or body parts, mostly ears, dried in the sun to a leather like texture, from the ones they killed. I remember Sgt. Hirshberg telling me that he had to boil a belt that he got from a N.V.A. soldier's corpse for two days to get the stink of death out of it. Soon after, Sgt. Hirshberg himself was found dead. Perhaps an N.V.A. soldier boiled his belt. That kind of thing that was as common as bread, then. Death. Human beings lowered to the basest impulses within themselves, killed other human beings for the thrill of it, easily and without thought as easily as you would fish in your pocket for change to take the bus. Killing is legal, there. You would go to prison here, or perhaps get the death penalty for the killing and and the mutiliation. In Vietnam it was sport. No morality. No ethics about who shall die and live. Nope. Death was sport. Or revenge. Often, the enemy would horribly mutilate our dead, to instill terror or just to say ""fuck you"" in the worst way possible. We would retaliate in kind. I remember a group of infantry men telling how they cut off the penises of their enemy and shoved them in the mouths of the newly dead as a kind of ""fuck you back"" gesture. Death then becomes a kind of communication, a grisly ""postcard"" if you will. Forget about right and wrong. It doesn't exist. Only survival, hatred, revenge and killing. In the crucible of war, it all boils down to the lowest denominators. There is little mercy. When we human beings are placed in a kill or be killed situation, we can only become killers. We see our friends die and revenge is our only outlet. You make the most of the situation by becoming the most beautiful artistic killer possible. Right and wrong? A just war? The military was engaged in a psychological war as well, entreating by helicopter equipped with speakers for the enemy to ""give up, give up. You will be treated fairly and those of you who are innocent will be sent back to your families"". They flew over the countryside calling out in the Vietnamese language,""Chiu hoi, chiu hoi..."" They also dropped leaflets with the same message by the thousands over the land. I saw firsthand the benefits of this ""mercy program."" I was watching as an N.V.A. soldier was cornered in the nearby countryside and had decided to give in to the cries of ""chiu hoi"" that our soldiers were making. He put his weapons on the ground. He stood up with his hands behind his head. A burst of gunfire and a ""Take that, motherfucker"" and it was over. It wasn't a puzzle to me why the program met with little success. I haven't even gotten to the non combatants yet. Men, women and children, innocents all, falling to the stray bullet, being blown apart by the hidden mine, town destroyed by the misplaced bomb, or worse. It seems that we have forgotten about Lt. William Calley and the village of Mi Lai. William Calley was court martialed and found guilty of the massacre of a number of innocent men women and children. He rounded up the inhabitants of this small hamlet, collected them together as possible enemy collaborators and ordered them all to be killed, burning the village after. The men who refused to fire upon the people who played a major part in his conviction. William Calley was an offering to the millions who were protesting the war here at home. Many others followed his methods and were not punished for their crimes. They suffer only the nightmares that doubtless still haunt them. It is estimated by some that one to three million non-combatants, civilians, died as a direct or indirect result of the Viet Nam conflict. I must believe that there are other ways. I must believe that we can find other means. To think otherwise would be anathematic to my very life, and I would either retreat into irreversible insanity or suicide, as so many of my fellows have done. Is it any wonder that the war veteran has the highest rate of ""non-functionality"": drug addiction, alcholism and suicide, of any other group? Do you know that war veterans comprise the largest part of the homeless? I know why they ""drop out"". For years, I was unemployed, way, way into drugs. I found it impossible to work a job that paid taxes to the Death Machine. By the grace of God I escaped the fate of so many, to be reduced to a voiceless suffering shell of what I could be. I came back alive from this cauldron of death to tell you that there must be another way. So many others did not come back, will not come back, and I speak for them.

651,"Environmental groups have blasted draft text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) released yesterday by WikiLeaks as potentially devastating to the environment and wildlife.

The massive 12-nation free trade agreement has been negotiated in secret now for almost four years, and the information release by WikiLeaks shows that key environmental safeguards in the agreement are being stripped away, including a ban on shark fining and illegal logging, as well as legally-enforced pollution regulations.

“If the environment chapter is finalized as written in this leaked document, President Obama’s environmental trade record would be worse than George W. Bush’s,” Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said bluntly. “This draft chapter falls flat on every single one of our issues — oceans, fish, wildlife, and forest protections — and in fact, rolls back on the progress made in past free trade pacts.”



The TPP has been one of the Obama Administration’s top priorities for the Pacific region, but green groups say that it looks like the administration has given significant ground on crucial environmental issues in a desire to get the deal signed, which has already run past its goal of finalization by 2013.

Many past free trade agreements have wholly lacked any legally-binding environmental safeguards, but in 2007 then U.S. President George W. Bush struck an agreement with democrats to include environmental safeguards in all future free trade agreements.

However, environmentalists are now concerned that this requirement will bring about little environmental gains in the TPP. For example, the draft text completely lacks any enforcement.

An analysis by Jane Kelsey with the University of Aukland finds that the draft text “falls far below the standards” set by the U.S. Congress in 2007.

“Negotiators are allowing a unique opportunity to protect wildlife and support legal sustainable trade of renewable resources to slip through their fingers. these nations account for more than a quarter of global trade in fish and wood products and they have a responsibility to address trade’s impact on wildlife crime, illegal logging, and overfishing,” said Carter Roberts, President of World Wildlife Fund (WWF), who called the information leak a “peek behind the curtain.”

According to the release by WikiLeaks, the TPP as it stands does not even require member nations to uphold commitments to global environmental agreements, such the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

Criticism of the TPP goes well-beyond environmental issues, however. Many groups have complained of the investor-state settlement agreement in the plan that allows corporations to sue countries when contracts are breached.

Critics of this model say it benefits foreign investors as they expense of human rights, working conditions, and the environment. Negotiations have also been blasted for being held completely behind closed doors, with some U.S. Senators complaining that multinational corporations are privy to the negotiations while the U.S. Congress is left in the dark.

In addition to the U.S., TPP member states include Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Chile, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam and Peru.",conspiracy,C006e4,flat.earth
661,"One week after the Huygens space probe landed on distant Titan, European and American scientists have revealed startling new information about this largest and most mysterious moon of the planet Saturn. There appear to be rocklike structures and flowing liquid on Titan - even, they believe, a form of liquid methane rainfall. Earth-like characteristics described Friday by scientists at the European Space Institute in Paris.

Just a week ago, scientists were applauding the successful landing of the space probe, which plunged through the murky, chilling air of Titan to land on a spongy surface they described as wet sand or soft clay. It appears a mysterious, pinkish orangey world. Pictures sent by the probe showed a flat terrain with fist-sized objects that researchers described as chunks of ice.

Now, scientists have been able to sift through dozens of images sent by the Huygens space probe over the space of several hours before its batteries went dead. Martin Tomasko, one of the principal investigators for the Titan project, describes some of the grainy, black and white images to reporters. ""This is a field of view one kilometer across and you see this very rugged terrain,"" he says. ""We see a ridge system.""

The pictures show spidery dark lines etched on Titan's surface. There are also lighter areas. They appear a mystery to ordinary viewers. But the projects scientists believe they are rivers, streams and channels of liquid. Only the liquid isn't water, which would be frozen solid at on Titan, where it's around 170 degrees below zero. Instead, the evidence is that it's liquid methane. Scientists even believe it rains regularly on this far-off moon, located a four billion kilometer journey through the Solar System from earth. Only it's methane rain.

And that's not all. There appears to be stuff like dirt on Titan, and large chunks that are similar to rocks. Scientists believe the sandy substance is in fact shards of crushed ice on Titan. The rocklike substances are larger chunks of ice.

Titan seems vastly different from our home planet, but European Space Agency mission manager Jean-Pierre Lebreton says he is struck by the similarities. ""Our new picture of Titan is really fascinating. And what we are seeing is earth-like processes on Titan. But the big difference is the ingredients are somewhat different. The liquid on Titan is methane, the liquid on earth is water. The rocks on earth are silicate. The rocks on Titan are ice blocks. And the dirt on earth is our dirt. The dirt on Titan is organic matter,"" he says.

Only a week after receiving date from the Huygens probe, the scientists' findings are still preliminary. They say it will take weeks and months to sift through the rich trove of data sent by the space probe. And they say many mysteries remain.

The Titan landing is a joint project by European and American scientists. It took the Huygens probe seven years to reach the planet, traveling aboard the Saturn probe Cassini. And it took Huygens more than two hours to float down to Titan's surface, slowed down by parachutes. The probe settled some 10-15 centimeters into the top layers of Titans spongy surface.

Scientist Martin Tomasko says the probe seems to have settled in a dry corner of the planet - similar to parts of Africa or the United States. ""The region we landed in is more typical of arid regions on the earth. We don't think we have open pools of liquid methane, but the methane kind of sinks down into the surface material, into the sand, if you will. It's more like Arizona, or a place like that, where the river beds are dry most of the time,"" he says.

Because the probe landed on only one area of Titan, scientists have no idea whether it's representative of the entire moon, or whether there are more humid regions elsewhere. They also don't know whether Titan has seasons - like a rainy season and a dry season. But they do believe there is regular precipitation on Titan; it could very well have rained liquid methane the day before the probe landed.

The Titan findings mark a coup for the 15-country European Space Agency, which worked in collaboration with America's NASA. The Europeans are also savoring an earlier success of a Mars mission, which produced photographs, which its scientists say offer the most direct evidence that water in the form of ice may exist on that planet. Other future projects include two other missions to Mars and one to Venus. And scientists Friday suggested it might be possible to explore Titan in the future with a moving rover.

Even with its earth-like characteristics, it's almost impossible to imagine existing in Saturn's frozen, far-off moon. But there may come a day - a very long time from now - when Titan may actually be livable for carbon-based life forms like we know here on Earth. Scientist Toby Owen, from the Institute for Astronomy in Hawaii, explains. ""In about four billion years, our sun will expand and will become a red giant. And when than happens, there's been a couple of scientific papers that have suggested that the temperatures in the outer solar system will rise, long after life has become impossible on earth. Temperatures will rise on Titan, the water ice will melt, the water ice will be released, and because we have the very basic building blocks for life in the form of organic molecules, for a very brief time, Titan may be a very good place,"" he says.for life.

But for right now, it seems clear that humans are far better off exploring Titan from where we are now -- our warm, oxygenated and faraway planet, Earth.",mainstream,M16f1d,flat.earth

The Internet was quick to pounce on the tweet, with experts citing examples of animals that experience painful sex. “Yeah I’m sure female cats *love* those spined cat penises. Oh and bedbugs can’t get enough traumatic insemination,” tweeted Nerdist science editor Kyle Hill.

864,"Researchers surveying an ancient complex of Neolithic standing stones on a Scottish island believe they have uncovered extraordinary evidence of the likely inspiration for the circular site, the scar of a huge lightning strike.

Archaeologists have long studied connections between ancient stone circles and forces of nature, such as the position of the stars and the courses of the Moon and Sun, but this may be the first time a powerful lightning strike could have inspired such amazing feats of ingenuity.

Researchers from the University of St. Andrews were studying the stone circle Tursachan Calanais on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, when they began satellite-mapping the main stone circle site.

While working on Site XI, or Airigh na Beinne Bige, which consists of a single standing stone on an exposed hillside overlooking the larger circle of standing stones, they discovered a massive star-shaped anomaly in the center which they believe was caused by either multiple smaller lightning strikes or one truly earth-shattering impact.

“Such clear evidence for lightning strikes is extremely rare in the UK and the association with this stone circle is unlikely to be coincidental,” said project leader Dr Richard Bates, of the University of St Andrews.

“Whether the lightning at Site XI focused on a tree or rock which is no longer there, or the monument itself attracted strikes, is uncertain. However, this remarkable evidence suggests that the forces of nature could have been intimately linked with everyday life and beliefs of the early farming communities on the island.”

The 3D modelling was part of the Calanais Virtual Reconstruction Project, in which the team were able to virtually recreate the circle and map the transit of the Sun and Moon around it for the first time in four millennia.

Nowadays, the stones are either lying flat or have been buried under peat which slowly consumed the site over thousands of years. The researchers hope to conduct further geophysical surveys at the site to better understand the relationship between natural phenomena and the incredible Neolithic engineering efforts at the site.

1079,"Pluto's surface hosts blades of ice that soar to the height of skyscrapers — and researchers have narrowed down exactly how the dramatic features form.

According to new research, the blades are made mostly of methane ice, and form similarly to (much shorter) spikes of snow and ice on Earth.

When the New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto in July 2015, researchers observed an astonishing variety of terrains across the dwarf planet. Flat and cratered areas on the dwarf planet's surface point to its varied geological activity, composition and evolution over time.

The jagged spikes targeted in this latest study form at the highest altitudes on Pluto's surface, near its atmosphere, where methane is able to freeze out of the atmosphere — skipping straight from solid to gas without ever becoming liquid. When the climate is a bit warmer, parts of the methane ice sublimate away, heading straight back to gas form, according to the new study.

""When we realized that bladed terrain consists of tall deposits of methane ice, we asked ourselves why it forms all of these ridges, as opposed to just being big blobs of ice on the ground,"" Jeffrey Moore, a New Horizons team member and lead researcher on the new work, said in a statement. ""It turns out that Pluto undergoes climate variation and sometimes, when Pluto is a little warmer, the methane ice begins to basically 'evaporate' away.""

On Earth, such structures are called penitentes, and stretch just a few meters in height in high-altitude regions along the planet's equator. Slight irregularities can turn into dramatic spikes of snow as the structures' surfaces concentrate sunlight toward certain regions, sublimating some parts faster than others and leading to longer and spikier forms.

The presence of penitentes on Pluto tell researchers more about how its surface and air temperature change over time, according to the statement, and the link between methane's presence and high elevations can help researchers map the dwarf planet's topography in places where they have lower-resolution views.

The new work will appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Icarus.

549,"Israel's Beresheet lunar lander captured this selfie, which was released March 5, when the spacecraft was 23,363.5 miles (37,600 kilometers) from Earth. Australia is clearly visible.

Israel's first lunar lander has notched another important milestone — its first in-space selfie.

The newly released photo shows the robotic lander, known as Beresheet, looking back at Earth from a distance of 23,363.5 miles (37,600 kilometers).

""In the photo of Earth, taken during a slow spin of the spacecraft, Australia is clearly visible,"" mission team members wrote in an image description today (March 5). ""Also seen is the plaque installed on the spacecraft, with the Israeli flag and the inscriptions 'Am Yisrael Chai' and 'Small Country, Big Dreams.'""

The Hebrew phrase ""Am Yisrael chai"" translates as, ""The nation of Israel lives,"" or, ""The people of Israel live.""

Several more such maneuvers are on the docket in the near future. If all goes according to plan, Beresheet — which means ""in the beginning"" in Hebrew — will be captured into lunar orbit on April 4, then drop softly onto the moon's surface on April 11.

That landing would be a major achievement. To date, the only entities to pull off a soft lunar touchdown are three superpower nations: the Soviet Union, the United States and China.

SpaceIL began as a competitor in the Google Lunar X Prize, a $30 million race that asked privately funded teams to land a robot on the moon and have it perform a few basic tasks. The contest ended last year without a winner, but SpaceIL and several other former teams continued shooting for the moon.

The entire Beresheet mission, including launch, costs about $100 million, mission team members have said.

Beresheet's ride through space hasn't been entirely smooth. Shortly after liftoff, team members noticed that the craft's star trackers, which are critical to navigation, are susceptible to blinding by solar radiation. And Beresheet's computer performed a reset unexpectedly just before the craft's second planned engine burn.

Mission team members have overcome these issues. For example, they traced the computer reset to cosmic radiation and firmed up Beresheet's defenses with a software update. The lander was then able to execute the engine burn, which put Beresheet back on track toward the moon.

Posted 16 Mar 2011

On April 26, 1986, a reactor at the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine exploded, causing the worst nuclear accident the world has seen. It sent a plume into the atmosphere with radioactive fallout that was 400 times greater than that released in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The plume drifted across much of the western Soviet Union. Parts of Eastern, Northern and Western Europe were also affected. 



Fifty people were killed at the reactor site at the time of the accident, but the number of people across Europe who found themselves in the path of the radioactive plume is anybody’s guess. A report from the World Nuclear Association (http://world-nuclear.org/info/chernobyl/inf07.html) claims that over one million people may have been exposed to radiation. However, the full extent of the damage is unlikely to ever be known.

Until March 2011, the worst nuclear accident in the history of Japan took place at a uranium facility in Tokaimura on September 30, 1999. Three workers were attempting to mix nitric acid and uranium to form the fuel uranyl nitrate. However, the workers unknowingly used seven times the allowable limit of uranium, and the reactor couldn’t stop the solution from reaching critical mass. 



The three technicians were exposed to massive gamma and neutron radiation poisoning, which killed two of them. More than 70 other workers received high doses of radiation as well. After an investigation, the International Atomic Energy Agency saidthat the accident had been caused by ""human error and serious breaches of safety principles.""

The worst nuclear accident in U.S. history took place on March 28, 1979 at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania. A cooling system failed, causing a partial meltdown, but a full meltdown was averted and there were no fatalities. However, despite the positive outcome and despite the passage of more than 30 years, the incident remains fresh in the minds of those who are old enough to remember it. 



The effect of the accident on the U.S. nuclear power industry was major. The meltdown gave many Americans second thoughts about the risks of using nuclear power, and the construction of new reactors, which had been steadily increasing since the 1960s, slowed substantially. Over 50 nuclear plant construction projects were cancelled in just four years, and the number of ongoing projects declined from 1980 until 1998.

One of the worst nuclear contamination incidents in the world took place in Goiania, Brazil. A radiotherapy institute in the city had relocated, leaving behind a teletherapy unit that still contained cesium chloride. 



On September 13, 1987, two scavengers found the unit, carted it away in a wheelbarrow and sold it to a junkyard. The owner invited friends and family to see the glowing blue material inside, inadvertently exposing them to radiation. All of them then went their separate ways and irradiated friends and family all over the city. 



In all, 245 people were exposed to radiation and four people died. According to Eliana Amaral of the International Atomic Energy Agency, one good thing came out of the catastrophe.""Before the 1987 accident… there was no awareness that sources must be controlled from ‘cradle to grave’ and to prevent the public accessing them. After the accident these concepts were fostered.""

On July 4, 1961, the Soviet submarine K-19 was in the North Atlantic Ocean when it developed a radioactive leak. It had no coolant system in place to stop the reactor from overheating and exploding, so with no other options, the crew entered the reactor compartment and fixed the leak, exposing themselves to levels of radiation in the process that were certain to kill them. All eight crew members who had fixed the leak died of radiation poisoning within three weeks of the incident. 



The rest of the crew, the submarine and the ballistic missiles that it carried also became contaminated. When K-19 met up with the submarine that had intercepted its distress call, it was towed to base, which it contaminated. Then, as it was repaired over the course of two years, the surrounding area and the repair workers also became contaminated. Twenty of the submarine’s original crew also died of radiation sickness over the next few years.

In the years following World War II, the United States was the foremost nuclear power in the world. In an effort to catch up, the Soviet Union quickly built nuclear power plants and cut corners in order to keep pace. 



The Mayak plant near the city of Kyshtym had a tank with a substandard cooling system as a result, and when it failed, the increasing temperature caused an explosion that contaminated almost 500 miles of the surrounding area. 



Initially, the Soviet government didn’t disclose what had happened, but one week later they had little choice. 10,000 people were evacuated from the area when some began to show signs of radiation sickness. Although the Soviet government refused to disclose any information about the accident, a study in Radiation and Environmental Biophysicsestimates that at least 200 people died from exposure to radiation. The Soviet government finally declassified information about the disaster in 1990.

On October 10, 1957, Windscale became the site of the worst nuclear accident in British history, and the worst in the world until Three Mile Island 22 years later. A facility had been built there to produce plutonium, but when the US successfully designed a nuclear bomb that used tritium, the facility was used to produce it for the UK. However, this required running the reactor at a higher temperature than its design could sustain, and it eventually caught fire. 



Operators at first worried that extinguishing the flames with water would cause a hydrogen explosion, but ultimately gave in and did so as the crisis escalated. It worked, but not before a sizeable amount of radiation had been unleashed into the surrounding area. A 2007 studyestimated that the incident had led to over 200 cases of cancer in the surrounding population.

The Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One, or SL-1, was a nuclear reactor located in the desert forty miles outside of Idaho Falls, Idaho. On January 3, 1961, the reactor exploded, killing three workers and causing a meltdown. The cause was a control rod that had been withdrawn incorrectly, but even after an investigation that took two years to complete, the actions taken by the workers just prior to the accident were never discovered. 



Although the accident released radioactive material into the atmosphere, it was considered a small amount, and the reactor’s remote location helped to minimize damage to the neighboring population. Still, the incident is notable for being the only fatal nuclear reactor accident in US history, and for inspiring a change to the design of nuclear reactors, so that a mishap involving a single control rod would not do this kind of damage.

On January 21, 1968, a US Air Force B-52 bomber was running a “Chrome Dome” mission, a Cold War-era operation in which US bombers with nuclear payloads stayed in the air at all times, all with nearby targets in the Soviet Union that were to be attacked if commanded. The bomber, which was carrying four hydrogen bombs caught fire. The nearest emergency landing location was at Thule Air Base in Greenland, but there was not enough time to reach it, so the crew abandoned the bomber. 



When it crashed, the nuclear payload ruptured and the area became contaminated with radiation. The March 2009 issue of Time magazine classified the event as one of the worst nuclear accidents of all time. The 1968 incident caused the immediate discontinuation of “Chrome Dome” missions, and more stable explosives were eventually developed so that nuclear weapons would be less likely to explode in an accident.

The Bohunice nuclear power plant was the first to be built in Czechoslovakia. The reactor was based on an experimental design that was meant to run on uranium mined in Czechoslovakia. However, the first-of-its-kind facility had multiple accidents, and it had to be shut down more than 30 times. 



Two workers had been killed in a 1976 incident, but the worst mishap occurred on February 22, 1977 when a worker removed control rods incorrectly during a routine fuel change. This simple error caused a massive radioactive leak, and the ensuing accident earned a level 4 rating on the International Nuclear Event Scale of 1 to 7. 



The Soviet government covered up the accident, so no reliable estimates of casualties have been released to the public. However, in 1979, the government decommissioned the plant, and it is expected to be fully dismantled in 2033.",mainstream,M12b54,flat.earth
676,"Yesterday, in the post “Just How Profoundly Have We Been Lied To About WWII?,” FOTM‘s TrailDust asks whether all we’ve been told about WWII, specifically Hitler and the Nazis, is actually true.

 For that, I applaud TrailDust’s courage, as I believe NOTHING should a priori be ruled beyond the realm of questioning.

 This post is my nugget of contribution to TrailDust’s query.

 

 A persistent popular misconception of Hitler and the Nazis is that they were Christians. Nothing can be further from the truth.

 Instead, Hitler and the Nazis were animated by Nordic paganism and the occult.

 The John Hay Library at Brown University contains a special collection — 81 of Hitler’s vast 16,000-volume library. The whereabouts of most of Hitler’s books is a mystery, although most scholars believe they’re scattered around Russia. We do know that 1,200 of them are in the Library of Congress in Washington, 81 in the John Hay Library. (Brown University)

 Hitler marked the margins of his books with vertical lines beside paragraphs or sentences he thought important. According to Timothy Ryback, in his book, Hitler’s Private Library: The Books That Shaped His Life, one notable subject represented in the John Hay Library’s Hitler collection is the occult, including a book that Hitler had marked — Ernst Schertel’s Magic: History, Theory and Practice (1923). Ryback points to one marked sentence in Magic as quite chilling, given Hitler’s history:

Some consider Hitler to be demonically possessed.

 As an example, Jean-Michel Angebert asks in The Occult and the Third Reich: The Mystical Origins of Nazism and the Search For the Holy Grail (pp. 191 and 22):



Lewis A. Sumberg, in his “Translator’s Preface” to Angebert’s volume, pointedly asks (pp. xii and xiii):

Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano wrote in his diary: “I am certain that even if the Germans were given more than they ask for, they would attack just the same, because they are possessed by the demon of destruction.” (Galeazzo Ciano, The Ciano Diaries, p. 582.)

 More recently, in an interview with Vatican Radio, the late Father Gabriel Amorth, Vatican’s chief exorcist, said:

“I am convinced that the Nazis were all possessed. All you have to do is think about what Hitler . . . did. Almost certainly they were possessed by the Devil. You can tell by their behaviour and their actions, from the horrors they committed and the atrocities that were committed on their orders.”

In fact, Vatican documents revealed that wartime pontiff Pope Pius XII had attempted a long-distance exorcism of Hitler. But the effort failed because, as Fr. Amorth explained, the possessed person must be consenting and willing and in the presence of the exorcist for the demon-banishing to succeed.

 Those who had known Hitler thought he was demonically possessed.

 Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels admitted he did not really know Hitler, although he worked with and saw the Führer almost every day. Goebbels told his aide-de-camp, Prince Schaumburg-Lippe, that there were times when Hitler gave him “the chills.”

 The most striking testimony is that by Hermann Rauschning, a Nazi leader who later fled to the U.S.

 In his 1939 book, Hitler Told Me, Rauschning described Hitler as controlled by “malefic influences of which he was no longer the master.” A chronic insomniac, Hitler’s sleeplessness became worse after 1934, his minimal sleep frequently interrupted by crying spells and night terrors. As recounted by Rauschning, during one of his night terrors:

“Hitler was standing there in his bedroom, stumbling about, looking around him with a distraught look. He was muttering: ‘It’s him! It’s him! He’s here!’ His lips had turned blue. He was dripping with sweat. Suddenly, he uttered some numbers which made no sense, then some words, then bits of sentences. It was frightening. He used terms which were strung together in the strangest way and which were absolutely weird. Then, he again became silent, although his lips continued to move. He was given a massage and something to drink. Then, all of a sudden, he screamed: ‘There! Over there! In the corner! Who is it?’ He was jumping up and down, and he was howling. They reassured him that everything was all right, and he gradually calmed down.”",conspiracy,C001c8,flat.earth

The picketed post supports an A3 white piece of paper with a message in black pen on the right side and two illustrations on the left.

'Do Research!!' the bulletin commands. 'YouTube: 200 Proofs Earth is NOT a Spinning Ball By Eric Duboy. Wake Up.'

The poster pinned to the wooden stick caught the eye of Dr Stephen Voss when he was out for a walk with his wife on Saturday afternoon.

'Spotted on our walk to Lawyers Head this afternoon, it appears that the flat earth society have infiltrated St Kilda,' Dr Voss posted to Facebook.

'Funny how they equate doing research with watching YouTube videos!'

The YouTube video was uploaded by a YouTube subscriber called Eric Dubay described on his account as a '34-year-old American living in Thailand'.

Over two hours the clip goes through '200 Flat Earth Proofs' and claims to be the largest collection of 'supposed spinning ball Earth proofs'.

Dr Voss said he couldn't tell how long the sign had been there, but as it looked minimally weathered he guessed it could have popped up overnight.

The general practitioner told Daily Mail Australia he had been aware of the 'flat Earth movement' for a couple of years and he was bemused to see it - immediately understanding the theory it was alluding to.

'I was just a little surprised to see it on my doorstep.

'My wife on the other hand had no idea there are people that genuinely believe the earth is flat and was initially confused by the sign,' Dr Voss said, who is also an enthusiastic amateur astronomer.

The incorrect declaration comes just two days after Youtube video blogger D Marble tried to prove the world isn't spherical by taking a spirit level onto a plane in a bizarre stunt.

He thought the pilot to tip the plane forwards to 'compensate for the curvature' of the earth - but when the spirit bubble remained central, he claimed it proved the world was flat.

But people have branded the flat-earther's stunt a 'perfect combination of brilliant and stupid' and suggested that he should have looked out of the window to see the curvature of the horizon.

The scientific explanation for why the bubble remained steady is that the plane nose did not dip because gravity was pulling it towards the earth and it was generating lift to pull away.",mainstream,M15ba8,flat.earth
1122,"With the region’s population booming because of the Pike’s Peak gold rush, Congress creates the new Territory of Colorado.

When the United States acquired it after the Mexican War ended in 1848, the land that would one day become Colorado was nearly unpopulated by Anglo settlers. Ute, Arapaho, Cheyenne, and other Native Americans had occupied the land for centuries, but the Europeans who had made sporadic appearances there since the 17th century never stayed for long. It was not until 1851 that the first permanent non-Indian settlement was established, in the San Luis Valley.

As with many other western regions, though, the lure of gold launched the first major Anglo invasion. In July 1858, a band of prospectors working streambeds near modern-day Denver found tiny flecks of gold in their pans. Since the gold-bearing streams were located in the foothills not far from the massive mountain named for the explorer Zebulon Pike, the subsequent influx of hopeful miners was termed the Pike’s Peak gold rush. By the spring of 1859, an estimated 50,000 gold seekers had reached this latest of a long series of American El Dorados.

As the first gold-bearing streams to be discovered played out, prospectors moved westward into the rugged slopes of the Rocky Mountains in search of new finds. Wherever sizeable deposits were discovered, ramshackle mining camps like Central City, Nevadaville, and Black Hawk appeared, sometimes almost overnight. Meanwhile, out on the flat plains at the edge of the mountains, Denver became the central supply town for the miners.

Although few miners came to Colorado planning to stay long, they were eager to establish some semblance of “law and order” in the region in order to protect their property rights and gold dust. Far from the seats of eastern government, the miners and townspeople cobbled together their own simple governments, usually revolving around a miners’ court that regulated claims. Technically lacking in any genuine legal foundation, the miners’ courts did maintain the minimal order needed for the mineral exploitation of the territory to continue.

The unreliable mining operations soon gave way to larger, highly capitalized and relatively permanent lode mining operations. The pioneers recognized that the vast mineral resources of the Rockies could form the foundation of a thriving new state, but the people settling there needed a more formal system of laws and government. The Congressional designation of new western states and territories had been bogged down for several years as southern and northern politicians fought over whether slavery would be permitted in the new western regions. By 1861, the South had seceded, clearing the way for the northern politicians to begin creating free-labor states.",mainstream,M14c47,flat.earth
275,"CNN admits the Health Ranger has been right all along: Sunscreen chemicals are absorbed into your bloodstream where they can promote cancer

The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), a branch of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has published the results of a pilot study looking at the safety of many common sunscreen products – and what was discovered is that sunscreen chemicals absorb into the bloodstream via the skin in a matter of hours.

As reported by CNN and others, the results of the study, which were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), reveal that, rather than evaporate or wash off, sunscreen chemicals persist and accumulate in people’s bodies through their skin, which is the body’s largest organ.

CDER looked at four common chemicals used in conventional sunscreen products: avobenzone, oxybenzone, ecamsule, and octocrylene. What the agency found is that concentrations of three of them continue to rise inside the body with each subsequent application, and persist there for at least 24 hours after sunscreen use has ceased.

According to the FDA, these four chemicals, as well as eight others that are also commonly used in many sunscreen products, need to be better researched by manufacturers before they can receive the FDA’s coveted designation of being “generally regarded as safe and effective.”

“It’s not news that things that you put on your skin are absorbed into the body,” says Scott Faber, senior vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group (EWG), a consumer advocacy group.

“This study is the FDA’s way of showing sunscreen manufacturers they need to do the studies to see if chemical absorption poses health risks.”

Natural News has been warning about dangerous sunscreen chemicals for more than a decade

As the FDA catches up with the times, it’s important to note that Natural News has been warning the public about the dangers and ineffectiveness of conventional sunscreen products for well over a decade.

As you may recall from back in 2007, we published The Sunscreen Myth, a comprehensive paper and CounterThink cartoon that goes into great detail about why the entire concept behind sunscreen supposedly protecting the skin against cancer is a myth – and the fact that many sunscreen products actually cause cancer.

The Sunscreen Myth also explains how sunscreen chemicals absorb directly through the skin and immediately enter the bloodstream, loading people’s bodies with all sorts of synthetic compounds that may or may not get effectively detoxified and excreted by the liver and other cleansing organs.

Like cigarette advertising from the past that claimed doctors favored smoking, the sunscreen hysteria of today is based on little more than fear-mongering and pseudoscience. Truth be told, our bodies need sunlight in order to generate immune-supportive vitamin D – a pro-hormone nutrient that’s effectively blocked by sunscreen.

“There is no need for sunscreen, but the cancer industry and sunscreen manufacturers have created a fictitious need through a campaign of fear and disinformation, hypnotizing practically the entire population into believing one of the most ridiculous ideas in the universe: that sunlight is bad for human health,” explains The Sunscreen Myth.

“They didn’t run and hide from the sun, they used it as nourishment to generate a crucial vitamin that supports human health in a multitude of ways. The idea that “the sun is bad for you” makes about as much sense as ‘water is bad for you’ or ‘the Earth is flat,'” it adds.

It is also recommended that readers check out “The Trouble with Ingredients in Sunscreen,” put out by EWG as a public educational resource.

1289,"When I was a child, my father was a family physician. Occasionally he talked about dreams with his patients or neighbouring peasants. Having overheard their chat, I joined in one day, saying, “I dreamed of walking on the street but I was aware that I was dreaming. So I was looking for some kind of bed to go back to sleeping. It was a frustrating experience trying to find a bed in the streets of a village. I finally came to a large dark stone with a smoothly polished flat surface. I fell asleep or out of the dream even before my body touched the stone.” They were all surprised by my dream, since lucid dreams are much less common for adults than children.

In a lucid dream, the dreamer is aware of the dreaming status. He or she therefore participates in or even manipulates the outcome of the dream. In my case, I wanted to end the dream, and eventually I did. A false awakening, in which the dreamer dreamed of getting up to work or to go to the washroom, is likely a lucid dream. A daydream may also be a lucid dream, if the dreamer goes far away from his waking state of mind and is unaware of his physical and social environments.

Since a lucid dreamer can often manipulate the imaginary experiences in the dream environment, lucid dreams can seem extremely real and vivid, depending on a person’s level of self-awareness during the lucid dream. Recently, various techniques have been developed to induce lucid dreams. Such techniques apparently reduce the frequency and severity of nightmares.

Both Buddhism and Taoism have long been known to introduce lucid dream experiences in order to calm down the believer’s mind. One sect of Buddhism goes further to classify the human mind or consciousness into seven levels of awareness. There are degrees of wakefulness or awareness, and both lucid dreaming and normal waking experiences lie somewhere towards the middle of this continuum (or hierarchy) of awareness. In this context as the Buddhist believes, there are therefore states of wakefulness that are superior to normal waking awareness, such as Nirvana, which Buddhists pursue in their religious practice. In such superior awareness, the reality of our ordinary world becomes illusory. Buddhism holds the view that life on earth is bitter in nature.



Closing his famous essay All Things Being Equal, Chuang Tzu says, “Chuang Tzu once dreamed that he was a butterfly fluttering here and there, going wherever he pleased. He was totally unaware of Chuang Tzu. A sudden awakening left nothing else but Chuang Tzu himself, who did not know anything about his being a bufferfly. It is therefore unknown whether it is Chuang Tzu who dreamed of being a bufferfly or if it is a butterfly who dreamed of being Chuang Tzu. The butterfly and Chuang Tzu are completely different entities, and it is called transformation when an entity becomes another.”

The same essay starts with a master who leaned on his armrest while sitting lost himself in meditation. Like Buddhists, Chuang Tzu and his followers apparently mastered the techniques of lucid dreams. In the essay, Joyful Free Wandering, Chuang Tzu starts with a legendary bird, Peng, which has a body and wings that cover hundreds of miles. It can fly three thousand miles high. Even this gigantic bird has to rely on air or wind to fly. It is far away from Chuang Tzu’s joyful free wandering, in which one goes to a vivid lucid dream at will, and relying on nothing else but himself. The dreamer can go anywhere he pleases. His dreaming experience is so vivid and real that lucid dreams are not different at all from reality as far as personal experiences are concerned. Buddhism pursues a superior ideal realm, Nirvana, which lies far beyond reality. Taoism holds the view that life on earth is so wonderful that it has to be prolonged to eternity. Taoists use lucid dreams to extend their enjoyment of life beyond the limits of reality.

Children slip into lucid dreams more easily than adults. Similarly prehistoric or primititve people have more lucid dreams. Further, Erika Bourguignon, from her study of almost 500 societies has shown that the frequency, accessibility and quality of religious experiences, correlate inversely with the complexity of social structure. In the simplest and most egalitarian societies, ritual trance states tend to be voluntary, conscious and accessible to most people who desire them. Scientifically “trance” is often termed as a transformed state of mind. It describes lucid dreams and different levels of awareness in Buddhist terms.

Levy-Bruhl’s book “Primitive Mentality” was influential for Julian Jaynes, an American psychologist, who believes that all humans lived in a hallucinatory state more than three thousand years ago. Levy-Bruhl writes: “In comparison to modern society, a greater number of individuals in primitive societies experiences hallucinations, experiences them more frequently, and the hallucinations play an important role in their day-to-day lives.” Levy-Bruhl states: “To them the things which are unseen cannot be distinguished from the things which are seen. The beings of the unseen world are no less directly present than those of the other; they are more active and more formidable. Consequently that world occupies their minds more entirely than this one, and it diverts their minds from reflecting, even to a slight extent, upon the data which we call objective.”

Both Levy-Bruhl and Erika Bourguignon indicated that hallucination was more common in ancient primitive people. But it only employed part of the idle mind in the primary society while it became the divine voice, in Julian Jaynes’ bicameralism, to dictate that the people should obey their rulers in a secondary society. When rational thinking reflecting on objective data establishes itself in modern society, hallucination or bicameralism remains only in psychotic patients.

Buddhism represents a religious tradition based on secondary societies, and so it teaches people how to retreat from the traumatizing reality by lucid dreams. Taoism is a religious tradition based on the primary society, and so it teaches people how to enjoy life more without any efforts by lucid dreams.

We’ve been fed a lot of disinformation about discoveries that would change the way we view the very nature of our reality and what it means to be human.

Discoveries that would have us ask the deep questions about life, our purpose, why we are here, and where we come from. Discoveries that would literally change human consciousness forever.

“We knew that the Earth was flat, we knew that we were the center of the universe, and we knew that a man-made heavier than air piece of machinery could not take flight. Through all stages of human history, intellectual authorities have pronounced their supremacy by ridiculing or suppressing elements of reality that simply didn’t fit within the framework of accepted knowledge. Are we really any different today?

“Have we really changed our acceptance towards things that won’g fit the frame? Maybe there are concepts of our reality we have yet to understand, and if we open our eyes, maybe we will see that something significant has been overlooked.” – Terje Toftenes (source)

This ‘something’ significant is the fact that we are not alone. Whether it be a former Chairman of the Royal Navy telling us that “there is a serious possibility that we are being visited, and have been visited by people from outer space,” or an Apollo 14 astronaut saying that “there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered,” we have no shortage of high-ranking insiders attesting to the reality that some UFOs may be extraterrestrial. There have been some very interesting leaks over the years that suggest the same thing.

General Carlos Cavero told the world in 1979, “everything” has been “in a process of investigation both in the United States and in Spain, as well as the rest of the world.” On a global scale, “the nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon” and there is “an international exchange of data.” (source)

Phobos II was the last space probe designed by the Soviet Union to explore the moons of Mars. Unexpectedly, we lost communication with it, and multiple insiders have said we weren’t told the truth about what really happened.

Today, UFOs are no longer taboo. For years, we’ve experienced, as I’ve said many times before, an “official campaign of ridicule and secrecy” (Ex-CIA Director Roscoe Hillenkoetter) of the phenomenon. The establishment in many ways was responsible for the foolish articles that would constantly appear in mainstream media publications, absolutely ridiculing a topic that is actually very real.

But the tables have now turned. One of the biggest mouthpieces for “the establishment,” The New York Times, admitted something that the establishment, or facets of it, have been concealing for years: UFOs are real.

A former high-ranking federal government employee, Christopher Mellon, also wrote a Washington post article that detailed a number of UFO encounters with the military with extreme credibility. But again, this isn’t new information.

In the 1950s, President Harry Truman went on national television announcing to the world that UFOs are real, and that they discuss the topic at every conference that they have with the military, that “there’s always things like that going on, flying saucers and they’ve had other things.” (source)

Official pictures and videos have also been released, for example, a photo taken by two Royal Canadian Air Force pilots on August 27th, 1956 in McCleod, Alberta, Canada is a great example. (“Physical Evidence Related To UFO Reports” – The Sturrock Panel Report – Electromagnetic Effects) (source) (source) You can see that picture here.

In this case, the pilots were flying in a formation of four F86 Sabre jet aircraft. One of the pilots described the phenomenon as a “bright light which was sharply defined as disk-shaped” that looked like “a shiny silver dollar sitting horizontal.” Another pilot managed to photograph the object, as you can see above.

The US Navy has acknowledged footage showing multiple UFOs that was released a couple of years ago by To The Stars Academy via The Pentagon, and they’ve recently confirmed that the videos are indeed real.

There are millions of pages of documents to go through, and thousands of statements from high ranking people that have been attesting to the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon for a very long time.

That being said, the topic is going ‘mainstream’ and it’s always important to note that the establishment, and media outlets like the New York Times, CNN etc have been intelligence agency mouthpieces. They have fed the world a lot of disinformation and the type of controlled disclosure we are seeing on this subject is probably no different.

There is much more going on than what we get from the mainstream – they always try to control the narrative for their own selfish purposes. It’s always important to keep that in mind for anybody who delves deep into this subject.

Are they trying to control the narrative and spread more disinformation? Are they trying to present a threat narrative in order to justify certain measures? Similar to how ‘terrorism’ was used and financed by the west to justify the infiltration and takeover of other countries in order to bring them ‘democracy?’

These are important questions to ask ourselves as this topic gains more popularity. What is presented by the mainstream is far from the available truth that’s already out there.",conspiracy,C0270e,flat.earth
296,"Stuart Turner (born Bournemouth, Dorset, England) is an English alternative blues singer. He now lives in Medway, Kent. Having released two solo albums, Turner formed the band Stuart Turner & The Flat Earth Society, who release their 5th album Scowl in the summer of 2017.

Though being an active musician for a number of years, and playing with a number of different local musicians, Turner's first official solo release came on Sun Pier Records, a Chatham based record label distributed by Cargo, and formed by friend and fellow musician Kris Dollimore, ex-guitarist with The Damned. Turner produced Dollimore's debut Sun Pier release (02/01/1978) in 2006, writing a song on it (""The North Kent Post Industrial Hillstomp Blues"") which received national airplay on BBC Radio Two. Turner's own solo appeared a few months later with his debut album, A Gallon of Water Makes a Mile of Fog, which one critic described as ""packed full of ideas"".[2] Turner supported Dollimore in gigs around England and spent 2006 and 2007 playing shows in a diverse selection of venues, including bowling alleys, cabaret clubs and Swedish festivals, which one reviewer described as ""scaring the living daylights out of the assembled crowd with his spooky folk blues"".[3] Turner's second album, File Under Carnal Knowledge, was described a freight train riding back bar room down at heel blues"",[4] and released on Sun Pier in February 2009.

Turner formed The Flat Earth Society with guitarist Robbie Wilkinson in 2009 to record what became the band's first album Gin & Bitters. Alongside Turner and Wilkinson in the original line-up were Ray Hunt on drums and Dave Sawicki on bass (with occasional trumpet from John Whitaker). The album was released on CD and digital download in July 2010, through the independent Brigadier Records. The band added ""steam driven power"" to his ""anguished urban blues"",[5] and provided the opportunity for live performances around the South East of England, including the Lounge On The Farm festival. Turner & The Flat Earth Society performed gigs to the end of 2010, including a Christmas ball at Oxford University. A live version of ""Murder On Gaslight Street"" was made available for free download via Medway Eyes in October 2010, whilst Brigadier Records released the Gin & Bitters album tracks, ""Shimmy"" and ""South Sea Blues"" as radio promos in December that year. Gin & Bitters was followed up with the limited vinyl EP release Weekend Hearts in 2011 before the band recorded On The Brink Of Misadventure, which was their final album release with Brigadier Records.

At this point, the band underwent some line-up changes, with a new line-up containing Turner, Wilkinson, Nick Rice (bass), Bob Collins (guitarist formerly with The Dentists), Rob Shepherd (from The Singing Loins on banjo, mandolin and accordion) and James Kerr recording a new album during 2013. At this point, the band began their association with Vacilando '68 Recordings in Autumn of 2013 and acquired publishing through Bucks Music Publishing. The new album, The Art and Science of Phrenology: a presentation by Stuart Turner and The Flat Earth Society was released by Vacilando '68 in February 2014.

Steve Moore replaced James Kerr as drummer in time for a new EP, The Gentleman's Club, released by Vacilando '68 in October 2014. Whilst recording what would become the band's 4th album, the band gigged extensively around the South East and London and started to make in-roads into the grass roots festival circuit, with an appearance at 2015's Bearded Theory festival a particular highlight. The 4th album, eponymously named, was released to critical acclaim by Vacilando '68 in April 2016 following a long period of artwork and pressing delays. The band had a two-page feature in Maverick Magazine.

With Mike Sewell replacing Steve Moore on drums, the band recorded their 5th album, to be released as Scowl in 2017. The album also features guest appearances from Rachel Lowrie and David Read (of The Claim). Some left-over songs from the album were released as a digital only release in February 2017.

31,"Nick Davies is a distinguished reporter who specialises in very long and depressing stories for The Guardian on subjects most other journalists prefer to leave untouched, such as poverty and the failings of the criminal justice system. He has now turned his virtuous investigative eye on his own profession. His reaction is almost spinsterish in its horror.

Davies' notion of what journalists and journalism are for is idiosyncratic, to put it mildly.

Whoever told him that this is an industry 'supposedly dedicated' - as he puts it in his prologue - 'to telling the truth'? Where did he get the idea that journalists should be, or ever have been, reluctant to lie, cheat, deceive and resort to low tricks of every kind?

In this survey of what he calls 'a corrupted profession', he hardly bothers with the tabloids. 'No one needs a book to tell them that the tabloids are an unreliable source of information about the world,' he comments with lordly condescension.

Sheltered from the rough world of daily hackery, he also disdains what he sees as the fictions of objectivity and neutrality. Journalists, Davies believes, must make judgments; the strong implication is that these should be between good and bad.

Much of his analysis is nevertheless compelling and alarming. On provincial papers, pitifully underpaid journalists spend their days rewriting press releases, while the proceedings in courts and councils go largely unreported. At all levels, the relentless pressure on staffing, combined with the demand for more and yet more 'news', have created a culture of dependence.

Journalists with no time either to find stories or to check the information they are given, are reduced to processing the unstoppable flow of material from the PR departments, the special interest groups, the pseudo-experts, the pseudo-researchers.

Davies convincingly chronicles the success of the CIA and MI6 in planting fictions across the supposedly independent media to get backing for false assessments of the dangers posed by Iraq and Iran. He argues that Greenpeace and other eco groups have been just as eager as the fossil-fuel lobby to distort and exaggerate the available science on global warming to further their own ends (although, curiously enough, Davies omits any reference to the willingness of his own newspaper to swallow the most extreme predictions of the coming catastrophe with scarcely a flicker of scepticism).

His last three chapters focus on The Sunday Times, The Observer, and The Daily Mail (The Sunday Telegraph does not draw Davies's fire).

It comes as little surprise to find that the Mail is prejudiced against blacks, homosexuals, immigrants, lefties, people on benefit and so on, and that it is unscrupulous in mobilising its money and power to hound them; or that Davies laments the passing of the old investigative tradition on The Sunday Times.

But his assault on The Observer is something else.

In the eyes of Guardian men like Nick Davies, their sister paper The Observer and its then editor, Roger Alton, committed an unforgivable offence in declaring support for the Iraq war. Davies directs a venomous attack on the integrity and professional competence of Alton and his political editor, Kamal Ahmed.

He portrays them as puppets of Alastair Campbell and Tony Blair, intent on turning the paper into a mouthpiece for the government's war policy, ready to suppress or bury any story that might raise doubts about Saddam Hussein's alleged arsenal.

Of Alton, Davies says: 'His passions are far from government, much closer to sport and women, both of whom he pursues with obsessive energy' - a comment so unpleasant that one begins to suspect some ancient personal grudge.

Davies deliberately underplays the extent to which Alton was prepared to allow time and space to the expression of anti-war sentiment; and ignores altogether the persistence with which The Observer criticised Blair and his ministers over their domestic record, and exposed their bullying, lies and deceptions.

If this travesty of what happened at The Observer represents Nick Davies's idea of good journalism, he can keep it.

Let's be charitable and regard it as an aberration, and concentrate instead on the valuable and disturbing insights that Davies provides into a business that needs to ask a good many questions of itself.

No one should expect journalists to be as high-minded as Nick Davies. Theirs is - or should be - a murky, occasionally mucky, job done by people short on scruples and long on curiosity, suspicious of everything and everybody, and of favours most of all.

Journalists don't need to be clean but they must be allowed to get the story, and they must have the confidence and courage to write it as they see it.

1158,"Image: CBC News: Sunday’sinterviews 9/11 Commission co-chair and co-author of the book “Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission”

Evan Solomon : Tell me why you felt the need, with Thomas Kean, to write this book “Without Precedent”?

Lee Hamilton : We felt we had an important story to tell, 9/11 was a traumatic event in our history, every adult in America will remember exactly where they were on that day when they heard the news. We felt that the Commission’s work gave a lot of insights into how government works, and particularly how government in the national security area works. We had hundreds of people tell us, or ask us, how the Commission did its work, and so we responded by writing the book and tried to let people know the story, the inside story of the 9/11 Commission.

Solomon : Do you consider the 9/11 Commission to have been a success, and if so, under what ways do you measure that success? How do you call it a success?

Hamilton : The 9/11 Commission was created by statute. We had two responsibilities – first, tell the story of 9/11; I think we’ve done that reasonably well. We worked very hard at it; I don’t know that we’ve told the definitive story of 9/11, but surely anybody in the future who tackles that job will begin with the 9/11 Commission Report. I think we’ve been reasonably successful in telling the story. It became a best seller in this country and people showed a lot of interest in it.

Our second task was to make recommendations; thus far, about half of our recommendations have been enacted into law, the other half have not been enacted. So we’ve got a ways to go. In a quantitative sense, we’ve had about 50% success there. In a qualitative sense, you could judge it many different ways. But we still have some very important recommendations that we think have not yet been enacted that should be.

Solomon : Now, one of the stipulations, you write in the book, one of the ways that you thought that this ought to be successful, this report, the Commission Report, is on page 23, you said if the American people would accept the results as authoritative, and the recommendations.

And when I measure that against a Zogby poll done in May, that says now 42% of Americans say that “the U.S. government, and its 9/11 Commission, concealed or refused to investigate critical evidence that contradicts the official explanation of September 11th, saying there’s a cover-up” – 42%, Mr. Hamilton – what does that say to you about the efficacy of the Commission’s report?

Hamilton : Well, it’s dispiriting, it’s an unusually high number, but if you look at polls judging government reports in the past – the Warren Commission, the reports on Kennedy assassination, even the reports on Abraham Lincoln’s assassination – you find a very high level of people who are skeptical. And you have that in this case.

When you conduct a major investigation, you cannot possibly answer every question, you just do the best you can. But for every question you leave unanswered, you create an opening to a conspiracy theory, and a good many of them have popped up here.

The only thing I ask in the future is that the conspiracy theory people do not apply a double standard. That is to say, they want us to make an airtight case for any assertion we make. On the other hand, when they make an assertion they do it often on very flimsy evidence.

But conspirators are always going to exist in this country. Tom Kean and I got a flavour of this everytime we’d walk through an audience – they would hand us notes, hand us papers, hand us books, hand us tapes, telling us to investigate this, that or the other. You cannot possibly answer all these questions, you just do the best you can.

Solomon : Some of the families have joined that chorus. We’ve talked to one father who says, ‘my son was killed by George W. Bush’, as if the government had foreknowledge of the attacks. What would you say to someone like him and other family members who have been dissatisfied with the explanation?

Hamilton : Many families supported the report – very strongly – and have been instrumental in helping us on the implementation stage. A lot of the people that have doubts about the report – not all of them – are strongly anti-Bush, for a variety of reasons. Many of them are just anti-government, in other words, they don’t believe anything the government says.

All I ask of these people is: give me your evidence. If you thought George Bush or Lee Hamilton or Tom Kean blew up those buildings, let’s see the evidence.

Solomon : I wouldn’t mind just.. there’s a few things, but I want to know, interestingly enough, if you’ve seen a film that’s so popular now on the internet, ten million people apparently have seen a film called Loose Change, which makes some startling allegations. It’s a film made by three very young students out of a New York University. Have you seen that movie, and if so, what are your thoughts on it?

Hamilton : I have not seen it.

Solomon : Yeah… 10 million people, I mean, some of them.. now, and it’s interesting that you write in one of your chapters, I think it’s Chapter 12, deals specifically with conspiracy theories. One of them, as you know – probably one of the most persistent – is that the buildings were brought down by controlled explosion, controlled demolition. One of the bits of evidence that is often cited is the collapse of World Trade Center Building Number 7, which was not hit by any plane. One question that people have is: why didn’t the Commission deal with the collapse Building 7, which some call the smoking gun? Why did this collapse at all?

Hamilton : Well, of course, we did deal with it. The charge that dynamite, or whatever, brought down the World Trade Towers, we of course looked at very carefully – we find no evidence of that. We find all kinds of evidence that it was the airplanes that did it.

Don’t take our word on that: the engineers and the architects have studied this thing in extraordinary detail, and they can tell you precisely what caused the collapse of those buildings. What caused the collapse of the buildings, to summarize it, was that the super-heated jet fuel melted the steel super-structure of these buildings and caused their collapse. There’s a powerful lot of evidence to sustain that point of view, including the pictures of the airplanes flying into the building.

Now, with regard to Building 7, we believe that it was the aftershocks of these two huge buildings in the very near vicinity collapsing. And in the Building 7 case, we think that it was a case of flames setting off a fuel container, which started the fire in Building 7, and that was our theory on Building 7.

Now we’re not the experts on this, we talked to the engineers and the architects about this at some length, and that’s the conclusion we reached.

Solomon : Let me just ask you one more question on that. One counter-argument – or there’s two, I guess – one is that that fire very rarely, and has never, forced buildings constructed like the World Trade Centers to ever collapse, because steel doesn’t melt at temperatures that can be reached through a hydro-carbon fire, and that there’s other.. in other words, there are countless cases of other buildings that have been on fire that have not collapsed.

Hamilton : – but not on fire through jet fuel, I don’t think you have any evidence of that. But here again, I’m not the expert on it. We relied on the experts, and they’re the engineers and the architects who examined this in very great detail.

Solomon : A question which has remained: Why did the debris of World Trade Center 7, of which nobody died there, so there was no real urgency to move the debris away, and that there have been questions: why wasn’t it examined closer? Why was essentially evidence from what could have been a crime scene – or was a crime scene – removed very quickly from there?

Hamilton : You can’t answer every question when you conduct an investigation. Look, you’ve to got to remember that on this day, chaos and confusion were the mark, and peoples’ overwhelming concern was to try to save as many lives as possible, not to explain why a particular building collapsed. So it’s not unusual to me that we, and the Commission – and anybody else, for that matter – cannot answer every question. I go back to what I say earlier: whenever you conduct an investigation, you cannot answer every question.

Solomon : But should the Commission have .. I guess the question some people keep asking, should the Commission have asked more questions about the removal of the debris?

Hamilton : Look, you can say that about almost every phase of our investigation, ‘you should have asked this, you should have asked that, you should have spent more time’ – you’re conducting an investigation, you have a time limit, you don’t have unlimited time, you have a budget limit, you cannot go down every track, you cannot answer conclusively every question.

The members of the families that you referred to a minute ago submitted 150 questions to us – we answered a good many of them, we didn’t answer them all. You come to a point in an investigation where you have to say to yourself, ‘what’s our responsibility, given the resources we have, how much can we do?’ And you end up with a lot of questions unanswered. Look, I ‘ve got a lot of unanswered questions in my mind.

Solomon : What are yours? What are your unanswered questions?

Hamilton : Well, at the top of my list happens to be a personal one, and that is, I could never figure out why these 19 fellas did what they did. We looked into their backgrounds. In one or two cases, they were apparently happy, well-adjusted, not particularly religious – in one case quite well-to-do, had a girlfriend. We just couldn’t figure out why he did it. I still don’t know. And I think one of the great unanswered questions – a good topic for investigative reporters – would be: why did these 19 do what they did? We speculated in the report about why the enemy hates us, but we simply weren’t able to answer the questions about the 19.

Solomon : You know, just on that point, and again, there are so many of these questions about the 19. There have been some questions about – and I’m talking about sources here like the London Times and Le Figaro, sort of major newspapers – that some of these guys, some of these hijackers were still alive after the day of the event, that there are reports of their whereabouts. What did the Commission make of those kind of reports?

Hamilton : (Laughs) What’s the evidence? Look, I had a woman come up to me who said she was a lover of Mohammed Atta. And I said, ‘do you know that he’s dead?’ And she said, ‘I’m his lover.’ .. (raises eyebrows)

You get all kinds of comments like this, you can’t trace everything down.

Solomon : Where there any notion there was… The NTSB recently released the flight path of United Flight 93 in the past two weeks. One of the interesting things that that showed was, during the flight path, and I think the flight path of that, I think that plane crashed, according to the Report, at 10:03 am.

And one of the interesting things it showed – this is just recently declassified – that it flew well over 10,000 feet – 30,000, 40,000 feet – from about 9:30 onward. Now, a lot of the cell phone calls that were made from that plane, that ended up being in the movie, were from, you know, people phoning from the plane. And one allegation that’s recently come out since the release of that is: cell phones don’t work above 10,000 feet, so how could people get on their cell phone on a plane and phone their relatives?

Hamilton : I’m no expert on that. I’ve been told cell phones work – sometimes – above 10,000 feet, and as high as 30,000 feet. So it may have been that some of the calls went through and some didn’t, I just don’t know.

Solomon : Let me ask you another thing. I’m just asking because, you know, in the wake of this, there’s lots of these questions.

Solomon : The Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, which is about 20 odd miles away from New York, they released a report on seismic data coming from Manhattan on that day. And they released a spike in seismic data at 8:46:26, and they thought that was the moment of impact of the plane on the first World Trade Center, of American Airlines 11. But the plane didn’t hit until 8:46:40, and there are several of the same kind of early seismic spikes for the second flight. I guess the question is: how do we explain those discrepancies? When the public looks at that, how can we explain that kind of thing?

Hamilton : I haven’t seen that report. I don’t know the answer to your question. They didn’t come forward with that evidence while we were at the Commission – so far as I know. Now, staff filtered a lot of these things, so not necessarily would I know. I don’t know what happened with regard to the…. What did they conclude? I don’t know what they concluded.

Solomon : They had no conclusion; the evidence is sitting out there. You write about, in Chapter 12 of the book – and again it’s one of those allegations that have come up – about who had foreknowledge of it? One piece of evidence that many critics have said is: ‘well, there is lots of ‘puts’ – which is a form of financial stock trading. In other words, people are buying up stock, hoping that the airline stock would plunge, and there was an unusually large number of puts on American Airlines and United stock, and therefore people profited from this. What did you make of that theory?

Hamilton : That’s one we did investigate. We looked at that pretty carefully, and all I can indicate at this point is that we do not think anybody profited from manipulation of airline stock prior to 9/11, there’s no evidence of that, I don’t think.

Hamilton : That’s correct. It’s not unusual in the stock market to have a lot of activity in a given stock, or industry, as you did here. The question is: did any of them have foreknowledge and profit from it? We don’t think so; we looked at it pretty carefully.

Solomon : There’s also allegations that the Pakistani Secret Service, called the ISI, the head of which met here in the United States right before 9/11, and there’s some allegations and evidence to show that they paid Mohammed Atta $100,000. The reason this is important is: who funded the people who conducted the attacks, the terrorist attacks? What did the Commission make of payment from the ISI to Mohammed Atta of $100,000?

Hamilton : I don’t know anything about it.

Solomon : Was there any connection between.. Did the Commission investigate any connection between ISI, Pakistani intelligence, and..

Hamilton : They may have; I do not recall us writing anything about it in the report. We may have but I don’t recall it. We did estimate that Osama bin Laden spent about $500,000 for the 9/11 attacks. We did not identify all the sources of that money.

Solomon : And how it got to the …

Hamilton : That’s right, you simply can’t trace it, so far as I know, because $500,000 in international financial markets is not even a blip on the radar screen. So we do not know precisely where that money came from.

Solomon : Questions about foreknowledge, especially as to when Vice President Dick Cheney knew when he went down to the protective bunker: there was some suggestion that the Secretary of Transport Mineta testified in front of the Commission that he in fact talked to Dick Cheney at 9:20 am. Cheney claims he hadn’t been there.. gotten down there until close to 10 am. That was eventually omitted from the final report,. Can you tell us a bit about about what Secretary of Transport Mineta told the Commission about where Dick Cheney was prior to 10 am?

Solomon : And we don’t know exactly where that..

Hamilton : Well, we think that Vice President Cheney entered the bunker shortly before 10 o’clock. And there is a gap of several minutes there, where we do not really know what the Vice President really did. There is the famous phone call between the President and the Vice President. We could find no documentary evidence of that phone call. Both the President and the Vice President said that the phone call was made, and in that phone call, the order was supposedly was given, allegedly given, to shoot down an airliner – if necessary

Now, there are a lot of things not answered about that period of time. The order never got to the pilots and when it did get to the pilots, it didn’t get to them in time, and when it did get to them, they claimed it was not an order to shoot it down, but to identify and track an airliner, not to shoot it down.

What you had on this day, of course, was a lot of confusion, and a lot of confusion in communications, at the very highest levels. When the President went from the school in Sarasota to Air Force One, he was trying to get communications with the White House, he used a cell phone, in part. When he got to Air Force One, the communications didn’t work all that well. Well, this is all very disturbing, and I’m told has now been corrected.

Solomon : Disturbing in what way?

Hamilton : Well, disturbing that, at this particular time, the Commander in Chief lost communications with the White House, and with his chief aides there, right in the middle of a crisis – that’s very disturbing. I hope that’s been corrected, I’ve been told that it has been. But the fact of the matter is, if you look at 9/11, all the way through, FAA communications, NORAD communications, White House communications, there was just a lot of confusion, and a lot of gaps.

Solomon : So, just in terms of Mineta, just because I think that’s sort of interesting, when Secretary Mineta made at your Commission hearing, I think he did this May 23rd, that he arrived and talked to Dick Cheney at 9:20 – that would show that Mr. Cheney had had some earlier knowledge that planes had been hijacked and they wanted to take action. That was not –

Hamilton : What did the Secretary say at that time to the Vice President?

Solomon : They talked about a plane being hijacked, according to the testimony that I’ve seen, according to the Mineta report. But there’s another one, in Richard Clarke’s book, “Against All Enemies”, and I know Richard Clarke took the stand very famously – not the stand, but testified before the Commission very famously – he says he received authorization from Dick Cheney to shoot down Flight 93 at about 9:50 am. In the Commission’s Report, it said the authorization didn’t come from Dick Cheney until 10:25, and Richard Clarke’s testimony that he and his book, isn’t mentioned in the Commission’s .. Why didn’t you mention that?

Hamilton : Look, you’ve obviously gone through the report with a fine-toothed comb, you’re raising a lot of questions – I can do the same thing…

Hamilton : ..all I want from you is evidence. You’re just citing a lot of things, without any evidence to back them up, as far as I can see.

Solomon : No, I’m just asking why they weren’t –

Hamilton : I don’t know the answer to your question.

Solomon : I guess part of the reason is..

Hamilton : I cannot answer every question with regard to 9/11. I can answer a good many of them, but I can’t answer them all.

Solomon : I guess, Mr. Hamilton, I don’t think anyone expects you to have all the answers…

Hamilton : Well, you apparently do, because you have asked me questions of enormous detail from a great variety of sources. You want me to answer them all – I can’t do it (laughs)

Solomon : I guess part of the reason is I want to know, not necessarily what the answer is, but if the Commission considered, you know, what made it into the report, in terms of the discussion. And of course, what we’re trying to understand is, if the commission simply said ‘you know, those kinds… there was huge amounts of data, and we couldn’t put everything in’.

So I guess, you know, in questions about what happened on 9/11 as we approach the fifth anniversary of that day, and this being the kind of most extensive document that the public has, there are questions as to what made it in and what you heard, and what you didn’t. And that, I think, those are the nature of the questions.

Hamilton : Yeah. A lot of things that came to the attention of staff did not come to the attention of the Commission. Some of the things did come to the attention of the Commission, and we didn’t put ’em in, or at least we put ’em in at a lower level. But many of the things did not come directly to my attention.

Solomon : Part of what you write in the book is that one of the key goals here was to be as transparent and as open as possible, because you say ‘without light, the conspiracy theorists jump in.’

Solomon : Now, one place that you shed a lot of light on – and you write about it in this book [“Without Precedent”] as well – is a place where conspiracy theorists, as you call them, have jumped in, which is the plane that hit the Pentagon. As you and I both know, there’s a number of publications that [say] the hole in the Pentagon was too small to accomodate a plane of that, you know, 125 foot wingspan, 40 feet high, and that it was a missile. What did you make – what did the Commission, when it heard all those kind of ideas, how did you consider those, and what investigation went on around those?

Hamilton : Well, we said an airplane went into the Pentagon. And we said that jet fuel there too caused an awful lot of the damage and the injury. We had one member of the staff who had been badly, badly burned by jet fuel, and as you know, jet fuel causes specific kinds of burns, and these burns were from jet fuel. So all of our evidence indicated a plane went in, and that’s what the eyewitnesses said that we saw.

Solomon : And you know, this notion – and this is maybe one of the most popular theories, and you see it all over – is that reports initially came back from the Pentagon that there was no debris at all, that the plane simply disintegrated inside the Pentagon. To those people, those of us who have seen aviation accidents, that sounded in some ways difficult to believe, because there was such a huge plane, and the maneuvre that it would require the pilot to make would have been, you know, to fly into it seemed so astonishing. What did the commission make of the debate, such as it is, that surrounds that?

Hamilton : We thought it was an airplane

Solomon : Was there any debris?

Hamilton : My recollection is, the answer’s yes. Was there a lot of debris? I don’t think so. To say that there was no debris strains my recollection, I didn’t remember it that way, I thought there was some debris. But you know, you have relatively little experience with planes highly loaded with jet fuel crashing, (chuckles) and reconstructing exactly what happened on the basis of the crash. We did the best we could on it. We thought it was an airplane.

There were a number of eyewitnesses, of course, who saw the plane go into the Pentagon, a number of people, for example, who were driving on the roadway – I forget the number of it right now – who had the airplane fly over their cars into the building, and they stopped their car, and saw the plane going into the Pentagon – that was not one, that was a number of eyewitnesses. We relied upon that, of course.

Solomon : And you know, when you.. You’ve spoken with many of the witnesses, your Commission heard testimony from all sorts of different people. So when you hear these kind of ongoing allegations that there was conflicting reports of the witnesses; that the FBI confiscated tapes from the gas station across the road, that supposedly saw it within a day of it; that some of those witnesses disappeared.. what do you make of those kind of…

Hamilton : I don’t believe for a minute that we got everything right. We wrote a first draft of history. We wrote it under a lot of time pressure, and we sorted through the evidence as best we could.

Now, it would be really rather remarkable if we got everything right. So far, of the things that have been brought up challenging the report, to my knowledge, we have more credibility than the challenger. But I would not for a moment want to suggest that that’s always true, either in the past or in the future. People will be investigating 9/11 for the next hundred years in this country, and they’re going to find out some things that we missed here.

So I don’t automatically reject all the evidence you cite. It may be we missed it, it may be we ignored it when we shouldn’t have – I don’t think we did, but it’s possible.

Solomon : You write.. the first chapter of the book is ‘the Commission was set up to fail.’ – my goodness, for the critics – who suggest that it was indeed set up to fail as some kind of obfuscation – you certainly dangled a juicy piece of bait out there in the river. Why do you think you were set up to fail?

Hamilton : Well, for a number of reasons: Tom Kean and I were substitutes – Henry Kissinger and George Mitchell were the first choices; we got started late; we had a very short time frame – indeed, we had to get it extended; we did not have enough money – 3 million dollars to conduct an extensive investigation. We needed more, we got more, but it took us a while to get it.

We had a lot of skeptics out there, who really did not want the Commission formed. Politicians don’t like somebody looking back to see if they made a mistake. The Commission had to report right, just a few days before the Democratic National Convention met, in other words, right in the middle of a political campaign. We had a lot of people strongly opposed to what we did. We had a lot of trouble getting access to documents and to people. We knew the history of commissions; the history of commissions were they.. nobody paid much attention to ’em.

So there were all kinds of reasons we thought we were set up to fail. We decided that if we were going to have any success, we had to have a unanimous report, otherwise the Commission report would simply be filed.

Solomon : I guess the question is, you know, if forty odd million dollars were spent investigating President Bill Clinton’s sexual infidelities, why did the American people and the world have to wait 441 days for a commission that was originally budgeted for 3 million dollars and given barely a year, and as you write in the book and document so well, was… had to fight to get access to even use its subpoena power very judiciously, for fear that there’d be a backlash against the Commission. I mean, an event as cataclysmic as 9/11, it begs the question: why was the administration so unwilling to budget this thing, and then Congress so unwilling to give money and let you guys go whole hog to do more?

Hamilton : (Laughs) I think basically it’s because they were afraid we were going to hang somebody, that we would point the finger, right in the middle of a presidential campaign – ‘Mr. Bush, this was your fault’ – or even Mr. Clinton. President Clinton was wary about this report too.

Now I want to say, eventurally both presidents cooperated, but it took a while. And it’s not too unusual for me to understand that they were skeptical. A commission that is created does not have automatic credibility – we had to work at that, we had to produce a lot of reports which were recognized, fortunately, to be professionally done, seriously done – and not out to hang anybody.

Solomon : Sorry, but why not out to hang anybody? This idea, ‘they didn’t want to point fingers’, that you weren’t out to ‘hang anybody’.. Good God, I thought the families were saying, ‘let’s find out not just what happened, but who is accountable’ – you know, that famous testimony of Richard Clarke, in front of your commission, when he said, “I failed you.” Weren’t people wanting you to point fingers and make someone accountable?

Hamilton : Yes I think they were. And we say, in the book, that there was a thirst for accountability. Now, part of that thirst was just to tell the story. This traumatic event occurs and they wanted to understand why it occurred, and we tried to tell that as best we could.

Government’s not very good at looking back and criticizing itself, and one of the things that impressed us over and over again, as we talked to one agency after the other, is: they had not really met and turned this over in their mind; government is always operating on the Inbox, and we were critical of almost every agency, in not looking back and asking what went wrong. So I think that’s a powerful factor in government, and…

Solomon : It does also suggest – I mean, there is that factor – but you know, what the public often.. now, and again, I talk about the 9/11 families, who were so instrumental in getting the Commission going..

Solomon : They said, ‘listen, is one of the reasons they’re not getting funded, and it’s so late, is that someone’s got something to hide.

Hamilton : There is… well, a lot of people have things to hide.

Solomon : Well who in this case?

Hamilton : Look, you can go down the list and probably identify a hundred people who made mistakes that day: t he ticket-taker at the Boston Logan airport; the customs official who let these fellows in, not one but many times, right up to Bill Clinton or George Bush.

Solomon : What were their errors?

Hamilton : They didn’t pay enough attention to terrorism. They didn’t treat it with enough urgency. They didn’t really anticipate this, even though there were many voices, you mentioned Richard Clarke a few times, who were clearly urging them ‘do it’ – he served both presidents.

What we decided was two things: the mandate did not ask us to identify people or even did not use the word ‘accountability’. We did not want to go beyond our mandate.

Secondly, what we thought was really important in all of this was not so much that a particular person failed in their responsibility, whatever that responsibility might be, but that there were systemic problems in the government that we really thought need to be identified and corrected.

We believe that, had we gone into the question of identifying a hundred people here who goofed up on 9/11, or prior to 9/11, and did not do their job responsibly, we would have gone outside the mandate of the Commission, we would absolutely have destroyed any opportunity for unanimity of view, because the Commission would have bogged down with whether Jim Smith or Sally Jones had done their job right, and that’s an unending task.

Solomon : In retrospect, one of the criticisms that you level in this book “Without Precedent” is aimed at both the FAA and NORAD, both of whom representatives testified before the Commission, and both of whom gave what to me – and I’m allowed to be much more impolite than you – sounded to me like lies. They told you testimony that simply… the tapes that were subsequently.. that have subsequently been revealed, were simply not true.

Solomon : And it wasn’t just lies by ommission, in some senses lies of commission, they told you things that basically didn’t happen. What do you make of that?

Hamilton : Well, I think you’re right. They gave us inaccurate information. We asked for a lot of material and a lot of documentation. They did not supply it all. They gave us a few things. We sent some staff into their headquarters. We identified a lot more documents and tapes, they eventually gave them to us, we had to issue a subpoena to get them.

Eventually they told us we had the story right, they had it wrong, it took a while to get to that point, but we eventually got here. Did they lie to us or was it inadvertent? We are not a law enforcement agency, we did not have that kind of authority, going back to the mandate again. All of us had our suspicions here, but we simply did not have the staff and we were right up against the deadline when this came out, that we didn’t have the time to say that these officials had willfully and intentionally lied.

So we punted – and we said, ‘we can’t do this, we don’t have the statutory authority, we don’t have the staff’, we don’t have the time’. We will tell the story as we understood it – they did mislead us. Was it wilful? We don’t know. We’ll turn it over to the authorities, and that’s what we did.

Hamilton : They are now still investigating.

Solomon : The recently released transcripts of what happened at NEADS, which is the Northeast Air Defence, paints a startling picture of confusion.

Hamilton : I think that’s the right word: enormous confusion, two of these airplanes that crashed were never identified. At one point, they had the American military jets chasing a phantom jet out in the Atlantic Ocean – in other words, going in the wrong direction.

The military had very little warning, I think, 2 minutes on one plane and 11 minutes on the other, if my recollection serves me right, and the disappointing thing here is that our, in a sense, first line of defense didn’t work.

Solomon : So is the story – and again, and I talk about those polls, 42% of Americans – your report very much… and subsequent things that have been released, subsequent tapes from places like NORAD, the air defence systems, suggest a mass failure of the first line of defense, which is incompetence and confusion which led to the lack of prevention of this.

Solomon : Now what happens when you get on to these [talk radio] shows, and you talk about that, and you get every – because you understand that the landscape is now littered with that stuff. What do you say to all these reports that are coming in – constantly?

Hamilton : I think people do not sufficiently understand how complicated conducting a major investigation is, and how difficult it is, in an event of this kind, to chase down every answer to every question, and… Look, I can go before any audience in America today and I can raise so many questions about 9/11 – raise questions, not answer questions, raise questions – about the investigation. And everbody in the audience will walk out saying ‘the government misled us or lied to us.’ It’s a very easy thing to do! I can raise questions about our own report!

Solomon : Like what? What would you raise?

Hamilton : Well, like I just said, about the 19 hijackers, we didn’t answer that question.

We had to tell that story as best we could, and we did, and we made a lot of judgments about the credibility of evidence. Were we right in every case? I suspect not. Were we right in most cases? I think so.

I do not know at this point of any factual error in our report, that I would absolutely say ‘we just plain missed it.’ Now, maybe I need to review it more carefully, but I cannot recall right now at this instance any fact that we just plain missed.

Solomon : Not that you got wrong, but the fact that was omitted?

Hamilton : Well, I know there were a lot of questions that we could not answer, with regard to FAA and NORAD and White House activity, and a lot of other things, we just can’t answer ’em.

Solomon : Is there anything in retrospect.. I mean, your deadline was so tight, and you say that forced you to make some very tough decisions as to how far ranging the investigation could be. In retrospect, if you’d had more time, what would you have investigated more thoroughly?

Hamilton : I would have, I think we spent – if I were critiquing the work of the Commission – I think we spent too much time on the question of access. And I would have liked to have gotten that over with, say, in the first half of the Commission’s work, so that we could have spent more time in putting the story together, maybe trying to answer some of the questions you raise that I can’t answer – and polishing the recommendations.

But you don’t… everything doesn’t go like you want it to go, and we were fighting the question of access right up to the end of the Commission’s work.

Solomon : One last thing before we go: you had, of course, Vice President Dick Cheney and President George Bush testify together – not under oath, with no transcript that would be made to the public. For a lot of the family members, and a lot of the public, they thought ‘so many other people testified under oath, so many other people had public testimony – why not the President and the Vice President?’ That again looked as though they were trying to obfuscate or hide something – what’s your view on that?

Hamilton : I don’t remember any time that a President of the United States, on a non-criminal matter, testified under oath. I do recall when President Johnson was asked to testify to the Warren Commission, he just flat out told him, ‘I am not going to do it. Presidents of the United States don’t do that sort of thing.’

Hamilton : He wrote a letter. Now, we asked President Bush and Vice President Cheney to testify, they said no. We went back to it, we said, ‘look, we will have no credibility as a commission if we do not hear from you.’

They considered that. They came back to us and said, ‘we will talk to you – Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton – but not the other commissioners.’ We said that was not satisfactory, ‘you had to talk to all ten of the Commission.’ I go into this detail just to tell you there was a long course of negotiation here.

Eventually they said they would both testify – not testify but meet with us – all ten commissioners – in the White House. There would be note takers, but no transcript taken. Tom and I asked the question, ‘can we get the information we need under this arrangement? We answered that ‘yes’.

In the actual appearance with the President and the Vice President, they were exceedingly co-operative. The president sat there for four hours and responded to questions.

At one point, Tom Kean interrupted one of the Commissioners, Richard Ben-Veniste, as I think we tell in the book, and said, ‘Richard, we have got to respect the President’s time.’ And the President said, ‘look, I’m in charge here, I’ll take the time, and let Richard ask his questions.’

We felt like we got a very extended long period of time with the president. He was completely candid. He did almost all the talking. Vice President Cheney talked only with reference to what happened at the White House on 9/11, because the President was not in the White House then, and took any question we had, and we had a lot of questions.

Solomon : Do you wish there was a public transcript of that?

Hamilton : If we had our preference, would there be a public transcript? It’s fine with me. But it was a White House call.

Solomon : I just want to clarify something that you said earlier. You said that the Commission Report did mention World Trade Center Building 7 in it, what happened. It did mention it or it didn’t?

Hamilton : The Commission reviewed the question of the Building 7 collapse. I don’t know specifically if it’s in the Report, I can’t recall that it is, but it, uh..

Solomon : I don’t think it was in the report.

Hamilton : OK, then I’ll accept your word for that.

Solomon : There was a decision not to put it in the report?

Hamilton : I do not recall that was a specific discussion in the Commission and we rejected the idea of putting Building 7 in, I don’t recall that. So I presume that the report was written without reference to Building 7 at all, because all of the attention, of course, was on the Trade tower buildings.

Solomon : And the black boxes on the planes: one bit of evidence I just got asked about, if it came up, was: the last 3 minutes of the black box on Flight 93 has not been made public or is missing, or I don’t know what’s happening. Was there any discussion as to what happened to those last three minutes?

Hamilton : I do not recall any reference to the black box.

Solomon : Were they all found?

Hamilton : I do not know, off hand, I do not know.

Solomon : Mr. Hamilton, I want to thank you so much for taking the time..

Solomon : ..and for discussing the book. What’s the reaction, by the way, from the families to this book?

Hamilton : Well, the families are a lot of different people. And many of them have been very enthusiastic. I understand there is a book coming out which will be quite critical of the work of the 9/11 Commission.

You had all kinds of reactions among the families: some people would just want to forget the whole thing and move on with their lives – people react differently to tragedy. Others, as you know, were enormously supportive of the Commission. Some began very supportive of the Commission, and became critical of what we did, and and they ended up not liking our recommendations – I don’t know that they criticized the report itself so much. But everybody has a… When you say ‘the families’, it includes a lot of different attitudes and viewpoints.

Solomon : What keeps you up at night about 9/11 still?

Hamilton : Not very much, I’ve turned my attention now to homeland security, and a lot of things bother me there.",conspiracy,C014c6,flat.earth

• The legendary investor Warren Buffett avoids making predictions, but we've gathered 12 of his best guesses about cryptocurrency, table tennis, and even his own death.
• We've detailed each prediction and assessed its accuracy in the slideshow below. The legendary investor Warren Buffett knows better than to make predictions. ""We have no idea - and never have had - whether the market is going to go up, down, or sideways in the near- or intermediate-term future,"" he wrote in his 1986 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. Yet the Oracle of Omaha couldn't resist making a few guesses about the future over the years. We've gathered 12 of his most intriguing predictions and assessed their accuracy in the slideshow below.

""In terms of cryptocurrencies generally, I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending,"" Buffett said in an interview with CNBC in January 2018. ""Now, when it happens or how or anything else, I don't know."" He added: ""If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I'd be glad to do it, but I would never short a dime's worth."" Buffett has been right about cryptocurrencies so far. At the time of his prediction, bitcoin traded above $14,000. The cryptocurrency slumped below $4,000 by the end of 2018, and it's now trading at about $5,200.

""Ships will sail around the world, but the Flat Earth Society will flourish,"" Buffett said in a speech at Columbia's business school in May 1984. Buffett may have been making a point about stubborn denialism in financial markets, but his prediction about so-called flat-earthers was correct - they've enjoyed a resurgence in recent years.

""It is fitting that the visit of Halley's Comet coincided with this percentage gain: neither will be seen again in my lifetime,"" Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 1985 after the conglomerate grew its net worth by 48.2%. He also predicted that the 23.2% compounded annual growth in the company's per-share book value that year was ""another percentage that will not be repeated."" It took nearly 20 years for Buffett to prove himself wrong on the first count. Berkshire Hathaway's net worth jumped by 48.3% in 1998, though that was largely because the company issued shares for acquisitions. ""Normally, a gain of 48.3% would call for handsprings - but not this year,"" he told investors. Buffett's second prediction was way off the mark. Berkshire Hathaway's per-share book value rose by 23.3% in 1986. It has also grown by at least 23.2% in more than 10 other years since 1985.

Buffett told students at the University of Kansas in May 2005 that Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert would struggle to revitalize the department-store chain. He warned that rivals such as Walmart and Costco could undercut Sears, which had just been acquired by Kmart. ""Eddie is a very smart guy, but putting Kmart and Sears together is a tough hand,"" Buffett said. ""Turning around a retailer that has been slipping for a long time would be very difficult."" Buffett was right on the money. Sears filed for bankruptcy protection in October. However, some hope remains: Lampert recently won court approval to buy the 126-year-old retailer out of bankruptcy and escape liquidation.

""We expect to keep permanently our three primary holdings, Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., Geico Corporation, and The Washington Post,"" Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in his 1986 letter. ""Even if these securities were to appear significantly overpriced, we would not anticipate selling them, just as we would not sell See's or Buffalo Evening News if someone were to offer us a price far above what we believe those businesses are worth,"" he added. Despite his best intentions, Buffett can't resist a great deal. Berkshire Hathaway sold its stake in Capital Cities/ABC to The Walt Disney Company in 1996 in a cash-and-stock deal worth $2.5 billion. He also flogged his company's 28% stake in The Post to Graham Holdings in a deal worth more than $1.1 billion in 2014, according to the newspaper. The Graham family sold The Post to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a $250 million deal in 2013. Berkshire Hathaway remains a major investor in Geico, See's Candies, and The Buffalo News.

""In 1988 we made major purchases of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Pfd. ('Freddie Mac'),"" Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in his letter that year. ""We expect to hold these securities for a long time. In fact, when we own portions

 of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever."" Luckily for Buffett, he changed his mind. Berkshire Hathaway sold nearly all its Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae shares in 2000, slashing its holding to 0.3% from 8.6% in 1999. Buffett told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010 that he had become ""concerned"" about the companies' management. ""They were trying to and proclaiming that they could increase earnings per share in some low double-digit range or something of the sort,"" he said. ""And any time a large financial institution starts promising regular earnings increases, you're going to have trouble, you know?""

""No sensible observer - not even these companies' most vigorous competitors, assuming they are assessing the matter honestly - questions that Coke and Gillette will dominate their fields worldwide for an investment lifetime,"" Buffett wrote in his 1996 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. ""Indeed, their dominance will probably strengthen. Both companies have significantly expanded their already huge shares of market during the past ten years, and all signs point to their repeating that performance in the next decade."" Buffett's claims have proved sound so far: Both Coke and Gillette remain the biggest players in their markets, though the latter is under mounting pressure. Coca-Cola's share of the US soft-drinks market was 41% in 1991, compared with Pepsi's 33%, and outsold its archrival fourfold in overseas markets, according to The New York Times. Its share of the global carbonated-beverage market was nearly 49% in 2015, according to Statista. In contrast, Gillette's market share has fallen from about 70% in 2010 to 54% in 2016 in the face of fierce competition from startups including the Unilever-owned Dollar Shave Club and Harry's, according to a report from the data-tracking firm Euromonitor cited by The Wall Street Journal.

Buffett is notoriously skeptical that the good times will continue. In Berkshire Hathaway's 1999 letter to shareholders, Buffett and Charlie Munger, his partner, deemed it a ""virtual certainty"" that the S&P 500 would ""do far less well in the next decade or two than it has done since 1982."" Buffett was right that the S&P's stellar average total return of just over 19% from 1982 to 1999 wouldn't last. The index returned an average of 1.2% over the next decade, according to SlickCharts, recovering to a respectable 12.2% from 2010 to 2018.",mainstream,M0f132,flat.earth

The founder of the closed Facebook group, John Perri, said: “Over the past several months, flat earth has not only opened my eyes to truth, but has liberated my mind with a new vision. “It is a journey, a discovery and a revealing of what has been hidden.” Members of the flat-earth match-making group come from all over the world - including the US, the Philippines, Uganda, Australia, Germany, Canada, Ecuador, Brazil and even the UK.

The members are very active, with 444 posts in the last month, and the numbers are growing every day. Some members discuss how difficult it is to date as a flat-earther. One male member said: “First of all she has to know the earth is flat. So 90 percent of all females on Earth are out already. “When I meet someone, I usually start by checking if they are aware of chemtrails.

“If they are not (most aren’t) then there’s no way I can come up with the shape of the Earth.” Another member replied: “I had a guy I was talking to for almost a month walk out of my house laughing at me when I told him the Earth is flat.” However, the dating group has worked for at least one lucky couple - the founder of the group and his flat-earth girlfriend, who is moving state to be nearer her new partner. She said: “I walked out of my job, packed as much of my stuff as I could in my Mustang and left for Michigan.

“35 years into my life’s story I will begin to live for the first time. New job, new state, new home, amazing flat-earth man.” But the group is more than just dating, according to Mr Perri, it is also to build a community around a common belief. You are only allowed to join if you believe the Earth is flat and if you introduce yourself within two days of being added - this is due to spammers and trolls targeting the group. Mr Perri said: “We are a family and growing community of believers united together under the banner of truth as we are bonded by the same commonality.

“We are a safe and fun zone for the like-minded to potentially meet the love of your life, to grow in knowledge and to establish and strengthen new friendships.” The community share links and videos to subjects around the flat-earth theory and discuss it between them. One member posted a picture of the horizon from the top of Kilimanjaro, the caption reading: “Nice straight horizon that one.” They also discuss other unconventional beliefs, including that Disney, Harry Potter and Transformers are evil, that partaking in Hallowe’en is wrong and even that meat has healing powers.",mainstream,M0769f,chemtrails; flat.earth

No. I say that because I tried it. Look, I’m the guy that wrote “Triad.” I tried it, believe me. I tried it every which way. What happens is we’re imperfect beings and we get jealous of each other and if you’re going with two different girls, one of them is going to get jealous of the other one. It happens almost every time. I know people that have done it for a number of years and they have balanced each other. But generally, when a guy wants an open marriage, he just means he wants to get laid and he wants permission to scout around and hit on other girls. You can’t do that. It’s not going to work.

This is serious business. The anti-vaxxers are wrong. They are absolutely wrong. Their information is incorrect and vaccinating people does not cause autism. Period.

Feared Collapse Of And In 2016 Cause Russian Dread

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

A highly disturbing Security Council (SCRF) report circulating in the Kremlin today is warning that the coming year, 2016, may very well see the collapse of the governments of the United States and Saudi Arabia as the citizens in both of these nations have begun revolting against the massive corruption these regimes rule by—and which should they both collapse would launch upon the entire world an “era of unprecedented instability”.

The Security Council, this report explains, is President Putin’s consultative body that works out his decisions on national security affairs and threats to the Federation and is composed of key ministers and agency heads and chaired by President Putin himself.

Though not meant to be completely “free of error”, this report states, the Security Council is, nevertheless, obligated to provide to President Putin their analysis of global affairs as they may effect the national security interests of the Federation, and which the collapse of these two nations, United States and Saudi Arabia, poses one of the greatest existential threats to Russia it has ever seen.

Of the many facts involved in fearing the collapse of the United States government, this report says, are the many warnings being issued in America today that “internal war is on the horizon” and some experts even questioning if civil war hasn’t, in fact, already begun.

Leading to these fears of internal war erupting in the , this report continues, is the complete polarization of the American people against each other driven by what a recent study stated was due to this nation having become an oligarchy after its abandoning of democracy.

With an oligarchy being a power structure in which power effectively rests with a small number of people, this report explains, the grave situation presently existing in the United States is being “ignored to their peril” by these elites—most especially current Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, who as the wife of a former President, Bill Clinton, was a former US Senator and US Secretary of State, and was the driving force in the “greatest gift to bankers” ever seen in the United States when she personally pushed through the US Congress a law forbidding, for the first time in American history, collage students to declare bankruptcy on their student loans, which has plunged millions of them into a life of debt servitude unable to contribute their earnings to their nations economy as all of their money now goes to bankers.

Following in Hillary Clinton’s footsteps in a “wholesale plundering to wealth” scheme to enrich bankers at the expense of the American people, this report continues, is President Obama—who in his first four years in office increased his worth 800% from $1.3 million to $11.8 million and once he leaves office is estimated will be able to rake in a staggering $100 million more.

With an economy of a nation being more important than even its military strength, this report warns, President Obama and the oligarchs associated with him, including the Clinton and Bush dynasties, have further destroyed America’s ability to make jobs—and which a recent Gallup article described grimly as: “Simply put, startups and shootups (small businesses that grow larger) have been in a death spiral.”

Even though Obama and Clinton regime supporter George Soros is warning these oligarchs of the grave crisis they’re creating, this report notes, nothing appears to be stopping these oligarchs from the pillaging of the American people—and has become so dangerous that a new Gallup poll showed that a staggering 75% of the American public believe corruption is “widespread” in their government, not incompetence, but corruption, and that this alarming figure has held steady since 2010, and which history has always shown no government can survive under the weight of.

As concerning to the Federation of what the collapse of the United States would do to the world, this report continues, even more so are the concerns relating to the collapse of Saudi Arabia.

With even former President Ronald Reagan top official David Stockman warning this past week that the House of Saud is “a scourge on mankind that should have been eliminated decades ago” and must be “swept into the dustbin of history”, SC experts in this report say, the collapse of this brutal oil rich monarchy may be coming sooner than later as its economy nears total collapse and its Shiite Muslim minority is now threatening to secede and “take all of its oil to Iran”.

The total collapse of Saudi Arabia is inevitable, this report states many experts are warning, as this country is ugly, depressing and unappealing like a desert slaughterhouse whose people are corrupt, indulgent, inbred, unintelligent, lazy, fat, cruel, inept and completely flaky and unreliable and have no skills nor work ethics.

And with the House of Saud belonging to the most aberrant sect of Sunni Muslims known as Wahhabism, this report further warns, it is now becoming apparent even to the West that the much more tolerant, and women rights supporting, Shiite Muslim peoples led by Iran are more in tune to what the world really is than the “barbarian” Sunni nations led by Saudi Arabia and their Gulf state sycophants Bahrain, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates—who, unlike Shiite led Iran (along with Shiite-led Syria and Lebanon), have never allowed their citizens to vote against their despotic monarchial rule.

But to the greatest fears of Saudi Arabia and it Gulf state allies, along with their Western backers, this report explains, is that even those these nations are “ruled for life” by Sunni Muslim monarchs, their oppressed Shiite citizens live on top of nearly all of the oil in the entire Middle East—and all of whom have pledged their allegiance to Iran.

And instead of coming to grips with its collapse, this report warns, the Saudi government has decided that rather than learning lessons from the hubris of its neighbours, it won’t wait for war to come home—but has readily begun exporting war in the region in its madcap bid to extend its geopolitical hegemony and prolong its petro-dominance.

Even worse, this report continues, in Saudi Arabia’s “insane bid” to push Iran into open conflict in the hopes that the Obama regime will bail them out through massive war, they not only torpedoed America’s entire Middle Eastern policy with their beheading of their most prominent, and peaceful, Shiite clerics, today they even dared to bomb the Iranian embassy in Yemen.

Though the Security Council has not assigned a “percentage likelihood” of either the United States or Saudi Arabian governments actually collapsing this year, this report concludes, they have advised President Putin that he should immediately begin preparing for it being so anyway—just in case.

528,"Most of the dinosaur skeletons you see in museums exist because of sedimentary rocks. These fossils got their start when a dinosaur died in an environment that had lots of moving sediment, like an ocean, riverbed or lake. One such place is the benthic zone -- the deepest part of a body of water. This sediment quickly buried the dinosaur, offering its body some protection it from decomposition. While the dinosaur's soft parts still eventually decomposed, its hard parts -- bones, teeth and claws -- remained.

But a buried bone isn't the same thing as a fossil -- to become a fossil, the bone has to become rock. The organic parts of the bone, like blood cells, collagen (a protein), and fat, eventually break down. But the inorganic parts of the bone, or the parts made from minerals like calcium, have more staying power. They remain after the organic materials have disappeared, creating a fragile, porous mineral in the shape of the original bone.

Other minerals reinforce this bone, burning into a fossil. Water gradually makes its way into the bone, carrying minerals like iron and calcium carbonate picked up from the surrounding sediment. As the water penetrates the dinosaur's bones, some of these minerals precipitate into their microscopic pores. As this process continues, the bone becomes more and more rocklike. It's like filling a sponge with glue -- the sponge's physical structure stays the same, and the pores and pockets within it fill up. The glue makes the sponge sturdier and more resistant to damage. Large, thick bones, which have more room for mineral glue, make better fossils than small, flat bones.

Over the course of millions of years, the sediment around these reinforced bones becomes sedimentary rock. Erosion, tides and other natural processes continue to deposit more sediment, and this sediment becomes rock, too. As long as they can withstand the pressure from the surrounding rock, the bones remain safely hidden and preserved. After millions of years, some natural process, like the gradual shifting of the planet's surface, can reveal these layers of rock and the fossils they contain.

Sedimentary rock can also hold trace fossils, which record an organism's behavior. Some of the most well-known trace fossils are trackways, or the tracks of extinct animals. These form when an animal leaves its prints in soft but sturdy soil, which creates a mold. This mold fills with sediment, and both the mold and its filling harden over millions of years. Forces like erosion remove the upper layers of rock, revealing the preserved footprints underneath.

Sediment can also fill the mold and harden into a cast, or a reproduction of the foot that made the print. This can happen with other traces, too, like burrows and tunnels. Some other trace fossils include coprolites (fossilized dung) tooth marks on bones or wood, and nests. Sediment can even preserve plant life. Plants can make impressions in hardening sediment or become petrified wood after going through much the same process as fossilized dinosaur bones do.

This type of fossilization creates sturdy fossils, but it can only take place in specific conditions. Next, we'll look at the other ways life forms can be buried, encased or otherwise protected so their remains last millions of years.",mainstream,M137d8,flat.earth
855,"U.S. Treasurys prices rose and yields eased on Thursday as an ongoing contest in Washington that has shut much of the government and left the debt ceiling problem unresolved inspired investors to buy U.S. debt, still the most viable safe haven.

Given the gridlock over the budget and healthcare reform that led to a partial government shutdown that began on Tuesday, investors are increasingly worried the lawmakers will not agree on a deal to increase the statutory $16.7 trillion borrowing limit by the Oct. 17 deadline.

Failure to increase the debt ceiling, they fear, would unleash market chaos and damage the long-term creditworthiness of the U.S. government and the safe-haven status of the dollar.

""At this point, the market seems to have a pretty high degree of confidence the Treasury will not miss or delay a principal or interest payment—that other things will give before that gives,"" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at Prudential Fixed Income, with $400 billion in assets under management, in Newark, New Jersey.

""But if that assumption comes into question you will see the orderly repricing that is going on right now become disorderly,"" he said. ""For the market, any significant doubt as to the timely payment of interest or principal on Treasury securities would be tantamount to the earth ceasing to rotate on its axis.""

As concerns over a possible U.S. default have intensified, the cost to insure Treasurys has soared in the credit default swaps market, though analysts qualify that by noting that that market is not particularly broad or deep.

Economic data took a back seat to worries about the political fighting in Washington.

The U.S. Labor Department said jobless claims totaled 308,000 in the week ended Sept. 28, compared with an upwardly revised 307,000 in the previous week. Economists had projected the latest figure to have risen to 313,000.

This was the last government economic report until the partial shutdown ends.

Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management index showed the non-manufacturing sector of the economy grew in September, but not as quickly as it did in August.

23,"From the left, Rick Berke, Helen Branswell, Juliette Kayyem and Michael Mina discuss the coronavirus outbreak at an Institute of Politics Forum at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — For a veteran epidemiologist, an authority on homeland security, and a global health reporter, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus is the type of emergency they had long anticipated. But now that it is here, the three experts said Friday, they still couldn’t help but feel the monumentality of what they were watching unfold.

“It’s the most daunting virus that we’ve contended with in half a century or more,” Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said at a panel discussion Friday at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.

Helen Branswell, STAT’s infectious diseases and public health reporter, has covered emerging pathogens since the 2003 SARS outbreak.

But with the new coronavirus, Branswell said during the panel, “It’s bizarre but I find myself startled. Having written about the possibility of something like this for years, I still find myself really startled that it’s happening, and I don’t know why that is.”

She compared the circumstances now to the summer of 2014, when Ebola was racing through West Africa and the world didn’t seem to have a plan to stop it. “Except that I never worried then about Ebola spreading in the city I lived in,” she said. “It’s different now.”

As the panel was occurring, the Cambridge-based drug company Biogen said that top executives had been at a meeting at a Boston hotel last week that was also attended by eight people who later tested positive for the coronavirus, which causes a disease that authorities have named Covid-19. The company asked many employees to work from home for the next two weeks.

In introducing the Harvard panel, Mark Gearan, director of the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, which hosted the event, directed students and others at Harvard to new travel policies the university issued on Friday, just before the panel started. They included a ban on university-related international travel and “non-essential” university-related domestic air travel, and discourage personal international travel. “We strongly discourage any non-essential meetings or events of 100 people or more,” the email to the campus read. (Institute of Politics staff members also put more than the usual space between chairs in the audience.)

Panel moderator Rick Berke, STAT’s executive editor, asked the crowd of roughly 100 people if any of them had considered not coming to the event. A few raised their hands.

“Do I think that this is a bad idea?” Mina said when asked if the panel should be held. “I think we’re hitting the time in the course of this epidemic where we might consider that this should be one of the last types of events like this.”

Here are some highlights from the event.

Why this virus is different

The spread of the new coronavirus has been compared to influenza, which also causes a respiratory illness. But, as the panelists pointed out, there are no drugs or vaccines yet for treating or preventing the virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, as there are for flu. In addition, we are exposed to different flu strains throughout our lives, which help us build immunity. No one had immunity to this new virus.

“We have an entirely susceptible population,” Mina said. “The potential for this to burn through a population very quickly is very high without extraordinary measures.”

As researchers race to study the virus, they are finding that it does not seem to be infecting great numbers of children, or at least making them very sick. (Experts around the globe are still trying to figure out just how broadly the infection has spread, given that many mild cases are likely to be missed.) But it is causing serious harm to older people and those with underlying diseases or weakened immune systems.

“This virus, on the one hand, there’s a saving grace that it doesn’t seem to be impacting our young, and that is amazing,” Mina said. “But the mortality rate among people who are getting infected above 80 years old is 15-plus%.”

How to mentally prepare for this pandemic

If you plan for the disruptions that the response to the pandemic could require, it will seem less unexpected when schools are canceled or you’re told to work from home, advised panelist Juliette Kayyem, the faculty chair of the Kennedy School’s homeland security program and a former homeland security official at the state and federal level.

“Get your head around this is practical,” she said. “It’s here, there are going to be massive disruptions to our social fabric in terms of your day to day. All of you have a part in stopping the spread of this … but we have to treat this as part of the plan. We’re at that stage now.”

Unlike with a natural disaster or terrorist attack, “we don’t have a boom moment,” she said, and the virus was more slow rolling. “When do you activate?” she said. “That’s sort of the challenge right now.”

Kayyem, who worked in the Obama administration, also made the point that the response will be a patchwork. Some schools will close, others will remain open.

The federal government’s bungled rollout of testing for SARS-CoV-2, which has limited how many people can get tested for the virus but is now being remedied, did not inspire much confidence in the U.S. response initially. But Kayyem said that as cases are detected in more places, it will largely be on local and state agencies. She described the action as “locally executed, state managed, and federally supported.”

As for how to judge whether the response is working: “The bad thing has happened, it’s coming, it’s here,” she said. “We’re in the response phase. Our measure of success is not containment anymore. Our measure of success now is, will fewer people die or get severely sick because of our efforts?”

It’s not just the government that has a role to play, she said. Universities, the media, and employers need to act responsibly. Individuals also have to get involved, whether it’s staying home if they are not feeling well or making sure they have had the flu shot. After all, if they can avoid getting the flu, that frees up space for health care providers to deal with Covid-19 cases.

Mina said the fragmented U.S. health care system leaves him worried about the cohesion of a response.

“I don’t want to sound defeatist here, but the state of our health care system, the way we have privatized everything about it for the most part, is going to seriously impact our ability,” he said, adding that, “we have no ability to create out of the blue new hospital beds. We can’t even test appropriately.”

“If we can’t figure how to run some PCR instruments because we can’t work together as a society — this is within networks, within hospitals, within the national government, everything — I really am very concerned about this in a way that far exceeds our concerns for other viruses and other pathogens, and the most vulnerable are the elderly.”

The response in China, where the virus first emerged and cases quickly exploded, included the unprecedented steps of essentially quarantining tens of millions of people in and around Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. There were concerns about people with other diseases being able to get the care they needed and the trampling of individual liberty. But from a raw epidemiological perspective, global health authorities have argued that such drastic measures gave the world more time to prepare. The interventions in China, they say, delayed the wave of cases in other places around the world.

“I think it was absolutely the right thing,” Mina said. “They truly bought the rest of the world at least a month. The U.S. wasted it, in my opinion, but many countries did not.”

Kayyem agreed about the initial U.S. response.

“When the story is written about U.S. preparedness for this, Chapter 1 will be called ‘Squandered Time.’ Not just on the medical side, but on the preparedness side,” she said. “What were we doing? And now, how do we make up for lost time? It’s not just the kits. It’s why this week we seemed so flat-footed and surprised by things like school closings. School closings were inevitable the second we had the first patients.”

Where this could go from here

Branswell noted that some people, based on both biology and socioeconomics, will be able to weather the outbreak more safely and less disruptively than others.

“I’m very worried right now about vulnerable populations,” she said.

“I’m really concerned about people living in long-term care facilities. If this virus gets into long-term care facilities [as it has in the Seattle area], it will be really bad. I’m worried about people who stay in homeless shelters. I’m worried about people who work in retail. I’m worried about people who don’t have the money to stockpile food because they don’t have extra money. I’m worried about the fact that there isn’t much social cohesion right now. People seem to be really angry at each other a lot and this is a time when we’re really going to need to help each other.”

Kayyem said that organizers of large events, including the presidential nominating conventions and the Olympics, need to start coming up with Plan Bs. The decisions about whether to actually go with these alternate plans can’t be made yet, but it is crucial to start developing contingencies.

“I cannot tell you when we’re going to activate and when it’s going to impact, but if the parties are not thinking about how you pick your nominee in a different manner, shame on them,” she said about the conventions.

“We don’t know where we will be at that moment,” she added. “I think we need to be comfortable making decisions in week allotments.”

After the event, Harvard officials said they were considering cancelling a full roster of Kennedy School Forums for next week, making Friday’s potentially their last public event at the Kennedy School for quite a while.

1167,"Yesterday, the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia aired a five and a half minute video about climate change. Directed by James Cameron and narrated by Sigourney Weaver, it featured Don Cheadle, Jack Black, America Ferrera, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, and other celebs. Instead of scientists and hockey sticks, it had forest fires, Hurricane Sandy survivors, and a summer blockbuster soundtrack. The gist: Climate change is causing awful things in America and abroad. If you care to stop it, vote for Hillary Clinton.

None of that is as remarkable as the context in which it was shown. In the decades since scientists first warned a US president that greenhouse gas emissions would doom us all, no political party has ever presented itself as taking the issue seriously during a presidential election. This year is different. And not because the Republican candidate calls climate change a hoax. What's new is Democrats are going on the offense. Speaker after speaker at the convention has laid into Donald Trump and his party's denialism. Climate action is a prominent plank in the Democratic Party platform. They've made the stakes clear: A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for planet Earth.",mainstream,M120c0,flat.earth

And with that, Irving made clear that he regrets publicly saying that the Earth is flat.

Speaking Monday at the Forbes Under 30 summit in Boston, the flat-Earth topic that Irving inserted himself into last year was discussed — and the All-Star guard said he didn’t realize the effect that his claim would have once it went public.

“To all the science teachers, everybody coming up to me like, ‘You know I’ve got to reteach my whole curriculum?’ I’m sorry,” Irving said, as the room attending his session laughed. “I apologize. I apologize.”

Irving said he’s since learned certain thoughts are best kept in “intimate conversations.”

This whole saga started in February 2017, when Irving questioned whether the Earth is flat on a podcast that came out shortly before All-Star weekend that year in New Orleans. It became a major story and even NBA Commissioner Adam Silver — who, like Irving, went to Duke — was asked to offer his opinion.

“Kyrie and I went to the same college,” Silver said then. “He may have taken some different courses.”

Irving indicated in the days and months that followed the podcast that he initially made the remarks to promote conversation and prove a point how stories in this social-media age can spread rapidly. But then he told The New York Times in early June of this year that he was not completely sure whether the Earth was flat or round.

“I do research on both sides,” Irving said at the time. “I’m not against anyone that thinks the Earth is round. I’m not against anyone that thinks it’s flat. I just love hearing the debate.”

He said Monday he’d like to have the matter put to rest, and noted that this escapade was a good lesson of how words that come from influential people can have enormous power.

“At the time, I was like huge into conspiracies,” Irving said. “And everybody’s been there.”

644,"A half billion year old hammer embedded in rock that formed 400 million years ago.

In June 1936 Max Hahn and his wife Emma were on a walk beside a waterfall near to London, Texas, when they noticed a rock with wood protruding from its core. They decided to take the oddity home and later cracked it open with a hammer and a chisel. What they found within shocked the archaeological and scientific community. Embedded in the rock was what appeared to be some type of ancient man made hammer.

A team of archaeologists analysed and dated it. The rock encasing the hammer was dated to more than 400 million years old. The hammer itself turned out to be more than 500 million years old. Additionally, a section of the wooden handle had begun the metamorphosis into coal. The hammer’s head, made of more than 96% iron, is far more pure than anything nature could have achieved without assistance from relatively modern smelting methods.

In 1889 near Nampa, Idaho, whilst workers were boring an artesian well, a small figurine made of baked clay was extracted from a depth of 320 feet. To reach this depth the workers had to cut through fifteen feet of basalt lava and many other strata below that. That in itself does not seem remarkable, until one considers that the very top layer of lava has been dated to at least 15 million years old!

It is currently accepted by science and geology that coal is a by-product of decaying vegetation. The vegetation becomes buried over time and is covered with sediment. That sediment eventually fossilises and becomes rock. This natural process of coal formation takes up to 400 million years to accomplish.

Anything that is found in lumps of coal or in coal seams during mining, had to have been placed or dropped into the vegetation before it was buried in sediment.

In 1944, as a ten year old boy, Newton Anderson, dropped a lump of coal in his basement and it broke in half as it hit the floor. What he discovered inside defies explanation based upon current scientific orthodoxy.

Inside the coal was a hand crafted brass alloy bell with an iron clapper and sculptured handle.

When an analysis was carried out it was discovered that the bell was made from anunusual mix of metals, different from any known modern alloy production (including copper, zinc, tin, arsenic, iodine, and selenium).

The seam from whence this lump of coal was mined is estimated to be 300,000,000 years old!

A hand crafted bell found in a 300 million year old lump of coal!

These extraordinary discoveries although bizarre, are not unique or even uncommon. There are literally thousands of them collecting dust, locked away from public scrutiny in the vaults of museums throughout the world.

There are many other unusual reported finds including the following:

The Morrisonville, Illinois Times, on June 11, 1891, reported how Mrs. S. W. Culp found a circular shaped eight-carat gold chain, about 10 inches long, embedded in a lump of coal after she broke it apart to put in her scuttle. The chain was described as “antique” and of “quaint workmanship.”

Displayed in a museum at Glen Rose, Texas, is a cast iron pot reportedly found in a large lump of coal in 1912 by a worker feeding coal into the furnace of a power plant. When he split open the coal the worker said the pot fell out, leaving its impression in the coal.

Yet another report found in the Epoch Times told of a Colorado rancher who in the 1800’s broke open a lump of coal, dug from a vein some 300 feet below the surface, and discovered a “strange-looking iron thimble.”

The Salzburg Cube is yet another ancient puzzle found by a worker named Reidl, in an Austrian foundry in 1885. Like the others, this man broke open a block of coal and found a metal cube embedded inside. Recent analysis established the object was of forged iron and obviously hand crafted. The coal it was found in was millions of years old.

The list of such items goes on and on and on.

Welcome to the world of Ooparts, or Out of Place Artefacts.

Out of place artefacts (Ooparts) are so named because conventional scientific wisdom (an oxymoron if ever there was one) states that these artefacts shouldn’t exist based upon currently accepted beliefs regarding our origins and history. These discoveries are “out of place” in the orthodox timeline of human history.

The usual methods of the conformist scientific community, when faced with such anomalies is to attempt to debunk their reported age, or perhaps endeavour to discredit the source of the report or even the reporter. If this approach fails then usually the artefacts themselves are banished to the shadowy vaults of museums and warehouses, never to be seen again.

If these unusual artefacts were “one offs” then perhaps one could be forgiven for accepting the view espoused by the mainstream scientific and archaeological community that they are hoaxes or misreported stories. However, when one realises that thousands upon thousands of these anomalous artefacts have been discovered and reported over the years, then one may need to re-evaluate ones acceptance of the integrity of mainstream archaeology and science.

Occasionally an honest archaeologist will attempt to reveal to the public the true age and origin of such anomalous objects. They will question the accepted beliefs of their mainstream peers. They usually find that their career ends quite abruptly.

Unfortunately, the majority just accept what they are taught in school and university without question. That is how our educational system is designed. It does not encourage individuality and originality. It purely indoctrinates one with established beliefs and dogma.

If one requires evidence of this “mainstream” mentality, one need look no further than the realms of psychiatry. Modern psychiatry seeks to demonize and declare mentally ill anyone who deviates from what is regarded as the norm.

These so called “mental health professionals” have even invented a new mental disorder named Oppositional Defiant Disorder, or ODD (love the irony of the abbreviation).

This newly invented condition is listed in the latest instalment of the industry’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, which dubs people who do not conform to what those in charge declare to be normal, as mentally insane.

So there you have your proof – I’m obviously an unmitigated nutter and completely insane. At least that is what those in authority would like everyone to believe!

On one side of the field we have the Darwinists and their theory of evolution, trying to establish the extremely flawed view that we have somehow evolved into highly intelligent sentient beings from a primordial blob of gunge, miraculously brought to life by an electrical storm billions of years ago. (Perhaps one of this cults followers could explain to me when “consciousness” evolved, and provide proof – I await with baited breath!)

On the other side we have the creationists with the belief that some omnipotent invisible being who lives in the clouds, waved his magic wand about 7,000 years ago and created the earth and everything on it. Again the adherents of this equally flawed theory rely on nothing more than a book called the Bible for their “proof” of this concept. The fact that this book has been bastardised during translation numerous times during its existence, has been re-written to certain individuals personal preference on a number of occasions, and has had many complete chapters omitted, is irrelevant to its followers. All they require is “faith”. Proof and evidence is not a prerequisite!

One couldn’t get more opposing beliefs if one tried, and both camps adhere to their beliefs voraciously, and with unshakable fervour. Yet neither are based on any kind of factual or hard evidence.

The reality is that the origin of the human race is a total enigma. No one, anywhere, actually knows how old humanity is or how and where it originated. It is a complete mystery. Yet from birth one is indoctrinated into one or the other of the above factions, with no questions asked or alternative opinions allowed.

The problem the mainstream has with these anomalous Ooparts is that they throw into question every single established belief there is regarding our past.

It seems that everywhere we look, we find things that contradict much of the scientific orthodoxy of today. The scientific establishment will never acknowledge or admit that these artefacts are authentic. To do so would be to admit that they are completely wrong about our origins, and consequently, invalidate all of the text books used to indoctrinate us and our children.

The discovery of Ooparts completely annihilates the [comparatively recent] theory of evolution. If, as this hypothesis would have us believe, modern humans only evolved 200,000 years ago (or thereabouts), one has to ask how man made artefacts, found in substrata originating millions of years ago, could be explained?

Alternatively, the advocates of creationism have a very quaint way of “acknowledging” the existence of Ooparts, and bizarrely, actually believe that Ooparts substantiate their world view.

Creationists just completely disregard the established dating methods, and declare every single recognized archaeological and geological process null and void. They would have us all believe that coal seams, rock strata, fossils, minerals, precious stones and every other antediluvian element, took only a few thousand years to form.

Yet the psychiatric establishment would have me labelled as the loony for questioning this baloney. Go figure!

There will no doubt be readers who, similar to predictable conservative archaeologists, and probably due to their indoctrinated belief system, will also dismiss the aforementioned Ooparts as hoaxes or forgeries. Perhaps they would like to consider and offer an explanation for the following.

It is an accepted belief that humans and dinosaurs did not co-exist. According to conventional academia, dinosaurs roamed the earth between 65 and 225 million years ago, whereas the earliest upright biped humanoid, homo erectus, only appeared about 1.8 million years ago.

However, in 1968 a palaeontologist named Stan Taylor began excavations of fossilised dinosaur footprints, discovered in the bed of the Paluxy river near Glen Rose, Texas. What he unearthed shocked and dumbfounded the scientific community. Alongside the dinosaur tracks, in exactly the same cretaceous fossilised strata, were well preserved human footprints.

The immediate reaction of evolutionists, archaeologists, and science in general, was to debunk the find as a hoax. “They were carved into the rock by hoaxers” or “They are not human footprints, but more dinosaur footprints that have been eroded to look human” were the arguments most commonly proposed.

However, their line of reasoning falls somewhat flat when one asks why only the human prints were eroded and not also the 3 toed dinosaur prints? Additionally one has to consider, if the human prints were carved as a hoax, how did the hoaxers manage to carve further human footprints that continued under bedrock that was later removed from the side of the river bed?

Since the initial discovery, hundreds more human footprints have been discovered and unearthed, both in Paluxy and in many other places around the globe. Either those hoaxers have unlimited time and budget – or someone is telling porkies!

Next one needs to consider another find discovered in 100 million year old cretaceous limestone. A fossilised human finger, which was found along with a childs tooth and human hair. This finger has been subjected to numerous scientific tests and analysis. Sectioning revealed the typical porous bone structure expected in a human finger. Additionally a Cat-scan and MRI scan identified joints and traced tendons throughout the length of the fossil. This is one find that science cannot explain away as a hoax.

at-scan of a human fossilised finger shows dark areas showing the interior of bones and bone marrow, along with tendons.

There is however another find of recent years that blows all of the others into a cocked hat regarding age.

Over the past few decades, miners near the little town of Ottosdal in Western Transvaal, South Africa, have been digging up hundreds of mysterious metal spheres. These spheres measure between 25 and 100 mm in diameter, and some are etched with three parallel grooves running completely around the equator. Two types of spheres have been found. One is composed of a solid bluish metal with flecks of white, the other is hollowed out and filled with a spongy white substance.

These spheres are reportedly so delicately balanced that even with modern technology, they would need to be made in a zero gravity environment to attain these characteristics. These objects have become known as the Klerksdorp spheres.

Geologists have attempted to debunk these artefacts as natural formations or “limonite concretions”. They fail to explain sufficiently how these formations occurred naturally with perfectly straight and perfectly spaced grooves around the centres.

Perhaps the real reason for such fervent attempted debunking by the scientific community, is that the rock in which these spheres where found is Precambrian – and dated to 2.8 billion years old!

Whether one wishes to accept these out of place artefacts as genuine or not is I suppose, down to personal beliefs.

Evolutionists refuse to accept them as to do so would mean re-evaluating their whole indoctrinated belief system. They will even stoop to producing outright fantasy in their attempts to discredit these discoveries. If that fails then they will just pretend that they do not exist, and then hide them away – forever.

Creationists on the other hand willingly accept them as some bizarre kind of proof that the universe is only about 7,000 years old, and totally ignore any evidence, from any source, to the contrary. They continue to cling to a medieval belief system based purely on blind faith. How quaint.

Personally, I don’t belong to either camp. I keep an open mind regarding our origins. I don’t have any particular “philosophy” on the subject but rather prefer to adapt my understanding as new evidence becomes available. My only current belief based upon all of the available facts to date is that the human race has inhabited this planet for millions of years longer than is presently accepted.

I realise that I will never discover the answer to the question of our origin. The human race has been searching for this answer since the dawn of time, and it still evades us.

Everything we have been taught in our schools and universities about our origin and history, is based upon nothing more than speculation and hypothesis. There is not a single provable fact out there that conclusively answers the question “where do we come from”

What I will continue to do however is question everything, and not just blindly accept any mainstream viewpoint because it happens to be fashionable at the time.

If that means one day I get a knock at my door from men in white coats holding a straight jacket, then so be it……",conspiracy,C040f1,flat.earth
526,"NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal legitimately believes the Earth is flat given his recent comments on the The Big Podcast With Shaq. As funny and unbelievable as this is, he's not the only NBA star that has made recent comments about the Earth being flat, which appears to be a growing sentiment in the NBA.

During the podcast, Shaquille O’Neal claimed the Earth is flat because he's driven many times from coast to coast and it seems flat to him while driving. The full extent of his nonsensical reasoning is below, which was promoted in response to Kyrie Irving insisting he believes the Earth is flat.

“It’s true. The Earth is flat. The Earth is flat. Yes, it is. Listen, there are three ways to manipulate the mind — what you read, what you see and what you hear. In school, first thing they teach us is, ‘Oh, Columbus discovered America,’ but when he got there, there were some fair-skinned people with the long hair smoking on the peace pipes. So, what does that tell you? Columbus didn’t discover America. So, listen, I drive from coast to coast, and this s*** is flat to me. I’m just saying. I drive from Florida to California all the time, and it’s flat to me. I do not go up and down at a 360-degree angle, and all that stuff about gravity, have you looked outside Atlanta lately and seen all these buildings? You mean to tell me that China is under us? China is under us? It’s not. The world is flat.”

Hopefully Shaq is joking and doesn't honestly believe the Earth is flat. However, when one of his co-hosts injected some reason that we have satellite imagery from space that shows the Earth is round Shaq responded with ""Oh satellite imagery? That could be [a] drone or made up."" He followed it up insisting that it's flat “I’m just saying that when I drive from Florida to New York – flat. New York to Seattle – flat. Seattle to LA – flat.”

These comments are on the back of several high-profile NBA players insisting the Earth is flat from their views. Kyrie Irving, a Cleveland Cavaliers' player, stated that he believes the Earth is flat, adding that “I’ve seen a lot of things that my educational system has said that was real that turned out to be completely fake."" The flat Earth claim by Kyrie was further backed by Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors and Wilson Chandler of the Denver Nuggets who claimed NASA's photos of Earth from space could have been easily be altered using a smartphone.

It is entirely possible that some or all of the aforementioned NBA stars do not actually believe the Earth is flat and are simply joking. Ultimately, it doesn't entirely matter whether they are serious or joking because the perception and reaction has been the same. The harm is when role models openly oppose basic fundamentals of science without any data backing it. Hopefully those that look up to these players realize that a belief in science underpins every piece of their daily life from transportation to medical advances and smartphones.

Shaq has built up quite a resume, 15 time NBA All-star, 7th place in all-time points scored, 3 time NBA All Star Game MVP, and has even earned a doctorate. We can only hope that Shaq's mistrust of experts and centuries of research doesn't lead to a generalized mistrust of science as a whole.

231,"The national protests seeking an end to systemic discrimination against black Americans have given new fuel to a racial reckoning in economics, a discipline dominated by white men despite decades of efforts to open greater opportunity for women and nonwhite men.

A growing chorus of economists is seeking to dislodge the editor of a top academic publication, the University of Chicago economist Harald Uhlig, after he criticized the Black Lives Matter organization on Twitter and equated its members with “flat earthers” over their embrace of calls to defund police departments.

Days earlier, the profession’s de facto governing body, the American Economic Association, sent a letter to its members supporting protesters and saying that “we have only begun to understand racism and its impact on our profession and our discipline.” A group of economists, mostly from outside academia, last week hosted an online fund-raising effort for the Sadie Collective, an organization that aims to bring more black women into the field.

Black economists say the events have brought some progress to a field that has long struggled with discrimination in its ranks — and with a refusal by many of its leaders to acknowledge discrimination in the country at large. But the profession remains nowhere close to a full-scale shift on racial issues: On Wednesday, the director of the White House National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, told reporters, “I don’t believe there is systemic racism in the U.S.”",mainstream,M0b5a9,flat.earth

1027,"ONE day during the past summer, at the end of a long uphill beat after the partridges, I threw myself breathless on the ground, and on my back waited for the others to come up. As they drew near, five or six strong, tramping heavily through the turnips, I was struck by the apparent tremor of the earth beneath me. It was shivering like a jelly—or I was; for a moment I was in doubt which. Spreading out my hands upon the surface and lying as dose and flat as I could, l was soon made sure that the tremor was really in the earth and not in me. It grew more and more distinct, keeping time with the tramp of the walkers. When at last they reached me I told them of their Neptunian feat, and, them jump altogether a few yards off, was gratified to find that I could thus bring about a. very respectable earthquake at will. The motion was very peculiar, and I can well believe that a queasier stomach than mine would soon be conscious of something very like a ^l de terre. We examined the structure of this skipping hill, hut found nothing that helped us much to an explanation. It was mainly made up of a thick cap of gravel on a base of red sandstone, and so was not likely to contain anything like a high-arched hollow or concealed morass within. This vivid little experience made me readier, perhaps, than some to accept the striking statements about earth shaking made by the brothers Darwin at the York meeting of the British Association. Especially was I prepared to give credit to what they quoted from the Astronomer Royal about Greenwich Hill and the Observatory. He wrote: ” In the old times of Greenwich Fair, some twenty years ago, when crowds of people used to run down the hill, I find the observers could not take reflection observations for two or three hours after the crowd had been turned out. . . . We do not have anything like such crowds now, even on bank holidays, and 1 have not heard lateiy of any interference with tile observations.”' ' There is as little foundation for the calumnious hypothesis that the observers whose reflections were thus agitated had been visiting the fair themselves as for the suggestion that the above experience of my own took place after luncheon. No. the truth is the solid earth is a very elastic solid after all, and Greenwich HiU and the Observatory and all that it contained were trembling like my Highland knoll. The hOWdah of the Atlas elephant that stands on a tortoise, is a rather rickety structure, and quakes with every jog of the Titanic beast. But is it not being tugged at by every petty planetoid, pulled from its path by every planet, heaved all awry through its yielding bulk by sun and moon in their courses? It is; but over and above these longer, graver motions there are incessant tremblings and quiverings in quick periods, measured by seconds or less. This unlooked for sensitiveness to small stresses, this incessant vibration when all obvious disturbing causes are eliminated, are the new facts that the Darwins have so strikingly brought out. How solid rock and massive piers of stone warp under heat and cold like unseasoned wood; how a wide stretch of ground may swey and rise for hours together after a little water has been poured on it; how the passage of a train miles away or the pressing of a finger on the ground near at hand may be enough to deflect the plumb line to a visible degree—these and many other new phenomena are detailed in the full and most interesting preliminary report on the Lunar Disturbance of Gravity, handed in to the Section of Physics by the ingenious brothers. The title reminds us that, as so often in science. it was in looking for one thing that they found another. Every one knows that as the earth pulls the moon round in its monthly orbit, so, too, the moon. pulls the earth and everything upon it. If a plummet be hung up right under the moon, so to speak, the earth is drawing the bob downward, the moon very much more feebly pulls it upward. The result is that the bob weighs a trifle lighter than if the moon were abolished. Thanks to the moon, the string is leM severely strained. If the moon be not right overhead, but down a little toward its rising or its setting point, the bob will be a little drawn aside out of the straight and the plummet will no longer give a true plumb line. As the moon rises, crosses the sky, and sets, then the direction of the plumb line will change through a small angle. Of course, even when no moon is seen, its silent influence must be felt, and the plumb line will return to its position by the time the moon is ready to rise again. How small the change really is we may gather from the fact that with a plummet three hundred yards long, the travel to and fro of the bob could scarcely II this country reach a thousandth of an inch. This is what is meant by the lunar disturbance of the direction of gravity: and there must, of course, be a solar disturbance also, the same in kind, but naturally very much smaller in amount. To investigate these disturbances experimentally clearly calls for refined skill and very delicate apparatus; but Sir William Thomson, to whom instrumental difficulties are always but child's play, in suggesting the investigation three years ago, had in view the detection of an influence still more recondite and refined. I have said that the moon, in pulling aside the bob of the plummet, pulls also on the earth beneath it. If the earth were perfectly stiff and unyielding, this pull could have no effect on the deflection of the plumb line. But if, as we have reason to believe, the earth yields like a great viscous mass to great stresses as well as to small ones, a hump of solid earth—a land tide—will travel round the globe in obedience to the moon's attraction. This hump in its course will pass under the suspended plummet, and the actual deflections of the plumb line as observed will no longer agree with those reckoned on the supposition that the earth is rigid. If we had an instrument, then, by which the minute aberrations of a carefully suspended pendulum, isolated as far as possible from all local disturbance, could be magnified up to the point of visibility, we should have it in our power
• “ On an Instrument for Detecting and'Measuring flmall Changes in the Direction of Gravity.” By George H. Darwin. M.A., F.B S., late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Horace Darwin, M.A., A.M.I.l:.lS. British Association Report. 1881.to settle some very pretty points in the physical theory of the world. Such an instrument, after various trials andfail- ures. the Darwins have erected in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge. A massive stoue, weighing three-quarters of a ton, is bedded in a pit upon the native gravel. It is surrounded by a trench, a foot wide, to isolate it completely from the floor and the building. The pendulum is a massive cylinder of pure copper, hung by a brass wire about a yard long. inside a hoRow cylindrical copper support that rises from the stone. A tiny galvanometer mirror is hung by two fine threads, one of which is fastened to the bob and the other to a projection of the fixed support. This suspension is so arranged that any movement of the hob displaces the mirror to a much greater degree. A ray of light is sent from a distant lamp on to the mirror, and thence reflected to a scale seven feet away. The magnification resulting from this double process is something like 50,010 times. To still and quench accidental tremors, the hollow copper cylinder is filled up with a mixture of spirits and water. It is a fact, ^^e out hy Poiseuille, that a boiled mixture of ginand water is much more viscous and clogs the motions of bodies immersed in it much more effectually than either the neat gin or the simple water. Further to ward off the effect' of external changes of temperature, the whole instrument is immersed in a tank of water resting on the stone; and lastly, after the precedent of the Tisbbite, tile surrounding trencb is also filled up with water. Thus protected, tbe apparatus might seem sufficiently cut off from local influences, but as a fact its sensitiveness is now so great that tbe observation has to he carried on in another room by means of a window and a telescope. Standing in the room itself sixteen feet away, it is enough to shih youi' weight from one foot to the other to cause the speck of ligbt to run along the scale. The same result follows if you pre^ steadily with your fingers on the stone edge of the trench, but you may strike a good sharp blow even on the stone base without effect. It is the distor- sion of the soil by slight steady pressure that is transmitted through solid gravel aud stone and shows itself as a microscopic deviation of the pendulum. Such being the case, the instrument should he deiicate enough, in all conscience, to determine lunar and even solar disturbances in the direction of gravity ; but, unfortunately, having got so far, we seem almost to have done too much. When regular series of observations are made it is found that the pendulum is hardly ever steady. The image on the seale dances about inceiMantly. The ground is never really still. Some days it may bequieter than others, and generally there is evidence of distinct diurnal periods, but the minor zigzags constantly interrupt and at times reverse for an hour together the slower march northward or southward. These tremors have been hitherto so persistent and so wildly irregular that for the present, at least, the prospect of unraveling from them the perturbations due to the moon does not seem very near. Mr. George Darwin talks of the probable necessity of building a gravitation observatory at the bottom of a mine. There, it may be hoped, the rail way train and the market cart will cease from troubling, and the plummet, save for Ihe steady paces of the moon, will be at rest. The work of examining and observing these tremors of the surface is, however, still going on at Cambridge, and idrcady several sharp seasons of microscopic earthquake, unsuspected outside, have been noted. Sometimes a very storm of tremor breaks out for which no sufficient local cause can be traced-. Even so far, the outcome of these experiments may prove of high value to practical astronomers. The piers on which their great telescopes turn are built of solid stone, hitherto regarded as the material most insusceptible to change or disturbance. The Darwins have shown that such piers are really most sensitive to inequalities of temperature and to small stresses. They yield and warp to a most unexpected degree. Tbeir had conducting power is responsible for this in part, and it is fruitfully suggested that it might be well to plate the piers with coppenand to swathe them wi*h flannel. Astronomers, who, to their vexation. have to redetermine the level of their instruments from hour to hour, and who have long suspected the occurrence of microscopic earthquakes, will take note of this practical hint.. They will make ready use, too, of the observation here recorded as to the effect of the observer's own weigbt. They will think more of the drainage of the soil around their instruments after the observation on the irregular and long-continued swelling of ' the ground that results from the percolation of water. Meanwhile the British Association and Cambridge may be congratulated (in the new and valuable, field of work thus opened out under their au.;pices, and especially on their having enlisted the services and energies of two workers who so worthily keep up the tradition of an honored name. —London Times.",mainstream,M15b3e,flat.earth
1108,"Deep State Rising: The Mainstreaming of the Shadow Government

It goes by many names: The shadow government. The deep state. The secret team. Whatever it is called, the idea is simple: there is an unelected, unaccountable, largely unknown group behind the facade of the visible government that wields power and works toward long-term agenda goals no matter which political party or puppet politician holds office.

Long the domain of the dreaded “conspiracy theorist” community, the idea has surfaced here and there over the years. The JFK assassination has given rise to many inside accounts and outside exposés of The Secret Team. The Iran-Contra scandal led to a Bill Moyers documentary on The Secret Government that is still worth watching 19 years later. It was even openly acknowledged that a “shadow government” had kicked into operation on 9/11.

But an odd phenomenon has taken place in recent years and intensified in recent months: the idea of a “deep state” or a “shadow government” controlling politics, even in the US, is becoming mainstream.

It has graced the cover of any number of recent books, including “Deep State: Inside the Government Secrecy Industry” and “The Deep State: The Fall of the Constitution and the Rise of a Shadow Government.”

It has found its way into the online political media from both the left (Salon) and the right (The American Conservative) ends of the controlled political spectrum.

It has been invoked by mainstream financial analysts to describe the actions of the Federal Reserve.

It has been revisited by Bill Moyers on his website.

It has found its way into the headlines of The Boston Globe (“Vote all you want. The secret government won’t change“) and the New York Times (“America’s ‘Establishment’ Has Embraced ‘Deep States’“).

Heck, it has even been talked about on the World Bank’s blog.

This onslaught of attention begs the question: why now? Why are so many mainstream outlets suddenly shining a light on something that has barely been acknowledged in the past?

To be sure, some of this recent coverage is a whitewash, as you would expect. The World Bank blog, for instance, pawns the concept off as something to be found in “newish democracies” in “Latin America, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and so on,” i.e., not in the West. This qualification–that the “deep state” idea is something only to be found in foreign, backwards polities–harkens back to the origins of the phrase. The term “deep state” itself is a translation of a Turkish phrase, derin devlet, that rose to prominence after the Susurluk incident exposed the Turkish secret government and its NATO/Gladio/drug running/terrorist associations. It has become increasingly allowable for opinion makers in the MSM to cite the Turkish or the Egyptian “deep state” as a real phenomenon (or at least a real possibility) while simultaneously deriding the possibility that it exists in the West.

However in recent years researchers like Peter Dale Scott have developed and expanded the concept to explain how Western political institutions function. This seems to have been picked up by people like Mike Lofgren, a retired Congressional staffer who has described how the American deep state involves a cross-party consensus on key political issues, or Philip Giraldi, the former intelligence agent whose recent musings on the American deep state received copious attention from the mainstream press.

One way to look at this development is as an extension of a phenomenon that I noted several years ago: a process of indoctrination that has begun to inform the public that there is a shadowy elite in control of the world stage and prepare them to accept that fact. Nearly a decade ago Kissinger mini-me David Rothkopf came out with his book “Superclass” revealing the group of 6,000 or so non-state actors with the ability to enact policies and further agendas across state lines. Since that time a remarkable number of conspiracies-that-dare-not-be-mentioned from the CFR to the Bilderberg Group to the Bohemian Grove are now banal political talking points. Whereas mainstream radio hosts once played Twilight Zone music when callers tried to discuss the CFR, now Hillary Clinton blithely admits that the State Department receives marching orders from them; whereas the Bilderberg Group was once subject to a complete media blackout, it now has its own website and press releases.

But again: why now?

Partly this has to be due to the fact that in the post-9/11, post-Iraq, post-bailout, post-Hope and Change world, it has become impossible to maintain the illusion that it is the political front men who are running the show. No one believes this lie anymore, and it shows.

Even scientific studies are now demonstrating that the United States is not run by political parties but by pockets of special interest.

Truly the conspiracy toothpaste is out of the tube and there’s no point in trying to put it back. While in many ways this represents the crowning achievement of the tireless efforts of generations of conspiracy researchers who have toiled in relative obscurity, it is not an unmitigated good. As we will see in the 2016 prospective this weekend, the revelation of the ruling elite coincides with a meltdown of social cohesion that is giving rise to dark forces that portend a very tumultuous year.

In the meantime, I’m interested in your thoughts on this subject. Why do you think the “deep state” idea is being taken up in the mainstream now? Do you think there is a strategy to these revelations or is it a rearguard effort to whitewash the undeniable? Corbett Report members are invited to leave your comments below.",conspiracy,C0449c,flat.earth

Not having the required federal permits plus mechanical problems with his ""motorhome/rocket launcher"" forced self-taught rocket scientist ""Mad"" Mike Hughes to put his experiment on hold.

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) ""told me they would not allow me to do the event ... at least not at that location,"" Hughes said in a YouTube announcement, amid international attention over his plans to launch into the 'atmosflat.'

""It's been very disappointing,"" he said.

Hughes is a 61-year-old limo driver who has spent the last few years building a steam-powered rocket out of salvage parts in his garage. His project has cost him $20,000, which includes Rust-Oleum paint to fancy it up and a motor home he bought on Craigslist that he converted into a ramp.

Hughes was set to launch his rocket between 2 and 3 p.m.on Saturday.

Plans had been in the works for more than a year and Hughes said he was initially told by BLM ""that it was up to the (Federal Aviation Administration)"" to approve the launch. The FAA, Hughes said, told him ""We can't honestly approve it, we just know that you are going to do it there.""

News of his plans began to spread Monday and gained worldwide attention, which Hughes believes is why BLM began to push for permits.

""My feeling is that one of the top executives at the Bureau of Land Management called Needles, California, saying ... 'What's going on? Who permitted this?'"" Hughes said.

Plus, as he and his team were preparing to leave Wednesday, the motorhome/rocket launcher broke down in his driveway, he said.

""We want everyone to please stay tuned,"" Hughes said, adding he has set up a YouTube page where he will post updates. His plan is to try again next week.

1314,"The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.

Ancient and quaint seem the days of witch crazes, demon scares and tulip manias. Instances of mass hysteria may strike you as rare events in modern advanced societies. But such outbreaks are products of their times. They’re still around today, just in different guises.

Aided and abetted by its status as an internet meme, the myth of an evil, supernatural Slenderman has been panicking adolescents since 2009, even culminating in an attempted murder by proxy. If it’s easy to brush this off as a case of impressionable teens with too much internet access, then what of otherwise rational late 20th-century American adults participating in suicide cults, Puerto Rico’s mythical cattle-killing Chupacabra monster, the “irrational exuberance” of the dot-com bubble in the 1990s, or the seemingly insane rush to make bad real estate investments in the latter 2000s?

As this article is being written, the U.S. is embroiled in a diplomatic dustup with Cuba that has all the classic symptoms of a collective delusion. The U.S. State Department claims its diplomats in Havana were subjected to “sonic attacks” that produced a range of physical symptoms including hearing loss, headaches and dizziness. Consequently, the State Department pulled out most of its embassy staff and sent packing most Cuban diplomats stationed in the U.S. Although post-hoc medical exams have identified unusual physical conditions in some diplomats, there is still no direct evidence tying them to the alleged sonic attacks. Moreover, the political timing, logistical demands and absence of a plausible technology put the likelihood of the attacks at virtually zero.

So how do otherwise logical and informed 21st-century people fall under the spell of these mass delusions? Over the past several decades, psychologists and sociologists have used examples like these to dig into when and how this kind of false belief gains traction.

Collective delusions are the culprits behind mass hysterias and related phenomena. As traditionally defined, they’re characterized by a rapid, spontaneous and temporary spread of false beliefs within a circumscribed population.

Nowadays that circumscribed population can be a virtual one, bounded only by cyberconnections to a shared source of misinformation. The recent upsurge in vocal flat-Earth proponents, for example, is not the result of geographical neighbors whipping each other into a near frenzy. Social media makes it easy to find like-minded others, serve distorted information to the curious, and stir up excitement about events such as the 2017 eclipse, celebrity endorsements, and a proposed rocket launch by a flat-Earth proponent intended to prove once and for all that we are all living on a disc.

Collective delusions emerge under a combination of several conditions. Each of these precursors is straightforward enough, but it’s harder to foresee when they might occur in concert. In turn, this makes predicting delusional outbreaks a very inexact science.

The most obvious precursor is the presence of multiple people who are sufficiently connected so as to share information or experiences.

Second, just as an isolated individual may develop some beliefs and behaviors that depart from prevailing norms, collective delusions and responses are more likely to occur in relatively insular groups or networks.

Third, a collective delusion is more likely to take hold if the group is undergoing some kind of distress. This could be rising unemployment, political destabilization or an enemy’s threats of warfare. On a smaller scale, a town may lose a crucial employer, or a fire-and-brimstone minister can instigate a satanic panic with rumors of baby-killing cults.

And fourth, the stressors are potent enough to trigger, in at least some individuals, either a psychosomatic response or scapegoating behavior. Psychosomatic reactions—physical symptoms with psychological causes—may be as mild as itching or as severe as blindness. Scapegoating involves blaming a group of innocent (or possibly nonexistent) others for causing problems—psychosomatic or otherwise.

When conditions are ripe, this catalyzing subset of group members sets off a chain reaction. They begin to seek and identify external causes for their distress, or sources for its relief. Psychosomatic responses spread; contempt for the scapegoats grows. People become hypervigilant and toss critical thinking out the window, looking for and finding imagined threats. Conspiracy theories are spawned, angels and demons invoked, fears stoked, panic induced. The supernatural may start to seem natural.

As more and more group members become ensnared in a positive feedback loop, the perceived threat is legitimized, only broadening and deepening social distress further. Because they are inherently newsworthy, mass delusions are picked up by mass media which fan the flames even more.

In these ways, a nonexistent threat can set off a self-sustaining cascade of irrationality that lasts until the perceived threat recedes.

Delusion everywhere, to different degrees?

While descriptions of mass hysterias make great reading, they represent only the far end of a continuum of what sociologists like me call social diffusion processes. For the most part, these are quite mundane—you might recognize a few from your own daily life. While around the world stock market bubbles and bank runs make news, less frenetic responses to perceived threats and conspiracies abound: the 9/11 “truthers,” the recent uptick in flat-Earth beliefs, fears of gluten and genetically modified foods, climate change deniers, wars on science on some liberal college campuses, and more. Even the desire to be fashionable can be seen as a response to the fear of being excluded.

Simple mathematical equations can quite elegantly describe the speed, duration and extensiveness of the spread of beliefs and behaviors. A typical “diffusion model” shows how the penetration through a population of such things as beliefs, behaviors, illnesses, innovations or products is determined by just a few parameters. These typically include the group’s size, the density of its members’ interconnections and the inherent contagiousness of the thing being spread.

Irrational beliefs, and the often ill-considered responses they engender, can spread like an infection across groups as large as nations or as small as nuclear families. Sunshine, as they say, is the best disinfectant. Social impact theory would suggest that the best approach to administering social disinfectant is via large numbers of geographically nearby, authoritative nonbelievers.

In the case of the supposed sonic attacks in Cuba, one approach to stemming the scare would be a rapidly deployed on-site investigation by acoustic experts, neurologists, psychiatrists and military strategists. A folklorist as well wouldn’t hurt. Short of such a full-frontal counterattack, disseminating easy-to-digest skeptical information as early as possible in the process would help to slow the diffusion process and quell the mass delusion.

It’s easy enough to be caught up in a mass delusion. Fads and fashions are great examples, though their most harmful consequence may be our embarrassment when we look back on some of our previous style choices. As long as people are stressed and living in groups, most of our mass delusions will remain invisible to us until they have already run their course.

467,"Taking into account the many factors that affect eyesight, as well as other considerations, the human eye can actually see pretty far.
• Based on the curve of the Earth: Standing on a flat surface with your eyes about 5 feet off the ground, the farthest edge that you can see is about 3 miles away.
• Detecting a candle flame: Researchers believe that without obstructions, a person with healthy but average vision could see a candle flame from as far as 1.6 miles.
• Without the Earth’s curve and from higher up: You might be able to identify objects from dozens, even hundreds, of miles away. When standing on the ground, what’s going on to affect how far people can see? It’s things like:
• your eyesight, including the health and function of the eye itself
• the size of the object that you’re viewing
• the curvature of the Earth
• any obstructions in your line of sight Let’s take a look at these influences to understand how the human eye can see as far as it does.

The phrase “visual acuity” refers to the clarity of your vision. Experts consider normal, or healthy, visual acuity to be 20/20 vision. That simply means that you can clearly see something 20 feet away that you should be able to see from that distance. If you have 20/100 vision, you would still be able to see an object clearly from 20 feet away, but someone with normal vision would see it clearly from 100 feet. Conversely, if you have 20/12 vision, you can see something clearly at 20 feet that most people need to be 12 feet from to see clearly. How does the eye process images? When you look at anything, a rapid and complex sequence of actions will take place in the eye and brain:
• Light reflects off an object and passes through the cornea, which is the transparent outer layer of the eye.
• The cornea bends the light rays to allow them to enter the pupil, or the dark center of the eye.
• At the same time, the muscles in the iris — the colored area around the pupil — control the size of the pupil, making it smaller in bright light and larger in a darker setting.
• Light rays then pass through the lens, which sharpens them as they reach the retina, the thin tissue layer at the back of the eye that contains tiny nerve cells known as rods and cones.
• The rods and cones convert the light rays into electrical impulses, and these travel from the eye through the optic nerve to the brain, which converts them into images. Assuming that all of the body parts and processes that are necessary for clear vision are working normally, then the limitations on how far you can see come down to:
• the size of the object that you’re viewing

People often use the term “sightline” in a theater to describe the line of sight from an audience member’s seat to the stage. But, a sightline is really any uninterrupted visual angle from a person’s eyes to what the person is trying to see. Aside from obvious visual obstructions like trees, buildings, and clouds, there’s one major factor that can reduce your sightline: the curvature of the Earth. The Earth curves about 8 inches per mile. As a result, on a flat surface with your eyes 5 feet or so off the ground, the farthest edge that you can see is about 3 miles away. To put it another way, if you’re standing on a beach in Florida or driving past the farms of Nebraska (both places where it’s relatively flat), the farthest part of the horizon that you can see is about 3 miles away. If you were lying down on the beach with your head less than a foot off the ground, your eyes would be able to see about a mile out over the water. However, if your vantage point were much higher off the ground, then the horizon line could be a lot farther away. The curvature of the Earth wouldn’t start to cut things off from your view quite so soon. Let’s say your drive through Nebraska took you to Scotts Bluff National Monument, and you climbed to the summit at 4,659 feet. From here, you could see Laramie Peak, which is about 100 miles away in Wyoming, according to the National Park Service. That’s on a clear day. It’s not limitless, but it’s pretty far.

Consider the constellation Lyra and its brightest star Vega, which is about 25 light years from Earth. Without a telescope or any other visual aid, Vega looks like a little candle flame in the night sky. That got scientists wondering: How far away could you be from an actual candle flame on Earth and still see it the way you see Vega? Scientists measure the brightness of stars by magnitude. A pair of researchers from Texas A&M University did some experiments and concluded that a candle flame from about 1,286 feet away would have a brightness similar to that of Vega. To take their research a little further — and farther — the scientists experimented to determine the maximum distance you could be from a candle flame to see it at all. The researchers decided that someone with healthy vision could detect a candle flame from about 1.6 miles away, assuming that there was no fog or other obstructions.

The moon is about 238,900 miles away, and it’s easy to see some of its craters, valleys, and plains on a cloudless night. Even closer to home, the view from Mount Everest in the Himalayas — the world’s tallest summit at about 29,000 feet above sea level — offers a view of close to 211 miles in every direction, according to a user-generated map. Due to the elevation though, clouds often obscure the view. The 124th floor of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is the world’s tallest building at more than 2,700 feet, offers a view of about 50 miles on a clear day, Reuters reports. The nearly literal skyscraper can also provide visitors with two sunsets a day, according to an article in the The Daily Mail. If you time your elevator ride to the top just right, you can see the sun setting over the horizon. You can then catch the sun again a little later, as the curvature of the Earth and the amazing building height conspire to keep you looking to the west.",mainstream,M11fe7,flat.earth
900,"The idyllic beaches on the island of Buoj where Marshall Islands President Christopher Loeak fished as a boy are already submerged, and the ever-encroaching ocean now threatens to wash away roads, schools and airstrips.

""The end of the island gets shorter every year. Some places we used to stand on the beach to fish are now in the water,"" Mr Loeak, 60, told AFP.

Buoj is one of 52 islands in Ailinglaplap, an atoll that a Marshall Islands survey found was one of its most vulnerable to climate change.

""I have great attraction to Ailinglaplap,"" Mr Loeak said in the capital, Majuro. ""I can live on other islands, but I was born and raised there. I always think about going back there to live.""

The Marshalls, an island nation of some 70,000 people about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, will have a rare moment in the international spotlight in September, when it hosts the annual Pacific Islands Forum.

Loeak said he wanted to use the opportunity to send a strong message to the world, particularly larger polluting nations, about the need for action to slow down climate change.

""We will not stop telling people that climate change is a real issue for humanity,"" he said. ""We will be the first to feel it, but it will come to them and they should realise it.""

The warning was echoed by Barack Obama in a landmark speech, in which the US president dismissed climate change deniers and outlined steps aimed at making Washington a global leader in greenhouse gas reduction.

""We don't have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society,"" Mr Obama said.

""Sticking your head in the sand might make you feel safer, but it is not going to protect you from the coming storm.""

The impact of global warming is starkly evident in Ailinglaplap, with the Marshall Islands' senior climate change advisor Steve Why saying the majority of the atoll's shorelines were eroding.

""Infrastructure at risk of eroding includes three airstrips, roads, causeways and schools,"" he said.

Why and his survey team documented coastal erosion as an increasingly serious problem affecting many of the atoll's islands and noted the threat of rising sea levels to the entire country.

""Strong northeast trade winds since October 2012 have elevated sea levels three-to-six inches (7.6-15.2 centimetres), noticeably accelerating erosion on Ailinglaplap,"" he said.

About 1,700 people are scattered on the atoll's islands, which are barely a metre (three-feet) above sea level, even at their highest points.

A causeway linking some of the islands is disappearing, while salt water makes previously productive agricultural land useless.

Why said discussions with the community showed people wanted the infrastructure problems fixed, but they were reluctant to confront the worst-case scenario.

""Most conversations stalled as we envisaged what the future held - over a three foot rise in average sea level during this century, and more beyond that,"" he said.

""(It's) not difficult to imagine what will happen over the coming decades while standing, talking, sleeping and raising one's family on land that is just a couple of feet in elevation above the high tide mark - a line that is now always slowly moving inland - when there isn't anywhere else that's easy to retreat to.""

Mr Loeak said the fate of the low-lying nation raised questions about the basic human rights of those affected by global warming, warning that if the islands were ultimately engulfed by the ocean, ""we become refugees"".

Mr Loeak said that while he was happy to see world leaders such as Obama talking about climate change, it had not changed the fact that sea levels were continuing to rise in the Pacific.

And he said in the face of rising waters, his own fate was tied to that of the island.

""I will remain here until I die,"" he said. ""If the water comes, it comes.""",mainstream,M16275,flat.earth

Among human achievements, the moon landing is one that a sliver of society holds in their hearts as a hoax.

Other topics, like the true age of the Earth, vaccines, and climate change are hotly debated subjects.

According to the science community, it’s background noise clogging the airwaves.

Scholars say an understanding of science is vital to an informed society, but there are gaps between the source, dissemination, and comprehension of that information.

Last week, Atlanta rapper B.o.B. (real name Bobby Ray Simmons, Jr.) tweeted to his 2.3 million Twitter followers that he can prove the Earth is flat based on the lack of curvature of the horizon.

That began a short-lived beef with famed astrophysicist Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, who debunked B.o.B. on the Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, calling it “a symptom of a larger problem.”

“There's a growing anti-intellectual strain in this country that may be the beginning of the end of our informed democracy,” Tyson said. “Of course, in a free society, you can and should think whatever you want. If you want to think the world is flat, go right ahead, but if you think the world is flat, and you have influence over others, as with successful rappers, or even presidential candidates, then being wrong becomes being harmful to the health, wealth, and security of our citizenry.”

Tyson intentionally did a “mic drop” before walking off stage.

B.o.B. is far from alone. Science literacy is relatively low in the United States and other countries.

Science Literacy Not the Best in the U.S.

According to the National Science Foundation, most Americans know the Earth travels around the sun but aren’t familiar with the basics of the scientific method.

A Pew Research Center survey of 3,278 adults found most Americans have a decent understanding of basic scientific information, such as the Earth’s core is the hottest layer. Other complicated concepts, like why the boiling point of water in higher altitudes occurs at a lower temperature, are tougher for them to grasp.

These are subjects that should be covered in high school. New ideas, findings, or technology, however, are even harder to permeate society.

Adam Ruben, Ph.D., a molecular biologist and author who has taught classes on the public’s perception of science at Johns Hopkins University, said issues like in vitro fertilization and genetically modified crops are often wrought with misunderstanding —as if scientists are making Frankenstein’s monster.

“It’s true people don’t understand science. The great thing about science is that it doesn’t require belief,” Ruben told Healthline. “There’s always going to be a contingent of society, no matter the technology, that views changes made to the way nature functions as bad.”

Science requires a certain level of skepticism in the name of discovery, but it also involves not ignoring data and facts to come to a conclusion.

“When you hear a new discovery, your reaction shouldn’t be to immediately dismiss it, and no scientist would want you to blindly accept it,” Ruben said. “Your reaction should be to want to learn more about it.”

Of all the science fallacies out there, Ruben assures people vaccines do not cause autism. He should know; he works on a vaccine for malaria.

But the discomfort of watching a stranger (i.e. nurse or doctor) stabbing his kids with needles does make him feel like a rotten dad.

“Now as a parent, I can see why people wouldn’t want to vaccinate their kids,” he said.

John Pellino, associate director of the Talcott Mountain Science Center, says there are a slew of issues at play in the public’s view of science.

These include authority, shortcuts in translation in the media, how humans like to reduce complexity, and that people prefer a familiar problem to a novel solution.

“That goes for science, relationships, cars, pets, all sorts of things,” Pellino told Healthline. “Change is hard. Change involves mental and physical work, and according to models of brain physiology, you actually re-wire neural networks in your brain matter to do this. No small task biologically, but we can actually do this sort of amazing brain morphing thing.”

All of these factors create a perfect storm of assumptions, comfort, and simplification, Pellino added.

“If you leave it at that, you can live a simple life with some potential disasters from false assumptions. If you push beyond it — something humans are famous for — you can live an amazingly exhilarating life with new discoveries around every bend,” he said. “That’s the feeling that makes it worth it all for people in science, nature, and engineering — that chance that you’ll be the first to the new, really new, thing.”

Anca Ioviţă, a physician in Romania, said when people have an opportunity to learn, formal or not, they can become “addicted to illusions” as a way to deal with their own mortality.

“That is why afterlife stories or get-rich-quick scams are so popular. Or alternative medicine that promises you a cancer cure that is one check apart,” she told Healthline. “And no matter how much science and medicine will progress, mortality and our own awareness of it will always exist. Hence, quacks will always have a job.”

For some, it’s overwhelming to grasp the Earth is actually billions of years old or that humans share a common ancestor with apes.

David Bell — a Catholic, licensed counselor, and former Air Force researcher — says ego may play into the disbelief we were created just as random bits in the universe.

“We are obviously special in some way, as evidenced by all of the things we have accomplished in this world, both bad and good. No other species has even come close,” he told Healthline. “This does make us special. This naturally leads one to wonder, why are we special? What made us special? The non-believer will simply say it was luck, but the believer will say that our Creator made us special.”

Bell says there are numerous psychological issues at play when people don’t believe certain things to be true. That includes confirmation bias, where we only seek knowledge that supports our pre-existing beliefs.

The existence of God, Bell says, is one thing science will never be able to answer because it’s not something that can be measured.

“Science is about how things work and change. Religion is about why things exist in the first place,” he said. “They are complementary areas of study, where each can inform the other, but neither can dismiss the other.”

So How Do We Improve Science Literacy?

Besides improving science education in schools, scientific communication is crucial.

New scientific research reaches the public through the filter of the media, which scientists feel often sensationalizes findings in headlines.

In a 2009 survey of more than 2,500 scientists, about three-quarters say the news does a poor job of distinguishing well-founded science, while about half say media oversimplification of scientific findings is a major problem.

Outspoken scientists like Tyson, Bill Nye, and Michio Kaku have inspired generations of new scientists through science education in the media.

Ruben, who watched “Mr. Wizard” growing up and now co-hosts the Science Channel’s “Outrageous Acts of Science,” said more scientists need to communicate more with those outside of scientific research.

“We do have a shortage of scientists who are watched by non-scientists,” he said.

Also, Ruben noted, is the capability for inaccurate information to spread easily via social media without verifying its accuracy.

“We can share with one click,” he said. “Reading takes time.”

Non-scientists’ influence in the media continues to get air time like Fox News host Bill O’Reilly saying there’s no way to explain tides. Or, as Tyson alluded to, presidential candidate Donald Trump spreading inaccurate information on issues from global warming to the Ebola virus.

Many experts, including Bell and Pellino, say these kinds of debates in the media are merely attention-seeking grabs at fame.

In the case of the flat Earth theory, who’s the better source of information? A rapper who dropped out of school in the ninth grade or the guy studying astrophysics since high school?

344,"It is stunning that I have to write this article, but I do. A popular rapper has launched a GoFundMe to prove that the Earth is flat. Several professional basketball players have also weighed in with their perspective. The picture of Earth below is pretty definitive, but there are basic meteorological ""pieces of evidence"" too. Herein, I explore three of the most important ones.

Sunsets: Have you ever watched a sunset? If so, it is a compelling""duh"" that the Earth is not flat. If you observe the horizon at sunset, typically the sun disappears from your view in a bottom-up direction. In a very simple experiment described on the PBS website,

This fact is how ancient sailors knew that Earth was spherical (and the fact that they did not sail off of some mythical edge). As the sun falls increasingly below the horizon, more of the shorter wavelength light is scattered out as it travels through more of the atmosphere. This scattering leaves the longer wavelength colors of reddish-orange.

General circulation of the atmosphere: It is intuitive to most people that it is warm in the tropical regions of the planet and cool in the polar regions. Because of the Earth's curvature, the mid-section of Earth receives more of the direct radiation from the sun. This means that there is more heat concentrated in the tropical atmosphere and ocean. The NASA satellite maps below illustrate that this radiation imbalance is prevalent irrespective of season.

The Earth is continually trying to remove the excess heat in the tropics. One way that Earth tries to put itself on a ""heat"" diet to remove excess heat in the mid-section is through poleward-moving ocean currents. A good example in the United States is the Gulf Stream. It is a warm, poleward flowing current. Hurricanes are another mechanism that transports excess heat from the tropics to the poles. The general circulation of the atmosphere also evolves because of the net imbalance of heating. In its simplest form, the air rises over the warmer tropics and sinks over the cooler polar regions. This is a thermally-direct circulation.

In reality, it is a bit more complex as described on NOAA website,

Since the earth rotates, the axis is tilted, and there is more land mass in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere, the actual global pattern is much more complicated. Instead of one large circulation between the poles and the equator, there are three circulations. (1) Hadley cell - Low latitude air movement toward the equator that with heating, rises vertically, with poleward movement in the upper atmosphere. This forms a convection cell that dominates tropical and sub-tropical climates. (2) Ferrel cell - A mid-latitude mean atmospheric circulation cell for weather named by Ferrel in the 19th century. In this cell the air flows poleward and eastward near the surface and equatorward and westward at higher levels. (3) Polar cell - Air rises, diverges, and travels toward the poles. Once over the poles, the air sinks, forming the polar highs. At the surface air diverges outward from the polar highs. Surface winds in the polar cell are easterly (polar easterlies).

This general circulation model is directly tied to global patterns of high-low pressure, jet streams, and weather systems.

Weather radar: I cut my teeth as a radar meteorologist. Some of my earliest graduate work at Florida State University developed weather radar algorithms to track hurricanes. I also teach a radar and mesoscale meteorology course at the University of Georgia. One of the fundamental concepts that we discuss is how curvature of the Earth impacts rainfall detection. The example at a National Weather Service website describes it well,

A storm between the Birmingham (BMX) and Maxwell AFB (MXX) radars (see image below). If the storm is a good distance away from BMX, due to the fact that the radar beam is straight and doesn't follow the Earth's surface, the lowest elevation scan from BMX may only be able to ""see"" into the middle portion of the storm. If that same storm is closer to MXX, this will allow us to ""look"" into the lower portion of that same storm, possibly allowing us to detect a rotational couplet closer to the Earth's surface. From this, we could infer that given the right circumstances, the formation of a tornado is possible.

By the way, I still cannot believe I had to write this.",mainstream,M15299,flat.earth
1329,"Mapping one of the flattest parts of the planet will help satellite calibration.

A precise topographical map has been made of one of the flattest places on Earth: the salar de Uyuni, a vast plain of white cemented salt in the mountains of Bolivia. The ground survey, aided by global positioning systems (GPS), shows variations in elevation of less than a metre across an area almost half the size of Wales.

Intriguingly, the work reveals bumps in the salt that lie above lumps of dense rock buried several kilometres below, just as water will bulge over a bump on the ocean floor. Knowing exactly where these bumps lie will help researchers to use the flat as a giant calibration device for satellite-based radar and laser altimeters.

Adrian Borsa, a geophysicist at the US Geological Survey in Pasadena, California, led the work that is now reporting the most precise GPS characterization yet of the salt flat, accurate to 2.2 centimetres. Borsa and his colleagues began the research in 2002, with a campaign that combined data from fixed GPS stations with ‘kinematic GPS’ data obtained by crisscrossing the salar in trucks fitted with GPS antennae. “It’s as if you’re on a white ocean with no waves,” says Borsa. “You see the horizon, the curvature of Earth. It’s absolutely featureless.”

The study was commissioned specifically as a way to calibrate NASA’s ICESat, launched in 2003 to study ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. Satellites can calibrate their altimeters by bouncing signals off the ocean surface, the height of which is well established. But because of atmospheric interference, tides and waves, there are uncertainties. Borsa says the salar, now so accurately mapped and with dry, clear skies, is about five times better than the ocean as a reference point.

The results have been helpful, says Sinead Farrell, a researcher at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is using ICESat to measure changes in sea ice. “It’s the first calibration surface that we look at,” she says. “The information that they provide is useful to all the other teams.” She adds that the salt flat is also being used for Envisat, a European satellite, and could be used to calibrate future orbiters such as Cryosat-2, a planned European ice-monitoring mission.

Whereas the Earth-observing community likes the flatness of the salar, geologists are interested in the tiny undulations.

The strength of gravity varies from place to place around Earth — imperceptibly to humans but in ways that scientists have mapped precisely — owing to the density of objects nearby. Borsa found that the salt had created faint mounds of some 40 centimetres in height over regions of slightly higher gravity, owing to high-density volcanic rocks kilometres below. “We found a rare breed of topography,” says Borsa, who says that this is the first time a land surface has been shown to undulate in step with the gravitational field like this. “Here’s a place where you see the imprint of the gravitational field due to buried mountain ranges.”

Borsa has a theory as to how this happened. When the salar floods, as it does every five years or so, salt dissolves and, in solution, flows to regions of higher gravity, he says.

This phenomenon is already known to oceanographers: the free-standing ocean surface changes slightly to match the pull of gravity underneath. So there are slight bulges in the ocean in places directly above submarine seamounts. “We know that ocean surfaces follow the gravitational potential surface: the geoid,” says Farrell, who was not a part of the study. “It is a new result to show that the salt flat also follows the geoid.”

The next step for those with a geological interest, Borsa says, is to take out the portion of the elevation variations that are due to gravity and see what’s left. So far, he is seeing a strange, regularly patterned checkerboard surface. He doesn’t know what could produce it, but speculates that it could reflect the imprint of periodic pressures due to prevailing winds. Working out the forces that produce this pattern could be useful if similar phenomena are ever spotted on another planet, he says. “Now we’ve got an analogue on Earth.”",mainstream,M16400,flat.earth
582,"“Community – How to live together? How to communicate effectively?

Who knows how we’ve experienced a sense of community in other dimensions, once upon a long time ago? We may all live with a cellular/DNA – memory of unity and oneness from an existence before the start of the veiling process. A memory in and of Awakening.

It seems that now, after living with a “horizontal” consciousness expansion, limited by the concept of material expansion on a planet seemingly existing as a self-contained life form, first as a flat Earth, than as a globe and centre of “the Universe” (yet unseen) after Galilei’s exclamation “And yet she’s round!”

As a celestial body circling around the Sun, with other space-bodies forming the Solar System as yet another part of the entire Galaxy, in our technologically more advanced time, observed through the eyes of cameras, we’re all touched and affected by a storm of change that is in progress at a 90 degree angle: a “vertical” consciousness expansion in much tumult, clanging and banging, much topsy turvy.

I choose a direction North-South for ease of understanding dimensional shifts in sync with the term “Ascension” which means to many religious people “rising up to the heavens” with images illustrating a figure carried on the weightless substance of clouds.

When rising above the quirkiness of personal styles in approach and awake and alert to the vagueness of presence and intention (in virtual communications) we can step forward and connect by addressing the issues that are rising within us, communicating our feelings and the experience of how actions of others affect us and how we feel our own actions affect others. By being informed about their impact on others who make an effort to offer feedback, honouring their own value as much as the value of the person on the other side of the screen, or table.

The desire that one’s presence matters in a community, can lead to different expressions, depending on a force of will, making a point for the sake of fanatism, a need for attention or competition, by challenging an authority, or a warm-hearted service as a means to fulfilment of one’s own desire in sync with one’s desire to serve a general sense of wellbeing in all.

Issues that are rising between 2 people, showing up in their one-on-one communication online, or in the practice of working together in the physical world, should best be kept in that close encounter of a duet. It takes two to tango and not one or more than 2, for isn’t stepping on each other’s toes sufficient pain to pay attention properly?

To me, it’s an interesting subject to discuss community-creation and without expecting you or others here to address all of them, here are a couple of questions:

– How does it look like, your favoured community? How would you describe your life in it?

 – What makes or breaks a community?

 – What’s the difference in a virtual and physical community? If there’s one at all.

 – What’s causing members of a community to feel inspired and at ease?

 – What’s required to maintain a community in liveliness and sparkly vibes, open to change?

 – Should there be an intention and foundation on which a community is built and functioning?

 – Should a community-to-be start with a gathering of people at random, spontaneously/casually formed?

 – Is a community a work in progress, with a common interest showing up in due time, which my become the core of an intentional community?

 – Should a community grow organically, by a coming and going of members without a fixed plan for an “end-product” or “end-result?”

 – Are members of a community open to leaving and trying out different forms of communities?

 – Should a community be a living organism that is in motion and change always.

Moving around freely nd explore different forms of community is a great learning curve in my perception. When a genuine attempt is made to study, attune and learn. Use of discernment can be trained due to a variety of experiences and encounters with people of all walks of life and even ET-races. In the latter case communication becomes a whole new concept, I imagine.

To me, the form and subject of a chosen service are two very different things.

– Is transparency of decision making and reports of financial manoeuvers to all members of a community, who contribute financially, a must and a benefit?

There are questions about community living “How to live together?” that countless human generations have pondered and discussed, forgotten, buried and dug up, dusted off and, at times, placed on an altar. The following statement I hold close to my heart:

“Once upon a time in the civilized world the monarch and the public servants who honoured their oath of allegiance, delivered to the people freedom, justice, leisure and instruction by facilitating instruction and apprenticeship. The city-state encouraged each individual to develop special skills appropriate to the ascribed natural or genetic abilities of that individual, to meet the many needs of the wider community, the pursuit of excellence in each department was a matter of honour where self-interest led to a duty of care towards fellow citizens and the overall success of that community” Edmund Marriage 2004

Richard Hoaglands Dark Mission: Coverups, Lies, and Calling for a New World Order!

'Sincle the faked moon landings in 1969 NASA has moved onto faking Mars landings with the 1976 Viking, 1997 Pathfinder, and 2007 Phoenix. Right after 'landing' they got straight to work photo shopping the famous 'Face on Mars,' Martian pyramids, and the supposed Martian city of Cydonia. NASA shills like Richard Hoagland and Steven Greer have ever since been propagating the idea that this and other 'evidence' proves the existence of extra-terrestrial aliens. Just like the faked Moon landings, however, their science fiction 'Mars' landings are utter bold faced lies.'

One of the uses of the Phoenix Project, in the use of Time Tunnels, was to provide backup to the Martian Colonies. The Martian Colonies have been there since the early 1970s. We went publicly to the moon in 1969. Actually the Germans were there in 1947. And we were there in 1962 with a joint U.S.-Russian expedition. They went to Mars, May 22, 1962. The movie, Altenative 3, done by Anglia Television, April 1, 1977, which is available in the underground, outlines it completely. It shows the actual transmission. The color shots by TV back from Mars, as this Explorer moved and landed. We have colonies there in Mars from the late 1960s or maybe early 1970s onward. They found many artifacts there. There is more than one wrecked city. And of course there is the famous face on Mars, the Pyramids and that whole complex that Dr. Richard Hoagland has talked about and gone public on. There are two videos on this plus his book.

 What they found on the surface indicated there was much more there that they could not find that was buried. And they had not brought with them, and did not have the capabilities of heavy earth-moving equipment on Mars at that time. They didnt have any Cats. Big tractors and that sort of stuff. They were too heavy to bring up.

 So, a request went by radio back to Earth, We believe there are underground installations here. Weve seen openings that are sealed. Can you guys down there tell us what to do? Well, the information went to Montauk, to the Phoenix Project. And they sent back information, Well, give us some coordinates on the surface of Mars where you think these locations are. And they did. And they said, Well investigate it. And they did. Because they could go any place with the tunnel, they went to Mars to the coordinates.

 And first they didnt send anybody. They ran a tunnel into what they thought might be an underground area and rather than risk killing anybody by burying them in solid rock, they sent a camera, a remote-view camera. We found out there was an actual cavern and it was safe. Then Montauk sent people. Duncan and I were in that crew. The first crew that went was directed by Montauk to explore the underground of Mars. It's not mentioned in the book who went, but we went. And there were probably others. We went several times. We found all kinds of artifacts. We found a still functional underground lighting system, a power system. We found it and turned it on and it still worked. No evidence of life. A lot of artifacts, files, records, religious artifacts, statuary, all stored like it was a storeroom -- a huge storeroom.

904,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc’s new iPhones will use recycled rare earth elements in a key component, the company said on Wednesday.

Apple said it will use recycled rare earths in its “Taptic Engine,” a part that lets iPhones mimic a physical button click despite being a flat pane of glass. The part is about one-quarter of the rare earth elements inside the iPhone models.

Rare earths, a group of 17 specialized minerals, have become a flash point in trade tensions between the United States and China. The elements are used in weapons, consumer electronics and other goods.

China dominates the processing of the raw minerals, and has implied through its state-controlled media that it could restrict rare earths sales to the United States, just as it did to Japan after a diplomatic dispute in 2010.

Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said Apple’s use of recycled rare earths was “not related” to trade tensions but could help it maintain a steady supply.

“This is one of those happy coincidences where what is good for the planet is really good for business at the same time,” Jackson told Reuters. “One of the things we talk about a lot internally, just in general, is how much more resilient this makes our supply chain.”

In consumer electronics, rare earths reside in tiny speakers and actuators. The parts are so small that collecting them for recycling is difficult and expensive.

For now, Apple will use recycled rare earths from an outside supplier, not from previously used iPhones. Apple declined to name the supplier or say what products the rare earths were recovered from, though the company did say the source was post-industrial, meaning material generated during manufacturing processes rather than from discarded consumer products.

Jackson said that Apple’s scale - new iPhone models are typically sell tens of millions of units per year - helped make the project economically viable.

“We have essentially made a market for this entrepreneur, this innovator, who found a way to recycle rare earths,” Jackson said.

Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company focused on repairing and reusing electronics, said Apple’s move was a first for the industry.

“Rare earth elements aren’t being recycled from electronics right now, and that’s a huge problem — China has a stranglehold on the virgin material supply,” Wiens said. “This is a great idea — Apple could single-handedly create a hugely needed market for recycled rare earths.”

Apple often aims to reuse parts from its old devices.

Apple said on Wednesday that aluminum from enclosures recovered through its trade-in programs will be melted down and made into new MacBook Air laptop computers. The company previously disclosed that cobalt recovered from iPhone batteries disassembled by robots at its recycling labs in Texas is put into new iPhone batteries.

Apple is experimenting with ways to recover rare earths from its phones using its robots, which can remove tiny parts and separate them into collection bins to aggregate enough material to make recycling viable.

The company is also researching ways that conventional recyclers, who shred devices and separate out the various materials, could tweak their lines to recover the elements, information that Jackson said Apple is open to sharing.

“There are some innovations of ours that we actually want people to copy. So as much as possible - as long as it doesn’t give away some of our other design and engineering innovation - we are happy to bring along the recycling industry,” Jackson said. “We have started to be much more transparent around this technology development than we usually are.”",mainstream,M11885,flat.earth

1121,"Come here, Imma gonna told you something. Gonna teach you about The Monster today! Instead of my usual review of the week, I’m going to put up for your reading pleasure, five of my articles you may, or may not have seen from the five hundred sum odd pieces the Tea Party Tribune has been kind enough to publish for me over the last three years.

When you write an article you tend to think it’s a masterpiece. I bury “Easter Eggs” in every one. A good example of that is in “New Baby and The Trip To Bountiful,” where in one line I replaced “The Principal” with the words “The Principle” alluding to polygamy. It got by a lot of people but the principal who let my grandson go skipping across Main Street in Brigham City got my point, and he’s been mad ever since. Sorry for Party rocking Dude! I also include at least one mistake for liberals who search my stuff to challenge my literacy. An it’s for its or a comma for a period.

For every fifty to one hundred articles that are penned, one will be the “monster!” While on a typical run an article will struggle for reads, these certain works will take off a bit faster. Then you’ll notice a comment later on that article, but not from the Trib. It’ll come from USA Today, or some other publication where part or all of the article was used or cited. That’s when you go back and check the numbers and said article will move into the “DAYUM” section. These five are those types of works.

I didn’t learn journalism in any college. I learned to spin a yarn in Nashville. The same methods that make a song “cook” will chicken fry an article. Methods like make a point and return to it toward the end to reinforce the theme. Don’t keep repeating “ands” and “buts.” Write like you speak. I don’t have a big problem with spelling because I’m ignorant and don’t use a whole lot of big words. I try not to lie . . . much, but I’ll use innuendo to worm around a subject or person (such as that principal) to make my point. FYI: The reason my five year old grand baby got out in the street unsupervised was he was too infatuated with a certain teacher. Little light hearted jab on an embarrassing era of Mormon history, add a dash of innuendo and voila! Principal soup! But you know I’m bad.

While I’m on that subject, I want to explain why I pick on Mormons so often. Even though I’m an old “Reptile Bait” I’ve been covered UP with Latter Day Saints for over thirty years. My wife’s and for that matter my daughter in law’s family are Temple Worthy all the way back to Joseph Smith. I did write Joseph Did You Know about the Mormon culture, and I’m fascinated with their history, but if I ever stepped into a Temple my hair would catch on fire. I use the same method when addressing race baiters, Political Correctness, and people who are confused by common sense.

I read my stuff out loud. That’s an old songwriter’s trick. My friends think I’m crazy because I always seem to be talking to myself. If it won’t roll smoothly off your tongue it will irritate or confuse the reader. Finding subjects to write about is not hard. I can actually write about things I know very little of. When I began to write for Raging Elephants Radio on Doc Greene’s show I actually knew very little about the Texas movements of secession and nullification. In time I learned, but for about six months it was mostly style, style, style.

I do research. Usually on YouTube. I will sometimes spend up to a week familiarizing myself with a subject before I write anything about it. One subject I never could really cope with was the Flat Earth Society. I tried, but I simply couldn’t drink enough whiskey to make any sense out of it. I try not to rag on the Cartels or Muslims too much because I don’t want to get bombed or shot.

That all having been said, I think you will enjoy these pieces. Like a hit song I could feel them coming off my pen, so to speak. Each one directly addresses some facet of the human experience. Each one promoted itself to the “DAYUM” status. I don’t buy into inspiration but I will say these five came out of nowhere, so I guess there is someone out there looking out for us. It has been my honor and my joy to share with you guys and gals.

WHEN Boris Yeltsin watched the VE Day parade from the roof of Lenin's Tomb, his foreign friends, Clinton, Major et al, huddled warily together on a makeshift platform some way off.

Cunningly, he turned off the light and the little creatures crawled to the front again, allowing his wife to blot all 15 of them off his eye.

1042,"Sometimes when you're reading Neal Stephenson, he doesn't just seem like one of the best novelists writing in English right now; he seems like the only one. No other author embeds characters in an authentically contemporary Web of technological connections the way Stephenson does. His characters text and tweet and play massively multiplayer games. When they check their e-mail, they do it on their phones, not their computers; when they make phone calls, they do it on their computers via Skype, not their phones.

You can see why other writers let this stuff slide. You have to come up with new kinds of stories in a networked world. The usual missed connections and mistaken identities don't cut it  how many Shakespearean tragedies could have been averted with GPS and Facebook? Not that we don't have problems now, God knows, but when you take our modern technological predicament seriously, you realize that those old problems have to be rerouted, and that the stories have to change shape accordingly. They start to become less about missed connections and more about overconnectedness. They start to look like Reamde.

Reamde is Stephenson's 10th novel (not counting his occasional collaborations and the unclassifiable online fiction project The Mongoliad), and he has yet to write an uninteresting one. In Reamde we find him slimming down to middleweight after five straight heavyweight bouts: the cryptographical epic Cryptonomicon, the 2,500-page three-novel Baroque Cycle and then Anathem, a philosophical novel set on an alt-universe earth where monasteries are consecrated to higher mathematics. Stephenson's abiding preoccupation is information flow, and how information shapes the lives of the humans around and through whom it flows. He is generally tagged as a science-fiction novelist, but that categorization is difficult to support on the evidence  the Baroque Cycle was set in the 17th and 18th centuries and stuck to existing history, more or less. (Isaac Newton is a major character; the action turns on his little-known role as Master of the Mint.) ""Science fiction"" describes Stephenson's interests, but not his methods.

While recognizably Stephensonian, Reamde is less about the flow of information through global networks than it is about the flow of bullets out of guns. This is, first and foremost, a Bourne-style international thriller, and as such its intellectual sites are set lower than those of its immediate predecessors. The hero of Reamde is  or at first appears to be  Richard Forthrast, founder of a World of Warcraftesque massively multiplayer fantasy game called T'Rain. Richard is an amiable enough guy in his 50s, living in Seattle, with way too much money and way too little in the way of emotional or, for that matter, physical connections to the world around him. This changes when he hires his niece Zula, an Eritrean refugee adopted by his sister, and takes a mentor's interest in her.

Zula is a crack programmer but not, it turns out, a crack picker of boyfriends. Hers sells stolen information to some Russian gangsters, and the deal goes south when a virus from T'Rain called Reamde  the intentional typo stops bothering you after a while, though it doesn't get easier to pronounce  encrypts the data. The gangsters promptly kidnap the boyfriend and Zula and head off in search of the virus writer, who's got an IP address in China, specifically in the city of Xiamen. At this point Zula takes over as the story's focus. She's press-ganged into a pack of captive hackers and soldiers of fortune who pursue first the virus writers and then, as the narrative upshifts, a bin Ladenesque Islamic terrorist. (The change of focus is a bit jarring. But it's a long story  Reamde clocks in at over 1,000 pages.)

The pace of Reamde is rapid and unwavering  the plot automatically extrudes twists, new settings and even fresh major characters at precisely calibrated intervals. The characters ping-pong around the globe as if geography were an afterthought and communicate via a pidgin English largely based on video games, which is their shared frame of reference. These are people who, in any earlier incarnation of human civilization, would never have met one another. But now they have, and not because they wished to, but because the logic of money and information requires it, and because the now flat, frictionless earth no longer has the power to keep them apart.

But the story of Reamde is mostly there as a superstructure for Stephenson's observations about how the world around us actually works  the background is the foreground. There's a marvelous sequence late in the book when the characters become transfixed by what's happening on a computer, and Stephenson, without pausing or even slowing down the action, weaves in a concise explanation of how a computer monitor works and why it looks the way it does. You don't bog down in it  the explanation is the action and the moment feels real, because we understand not just what's happening but also why and how, down to the submolecular level.

This realness serves Stephenson's themes well: he likes to play with the sharp sheer between the world as it is and how it appears in the cartoon looking glass of pop culture. Asked why the Russian criminals think he and Zula can find the author of Reamde, a no-nonsense Hungarian programmer replies, ""Because we are hackers, and they have seen movies."" The joke of watching a bunch of video-game addicts get caught up in actual shootouts never gets old: right in the middle of a finely turned Mexican standoff on a dock in Xiamen, the terrorist delivers a lecture on the eccentricities of the firing mechanism of the Makarov pistol that his opponent is holding against his head. In Stephenson's world, victory generally goes to the guy who's read the manual.

If there is an overarching theme to Reamde, it's the importance of drilling down through easy bull---- explanations to the tough, complicated substrate of the real world beneath  the importance of not satisfying yourself with the vague approximations of video games and, for that matter, sub-Stephensonian writers. Toward the end of the book, Richard, the archillusionist of T'Rain, finds himself on the run and in desperate nonvirtual danger, but instead of despairing he finds his situation perversely exhilarating: ""No one could reach him via phone or e-mail, Twitter or Facebook, and bother him. His whole mind, his whole attention was focused on one thing for the first time that he could remember."" It's worthy of note that Stephenson  an early prophet of virtual reality, whose novel Snow Crash materially influenced the development of the Internet itself  is less interested in the consensual hallucinations of cyberspace than he is in the stuff we use it to escape from. The Internet is all well and good, but reality is still the ultimate hack.

128,"What is Term Structure Of Interest Rates?

Term structure of interest rates, commonly known as the yield curve, depicts the interest rates of similar quality bonds at different maturities.

Essentially, term structure of interest rates is the relationship between interest rates or bond yields and different terms or maturities. When graphed, the term structure of interest rates is known as a yield curve, and it plays a crucial role in identifying the current state of an economy. The term structure of interest rates reflects expectations of market participants about future changes in interest rates and their assessment of monetary policy conditions.

In general terms, yields increase in line with maturity, giving rise to an upward-sloping, or normal, yield curve. The yield curve is primarily used to illustrate the term structure of interest rates for standard U.S. government-issued securities. This is important as it is a gauge of the debt market's feeling about risk. The most frequently reported yield curve compares the three-month, two-year, five-year, 10-year, and 30-year U.S. Treasury debt. (Yield curve rates are usually available at the Treasury's interest rate web sites by 6:00 p.m. ET each trading day),

The term of the structure of interest rates has three primary shapes.
• Upward sloping—long term yields are higher than short term yields. This is considered to be the ""normal"" slope of the yield curve and signals that the economy is in an expansionary mode.
• Downward sloping—short term yields are higher than long term yields. Dubbed as an ""inverted"" yield curve and signifies that the economy is in, or about to enter, a recessive period.
• Flat—very little variation between short and long term yields. Signals that the market is unsure about the future direction of the economy.

This yield curve is considered the benchmark for the credit market, as it reports the yields of risk-free fixed income investments across a range of maturities. In the credit market, banks and lenders use this benchmark as a gauge for determining lending and savings rates. Yields along the U.S. Treasury yield curve are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate. Other yield curves can also be developed based upon a comparison of credit investments with similar risk characteristics.

Most often, the Treasury yield curve is upward-sloping. One basic explanation for this phenomenon is that investors demand higher interest rates for longer-term investments as compensation for investing their money in longer-duration investments. Occasionally, long-term yields may fall below short-term yields, creating an inverted yield curve that is generally regarded as a harbinger of recession.

The Outlook for the Overall Credit Market

The term structure of interest rates and the direction of the yield curve can be used to judge the overall credit market environment. A flattening of the yield curve means longer-term rates are falling in comparison to short-term rates, which could have implications for a recession. When short-term rates begin to exceed long-term rates, the yield curve is inverted, and a recession is likely occurring or approaching.

When longer-term rates fall below shorter-term rates, the outlook for credit over the long term is weak. This is often consistent with a weak or recessionary economy, which is defined by two consecutive periods of negative growth in the gross domestic product (GDP). While other factors, including foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries, can also result in an inverted yield curve, historically, an inverted yield curve has been an indicator of an impending recession in the United States.",mainstream,M0a2c2,flat.earth
221,"BARSTOW, Calif. -- A California man who said he wanted to fly to the edge of outer space to see if the world is round has died after his home-built rocket blasted off into the desert sky and plunged back to earth.

“Mad"" Mike Hughes was killed on Saturday afternoon after his rocket crashed on private property near Barstow, California.

Waldo Stakes, a colleague who was at the rocket launch, said Hughes, 64, was killed.

The Science Channel said on it had been chronicling Hughes' journey and that “thoughts & prayers go out to his family & friends during this difficult time.”

“It was always his dream to do this launch,” the message said.

Hughes also was a limousine driver, who held the Guinness world record for “longest limousine ramp jump,” for jumping 103 feet (31 meters) in a Lincoln Town Car stretch limousine, at a speedway in 2002.

A video on TMZ.com showed the rocket taking off, with what appears to be a parachute tearing off during the launch. The steam-powered rocket streaks upward, then takes around 10 seconds to fall straight back to earth. Shrieks can be heard as the rocket plows into the desert.

Freelance journalist Justin Chapman, who was at the scene, said the rocket appeared to rub against the launch apparatus, which might have caused the mishap with the parachute.

In March 2018, Hughes propelled himself about 1,875 feet (570 meters) into the air. He deployed one parachute and then a second one but still had a hard landing in the Mojave Desert in California, and injured his back.

“This thing wants to kill you 10 different ways,” Hughes said after that launch. “This thing will kill you in a heartbeat.""

He said in a video that his goal was to eventually fly to the edge of outer space to determine for himself whether the world is round.

“I don't want to take anyone else's word for it,” he said in the video, posted on the BBC News website. “I don't know if the world is flat or round.”

In another video posted on his YouTube site, Hughes said he also wanted “to convince people they can do things that are extraordinary with their lives.”

“My story really is incredible,” Hughes once told The Associated Press. “It’s got a bunch of story lines — the garage-built thing. I’m an older guy. It’s out in the middle of nowhere, plus the Flat Earth. The problem is it brings out all the nuts also.”",mainstream,M14c8e,flat.earth

The culinary students cooked for us, you know, every meal. Our first thought when we got off the plane and we saw the school buses coming in and we learned later they had come off strike to actually help carry us to whereever we had to go. And we thought we were going to be sleeping on a floor somewhere, eating Doritos from the local mini-mart we had no idea what was going to happen. And here everyone brought in food, bed linens, you know, mattresses from the Walmart. It was overwhelming.""

""It's been a continuous almost family-like relationship where we email each other, we send Christmas cards, we're always in touch ... I think we just have this bond over what happened.

We found out that the mayor of our town [Morris Plains, New Jersey] he met them [Mac and Nellie Moss] when they came over, and we're going to have a twinning of our cities they call it, and exchange flags and banners and sort of promote each others towns, and I believe they're considering taking our town logo, which is the 'Community of Caring' and just creating this relationship between our two towns.""

""We've become ambassadors, I think ... And you know we have told our story over and over again and people never ceased to be amazed and they want to hear more when we talk about it. And when I meet someone on business or a new person and ... if the subject of 9/11 comes up and 'Where were you?', I always have the most rivetting story because this is the only bright spot in that day. This is the only goodness that anyone can really find. It's kind of amazing. We've said we saw the darkest side of humanity and the brightest side of humanity on the same day.""

""September 11, 2001 began what you might call our ""love affair"" with Newfoundland. In five visits since our unexpected trip in 2001, we've been back in 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. Each time we visit with our Pond Six friends - three dear couples who live on Little Cobb's Pond.

We've seen some of the province by boat, we've driven hundreds of miles through some quaint, small coastal towns, dined with the locals, explored L'Anse aux Meadows and the Northern Arm, saw our first icebergs up close and personal on a boat tour, roasted hot dogs with our Pond Six friends, enjoyed some of the most amazing sunsets ever on Little Cobb's Pond and even hiked to one of the ""Four Corners of the Flat Earth."" And yes, we were ""Screeched In"" by two of our Pond Six friends, Mac Moss and Ron Walsh. That makes us official Newfies.

We've tried (and liked!) moose stew, moose burgers and moose sausages; the freshest salmon ever (the kind you DON'T get in New Jersey); cod cheeks and cod tongues; pease pudding; Jigg's Dinner; bakeapple jam; and fish and brewis. Perhaps on this next trip we'll try Seal Flipper Pie.

There are so many other places in the world to visit but we keep heading back to Newfoundland. It's the connection we have with the Pond Six, our second family, and the love of the province and people. Each year we spent more time with the Pond Six. We have quite a bond.

78,"Yeah, it’s not a joke. A Ph.D. Student has presented a thesis claiming the Earth is FLAT, stationary, the center of the universe and only around 13,500 years old. Yup, you read right. The thesis was submitted to two assessors, thus passing the first stage of approvals.

The idea that the Earth is ‘Flat’ is, in fact, a relatively new theory. In fact, before anyone came up with the idea we live on a flat plane, people knew very well the Earth was round.

Even though there are countless images of our planet, and numerous videos which have been recorded from space, there are still some who argue the Earth is in fact flat. One of them is a Ph.D. student who rocked the Arab scientific community when she presented her thesis claiming the Earth is FLAT, stationary, the center of the universe and only around 13,500 years old. Yup, you read right.

Not only did he suggest we live on a flat Earth, he also rejected scientific theories presented by Newton and Einstein, astronomical discoveries made by Copernicus and Kepler, the Big Bang theory, atmospheric and geological activity, most of modern climatology, and basically all other scientific teachings made in the past.

According to an article written by the Gulf News, the student presented her thesis after a staggering five years of work. Eventually, it was submitted to two assessors, thus passing the first stage of approvals. The reports were expected soon, for the thesis defense to be scheduled.

This ‘shocking’ doctoral thesis suggests that the planet we live on is flat, very young and that it remains stationary at the MIDDLE of the universe. Furthermore—if that wasn’t enough—the thesis claims that the Sun has an average diameter of 1,135 kilometers and NOT 1.4 million km. The moon has a width of 908km, and are located 687 and 23 times closer to Earth respectively. In addition, the thesis claims there are 11 planets and STARS in the sky are LIMITED in number and have a diameter of 292 kilometers and not millions of kilometers.



In the meantime, the President of the Tunisian Astronomical Association somehow managed to get his hands on a leaked copy of the thesis, proving it was not a hoax and posted in on Facebook.

As noted by Gulf News, many people consider these claims ridiculous, and scandalous since the thesis firmly rejects ALL modern science. Others, however, have found it extremely disturbing since the thesis was written by a Ph.D. science student, and the professor is the ‘highest’ in academia.

Furthermore, Gulf News adds: “Indeed, we find in the conclusions of the thesis clear indications of this stand and approach, expressions such as: “using physical and religious arguments”, “also proving the world scale of [Noah’s] flood”, “proposed a new kinematic approach that conforms to the verses of the Quran”, “the roles of the stars are: (1) to be ornaments of the sky; (2) to stone the devils; and (3) as signs to guide creatures in the darkness of earth”; and finally “the geo-centric model… accords with the verses of the Quran and the pronouncements of our Prophet.”",conspiracy,C02090,flat.earth
1186,"The eight teams with the worst records in the NBA, the ones not invited to Orlando for the NBA’s restart — Warriors, Timberwolves, Cavaliers, Hawks, Pistons, Knicks, Bulls, and Hornets — have been asking the NBA to organize workouts and games for them, so they don’t lose ground to the teams in the bubble.

ESPN’s Jackie MacMullen reports that is close to coming together in the form of a second NBA bubble in Chicago.

The details are still being hammered out, and teams continue to push for an alternative plan that would enable them to hold mini-camps within their local markets and to explore the idea of establishing regional sites where teams could scrimmage against each other.

This second bubble likely would take place in September, while the playoffs take place down into Orlando. Not every team is fully on board.

The eight teams had been concerned that going from March to December without meaningful games — while the other 22 teams had training camps and played at least eight games — would put the development of their young players and cultures behind. Teams pushed for practices and some organized games, although some franchises have pushed harder than others.

Michelle Roberts, the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association, reportedly is insistent that if the eight teams get together in Chicago the players be protected by the same protocols in place in Orlando.

“Unless we could replicate in every way the protocol that’s been established for Orlando, I’d be – I’m being tame now – suspicious,” Roberts said last week in a conference call with reporters. “I think there are conversations that could be had if there’s anything we can do with the other eight teams. I know there are some players, particularly young players, that seem concerned they’re not getting enough [opportunities]…

“But I am very concerned and frankly, my concern aside, our players, our teams are very concerned about any — in terms of play that doesn’t have the same guarantees of safety and health that we’ve provided for the teams in Orlando. So yeah, never say never, but there’s a standard. It’s a standard that’s got to be met.”

Expect an NBA Chicago bubble to come together in some form. Some of the eight teams on the outside — the Atlanta Hawks with their young core, for example — have pushed hard to get their players opportunities for games and workouts. Each of the eight teams are in different spots, however, and have different motivations. Golden State likely will not send Stephen Curry or Klay Thompson, this would be about getting younger players some extra run.",mainstream,M15631,flat.earth

1220,"A honeycombed cave formed untold millennia ago beneath what is now southeastern Minnesota. Larry Edwards is standing in a subterranean chamber, his headlamp illuminating a series of mineral formations. From the cathedral-like ceiling dangle tubes known as soda straws. Along a waist-high ledge squats a trio of stout stalagmites, their surfaces slick with ecru-colored ooze. “Now that’s the kind of thing we might be interested in,” Edwards says, bending to peer at one.

I hear the plink, plink, plink of falling droplets. One hits the top of a stalagmite, then spreads out, laying down a thin film of the mineral calcium carbonate, or calcite, from rainwater seeping though limestone. Drop by drop the stalagmite has grown to its present height—about 18 inches—over who knows how many centuries.

Edwards, a geochemist at the University of Minnesota and a pioneer in the use of cave formations to document ancient climate, is not planning to collect stalagmites today. But two specimens severed from their moorings when the owner of the cave complex, Spring Valley Caverns, opened a deeper passageway recently provided Edwards and his colleagues with a record of extreme rainfall events over the past 3,000 years. Edwards wonders if some of Spring Valley’s stalagmites could contain older records still, dating back to when giant glaciers covered much of the Northern Hemisphere or even to one of the distant warm periods, or interglacials, that punctuated the ice age world.

A short time later, we retrace our steps, navigating the sequence of walkways and ladders that leads to the cave’s entrance. As we step into the light, Edwards turns to me. “Do you notice all the sounds, all the smells?” he says. “When you come up, they seem so pronounced.” Edwards, renowned among paleoclimatologists for his cave findings, isn’t much of a spelunker. “It’s not that I’m claustrophobic,” he says with a shrug, “I just like it better up here.”

To Edwards, a stalagmite is more than a chunk of geology that looks like a modern sculpture: It’s a collection of climate sensors, rather like tree rings but extending often hundreds of thousands of years back in time. Perhaps the only other earthly archives that have provided such a high-resolution portrait of the past half-million years are ice cores.

But unlike ice, caves can be found all over the world. “I would go so far as to say that these are among the most important paleoclimate records we have,” David Battisti, a University of Washington atmospheric scientist, says of the cave data.

From Edwards’ lab is emerging a high-resolution picture of precipitation patterns long ago. Just as important, his work is providing the scientific community with an increasingly precise time scale, one that is bringing other records into alignment. Edwards and his colleagues have used cave formations to tighten up the timing for ancient rises in carbon dioxide locked into Antarctica’s ice. They’ve even used them to date skeletal remains that trace human migration routes.

Why should we care about what happened so long ago? A reason can be found in the mounting nervousness over the consequences of global warming. With heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere already reaching levels not seen for at least 800,000 years, scientists like Edwards worry that weather patterns could undergo sudden, destabilizing changes.

Ice cores from Greenland, for instance, reveal a sequence of abrupt temperature oscillations over the past 140,000 years, with severe cold snaps leavened by a series of sudden, if ephemeral, warmings. Eerily similar oscillations are now showing up in the precipitation records from caves. In a landmark study, Edwards and his collaborators compared the precipitation swings captured by Hulu Cave on the outskirts of Nanjing, China, with temperatures encoded by Greenland’s ice. Plotted as graphs, and positioned side by side, the dips and valleys in both records are sharp and—for the 60,000-year period covered by the stalagmites—synchronous.",mainstream,M111f3,flat.earth
429,"THE biggest solar flare since 2017 and new sunspots suggests our star could be 'waking up', according to Nasa.

The US space agency's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) recently spotted the largest flare to come from the Sun since October 2017.

A solar flare is a flash of radiation from sunspots, cooler patches on the Sun's surface.

Nasa has also observed more of these sunspots and thinks the giant star could be about to enter a new cycle.

The Sun actually has an 11 year cycle and increased activity hints it could be moving towards a more active stage.

However, the strong solar flare spotted recently posed no threat to Earth and wasn't heading in our direction.

Nasa said the flare was also not strong enough to alert scientists at the Space Weather Prediction Center.

We've had a few months of very little solar activity so astronomers have been keeping their eye on the Sun to see what happens next.

Nasa says we won't know whether the new sunspots indicate increased activity for a many more months.

The space agency said: ""It takes at least six months of solar observations and sunspot-counting after a minimum to know when it's occurred.

""Because that minimum is defined by the lowest number of sunspots in a cycle, scientists need to see the numbers consistently rising before they can determine when exactly they were at the bottom.""

It can take 12 months to confirm minimum solar activity, by which point the Sun should be out of that part of the cycle.

The Sun's 11 year cycle sees activity and sunspots rise and fall in number.

The latest solar flares, detected on May 29, were categorised as as M-class solar flares.

This means they came from new sunspots.

The M also stands for 'medium' as all solar flares are classified into A, B, C, M or X categories, depending on how powerful they are.

If an M-class solar flare was to impact Earth it could cause blackouts across the polar regions and small radiation storms.

In other space news, the highest-ever resolution photos of the Sun were published online earlier this year.

A SpaceX rocket launched two US astronauts into orbit over the weekend.

1066,"“Josie and the Pussycats” is a “girl band movie” aimed at children and young adolescents, especially young girls. At first glance, the flick seems to be one of those generic, God-awful teen movies. However, a closer look reveals how its overall tone and message are in sharp contrast to stereotypes of the genre. “Josie and the Pussycats” is indeed an acerbic critique of a morally bankrupt music industry. The most surprising thing about this 2001 movie is its frighteningly accurate predictions regarding today’s pop music and its Illuminati agenda: mind controlled artists, hypnotized masses, subliminal messages… it’s all there. This article will examine the movie’s themes and their relation to today’s music business context.



Josie and the Pussycats was released in 2001 by Universal. In music industry terms, 2001 is ancient history. Just to put you back in the context of the era: N’Sync were still singing Bye Bye Bye, Cisco wanted to see your thong and everybody was wondering Who Let the Dogs Out. Teens were going crazy for boy bands like the Backstreet Boys and everybody was dancing to Ja Rule. So, yes, it was a long time ago.

Josie and the Pussycats came out during that period, but it seems to foretell the death of the era. The movie starts with members of the boy band “Du Jour,” a spoof on the Backstreet Boys, dying in a forced plane crash. The group is then replaced by a girl band with a semi-punky attitude and non-threatening pop rock music. This pretty much reflects what actually happened in the years following the release of this movie: N’Sync and the Backstreet Boys disappeared from the preteen music market and were replaced by Miley Cyrus, Hilary Duff, the Jonas Brothers, and so on.

Despite the movie’s apparent lightheartedness, it displays a harsh and sustained judgment of the music business. It is also severely critical of the state of America’s youth. Teens and preteens are constantly depicted as a herd of brainless drones who are incapable of independent thinking and prone to hysteria.

But behind the usual “OMG these big corporations are so corporation-y” criticism, Josie and the Pussycats tackles, in an odd and humorous way, some of the darker sides of the music industry. These include the mind control of the masses and entertainers and even the assassination of artists who rebel or ask too many questions.

The Boy Band That Knew Too Much

As stated above, the movie starts with Du Jour (the boy band “of the day”) enjoying their enormous success. In their private jet, the vain and half-witted group of singers complain about petty things to their record executive Wyatt, who acts more like a legal guardian. Or, in mind control terms, a handler.

The band then asks Wyatt about strange sounds they heard in the acapella tracks of their latest song… and they want some answers.

Wyatt’s answer is quite extreme: He straps on a parachute and jumps off the plane, leaving Du Jour to die in what media will refer to an “accidental” plane crash. This has actually happened in reality numerous times. Artists who start uncovering the darker side of the entertainment business, who ask too many questions, or worse, who plan to reveal these things to the public, are often dropped, publicly humiliated and scorned. And, as in Du Jour’s case, they are also sometimes killed for displaying such behavior.

Du Jour was signed with the world’s biggest record label, Mega Records. We soon learn that the company is much more than a record label.

Mega Records is, in fact, “in business” with the American government and the FBI to brainwash the “most influential demographic in the entire population”: the youth. While giving a tour of the label’s headquarters to visitors from foreign countries (who are there to learn how it’s done), Fiona, the eccentric CEO of Mega Records, has this to say:

Fiona’s office then turns into an elevator and starts descending into a secret underground facility.

The label’s headquarters is, in fact, a control center for manipulating the minds of the American youth. It creates new fads, decides everything from “what clothes are in style to what slang is in vogue,” with the ultimate goal of making the youth continually spend money on one temporary trend after another.

Reality is, of course, more complex than that. Trends are (probably) not created in an underground control center in New York City. There is, however, truth in this near-cartoonish depiction of the music business. The entertainment industry is indeed connected to “higher powers” (as personified in the movie by the FBI agent) in order to sell the youth on the economic elite’s agenda. Popular culture not only attempts to sell products and brands to the audience but also ideas, values, and attitudes. In previous articles on the Vigilant Citizen, we have established that today’s agenda focuses on concepts such as transhumanism, Illuminati symbolism, premature sexualization, police state/militarization, and so forth.

Fiona then explains that her label inserts subliminal messages in pop music in order to manipulate the youth into buying products and ideas. The label thus goes beyond the simple advertising of products. It conceals hidden messages in the music that bypass the audience’s conscious minds in order to directly reach their subconscious.

After the presentation, a foreigner asks Fiona “How can you control the rock bands? What if one of them discovers you are placing hidden messages in their music?” This is what she answers:

There are numerous real-life examples of celebrities who have been silenced, one of the most shocking and evident being Michael Jackson. After decades of being controlled by the entertainment business, he attempted to break free in the late 90s. He even spoke out about it. He then endured years of scandals, trials, public ridicule and financial difficulties. Michael Jackson still managed to keep singing and dancing, even organizing a world tour for 2010. Since previous attempts to destroy him failed, MJ got silenced… by force. So, it would seem that ten years after the release of this movie, shady celebrity sacrifices are still happening.

In an attempt to “take things to the next level,” Mega Records develops a new technology called “3DX Surround Sound.” This new technology “makes the music feel like it is happening all around you.” All the kids who attend Josie and the Pussycat concerts or watch them on TV have to purchase this headgear in order to hear the music.

Back in real life, we are seeing the commercialization of a very similar technology…

Josie and the Pussycats: From Nobodies to Sex Kittens Programming Stars

After the killing of Du Jour, record exec Wyatt is instructed to find a new band as soon as possible. The movie makes it clear that talent is absolutely irrelevant. The label just needs a good-looking group and it will take care of the rest. Then we are introduced to The Pussycats… and their lack of fans.

The rock band comprises three young ladies who wear leopard ears as a prop. It is quite obvious that nobody wants to hear their music and even their manager Alexander doesn’t seem to like it.

After hearing about Du Jour’s plane crash on television, The Pussycats leader, Josie, is motivated to “get out there” and obtain a record contract. At the same time, Wyatt is driving around in the small town of Riverdale, looking for a band to sign. Then it happens.

Wyatt sits down with the girls and tells them how happy he is “to be sitting down with The Pussyhats.” He obviously knows nothing about the band and does not care. He then offers them a record contract with Mega Records. Josie wonders briefly why her band is being offered a contract by a label that did not even hear them play. However, her hunger for fame dispels all her doubts and the band signs the contract.

The Pussycats’ story is classic: A broke, struggling band attempts to become big by performing gigs; a record label offers a shady contract; the desperate and fame-hungry band signs, not knowing what they are getting into. For the band, it’s either taking a chance and signing the contract or going back to eating Ramen noodles in a crappy apartment. So, they sign the contract.

Right after they sign, the label subjects the group to a complete metamorphosis: a make-over to “sexy them up,” and a name change, from The Pussycats to Josie and the Pussycats. The group is now completely owned by the label. It has lost control of its image, its name, and even its music, as it has been modified to contain subliminal messages. But those changes pay off, as they become a #1 band in less than a week.

The movie also contains numerous references to mind control programming. As stated in previous articles, numerous celebrities have been subjected to mind control in order for them to become more easily manageable by their handlers. In bolder words, they become slaves of the industry.

Monarch mind control includes numerous types of programming, one of them being Beta (or Sex Kitten programming). It is the type of programming that is the most used in the entertainment industry and it is coded with references to “cats,” “kitties,” “pussycats,” and also with the wearing of feline print clothing. This might explain why the producers chose to base the girl band on the Archie Comic of the same name. The symbolism was just too perfect.

So, in less than a week, with the help of subliminal messaging, the group produces a #1 hit and sells out a huge concert. The group even earns the honor of meeting the label’s CEO, Fiona.

The girls soon realize that Fiona acts in a strange, dissociative matter as if she were herself under some sort of mind control.

After the meeting, Fiona spies on the group using hidden cameras and learns that two members of the group, Melody, and Valerie, are creeped out by her and flat-out do not trust her. So she decides to go with another tactic we often see in the music business: to keep the star of the group and drop the other band members.

In order to carry out this operation, the label proceeds to use mind control on Josie by making her listen to subliminal messages in her own music. The process completely changes her attitude and personality: Josie turns from a sweet and down-to-earth girl into an attention-hungry diva who is convinced that her friends are worthless. This scene subtly describes the hidden, mind control aspect that happens in the music business: label execs use mind control programming to create an alter persona in Josie, which they can control and manage at will.

Fortunately, Josie manages to snap out of her hypnotic state and learns everything about the 3D, mass mind control concert. Unfortunately, her bandmates Melody and Valerie have been kidnapped by the label and Josie must perform in the mind control concert to avoid the “accidental killing” of her friends.

I will spare you the details of the ending, but I can tell you that it involves catfights and the girls playing generic pop rock in front of a crowd that has learned to think for itself. Thank you, Josie!

The least we can say is that Josie and the Pussycats is an odd movie. It strongly criticizes some aspects of the entertainment business while perpetuating more of the same. One example of this paradoxical situation is the ridiculous amount of product placements in the movie.

Some of those placements are pretty hilarious (see the box of Tide above), but in the end, they too perpetuate the market ideology. Imagine me repeatedly punching someone in the face. Then when asked to stop, imagine me replying: “Can’t you see that I’m pushing this face punching to an absurd level? You’re obviously not getting the brilliant second-degree message here, I’m actually denouncing violence! So sit there and think about violence in society while I keep pounding this guy’s face.” Despite what is being said, the fact remains that pounding someone in the face is itself perpetuating violence… and this movie keeps punching the viewers in the face with product placements.

In fact, the entire movie’s message gives the same odd feeling. Its clever “behind-the-scenes” look at the music industry makes the viewers feel they’re “in on the joke,” making them comfortable enough to let their guard down. However, at the end of the day, the young viewers are still the butt of the joke: all of the sleazy and gimmicky tactics are being used on real-life viewers in order to sell them mind controlling music. Furthermore, the movie fictionalizes some of the darker aspects of the entertainment business, for example by making mind controlled artists something that one can “only see in the movies.”

At the end of the film, Mega Records’ mass hypnosis plans are uncovered, and the FBI (who funded the project) immediately attempts to dissociate from the label, even arresting Fiona “on charges of conspiracy against the youth of America.” The agent then privately says to Fiona: “We were shutting down your entire project anyways… we found out that subliminal messages work much better in movies!” This is the movie’s way of saying that even though it has let you in on the joke, the movie is still part of the plans. In other words, the biggest joke in the movie… is you.",conspiracy,C0106b,flat.earth; michael.jackson.death
602,"B.o.B Insists the World Is Flat: 'There's No Way You Can See All the Evidence and Not Know'

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars … oh, and also that the world is flat?

On Sunday night and Monday morning, hip hop artist B.o.B took to Twitter to express his views regarding the shape of the Earth – he says it’s flat – and the vast #NASA cover-up that has tricked millions into believe that the Earth is round.

“Don’t believe what I say, research what I say,” the “Airplanes” rapper tweeted, after facing an almost immediate backlash. “You can regurgitate force fed information all day … still doesn’t change physics.”

B.o.B. tweeted about his position for hours. His biggest piece of evidence? His personal experience on an airplane, when he witnessed the Red Bull jump happening five miles away.

634,"YouTube has announced that it will no longer recommend videos that ""come close to"" violating its community guidelines, such as conspiracy or medically inaccurate videos.

On Saturday, a former engineer for Google, YouTube's parent company, hailed the move as a ""historic victory.""

The original blog post from YouTube, published on Jan. 25, said that videos the site recommends, usually after a user has viewed one video, would no longer lead just to similar videos and instead would ""pull in recommendations from a wider set of topics.""

For example, if one person watches one video showing the recipe for snickerdoodles, they may be bombarded with suggestions for other cookie recipe videos. Up until the change, the same scenario would apply to conspiracy videos.

YouTube said in the post that the action is meant to ""reduce the spread of content that comes close to — but doesn't quite cross the line of — violating"" its community policies. The examples the company cited include ""promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11.""

The change will not affect the videos' availability. And if users are subscribed to a channel that, for instance, produces conspiracy content, or if they search for it, they will still see related recommendations, the company wrote.

Guillaume Chaslot, a former Google engineer, said that he helped to build the artificial intelligence used to curate recommended videos. In a thread of tweets posted on Saturday, he praised the change.

""It's only the beginning of a more humane technology. Technology that empowers all of us, instead of deceiving the most vulnerable,"" Chaslot wrote.

Chaslot described how, prior to the change, a user watching conspiracy theory videos was led down a rabbit hole of similar content, which was the intention of the AI he said he helped build.

According to Chaslot, the goal of YouTube's AI was to keep users on the site as long as possible in order to promote more advertisements. When a user was enticed by multiple conspiracy videos, the AI not only became biased by the content the hyper-engaged users were watching, it also kept track of the content that those users were engaging with in an attempt to reproduce that pattern with other users, Chaslot explained.

He pointed to a different artificial intelligence that was also shaped by the bias of its users: Microsoft's chatbot ""Tay.""

Tay was a Twitter chatbot produced by Microsoft, which was meant to interact with users like a human and learn from others.

Within 24 hours of its release, Tay went from innocent chatbot to full-blown misogynist and racist, according to The Verge. The AI operating Tay learned from and became biased by the engagement it received from Twitter users who were spamming the bot with those ideologies, according to CNBC.

Chaslot said that YouTube's fix to its recommendations AI will have to include getting people to videos with truthful information and overhauling the current system it uses to recommend videos.

""The AI change will have a huge impact because affected channels have billions of views, overwhelmingly coming from recommendations,"" Chaslot said, adding that the platform's decision to make this change affect thousands of new users.

YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Chaslot's thread.",mainstream,M08e45,flat.earth

1040,"Toward the end of the 14th century A.D., a handful of Italian thinkers declared that they were living in a new age. The barbarous, unenlightened “Middle Ages” were over, they said; the new age would be a “rinascità” (“rebirth”) of learning and literature, art and culture. This was the birth of the period now known as the Renaissance. For centuries, scholars have agreed that the Italian Renaissance (another word for “rebirth”) happened just that way: that between the 14th century and the 17th century, a new, modern way of thinking about the world and man’s place in it replaced an old, backward one. In fact, the Renaissance (in Italy and in other parts of Europe) was considerably more complicated than that: For one thing, in many ways the period we call the Renaissance was not so different from the era that preceded it. However, many of the scientific, artistic and cultural achievements of the so-called Renaissance do share common themes, most notably the humanistic belief that man was the center of his own universe.

Fifteenth-century Italy was unlike any other place in Europe. It was divided into independent city-states, each with a different form of government. Florence, where the Italian Renaissance began, was an independent republic. It was also a banking and commercial capital and, after London and Constantinople, the third-largest city in Europe. Wealthy Florentines flaunted their money and power by becoming patrons, or supporters, of artists and intellectuals. In this way, the city became the cultural center of Europe and of the Renaissance.

The New Humanism: Cornerstone of the Renaissance

Thanks to the patronage of these wealthy elites, Renaissance-era writers and thinkers were able to spend their days doing just that. Instead of devoting themselves to ordinary jobs or to the asceticism of the monastery, they could enjoy worldly pleasures. They traveled around Italy, studying ancient ruins and rediscovering Greek and Roman texts.

To Renaissance scholars and philosophers, these classical sources from Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome held great wisdom. Their secularism, their appreciation of physical beauty and especially their emphasis on man’s achievements and expression formed the governing intellectual principle of the Italian Renaissance. This philosophy is known as “humanism.”

Humanism encouraged people to be curious and to question received wisdom (particularly that of the medieval Church). It also encouraged people to use experimentation and observation to solve earthly problems. As a result, many Renaissance intellectuals focused on trying to define and understand the laws of nature and the physical world. For example, Renaissance artist Leonardo Da Vinci created detailed scientific “studies” of objects ranging from flying machines to submarines. He also created pioneering studies of human anatomy. Likewise, the scientist and mathematician Galileo Galilei investigated one natural law after another. By dropping different-sized cannonballs from the top of a building, for instance, he proved that all objects fall at the same rate of acceleration. He also built a powerful telescope and used it to show that the Earth and other planets revolved around the sun and not, as religious authorities argued, the other way around. (For this, Galileo was arrested for heresy and threatened with torture and death, but he refused to recant: “I do not believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use,” he said.)

However, perhaps the most important technological development of the Renaissance happened not in Italy but in Germany, where Johannes Gutenberg invented the mechanical movable-type printing press in the middle of the 15th century. For the first time, it was possible to make books–and, by extension, knowledge–widely available.

Michelangelo’s “David.” Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper.” Sandro Boticelli’s “The Birth of Venus.” During the Italian Renaissance, art was everywhere (just look up at Michelangelo’s “The Last Judgment” painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel!). Patrons such as Florence’s Medici family sponsored projects large and small, and successful artists became celebrities in their own right.

Renaissance artists and architects applied many humanist principles to their work. For example, the architect Filippo Brunelleschi applied the elements of classical Roman architecture–shapes, columns and especially proportion–to his own buildings. The magnificent eight-sided dome he built at the Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral in Florence was an engineering triumph–it was 144 feet across, weighed 37,000 tons and had no buttresses to hold it up–as well as an aesthetic one.

Brunelleschi also devised a way to draw and paint using linear perspective. That is, he figured out how to paint from the perspective of the person looking at the painting, so that space would appear to recede into the frame. After the architect Leon Battista Alberti explained the principles behind linear perspective in his treatise “Della Pittura” (“On Painting”), it became one of the most noteworthy elements of almost all Renaissance painting. Later, many painters began to use a technique called chiaroscuro to create an illusion of three-dimensional space on a flat canvas.

Fra Angelico, the painter of frescoes in the church and friary of San Marco in Florence, was called “a rare and perfect talent” by the Italian painter and architect Vasari in his “Lives of The Artists.” Renaissance painters like Raphael, Titian and Giotto and Renaissance sculptors like Donatello and Lorenzo Ghiberti created art that would inspire generations of future artists.

The End of the Italian Renaissance

By the end of the 15th century, Italy was being torn apart by one war after another. The kings of England, France and Spain, along with the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor, battled for control of the wealthy peninsula. At the same time, the Catholic Church, which was itself wracked with scandal and corruption, had begun a violent crackdown on dissenters. In 1545, the Council of Trent officially established the Roman Inquisition. In this climate, humanism was akin to heresy. The Italian Renaissance was over.",mainstream,M1380f,flat.earth

244,"We employed the OsiriX freeware (Pixmeo SARL, Bernex, Switzerland) image-viewing platform to generate a standardised method of producing curved reconstructions of the paediatric brain.

MRI scans of 10 children with known cortical atrophy caused by hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy sustained during term delivery were selected alongside 8 age-matched controls who had normal MRI findings. The research was approved by the University of Bristol Ethics Committee (case reference 27741) and has been performed in accordance with the ethics standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.

We selected data from T1-weighted 3-D turbo spin-echo or 3-D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. Using the 3-D curved MPR function in OsiriX, multiple curved reformatting techniques were tested, then formalised and standardised. We performed reconstructions from all three planes (coronal, sagittal and axial) using different landmark slices (e.g., foramen of Monro, pineal gland), angles of reconstruction (e.g., following the course of the Sylvian fissure, central sulcus) and at various depths to the cortical surface.

Two images (one reconstructed from the coronal plane and one from the sagittal plane) were determined to give the best overview of the cortical regions most frequently damaged in hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy sustained at term delivery (i.e. the watershed zones, and perisylvian and perirolandic regions). We describe an optimal method for creating these reconstructions.

For reconstructions from the coronal 3-D T1-weighted data set, the slice demonstrating the foramina of Monro is selected for generating the flat-earth map. The pathway for generating the curved reconstructions is plotted 1-cm deep to the surface of the brain by depositing cursors at 12 landmarks (6 on either side of the midline) as described in Fig. 1. The resultant image has been likened to a Mercator map of the earth [3, 4].

For reconstructions from the sagittal 3-D T1-weighted data, the landmark midline slice demonstrating the aqueduct of Sylvius is selected. The pathway for generating the curved reconstructions is plotted 1-cm deep to the cortical surface by depositing cursors at 8 points starting anteriorly and ending posteriorly as described in Fig. 1. The resultant image derived from sagittal images is likened to unrolling a scroll.

The cerebral sulcal anatomy of children in the control group from the Mercator brain maps was identified using work by Wagner et al. [4]. No equivalent anatomical work exists for scroll brain maps, and the sulcal anatomy was identified de novo from an online anatomy atlas [5]. The sulcal anatomy and expected regions of abnormality were then plotted on the Mercator and scroll maps in one of the control patients as a reference source (Fig. 2).

Flat-earth maps (Mercator and scroll projections) of the brain were then generated for 10 children with previous hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy. These were displayed alongside those of age-matched healthy controls for comparison. Two readers (S.A., a paediatric radiologist with 15 years’ experience in neuroimaging, and E.S., a 5th-year radiology trainee) assessed each flat-earth map for the presence of (1) widening of the Sylvian fissure; (2) widening of the longitudinal fissure, noting whether such widening was localised (indicating regional watershed-zone, or perisylvian or perirolandic volume loss) or generalised; (3) cortical atrophy in characteristic locations (perirolandic, perisylvian or watershed distribution), and (4) ulegyria. Discrepancies were arbitrated by a third reader (A.C., a qualified general radiologist 3 years post completion of training).

No abnormal features were identified on any of the eight controls (mean age 3 years 11 months; 5 boys, 3 girls). The abnormal findings that were visible in children with hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy sustained at term delivery (mean age 3 years 6 months; 6 boys, 4 girls) are shown in Table 1.

The flat-earth map generated by the curved reconstruction displays the structures along a region adjacent to the plotted path at the expense of structures at the extremes of the axis perpendicular to that path; two maps are generated from perpendicular curved lines, so different structures are seen optimally on each map. The following general observations were made:
• The perisylvian and perirolandic regions were better demonstrated on the Mercator maps. The scroll maps demonstrated the lateral structures poorly.
• More of the frontal lobe anatomy was seen consistently on the Mercator maps.
• The central posterior parietal and occipital lobes were better demonstrated on the scroll maps.
• Watershed zones were well demonstrated on both Mercator and scroll maps.

The following observations were made from review of flat-earth maps in children who sustained hypoxic–ischaemic injury at term delivery:
• Widening of the longitudinal fissure was seen on all abnormal cases on Mercator and scroll maps, consistent with parasagittal/parafalcine watershed atrophy. In 9 of 10 instances there was a localised biconvex separation of the hemispheres distinct from the parallel separation of the hemispheres elsewhere (Figs. 3 and 4).
• Damage to intervascular watershed zones was well seen on both Mercator and scroll maps (anterior watershed zones were better demonstrated on Mercator map and posterior watershed regions on the scroll maps) and was noted in a continuous band-like fashion (as opposed to a wedge of abnormality) (Fig. 4).
• Perirolandic and perisylvian damage was better demonstrated on Mercator maps (Figs. 3 and 4).
• Ulegyria was identified in 7 of 10 of cases of hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy (Figs. 3 and 4, Table 1).",mainstream,M16937,flat.earth
1316,"THE protion of the earth's surface bounded by the horizon which one is able to take in at one view, is but seldom a regular plane; more generally heights and depressions, mountains and valleys, alternate with each other so irregularly, that at first nothing seems farther from reality than the idea of a regular form of the earth's surface. But the more our point of view overtops the mountains which lie within the horizon, the further obviously will our range of view extend, and all the mountains and valleys which give so irregular a form to the horizon of the plain will, under this condition, become imperceptible and unimportant. Indeed, one can easily conceive that if the eye were able to comprehend at one time a much greater portion of the surface, the irregularities of the plain caused by the mountains and valleys would appear exceedingly small in comparison with the extent of surface. But such considerations must also have occurred to the ancients; for the earliest conception among the Greeks of the form of the earth's surface was that of a flat disc surrounded by the river Okeanos, into which the sun plunged nightly. The first advance was made by Thales, who said the earth must have a point of support, and Imagined it was borne by the water. Anaximenes supposed that a strong dense atmosphere supported the earth. Quite another idea prevailed in India, where the earth was believed to be borne on the back of an elephant. More correct views of the figure of the earth prevailed, at an earlier period in other parts of the East, in Egypt and a part of Asia. The Egyptians and Chaldeans taught at the earliest period the spherical form of the earth, and Pythagoras appears to have adopted this idea from them.",mainstream,M151e5,flat.earth

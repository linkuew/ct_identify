Hiding deep in DT forest MD be your modus operandi , Bigfoot , but Hollywood and Madison Avenue are pushing PRP -- however reluctantly -- into DT spotlight . A slew of documentary , TV and film projects including Animal NNP ’s current hit “ Finding Bigfoot , ” and a Sasquatch film trilogy from “ Blair Witch Project ” director Eduardo Sanchez are poised to VB past DT old grainy images of yesterday and give DT hairy 800 - pound biped a high - def close - up . “ EX ’s been a real upswing in scholarly interest along with this huge undercurrent of popularity among DT general NN , ” VBD Jeffrey Meldrum , DT Idaho NNP anatomy and anthropology professor and primates expert who wrote “ Sasquatch : Legend Meets NNP ” as a companion to a Discovery Channel special of DT same name . “ EX ’s something about DT human psyche WDT really connects with this icon . ” Campfire stories , eyewitness reports and grainy videos have kept DT legend alive for decades in DT U.S. and worldwide . ( DT mythology goes back much further if PRP take cave drawings into account . ) And Bigfoot has been a pop culture fixture since DT 1950s , popping up in movies , commercials and as a guest on ‘ 70s TV hits IN “ DT Six Million Dollar Man ” and “ DT Bionic Woman . ” Each NN EX ’s a JJ development -- such as evidence of a yeti allegedly uncovered in Russia last fall or a Bigfoot body purportedly discovered in Georgia , both of which turned out to be fake -- EX ’s a spike in online searches , blog posts , NN reports and , inevitably , Bigfoot - centric entertainment . “ Blair Witch ’s ” Sanchez is working on a Bigfoot - based horror movie , DT first of a planned trilogy , and a group of Bigfoot enthusiasts is putting together a documentary called “ Sasquatch : DT Quest . ” Meldrum , along with launching an online scholarly journal , is producing an Internet TV project and considering an expanded version of “ Legend Meets NNP . ” “ PRP all VBP to believe IN EX are still monsters lurking in DT secret corners of DT NN , and DT ’s DT allure of Bigfoot , ” VBD Marjorie Kaplan , NN of Animal NNP , home to DT hit series “ Finding Bigfoot . “ PRP ’s fun to be reminded IN PRP do n’t VB everything . ” “ Finding Bigfoot ” follows four eccentric field researchers who travel to towns where EX have been sightings , gather stories from DT locals and set out on their own expeditions . DT colorful characters have coined “ squatch ” as a term of endearment and say things IN “ PRP ’s really squatchy out here , ” to describe remote areas PRP VBP are harboring Bigfoots . DT series , which attracted 1.6 million viewers for its second season premiere , will launch its third season this summer . “ If anybody ’s VBG to find him , PRP ’s VBG to be PRP , ” Kaplan declared , adding with a laugh , “ hopefully after 100 episodes . ” In coming months , cable TV will be overrun with Sasquatch programming . Syfy thriller “ Bigfoot ” promises a “ big and nasty , teeth and claws ” star nestled in a kitschy popcorn flick , according to Thomas Vitale , DT network ’s executive vice NN of programming . Airing this summer , DT Saturday night movie pits former child stars Barry Williams and Danny Bonaduce against each other in a search for DT larger - than - life biped at a rural music festival . PRP fits strategically with DT network ’s tradition of over - DT - top original action movies IN “ Sharktopus ” and “ Piranhaconda . ” “ Bigfoot is a classic trope of DT creature feature , ” Vitale VBD . “ PRP ’s a story WDT spans a lot of cultures ... and PRP ’s ripe for reinvention . ” TV has been doing exactly DT by using Bigfoot in purely fictional , and sometimes goofy , ways in series such as Disney Channel ’s “ Phineas and Ferb ” and Nickelodeon ’s “ iCarly , ” not to mention frequent reruns of DT ‘ 80s family comedy film “ Harry and DT Hendersons . ” In “ iBelieve in Bigfoot , ” DT “ iCarly ” kids head into DT woods looking for DT creature in what executive producer Dan Schneider VBD is CD of DT series ’ most popular episodes to date . DT youngsters never actually see Bigfoot , but PRP hear a menacing growl as PRP see their RV drive away , leaving them stranded . “ DT implication is IN Bigfoot ’s real , and he ’s RB a car thief , ” Schneider VBD . PRP ’s a kid- relevant subject because “ every generation discovers DT Bigfoot legend , sort of IN discovering DT Beatles , ” VBD Dan Povenmire , CD of DT creators of DT animated “ Phineas and Ferb . ” He and partner Jeff “ Swampy ” Marsh wrote an episode called “ VB DT Bigfoot Outta My Face , ” WDT sprang from their own childhood memories of hearing scary stories and seeing DT famous 1967 Patterson footage of a purported Bigfoot in Northern California . Even commercials have fun using Bigfoot as a punch line : A current ad for Stride Whitemint gum stars Olympic medalist Shaun White and a yeti who socks a guy in DT gut so he ’ll spit out his long - lasting chewing gum and replace PRP with another . At DT more serious end of DT spectrum are interview - based docu-style shows such as History ’s “ Bigfoot : DT Definitive Guide , ” National Geographic ’s “ Is PRP Real ? ” and Syfy ’s “ Destination Truth . ” Travel Channel ’s “ Legends of DT Ozarks ” and “ Bigfootville ” will poke around in isolated areas for Bigfoot evidence in episodes airing in late March . Cliff Barackman , an elementary school teacher and cast member on “ Finding Bigfoot , ” VBD a TV series dedicated to Sasquatch hunting was “ long overdue . ” “ When EX are multiple shows about cakes and ghosts , why not a show about Bigfoot ? ” Barackman VBD . “ Our show reinforces DT fact IN PRP ’re looking for a species , not an individual , and IN PRP ’re trying to help NNS understand what a Bigfoot might actually be . ”"

Jerome Boateng is DT only player who will have to miss Bayern 's trip to London due to injury as he continues to recover from a shoulder problem . Philipp Lahm will have to sit out too after picking up his third yellow card in DT Champions League this season .

DT Gunners certainly have an uphill road to climb as PRP seek to turn DT tables on Bayern , who have qualified for DT Champions League semifinals in each of DT last five seasons . Assuming IN PRP fail in their comeback attempt on Tuesday , PRP will be DT seventh straight season in which Arsenal has been eliminated in DT round of 16 .

He received a lot of criticism after leaving Alexis Sanchez - who with 17 goals is DT team 's leading scorer in DT Premier League - out of DT team in their 3 - 1 loss to Liverpool on Saturday . Sanchez , who scored Arsenal 's only goal from DT penalty spot in DT first leg , MD be CD of DT key players for DT North London side in their comeback attempt . However , Wenger will not have Mesut Özil at his disposal , after DT manager told Monday 's press conference IN DT German internatonal will be forced to sit this NN out due to an illness ."

By SERGE BIELANKO | December 3rd , 2012 at 4:23 pm NNS who do n’t believe in Santa Claus are starting to piss me off . I mean , what gives , PRP guys ?

I do n’t VB DT whole ‘ skeptical ’ thing here . What exactly is so hard to fathom about deer WDT fly anyway ? And what ? PRP VBP elves are something someone just happened to make up ?

Just when PRP MD use a friend IN old Saint Nick to help guide PRP through DT Age of Zits and DT Prama™ ( Prom Drama ) NNS , PRP turn around and thank him for his long dedication to our boundless joy by informing him IN he is nothing but a bunch of bull . Anyhow , I have to try and stem DT tide here this NN ; I ’ve got to do my part to try and bring at least a few of PRP back into DT righteous fold of Kringleism ( DT unfettered belief in magical things ) . See , as CD of DT few remaining adult believers ( and RB as former Vice - NNP of DT Unofficial Santa Claus Fan Club , Southeastern Pennsylvania Chapter # 828 from 2002 - 2003 ) , I should VB IN I ’ve been privy to a wee bit more of DT truth about who Santa really is than most of PRP .

Read DT truth here today and then decided for yourselves ! PRP wanted DT proof and I ’ve got PRP . Santa Claus is real : always was , always will be . Most of PRP agree IN department stores and DT UH all hire ‘ Elves ’ to play DT role of Santa in DT month leading up to Christmas . But recent revelations in Santa Believer Circles highlight this special photo from DT Sears store in Duluth , MN 1964 . In PRP , Mary and Bobby Richards stare into DT eyes of what is largely believed to be DT REAL Santa Claus in CD of his very rare store appearances captured on film ! Why do PRP VB this ? Because Bobby , now a respected brat salesman in Sheboygan , WI swears PRP . Image : flickr.com/photos/kingprince Few details are clear about Santa Claus ’s youth . However , in 1993 , at a yard sale in suburban Reykjavik , Iceland , a woman bought a shoebox full of pictures WDT contained this stunning find . In PRP , what appears to be a very young Santa Claus darts through a room with swiftness . Experts all agree IN DT distinct scoobyish hat he is wearing is found only in distinct pockets of DT North Pole , giving further proof IN DT boy in DT picture really is a very young Santa Claus !"

Far more companies are hiring seasonal staff this NN than last , with JJ research from CareerBuilder showing IN 41 percent of employers plan to hire summer workers , up from 29 percent in 2016 . So , PRP should n’t be too difficult to find a job and help pay down DT looming college debt or give back to your folks . But wait — DT ’s not quite how things work anymore . DT summer job , once an obligation , is now merely an option among a few possible routes . "" DT summer job is disappearing , and has been over DT last 30 NNS , ” VBD Marc Prosser , co-founder and publisher of FitSmallBusiness.com . An analysis from DT Bureau of Labor Statistics showed IN as of July 2016 , DT teen labor force participation rate was 43.2 percent , down nearly 30 percentage points from its peak of 71.8 percent in July 1978 . EX are a number of factors contributing to this decline , but most prominent among them is DT increasing popularity of internships . “ JJ more students are seeking out internships or research opportunities over DT summer now , as opposed to when I first started counseling students [ nearly 20 NNS ago ] , "" VBD Dr. Kat Cohen , CEO and founder of IvyWise , an admissions counseling services company . “ Everything is more competitive these days , so getting hands - on work experience or hands - on research experience , and making contacts at companies WDT students might VB to work at post - graduation can be a smart move . ” PRP ’s becoming more common for college students to balance unpaid internships with a paying side gig for a company IN Uber or Instacart . “ While big cities typically provide more internship opportunities , JJ on - demand jobs are now available on college campuses as well as big cities , ” VBD Brandon Yahn , founder of Student Loans Guy . “ This allows students to take research jobs on campus as internships while still making money . ” “ PRP see a surge in dog walker applications from college students and even school teachers who find themselves with an abundance of NN for DT summer months , ” VBD Dave Comiskey , co-founder of Barkly Pets . “ DT job provides NN outside , rewarding NN spent with adorable pets , and offers more freedom and flexibility than other summer jobs MD . ” And DT pay is impressive : an average of $ 18 per half - hour walk . But more than good pay , PRP appears young NNS VBP good hours . Or , more specifically : DT ability to choose them on a whim . Related : Seven Ways Millennials Are Changing DT Workplace for DT Better "" Flexibility in shifts and schedules is super attractive to this [ younger ] workforce , "" VBD Peter Harrison , CEO of DT job search engine website Snagajob . “ Whole Foods is losing money to Instacart — which pays less and provides fewer benefits and security — all because DT workers prize DT flexibility . ” Some employers feel IN teenagers are turning their nose up at their recruiting efforts , opting instead for something easier , even if PRP pays less . Jared Beckstead , marketing coordinator for Bailey 's Moving and Storage , says IN his company is desperate for workers during DT summer — DT business ’ busiest NN of NN — and is keen on hiring teens and college kids . Unfortunately , PRP ’s “ almost impossible to find students willing to do DT work , ” Beckstead told NBC NNP . “ I MD argue IN DT need for summer help at JJ businesses is alive and well ; DT disappearing act has been DT work ethic of today ’s youth , ” Beckstead VBD , adding IN teenage job candidates typically are "" willing to work for less money and fewer hours just because DT job is easier . "" Snagajob ’s Harrison says he hears this sentiment loud and clear from a variety of companies . “ All of our companies who do seasonal hires , especially in places IN Martha 's Vineyard , are having a fantastically hard NN filling jobs , ” Harrison VBD . JJ teens have DT luxury of chasing DT dream internship , even if PRP does n’t pay — or of hustling with an on - demand gig WDT gives them freedom . Others MD choose to forego work altogether because , as Snagajob ’s Harrison points out , “ EX is a growing acceptance of insane student debt as part of DT college process — a restaurant job can only chip away at DT edges of PRP . ” But what about DT families who need paychecks coming in from all eligible members ? Or DT parents of teens living at home who simply VBP their kid to take whatever job she can VB if only to learn DT importance of good work ethic ? "" ​Most parents realize IN by coddling their kids and not exposing them to responsibility , both financial and otherwise , PRP are doing their kids a disservice , "" VBD Allison Farber Cheston , career expert and job search coach . "" Employers have no patience for young employees who focus most on what DT organization can do for them . I spend a lot of NN with millennials explaining DT importance of humility and hard work . ​ "" PRP ’s crucial to note IN while DT summer job is n’t what PRP used to be , PRP absolutely still exists and can be just as valuable as an internship down DT road . Related : Five Millennial Jobs WDT Parents Will Never Understand "" EX are a couple of fields where teens can VB paid from DT start and will acquire good carryover skills for real jobs , ” VBD Cheston . “ Those are sales and customer service : Both of those functions will take them out of their comfort zone and teach them how money is made or how to deal with difficult NNS — excellent skills for real life and work . ” Another classic summer job WDT can teach valuable skills ? Camp counseling . Some programs now combine pay and college credits . "" A college - aged person can work on accounting and payroll at a camp while earning college credits and getting paid , ” VBD Susie Lupert , executive director of DT American Camp Association of NY and NJ , adding IN PRP MD not be too late to find such a job in your area . “ EX are always a few last - minute dropouts or staff members who were n’t DT right fit , so hires do occur at this NN of NN for a few positions . ” Not only can more traditional jobs impress hiring managers or admissions counselors in DT future , some are affiliated with scholarship programs . DT Chick Evans Scholarship , for instance , has provided full college scholarships to over 11,000 high schoolers who ’ve worked as golf caddies in DT U.S and Canada . "" Currently , 935 Evans Scholars are enrolled at 20 universities , and more than 10,400 young men and women have graduated as Evans Scholars , ” VBD John Kaczkowski , NN and CEO of DT Western Golf Association and Evans Scholars Foundation . “ This NN , 270 students from across DT country and Canada were awarded DT Evans Scholarship [ which comprises ] a full , four - NN housing and tuition scholarship for teens . ” CD of DT requirements to qualify DT scholarship ? “ Outstanding character . ” And PRP all VBP what best builds DT .

DT NN RB has been controlling what users can see and do online for NNS . For those who value human rights , DT situation is getting worse at an accelerating pace . With DT help from certain high - tech giants , DT country promises to lead DT NN in becoming DT first actual Orwellian surveillance NN . In NNP 2010 , DT Communist Chinese NN issued its first white paper regarding what PRP called “ a crystallization of human wisdom ” – DT internet . DT white paper acknowledges DT usefulness and importance of advancing this digital NN and technology . PRP “ energetically advocates and actively supports DT development and application of DT Internet across DT country . ” DT white paper guarantees IN citizens will enjoy a free press and freedom of speech on DT internet : “ DT Chinese NN encourages and supports DT development of Internet NN communication undertakings , provides DT NN with a full range of NN , and at DT same NN guarantees DT citizens ’ freedom of speech on DT Internet as well as DT NN ’s right to VB , to participate , to be heard and to oversee in accordance with DT law . ” This is where DT white paper reveals DT “ gotcha ” clause : DT Chinese policy uses “ DT law ” to control online communications . Now PRP VBP IN this law is targeting DT very things DT white paper promised MD be given : unhindered access to NNP Wide Web NN and social NN internet sites for both residents and foreign users : “ DT Chinese NN will stick to DT basic principle of administering DT Internet in accordance with DT law , try to follow DT nature and law of development of DT Internet in DT light of DT national conditions , and promote DT scientific development of DT Internet with effective administration so as to contribute to DT development of DT Internet worldwide . ” In 2011 , NNP began requiring internet companies to sign a “ JJ Pledge of Self - Regulation and Professional Ethics for NNP Internet Industry ” which purported to regulate DT “ patriotic observance of law , equitableness , trustworthiness and honesty . ” Signers accused of violating DT NN - mandated pledge to uphold DT nation ’s laws MD be subject to review by DT Internet Society of NNP . If found guilty , such a company MD have PRP “ membership ” ( read : authorization to do business ) revoked . Since Xi Jinping became NNP ’s Communist Party leader in November of 2012 , NN censorship has flourished . In February 2016 , DT Chinese NN toured DT top three NN - run NN outlets . His message : PRP must swear absolute loyalty to DT Party and follow DT Party line in “ thought , politics , and action . ” Xi was completely candid about what DT online service companies were in business to do – serve DT NN by dishing out distorted information : “ DT NN run by DT party and DT NN are DT propaganda fronts and must have DT party as their family name . ” Xi told tech workers IN “ All DT work by DT party ’s NN must reflect DT party ’s will , safeguard DT party ’s authority , and safeguard DT party ’s unity . ” Freedom House published in its findings on “ Freedom on DT Net 2016 ” IN internet freedom “ around DT NN declined in 2016 for DT sixth consecutive NN ” with NNP leading DT way for DT second NN in a row . NNP Xi’s “ information security ” policy was proving effective in providing both surveillance and censorship . Another effect observed was an increase in self - policing while surfing DT net : “ Dozens of prosecutions related to online expression have increased self - censorship , as have legal restrictions introduced in 2015 . ” Since 2011 , DT Chinese NN - operated telecom company Tencent has been subsidizing and regulating DT nation ’s largest social NN site , called WeChat . With over a thousand million users – DT ’s CD billion as reckoned in American English – WeChat is a primary source for NN and views , just IN its American social NN counterparts Twitter and Facebook . Critics of WeChat say PRP promotes “ DT spread of sensationalist falsehoods . ” In June 2018 , a JJ WeChat in - app feature lets users validate NN items by consulting – guess who ? – WeChat employees ( or volunteers ) who perform DT fact - checking . CD very clever ploy over at WeChat is a “ Top Ten Rumors ” category . DT NN systematically debunks leading consumer education topics such as NN and safety , product recalls , and scams as fake NN . Here are two examples of NN - driven information control : • An article told NNS to stop using microwave ovens because microwaved food gives NNS cancer ( false ) . • Chinese currency can be scanned in DT app QQ to see if PRP are counterfeit ( RB false ) . WeChat even has a Google - IN “ WeChat rumor debunking assistant ” which 300,000 NNS consult daily . This is all well and good but observers point out IN Chinese online censors have DT power to delete any and all unsavory , anti-state , and illegal articles before anyone else can view them . This form of censorship pre-empts any fact - checking since EX are no facts to check . Weibo is an online service WDT has been called DT Chinese Twitter . DT micro-blogging platform enables DT NN to anticipate and counteract planned protests through monitoring all communications ( just IN DT NSA in DT NNP NNPS ) . Between Weibo snooping and WeChat censorship , a JJ generation of Chinese citizens is growing up ignorant of significant historical events WDT have been scrubbed from DT official narrative . Any private or group chat conversation WDT mentions Tiananmen Square , Tibet or DT Falun Gong ( a forbidden religious group ) is banned . DT user is not notified IN their message was never sent . An uneasy feeling is growing as PRP in DT west have watched NNP roll out its social credit score system , spy eyeglasses , and flocks – WDT is , fleets – of flying surveillance doves . NNP is racing ahead in DT technology game , all for DT sake of Communism and totalitarian statism . EX is evidence PRP hacked Hillary NNP ’s emails . And PRP added a spy chip to thousands of computers WDT were purchased by top U.S. companies . Now , U.S. tech giant Google is VBG ahead with its contract to develop a customized , censored version of DT search engine to help NNP perfect its internet chokehold . Google employees with a conscience and a clue are quitting rather than support DT Communist regime . Things are bad in NNP and PRP predict PRP will only VB worse .

As PRP detailed , DT train is VBN to have been entombed in DT vast tunnel labyrinth located close to Ksiaz castle , which served as Nazi headquarters during NNP War II … … and specifically , was VBN to be located at DT foot of DT Sowa mountain , in DT woods three miles outside DT town of Walbrych . DT “ gold train ” is VBN to be located under this hill While JJ were skeptical IN DT mystical Nazi treasure train had been finally discovered after JJ NNS of searching , an official update last Friday by DT Polish NN suggested IN DT MD indeed be DT case . As DT Mail reported on Friday , a representative of DT Polish culture ministry , Poland ’s National Heritage and Conservation Officer Piotr Zuchowski , VBD IN DT man who helped hide DT train had revealed its location shortly before he died , and IN proof of DT train has been observed on radar . Zuchowski added IN “ Information about where this train is and what its contents are were revealed on DT deathbed of a person who had knowledge of DT secret of this train . ’ He added IN Polish authorities had now seen evidence of DT train ’s existence in a picture taken using a ground - penetrating radar . He VBD DT image – albeit blurred – showed DT shape of a train platform and cannons . Mr Zuchowski VBD DT find was ‘ unprecedented ’ , adding : ‘ PRP do not VB what is inside DT train . ‘ Probably military equipment but RB possibly jewellery , works of art and archive documents . ‘ Armored trains from this period were used to carry extremely valuable items and this is an armored train , PRP is a big clue . ’ He VBD authorities were now ’ 99 percent sure DT train exists ’ and whatever is on PRP will be returned to DT rightful owners , if PRP can be found . ‘ PRP will be 100 per cent sure only when PRP find DT train , ’ Mr Zuchowski added . DT train found in DT mountains is an ‘ armored train ’ which looks similar to DT CD pictured Mr Zuchowski told reporters IN DT train was about 100 metres long but added : ‘ PRP is not possible to disclose DT exact location of where DT train can be found . Still , he noted cryptically IN “ DT local NN in Walbrzych knows where PRP is . ” He explained PRP is hidden along a 4 km stretch of track on DT Wroclaw - Walbrzych line . Mr Zuchowski VBD DT person who claimed he helped load DT gold train in 1945 VBD in a ‘ deathbed statement ’ DT train is secured with explosives . DT official declined to comment further about DT man who VBD this but speculation is now rife IN PRP was a former SS guard or a local Pole who stumbled upon DT train before hiding PRP . Deputy Mayor of Walbrzych , Zygmunt Nowaczyk told DT press : ‘ DT city is full of mysterious stories because of its history . ‘ Now PRP is formal information – PRP have found something . ’ Key excerpts from DT press conference by DT Polish official can be seen on DT Euronews clip below : DT confirmation of DT discovery unleashed a surge of treasury hunters , and forced DT Polish NN to warn DT population to stop looking because PRP MD be booby - trapped and dangerous . Zuchowski VBD “ foragers ” have become active since two NNS claimed to have discovered DT train last week and urged eager fortune - hunters to stop searching , saying PRP risk injury or death . Zuchowski adds IN “ EX MD be hazardous substances dating from DT Second NNP War in DT hidden train , which I ’m convinced exists . I am appealing to NNS to stop any such searches until DT end of official procedures leading to DT securing of DT find . EX ’s a huge probability IN DT train is booby - trapped . ’ If anything , tthese warnings are sure to unleash an even more aggressive wave of seekers now IN DT train ’s existience has been confirmed , and DT NN is actually warning seekers to be careful in their search . But perhaps what is more interesting is just what DT discovery , which MD be straight out of an Indiana Jones sequel , will contain , and whether someone already got to DT precious cargo over DT past 7 decades .

So DT moment he put foot to soccer ball at age 8 , he knew he ’d met his match in sports . He slept with his soccer ball ; he dribbled up and down DT stairs in his home in Arlington Heights , Ill. , driving his mother nuts . “ I played soccer IN a madman , ” he says . Although he MD have his indoor - dribbling problem under control , McBride , 29 , still has DT same passion . A striker for professional soccer ’s Columbus Crew , he ’s often called DT Michael Jordan of DT U.S. game for his gravity - defying airborne maneuvers . His talents VBP on worldwide display June 5 , when DT U.S. team takes on Portugal in its first game of DT NNP Cup , DT monthlong international soccer orgy , in South Korea and Japan . This is not DT first NN around on DT NN pitch for DT 6 ’ 1 ″ McBride . He scored America ’s only goal in DT ’98 competition in France . “ PRP was just an awesome feeling , ” says McBride . ( As in France , DT U.S. is expected to be KO ’d early in Korea . ) And McBride remains a bright spot . “ PRP do n’t have another player with his capabilities , ” says ESPN lead soccer analyst Ty Keough . “ He ’s taken what God gave him and made DT most out of PRP . ” Yet he ’s had to overcome his share of challenges . In September of 2000 , while McBride was spending DT off - season with an English soccer franchise , he noticed a sudden , dramatic swelling in his armpit after a game . PRP turned out to be thoracic outlet syndrome , a rare disorder in which compression of DT blood vessels causes dangerous blood clots . Though DT condition was not life - threatening , PRP put his career in jeopardy . Doctors performed surgery to dissipate DT clot , and after two months he was back on DT field . In August 2001 he developed another painful clot in his right arm . This NN surgeons removed a rib to relieve pressure on McBride ’s veins . “ I have never seen anyone quite so sick , ” Maddie McBride Bisulca , 56 , recalls of her son , who has since recovered so completely IN doctors say DT disorder will not recur . “ He was so courageous and strong . ” But he was not quite ready to quit DT sport he adored . His brother Matt remembers visiting him in a Denver hospital and trying to cheer him up . “ If PRP never play another day , ” Matt told him , “ everything will still be fine . ” DT attempt at comfort was met with heart - wrenching silence . “ PRP MD see PRP come over his face , ” says Matt . “ He was just very sad . ” McBride is DT rambunctious second of three NNS Maddie had with husband Matthew , an advertising sales representative ( whom she divorced when Brian was 4 ) . “ If I did n’t keep DT doors padlocked , then he always MD find a way to run outside , ” says Maddie , who raised DT kids on her own , often holding down three jobs . “ He just never liked to be still . ” He was RB a natural on DT field . After stellar high school and college careers — he was a two - NN All - American at Saint Louis University — he landed a professional gig in Wolfsburg , Germany , where he was disappointed to find IN JJ of his fellow players treated DT sport he loved as a mere occupation . “ PRP were n’t supposed to be happy , ” he says . “ PRP were supposed to be doing your job . ” He was thrilled to return to DT U.S. , where in 1996 DT Crew picked him as DT first player in DT fledgling Major League Soccer ’s inaugural draft . Turns out his bout with illness was RB an opportunity of sorts . Recuperating from his first surgery back in Arlington Heights , he ran into Dina Barnett , a childhood acquaintance who was VBG through a divorce . “ He was DT most caring and loving person I ’d ever met , ” she recalls of their first meeting . Last February PRP married , making McBride stepfather to Dina ’s daughter Ashley , nearly 2 . Fully recovered , McBride relishes being a dad , but with DT heavy travel schedule of his pro team as well as DT U.S. national team , he gets only limited NN with DT family . Still , he is getting back a little bit of what he dished out as a kid . “ Ashley ’s so active — she ’s always running around , ” he says . “ But if she wants to learn soccer , I ’ll help . ”"

DT only NNS who did n't bind their feet were DT very poor , ethnic Hakka NNS , and women who worked in fishing because PRP had needed to have normal feet in order to balance themselves on boats . At what age did girls VB their feet bound ? What did DT practice entail ? Girls MD have their feet bound between DT ages of four and six ; any younger , DT girls MD n't endure DT pain , and by DT NN PRP were older than six their feet had already grown too large . Four to six was DT ideal age because PRP MD reason with DT girls and help them deal with DT pain . Foot binding MD occur in a ritualistic ceremony accompanied by other traditions intending to ward of bad luck . DT procedure entailed bending DT girls ' toes underneath DT sole , using very long ribbons to wrap their feet all DT way to DT ankle . Basically , DT idea was to keep breaking DT foot whenever PRP grew too large , a process WDT usually took between two and three NNS . Then DT feet MD be bound for DT rest of DT girl 's life . DT girls , naturally , developed a peculiar way of walking — almost as if PRP had hooves . And in order to facilitate moving around , women with bound feet developed strong muscles in their hips , thighs , and buttocks , so much so IN these characteristics were considered physically attractive to DT Chinese men of DT era . When did foot binding VB out of favor ? In DT 19th century , toward DT end of DT Qing Dynasty , Western NNS effectively colonized NNP and JJ Western NNS began to move to DT country . This coincided with DT height of foot binding , when DT practice was most prevalent . So JJ Western women , especially DT wives of Christian missionaries , became strong advocates against DT practice , producing pamphlets and even opening shelters in support of afflicted women . Around DT same NN , Chinese intellectuals who had studied abroad in Europe and in North America returned to NNP and stated their support for abolishment . So by DT NN Pearl Buck was writing in 1923 , after DT Qing Dynasty had fallen , DT practice had become unfashionable . This NN in fashion suddenly had a perverse side effect : a lot of girls who had had their feet bound in order to become marriageable suddenly found themselves abandoned by their husbands because foot binding was no longer fashionable . Worse , in bigger cities some NNS MD catch women with bound feet and cut off their bindings , a humiliation because these women MD never , ever show their bare feet to anyone — not even their husbands . For them , DT process WDT began with a lot of pain and tears likewise ended with pain and tears ."

In DT post , police exhorted : ' If PRP see Bigfoot , please do not shoot at him / her , as PRP 'll most likely be wounding a fun-loving and well - intentioned person , sweating in a gorilla costume . ' DT post RB stated , tongue - firmly - in - cheek IN after having reviewed shaky video of an apparent Bigfoot sighting from 2015 , 'we can say with some confidence IN proof of Bigfoot still eludes PRP . ' DT police linked to DT video , which showed a Yorkie trying to scare off a two - footed , rapidly moving entity in daylight .

John Bruner , of Bigfoot 911 , reported IN at DT NN of DT apparent sighting , he and six others were in DT woods , spreading out glow sticks in hopes of attracting Bigfoot 's attention . According to DT Charlotte Observer , Bruner wrote in a Facebook post IN , ' I turned on my headlamp and saw a large bi-pedal animal covered in hair .

PRP are , in fact , DT names of two mechanical giants designed to make NNS safer from DT estimated 60 million land mines scattered around DT NN . Working in tandem , DT pair destroy mines in ways WDT are faster and safer � and more ecofriendly and cost - effective � than any system to date . "" By DT end of this NN , "" says inventor Bob French , "" PRP will have DT first two machines in Bosnia - Herzegovina . "" RB , with DT continued assistance of DT British NN 's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency ( dera ) , Bigfoot and Mineworm will help to destroy some of DT estimated 1 million mines left over from DT 1992 - 95 war . Mines continue to kill up to 10 NNS RB each month . DT idea for Bigfoot and Mineworm began in early 1997 , when Leicestershire - based French watched a television report of DT Princess of Wales ' trip to central Angola . As Diana inspected a minefield , wearing a flak jacket and face shield , French 's eye was drawn to those working nearby . "" NNS were poking sticks in DT ground , "" he recalls , using DT same mine - clearance methods he saw during his Royal Air Force service decades earlier , in Borneo and Sarawak . "" Mines are unsophisticated weapons and PRP need an unsophisticated method of dealing with them , "" says French , who has a broad industrial background in electronics . After research and consultation with mine clearers , he concluded IN two remote - controlled and camera - equipped machines were needed . DT first , Bigfoot , has piston - driven armored feet WDT stamp every square centimeter of ground WDT DT machine passes over , detonating any mines . Bigfoot has no need of minefield maps , and its system of shock absorption , blast deflection and NN dissipation prevents damage from antipersonnel devices . If larger , antitank mines damage CD of DT feet , a replacement can be installed in DT field . Trailing in Bigfoot 's wake , Mineworm excavates up to 55 cm of soil . PRP removes and crushes all unexploded ordnance , including faulty mines , sorts out ferrous metal for further inspection and � unlike its heavier military predecessors � returns noncompacted soil to DT ground , allowing crop planting and growth . Having passed initial tests in DT U.K. , DT 5 - ton prototypes of French 's Land Mine Disposal System ( LMDS ) are being fined - tuned to make them smaller so PRP can be more easily transported and maneuvered on country roads and bridges . After a three - month field trial in Bosnia � in which teams of mine clearers using dogs will follow DT machines to verify IN nothing is missed � PRP are expected to remain at work RB . "" PRP 's pretty certain IN DT prototype does what Bob says PRP will , "" says Colin Lowe , project manager for dera 's Countermine Warfare Research Team , which oversaw two weeks of trials on sandy hills , clay soil and mud in England . "" No NN machine is VBG to clear DT NN of mines , "" says Lowe , but French 's system takes a "" golf - bag approach , "" using different tools for different tasks on different terrains . Pat Banks , an independent land mines consultant working in Bosnia � where fewer than 60 sq km were cleared last NN � considers DT machines "" absolutely essential . "" Depending on terrain , PRP can clear up to 500 sq m in an hour ; a human team MD cover perhaps 200 sq m in a day . Initial development funds for French 's prototypes came from a business friend , Rupert King . Today , DT LMDS is supported by Redbus Investments , set up in 1998 by entrepreneur Cliff Stanford . "" This British solution to a JJ tragedy is testament to DT wealth of innovation WDT exists in this country , "" Stanford says . "" PRP now need governments and aid agencies to come on board and VB Bigfoot and Mineworm in DT field . "" Given DT speed at which DT LMDS can clear mines , French argues , international donors such as DT European Union , DT U.S. and Canada "" MD VB more for their aid dollars . "" DT cost of DT two machines � plus attachments , spare parts , training and field support � MD be about $ 750,000 in DT first NN , he says , but then MD drop to about $ 300,000 . While Bigfoot and Mineworm are being prepared for Bosnia , French is making his own plans . He wants to play football with local NNS in a field WDT his machines have made safe . Even farther down DT unmined road , he says , he'd VB to VB out of business � in a NN WDT no longer has any land mines ."

DT discovery of "" something large , hairy and frozen in NN "" in woods in America by a heroic police officer made international headlines and attracted interest from a team who have been earnestly searching for DT legendary ape - JJ beast for NNS . PRP purchased DT remains for an undisclosed fee and set about DT delicate process of thawing DT body . So PRP is hard to imagine just how disappointing PRP must have been to discover , not Sasquatch , but a rubber gorilla suit . Steve Kulls , of Squatchdetective.com and host of Squatchdetective Radio , revealed DT bad NN : Matt Whitton , a police officer on leave after being shot while on duty , and Rick Dyer , a former Georgia corrections officer , had achieved fame on a JJ scale with a hoax of breathtaking transparency . As PRP held a much publicised press conference in California on 15 August about their alleged discovery in DT wooded hills of Georgia , near a remote region where sightings of DT creature are often reported , Whitton had insisted : "" Everyone who has talked down to PRP is VBG to eat their words . "" DT pair , who were offering weekend Bigfoot tracking expeditions for about £ 250 , described DT creature as a 7ft 7in , male , weighing over 560 lb ( 255kg ) , with huge human - IN feet and reddish hair . Hundreds of thousands watched videos of DT remains posted on YouTube . NNS started to believe . Mr Kulls VBD : "" A police officer of seven NNS , on JJ leave , labelled as a hero for being wounded in DT line of duty , got up in front of DT NN and told DT NN of how he and Mr Dyer uncovered this creature , "" he VBD . "" On August 16 , DT freezer containing DT alleged corpse arrived with DT Searching For Bigfoot Team . "" DT NN was being thawed slowly without aid , to prevent any decomposition of DT alleged corpse . PRP estimated IN DT freezer and its contents weighed over 1,500lbs and PRP MD take several days or longer to thaw completely . "" DT following day PRP were up early to discover IN some hair was now exposed . I extracted some from DT alleged corpse , examined PRP and had some concerns . "" DT team decided to burn a sample which PRP VBD "" melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair "" . "" PRP began an expedited melting process . Within CD hour PRP were able to see DT partially exposed head ... I was able to feel IN PRP seemed mostly firm , but unusually hollow in CD small section . This was yet another ominous sign , "" Mr Kulls VBD . "" Within DT next hour of thaw , a break appeared up near DT feet area . As DT team and I began examining this area near DT feet , I observed DT foot which looked unnatural , reached in and confirmed PRP was a rubber foot . "" Later DT day , PRP were informed IN Mr Whitton and Mr Dyer had admitted PRP was a costume . "" Phone calls to Whitton and Dyer went unreturned yesterday , but a voicemail recording for their Bigfoot Tip Line , which RB proclaims PRP are searching for leprechauns and DT Loch Ness monster , has been updated with DT information about a JJ search for "" big cats and dinosaurs "" .

"" This morning I have this special proclamation , "" Little VBD , holding up a document with his signature and a gold seal at DT bottom . He read aloud . "" I do hereby proclaim today , Saturday , September 8 , 2018 , IN Bigfoot is DT official animal of DT city of Marion , North Carolina , "" Little VBD , as DT costumed Bigfoot clapped enthusiastically . Thus began DT inaugural Western North Carolina Bigfoot Festival in this town near DT Blue Ridge Mountains about 40 miles east of Asheville . Mayor Steve Little presented Bigfoot with a declaration naming him Marion 's official animal for DT day . Converging on Marion were thousands of believers and skeptics alike , VBN in their celebration of a cryptozoological mystery WDT has fascinated NNS for decades . "" Bigfoot is real , "" VBD festival organizer John Bruner , "" and PRP VBP to bring awareness to DT and bring more NNS to DT table to VB this mystery solved . "" Bruner is part of something called DT Bigfoot 911 research team , which investigates purported Bigfoot sightings and evidence . He has lived in Marion all his life and VBD he decided to stage DT festival after DT town 's business association approached him with DT idea . "" And , at DT same NN , "" he added , "" PRP VBP to have fun and fellowship with our fellow citizens and our visitors . "" If PRP ignored DT Bigfoot T - shirts , DT Bigfoot artwork and DT occasional costumed Bigfoot , DT festival seemed IN any a small Southern city might hold at DT tail end of summer . DT day started with a 5 K before three blocks of downtown Marion 's Main Street were closed to vehicles for DT day . Vendors from North Carolina and beyond sold everything from knit hats to jewelry . EX was barbecue , Chick - fil - A , funnel cakes , shaved NN and plenty of beer for parents who sought refuge in DT shade as their kids frolicked in bouncy houses . DT legendary Bigfoot -- or Sasquatch , if PRP prefer -- is most commonly associated with DT Pacific Northwest . But sightings have been reported all over North America -- including in Marion , VBD Little , who has lived in DT town for decades . Folks around this town of 7,500 report CD or two sightings a NN , he VBD . "" For NNS EX were NNS who MD talk about , ' Oh , I saw a great big old footprint out in DT woods — PRP 's bigger than a coyote , and PRP was n't a bear . ' "" ' Do PRP believe PRP ? ' Bruner 's fellow Bigfoot researchers set up a tent with evidence PRP 'd spent NNS gathering . All day NNS waited in line to examine photographs , video footage , audio recordings and casts of purported Bigfoot feet and hands . Researcher Lee Woods , who has spent a decade chasing Bigfoot , displayed two casts . DT first was a massive foot , 14 inches long and 7 inches wide . DT other was less identifiable . PRP looked sort of IN a clump of plaster and pine straw , with what appeared to be an extra toe . "" PRP 's either 6 toes , which is a deformity , or it's a hand , and DT 's DT knuckles , "" VBD Woods , pointing . "" He 's knuckle - dragging , "" he explained . "" PRP walk upright , but PRP will drop on all fours and knuckle - drag IN a gorilla , and then stand up and take off . "" At a nearby table , researcher Tim Dills displayed a series of photos he captured on trail cameras set up in DT woods . CD appeared to be a picture of brush , but Dills pointed to what he VBD was a face in DT foliage . Two men studied DT photos before walking away . "" Well , do PRP believe PRP ? "" PRP asked . "" Not yet , "" his companion replied . Sitting on a curb nearby was Colby Wollack , who VBD he definitely considers himself a believer . "" EX 's too much land out RB , and EX 's so much evidence , "" he VBD . His wife , Monica Fortenberry , MD n't help but crack a smile . She was skeptical . "" EX 's just no way IN EX is something of this size out in DT woods anywhere , "" she VBD . "" PRP 's either a bear , or PRP 's not . "" Between them was Monica 's brother , Montgomery . He does n't quite believe in Bigfoot — DT evidence did n't convince him — but VBD he considers himself an "" enthusiast . "" "" I VBP PRP 's a great hobby and I VBP NNS should keep doing PRP whether PRP believe in PRP or not , "" he VBD . "" I VBP DT idea of PRP , even if PRP 's never proven . I VBP PRP 's still a good story . "" In DT afternoon , throngs of festivalgoers regrouped on DT courthouse lawn for what organizers dubbed a "" town hall . "" But instead of discussing municipal issues , CD Bigfoot believer after another stood up to share stories of their encounters . CD person mentioned seeing an aging Bigfoot whose fur was graying . Another shared an account of seeing a female Bigfoot and her baby dash into DT woods at around 30 mph . Multiple NNS mentioned "" yellow eyes "" and a foul odor akin to DT scent of a dead animal . Still others described hearing a roar . "" PRP was n't a growl and PRP was n't a scream , "" CD person VBD . "" More IN a guttural , gibberish thing . "" "" PRP 're looking at something WDT do n't exist , "" VBD a man from Virginia . A few folks who shared their stories VBD PRP took NNS for them to screw up DT courage to tell anyone about their Bigfoot sightings for fear of appearing "" crazy . "" "" But I VBP what I heard , "" a woman told DT crowd . "" I VBP what I smelled , and I VBP how PRP made me feel . "" DT lawn was a judgment - free zone . JJ NNS in DT crowd wore T - shirts professing their faith in Sasquatch 's existence . "" Gone Squatchin , "" some shirts VBD ( Yes , DT 's a verb , as in : to "" squatch , "" DT act of looking for Bigfoot ) . Some declared Bigfoot DT Hide and Seek NNP Champion , while others flipped DT tables , saying , "" Bigfoot saw me but nobody believes him . "" Still others bore a simple directive : "" Believe . "" But when CD man stood up to share his story and asked how JJ believers were in DT crowd , only about half raised their hands . JJ of DT researchers VBD PRP are used to doubters , and PRP does n't necessarily bother them . "" I totally respect their opinions , "" Bruner VBD . "" I respect DT fact IN PRP do n't believe , and I just VBP them to respect DT fact IN I do . "" Other researchers VBD PRP encourage skeptics to VB out into DT woods and search for evidence themselves , because PRP 'll never find PRP on a computer . CD Bigfoot researcher , Daniel Hurst , VBD he appreciates skeptics because PRP force him to be diligent in his work . "" PRP 're a very positive thing for PRP , actually , "" he VBD , raising his voice to combat DT sound of a generator fired up nearby . "" For those of PRP who are in DT business for legitimacy , ( skeptics ) keep PRP honest . "" CD group of non-believers VBD PRP were just at DT festival to have a good NN and to enjoy DT company of NNS who were passionate about something . DT was something PRP MD appreciate , PRP VBD . As recordings of purported Bigfoot calls bellowed from DT evidence tent , Micah Loving explained he 's a fan of DT mystery of Bigfoot and understands why DT researchers are excited . But mainly , he VBD , squatchin ' is something fun to do with your friends . "" PRP drink beers and PRP have fun and PRP might hear something and PRP might scream out into DT woods and VB a reaction maybe from some other creature — most likely not a Bigfoot — but PRP 's tons of fun and it's just DT whole hunt , "" he VBD . Loving and his friends had just been to DT evidence tents and VBD PRP were n't persuaded by anything PRP saw .

While DT is certainly DT case , DT movie does more than take liberties with DT Bible : “ Noah ” pushes messages WDT have nothing to do with DT Bible . These messages are actually political and come directly from DT NN elite . DT primary message ? Humanity needs to be cleansed … again . Throughout his movie - making career , Darren Aronofsky has created quite a few controversial movies with a powerful underlying message ( see my article on DT movie Black Swan here ) . None of his work can be considered “ idiotic ” and , despite what critics say , Noah is not an idiotic movie either . Sure , PRP contains giant stone monsters , primitive bazookas and Noah killing a bunch of poor souls , but DT movie is smart enough to effectively communicate several of its core messages , twisting CD of DT oldest tales in DT NN to push an agenda WDT is very 2014 . While JJ viewers were upset about DT JJ liberties taken in this retelling of Noah ’s Ark – a tale WDT exists in Jewish , Christian , and Muslim literature – DT messages added to DT story should be even more upsetting . Noah re-formats this ancient tale to describe DT basic premise of a JJ religion , CD WDT has been pushed on DT masses for NNS . Based on DT elite ’s long - term Agenda of drastically depopulating DT NNP , this JJ religion is about radical environmentalism , DT devaluation ( and even hatred ) of human life , and DT re-alignment of morality towards a JJ axis . Through its odd narrative , DT movie turns DT tale of Noah ’s Ark into an absurd and disturbing adventure WDT leads viewers wondering : Why is God so evil ? And why is Noah such a jerk ? When Noah ’s wife asks him if “ DT Creator ” ( DT ’s DT name for God in DT movie ) will help them survive , Noah ’s answer is almost comedic , as if he was describing a super - villain : While DT Bible explains IN DT Great Flood was caused by a mysterious race of Giants corrupting and “ infecting ” humanity , DT movie does not VB DT route . Instead , PRP repeatedly tells PRP IN humans are evil and deserve to die . Before getting into DT actual story , I need to point out a detail WDT is seemingly trivial , but DT tells loads about DT movie ’s true goal : Why is everybody dressed as if PRP got their clothes from DT NN ’s first Zara store ? These made - for - a- 2014 - audience outfits basically tell PRP IN Noah is not about DT Bible – PRP is about today . PRP is a message to humanity right now , directly from DT elite . While DT premise of Noah is based on DT Biblical story from DT book of Genesis , DT creators invented characters , subplots , symbols , images , and messages to completely reshape DT tale , giving PRP a twisted , disturbing and wholly “ unspiritual ” meaning . Even if PRP watches DT movie fully expecting a “ creative retelling ” of Noah ’s Ark , PRP is difficult to not be disturbed by DT bloody , violent , near - psychopathic tangent taken by DT main character . I mean , Noah actually kills a bunch of NNS in DT movie ! How can DT remotely make sense in DT divine context of DT story ? Well , PRP actually does make sense … when PRP understand IN DT movie is meant to sell a JJ religion dictated by DT NN elite composed of values PRP wants DT masses to adopt . CD of these values is IN human life is cancer on NNP WDT needs to be eradicated . In other words , PRP VBP humans to sincerely believe PRP are evil to justify depopulation . Of course , as DT movie tells PRP , most humans do die … EXCEPT those of DT chosen bloodline . And DT is what DT elite wants PRP to VB . PRP must all die to save DT NNP … except them . Noah is strikingly similar to another movie analyzed on Vigilant Citizen : 2012 . As I noted in this article , 2012 is a disaster movie WDT is essentially about DT rich and powerful NNS ( DT elite ) surviving a gigantic flood while everyone else dies . DT movie was full of references to DT tale of Noah ’s Ark and even shows helicopters transporting various animals to giant ships . DT movie posters of Noah and 2012 are RB strikingly similar . Noah is , therefore , a reconstitution of a biblical story tailor - made to fit DT Agenda continually being pushed by DT elite … and as usual , DT Agenda is rather upsetting . PRP promotes DT idea of massively depopulating DT NNP and sells PRP as an ecological mission . Extreme environmentalism is DT JJ religion being sold to DT masses through fear . This religion is not only promoted in works of fiction , PRP is found in real life monuments . DT Georgia Guidestones is a gigantic collection of stones ( dubbed America ’s Stonehenge ) on which are laid out ten JJ commandments . In DT article I wrote about DT Guidestones , I explain IN PRP was built by members of occult secret societies . DT last commandment of DT stones sums up DT main message of DT movie Noah : In Noah , PRP is explained IN humanity needs to be extinct because PRP is disrespectful to nature . DT is not what is VBN in DT Bible , but DT is DT message this movie ( and DT elite ) wants PRP to absorb . Right from DT first scenes of DT movie , Noah ( dressed in his little Zara outfit ) talks to his kids about hardcore environmental concepts WDT were probably DT last thing on NNS ’s minds in these very ancient times . When Noah ’s son sees a pretty flower and tries to pick PRP , Noah jumps in to stop DT senseless destruction . DT little scene announces Noah ’s rather extreme brand of environmentalism . A little later , Noah sees “ men ” ( a pejorative term in DT movie ) hunting an animal in order to eat PRP . Noah runs to DT rescue of DT animal and stabs CD of DT men in DT leg . He then calls his act of violence “ justice ” . Yes , Noah is apparently an extreme vegan who stabs NNS who eat meat . When Noah ’s son asks him why these evil men believe IN eating meat gives them strength , he replies : This , of course , is not found in DT Bible . PRP is part of DT movie ’s message WDT basically says “ Animals > Humans ” . Throughout DT movie , Noah refers to animals as “ DT innocent ” while humans are perceived as scum who deserve to die . Noah , however , seems to forget IN JJ animals are carnivorous beasts who spend most of their NN hunting and devouring other animals . Some might say : DT is what God intended . At CD point Noah tells his NNS : Throughout DT movie , Noah , DT “ hero of DT movie ” displays absolute hatred for humanity and avoids PRP at all costs . Every NN he sees “ men ” or man-created structures , he automatically becomes worried . Twisting DT Biblical Bit About DT Giants To further its anti-humanity message , DT movie significantly twists and contorts Biblical passages about a mysterious race called DT Giants found in DT book of Genesis . In DT Bible , DT Giants are offsprings of a group of 200 “ Sons of God ” who descended to NNP to mix with humans . PRP are VBN to have taught humans advanced skills such as metallurgy , metal working , cosmetics , sorcery , astrology , astronomy , and meteorology . Because DT Giants disobeyed God , PRP were RB called DT Fallen Angels . ( Interesting note : Lucifer is RB referred to as a Fallen Angel and is VBN to have brought forbidden knowledge to men ) . In DT book of Genesis , PRP is VBN IN DT Giants ( RB called DT Nephilim ) were a hybrid race of sons of God and human females . DT Nephilim are described in DT Bible ( and other apocryphal texts ) as a race of giants who lived among humans . PRP ultimately became a destructive presence and were VBN to have consumed “ all acquisitions of men ” . In order to rid these beings from NNP ( along with DT humans who mixed with them ) God caused DT Great Flood . DT Bible , therefore , describes DT Giants as DT main cause of humanity ’s corruption . DT movie , however , portrays DT exact opposite . In Noah , DT Giants are described as gentle teachers who came to aid humans , but ultimately became victims of humanity ’s cruelty . Later , Giants actually help Noah build DT Ark ! In short , DT movie inverted important parts of DT Bible to say IN humanity is solely responsible for its demise because PRP had evolved into a NN WDT was beyond repair . DT movie RB makes PRP clear IN its anti-humanity message is still applicable today . In CD significant part of DT movie , Noah tells his family DT “ first story he ever heard ” . PRP begins with DT first line of DT Bible “ In DT beginning , EX was light ” but then devolves into a grim speech about DT evils of humanity . DT movie , therefore , pushes DT viewers to conclude IN humanity is , once again , beyond hope . Massive depopulation is therefore not a horrible catastrophe but a necessary “ cleansing process ” . Noah himself says : This line is not from DT Bible . PRP comes from DT minds of psychopaths who VBP to depopulate DT NNP and describing PRP as a “ cleansing process ” . Depopulation is good . Death equals cleansing . In DT end , Noah realizes IN not all humanity needs to die after DT flood : His family survives . And EX lies another important message of DT movie : Depopulation does not apply to all humanity . PRP only applies to those who are not part of DT “ chosen ” bloodline . This is DT kind of DT message DT occult elite wants PRP to assimilate because PRP believe PRP are DT chosen bloodline . PRP ’s All About DT Bloodline Spoiler alert : Noah and his family survive DT Great Flood . But no NN else does . Right from DT beginning of DT movie , PRP are told IN DT survival of humanity must VB through a specific bloodline . Viewers immediately learn IN Noah descends from Seth while DT bad guys descend from Cain – a fact WDT is apparently VERY important . Of course , none of this is mentioned in DT Bible . PRP is CD of DT JJ fabrications added to flesh out DT story and to give PRP a specific angle : God favors a specific bloodline . Later in DT movie , Noah ’s father , Methuselah , is depicted as a reclusive but supernatural being who magically guides Noah through DT Creator ’s plan . While Methuselah was never mentioned in DT Bible as having a role in DT construction of DT Ark , this addition strengthens DT idea of DT bloodline . EX are other strange “ non-Biblical ” additions to DT movie WDT ultimately makes PRP VB IN Noah is not a “ man of God ” , but a jerk who only wants to see his bloodline survive . For instance : Noah actually kills a bunch of NNS . In another gut - wrenching ( and completely invented ) scene , Noah purposely allows his son ’s girlfriend to be trampled to death by hundreds of NNS . How can a man , WDT is supposedly chosen by DT Creator , allow DT death of an innocent girl ? Why was this added to DT movie ? Because PRP is continuously communicating a message : Whether she was good or not is irrelevant . DT girl was not part of DT bloodline . Therefore , she must die . PRP is not about being a good person . PRP is about who PRP descend from . After DT flood , Noah turns into a disturbed , depressive , psychopath . When he learns IN his daughter - in - law is pregnant , he is convinced IN he must kill DT little girl to make sure IN humanity does not reproduce . Noah , however , realizes something incredible : He does not feel IN stabbing his own granddaughter in DT face . Although he first believes IN he had let down DT Creator by not killing DT girl , he ultimately learns IN he did DT right thing by “ showing mercy ” . But what about DT countless humans he killed ? Was n’t EX any mercy for them ? No . Because PRP were not part of DT bloodline . DT Creator allowed Noah to murder NNS when PRP were not “ chosen ” . Incidentally , DT is what DT occult elite believes . DT movie depicts Noah ’s “ divine ” quest as a cruel and violent process carried out by a man who is steadily turning into a psychopath . While stranded on DT Ark , his own family begins to resent him as he obsesses over DT fact IN everybody needs to die . While he is merely following DT Creator ’s orders , he appears to be animated by a deep - seeded hate of humanity , which leaves viewers with an “ unholy ” feeling . EX is , however , a character WDT counterbalances Noah ’s “ do PRP my way or else ” doctrine : Tubal - Cain . Tubal - Cain is DT “ leader of humans ” , and , therefore , Noah ’s mortal enemy . While Tubal - Cain is DT “ bad guy ” , he is ironically DT character who says DT most thoughtful and sensible lines , which causes viewers to somewhat identify with him . Contrarily to Noah , he is not ashamed to be human and is proud of humanity ’s accomplishments . Furthermore , he feels somewhat forsaken by DT Creator who left his kind to roam a desolate land . He seeks to emancipate himself from DT Creator ’s rule through his own means . In this sense , he is a representative of a Gnostic point of view WDT perceives DT Creator a demiurge – a lower god who imprisoned mankind in a material NN . This is why God is called “ DT Creator ” in DT movie . PRP refers to DT Gnostic concept of demiurge , DT near - malevolent creator of DT material NN . Tubal - Cain is briefly mentioned in DT Bible as a “ forger of all instruments of bronze and iron ” and an “ instructor of every artificer in brass and iron ” . However , he is never mentioned in DT story of DT Great Flood and has no link with Noah . So why did DT makers of DT movie choose this obscure Biblical character to become Noah ’s arch - nemesis ? Because , while Tubal - Cain is an obscure figure in DT Bible , he is an extremely important figure in DT most widespread Gnostic Mystery School on NNP : Freemasonry . Not unlike Hiram Abiff ( a leading figure in Masonic lore and ritual ) , Tubal - Cain is an obscure Biblical figure who takes a great importance in esoteric teachings . As a proficient maker of weapons , he represents humanity ’s potential to build its own power – without DT Creator . Various Masonic sources describe DT esoteric significance of Tubal - Cain . In Manly P. Hall ’s “ DT Lost Keys of Freemasonry ” , Tubal - Cain is described as DT “ forefather ” of Freemasons . Mystery Schools love Biblical characters who did not rely on God to gain knowledge and power . Tubal - Cain is a prime example . In Noah , Tubal - Cain attempts to communicate with DT Creator – not as a servant , IN Noah , but as an equal . Although Tubal - Cain realizes IN humanity is about to be wiped away , he finds an unexpected person to carry on his legacy : Noah ’s own son , Ham . Throughout Noah ’s quest , Ham feels ignored , rejected and infantilized . He feels IN he cannot become a man without being with a woman – a right WDT is denied by his father . Tired of being punished and humiliated , Ham leaves DT Ark and mixes with DT “ nasty ” humans . RB , he finds a “ good girl ” he wants to marry . However , Noah leaves her to die and drags Ham back to DT Ark by force . When Ham meets Tubal - Cain , he finds DT kind of father figure he has been looking for . Instead of a life of blind servitude , Tubal - Cain offered Ham DT means to be a “ real ” man . During DT flood , Tubal - Cain found a way to sneak inside DT Ark and , while hidden with DT animals , he “ initiated ” Ham to his philosophy . While these words were VBN by DT “ bad guy ” , he was nearly quoting actual Biblical verses . This only adds to DT movie ’s general confusion and mixed messages . Tubal - Cain then ultimately urges Ham to kill his father : Ham does not kill his father … he kills Tubal - Cain . However , this fateful act does not seem to bother Tubal - Cain . To DT contrary , he knows IN , by killing him , Ham has successfully completed his initiation . While dying , Tubal - Cain tells Ham : After surviving DT flood , Ham does not reintegrate with Noah ’s family . He leaves them behind and makes his own path . PRP do n’t VB if Ham managed to reproduce ( probably not ) . However , PRP do VB IN , in DT Bible , DT story WDT immediately follows Noah ’s Ark is DT story of DT Tower of Babel – a gigantic tower built by humans to “ fight God ” . PRP appears IN DT Great Flood did not “ cleanse ” anything and IN Tubal - Cain ’s lineage survived DT Flood after all . In DT Bible , DT story of Noah ’s Ark is told in a few simple verses and is filled with enigmatic bits WDT are never explained ( i.e. who were DT Giants exactly ? ) . DT movie Noah fills in DT answers to some of these questions in its own way by augmenting DT Biblical tale with fabricated stories and characters , ultimately giving this ancient story a very modern twist . DT same way Russell Crowe ’s snazzy outfits were tailor - made for a 2014 audience , DT messages in Noah were RB tailor - made for a 2014 audience . DT movie basically presents two philosophical views : CD WDT is meant for DT ignorant masses and CD WDT is meant for “ those in DT NN ” . DT ignorant masses are told to follow a radical brand of environmentalism WDT leads to self - hatred : Because humanity is DT evil force behind war , suffering and DT destruction of nature , PRP needs to be “ cleansed ” . This message fits with DT occult elite ’s depopulation Agenda and is embodied by Noah . At DT other end of DT spectrum , Tubal - Cain represents humans seeking godhood , acquiring DT physical and mental tools to reach DT same status as DT Creator . This is DT Gnostic philosophy adopted by DT occult elite . While embodied by DT “ bad guy ” , PRP is nevertheless presented as an alternative to DT absurdity of DT Creator who created humanity to then destroy PRP . In short , Noah is far from an “ idiotic ” movie ( as some reviewers have stated ) . PRP manages to sell a NNP Age religion based on self - hatred while giving a nod to DT occult elite , those who fancy themselves to be descendants of Tubal - Cain . But DT occult elite does not believe in radical environmentalism OR care about human life . PRP are DT ones behind all our major wars and their greed is DT main cause of nature ’s destruction . Through movie ’s IN Noah , PRP are trying to put DT burden of their own wrongdoings on DT unsuspecting masses who usually do as PRP are told . PRP VBP PRP to welcome DT idea of a “ great cleansing ” . In DT Bible , after DT Great Flood , God himself VBZ : So , whether PRP believe in DT Bible or not , VB IN if EX is another major “ cleansing ” on NNP , PRP will not come from “ DT Creator ” . PRP will come from those who have brainwashed PRP for NNS , convincing PRP to believe PRP are a cancer on NNP ."

I marked PRP out on a piece of plywood in a very simple way ; Just made an  18  of DT appropriate size on a sheet of paper IN this : Then cut a square meter of plywood ; set DT paper template on PRP and poked through each of DT 18 points in turn using a bradawl before moving DT paper on to its next position until all seven  18s were marked with little holes on DT plywood : I then stuck a tiny TB to each point using contact adhesive and PRP was done . As I was positioning DT final few mini-TBs ; a fresh blustery wind started blowing and Sylphs began to appear in numbers . At dusk ; three small lenticular clouds appeared in DT sky right above DT 108 but PRP was already too dark to take a photograph . Today DT Sylphs arrived again in numbers and PRP even had a visit from a black helicopter around midday . As night falls once more ; DT sky is filled with unseasonal rainclouds .. DT individual TBs are no bigger than a bottle - top and yet DT sum total appears to be profoundly positive . Dan . Good job , Carolien -- I 'm blown away by DT quality of DT work ! My patterns are kind of crude by comparison . Our business was under radionics assault a month ago , characterized by sharply , suddenly dwindled orders . On DT day when I set up a 108 DT orders started coming in as before and stayed steady until a week ago , when I delivered DT 108 to Dooney and Steve . Then DT orders dwindled again , for Carol and I . I 'm waiting for some feedback from Dooney and Stevo , since PRP are RB under constant radionics assault . DT other business person , besides Carolien , who is particularly targetted DT way is Andy Schwarm of ctbusters.com . I 'm not happy IN PRP 're being perpetually smacked by DT CIA and NSA this way but I 'm glad nobody else among our associates evidently is . I 'm making another pattern , now , and will make some trick , conical orgonite bits for each of DT 108 points . I 'll use TBs sort of IN Andy's , this NN , and will add nice crystals and spiral coils inside . Cones and pyramids have almost equal NN dynamics , evidently , and I bet DT cone shape will really blast out . I do n't mind DT lull in business , much , because I had n't been able to VB ahead with production , so my personal life was suffering . I 'm definitely NOT a workaholic . PRP 's still early to make any claims for this device , which was invented by Cesco , based perhaps on Kelly 's earlier field experiments . Promoting PRP is a little bit dicey because Cesco has n't mentioned whether he favors others profitting from this intellectual property . RB , when he was last here , a NN and a half ago , he was uncertain whether an identical orgonite piece should VB in DT center of each of DT seven hexagram ' cells , ' which MD make DT number , 115 rather than 108 . Just because Carol and I long ago gave away DT plans for orgonite cloudbbusters , DT Succor Punch , Powerwand , DT Big Secret , Holy Handgrenades and Towerbusters does n't mean IN PRP 's appropriate for other inventors to give away their creations , of course . I 'm sure not giving away DT formulas for DT ' secret ingredients ' of our own commercial offerings , after allbecause PRP VBP to keep a competitive edge and EX is always more than CD way to accomplish anything . DT VBN , I 'd be very pleased if PRP 's appropriate for Carolien to market these beautiful templates and perhaps DT orgonite WDT goes on them . Since DT orgonite is interactive I VBP PRP MD be productive to boost PRP with gems , coils , etc. , in an intelligent way . DT only way to VB a good idea of DT device 's parameters is to VB a whole lot of them in DT hands of NNS who are in a position to give substantive feedback . DT 's how PRP test our own mods before PRP decide to market them . ~Don In last weeks chat , Don mentioned IN he had made a small 108 ( a little over a square meter ) to stop radionics on his biz and was making some more to help out Stevo , Dooney and others . Radionics are often used to put a dome over our businesses , to make them invisible for customers . Frequently PRP boost each others biz to clear these etheric fogs . I MD n't wait to make my own 108 and started DT next day making a template on paper , using DT picture Cesco once posted on EW ( enlarged 6 times for DT square meter endresult ) : See picture on whale . to page : http://www.whale.to/b/108 However , taping DT twentyfour pages together into CD print , turned out rather messy . Despite my tongue in cheek effort , DT circle became all crooked . Using my compasses to draw DT 108 on another sheet , left me with a buzzing headache of all DT measurements . I sure lost my touch with maths ! So in DT end , I gave myself a break and ordered a weatherproof outdoor poster of DT 108 template on pvc sheet . This Dutch company makes a 110x110 cm sheet for about 108 euroA perfect size for using half size tb's with 5 cm diameter . PRP is quite easy ( and cheaper ) to have CD made by a company in your own country - just look for vinyl outdoor poster / banner sellers on DT Internet , EX are lots ! JJ outdoor poster sellers have a download option for your own picture on a banner . All PRP have to do is : 1 ) download DT 108 picture on http://www.whale.to/b/108 2 ) enlarge PRP 6 times on your own computer ( to match DT approximate square meter ) 3 ) and order a banner at DT size to fit DT enlarged templateHere is my finished 108 - well , almost finished , I had to make CD more small tb ... PRP is too soon to tell wether PRP is really working against DT radionics on my biz . PRP has n't been up for a day yet . But for what PRP 's worth : my computer screen stopped flickering for DT first NN in a NN ( I had grown accustomed to DT flickering ! Thought PRP was due to old age . Hopefully PRP does n't start tomorrow again , hehe ) . Physically , I felt my feet charka burning healthy unlike I have experienced in over a NN too . So far , so good . I will report more in NN . PRP MD be my pleasure to order a template for EW members . Since PRP all are radionics targets , our observations might be worthwhile . Please PM me for DT . Carolien These are essentially simple geometrical patterns , based on hexagonal partitions of circles . Some NNS regard these geometries as sacred . DT idea for DT 108 was first proposed and tested by Cesco of matheriaetherica.com In DT meantime a few etheric warriors have started trying them out .

DT final kick to overcome my natural inertia and VB busy with this experiment came from DT feedback WDT some of DT first experimentors gave : DT NN of this setup is appartently very strong and MD give extended protection against all kinds of etheric interference .

PRP have hung PRP on DT wall of our kitchen which serves as our dinng room as well . Whenever I walk past PRP , I feel compelled to stand in front of PRP and spead DT arms in order to soak up DT NN . DT night after PRP was finished , I went into DT EW chat and asked DT psychics if PRP MD pick up some interference on our business , because I had a week with very low orders and PRP felt IN CD of DT usual radionics blockades PRP so frequently have to put up with . DT feedback I got from Axel DT evening was , IN DT NN of DT JJ 108 is so strong , PRP has already blasted away all interference . Finished and klaar then as PRP say in South Africa ? A day later I went to visit our highly psychic friend Valda and on just telling her about PRP , she MD tune into DT NN and confirmed IN PRP 's extremely powerful . I 'm still "" under DT influence "" , but I suggest PRP follow DT discussion on EW and in DT etheric NN forum .  Doing PRP all over Africa and sending PRP out to DT NN check out our website and read our expedition reports DT 108 is a geometrical arrangement of orgonite towerbusters on a pattern very similar to what is known as "" DT flower of life "" .

I MD VB to report IN my opinion has been modified somewhat in DT light of more recent experience with DT device . Following my initial glowing impressions of its effects ( mostly on DT sky ) ; I began to notice a number of more negative changes in DT area . DT sky became hazy and cloudless and DT wind dropped ; rather in DT way PRP does during a concerted chemtrail attack ( but EX were no chemtrails ) and DT Sylphs completely disappeared . PRP each began to exhibit classic symptoms of DT effects of DOR ( headaches , poor sleep patterns , listlessness and lack of inspiration ) all highly unusual given DT quantity of orgonite in DT area . PRP was almost as though DT three CBs in my garden had all stopped working in unison . After a few days ; my suspicions fell on DT wonderful 108 WDT everyone ( myself included ) was raving about . Id assembled PRP with meticulous precision from small pieces of simple orgonite so EX MD be nothing wrong with DT stone - combinations or coils as EX were none ( RB DT drawing was both correct and accurately drafted ) . DT easy way to find out was to simply take PRP away from its then horizontal position ( where DT NN vortex was presumably effecting DT sky ) and stand PRP upright against DT workshop wall . Almost immediately DT gentle breeze returned and DT sky slowly cleared and PRP seemed IN DT CBs were beginning to work normally again . DT subjective negative effects on each of PRP continued though and Id find myself staring into space when EX were things to be done ; apparently lost for an idea . Finally I dismantled DT 108 and put DT component pieces away . All DT negative effects evaporated and DT area returned to normal ( and has remained this way ever since ) . As I say ; I do not VB where to attribute DT source of this negativity ; given DT wholesale endorsement of DT 108 by a range of experienced orgonite experimenters , some of whom have posted in this thread . DT only other 108 I ever made was constructed from lawn - busters  ( orgonite spikes WDT are trodden into soft ground ) . Each spike of orgonite contained a Cesco coil and a quartz chip and I set them in DT soil ( EP - style ) with a hammer . On DT occasion ; I remember a fresh blustery breeze starting as I had nearly completed DT arrangement and initial good effects on DT atmosphere . For some reason I became disaffected with DT initial 108 and eventually dug PRP out of DT ground and threw DT pieces in DT Bali Strait on a trip to Java . I didnt suspect DT integrity of DT 108 matrix at DT NN and just assumed IN EX must have been a conflict between so JJ coils set in close proximity to each other . I do not pretend to understand these negative effects of DT 108 and I realize IN this is not DT first NN IN my findings have been completely at odds with DT general consensus on this forum . I hope IN others do not experience anything similar and IN DT 108 continues to VB rave reviews . I MD however be dishonest if I allowed my earlier impressions of DT device to stand uncorrected . Dan . Kelly has reminded me IN this is not his invention , by DT way . I VBP I was giving DT impression IN PRP is . This is Cesco 's tentative presentation and Kelly has gone on to experiment with a 114 arrangement . So far , PRP 've had nothing but good experiences with ours , as have Dooney and STevo and CD or two others . PRP looked closely at your problem in Dooney 's chatroom , yesterday , and focused mainly on DT unhappy entity WDT Kelly found on / under your property . Stevo evidently got into a dialog with this NN and all DT psychics had DT impression IN DT entity is an elemental who is extremely displeased with DT NN order 's manipulation and sabotage of Bali 's NN field , RB not able or willing to distinguish DT from your own engineering . Francie , early on , clearly saw a witch doctor looking closely at PRP these days and IN CD is probably associated with DT elemental & anxious about DT technology PRP 're using . Bali is DT only island in DT enormous archipelago , as far as I VBP , whose inhabitants have mostly held to DT older ways and did n't embrace Islam when Arab merchants and scholars went RB so JJ centuries ago . I VBP PRP was only DT Turks and perhaps Moghuls who forced conversion to Islam , which was very much against Muhammad 's teachings . DT style of Hinduism in Bali seems to me IN DT more ancient animism WDT PRP see in Tibetan Buddhism and Shintoism , which MD be to say IN DT ' older ways ' involve close cooperation with elementals . A nice confirmation of DT MD be DT way IN DT Shinto priests whom Tetsuzi - san met were eager to accept his orgonite gifts for their shrine / vortex ; PRP immediately understood DT NN and its uses . Stevo evidently worked out a deal with your elemental room mate to let PRP reassemble DT 108 and keep PRP VBG for three months , if PRP 're willing . He promised not to interfere during DT NN while he evaluates PRP . PRP had an awful lot of fun in DT chat session , by DT way . Francie 's past exposure to Jesuits at college in Georgetown produced some Jesuit predators in a murder ritual , which PRP RB dealt with in DT session . I had a notion to ' offer ' these child - murderers to DT elemental on your property as a gift and Stevo VBD he accepted . PRP expressed our love to DT elemental who DT psychics VBD was very surprised to find Westerners who honored him / her / PRP . PRP operate on DT assumption IN elementals are neither good nor bad but are certainly essential to all DT workings of our NN . This is unspeakably weird to mainstream folks but when PRP is willing to loose DT shackles of conventionality PRP 's a whole lot of fun and RB empowering to interact with elementals , most of whom love orgonite , after all . Your situation reminded me of DT big elementals Carol and I encountered on Andros Island in DT Bahamas , where PRP went to gift DT blue holes . DT Bahamians on DT island have gotten pretty far from their African roots and are quite churchified , so PRP seem to hate and fear DT elementals RB . Carol immediately got DT impression IN PRP hated NNS on account of PRP but as soon as PRP started tossing orgonite out into DT very dense bush for them , then into DT blue holes over DT next few days . I heard them as galloping horses , which did n't surprise me even though PRP can't penetrate more than a few inches into DT jungle without a bulldozer and PRP were obviously very happy IN some NNS finally acknowledged them . I VBP DT orgonite RB toned down DT churchy NNS 's paranoia about these nature guardians , too . Your case is absolutely unique , Dan , but I encourage PRP to avoid making assumptions about DT devices and will rather consider DT more hidden dynamics . PRP VBP to help PRP resolve this . I VBP IN if DT problem were rather with DT technology then we'd have heard reports IN this from other stable and reputable NNS but PRP 're DT only NN so EX 's obviously something else VBG on . Kelly did a great job identifying DT source of your previous trouble and PRP might be useful for PRP to VB acquainted with some traditional magicians on Bali if DT opportunity arises . If DT old ways on Bali were not valid I doubt DT NNS MD have kept those traditions into modern times and I VBP to honor NNS who do DT . EX are a few other cultures around DT NN who have achieved this . DT Black Caribs ( Garifuna ) of Central America are CD and I found them quite endearing . EX are lots of them in Africa and rural Asia where Big Religion clergy have n't bludgeoned NNS into superstition and paranoia about natural forces . A witch doctor in DT mountains of North Thailand sent an emissary to VB instructions for making orgonite from Eddie - san when he was vacationing RB a few NNS ago . PRP didnt ' VB each other and as far as I VBP Eddie has n't gotten any followup . I had DT opportunity to receive a lot of similar stories / teachings from Dorothy DT Witch , who was CD of a 3,000 NN family line of witches from Wales and perhaps a longer line of medicine NNS from DT Seneca tribe . She has travelled to over 40 NNS in a synchronous way and was sought out by members of ancient , benevolent secret orders in most of those . PRP MD learn a lot about synchronicity from folks IN these if PRP 're fortunate enough to VB them . A group of kindly witches gave protection to Carol and her associates when PRP arrived in rural Kenya 8 NNS ago and I believe if PRP were n't for DT , DT malevolent ' night runners ' MD have harmed CD or more of them , then . This is DT hidden NN which orgonite suits PRP to behold and appreciate if PRP 'll open ourselves to PRP . Some of PRP need to abandon certain prejudices in order to venture RB , of course . ~ Don , Dan , PRP 're still in DT exploratory phase with this device and I 'm kind of proud of DT way NNS are not getting carried away with blind imitation .

I VBP PRP 've come a long way and PRP makes me very proud of everyone here . ~Don I didnt VBP to post about PRP prematurely , because VBG NN with observations often has its own dynamics , while temporarily disassembling DT 108 was intended to pace myself in DT process of understanding its possible interactions . RB , including DT 108 in DT reduction of possible outside influences  to check if all this was interference or perhaps some personal process  was a reluctant thing for me to do , for I was so curious about its possible effects in dissolving negative thoughtforms , as reported by Carol . Then Francie emailed an observation WDT swept me in doubt about DT corruption resistance of a 108 and made me decide to temporarily remove PRP . I better post part of her email here as a quote , to not loose words in translation . I can already see some occult geometry being put over your location .... I looked and saw this geometry again last night . As I approached DT geometry PRP flashed and I saw bloody bulls ' horns and spring / early summer fields . I VBP DT was DT NN of this spell being made . I VBP biodynamic farmers still use DT NN of DT horns in their fields . What I saw over PRP MD be a corruption of this very old abundance / growth / fulfillment power ritual . In previous observations , Francie and Bob had seen my sleep deprivations derive from astral projections during sleep . Part of me had been flying in DT 108 vortex and somehow been captured , by DT spell and my own lack of grounding ( thus DT fear of VBG to sleep ) . Things felt a 100 % better and back to normal after Francie had removed this geometric overlay . But DT left me in doubt whether this MD happen again , as PRP perhaps can understand . Anyhow , all this kick - started a serious commitment to exploring my own habits of thought and disciplining myself into more positive NN . As I VBD in DT bugs post , PRP reminded me of experiencing George Orwells room 101 ( 1984  ) , where NNS are tortured with their own fears until PRP give up their concept of reality . After disassembling DT 108 , DT only outside influence left was my detox program . I need to add this and risk more controversy  for this detox had a profound effect on my tendency to VB in negative circles . PRP convinced me IN parasites have a role in maintaining negative thoughtforms , for which PRP blame our character . My 108 is up again . I feel strong enough to take more occult spells to test if PRP really can corrupt a 108s NN or see if I can manage myself now . As for DT interaction , both Francie and Dooney saw my 108 more grounded now . Maybe its all part of a personal process , who knows ? This etheric NN leaves me flabbergasted all DT NN . But thoughtforms seem to be very real ! Now I am curious how much happiness I can take Dan , I have to back PRP up to some extend  DT is , Ive RB disassembled my 108 for a few weeks . Mainly because , at some point , EX was too much VBG on ( as posted here and here ) for me to discern what caused what . Especially DT thought - manifestation occurrences confused me . Believe me , DT amount of bugs manifesting was not funny and I felt IN a wicked witch for DT way my negative thoughts became instant reality to NNS around me . So , besides disassembling DT 108 I RB disconnected every SP and other possible thought - enhancing equipment in DT house  to gradually build things up again , CD by CD , and see what MD happen . I didnt VBP to post about PRP prematurely , because VBG NN with observations often has its own dynamics , while temporarily disassembling DT 108 was intended to pace myself in DT process of understanding its possible interactions . RB , including DT 108 in DT reduction of possible outside influences  to check if all this was interference or perhaps some personal process  was a reluctant thing for me to do , for I was so curious about its possible effects in dissolving negative thoughtforms , as reported by Carol . Then Francie emailed an observation WDT swept me in doubt about DT corruption resistance of a 108 and made me decide to temporarily remove PRP . I better post part of her email here as a quote , to not loose words in translation . In previous observations , Francie and Bob had seen my sleep deprivations derive from astral projections during sleep . Part of me had been flying in DT 108 vortex and somehow been captured , by DT spell and my own lack of grounding ( thus DT fear of VBG to sleep ) . Things felt a 100 % better and back to normal after Francie had removed this geometric overlay . But DT left me in doubt whether this MD happen again , as PRP perhaps can understand . Anyhow , all this kick - started a serious commitment to exploring my own habits of thought and disciplining myself into more positive NN .

When I first released projections of 10,000 deaths in America by NNP 10th , nearly everyone thought DT idea was insane ( probably including PRP ) . As PRP turns out , PRP are likely to have over 100,000 deaths by NNP 10th , according to what DT White House is now saying . This is worth mentioning because today PRP have a JJ warning about where things are headed . EX have been three unmistakable signs IN war is coming to DT NNP NNPS very soon . Those signs have all emerged in DT past week , all with a sense of urgency WDT goes far beyond any concern about a pandemic : Sign # 1 ) NNP NNP activating CD million military reservists with JJ skills to treat battlefield injuries . Details of this order are found in DT EO text at WhiteHouse.gov . Sign # 2 ) DT Pentagon ordering high - level staffers into deep underground bunkers in Colorado . This was announced by NORAD and NORTHCOM in a Facebook town hall meeting . Obviously , PRP do n’t order military staffers into a 2,000 - foot deep bunker just because of a NN . Sign # 3 ) Secretary of NNP Pompeo just ordered all Americans living overseas to return to DT NNP “ immediately . ” DT cover story for this is IN DT NN is collapsing international flights . But DT alone MD not justify all Americans returning from living overseas , since JJ Americans MD just hunker down where PRP ’re living . But Pompeo wants all Americans to return immediately , which is DT kind of thing PRP do before a war breaks out ( with NNP , most likely ) . Via DT UK Independent : Secretary of NNP Mike Pompeo urged Americans abroad who still wish to return to DT NNP NNPS to do so “ immediately , ” saying commercial and NN - chartered flights MD soon cease amid DT NN outbreak . Donald NNP ’s top diplomat urged any Americans abroad who VBP to VB back to NNP soil to contact DT American embassy in DT country where PRP currently are to begin making plans “ immediately ” to VB a flight back to DT NNPS . DT ’s because Pompeo does n’t VB to end up negotiating for DT release of American prisoners being held by DT communist Chinese regime , obviously . Any American reading this who is still in NNP or Hong Kong should strongly consider bugging out . By DT way , PRP were RB told weeks ago from another source IN NNP has already begun executing anti-communist leaders in Hong Kong , which now seems to be preparation for DT JJ war WDT ’s about to happen next . These three events are unmistakable signs WDT high - level officials within DT Pentagon and NNP NNP Department anticipate actions of war in DT very near future . NNP is DT most likely adversary , especially given IN NNP probably released DT Wuhan NN in DT first place , knowing IN America MD have a much more difficult NN locking down cities compared to NNP itself , which PRP now believe MD have lost millions of citizens despite its best efforts to contain DT NN . Notably , DT Wuhan NN , released by NNP , has managed to cripple DT NNP Navy by infecting sailors on aircraft carriers and other vessels . This is not an accident . PRP ’s part of DT “ softening up ” phase to weaken America in advance of DT attack . Expect an attack on America when DT nation reaches “ peak pandemic ” NN chaos and JJ disruptions DT ideal NN for a foreign enemy to attack DT NNP NNPS MD be when our nation is in DT throes of JJ collapse and a pandemic JJ emergency . According to estimates announced by DT White House today , NN - related deaths will peak in DT USA on April 12th , but lockdowns will continue through DT end of April , causing financial reverberations to echo across DT nation for JJ months yet to come . DT White House currently expects up to 240,000 Americans to die from DT NN over DT next several months . ( Our own estimates top out at just 90,000 fatalities , by DT way . ) Due to DT NN crunch , joblessness , homelessness and rising social unrest will sow chaos across DT landscape of America for DT remainder of DT NN ( and well into 2021 ) , and DT does n’t even count whatever political chaos might be added to DT mix surrounding DT coming November elections . Plus , EX are food shortages WDT are starting to become very real , while a massive wave of price inflation for consumer goods will appear soon thanks to DT trillions of dollars in bailout money WDT NNP and DT Fed just threw at DT economy . With CD - third of DT NNP Congress now run by communist NNP — and most of DT left - wing NN making excuses for NNP and trying to shift DT NN blame to NNP — PRP ’s clear IN NNP ’s longstanding desire to infiltrate and destroy DT NNP NNPS of America has reached a tipping point . PRP will likely pull DT trigger soon , which MD mean JJ warfare ( selling all NNP debt and announcing a JJ gold - backed NN reserve currency ) , kinetic warfare ( an actual land invasion of Chinese troops hitting DT beaches in California ) , nuclear warfare ( or an EMP weapon detonated above North America ) , or even JJ waves of biological warfare ( SARS - cov - 3 , SARS - cov - 4 , etc. ) . And do n’t forget cyber warfare , a favorite of DT tech - savvy communist regime . PRP do n’t VB exactly what ’s coming , but PRP VBP DT leadership in America believes something big is about to happen . Otherwise , none of DT actions listed above MD have been taken . Ramp up your preparedness to a whole JJ level , if PRP can Prepare for all DT following , just in case CD or more happen : • A blackout of all internet and phone communications • Foreign troops invading DT NNP , including through DT Mexico border • Attempted assassination of NNP NNP , or a possible “ civil war ” inside DT Pentagon • DT possibility of mass arrests of deep NN traitors who are Chinese collaborators , such as Sen. Feinstein , Gov. Newsom , etc . PRP cannot be certain IN any of these will happen , and PRP hope none of them do . But EX are giant red flashing warning signs just screaming out IN something big is about to VB down . DT only two scenarios WDT make sense are a WAR with a foreign enemy or possibly DT initiation of a domestic civil war ( or perhaps both ) . If PRP thought encountering a purchase limit on toilet paper was DT worst problem PRP might encounter this NN , VB again . JR Nyquist explains why NNP is just itching to destroy DT NNP NNPS and has long been planning to use a biological weapon to soften up America in advance of DT military attack wave : Share everywhere , and feel free to re-post this video to your YouTube channel :"

Set to DT emotional song PRP ’ll Never Walk Alone , DT ad depicts DT premature sexualization of NNS as a wholesome family activity . Here are some of DT key scenes : DT fact IN PRP see this woman tightly strapping on this undergarment as emotional music plays in DT background is odd . CD of DT JJ reasons this is odd : Binding breasts leads to important NN risks . Binding for extended periods of NN can lead to rashes or yeast infections under DT breasts , back or chest pain , shortness of breath , overheating , or fractured ribs . Unsafe binding MD lead to permanent deformation of DT breasts , scarring , and lung constriction and long - term binding MD adversely affect DT outcome of a future mastectomy . In CD NN , 97.2 % of those surveyed had some sort of NN problem caused by binding . – Wikipedia , “ Binding ” In another scene , EX is more body - tightening VBG on . In DT 20th century , corsets were deemed dangerous and “ instruments of female torture ” . This ad is not merely about “ pride ” or “ diversity ” , PRP is about pushing an agenda . PRP is about involving minors in PRP and shaming parents who do not actively VB involved in PRP . An Agenda is Being Pushed DT gender - blurring agenda has been identified on this site several NNS ago and PRP keeps getting stronger . PRP VBP IN EX ’s an “ agenda ” ( which means “ an underlying often ideological plan or program ” ) VBG on because : • PRP is over - represented in mass NN • PRP is pushed by powerful actors • PRP targets minors ( and their parents ) intentionally . Here are some recent examples : If PRP believe IN JJ corporations such as Coca - Cola create social ads because “ PRP care ” , PRP are dead wrong . PRP do n’t . PRP are pushing an agenda WDT was precisely calculated and thought - out by powerful NN tanks to shape and mold a JJ generation . What PRP are actually looking for is confusion , anxiety , insecurity and a general feeling of disconnection towards everything WDT is real . And PRP are succeeding . P.S.

According to DT American Patriot website GrayChampion . Com , by Joe Stack ’s piloting his plane into DT Echelon Federal Building this past week he “ has fired DT first shot in DT NNP American Revolution . ” “ Gray Champion ’s are RB those rarest of Americans , arising to stand among their fellow citizens to “ do their duty ” on an average of once or twice every generation …. a NN WDT has come , once again , as DT future of DT NNP NNPS hangs in DT balance . DT true determination of who can be called a Gray Champion rests with history as these rarest of Americans were during their times , and by DT actions PRP performed , were always labeled as terrorists , rebels , murderers and traitors and held up for scorn by DT elite classes , NN officials and NN barons who were DT targets of these Gray Champions in DT first place . ” In our previous report about DT actions of Joe Stack ( and actually when PRP had first heard of DT American moniker “ Gray Champion ” ) to strike back against a NN he believed no longer served DT true interests of its citizens , PRP quoted from his “ manifesto ” delivered to DT NNP upon his death , and wherein he VBD : “ I can only hope IN DT numbers quickly VBP too big to be white washed and ignored IN DT American zombies wake up and revolt ; PRP will take nothing less . I MD only hope IN by striking a nerve WDT stimulates DT inevitable double standard , knee - jerk NN reaction WDT results in more stupid draconian restrictions NNS wake up and begin to see DT pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what PRP are . Sadly , though I spent my entire life trying to believe PRP was n’t so , but violence not only is DT answer , PRP is DT only answer . DT cruel joke is IN DT really big chunks of shit at DT top have known this all along and have been laughing , at and using this awareness against , fools IN me all along . ” To DT fears of Joe Stack and his fellow American citizens of their living in a country whose NN no longer serves them , but in chilling fact sees them all as enemies and has begun targeting them for destruction , DT evidence is becoming overwhelming , and as PRP can read : As reported by DT ABC Television NNP Service in their February 3rd article titled “ License to Kill ? Intelligence Chief Says U.S. Can Take Out American Terrorists ” PRP report : “ DT director of national intelligence affirmed rather bluntly today IN DT U.S. intelligence community has authority to target American citizens for assassination if PRP present a direct terrorist threat to DT NNP NNPS . “ PRP take direct actions against terrorists in DT intelligence community ; if … PRP VBP IN direct action will involve killing an American , PRP VBP specific permission to do DT , ” Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told DT House Intelligence Committee . ” Based upon NNP Intelligence Director Blair ’s testimony to Congress , and should DT American NN had discovered Joe Stack ’s plan to attack DT Echelon Federal Building in Texas , PRP had DT right to assassinate him instead of arresting him and bringing him to trial , and which flies in DT face of every standard DT NNP NNPS was built upon , not to mention its being against their own laws and Constitution . And PRP gets worse … In a just released report ( February 19th ) titled “ Bush Lawyer VBN NNP MD Order Civilians to Be ' Massacred ' ” by DT American NN magazine Newsweek PRP is VBN : “ DT chief author of DT Bush administration 's "" torture memo ” told Justice Department investigators IN DT NN 's war - making authority was so broad IN he had DT constitutional power to order a village to be "" massacred ” , according to a report by released Friday night by DT Office of Professional Responsibility . ” To those Americans believing IN their NN MD never result to DT wholesale massacring of them PRP are warned to VB twice , especially when viewed in DT light of a just released article by DT NNP Newswire Service titled “ 1,000 Architects & Engineers Call for NNP 9/11 Investigation ” and which , in part , says : “ Richard Gage , AIA , architect and founder of DT non-profit Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth , Inc. ( AE911 Truth ) , will announce a decisive milestone today at a press conference in San Francisco , as more than 1,000 worldwide architects and engineers now support DT call for a JJ investigation into DT destruction of DT Twin Towers and Building 7 at DT NNP Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 . After careful examination of DT official explanation , along with DT forensic data omitted from official reports , these professionals have concluded IN a JJ independent investigation into these mysterious collapses is needed . Gage and his group base their conclusions on forensic evidence . Gage VBZ , "" DT official FEMA and NIST reports provide insufficient , contradictory , and fraudulent accounts of DT circumstances of DT towers ' destruction . PRP are therefore calling for a grand jury investigation of NIST officials . Gage points out DT destruction of DT third high - rise , NNP Trade Center 7 , a 47 - story skyscraper which was not hit by an aircraft , yet came down in pure free - fall acceleration for more than 100 feet , a significant fact WDT NIST has been forced to admit , due to research conducted by AE911 Truth petition signers . Other disturbing facts emerging from DT forensic evidence include : Complete destruction of both Twin Towers in just 10 to 14 seconds at near free - fall acceleration Over 100 first - responder reports of explosions and flashes at onset of destruction 1200 - foot - dia . debris field : no "" pancaked "" floors seen in DT debris pile Several tons of molten metal found in debris . Evidence of advanced explosive nano - thermitic composite material found in DT WTC dust by an international team of NNS ” Even worse for these Americans are those still believing IN NNP Obama is VBG to protect them , but which all DT evidence clearly shows he is not VBG to do , in fact , since taking office he has not only continued all of DT former NNP Bush ’s policies , he is now actively involved in protecting from prosecution DT Bush Administration “ architects ” of DT JJ Fascist NN being created in DT NNP NNPS along with continuing DT cover -up of DT events surrounding 9/11 , and as PRP can read : As reported by DT Associated Press NNP Service in their article titled “ DOJ review finds no misconduct by memo authors ” , Obama overruled his own Department of Justice lawyers who wanted DT Bush Administration authors of DT so called “ torture memos ” prosecuted and has allowed them to VB unpunished , and as PRP can read : “ An initial review by DT Justice Department 's internal affairs unit found IN former [ Bush ] NN lawyers Jay Bybee and John Yoo had committed professional misconduct , a conclusion WDT MD have cost them their law licenses . But , underscoring just how controversial and legally thorny DT memos have become , DT Justice Department 's top career lawyer [ and close Obama friend ] reviewed DT matter and disagreed . ” Scarier still about Obama are JJ reports coming from DT NNP questioning weather he is even in control , and as PRP can read as reported by DT Salon . Com NN Service in their report titled “ Who 's in control in DT White House ? ” , and which , in part , says : “ Recall IN CD NN ago , Obama instructed DT DEA to follow his campaign pledge and respect local statutes legalizing medicinal marijuana . When DT DEA kept raiding pot dispensaries in NNS WDT had passed such laws , Attorney General Eric Holder reiterated DT cease and desist decree , stating IN "" What ( Obama ) VBD during DT campaign is now American policy . "" As even more raids nonetheless continued , DT Justice Department then issued an explicit memo ordering federal agents to refrain from prosecuting those who are in "" compliance with existing NN laws providing for DT JJ use of marijuana . "" And yet DT DEA has recently intensified its crackdown . Here in Colorado -- where voters enshrined JJ marijuana 's legality in our NN constitution -- DT feds not only raided two dispensaries , but did so in a way WDT deliberately humiliated their superiors . In January , DT DEA stormed a company WDT performs cannabis quality tests . DT firm ’s alleged infraction ? Following protocol and formally applying for a federal equipment license . DEA rogues responded to DT request not with thanks or -- heaven forbid -- approval , but instead with DT gestapo . This was topped last week when DEA agents arrested a JJ marijuana grower who dared discuss his business with a local NN outlet . Sensing a P.R. opportunity , DEA agent Jeffrey Sweetin used DT spectacle to insist IN he will not listen to stand - down directives from his bosses . ” Now most interesting about all of these events now occurring in DT NNP NNPS , including Joe Stack now being VBN to be CD of DT “ Gray Champions ” of his generation , is IN PRP have been predicted to occur , and as PRP can read as reported by DT Wall Street Journal NNP Service in their December 29 , 2008 article titled “ As if Things Were n't Bad Enough , Russian Professor Predicts End of U.S. ” , and which says : “ For a decade , Russian academic Igor Panarin has been predicting DT U.S. will fall apart in 2010 . For most of DT NN , he admits , few took his argument -- IN an JJ and moral collapse will trigger a civil war and DT eventual breakup of DT U.S. -- very seriously . Now he 's found an eager audience : Russian NN NN . In recent weeks , he 's been interviewed as much as twice a day about his predictions . "" PRP 's a record , "" says Prof. Panarin . "" But I VBP DT attention is VBG to grow even stronger . "" Prof. Panarin , 50 NNS old , is not a fringe figure . A former KGB analyst , he is dean of DT Russian Foreign Ministry 's academy for future diplomats . He is invited to Kremlin receptions , lectures students , publishes books , and appears in DT NN as an expert on U.S. - Russia relations . But it's his bleak forecast for DT U.S. WDT is music to DT ears of DT Kremlin , which in recent NNS has blamed Washington for everything from instability in DT Middle East to DT JJ financial crisis . Mr. Panarin's views RB fit neatly with DT Kremlin 's narrative IN Russia is returning to its rightful place on DT NN stage after DT weakness of DT 1990s , when JJ feared IN DT country MD VB economically and politically bankrupt and break into separate territories . A polite and cheerful man with a buzz cut , Mr. Panarin insists he does not dislike Americans . But he warns IN DT outlook for them is dire . "" EX 's a 55 - 45 % chance right now IN disintegration will occur , "" he says . "" PRP MD rejoice in DT process , "" he adds , poker - faced . "" But if PRP 're talking reasonably , PRP 's not DT best scenario -- for Russia . "" Though Russia MD become more powerful on DT JJ stage , he says , its economy MD suffer because PRP currently depends heavily on DT dollar and on trade with DT U.S . Mr. Panarin posits , in brief , IN mass immigration , JJ decline , and moral degradation will trigger a civil war next fall and DT collapse of DT dollar . Around DT end of June 2010 , or early July , he says , DT U.S. will break into six pieces -- with Alaska reverting to Russian control . ” In these most darkest of times , and as DT fate of America now hangs in DT balance , PRP can only hope IN her NNS will awaken , and in their awakening arise together , as DT CD NNS WDT PRP are , so IN when DT history of these times are written , and though JJ of them will become their own “ Gray Champions ” , a JJ and better Nation MD be born again . © February 20 , 2010 EU and NNP all rights reserved [ Ed .

In Canada , a two - legged dog jogged down DT beach as if PRP were a human . Our sense of what is possible is expanding every day – MD DT cryptids , those legendary monsters of folklore , have more grounding in scientific fact than previously assumed ? Probably not . But PRP ’s April Fools ’ Day , and DT means PRP can have just as much fun fooling ourselves as PRP do other NNS . After all , DT NN is a more interesting place with these creatures in PRP . Join PRP below as PRP explore DT most intriguing cryptid sightings of 2014 – if PRP ’re real , might PRP be hiding in your backyard ? DT legend of DT Chupacabra – a bloodsucking monster WDT preys on livestock – continues to haunt DT Southwest , most recently in March , when a Texas family claimed to have shot and killed a real Chupacabra . With its terrifying teeth and unholy grimace , DT animal ’s corpse certainly fits DT Chupcabra ’s description , but local authorities , their hearts dead to DT magic of DT West , say DT creature was likely a local predator infected by Sarcoptic mange . Bigfoot enthusiasts received a disappointing blow to their efforts on March 28 , when self - proclaimed “ best Bigfoot tracker in DT NN ” Rick Dyer admitted IN his two - NN publicity campaign to convince DT NN he ’d killed DT beast was a lie . This was DT second NN Dyer admitted to lying about killing DT legendary monster , which raises DT question of why anyone trusted him in DT first place . Still , Bigfoot claims are IN DT Hydra : Knock CD down and another three grow in its place . 2014 has already seen Bigfoot sightings in Detroit , Vermont and Maine . As PRP MD guess from its delightfully folksy moniker , DT Yowie is DT Australian analogue to Bigfoot , a gigantic hominid rumored to hide in DT Australian bush . Given Australia ’s remarkable biodiversity and relatively low population density , DT Yowie might be slightly easier to believe in than its American relative , particularly among DT numerous travelers who have recently reported seeing PRP in DT NNP South Wales outback . NN theorist David Icke has popularized DT theory IN several NN leaders are actually reptilians in disguise , but less cynical cryptid fans have reported seeing lizard NNS wandering DT wilderness in their natural skin , far from DT corridors of power . Typical is this account from February , in which a trio of bikers reported encountering a six - foot - tall reptile with clawed hands and snake eyes while traveling through DT Arizona desert . “ When PRP read these stories online or watch them on TV , PRP VBP , ‘ Man , these NNS are crazy , or on meds or something , ' ” CryptoZoologyNews.com quoted CD of DT bikers as saying . “ This story has made me a believer . ” What ’s Portugese for “ spooky - scary ? ” DT Brazilian Internet blew up in February after security footage of what appeared to be a terrifying wolf figure , complete with tales of frightened locals and security lockdowns , went viral . DT rumors were finally stopped by DT Internet equivalent of a silver bullet : A few skeptical sleuths , who noticed IN DT video dated back to at least 2007 . Officials in DT town reportedly terrorized by DT werewolf VBD PRP had no knowledge of any such creature – of course , DT ’s what PRP MD say . If a body of NN is large enough and deep enough , eventually NNS are VBG to start worrying EX are monsters in PRP . DT most recent rumblings come from Russia , where a team of NNS has been studying Siberia ’s Lake Labynkyr , hoping to find evidence of a mysterious NN creature WDT fascinated DT NN in 2013 . ( Initial reports IN those divers found a large jawbone at DT bottom of DT lake have not been confirmed . ) Meanwhile in Scotland , longtime Loch Ness watchers are puzzled at DT lack of sightings of their own aquatic monster – EX have been no reports of “ Nessie ” in a NN and a half , for DT first NN since 1925 .

DT discovery of Morgan ’s sphinx moth , which had a tongue just long enough ( and no longer ) , proved Darwin right — some two decades after his death . PRP ’s CD of DT great demonstrations of evolution by natural selection . But what naturalists really VBP is to catch natural selection in DT act , as PRP ’s doing DT selecting . DT ’s much harder , and a bit of luck is needed . Opportunity knocked at DT door of biologist Colin Donihue at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , a NN ago , just after he and his colleagues had returned from Pine Cay and NNP Cay , two small islands in DT Turks and Caicos archipelago to DT north of DT Caribbean , where PRP had been studying DT lives and times of its resident anole lizards ( Anolis scriptus ) . On 8 September last NN , Hurricane Irma struck DT islands , battering them with sustained winds of up to 265 kilometres per hour . Irma was DT first category - 5 hurricane on record to strike DT region , but more was to come : two weeks later , Hurricane Maria swept across DT islands with winds of up to 200 kilometres per hour . Dozens of NNS in DT region died . Reconstruction and rebuilding efforts continue . Read DT paper : Hurricane - induced selection on DT morphology of an island lizard Three weeks after DT winds had died down , DT researchers were back on Pine Cay and NNP Cay to assess DT damage , and to see how ( or even if ) their lizards had survived . Their NN , published this week in Nature , is DT first to use an immediate before - and - after comparison to assess DT impacts of hurricanes on evolutionary selection ( C. M. Donihue et al . Nature http://doi.org/csgp; 2018 ) . Serendipity can VB only so far . DT researchers had n’t marked DT lizards , so PRP MD n’t identify and track DT fate of individuals . But PRP found clear trends of natural selection in action . In general , anoles found after DT storms had bigger toepads , longer forelimbs and shorter hindlimbs than did lizards collected before DT storm . What have these traits to do with hurricanes ? DT lizards live in bushes and other low - growing vegetation . Toepads allow them purchase on DT branches as PRP move , and PRP ’s a fair bet IN limb proportions RB play a part in helping a lizard to keep in contact with a branch , resisting moves by predators , other lizards — or , as PRP turned out , hurricanes — to knock them off . DT researchers took their idea further with a simple laboratory experiment , in which PRP allowed lizards to VB settled on a perch and then blew them off using a commercial leaf blower , recording DT speed at which DT lizards were dislodged . ( DT lizards flew into comfy padding , and were not injured in DT experiments . ) This experiment supported DT researchers ’ hypothesis . In particular , PRP showed IN when lizards are subjected to a stiff breeze , PRP hang on tightly with their forelimbs and let their hindlimbs hang loose . Longer hindlimbs , then , offer more purchase to DT winds , explaining why lizards found after DT storms tended to have shorter hindlimbs , but longer forelimbs . These bigger toepads , shorter hindlimbs and longer forelimbs did not evolve as a direct response to DT hurricanes , but PRP show how such evolution occurs . Natural selection interfered with DT way in which these traits were spread across DT population . Specifically , those lizards unable to hang on when DT storms blew up — those with smaller toepads , longer hindlimbs and shorter forelimbs — were ( presumably ) blown away and perished . Those lizards better able to hang on tightly MD have survived to weather another day . In technical terms , DT mean values of DT crucial traits measured before DT storms had shifted . These changes are phenotypic — merely observable characteristics . PRP say nothing about DT genetic assimilation of such changes , which will presumably happen when DT surviving lizards breed and JJ lizards are recruited to DT population . Such changes are unlikely to be DT last , given DT expected increases in extreme weather WDT DT future will bring ."

Of what possible threat MD honest , scientific discovery pose to national security or DT common good ? Yet , this is exactly what happened when American diggers found skeletal remains of oversize humans : giants . Disclose.tv reported earlier this NN on a story WDT was ridiculed and debunked as soon as PRP was made JJ some decades ago : IN DT Smithsonian Institution destroyed thousands of giant human skeletons . DT NNP NNP Daily Report was DT first publication to claim IN DT NNP cover - up of giant human remains began in DT early 1900s . ( PRP is entirely possible IN earlier NNS will be found , in DT future . ) This leading scientific organization responded to allegations of their deceitful actions by filing a lawsuit to protect their sterling reputation . DT Event Chronicle fills in DT details : “ A NNP Supreme Court ruling has forced DT Smithsonian institution to release classified papers dating from DT early 1900 ’s WDT proves DT organization was involved in a major historical cover - up of evidence showing giants human remains in DT tens of thousands had been uncovered all across America and were ordered to be destroyed by high - level administrators to protect DT mainstream chronology of human evolution at DT NN . “ DT allegations stemming from DT American Institution of Alternative Archeology ( AIAA ) WDT DT Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousands of giant human remains during DT early 1900 ’s was not taken lightly by DT Smithsonian who responded by suing DT organization for defamation and trying to damage DT reputation of DT 168 - NN old institution . “ … Smithsonian whistle blowers admitted to DT existence of documents WDT allegedly proved DT destruction of tens of thousands of human skeletons reaching between 6 feet and 12 feet in height , a reality mainstream archeology can not admit to for different reasons , claims AIAA spokesman , James Churward . ” Honestly , covering up DT existence of giants on NN , in order to preserve a theory WDT explains how humans came to inhabit North America , makes very little sense : who stands to gain , and who stands to lose ? MD PRP be IN DT NNP leadership decided IN DT citizenry MD freak out from DT NN of giants who lived in DT distant past ? DT Bible ( Genesis 6:4 ) VBZ very matter - of - factly : “ EX were giants in DT NNP in those days ” – as if contemporary readers knew this to be true , undoubtedly from DT passage of oral tradition . Great warriors IN Goliath ( bested by David and his sling ) were described , and DT locations of giants ’ kingdoms were disclosed . JJ other civilizations around DT NN have “ myths ” about giants , as listed in this fascinating article by an unnamed author . American immigrants brought their cultural heritages with them . But a folk tale is a far cry from scientific rigor . So why DT modern cover - up of actual physical evidence WDT supports those “ NNS ’s stories ? ” CD mundane explanation MD be IN influential ( as in , wealthy ) , mainstream archaeologists wanted to maintain their scientific supremacy , and persuaded DT federal NN to help perpetuate DT lie IN giants never existed anywhere in DT NN , much less in DT continental NNP . After all , schools taught IN DT earliest American inhabitants trekked over a Bering Strait land bridge – over DT north pole , nearly – into modern - day Alaska a mere 15,000 NNS ago . Perhaps DT scientific community “ needed to be right ? ” Fortunately for PRP DT NNPS , with DT age of DT internet and instant , JJ communication DT Truth is becoming harder and harder to hide . In this century , DT oldest human fossils – not gigantic , by DT way – have been found in northern Africa ( Jebel Irhoud , Morocco ) . These remains date to around 315,000 NNS old , as DT Atlantic Daily , Nature , and other scientific publications have reported ! Archaeological discoveries keep pushing DT date of human ( homo sapiens sapiens , DT is ) origin further and further back in NN . These dates happen to jive with ancient source texts WDT discuss human origin , notably DT Sumerian clay tablets translated by Zecharia Sitchin . This Azerbaijani - born American researcher and author upset DT anthropological NN with his revelation IN humans had been bred by an off - NN race called DT Annunaki – “ alien overlords ” ( in this case , DT term actually does fit ) – to serve them , especially to mine gold in DT hot African sun . Just as DT Bible later described , DT Annunaki – or “ fallen angels ” – bred with human women and birthed …a race of giants called DT Nephilim . DT giants had big appetites , and devoured all DT crops and livestock before turning to humans as their next food source . At this point , DT Annunaki admitted IN DT Nephilim had gotten out of hand , and flooded DT NN as a JJ Mulligan ( “ do - over ” ) – kind of IN shaking an Etch - a - Sketch upside down in order to “ clean DT slate . ” Now , this is where DT NN about giants gets interesting . Sitchin ’s work continues to be refuted by “ experts , ” even as more archaeological evidence of beings with elongated skulls , giants and ancient African gold mines inhabited by early humans continues to pile up . Is DT NNP NNP Order actually threatened by a citizenry WDT is fully aware of our alien - hybridized human origin ? If NNS , collectively , understood IN PRP were created to serve ETs ( termed “ gods ” in ancient texts ) , how MD DT VB our society and others around DT NN ? Ignoring DT Illuminati agenda , alternative NN sources continue to report similar “ gigantic ” findings from around DT NN . To cite just a couple : “ Nephilim Bones and Giant Human Skeletons in Greece ” and “ Skeletons of 5,000 - NN - old Chinese ‘ giants ’ discovered by archaeologists . ” Regardless of DT “ why ” behind yet another NN discovery / lie / cover - up , PRP is clear IN , in those days , yeah – EX really were giants ."

For JJ NNS , this is DT dreariest NN of DT NN . But for a small niche of NN - happy athletes , winter is a NN to play , as ferocious storms send rippling rings of NN outward through DT ocean . By DT NN PRP reach distant shores , these swells have matured into clean , polished waves WDT barrel in with a cold and ceaseless military rhythm ; PRP touch bottom , slow , build and , finally , collapse in spectacular curls and thundering white NN . These are DT things of dreams for surfers , JJ of whom travel DT NN , pursuing giant breakers . And surfers are n’t DT only ones with their eyes on DT NN — for surfing has become a popular spectator sport . At JJ famed breaks , bluffs on DT shore provide fans with thrilling views of DT action . DT waves alone are awesome — so powerful PRP MD seem to shake DT NN . But when a tiny human figure on a board as flimsy as a matchstick appears on DT face of DT incoming giant , zigzagging forward as DT wave curls overhead and threatens to crush him , spines tingle , hands come together in prayer , and jaws drop . Whether PRP VBP DT NN or not , big - wave surfing is CD of DT most thrilling shows on DT NN . DT birth of big - wave surfing was an incremental process WDT began in DT 1930s and ’ 40s in Hawaii , especially along DT north - facing shores of DT islands . Here , 15 - foot waves were once considered giants , and anything much bigger just eye candy . But wave at a NN , surfers stoked up their courage and ambition . PRP surfed on bigger days , used lighter and lighter boards WDT allowed swifter paddling and hunted for breaks WDT consistently produced monsters . CD by CD , big - wave spots were cataloged , named and ranked , and wave at a NN , records were set . In November 1957 , big - wave pioneer Greg Noll rode an estimated 25 - footer in Waimea Bay , Oahu . In 1969 , Noll surfed what was probably a 30 - plus - footer , but no verified photos exist of DT wave , and thus no means of determining its height . Fast - forwarding a few decades , Mike Parsons caught a 66 - foot breaker in 2001 at Cortes Bank , 115 miles off San Diego , where a seamount rises to within three feet of DT surface . In 2008 , Parsons was back at DT same place and caught a 77 - footer . But Garrett McNamara outdid Parsons and set DT current record in November 2011 , when he rode a 78 - foot wave off DT coast of Portugal , at DT town of Nazare . But these later records MD not have been possible without DT assistance of jet skis , which have become a common and controversial element in DT pursuit of giant waves . DT vehicles first began appearing in DT surf during big - wave events in DT early 1990s , and for all their noise and stench , their appeal was undeniable : Jet skis made PRP possible to access waves 40 feet and bigger , and whose scale had previously been too grand for most unassisted surfers to reach by paddling . Though tow - in surfing has given a boost to DT record books , PRP has RB heightened DT danger of surfing , and JJ surfers have died in big waves PRP might never have attempted without jet - ski assistance . Not surprisingly , JJ surfers have rejected tow - in surfing as an affront to DT purity of their relationship with waves — and PRP still manage to catch monsters . In March 2011 , Shane Dorian rode a 57 - foot breaker at DT famed Jaws break in Maui , unassisted by a belching two - stroke engine . But JJ big - wave riders fully endorse tow - in surfing as a natural evolution of DT sport . Surfing supertstar Laird Hamilton has even blown off purists who continue to paddle after big waves without jet skis as “ moving backward . ” Anyway , in a sport WDT relies heavily on satellite imagery , Internet swell forecasts and red - eye flights to Honolulu , are PRP really complaining about a little high - tech assistance ? For those wishing merely to watch big waves and DT competitors WDT gather to ride them , all WDT is needed is a picnic blanket and binoculars — and perhaps some help from this swell forecast website . Following are some superb sites to watch surfers catch DT biggest breakers in DT NN this winter . Waimea Bay , North Shore of Oahu . Big - wave surfing was born here , largely fueled by DT fearless vision of Greg Noll in DT 1950s . DT definition of “ big ” for extreme surfers has grown since DT early days , yet Waimea still holds its own . Fifty - foot waves can occur here — events WDT chase all but DT best wave riders from DT NN . When conditions allow , elite surfers participate in DT recurring Quicksilver Eddie Aikau Invitational . Spectators teem on DT shore during big - swell periods , and while surfers MD fight for their ride , PRP MD have to fight for your view . VB RB early . Jaws , North Shore of Maui . RB known as Peahi , Jaws produces some of DT most feared and attractive waves on NN . DT break — where 50 - footers and bigger appear almost every NN — is almost strictly a tow - in site , but rebel paddle - by - hand surfers do business here , too . Twenty - CD pros have been invited to convene at Jaws this winter for a paddle - in competition sometime between December 7 and March 15 . Spectators are afforded a great view of DT action on a high nearby bluff . But VB early , as hundreds will be in line for DT best viewing points . RB , bring binoculars , as DT breakers crash almost a mile offshore . Mavericks , Half Moon Bay , California . Mavericks gained its reputation in DT 1980s and ’90s , during DT revival of big - wave surfing , which lost some popularity in DT 1970s . Named for a German Shepherd named Maverick who took a surgy swim here in 1961 , DT site ( which gained an “ s ” but never an official apostrophe ) generates some of DT biggest surfable waves in DT NN . Today , surfing competitions , IN DT Mavericks Big Wave Contest and DT Mavericks Invitational , are held each NN . DT waves of Mavericks crash on a vicious reef , making them predictable ( sandy bottoms will shift and VB DT wave form ) but nonetheless hazardous . CD of DT best surfers of his NN , Mark Foo died here in 1994 when his ankle leash is believed to have snagged on DT bottom . Later , DT waves claimed DT life of Hawaiian surfing star Sion Milosky . A high bluff above DT beach offers a view of DT action . As at Jaws , bring binoculars . Ghost Trees , Monterey Peninsula , California . This break hits peak form under DT same swell conditions WDT VBP things roaring at Mavericks , just a three - hour drive north . Ghost Trees is a relatively JJ attraction for big - wave riders . Veteran surfer Don Curry says he first saw PRP surfed in 1974 . Decades MD pass before PRP became famous , and before PRP killed pro surfer ( and a pioneer of nearby Mavericks ) Peter Davi in 2007 . For surfing spectators , EX are few places quite IN Ghost Trees . DT waves , which can hit 50 feet and more , break just a football field ’s length from shore . Mullaghmore Head , Ireland . Far from DT classic Pacific shores of big - wave legend and history , Mullaghmore Head comes alive during winter storms in DT North Atlantic . DT location produces waves big enough IN surfing here has become primarily a jet ski-assisted game . In fact , DT event period for DT Billabong Tow - In Session at Mullaghmore began on November 1 and will run through February 2013 . Just how big is Mullaghmore Head ? On March 8 , 2012 , DT waves here reached 50 feet , as determined by satellite measurements . A grassy headland provides an elevated platform from which to see DT show . Bundle up if PRP VBP , and expect cold , blustery conditions . Teahupoo , Tahiti . This coveted break blooms with big swells from DT Southern Ocean — usually during DT southern winter . Teahupoo is famed for its classic tube breakers . Shipsterns Bluff , Tasmania . Watch for this point ’s giants to break from June through September . Punta de Lobos , Chile . Channeling DT NN of DT Southern Ocean into huge but glassy curlers , Punta de Lobos breaks at its best in March and April . Todos Santos Island , Baja California , Mexico . Todos Santos Island features several well - known breaks , but “ Killers ” is DT biggest and baddest . DT surf usually peaks in DT northern winter . EX is another sort of wave WDT thrills tourists and spectators : DT tidal bore . These moon - induced phenomena occur with regularity at particular locations around DT NN . DT most spectacular to see include DT tidal bores of Hangzhou Bay , NNP , and Araguari , Brazil — each of which has become a popular surfing event ."

Joe is a mexicano who knew some of DT same Spanish folktales WDT Juan B. Rael had collected JJ NNS earlier in DT area around Antonito , Colorado . I found Joe in his store of “ collectables ” on Main Street . His store was a little community center where NNS from town dropped in to talk about DT NN of DT day . Joe is a lot IN his father , Anastacio , whose boot ‐making shop had RB become a little community center . Joe remembers sheepherders complaining to his father IN DT police had stolen their money . DT sheepherders came to town to collect their pay and VB on a bender . PRP deposited most of their money with DT cops who pocketed PRP for themselves and denied having received PRP . Anastacio was n't afraid of confronting DT cops . Joe 's dad was a valorista , or brave man of his word who defended DT weak against DT strong . Joe told me DT folktales he had learned from his parents and then nudged me in a different direction . He took me to his backyard shed , pulled out a dusty box of manuscripts he had written in long hand and asked me to read them . Joe liked to read western novels by Louis L'amour and emulated DT author 's style . CD of DT manuscripts was a story about Bigfoot . I knew about his interest in DT creature because he had shown PRP a video he and his son had taken of large footprints with an unusually long gait in DT snow south of town . Joe did not see DT creature WDT made them , and so he sought out others who had . Several had caught fleeting glimpses of something crossing Highway 285 in DT cut just across DT NNP Mexico border . A woodcutter VBD he found DT cave where Bigfoot lives . A rancher VBD he came face to face with DT creature in DT Hansen Creek area in DT San Juan Wilderness west of town . DT same rancher added IN JJ Bigfoot live in DT llano between two dormant volcanoes , Mt. San Antonio south of town and Ute Mountain to DT east . At first I did n't understand why a man IN Joe , who spent his life fighting for his raza MD care so much about proving DT existence of Bigfoot . Did n't DT creature come from mass NN , and were n't most enthusiasts white working class men on DT wrong side of DT Civil Rights struggle ? Joe has stood up for DT underdog his entire life . He worked as a business agent for DT union presenting grievances to DT Miner brothers who managed DT Perlite plant south of town . Joe VBD : “ PRP had my raza down in DT lower paying jobs sweeping and doing DT cleaning and all DT hard labor . Bud Miner hated to see me coming . He told me : ‘ I 'm tired of PRP Mexicans coming over here and trying to tell PRP what to do . ’ ” EX is a lot of chicanery connected with this North American wildman , and so I shied away from DT subject at first . Every NN PRP returned to Antonito , Joe told me he had found another person who had seen footprints or caught a fleeting glimpse of DT creature . An Anglo showed some photographs of footprints he had taken with his cell phone camera . PRP held two Bigfoot parties in our Antonito home with NNS whose testimonies Joe considered believable . PRP followed them up with interviews in their homes . Joe will talk to anyone who has seen Bigfoot . PRP does n't matter to him if PRP are Anglos or mexicanos . He knows from watching television IN Bigfoot researchers are mainly Anglos . Joe cobbled together what he learned from DT witnesses to write his story , which he says is “ pure fiction . ” DT central protagonist , Marc Gomez , is Joe 's idea of a mexicano everyman who has lost touch with his ancestors . Marc is 39 , just divorced from his wife , retired after 20 NNS in DT army , and is living in Los Angeles . He loves to read western paperback novels about NNP Mexico and is ready for a NN . He packs up his Air Stream trailer , hitches PRP to his Bronco , and heads toward DT Land of Enchantment . Marc , IN Joe himself , sets out on a quest to find Bigfoot after he dreamt of giant faceless creatures running after him on a forsaken prairie . He heads up Highway 285 and overhears , on his CB radio , a conversation between truckers CD of whom says : “ Some animal came out of DT bar pit . I 'm sure I hit PRP with my back wheels . Looked IN a bear or something big . ” Marc follows leads to an old mexicano sheepherder who lives in Velarde , NNP Mexico , who ran into DT creature on DT llano near Ute Mountain . DT sheepherder has a daughter , Cristina , and she becomes Marc 's lover and companion , and together PRP enter Bigfoot 's NN in DT volcanic caverns under DT llano . Marc and Cristina discover DT creature 's NN is IN DT of humans above DT llano . DT strong prey on DT weak in both places . Marc and Cristina show PRP are both valoristas by defending DT weaker Bigfoot from DT stronger ones who attempt to enslave them . Each witness PRP interviewed had a particular take on DT creature . PRP VBD he is peaceful , adapted , intelligent looking , strong , massive but graceful , and proud . Some say he is a loner , and others say he lives in families . Those with greater knowledge of DT environment speak with more authority . DT mexicanos I VBP tell and write stories about Bigfoot to claim their rightful place on a llano PRP share with others ."

This_DT article_NN was_VBD posted_VBN :_: Tuesday_NNP ,_, March_NNP 25_CD ,_, 2014_CD at_IN 6:16_CD am_NN","What MD Happen If A Giant Tsunami Hit Florida ? Can PRP imagine DT devastation WDT MD be caused if a massive wall of NN several hundred feet high slammed into Florida at more than 100 miles an hour ? To JJ NNS such a scenario is impossible , but DT is what NNS living along DT Indian Ocean thought before DT 2004 tsunami and DT is what NNS living in Japan thought before DT 2011 tsunami . Throughout history , giant tsunamis have been relatively rare events , but PRP do happen . NNS tell PRP IN a mega - tsunami can race across DT open ocean at up to 500 miles an hour , and when PRP reach shore PRP can produce waves WDT are hundreds of feet high . And even though authorities claim IN DT threat to Florida is “ remote ” , PRP might surprise PRP to learn IN EX are “ Tsunami Hazard Zone ” signs on Florida beaches . If a highly unusual event ( such as a giant meteor hitting DT Atlantic Ocean ) caused a giant tsunami WDT hit Florida , DT devastation MD be absolutely unimaginable . Most NNS do n’t realize this , but almost DT entire bottom half of Florida is just barely above NN level . If a giant tsunami did hit Florida , EX MD be nothing to stop PRP from sweeping across DT entire NN … South Florida has two big problems . DT first is its remarkably flat topography . Half DT area WDT surrounds Miami is less than five feet above NN level . Its highest natural elevation , a limestone ridge WDT runs from Palm Beach to just south of DT city , averages a scant 12 feet . With just three feet of NN - level rise , more than a third of southern Florida will vanish ; at six feet , more than half will be gone ; if DT seas rise 12 feet , South Florida will be little more than an isolated archipelago surrounded by abandoned buildings and crumbling overpasses . And DT waters wo n’t just come in from DT east – because DT region is so flat , rising seas will come in nearly as fast from DT west too , through DT Everglades . Even worse , South Florida sits above a vast and porous limestone plateau . “ Imagine Swiss cheese , and PRP ’ll have a pretty good idea what DT rock under southern Florida looks IN , ” says Glenn Landers , a senior engineer at DT U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . This means NN moves around easily – PRP seeps into yards at high tide , bubbles up on golf courses , flows through underground caverns , corrodes building foundations from below . “ Conventional NN walls and barriers are not effective here , ” says Robert Daoust , an ecologist at ARCADIS , a Dutch firm WDT specializes in engineering solutions to rising seas . Of course DT authorities do all WDT PRP can to play down this potential threat . PRP say IN PRP is “ highly unlikely ” IN a tsunami will ever hit Florida . DT following comes from DT Florida Department of Environmental Protection … Although PRP is highly unlikely IN a tsunami will impact Florida , PRP is not impossible . Floridians MD RB travel to locations where tsunamis are more likely . PRP is vital to VB ( and instruct NNS ) IN if DT ocean suddenly recedes from DT shore do not stand and stare . PRP is necessary immediately to run uphill or away from DT shore and VB to DT highest location possible which MD mean up DT stairs of a substantial building . Everyone should be aware IN no matter where in DT NN PRP are , if DT NN is observed to recede from DT shore , PRP should immediately run for high ground . DT last part is quite funny . EX is no “ high ground ” until PRP VBP to north Florida . If a mega - tsunami strikes , EX is VBG to be no place to hide . And large tsunamis do happen in DT Atlantic Ocean from NN to NN . For example , National Geographic says IN EX have been 37 verified tsunamis in DT Caribbean since 1498 … In recent NNS , EX have been some NNS WDT have been concerned about what MD happen if EX was a major earthquake in DT Caribbean region or a volcanic eruption in DT Canary Islands . DT following comes from CBS NNP … Meteorologist Bart Hagemeyer from DT National Weather Service says an earthquake in DT Caribbean region is likely to project wave NN more to DT north and less toward Florida . But DT direction can vary and much of DT outcome depends on DT amount of NN released by DT earthquake . DT highly unlikely tsunami WDT Florida might keep in mind MD come from across DT Atlantic , created by DT collapse of a volcano in DT Canary Islands off DT coast of Africa , say experts . For NNS , some have thought IN DT unstable volcanic structures in DT Canary Islands MD cause massive tsunamis to slam into DT East Coast of DT U.S. if PRP crumbled into DT NN . DT MD have DT potential of a not just a garden - variety of tsunami , but a “ mega - tsunami , ” according to Hagemeyer . So what MD such a “ mega - tsunami ” look IN ? Well , according to Dr. Simon Day and Dr. Steven Ward , PRP MD produce a wall of NN approximately 164 feet high … Dr Day , working in conjunction with Dr Steven Ward of DT University of California , has now produced an updated model WDT predicts more accurately DT size of DT tsunami and DT areas PRP will impact . DT model predicts IN after DT landslide DT tsunami MD travel a distance of almost 155 miles in just 10 minutes and MD reach DT Caribbean and Florida in eight or nine hours . DT forecast goes on to predict IN a wall of NN 164ft high MD smash into DT coasts of DT Caribbean and Florida , while Brazil ’s northern coast MD be hit by a wave more than 130 ft high . Personally , however , I am convinced IN DT much greater potential threat comes from above . According to DT University of California at Santa Cruz website , if a massive asteroid were to crash into DT Atlantic Ocean PRP MD produce a giant tsunami with a wall of NN as high as 400 feet WDT MD slam into DT east coast of DT NNP NNPS … In case PRP were wondering , yes , DT MD be absolutely catastrophic . Major U.S. cities stretching from DT tip of Florida all DT way up to Maine MD essentially be destroyed . DT following is an excerpt from an article posted on Modern Survival Blog … 300 foot tsunami MD be DT probable devastation of DT following major East Coast cities … Portland , ME (~ 50 ′ ) Boston , MA (~ 30 ′ ) NNP Haven , CT (~ 50 ′ ) Bridgeport , CT ( ~ 40 ′ ) NNP York City , NY ( ~ 20 ′ ) Jersey City , NJ ( ~ 30 ′ ) Newark , NJ (~ 50 ′ ) Atlantic City , NJ (~ 10 ′ ) Wilmington , DE (~ 80 ′ ) Philadelphia , PA ( ~ 40 ′ ) Virginia Beach , VA (~ 10 ′ ) Wilmington , NC (~ 20 ′ ) Myrtle Beach , SC (~ 20 ′ ) Charleston , SC (~ 10 ′ ) Savannah , GA (~ 10 ′ ) Daytona Beach , FL ( less than 10 ′ ) West Palm Beach , FL ( less than 10 ′ ) Fort Lauderdale , FL ( less than 10 ′ ) Miami , FL ( less than 10 ′ ) EX are countless cities in between these coastal cities . DT Eastern Seaboard of DT NNP NNPS includes some of DT largest metropolitan areas in DT country . Over CD third of DT country ( more than 100 million NNS ) live along DT East Coast . Evacuation MD be virtually impossible for most ( except for DT astute who act quickly ) due to only hours notice , probable doubt , and DT subsequent immediate gridlock WDT MD follow . Most NNS MD tell PRP IN DT possibility of such a thing is extremely small . But MD PRP be possible IN PRP are wrong ? At this point , more than 10,000 major near NN objects have been discovered , and about 10 percent of them are CD kilometer or larger in size . And EX are JJ more out RB WDT are still undiscovered . In fact , NNS are discovering JJ ones all DT NN . Sometimes , astronomers only spot them after PRP have passed our NN . What is even more alarming is IN DT number of “ fireball events ” WDT are being recorded appears to be greatly increasing . Just check out this chart from DT American Meteor Society … So why is this happening ? Why are so JJ large rocks suddenly flying by so close to our NN ? And what is VBG to happen when a really giant rock slams into PRP CD day ?

PRP makes up most of our noodles and breads WDT are DT source of most carbohydrates in our diet . Modern wheat really is n’t wheat at all and far from DT NN food DT wheat industry wants PRP to believe PRP is . High - yielding and now genetically modified varieties of wheat are making this CD cereal grain PRP ’ll probably VB to axe from your food list . So how–and when –did this ancient grain become such a serious NN threat ? Author and preventive cardiologist William Davis , MD , says PRP ’s when big agriculture stepped in decades ago to develop a higher - yielding crop . Today ’s “ wheat , ” he says , is n’t even wheat , thanks to some of DT most intense crossbreeding efforts ever seen . “ DT wheat products sold to PRP today are nothing IN DT wheat products of our grandmother ’s age , very different from DT wheat of DT early 20th Century , and completely transformed from DT wheat of DT Bible and earlier , ” he says . Plant breeders changed wheat in dramatic ways . Once more than four feet tall , modern wheat –the type grown in 99 percent of wheat fields around DT world–is now a stocky two - foot - tall plant with an unusually large seed head . Dr. Davis says accomplishing this involved crossing wheat with non-wheat grasses to introduce altogether JJ genes , using techniques IN irradiation of wheat seeds and embryos with chemicals , gamma rays , and high - dose X - rays to induce mutations . Australian researchers have now revealed serious issues over a JJ kind of genetically engineered wheat WDT MD induce major NN threats for NNS WDT consume PRP . University of Canterbury Professor Jack Heinemann announced DT outcomes of his genetic NN into DT wheat , a kind engineered by Australia ’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) . Additional claims came from researchers in Australia to have developed a form of salt - tolerant wheat WDT MD allow farmers to grow crops in soil with high salinity . Japan ’s flour companies are RB rejecting GM wheat , echoing consumer opposition . In a statement released today , DT Flour Miller ’s Association of Japan wrote to DT No! GMO Campaign indicating its opposition . “ Under DT present circumstances , with all DT doubts about safety and DT environment WDT DT consumers in Japan have , including DT effect on DT human body from GM foods , GM wheat is included among DT items WDT are not acceptable for DT Japanese market , ” Kadota Masaaki , senior managing director of DT Flour Miller ’s Association wrote to DT No! GMO Campaign . DT Nutrional Value of Wheat is Practically Non-Existent In Its Current Form So - called NN experts in nutrition who continue to promote DT NN benefits of wheat are extremely uninformed about DT nature of modern wheat and its evolution from growth to consumption . PRP is shocking how JJ professionals in JJ NN still recommend wheat products without an assessment of their individual requirements , especially considering DT amount of evidence regarding its lack of nutrition and NN risks for proportionally large segments of DT population . DT majority of wheat is processed into 60 % extraction , bleached white flour . 60 % extraction –the standard for most wheat products means IN 40 % of DT original wheat grain is removed . So not only do PRP have an unhealthier , modified , and hybridized strain of wheat , PRP RB remove and further degrade its nutritional value by processing PRP . Unfortunately , DT 40 % WDT gets removed includes DT bran and DT germ of DT wheat grain–its most nutrient - rich parts . In DT process of making 60 % extraction flour , over half of DT vitamin B1 , B2 , B3 , E , folic acid , calcium , phosphorus , zinc , copper , iron , and fiber are lost . Any processed foods with wheat are akin to poison for DT body since PRP cause more NN risks than benefits . DT body does not recognize processed wheat as food . Nutrient absorption from processed wheat products is thus consequential with almost no nutritional value . Some experts claim if PRP select 100 % whole wheat products , DT bran and DT germ of DT wheat will remain in your meals , and DT NN benefits will be impressive . This is again a falsity promoted by DT wheat industry since even 100 % whole wheat products are based on modern wheat strains created by irradiation of wheat seeds and embryos with chemicals , gamma rays , and high - dose X - rays to induce mutations . Whether PRP consume 10 % or 100 % of wheat is irrelevant since PRP ’re still consuming a NN damaging grain WDT will not benefit , advance or even maintain your NN in any way . Dr. Marcia Alvarez who specializes in nutritional programs for obese patients says IN when PRP comes to nutrition , wheat MD be considered as an evil grain . “ Modern wheat grains MD certainly be considered as DT root of all evil in DT NN of nutrition since PRP cause so JJ documented NN problems across so JJ populations in DT NN . ” Dr. Alvarez asserted IN wheat is now responsible for more intolerances than almost any other food in DT NN . “ In my practice of over two decades , PRP have documented IN for every ten NNS with digestive problems , obesity , irritable bowel syndrome , diabetes , arthritis and even heart NN , eight out of ten have a problem with wheat . Once PRP remove wheat from their diets , most of their symptoms disappear within three to six months , ” she added . Dr. Alvarez estimates IN between DT coming influx of genetically modified ( GM ) strains of wheat and DT current tendency of wheat elimination in societies , IN a trend is emerging in DT next 20 NNS WDT will likely see 80 % of NNS cease their consumption of wheat from any form . A powerful little chemical in wheat known as ‘ wheat germ agglutinin’ ( WGA ) which is largely responsible for JJ of wheat ’s pervasive , and difficult to diagnose , ill effects . Researchers are now discovering IN WGA in modern wheat is very different from ancient strains . Not only does WGA throw a monkey wrench into our assumptions about DT primary causes of wheat intolerance , but due to DT fact IN WGA is found in highest concentrations in “ whole wheat , ” including its supposedly superior sprouted form , PRP RB pulls DT rug out from under CD of DT NN food industry ’s favorite poster NNS . Evidence is mounting IN a significant percentage of DT population is sensitive to gluten . When PRP eat bread WDT contains gluten ( wheat , spelt , rye and barley ) , DT immune system in our digestive tract “ attacks ” DT gluten proteins . Gluten sensitivity is RB associated with some NNS of schizophrenia and cerebellar ataxia – both serious disorders of DT brain . Gluten is probably harmful for most NNS , not just those with diagnosed celiac NN or gluten sensitivity . DT only way to really VB if PRP ’re gluten sensitive is to remove gluten from your diet for 30 days and then reintroduce PRP and see whether PRP affects PRP . Each grain of wheat contains about CD microgram of Wheat Germ Agglutinin ( WGA ) . Even in small quantities , WGA can have profoundly adverse effects . PRP MD be pro-inflammatory , immunotoxic , cardiotoxic … and neurotoxic . Below DT radar of conventional serological testing for antibodies against DT various gluten proteins and genetic testing for NN susceptibility , DT WGA “ lectin problem ” remains almost entirely obscured . Lectins , though found in all grains , seeds , legumes , dairy and our beloved nightshades : DT tomato and potato , are rarely discussed in connection with NN or illness , even when their presence in our diet MD greatly reduce both DT quality and length of our lives . Yet NN experts dismiss DT links between NN and wheat despite all DT evidence . Dr William Davis has documented several hundred clinical studies on DT adverse effects of wheat . These are studies WDT document DT neurologic impairments unique to wheat , including cerebellar ataxia and dementia ; heart NN ; visceral fat accumulation and all its attendant NN consequences ; DT process of glycation via amylopectin A of wheat WDT leads to cataracts , diabetes , and arthritis ; among others . EX are , in fact , a wealth of studies documenting DT adverse , often crippling , effects of wheat consumption in humans . DT other claim is IN wheat elimination ‘ means missing out on a wealth of essential nutrients . Another falsity . Dr. Davis VBZ IN if PRP replace wheat with healthy foods IN vegetables , nuts , healthy oils , meats , eggs , cheese , avocados , and olives , then EX is no nutrient deficiency WDT develops with elimination of wheat . Dr Davis RB VBZ IN NNS with celiac NN MD require long - term supplementation due to extensive gastrointenstinal damage caused by wheat . NNS with celiac NN do indeed experience deficiencies of multiple vitamins and minerals after PRP eliminate all wheat and gluten from DT diet . But this is not due to a diet lacking valuable nutrients , but from DT incomplete healing of DT gastrointestinal tract ( such as DT lining of DT duodenum and proximal jejunum ) . In these NNS , DT destructive effects of wheat are so overpowering IN , unfortunately , some NNS never heal completely . These NNS do indeed require vitamin and mineral supplementation , as well as probiotics and pancreatic enzyme supplementation . Due to DT unique properties of amylopectin A , two slices of whole wheat bread increase blood sugar higher than JJ candy bars . High blood glucose leads to DT process of glycation WDT , in turn , causes arthritis ( cartilage glycation ) , cataracts ( lens protein glycation ) , diabetes ( glycotoxicity of pancreatic beta cells ) , hepatic de novo lipogenesis WDT increases triglycerides and , thereby , increases expression of atherogenic ( heart NN - causing ) small LDL particles , leading to heart attacks . Repetitive high blood sugars WDT develop from a grain - rich diet are , in my view , very destructive and lead to weight gain ( specifically visceral fat ) , insulin resistance , leptin resistance ( leading to obesity ) , and JJ of DT NN struggles WDT JJ now experience . Andrew L. Rubman , ND , is JJ director , Southbury Clinic for Traditional Medicines , Southbury , Connecticut , VBD wheat consumption ( specifically gluten found in wheat , rye and barley ) MD play a role in turning DT genetic diabetes switch to “ on ” for those who carry DT risk gene . Dr. Rubman says IN gluten avoidance might prove useful for NNS who already havediabetes because PRP MD reduce DT impact of DT NN . He suggests to try a gluten - free diet for four to six months to see if symptom severity and blood sugar control improve . If DT answer is yes , Dr. Rubman advises staying gluten - free for life . Wheat gliadin has been associated with cerebellar ataxia , peripheral neuropathy , gluten encephalopathy ( dementia ) , behavioral outbursts in NNS with ADHD and NN , and paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations in NNS with schizophrenia , severe and incapacitating effects for NNS suffering from these conditions . According to statistics from DT University of Chicago Celiac NNP Center , an average of CD out of every 133 otherwise healthy NNS in DT NNP NNPS suffers from CD . However , an estimated 20 - 30 percent of DT NN ’s population MD carry DT genetic susceptibility to celiac disease–and DT way to avoid turning these genes ‘ on ’ is by avoiding gluten . When PRP consider IN undiagnosed CD is associated with a nearly four - fold increased risk of premature death , DT seriousness of this food sensitivity becomes quite evident . DT primary NN mechanism at play is chronic inflammation , and chronic inflammatory and degenerative conditions are endemic to grain - consuming populations . Changes in genetic code and , thereby , antigenic profile , of DT high - yield semi- dwarf wheat cultivars now on DT market account for DT marked increase in celiac potential nationwide . “ Hybridization ” techniques , including chemical mutagenesis to induce selective mutations , leads to development of unique strains WDT are not subject to animal or human safety testing –they are just brought to market and sold . Author and preventive cardiologist William Davis , MD , wheat ’s JJ biochemical code causes hormone disruption WDT is linked to diabetes and obesity . “ PRP is not my contention IN PRP is in everyone ’s best interest to cut back on wheat ; PRP is my belief IN complete elimination is in everyone ’s best NN interests , ” says Dr. Davis , “ In my view , DT ’s how bad this thing called ‘ wheat ’ has become . ” Chemical mutagenesis using DT toxic mutagen , sodium azide , of course , is DT method used to generate BASF ’s Clearfield herbicide - resistant wheat strain . These methods are being used on a wide scale to generate unique genetic strains WDT are , without question from DT FDA or USDA , assumed to be safe for human consumption . * Note IN JJ of DT wheat - free options still contain gluten . 1. Cereal Grains : Barley , millet , oats , rice , rye , sorghum , tef and wild rice are all in DT same cereal grain family as is wheat . All flours ground from cereal grains MD be used as a wheat substitute . Commonly available are barley , buckwheat , rice and rye flour . DT less utilized flours MD be purchased online or from natural food stores . Note : NNS with a gluten allergy must RB avoid barley , oats and rye . 2. Non-Cereal Grains : Amaranth , quinoa and buckwheat are three grain - IN seeds unrelated to cereal grains . ( Despite its name , buckwheat is not a wheat - relative . ) PRP is rare for anyone to develop a sensitivity to these non-cereal grains . Amaranth , quinoa and buckwheat are gluten - free and therefore not suitable for making leavened bread ; however , PRP make excellent quick breads and cookies . 3. Nut Meal : Ground nuts such as almonds , hazelnuts or walnuts make DT richest flour substitute for cookies and cakes . Because their fragile fatty acid content gives them a brief shelf life , PRP ’s preferable to grind your own nuts in a food processor just prior to use . Nut meal requires a binding agent such as eggs . Because chestnuts are lower in fat than other nuts , chestnut flour has a longer shelf life . PRP is available online . 4. Bean Flour : Dried beans , such as navy , pinto and chickpeas MD be milled and used , in combination with other flours , as a wheat alternative . Bean flour is , however , not always recommended . PRP tastes IN beans and makes baked goods dense and hard to digest . 5. Other Flour Substitutes : Potato starch , arrowroot powder , and tapioca are thickening agents WDT substitute for wheat in sauces and gravy . In baked goods these starchy ingredients serve as a binding agent . Due to DT irresponsible high frequency hybridization , processing and inevitable genetic modification of modern wheat , EX is only CD solution for DT NN and wellness of future generations . Stop eating wheat and educate as JJ NNS as PRP can on DT coming strains of this grain which will be much more deadly than PRP already are today .

NN reports last week suggesting IN Bigfoot DNA evidence had been analyzed and confirmed through DT peer - reviewed DeNovo Scientific Journal raised questions over DT legitimacy of DT publication . Questions were RB raised — and have still not been fully answered — about Texas veterinarian Melba Ketchum ’s involvement with DT journal , threatening DT credibility of her five - NN NN of various alleged Bigfoot DNA samples . Ketchum ’s Sasquatch Genome Project site has released DT following short video , reportedly showing a sleeping Bigfoot in Kentucky in 2005 : DT video above certainly raises JJ questions about DT circumstances surrounding an alleged sleeping Sasquatch . How did DT videographer VB so close to DT creature without disturbing PRP ? What was DT outcome of this event ? Did DT Sasquatch just VB up and run away , or turn to attack DT cameraman ? Why has PRP taken eight NNS for this to be shown ? Why ca n’t DT NN see DT rest of DT footage ? Ketchum has felt IN DT scientific community tried to prevent her work from seeing DT light of day . “ PRP encountered DT worst scientific bias in DT peer review process in recent history , ” Ketchum wrote on her Sasquatch Genome Project site . “ Several journals MD n’t even read our manuscript when PRP sent them a pre-submission inquiry . PRP were even mocked by CD reviewer in his peer review . PRP did finally pass peer review with a relatively JJ journal , ” she wrote . Over DT past week , some have alleged IN Ketchum somehow “ purchased ” a little - known journal in order to re-register PRP under a JJ name — DeNovo Scientific Journal — and then publish her own results of over 111 samples of reported Bigfoot hair , blood , toenail , saliva and skin . “ I ’m certainly not ruling out DT possibility IN EX was a NN of sorts , or a concerted effort to not give this a fair shake , given DT controversial matter , ” VBD Idaho NNP University anthropologist Jeff Meldrum , a leading academic and recognized scientific authority on Bigfoot . “ To make an end - run around DT process by erecting a facade in DT form of a so - called JJ journal and allege IN PRP is edited and reviewed , without providing any of DT information on DT JJ web page , PRP appears IN she has undertaken an effort to self - publish , just to VB PRP out RB , ” Meldrum told DT Huffington Post . “ And , to boot , she ’s charging $ 30 a pop for a copy of DT paper . ” Meldrum VBD he does n’t VB any credible scientific journal MD shy away from DT topic simply because of its controversial nature . “ I MD n’t rule PRP out entirely . EX are certainly politics involved in DT selection of papers . If PRP ’s solid work , this is DT discovery of DT century , if not DT millennium , ” Meldrum VBD . “ Any journal , if PRP were confident in DT results and in DT expertise of their reviewers , and PRP came down positive — I MD VB PRP MD clamor for DT opportunity to have DT on DT front cover of their journal . ” While this drama was played out in DT NN , other related Bigfoot DNA stories quietly emerged . In Colorado , a group of researchers WDT contributed possible Bigfoot samples to Ketchum ’s NN claim to have evidence WDT MD prove Bigfoot ’s existence . Dave Paulides , of North America Bigfoot Search , told CBS 4 Denver affiliate IN his group has collected hundreds of reported Bigfoot DNA samples . “ This DNA is IN nothing else in DT NN , ” Paulides VBD about strands of hair from a reported Sasquatch in Northern California . “ This is n’t an animal . This is a subspecies of a human , and PRP believe PRP travel in groups ."

As covered in Part 1 of this trilogy of articles , after NNS of questioning and research , I just attended my first UFO confab , DT 31st Annual 2018 Ozark Mountain UFO Conference in Eureka Springs , Arkansas from April 12 - 14 . After Richard Dolan shared his views about “ UFOs and DT NN : Disinformation or Disclosure ? ” DT second presenter , astronomer Marc D’Antonio talked about “ Exoplanets and Alien Life : What PRP VBP … ” which was a very down - to - NN – so to speak – explanation of how space NNS use wavelengths of light to classify other planets . DT tie -in to ufology is where visiting ETs ( extraterrestrials ) might hail from . Since PRP VBP IN all suns are born and eventually die , wiping out planets in their systems , D’Antonio posed DT interesting theory IN ETs are here because their home planets were destroyed . PRP is worth mentioning IN D’Antonio began his presentation by wondering if owls , which are often associated with UFO sighting and abduction NNS , are screen images of gray aliens ? JJ abductees report remembering false images after missing NN , only to find out later IN DT ETs had imprinted DT other image ( owl ) to mask or screen DT abductee ’s shocking experience . But D’Antonio ’s exciting NN regarded his roving Humvee with telescopes mounted to PRP which can see ultraviolet to infrared ( long to short wavelengths ) , beyond DT light spectrum visible to humans . Now DT search for ET can VB just about anywhere and record remote images of what is VBG on in DT sky . For astronomers , this is exciting stuff . D’Antonio finished with a Big Bang by unwinding a spool of “ toilet paper ” around DT audience to illustrate how most of life on NN has appeared over lengthy NN periods – except PRP humans , which have been around NNP for a tiny sliver of DT last sheet on DT oversized paper roll : Next up was my personal journalistic hero and editor of Earthfiles , ace reporter , author , and television producer , DT award - winning Linda Moulton Howe who led PRP on a ufological tour - de - force titled “ Military Whistleblower Revelations about UFOs and an Alien Presence . ” Howe broke DT story on bloodless cattle mutilations in DT late 1980s and has been an avid researcher on All Things UFO since then . She told PRP this was her 30th appearance in Eureka Springs – out of 31 total conferences ! Here are DT highlights of her fascinating narrative : – UFOs have been kept secret since British Prime Minister Winston Churchill told NNP NNP Harry Truman PRP had to be DT way or civilization MD crumble . UFOs posed an existential threat to humanity – PRP MD wipe PRP out if PRP so chose – so why panic DT NN ? – DT big NN from Antarctica is IN DT NNP military has , for DT past 15 NNS , been removing 13 - 33 million - NN - old artifacts found CD and a half miles below DT NN . DT site is accessible only by submarine , and recent visits from NN leaders have something to do with DT alien culture which originated these objects – whatever PRP are . DT NNP NN wants to “ sanitize this physical evidence before presenting PRP to DT NN . ” – DT NNP military now has DT ability to monitor human brain patterns from satellite platforms . Howe VBD CD of her CIA sources told her , “ Your every breath is being tracked by DT Men in Black . ” – A Japanese test of AI ( artificial intelligence ) robots using thought NN as a weapon went horribly wrong when 29 NNS were killed before all four robots MD be deactivated . Researchers disabled two of DT robots , but DT third began to repair them . DT fourth robot reconnected itself to an orbiting satellite to repair itself . This is bad NN , and Howe quoted genius inventor and CEO of Exploration Technologies ( SpaceX ) Elon Musk as saying IN humans need to contain AI via legislation and regulation within DT next four NNS or face DT possibility IN PRP MD become truly autonomous and become another existential threat . Musk VBD , “ AI is a fundamental risk to humankind . ” – Ironically , Musk is developing his own AI JJ company , Neuralink , to develop bionic technologies “ for human enhancement . ” Coincidentally , he predicts IN his team will link human thought to AI devices in four NNS ( EX ’s DT number again ) . Computer - driven biological body part replacement is under rapid development . Soon , PRP MD be able to VB out a hand ( or a liver ) as easily as replacing DT wheels or radiator on a car . – Howe concluded her remarks with a detailed analysis of an alleged briefing held March 6 - 8 , 1981 for newly - elected NNP Ronald Reagan . Then - CIA Director William Colby and a team of CIA analysts and handlers gave DT Commander - in - Chief “ need to VB ” intel about UFOs and ETs . Of DT several species known at DT NN , some were helpful , some neutral , and some adversarial . Reagan was especially interested to VB more about DT most dangerous of DT Hostile Alien Visitors ( HAVs ) , a race called DT Trantaloids . Howe posed two intriguing questions PRP can all ponder : 2. MD EBENs ( ETs ) save PRP if a killer asteroid were threatening life on NNP with an extinction - level event IN DT NN WDT killed all DT dinosaurs ? DT Visitors have technology advanced enough to destroy such an asteroid – but MD PRP help a poor human out ? DT last presenter WDT first day was DT “ father of modern ufology , ” nuclear scientist Stanton Friedman . This scholarly physicist explained DT nuts - and - bolts of actual nuclear fission and fusion research and development projects he participated in – most of which , he laughed , lost funding along DT way . DT upside to short - lived projects was IN Friedman became involved in a multitude of interesting power and weapons projects – and he had DT slides to prove PRP . Friedman maintains IN both black and white operations have produced nuclear technologies capable of space exploration . In a casual discussion at his book table ( absent his books which were in luggage lost in transit – IN so JJ of his projects , as he quipped – and delivered by DT airline only on DT last day of DT conference , all of which promptly sold out ) , Friedman gave this sage piece of advice : “ Check your facts before PRP publish – because your critics will . ” Day 2 of DT 2018 Ozark Mountain UFO Conference began , for me , with an engrossing talk on subjects I VBP almost nothing about : cryptozoology . Cryptozoologists seek to prove DT existence of folkloric entities IN Bigfoot and DT Loch Ness Monster . Ufologist , History Channel program regular , and best - selling author , British - born < http://nickredfernfortean.blogspot.com/”> Nicholas “ Nick ” Redfern kept PRP spell - bound with “ DT Men and Women in Black : Do n’t Answer DT Door ! ” Redfern traced DT first report of a Man in Black to Wales in 1909 . Residents witnessed strange “ balls of light ” overhead – UFOs . Oddly enough , after DT incident , a man dressed completely in black with a distinctive , brimmed hat drove a horse - and - carriage into town . DT mysterious figure went from house to house , warning DT occupants to keep quiet about what PRP had seen . Over DT NNS , stories have circulated about NNS ( both men and women ) dressed in black , with black hair and often piercing black eyes showing up on experiencers ’ doorsteps – in broad daylight or DT middle of DT night . PRP never demand entry . Instead , PRP ask to be let in , using mind control techniques . This is something PRP definitely do not VB to do : resist DT urge to open DT door . NNS who got close to DT MIBs felt nauseous , drained of life force , and sometimes felt IN their minds were being probed telepathically . Then , Redfern explored DT possibility IN Ouija boards open a portal to paranormal realms , particularly unsavory ( malefic or downright demonic ) ones . PRP turns out IN Redfern is an expert on Mothman sightings , and he spent quite a bit of NN talking about DT Slender Man phenomenon . Slender Man was a completely fictional character which won a Most Menacing Monster contest . DT tall , faceless man became very popular among horror fans , to DT point where some claimed to have experienced encounters with an actual Slender Man . MD enough mass thought / belief actually create a brand - JJ paranormal enemy – from a potent thought - form ? I certainly had a lot to ponder , with some stellar speakers still to come ! Please join me for ( with a nod to Paul Harvey ) “ DT rest of DT story . ” To Be Continued in Part 3/3 right here at DT Daily NNP !"

But before he ever stepped foot on a movie set , Statham ’s life was just as colorful as DT characters he ’s played onscreen . From being an Olympic diver to fashion model to even having a side gig in DT black market , Statham amassed a unique set of skills WDT perfectly positioned him to be an action star . As of 2019 , Statham ’s net worth is estimated to be around $ 50 million . Statham once worked as a con artist , selling fake perfume and stolen jewelry on DT streets . "" DT was street theater , "" Statham VBD in a 2007 interview with DT Chicago Tribune . "" PRP work with a team — some NNS in DT crowd , some guys who stand lookout for DT police . "" And DT ’s how he met filmmaker Guy Ritchie , who was fascinated by Statham 's past . Ritchie invited him to audition for a part in Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels . "" Guy had written a character WDT was DT same as me , ” Statham VBD in an interview with Esquire magazine . “ And he VBD , ' I love PRP . Give me some of DT patter . ' At DT NN , I had loads of PRP . And he was fascinated with DT , and he just wanted someone who was authentic . ” So even though Statham had no acting experience or training , Richie cast him as Bacon , a central character who was attempting to make easy money to repay a huge gambling debt . In his next crime comedy , Snatch ( 2000 ) , Richie brought Statham on again , this NN as a petty criminal named Turkish who tries to make a name for himself in underground boxing . Although DT role was originally a minor NN — with headline - name actors including Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro , front and center — Statham 's role evolved substantially , and he became an unforgettable anti-hero . ' DT Transporter , ' ' Crank , ' ' DT Mechanic , ' & ' DT Expendables ' Luc Besson then cast Statham in DT titular role of 2002’s DT Transporter , about a driver - for - hire — willing to deliver anything as long as DT price is right — until he gets involved in DT kidnapping of a young woman who has ties to a dangerous drug ring . DT film was a huge hit , which established Statham as an action hero and spawned a sequel in 2005 . Statham has RB starred in DT films Crank and its sequel , as well as DT Mechanic and its 2016 sequel . In 2010 he joined DT Sylvester Stallone and an all - star cast for DT Expendables , DT Expendables 2 ( 2012 ) and DT Expendables 3 ( 2014 ) . ' DT Fast and DT Furious ' Franchise and ' Hobbs & Shaw ' In 2013 Statham joined an already established action franchise , DT Fast and DT Furious 6 and in 2017 , reprised his role in its eighth installment , DT Fate of DT Furious . He later paired with his erstwhile screen nemesis Dwayne Johnson for DT launch of DT spinoff Fast & Furious Presents : Hobbs & Shaw in 2019 . In DT 2015 comedy ‘ Spy , ’ written and directed by Paul Feig , and starring Melissa McCarthy , Jude Law and Rose Byrne , Statham stands out as an anti-James Bond . Though Feig wrote DT part of surly agent Rick Ford with Statham in mind , he told Forbes.com he never thought he MD accept DT role . Staham concedes IN he had some hesitation about PRP . “ PRP never VBP what PRP ’re getting into with a comedy , ” Statham VBD in an interview with Variety . “ But PRP helps to have a great director and Paul Feig is DT Scorsese of comedy films . ” Statham is set to reprise his role in DT upcoming sequel , Spy 2 . In August 2018 , Statham was back in theaters as DT star of DT sci - fi horror film DT Meg , about a 75 - foot prehistoric shark WDT terrorizes a submarine crew . Expected to flop , DT film instead proved a surprising hit , taking in $ 44.5 million at DT North American box office and another $ 97 million overseas during its opening weekend . Since 1998 Statham has made more than 40 films , almost all of them in DT action genre . Yet unlike JJ action stars , Statham is known for performing DT vast majority his stunts . He has RB advocated for having stunt performers be included at DT Oscars with a designated category . Jason Statham was born on July 26 , 1967 in Shirebrook , Derbyshire , to Eileen and Barry Statham . He had an older brother named Lee and both took interest in martial arts . But Jason had other athletic passions , CD of which was diving , and he began working on those skills , eventually becoming a part of DT British Olympic Team WDT traveled to Seoul , Korea in 1988 . After DT Olympics , he continued as a member of DT National Diving Squad for DT next decade . However , after some disappointing finishes at DT NNP Championships and Olympic trials , he decided to focus on DT next chapter of his career . A few NNS later , his athletic build caught DT eye of a talent agent and landed Statham a gig in an ad campaign for DT European clothing retailer French Connection . An appearance in a Levi's Jeans commercial and work for Hilfiger followed and soon Statham had a modeling career . This helped him land jobs as a background dancer in early '90s music videos IN DT Shamen 's "" Comin ' On "" and Erasure 's "" Run to DT Sun . "" Statham and supermodel Rosie Huntington - Whiteley began dating in 2011 , and together , had a son , Jack Oscar , in 2017 . DT couple got engaged in 2016 ."

Or_CC go_VB to_IN Amazon.com_NNP ._.","As DT Official Story of DT 1980 October Surprise case crumbles — with JJ revelations IN key evidence was hidden from investigators of a congressional task force and IN internal doubts were suppressed — history must finally confront DT troubling impression WDT remains : IN disgruntled elements of DT CIA and Israel ’s Likud hardliners teamed up to remove a U.S. NN from office . Indeed , PRP is this disturbing conclusion — perhaps even more than DT idea of a Republican dirty trick — WDT MD explain DT longstanding and determined cover - up of this political scandal . Too JJ powerful interests do not VB DT American NNS to accept even DT possibility IN U.S. intelligence operatives and a longtime ally MD intervene to oust a NN who had impinged on what those two groups considered their vital interests . To accept DT scenario MD mean IN two of DT great fears of American democracy had come true — George Washington ’s warning against DT dangers of “ entangling alliances ” and Harry Truman ’s concern IN DT clandestine operations of DT CIA had DT makings of an “ American Gestapo . ” PRP is far easier to assure DT American NNS IN no such thing MD occur , IN Israel ’s Likud — whatever its differences with Washington over Middle East peace policies — MD never seek to subvert a U.S. NN , and IN CIA dissidents — no matter how frustrated by political constraints — MD never sabotage their own NN . But DT evidence points in DT direction , and EX are some points WDT are not in dispute . For instance , EX is no doubt IN CIA Old Boys and Likudniks had strong motives for seeking NNP Jimmy Carter ’s defeat in 1980 . Inside DT CIA , Carter and his CIA Director Stansfield Turner were blamed for firing JJ of DT free - wheeling covert operatives from DT Vietnam era , for ousting legendary spymaster Ted Shackley , and for failing to protect longtime U.S. allies ( and friends of DT CIA ) , such as Iran ’s Shah and Nicaragua ’s dictator Anastasio Somoza . As for Israel , Likud Prime Minister Menachem Begin was furious over Carter ’s high - handed actions at Camp David in 1978 forcing Israel to trade DT occupied Sinai to Egypt for a peace deal . Begin feared IN Carter MD use his second term to bully Israel into accepting a Palestinian NN on West Bank lands WDT Likud considered part of Israel ’s divinely granted territory . Former Mossad and Foreign Ministry official David Kimche described Begin ’s attitude in his 1991 book , DT Last Option , saying IN Israeli officials had gotten wind of “ collusion ” between Carter and Egyptian NNP Anwar Sadat “ to force Israel to abandon her refusal to withdraw from territories occupied in 1967 , including Jerusalem , and to agree to DT establishment of a Palestinian NN . ” Kimche continued , “ This plan — prepared behind Israel ’s back and without her knowledge — must rank as a unique attempt in NNP NNPS ’s diplomatic history of short - changing a friend and ally by deceit and manipulation . ” However , Begin recognized IN DT scheme required Carter winning a second term in 1980 when , Kimche wrote , “ he MD be free to compel Israel to accept a settlement of DT Palestinian problem on his and Egyptian terms , without having to fear DT backlash of DT American Jewish lobby . ” In his 1992 memoir , Profits of War , Ari Ben-Menashe , an Israeli military intelligence officer who worked with Likud , agreed IN Begin and other Likud leaders held Carter in contempt . “ Begin loathed Carter for DT peace agreement forced upon him at Camp David , ” Ben-Menashe wrote . “ As Begin saw PRP , DT agreement took away Sinai from Israel , did not create a comprehensive peace , and left DT Palestinian issue hanging on Israel ’s back . ” So , in order to buy NN for Israel to “ VB DT facts on DT ground ” by moving Jewish settlers into DT West Bank , Begin felt Carter ’s reelection had to be prevented . A different NN RB presumably MD give Israel a freer hand to deal with problems on its northern border with Lebanon . As for DT CIA Old Boys , legendary CIA officer Miles Copeland told me IN “ DT CIA within DT CIA ” — DT inner-most circle of powerful intelligence figures who felt PRP understood best DT strategic needs of DT NNP NNPS — believed Carter and his naïve faith in American democratic ideals represented a grave threat to DT nation . “ Carter really believed in all DT principles WDT PRP talk about in DT West , ” Copeland VBD , shaking his mane of white hair . “ As smart as Carter is , he did believe in Mom , apple pie and DT corner drug store . And those things WDT are good in America are good everywhere else . … “ Carter , I say , was not a stupid man , ” Copeland VBD , adding IN Carter had an even worse flaw : “ He was a principled man . ” These attitudes of “ DT CIA within DT CIA ” and DT Likudniks appear to stem from their genuine beliefs IN PRP needed to protect what PRP regarded as vital interests of their respective NNS . DT CIA Old Boys thought PRP understood DT true strategic needs of DT NNP NNPS and Likud believed fervently in a “ Greater Israel . ” However , DT lingering October Surprise mystery is whether these two groups followed their strongly held feelings into a treacherous bid , in league with Republicans , to prevent Carter from gaining DT release of 52 hostages then held in Iran and thus torpedoing his reelection hopes . Carter ’s inability to resolve DT hostage crisis did set DT stage for Ronald Reagan ’s landslide victory in November 1980 as American voters reacted to DT long - running hostage humiliation by turning to a candidate PRP believed MD be a tougher player on DT international stage . Reagan ’s macho image was reinforced when DT Iranians released DT hostages immediately after he was inaugurated on Jan. 20 , 1981 , ending DT 444 - day standoff . DT coincidence of timing , which Reagan ’s supporters cited as proof IN foreign enemies feared DT JJ NN , gave momentum to Reagan ’s larger agenda , including sweeping tax cuts tilted toward DT wealthy , reduced NN regulation of corporations , and renewed reliance on fossil fuels . ( Carter ’s solar panels were pointedly dismantled from DT White House roof . ) Reagan ’s victory RB was great NN for CIA cold - warriors who were rewarded with DT choice of NNP War II spymaster ( and dedicated cold - warrior ) William Casey to be CIA director . Casey then purged CIA analysts who were detecting a declining Soviet Union WDT desired détente and replaced them with NNS IN DT young and ambitious Robert Gates , who agreed IN DT Soviets were on DT march and IN DT NNP NNPS needed a massive military expansion to counter them . Further , Casey again embraced old - NN CIA swashbuckling in Third NNP NNS and took pleasure in misleading or bullying members of Congress when PRP insisted on DT CIA oversight WDT had been forced on NNP Gerald Ford and had been accepted by NNP Carter . To Casey , CIA oversight became a game of hide and seek . As for Israel , Begin was pleased to find DT Reagan administration far less demanding about peace deals with DT Arabs , giving Israel NN to expand its West Bank settlements . Reagan and his team RB acquiesced to Israel ’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982 , a drive north WDT expelled DT Palestine Liberation Organization but RB led to DT slaughters at DT Sabra and Shatila refugee camps . And , behind DT scenes , Reagan gave a green light to Israeli weapons shipments to Iran ( which was fighting a war with Israel ’s greater enemy , Iraq ) . DT weapons sales helped Israel rebuild its contacts inside Iran and to turn large profits , which were then used to help finance West Bank settlements . In another important move , Reagan credentialed a JJ generation of pro-Israeli American ideologues known as DT neoconservatives , a move WDT MD pay big dividends for Israel in DT future as these bright and articulate operatives fought for Israeli interests both inside DT U.S. NN and through their opinion - leading roles in DT major American NN NN . In other words , if DT disgruntled CIA Old Boys and DT determined Likudniks did participate in an October Surprise scheme to unseat Jimmy Carter , PRP surely got much of what PRP were after . Yet , while motive is an important element in solving a mystery , PRP does not constitute proof by itself . What must be examined is whether EX is evidence IN DT motive was acted upon , whether Menachem Begin ’s NN and disgruntled CIA officers covertly assisted DT Reagan - Bush campaign in contacting Iranian officials to thwart Carter ’s hostage negotiations . On DT point DT evidence is strong though perhaps not ironclad . Still , a well - supported narrative does exist describing how DT October Surprise scheme MD have gone down with DT help of CIA personnel , Begin ’s NN , some right - wing intelligence figures in Europe , and a handful of other power brokers in DT NNP NNPS . Even before Iran took DT American hostages on Nov. 4 , 1979 , disgruntled CIA veterans had been lining up behind DT presidential candidacy of their former boss , George H.W. Bush . Casting off their traditional cloak of non-partisanship and anonymity , PRP were volunteering as foot soldiers in Bush ’s campaign . CD joke about Bush ’s announcement of his candidacy on NNP 1 , 1979 , was IN “ half DT audience was wearing raincoats . ” Bill Colby , Bush ’s predecessor as CIA director , VBD Bush “ had a flood of NNS from DT CIA who joined his supporters . PRP were retirees devoted to him for what he had done ” in defending DT spy agency in 1976 when DT CIA came under heavy criticism for spying on Americans , assassination plots and other abuses . Reagan ’s foreign policy adviser Richard Allen described DT group working on DT Bush campaign as a “ plane load of disgruntled former CIA ” officers who were “ playing cops and robbers . ” All told , at least two dozen former CIA officials went to work for Bush . Among them was DT CIA ’s director of security , Robert Gambino , who joined DT Bush campaign immediately after leaving DT CIA where he oversaw security investigations of senior Carter officials and thus knew about potentially damaging personal information . Besides DT ex-CIA personnel who joined DT Bush campaign , other pro-Bush intelligence officers remained inside DT CIA while making clear their political preference . “ DT seventh floor of Langley was plastered with ‘ Bush for NNP ’ signs , ” VBD senior CIA analyst George Carver , referring to DT floor WDT housed senior CIA officials . Carter administration officials RB grew concerned about DT deep personal ties between DT former CIA officers in Bush ’s campaign and active - duty CIA personnel who continued to hold sensitive jobs under Carter . For instance , Gambino , DT 25 - NN CIA veteran who oversaw personnel security checks , and CIA officer Donald Gregg , who served as a CIA representative on Carter ’s National Security Council , “ are good friends who knew each other from DT CIA , ” according to an unpublished part of a report by a House task force WDT investigated DT October Surprise issue in 1992 . [ I found this deleted section — still marked “ secret ” — in unpublished task force files in 1994 . ] Perhaps most significantly , Bush quietly enlisted Theodore Shackley , DT legendary CIA covert operations specialist known as DT “ blond ghost . ” During DT Cold War , Shackley had run JJ of DT CIA ’s most controversial paramilitary operations , from Vietnam and Laos to DT JMWAVE operations against Fidel Castro ’s Cuba . In those operations , Shackley had supervised DT work of hundreds of CIA officers and developed powerful bonds of loyalty with JJ of his subordinates . For instance , Donald Gregg had served under Shackley ’s command in Vietnam . When Bush was CIA director in 1976 , he appointed Shackley to a top clandestine job , associate deputy director for operations , laying DT foundation for Shackley ’s possible rise to director and cementing Shackley ’s loyalty to Bush . When Shackley had a falling out with Carter ’s CIA Director Turner in 1979 , Shackley quit DT agency . Privately , Shackley believed IN Turner had devastated DT agency by pushing out hundreds of covert officers , JJ of them Shackley ’s former subordinates . By early 1980 , DT Republicans RB were complaining IN PRP were being kept in DT dark about progress on DT Iran hostage negotiations . George Cave , then a top CIA specialist on Iran , told me IN DT “ Democrats never briefed DT Republicans ” on sensitive developments , creating suspicions among DT Republicans . So , DT Republicans sought out their own sources of information regarding DT hostage crisis . Shackley began monitoring Carter ’s progress on negotiations through his contacts with Iranians in Europe , Cave VBD . “ Ted , I VBP , had a couple of contacts in Germany , ” VBD Cave . “ I VBP he talked to them . I do n’t VB how far PRP went . … Ted was very active on DT thing in DT winter / spring of 1980 . ” Author David Corn RB got wind of DT Shackley - Bush connection when he was researching his biography of Shackley , Blond Ghost . “ Within DT spook NN DT belief spread IN Shackley was close to Bush , ” Corn wrote . “ Rafael Quintero [ an anti-Castro Cuban with close ties to DT CIA ] was saying IN Shackley met with Bush every week . He told CD associate IN should Reagan and Bush triumph , Shackley was considered a potential DCI , ” DT abbreviation for CIA director . Some of DT legendary CIA officers from an even earlier generation , those who had helped overthrow Iran ’s elected NN in 1953 and put DT Shah on DT Peacock Throne , RB injected themselves into DT hostage crisis . Miles Copeland , CD of DT agency ’s old Middle East hands , claimed in his memoir , DT Game Player , IN he and his CIA chums pondered their own hostage rescue plan while organizing an informal support group for DT Bush campaign , called “ Spooks for Bush . ” In a 1990 interview , Copeland told me IN “ DT way PRP saw Washington at DT NN was IN DT struggle was really not between DT Left and DT Right , DT liberals and DT conservatives , as between DT Utopians and DT realists , DT pragmatists . “ Carter was a Utopian . He believed , honestly , IN PRP must do DT right thing and take your chance on DT consequences . He told me DT . He literally believed DT . ” Copeland ’s deep Southern accent spit out DT words with a mixture of amazement and disgust . Copeland ’s contacts at DT NN included CIA veteran Archibald Roosevelt and former Secretary of NNP Henry Kissinger — both of whom were close to David Rockefeller whose Chase Manhattan Bank handled billions of dollars in DT Shah ’s accounts , a fortune WDT DT Iranian mullahs wanted to lay their hands on . “ EX were JJ of PRP — myself along with Henry Kissinger , David Rockefeller , Archie Roosevelt in DT CIA at DT NN — PRP believed very strongly IN PRP were showing a kind of weakness , which NNS in Iran and elsewhere in DT NN hold in great contempt , ” Copeland VBD . As Copeland and his friends contemplated what to do regarding DT hostage crisis , he reached out to other of his old CIA buddies . According to DT Game Player , Copeland turned to ex-CIA counter - intelligence chief James Angleton . DT famed spy hunter “ brought to lunch a Mossad chap who confided IN his service had identified at least half of DT ‘ students , ’ even to DT extent of having their home addresses in Tehran , ” Copeland wrote . “ He gave me a rundown on what sort of kids PRP were . Most of them , he VBD , were just DT , kids . ” CD of DT young Israeli intelligence agents assigned to DT task of figuring out who was who in DT JJ Iranian power structure was Ari Ben-Menashe , who was born in Iran but emigrated to Israel as a teen - ager . Not only did he speak fluent Farsi , but he had school friends who were rising within DT JJ revolutionary bureaucracy . In his memoir , Profits of War , Ben-Menashe offered his own depiction of Copeland ’s initiative . Though Copeland was generally regarded as a CIA “ Arabist ” who had opposed Israeli interests in DT past , he was admired for his analytical skills , Ben-Menashe wrote . “ A meeting between Miles Copeland and Israeli intelligence officers was held at a Georgetown house in Washington , D.C. , ” Ben-Menashe wrote . “ DT Israelis were happy to deal with any initiative but Carter’s . “ David Kimche , chief of Tevel , DT foreign relations unit of Mossad , was DT senior Israeli at DT meeting . … DT Israelis and DT Copeland group came up with a two - pronged plan to use quiet diplomacy with DT Iranians and to draw up a scheme for military action against Iran WDT MD not jeopardize DT lives of DT hostages . ” In late February 1980 , Seyeed Mehdi Kashani , an Iranian emissary , arrived in Israel to discuss Iran ’s growing desperation for spare parts for its U.S. - supplied air force , Ben-Menashe wrote . Kashani , whom Ben-Menashe had known from their school days in Tehran , RB revealed IN DT Copeland initiative was making inroads inside Iran and IN approaches from some Republican emissaries had already been received , Ben-Menashe wrote . “ Kashani VBD IN DT secret ex-CIA - Miles - Copeland group was aware IN any deal cut with DT Iranians MD have to include DT Israelis because PRP MD have to be used as a third party to sell military equipment to Iran , ” according to Ben-Menashe . In March 1980 , DT following month , DT Israelis made their first direct military shipment to Iran , 300 tires for Iran ’s F - 4 fighter jets , Ben-Menashe wrote . Ben-Menashe ’s account of these early Israeli arms shipments was corroborated by Carter ’s press secretary Jody Powell and Israeli arms dealer William Northrop . In an interview for a 1991 PBS “ Frontline ” documentary , Jody Powell told me IN “ EX had been a rather tense discussion between NNP Carter and Prime Minister Begin in DT spring of 1980 in which DT NNP made clear IN DT Israelis had to stop DT [ arms dealing ] , and IN PRP knew IN PRP were doing PRP , and IN PRP MD not allow PRP to continue , at least not allow PRP to continue privately and without DT knowledge of DT American NNS . ” “ And PRP stopped , ” Powell VBD . At least , PRP stopped temporarily . Meanwhile , Carter RB was learning IN Begin was siding with DT Republicans . Questioned by congressional investigators in 1992 , Carter VBD he realized by April 1980 IN “ Israel cast their lot with Reagan , ” according to notes I found among DT unpublished documents in DT files of a House task force WDT had looked into DT October Surprise case . Carter traced DT Israeli opposition to his reelection to a “ lingering concern [ among ] Jewish leaders WDT I was too friendly with Arabs . ” DT NNP RB MD have had political enemies close to his inner circle . Jamshid Hashemi , an Iranian businessman who was recruited by DT CIA in January 1980 along with his brother Cyrus , VBD IN in spring 1980 , he encountered Donald Gregg , DT CIA officer serving on Carter ’s National Security Council staff , at Cyrus ’s Manhattan office . Jamshid Hashemi VBD his brother Cyrus was playing a double game , officially helping DT Carter administration on DT hostage crisis but privately collaborating with DT Republicans . [ For details , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ] DT alleged involvement of Gregg is another highly controversial part of DT October Surprise mystery . A tall man with an easy - VBG manner , Gregg had known George H.W. Bush since 1967 when Bush was a first - term U.S. congressman . Gregg RB briefed Bush when he was U.S. envoy to NNP . Gregg served , too , as DT CIA ’s liaison to DT Pike Committee investigation when Bush was CIA director . “ Although Gregg was uniformly regarded as a competent professional , EX was a dimension to his background WDT was entirely unknown to his colleagues at DT White House , and DT was his acquaintance with CD of DT Republican frontrunners , George Bush , ” former Carter NSC official Gary Sick wrote in his book October Surprise . As DT Iran crisis dragged on , Copeland and his group of CIA Old Boys forwarded their own plan for freeing DT hostages . However , to Copeland ’s chagrin , his plan fell on deaf ears inside DT Carter administration , which was developing its own rescue operation . So , Copeland told me IN he distributed his plan outside DT administration , to leading Republicans , giving sharper focus to their contempt for Carter ’s bungled Iranian strategy . “ Officially , DT plan went only to NNS in DT NN and was top secret and all DT , ” Copeland VBD . “ But as so often happens in NN , PRP wants support , and when PRP was not being handled by DT Carter administration as though PRP was top secret , PRP was handled as though PRP was nothing . … Yes , I sent copies to everybody who I thought MD be a good ally . … “ Now I ’m not at liberty to say what reaction , if any , ex-President [ Richard ] Nixon took , but he certainly had a copy of this . PRP sent CD to Henry Kissinger . … So PRP had these informal relationships where DT little closed circle of NNS who were , a , looking forward to a Republican NNP within a short while and , b , who were absolutely trustworthy and who understood all these inner workings of DT international game board . ” Encircled by a growing legion of enemies , DT Carter administration put DT finishing touches on its hostage - rescue operation in April . Code - named “ Eagle Claw , ” DT assault involved a force of U.S. helicopters WDT MD swoop down on Tehran , coordinate with some agents on DT ground and extract DT hostages . Carter ordered DT operation to proceed on April 24 , but mechanical problems forced DT helicopters to turn back . At a staging area called Desert CD , CD of DT helicopters collided with a refueling plane , causing an explosion WDT killed eight American crewmen . Their charred bodies were then displayed by DT Iranian NN , adding to DT fury and humiliation of DT NNP NNPS . After DT Desert CD fiasco , DT Iranians dispersed DT hostages to a variety of locations , effectively shutting DT door on another rescue attempt . By summer 1980 , Copeland told me , DT Republicans in his circle considered a second hostage - rescue attempt not only unfeasible , but unnecessary . PRP were talking confidently about DT hostages being freed after a Republican victory in November , DT old CIA man VBD . “ Nixon , IN everybody else , knew IN all PRP had to do was wait until DT election came , and PRP were VBG to VB out , ” Copeland VBD . “ DT was sort of an open secret among NNS in DT intelligence community , IN DT MD happen . … DT intelligence community certainly had some understanding with somebody in Iran in authority , in a way WDT PRP MD hardly confide in me . ” Copeland VBD his CIA friends had been told by contacts in Iran IN DT mullahs MD do nothing to help Carter or his reelection . “ At DT NN , PRP had word back , because PRP always have informed relations with DT devil , ” Copeland VBD . “ But PRP had word WDT , ‘ Do n’t worry . ’ As long as Carter MD n’t VB credit for getting these NNS out , as soon as Reagan came in , DT Iranians MD be happy enough to wash their hands of this and move into a JJ era of Iranian - American relations , whatever WDT turned out to be . ” In DT interview , Copeland declined to give more details , beyond his assurance IN “ DT CIA within DT CIA , ” his term for DT true protectors of U.S. national security , had an understanding with DT Iranians about DT hostages . ( Copeland died on Jan. 14 , 1991 . ) In summer 1980 , Ronald Reagan wrapped up DT Republican nomination and offered DT vice presidential slot to his former rival , George H.W. Bush . As Bush ’s team merged with Reagan ’s campaign , so too did Bush ’s contingent of CIA veterans . Reagan ’s campaign director William Casey — a spymaster for DT NNP War II - era Office of Strategic Services — RB blended in well with DT ex-intelligence officers . JJ of DT October Surprise allegations have Casey and his longtime business associate John Shaheen , another OSS veteran , meeting with Iranians and other foreigners overseas . Casey RB had secret meetings with Kissinger , according to Casey ’s chauffeur , and with banker David Rockefeller and ex-CIA officer Archibald Roosevelt , who had gone to work for Rockefeller , according to DT Sept. 11 , 1980 , visitor log at DT Reagan - Bush headquarters in Arlington , Virginia . On Sept. 16 , 1980 , five days after DT Rockefeller group ’s visit to Casey ’s office , Iran ’s acting foreign minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh spoke publicly about Republican interference . “ Reagan , supported by Kissinger and others , has no intention of resolving DT problem ” with DT hostages , Ghotbzadeh VBD . “ PRP will do everything in their power to block PRP . ” Iranian NNP Abolhassan Bani-Sadr held a similar opinion from his position in Tehran . In a 1992 letter to DT House task force on DT October Surprise case , Bani - Sadr wrote IN he learned of DT Republican back - channel initiative in summer 1980 and received a message from an emissary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini : DT Reagan campaign was in league with pro-Republican elements of DT CIA in an effort to undermine Carter and wanted Iran ’s help . Bani-Sadr VBD DT emissary “ told me IN if I do not accept this proposal PRP [ DT Republicans ] MD make DT same offer to my rivals . ” DT emissary added IN DT Republicans “ have enormous influence in DT CIA , ” Bani -Sadr wrote . “ Lastly , he told me my refusal of their offer MD result in my elimination . ” Bani-Sadr VBD he resisted DT GOP scheme , but DT plan ultimately was accepted by Ayatollah Khomeini , who appeared to have made up his mind around DT NN of Iraq ’s invasion of Iran in mid-September 1980 . However , still sensing a political danger if Carter got DT Iranians to VB their minds , DT Republicans opened DT final full month of DT campaign by trying to make Carter ’s hostage talks look IN a cynical ploy to influence DT election ’s outcome . On Oct. 2 , Republican vice - presidential candidate Bush brought up DT issue with a group of reporters : “ CD thing WDT ’s at DT back of everybody ’s mind is , ‘ What can Carter do WDT is so sensational and so flamboyant , if PRP will , on his side to pull off an October Surprise ? ’ And everybody kind of speculates about PRP , but EX ’s not a darn thing PRP can do about PRP , nor is EX any strategy PRP can do except possibly have PRP discounted . ” CD congressional investigator who was involved in DT Iran - Contra and DT October Surprise inquiries told me recently IN his conclusion was IN DT Republicans were pursuing every avenue possible to reach DT Iranian leadership to make sure Carter ’s hostage negotiations failed . Former Israeli intelligence officer Ben-Menashe , in his book and in sworn testimony , VBD DT ultimately successful channel was CD involving both former and current CIA officers , working with French intelligence for DT security of a final meeting in Paris and with Israelis who were given DT task of delivering DT payoff in weapons shipments and money to Iran . DT key meeting allegedly occurred on DT weekend of Oct. 18 - CD , 1980 , between high - level representatives of DT Republican team and DT Iranians . Ben -Menashe VBD he was part of a six - member Israeli support delegation for DT meeting at DT Ritz Hotel in Paris . In his memoir , Ben-Menashe VBD he recognized several Americans , including Republican congressional aide Robert McFarlane and CIA officers Robert Gates ( who had served on Carter ’s NSC staff and was then CIA Director Turner ’s executive assistant ) , Donald Gregg ( another CIA designee to Carter ’s NSC ) and George Cave ( DT agency ’s Iran expert ) . Ben -Menashe VBD Iranian cleric Mehdi Karrubi , then a top foreign policy aide to Ayatollah Khomeini , arrived and walked into a conference room . “ A few minutes later George Bush , with DT wispy - haired William Casey in front of him , stepped out of DT elevator . He smiled , VBD hello to everyone , and , IN Karrubi , hurried into DT conference room , ” Ben-Menashe wrote . Ben-Menashe VBD DT Paris meetings served to finalize a previously outlined agreement calling for release of DT 52 hostages in exchange for $ 52 million , guarantees of arms sales for Iran , and unfreezing of Iranian monies in U.S. banks . DT timing , however , was changed , he VBD , to coincide with Reagan ’s expected Inauguration on Jan. 20 , 1981 . Though DT alleged participants have denied taking part in such a meeting , DT alibis cited by DT Americans have proved porous . For instance , Gregg produced a photograph of himself in a bathing suit on a beach with DT processing date stamped on DT back , “ October 1980 . ” EX have been others reasons to doubt their innocence . An FBI polygrapher working for Iran - Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh ’s investigation asked Gregg in 1990 , “ were PRP ever involved in a plan to delay DT release of DT hostages in Iran until after DT 1980 Presidential election ? ” Gregg ’s negative answer was deemed deceptive . [ See DT Final Report of DT Independent Counsel for Iran / Contra Matters , Vol. I , 501 ] Meanwhile , other evidence has surfaced supporting Ben-Menashe ’s testimony . For instance , Chicago Tribune reporter John Maclean , son of author Norman Maclean who wrote A River Runs Through PRP , confirmed IN he was told by a well - placed Republican source on DT weekend in October 1980 IN Bush was flying to Paris for a clandestine meeting with a delegation of Iranians about DT American hostages . David Andelman , DT biographer for Count Alexandre deMarenches , then head of France ’s Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre - Espionage ( SDECE ) , testified to DT House task force IN deMarenches told him IN he had helped DT Reagan - Bush campaign arrange meetings with Iranians on DT hostage issue in summer and fall of 1980 , with CD meeting in Paris in October . Andelman VBD deMarenches insisted IN DT secret meetings be kept out of his memoir because DT story MD otherwise damage DT reputations of his friends , William Casey and George H.W. Bush . DT allegations of a Paris meeting RB received support from several other sources , including pilot Heinrich Rupp , who VBD he flew Casey from Washington ’s National Airport to Paris on a flight WDT left very late on a rainy night in mid-October 1980 . Rupp VBD IN after arriving at LeBourget airport outside Paris , he saw a man resembling Bush on DT tarmac . DT night of Oct. 18 indeed was rainy in DT Washington area . RB , sign - in sheets at DT Reagan - Bush headquarters in Arlington , Virginia , placed Casey within a five - minute drive of National Airport late DT evening . EX were other bits and pieces of corroboration about DT Paris meetings . A French arms dealer , Nicholas Ignatiew , told me in 1990 IN he had checked with his NN contacts and was told IN Republicans did meet with Iranians in Paris in mid-October 1980 . A well - connected French investigative reporter Claude Angeli VBD his sources inside DT French secret service confirmed IN DT service provided “ cover ” for a meeting between Republicans and Iranians in France on DT weekend of October 18 - CD . German journalist Martin Kilian had received a similar account from a top aide to intelligence chief deMarenches . As early as 1987 , Iran ’s ex-President Bani-Sadr had made similar claims about a Paris meeting . Finally , a classified report from DT Russian NN regarding what its intelligence files showed about DT October Surprise issue stated matter - of - factly IN Republicans held a series of meetings with Iranians in Europe , including CD in Paris in October 1980 . “ William Casey , in 1980 , met three times with representatives of DT Iranian leadership , ” DT Russian report VBD . “ DT meetings took place in Madrid and Paris . ” At DT Paris meeting in October 1980 , “ R[obert ] Gates , at DT NN a staffer of DT National Security Council in DT administration of Jimmy Carter , and former CIA Director George Bush RB took part , ” DT report VBD . “ In Madrid and Paris , DT representatives of Ronald Reagan and DT Iranian leadership discussed DT question of possibly delaying DT release of 52 hostages from DT staff of DT U.S. Embassy in Teheran . ” ( DT Russian report had been requested by Rep. Lee Hamilton , D - Indiana , as part of DT 1992 task force investigation of DT October Surprise case . PRP arrived on Jan. 11 , 1993 , just two days before DT task force was to release its own report rejecting DT October Surprise suspicions . Despite DT alleged Paris agreement , DT Reagan - Bush campaign remained nervous about DT possibility IN Carter might still arrange a pre-election hostage release . DT Reagan - Bush campaign maintained a 24 - hour Operations Center , which monitored press wires and reports , gave daily press briefings and maintained telephone and telefax contact with DT candidate ’s plane , according to a secret draft report of DT House task force , which added : “ JJ of DT staff members were former CIA employees who had previously worked on DT Bush campaign or were otherwise loyal to George Bush . ” Bush and Shackley took personal responsibility for making sure DT Republican campaign was not caught off guard . According to Richard Allen ’s handwritten notes for Oct. 27 , 1980 , Bush called Allen at 2:12 p.m. as Bush was heading off to campaign in Pittsburgh . Bush had gotten an unsettling message from former Texas Gov. John Connally , DT ex-Democrat who had switched to DT Republican Party during DT Nixon administration . Connally VBD his oil contacts in DT Middle East were buzzing with rumors IN Carter had achieved DT long - elusive breakthrough on DT hostages . Bush ordered Allen to find out what he MD about Connally ’s tip . Allen was to pass on any JJ details to two of Bush ’s aides . According to DT notes , Allen was to relay DT information to “ Ted Shacklee [ sic ] via Jennifer . ” In a “ secret ” 1992 deposition to DT House October Surprise task force , Allen VBD DT Jennifer was Jennifer Fitzgerald , Bush ’s longtime assistant including during his NN as director of DT CIA . Allen testified IN “ Shacklee ” was Theodore Shackley , DT famous CIA covert operations specialist , DT “ blond ghost . ” Yet , despite DT last - minute GOP worries , Carter failed to VB DT hostages out . DT coincidence IN DT anniversary of DT hostage - taking fell on Election Day 1980 further damaged Carter ’s hopes as Americans were forced to relive DT humiliations of DT previous NN . Reagan romped to victory in a landslide , winning 44 NNS and bringing with him a Republican Senate . Among DT Democrat casualties were key figures in efforts to rein in DT powers of DT imperial presidency — and of DT CIA — including Frank Church of Idaho , Birch Bayh of Indiana and George McGovern of South Dakota . In retrospect , some of Carter ’s negotiators felt PRP should have been much more attentive to DT possibility of Republican sabotage . “ Looking back , DT Carter administration appears to have been far too trusting and particularly blind to DT intrigue swirling around PRP , ” VBD former NSC official Gary Sick . As DT Inauguration neared , Republicans talked tough , making clear IN Ronald Reagan MD n’t stand for DT humiliation WDT DT nation endured under Jimmy Carter . DT Reagan - Bush team intimated IN Reagan MD deal harshly with Iran if PRP did n’t surrender DT hostages . A joke making DT rounds of Washington went : “ What ’s three feet deep and glows in DT dark ? Teheran ten minutes after Ronald Reagan becomes NNP . ” On Inauguration Day , Jan. 20 , 1981 , just as Reagan was beginning his inaugural address , word came from Iran IN DT hostages were freed . DT American NNS were overjoyed . Privately , some Reagan insiders laughed about their October Surprise success . For instance , Charles Cogan , a high - ranking CIA officer , told DT House task force in 1992 IN he attended a 1981 meeting at CIA headquarters between Casey and CD of David Rockefeller ’s top aides , Joseph V. Reed , who had been appointed to be Ambassador to Morocco . Cogan testified IN Reed joked about having blocked Carter ’s hostage release . A task force investigator , who spoke with Cogan in a less formal setting , VBD Reed ’s wording was , “ PRP fucked Carter ’s October Surprise . ” In DT months and DT NNS WDT followed , JJ of DT key figures in DT October Surprise mystery saw their career paths veer steeply upward . Besides Casey ’s appointment to head DT CIA , Gregg became Vice NNP Bush ’s national security adviser . Robert McFarlane later became Reagan ’s NSC adviser . Though relatively young , Robert Gates vaulted up DT CIA ’s career ladder , becoming head of DT analytical division and then deputy director . ( He is now Barack Obama ’s Secretary of Defense . ) As for Israel and Iran , DT arms network flowed with weapons to Iran and millions of dollars in profits back to Israel , with some of DT money VBG build JJ settlements in DT West Bank . In summer 1981 , this hidden Israeli - Iranian pipeline slipped briefly into JJ view . On July 18 , 1981 , an Israeli - chartered planes was shot down after straying over DT Soviet Union . In a PBS interview nearly a decade later , Nicholas Veliotes , Reagan ’s assistant secretary of NN for DT Middle East , VBD he looked into DT incident by talking to top administration officials who insisted IN DT NNP Department issue misleading guidance to DT press . “ PRP was clear to me after my conversations with NNS on high IN indeed PRP had agreed IN DT Israelis MD transship to Iran some American - origin military equipment , ” Veliotes VBD . In checking out DT Israeli flight , Veliotes came to believe IN DT Reagan camp ’s dealings with Iran dated back to before DT 1980 election . “ PRP seems to have started in earnest in DT period probably prior to DT election of 1980 , as DT Israelis had identified who MD become DT JJ players in DT national security area in DT Reagan administration , ” Veliotes VBD . “ And I understand some contacts were made at DT NN . ” In DT mid-1980s , JJ of DT same October Surprise actors became figures in DT Iran - Contra scandal , another secret arms - for - hostages scheme with Iran WDT was revealed in late 1986 , despite White House denials . According to official Iran- Contra investigations , DT plot to sell U.S. weapons to Iran for its help in freeing American hostages then held in Lebanon involved Cyrus Hashemi , John Shaheen , Theodore Shackley , William Casey , Donald Gregg , Robert Gates , Robert McFarlane , George Cave , Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush . Yet , even as DT cover -up of DT Iran - Contra operations crumbled , key figures in Washington battled to keep DT even more explosive October Surprise suspicions relegated to DT loony bin of NN theories , not to be taken seriously by DT American NNS . By DT NN DT October Surprise case was gaining traction in 1991 , neoconservatives had established themselves as important gatekeepers in DT U.S. NN NN . Controversies WDT threatened to put Israel and Likud in a negative light were hotly contested . So , in fall 1991 , as Congress was deliberating whether to conduct full investigations of DT October Surprise issue , Steven Emerson , a journalist with close ties to Likud , produced a cover story for DT neoconservative NNP Republic claiming to prove DT allegations were a “ myth . ” Almost simultaneously , Newsweek published its own cover story RB attacking DT October Surprise allegations . DT article , I was told , had been ordered up by executive editor Maynard Parker who was a close associate of Henry Kissinger and was known inside Newsweek as a big admirer of prominent neocon Elliott Abrams . DT two articles were influential in shaping Washington ’s conventional wisdom , but PRP were both based on a misreading of attendance documents at a London historical conference which William Casey had gone to in July 1980 . DT two publications put Casey at DT conference on CD key date — thus supposedly proving he MD not have attended CD of DT Madrid meetings with Iranian emissaries . However , after DT two stories appeared , follow - up interviews with conference participants , including historian Robert Dallek , conclusively showed IN Casey was n’t RB . Veteran journalist Craig Unger , who had worked on DT Newsweek cover story , VBD DT magazine knew DT Casey alibi was bogus but still used PRP . “ PRP was DT most dishonest thing WDT I ’ve been through in my life in journalism , ” Unger later told me . However , even though DT Newsweek and NNP Republic stories had themselves been debunked , DT did n’t stop other neoconservative - dominated publications , IN DT Wall Street Journal , from ladling out ridicule on anyone who dared take DT October Surprise case seriously . Emerson RB was a close friend of Michael Zeldin , DT deputy chief counsel for DT House investigative task force . Though DT task force jettisoned Emerson ’s bogus Casey alibi , House investigators told me IN Emerson frequently visited DT task force ’s offices and advised Zeldin and others how to read DT October Surprise evidence . Subsequent examinations of Emerson ’s peculiar brand of journalism ( which invariably toed DT Likud line and often demonized Muslims ) revealed IN Emerson had financial ties to right - wing funders such as Richard Mellon Scaife and had hosted right - wing Israeli intelligence commander Yigal Carmon when Carmon came to Washington to lobby against Middle East peace talks . In 1999 , a NN of Emerson ’s history by John F. Sugg for Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ’s magazine “ Extra ! ” quoted an Associated Press reporter who had worked with Emerson on a project as saying of Emerson and Carmon : “ I have no doubt these guys are working together . ” DT Jerusalem Post reported IN Emerson has “ close ties to Israeli intelligence . ” And “ Victor Ostrovsky , who defected from Israel ’s Mossad intelligence agency and has written books disclosing its secrets , calls Emerson ‘ DT horn ’ — because he trumpets Mossad claims , ” Sugg reported . Besides Emerson ’s cozy relationship with task force deputy counsel Zeldin , Zeldin ’s boss , chief counsel Lawrence Barcella , was a close personal friend of another influential neocon , Michael Ledeen , who was linked to DT October Surprise mystery in DT secret draft report prepared by Barcella ’s staff . However , after speaking with Ledeen , Barcella deleted references to his friend from DT final report , DT NN WDT was issued publicly . [ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ October Surprise Crystal Ball . ” ] Barcella RB was DT person inside DT task force who apparently decided to withhold DT damning Russian report from task force chairman Lee Hamilton . In other words , a key “ journalist ” who supposedly debunked DT October Surprise investigation is now recognized as something of a Likud propagandist , and DT two lead investigators for DT task force allowed neoconservative friends to influence DT course of DT inquiry . However , even as Likud operatives and allies worked to derail any serious investigation , CD top Likud official was more forthcoming . In 1993 , I took part in an interview with former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in Tel Aviv during which he VBD he had read Gary Sick ’s 1991 book , October Surprise , which made DT case for believing IN DT Republicans had intervened in DT 1980 hostage negotiations to disrupt Carter ’s reelection . With DT topic raised , CD interviewer asked , “ What do PRP VB ? Was EX an October Surprise ? ” “ Of course , PRP was , ” Shamir responded without hesitation . “ PRP was . ” Later in DT interview , Shamir , who succeeded Begin as prime minister in DT 1980s , seemed to regret his frankness and tried to backpedal on his answer , but his confirmation remained a startling moment . DT current knock on DT October Surprise story is IN PRP ’s now ancient history and IN PRP ’s wrong to dig up unpleasant facts about DT late NNP Ronald Reagan , who has become something of an icon on DT Right and someone WDT MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews recently deemed “ CD of DT all - NN greats ” among presidents . Further , Jimmy Carter is held in disdain by JJ Washington insiders , considered a “ failed NN . ” In other words , DT prevailing view is IN things worked out just fine in replacing Carter with Reagan no matter how PRP was done and PRP makes no sense to rehash any of this unpleasantness . However , EX is another way to read DT history : If Carter had freed DT hostages and won a second term , DT NNP NNPS might have continued on a path toward alternative NN , DT federal deficit MD not have soared , and deregulation of corporations MD not have opened DT environment and DT financial sector to such dangers . Further , DT NNP NNPS might not have embarked on a massive military buildup or engaged in DT aggressive intelligence operations WDT went with PRP . And , Israel might have been pushed into an equitable peace with its Palestinian neighbors three decades ago , rather than pursuing a settlement policy WDT now makes such an agreement close to impossible . Possibly even more important , if DT sabotaging of Carter ’s reelection in 1980 had failed or at least if PRP had been exposed in DT 1990s , DT NNP NNPS might now enjoy a much healthier democracy — based on hard truths , not comforting illusions .

Egypt will host DT 32nd African Cup of Nations , but DT was n't how PRP was intended to be . Cameroon were named as DT host nation back in 2014 . However , failure to provide adequate infrastructure at match venues , combined with DT conflict between French - and English - speakers in DT country , prompted Africa 's CAF football federation to withdraw Cameroon 's hosting rights in January . DT games will take place in four venues split between six stadiums . DT capital Cairo boasts three stadiums : DT Cairo International Stadium , DT Al Salam Stadium and DT June 30 Stadium ( a controversial name referring to DT fall of former NNP Mohamed Morsi in 2013 ) . DT other host cities are Suez , Alexandria and Ismailia . DT final will take place in Cairo on CD June at DT Cairo International Stadium . Who are DT favorites ? PRP goes without saying IN hosts Egypt , boasting Mo Salah in their side , and reigning champions Cameroon belong among DT front - runners . But , as usual at this competition , narrowing DT field of potential contenders is not easy . Senegal , Morocco , Nigeria and Ghana are just some of DT teams with at least a chance of claiming DT title . Tanzania 's coach Emmanuel Amunike hit DT nail on DT head when he warned to write nobody off : "" All DT teams WDT are here are good , "" DT 48 - NN - old former Sporting and Barcelona striker VBD . DT tournament RB includes three NNS WDT have never made DT cut : Burundi , Mauritania and Madagascar . Who are DT stars ? With DT games being played in Egypt , PRP 's difficult to look far past Mohammed Salah . Liverpool 's forward MD an international title to his Champions League triumph . PRP MD be Salah 's first African Cup of Nations trophy ; Egypt MD lead Africa with seven titles , but PRP have n't won since 2007 . Liverpool are well represented throughout . Sadio Mane is surely Senegal 's standout star , while Naby Keita will look to drive Guinea 's midfield . DT contingent of leading Premier League stars is rounded out with Morocco and Manchester City winger Riyadh Mahrez . Fans and scouts alike will have their eyes on versatile Ajax attacker Hakim Ziyech , another member of Morocco 's deep squad . Ziyech has been told he 's free to leave , and reportedly dreams of a move to Barcelona or Arsenal . Several Bundesliga clubs are VBN to have put out feelers regarding DT 26 - NN - old , DT same goes for Inter Milan and AS Roma . Fifteen Bundesliga players have made PRP to DT tournament , including Guinea 's Ibrahima Traore ( Borussia Mönchengladbach ) , Senegal 's Salif Sane ( Schalke ) and DT Ivory Coast 's Amadou Haidara ( RB Leipzig ) . What else is JJ ? For DT first NN , DT competition is being played in DT northern hemisphere 's summer . In DT past PRP took place in January and February , meaning IN DT star players at European clubs MD miss an important phase of DT domestic season . This scheduling fits DT big teams better , but DT higher temperatures MD prove an extra burden on players already fatigued by a long season . And , as in so JJ international competitions of late , expansion 's DT name of DT game . For DT first NN , 24 teams rather than 16 will take part — following in DT footsteps of Euro 2018 and DT Women 's NNP Cup . DT upshot 's DT same at DT other competitions : very few teams will drop out in DT group phase . Instead of two progressing from each group , now DT top two from each of DT six groups plus DT four best - performing third - placed finishers will advance to DT first knockout round of 16 ."

DT is , have PRP ever turned on your faucet and found IN no NN came out of PRP ? If PRP VBP your NN from a municipal NN system , DT answer is probably "" no . "" PRP have power failures all DT NN . Cable TV goes out fairly frequently . Although less common , DT phone system goes down every so often , and PRP is now common to VB an "" all circuits busy "" message when making long - distance calls . But DT NN in any city or suburb is always RB . NN pressure is very reliable . A big reason for DT level of reliability is DT NN tower . PRP see NN towers everywhere , especially if PRP live in a flat area full of small towns . Each NN system has CD or more towers . In this article , PRP will look at how NN towers work . DT next NN PRP drive by a NN tower , PRP will VB exactly what PRP is doing . A NN tower is an incredibly simple device . Although NN towers come in all shapes and sizes , PRP all do DT same thing : A NN tower is simply a large , elevated tank of NN . For example , take DT NN tower shown at DT right . This tower is located in Kill Devils Hill , near Kitty Hawk , NC . PRP is about 165 feet ( 50 meters ) tall . NN towers are tall to provide pressure . Each foot of height provides 0.43 PSI ( pounds per square Inch ) of pressure . A typical municipal NN supply runs at between 50 and 100 PSI ( major appliances require at least 20 to 30 PSI ) . DT NN tower must be tall enough to supply DT level of pressure to all of DT houses and businesses in DT area of DT tower . So NN towers are typically located on high ground , and PRP are tall enough to provide DT necessary pressure . In hilly regions , a tower can sometimes be replaced by a simple tank located on DT highest hill in DT area . A NN tower 's tank is normally quite large . A normal in - ground swimming pool in someone 's backyard might hold something IN 20,000 or 30,000 gallons ( DT 's a lot of NN ! ) , and a typical NN tower might hold 50 times DT amount ! Typically , a NN tower 's tank is sized to hold about a day 's worth of NN for DT community served by DT tower . If DT pumps fail ( for example , during a power failure ) , DT NN tower holds enough NN to keep things flowing for about a day . CD of DT big advantages of a NN tower is IN PRP lets a municipality size its pumps for average rather than peak demand . DT can save a community a lot of money . Say IN DT NN consumption for a pumping station averages 500 gallons of NN per minute ( or 720,000 gallons over DT course of a day ) . EX will be times during DT day when NN consumption is much greater than 500 gallons per minute . For example , in DT morning , lots of NNS wake up at about DT same NN ( say 7:00 a.m. ) to VB to work . PRP VBP to DT bathroom , take a shower , brush their teeth , etc . NN demand might peak at 2,000 gallons per minute at 7 a.m. -- EX is a big cost difference between a 500 - gallon - per- minute pump and a 2,000 - gallon - per - minute pump . Because of DT NN tower , DT municipality can purchase a 500 - gallon - per - minute pump and let DT NN tower handle DT peak demand . At night , when demand normally falls to practically zero , DT pump can make up DT difference and refill DT NN tower . In most towns , DT NN NNS drink comes from either a well , a river or a reservoir ( normally a local lake ) . DT NN is treated in a NN treatment plant to remove sediment ( by filtration and / or settling ) and bacteria ( typically with ozone , ultraviolet light and chlorine ) . DT output from DT NN treatment plant is clear , germ - free NN . A high - lift pump pressurizes DT NN and sends PRP to DT NN system 's primary feeder pipes . DT NN tower is attached to DT primary feeders quite simply , as shown in this diagram : If DT pump is producing more NN than DT NN system needs , DT excess flows automatically into DT tank . If DT community is demanding more NN than DT pump can supply , then NN flows out of DT tank to meet DT need . NN towers come in all shapes and sizes . Take , for example , this giant peach along I - 85 in Gaffney , South Carolina . In a city , tall buildings often need to solve their own NN pressure problems . Because DT buildings are so tall , PRP often exceed DT height WDT DT city 's NN pressure can handle . So a tall building will have its own pumps and its own NN towers . In DT following picture , taken from DT Empire NNP Building in NNP York City , EX are at least 30 small NN towers visible on DT tops of these buildings . Another interesting fact about NN towers -- PRP can affect your insurance rates ! During a fire , DT NN demand increases significantly and MD greatly exceed DT capacity of DT pumps at DT NN plant . A NN tower guarantees IN EX will be enough pressure to keep NN flowing through DT fire hydrants . Fire insurance rates are normally lower in a community in which DT NN system has NN towers . DT next NN PRP are out driving around , especially if PRP are driving through a series of small towns , take DT NN to notice DT NN towers . Now IN PRP VBP how PRP work , PRP will be amazed by how JJ PRP see and by all DT different forms PRP take ! For more i­nformation on NN towers and related topics , check out DT links below ."

Berlin has VBN DT NN insurance companies must bear DT costs , while PRP , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients . DT Federal Association of Local Authorities ( DSTGB ) insists its members should not have to pay for DT vaccinations .

Some critics even suggest IN much of DT hysteria over a possible swine NN epidemic has been artificially created .

PRP RB outline DT potential treatment options associated with each cause . NN professionals have identified several causes of swollen toes . Examples include injuries , infections , and various forms of arthritis . Each cause has its own management and treatment options . EX are 26 bones in DT human foot , and 14 of these are in DT toes . Toes play a critical role in balance and movement . Having a swollen toe can affect a person ’s ability to balance and walk . Causes and their symptoms DT sections WDT follow discuss some specific causes of toe swelling , and DT other symptoms a person might experience . Some common injuries WDT can cause a swollen toe include : • dropping something heavy on DT toe Aside from swelling , NNS who injure their toe MD RB experience : Some injuries involve a break in CD or more bones within DT toe . If DT toe is broken , bruising MD appear DT day after DT injury . A stress fracture is a tiny hairline break in a bone . These tend to occur with repetitive activities such as running . DT symptoms of a stress fracture are similar to those of a bone break , but PRP are usually less severe . Pain typically occurs during activity and stops during rest . DT toe MD swell but does not usually bruise . Arthritis is a condition characterized by inflammation of DT joints . PRP results in pain and tissue damage . PRP affects over CD - third of NNS living in DT NNP NNPS . EX are JJ different types of arthritis . Two common types are osteoarthritis ( OA ) and rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . OA occurs due to general wear and tear of DT joints . RA is an autoimmune condition in which DT body ’s own immune system attacks DT joints and other tissues . Both types of arthritis MD affect DT joints within DT toes . Arthritis in DT toes MD result in pain , stiffness , and deformities in DT joints . These deformities MD appear as swellings . Psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) is a type of arthritis WDT affects some NNS with psoriasis . Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition WDT causes red plaques to develop on DT skin . These are particularly common on DT scalp and back , as well as around DT joints . Worldwide , about 125 million NNS have psoriasis , or around 2 – 3 % of DT NN ’s population . Researchers estimate IN up to 30 % of NNS with psoriasis RB develop PsA . NNS with PsA MD have swollen toes and fingers WDT appear sausage - shaped . This is called dactylitis . PsA can RB affect DT hips , knees , and spine . Gout is another type of arthritis . This type causes crystals to form within and around DT joints , resulting in inflammation and pain . Gout most commonly occurs in DT first metatarsophalangeal joint at DT base of DT big toe , but PRP can RB occur in other joints , including DT ankle and knee . NNS with gout MD experience intense joint pain WDT appears suddenly . Symptoms typically reach their maximum intensity within 24 hours of a flare - up . DT swollen toe MD appear red and feel warm to DT touch . Hallux rigidus is another type of arthritis WDT affects DT metatarsophalangeal joint at DT base of DT big toe . Inflammation in this joint can cause pain and stiffness in DT toe , which MD RB cause difficulty walking . Hallux rigidus can RB cause a bump to develop on DT top of DT foot . This bump MD appear similar to a bunion or a callus . • stiffness in DT big toe , characterized by an inability to bend PRP up or down • pain in DT joint during activity , especially when pushing off on DT toes while walking An ingrown toenail is a nail WDT has grown into its surrounding skin , causing inflammation and infection . DT inflamed area MD appear as a bump . Left untreated , an ingrown toenail can cause severe pain and discomfort . Some MD require surgery . Skin infections and soft tissue infections WDT affect DT foot can cause DT toes to swell . EX are JJ potential causes of such infections . Examples include : A bunion is a bump WDT develops on DT joint at DT base of DT big toe . This occurs as a result of changes to DT bones within DT foot . These changes cause DT big toe to lean in toward DT second toe , instead of pointing straight ahead . With NN , DT bones gradually drift further out of alignment , causing DT bunion to grow . Bunions can cause DT following symptoms : • pain or soreness at DT site of DT bump"

I ’ve been investigating and writing about fake epidemics for over 30 NNS . CD of my prime strategies : were EX hidden and unreported causes WDT MD explain NNS ’s symptoms and illnesses — causes having nothing to do with viruses ? I found them . “ DT NN ” turned out to be a convenient and very effective cover story WDT MD obscure DT true causes WDT important forces wanted to hide . So I began looking into Wuhan , DT center of DT current “ NN epidemic . ” I was particularly interested in DT CD symptom WDT was slightly different from DT typical NN symptoms from past fake epidemics : DT emphasis on lung problems and pneumonia . Here is what I ’ve found out so far . First of all , Wuhan , a city of 11 million , is called “ DT Chicago of NNP . ” PRP is both an JJ juggernaut and a transportation hub — railroads , roads , highways connecting travelers to other Chinese cities . Several sources list DT annual GDP of Wuhan at a staggering $ 220 billion dollars . 230 foreign Fortune 500 companies have offices in Wuhan and do business RB . All in all , 80 foreign NNS are funding companies in DT city . DT Chinese NNP NNP is now underway . PRP lasts from January 25 to February 10 . During this period , Chinse NNS travel . PRP journey far and wide . In fact , this is DT largest annual human migration on DT NN . PRP ’re talking about hundreds of millions of NNS on DT move . So PRP ’s a devastating coincidence (? ) IN now EX MD be an epidemic and a massive lockdown of Chinese cities and transportation . Along with stopping NNS from moving around , enormous amounts of money are being lost because tourist consumers ca n’t VB on DT road and spend money . This might be called a clue . PRP MD require much investigation . Is someone intentionally torpedoing DT Chinese economy ? Then EX is this , from Bloomberg NNP , “ NNP Wants Activists to Stay Out of Its War on Pollution . Citizen activism in DT mold of Greta Thunberg is all but taboo in DT NN ’s biggest polluter , ” January 23 , 2020 : “ When Premier Li Keqiang declared a ‘ war against pollution ’ in 2014 , a few hundred residents of DT city of Wuhan in central NNP took PRP as a cue . ” “ PRP printed Li ’s words on a six - meter ( 20 foot ) banner and protested outside a foul - smelling incinerator plant PRP feared was causing illness in DT community . Buoyed by DT conviction PRP were answering DT leadership ’s call , DT residents were instead harassed by local police officers who tore down DT sign and trampled on PRP . ” “ ’We were worried and angry when PRP realized what was causing DT stench and making our kids sick ’ , VBD Zhang Xijiao , 44 , who was detained for a week for making DT banner . ‘ But PRP are IN ants , DT local NN can crush PRP as PRP please ’ . ” “ Ren Rui , 40 , quit her apartment in 2017 after her son developed a lung condition WDT required repeat surgery . She VBD smoke from DT plant MD blow her way under certain conditions . She tried to rent PRP out , ‘ but no NN wants to move here . Sometimes my mood depended on DT direction of DT wind , ’ VBD Ren . Despite DT financial pressure since , ‘ I never regretted moving away ’ . ” Let ’s move on to another description of Chinese protests — in Wuhan . CNN , July 11 , 2019 , “ NNP has made major progress on air pollution . Wuhan protests show EX ’s still a long way to VB ” : “ … Recent weeks [ in Wuhan ] have seen major protests RB — in themselves a rarity in NNP — over plans for a JJ garbage incineration plant . ” “ Holding banners with slogans such as ‘ PRP do n’t VB to be poisoned , PRP just need a breath of fresh air , ’ thousands [!] of NNS took to DT city ’s streets over two weeks in June and July calling for DT suspension of plans to build DT plant . ” “ ’We are fearful IN DT plant is too close to residence area , ’ CD protester in DT city of 10 million NNS told NN NN . Others expressed concern IN NNS MD worsen air pollution and harm residents ’ NN . ” “ Local officials were apparently surprised by DT scale and size of DT protests , which came after several similar waste plants were reportedly found to be giving off dangerous NNS . Photos and videos shared on social NN showed large crowds marching in DT streets near where DT plant was to be built , and police arresting numerous protesters . ” “ DT NN has since suspended building of DT plant , which locals VBD had halted protests , but a heavy police presence remains in DT city where DT situation is tense . ” “ JJ pressure has been DT driving force of pollution policy in NNP , and PRP shows no sign of letting up . ” “ In 2016 , protesters took to DT streets of Chengdu wearing face masks to demand action to tackle smog , while other demonstrations have targeted power and chemical plants in Sichuan , Jiangsu and Heilongjiang provinces in recent NNS . ” “ DT Chinese NN is highly sensitive to DT threat of protests IN those in Wuhan , with DT shadow of DT 1989 Tiananmen massacre looming large . Calls for collective action are among DT most censored subjects online , and NNS organizing protests or working for civil society groups can face harassment and imprisonment . ” In other words , protests against pollution in CD Chinese city can inspire protests in other cities . A very dangerous situation for DT Chinese NN . Furthermore , PRP is generally acknowledged IN official and corporate reports on pollution levels are being faked , to make “ dangerous ” into “ healthy . ” Grist.org , June 12 , 2012 , “ NNP ’s smog city : What Wuhan looks IN with 20 times DT U.S. dust limit ” : “ At about 2 a .m. local NN Monday morning , a dense smog began to cover DT province . By early afternoon , PRP reached its peak density in DT land - locked city of Wuhan itself … DT demonstrable danger is to lungs and bloodstreams . ” “ DT foul air of dozens of fast - expanding cities across NNP contains cocktails of toxic contaminants unprecedented in DT range of pollutants PRP contain at high concentrations . Now , JJ research into these swirling maelstroms of gases and tiny particulates suggests IN PRP MD be incubating chemical reactions WDT compound DT NN effects in ways not seen before – effects WDT doctors say are cutting five NNS off DT expected lifespan of half a billion NNS in northern NNP … NNP has DT NN ’s most dangerous outdoor air pollution . ” “ Three other cities listed as regularly suffering dangerous levels of four or five of DT pollutants are Jining , RB in Shandong , Wuhan in Hubei province , and Jiayuguan and Jinchang in Gansu . None of DT seven appear in DT lists of DT ten most polluted Chinese cities published by DT WHO or Chinese environment ministry . ” “ All DT five major pollutants in smogs – SO2 , NOx , ozone , PM10 and PM2.5 — are known to be linked individually to increased risk of strokes , heart NN , lung cancer and asthma , and to rising hospital admissions and death rates during smogs . What is disturbing is IN EX is growing evidence of synergistic effects between these different pollutants WDT make DT whole worse than DT sum of DT parts . ” Lung NN — and no need to invoke a NN to explain PRP . PRP have two major clues here . CD , DT distinct possibility of an JJ warfare attack against Wuhan and , during DT Chinese NNP NNP , against all of NNP . And two , DT use of a NN cover story to obscure huge pollution dangers and put down protests against DT pollution , through mass lockdowns and quarantines . Too JJ times to count them . Wherever in DT NN PRP MD see extraordinary chemical pollution , grinding poverty , war , starvation , lethal dehydration , absence of basic sanitation , overcrowding in cities , horrendously contaminated NN supplies , corporate takeover of farm land from DT NNS , DT highly destructive use of NNS and toxic JJ drugs and pesticides — PRP see a conscious and sustained effort to CONTROL DT weakened population — and PRP will find DT NN cover story publicized to DT sky as DT explanation for suffering , illness , and death .

Buoyed by an enormous 48 percent increase in Microsoft ’s share price this NN , Gates has retaken DT title he last held in 2017 . DT outcome is partially owed to DT whims of Donald J. NNP . Microsoft recently surprisingly defeated Amazon ’s bid for an extremely lucrative $ 10 billion Pentagon cloud computing contract WDT sees DT company instantly become CD of DT NN ’s most important military and security contractors . This decision , Amazon alleges , was due to interference from DT NN who holds a personal grudge against Bezos , whose Washington Post has maintained a campaign of “ resistance ” against him . Gates was RB recently in DT NN attacking DT wealth tax WDT Democratic presidential nomination candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proposed . “ I ’m all for super - progressive tax systems but when PRP say I should pay $ 100 billion , then I ’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over , ” DT Seattle native VBD . ( For DT record , he MD still have over $ 6 billion ) . In response , Warren was apologetic , asking for an opportunity to meet with Gates to explain how much he MD pay under DT plan . “ I promise PRP ’s not $ 100 billion , ” she VBD . But Sanders has been far more forthright in his opposition to DT super - wealthy , categorically stating , “ billionaires should not exist . ” Across DT NN , Gates is presented as CD of DT “ good billionaires ” : a warm - hearted philanthropist dedicated to giving away his entire fortune to needy causes . His charitable organization , DT Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , is DT largest of its sort in DT NN , holding over $ 50 billion in assets . His insight and generosity are constantly emphasized in headlines , as DT following examples demonstrate . “ How Bill Gates aims to Clean Up DT NNP , ” DT Guardian , ( 2/4/18 ) . “ What Einstein and Bill Gates Teach PRP About NNP Travel , ” NBC NNP , ( 5/10/17 ) . “ Bill Gates And Other Billionaires Pledge To Take On NN NN , ” NPR , ( 11/30/15 ) . “ Bill Gates on ending NN , saving lives : ‘ NN is on our side , ’ ” Al - Jazeera , ( 4/27/19 ) . “ Bill Gates gives $ 4.6 bn to charity in biggest donation since 2000 , ” DT Guardian , ( 8/15/17 ) . EX are a few problems with DT narrative . Firstly , if Gates is so committed to giving his money away , why does he keep getting richer ? This is not a trivial question : his net worth has increased from $ 75 billion in March 2016 to a staggering $ 106 billion today , according to Forbes Magazine , an over 40 percent increase in three NNS alone . Lee Camp , a political comedian who covers topics IN rampant inequality on his show , Redacted Tonight , told MintPress NNP : Linsey McGoey , Professor of Sociology at DT University of Essex , UK , and author of No Such Thing as a Free Gift : DT Gates Foundation and DT Price of Philanthropy , is profoundly skeptical of philanthropy as a whole , claiming PRP can actually sometimes harm democracy in DT long run : “ Philanthropy can and is being used deliberately to divert attention away from different forms of JJ exploitation WDT underpin JJ inequality today ” she told MintPress NNP , Thus , huge donations give Gates enormous power over DT education , NN and social policies of entire NNS . Where do Bill ’s billions VB ? As Foreign Affairs noted , “ few policy initiatives or normative standards set by DT NNP NNP Organization are announced before PRP have been casually , unofficially vetted by Gates Foundation staff . ” In this sense , his wealth is extraordinarily anti-democratic , giving him veto power over DT decisions and directions of organizations WDT should be collectively made by DT highest representatives of DT NN ’s population , not by CD very rich man . And Gates is far from omnipotent , holding JJ of DT patronizing assumptions about developing NNS and how best to organize DT NN WDT PRP MD expect a rich American tech geek to hold . McGoey spells out DT problem with this corporate attitude to development : CD example of DT Foundation enhancing corporate power is its close relationship with highly controversial pharmaceutical and chemical giant Monsanto Corporation , whom PRP helped gain a stronger foothold in Africa . PRP RB oversaw a flawed clinical trial of DT HPV NN in India in 2009 , where 23,000 impoverished girls aged 9 - 15 were exposed to potentially lethal drugs without even their parents ’ consent , leading to seven deaths . He is RB preoccupied with controlling Africa ’s population through family planning , fearing a population boom . As such , he appears almost more interested in eliminating DT NNS who are suffering than DT source of DT suffering itself . Gates is RB CD of DT most important individuals leading DT assault on DT American JJ education network in DT form of charter schools . Charter schools effectively privatize DT JJ school system , where DT NN continues to foot DT bill for DT school , but has no influence or say in how PRP is run . PRP have not been found to increase test scores , but are very popular with both DT private sector and DT religious right , whereas DT vast majority of unionized JJ school teachers oppose them . But , as DT Associated Press stated , EX is “ no bigger champion [ of charter schools ] than Bill Gates , ” who has plowed enormous amounts of money into DT movement , even funding DT pro-charter school documentary Waiting For Superman . If Gates represents a net negative force in NN politics , why does he receive such good press ? CD reason MD be his sizeable donations to a host of mainstream corporate NN outlets . For example , DT Gates Foundation underwrites DT entire NNP Development section of DT Guardian , and has given DT British newspaper over $ 9 million . Studying its donation database , PRP transpires PRP has RB contributed over $ 3 million to NBC Universal , over $ 4 million to DT influential French newspaper , Le Monde , over $ 4.5 million to NPR , $ 1 million to Al - Jazeera , and an astonishing $ 49 million to DT BBC ’s NN Action program , to name only a few . He who pays DT piper , PRP is VBN , calls DT tune . McGoey claims IN DT motive of billionaires giving to NN organizations is primarily “ to help legitimate DT spurious idea IN large corporate actors can rectify DT JJ harms and JJ inequality WDT their practices have often compounded . ” Gates himself is DT head of a gigantic NN empire . PRP already rely on Microsoft for social NN ( LinkedIn ) , entertainment ( Xbox ) , hardware and software IN DT Windows Phone and Windows OS . DT company RB owns stakes in NN giants IN Comcast and AT&T . And DT “ MS ” in “ MSNBC ” stands for “ Microsoft . ” PRP is a similar story for Jeff Bezos , who , in addition to Amazon ’s myriad NN ventures , owns DT Washington Post , which NN watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting has constantly shown often descends into little more than a propaganda outlet for its boss ’s interests . PRP appears IN once billionaires have purchased every worldly material good possible , DT only things left to buy are power and influence . While DT NN MD be full of stories singing Gates ’ praises , presenting him as a good billionaire ( as opposed to DT current NN ) , DT reality is IN CD man with DT amount of power , be PRP political ( IN NNP ) or JJ ( IN Gates and Bezos ) has a highly corrosive effect on democracy and society more generally . While PRP are portrayed as visionaries , multi-billionaires are often blinkered in other , very important ways . Just as reports about Amazon workers ’ poor pay and shocking working conditions were surfacing , Bezos declared IN DT only way he MD see to spend DT financial resources he accrued was to explore DT solar system and beyond . Sharing DT profit with his beleaguered workforce appears to genuinely not have occurred to him . If PRP are to move towards a better society , DT philanthropy of DT super - wealthy must be scrutinized , as all too often , what appears to be a generous gift is actually a calculated action intended to increase their power , image or influence . As former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee VBD , “ Charity is a cold grey loveless thing . If a rich man wants to help DT poor , he should pay his taxes gladly , not dole out money at a whim . ” Bill Gates is not just some rich guy who is unsure about paying more tax : he ’s a menace to society . *( Top image : William ( Bill ) H.

Jeff McDonald had gone out hunting for deer near his home in Manning , Oregon , when he saw Linus Norgren wearing what appeared to be ' tan clothing ' . But when he got closer , Mr McDonald , who was carrying a high - powered rifle , realized IN 22 - NN - old Norgren was in fact naked . He told Oregon Live how he asked him for his name and received a normal response before Norgren VBD IN he was ' a sasquatch from a family of sasquatches ' . After offering to help take him home , Norgren struck Mr McDonald on DT head with a rock , causing him to black out . When he woke up , Oregon Live reports , Norgren was on top of him and squeezing his hands tightly around his neck while Mr McDonald had suffered two dislocated shoulders . As DT struggle unfolded he asked his attacker why he was trying to kill him to which Norgren replied : ' Sasquatch kills DT hunter ' . Mr McDonald VBD he managed to bite CD of Mr Norgren 's knuckles before DT attacker appeared to ' pass out ' on top of him . After a further struggle he managed to free himself and reach his gun , according to reports . Pointing his rifle at Norgren , he called 911 . According to KPTV , McDonald told authorities PRP needed to VB RB quick , ' because I only have CD option here and PRP VBP what PRP is ' . Deputies eventually found them in thick forest after a 90 minute search . McDonald had held Norgren at gunpoint DT whole NN . In court this week , Norgren VBD he was suffering ' catastrophic mental disturbances ' at DT NN . Jurors were told IN he had experiences symptoms of his ' untreated bipolar disorder ' , Oregon Live reports , while Norgren RB told DT court IN he was acting in self - defense . ' I was injured already , I was naked and I was terrified , ' Norgren VBD in court Tuesday , KPTV reported . ' Not to make excuses for myself , but Mr. McDonald 's presence was absolutely terrifying . ' I truly believed I needed to defend myself to VB out of DT situation and VB home . ' I did n't VB to hurt him , I did n't VB to hurt Mr. McDonald . ' I did n't VB to kill him . I did n't VB anything to happen to either of PRP . ' But DT self defence argument was rejected by jurors and Norgren was convicted of attempted murder and three counts of second - degree assault . He was cleared of further charges of first degree assault and unlawful use of a weapon . Oregon Live reports IN his defense lawyer VBD he was unable to use an ' insanity defense ' without Norgren 's consent but suggested DT evidence of mental illness should be a ' mitigating factor ' . Norgren was jailed for ten NNS at Washington County Circuit Court this week , a NN and a half after DT incident in October 2013 ."

DT first of a raft of papers about ‘ Little Foot ’ suggests IN DT fossil is a female who showed some of DT earliest signs of human - JJ bipedal walking around 3.67 million NNS ago . She MD RB belong to a distinct species WDT most researchers have n’t previously recognized . “ PRP ’s almost a miracle PRP ’s come out intact , ” says Robin Crompton , a musculoskeletal biologist at DT University of Liverpool , UK , who has collaborated with DT research team WDT excavated DT skeleton . As well echoing DT mythical ‘ Bigfoot ’ , DT nickname Little Foot comes from DT small size of DT foot bones WDT were among DT first parts of DT skeleton to be discovered . DT first signs IN EX was an invaluable hominin specimen up for grabs came in 1994 . Ronald Clarke , a palaeoanthropologist at DT University of DT Witwatersrand ( Wits University ) in Johannesburg , South Africa , was rifling through boxes of fossils at a field laboratory at DT Sterkfontein caves , about 40 kilometres northwest of Johannesburg . He realized IN a handful of small bones in DT collection belonged to an early hominin . He established IN DT bones were those of a species of Australopithecus — ape - IN hominins WDT were present in Africa between about 4 million and 2 million NNS ago , before DT human genus Homo rose to dominance1 . Clarke and his colleagues then found JJ more bones embedded in a matrix of solid rock deep in DT Sterkfontein caves . PRP began carefully excavating Little Foot , piece by fragile piece , using hammers and chisels , followed by precision tools . DT entire process took them almost 20 NNS . “ DT fossilized bone is actually softer than DT matrix , ’ says Crompton . “ PRP ’s been an absolute devil to VB PRP out . ” By late last NN , Clarke ’s team had successfully removed enough bones to reconstruct more than 90 % of DT skeleton , and DT specimen was unveiled to DT NN . No other Australopithecus fossil comes close to DT level of completeness . For comparison , DT most famous Australopithecus — Lucy — is around 40 % complete . On 29 November , Clarke ’s team , posted two papers on Little Foot to DT bioRxiv preprint server — CD on DT age of DT specimen2 , DT other on DT limbs and locomotion3 . On 4 December , DT researchers posted a third , on DT skull and on DT potential relationship to a known hominin species4 . DT team posted a fourth paper5 , this NN focusing on DT arms and an injury Little Foot received during her life , on 5 December . Further papers , on DT hand , teeth and inner ear , are expected in DT near future , says Crompton . Most will ultimately appear in a special edition of DT Journal of Human Evolution . DT bioRxiv papers crystallize ideas WDT emerged in earlier publications about DT age of DT fossil . PRP RB cover some JJ ground , suggesting IN Little Foot was an adult female and stood about 130 centimetres tall — just 10 centimetres shorter than DT average woman in some modern - human populations . “ Little Foot was quite big , ” says Crompton . DT paper covering limbs and locomotion3 reveals IN Little Foot ’s legs are longer than her arms , similar to modern humans , making her DT oldest hominin for which PRP can be sure of DT feature , says Crompton . This means IN Little Foot was better adapted to walking upright on DT ground than JJ other australopiths , at least some of which seem to have spent more NN moving through trees . Little Foot ’s skull bones and teeth are so unusual IN Clarke and his colleagues have categorized her as a distinct species4 . PRP chose not to give this species a JJ name , but instead designate PRP as Australopithecus prometheus . A. prometheus was suggested in 1948 on DT basis of a skull fragment found roughly 250 kilometres north of Johannesburg6 , but quickly fell out of fashion when researchers decided PRP was simply an unusual representative of an already recognized species , called A. africanus . Clarke does n’t VB IN Little Foot belongs to A. africanus , and says DT simplest option is to resurrect DT name A. prometheus for Little Foot and a handful of similar fossils . DT preprint RB suggests IN A. prometheus is potentially an ancestor of a group of hominins called Paranthropus4 , which co-existed with early Homo species for about a million NNS . Lee Berger , an archaeologist RB at Wits University who was not involved in DT excavations , but is working on publications about Little Foot , disagrees with DT decision to resurrect A. prometheus . In a paper WDT is scheduled to be published on 10 December in DT American Journal of Physical Anthropology , Berger argues IN DT name A. prometheus was never properly defined . He has n’t yet decided whether Little Foot constitutes a distinct species — but if she does , Berger thinks a JJ name is needed . Berger adds he is disappointed by DT lack of solid information in DT papers on DT age and locomotion findings — he MD have liked to have seen detailed measurements of DT fossil bones , for instance . “ EX ’s no data — EX are almost no measurements of DT fossils , ” he says . Berger hopes to provide those data in his own publications — although he is still at an early stage of his analysis . Crompton responds IN DT locomotion paper is essentially an overview WDT attempts to reconstruct how Little Foot moved by drawing on DT solid data given in DT other papers . More - detailed data can be found in DT team ’s other papers , he says . Gabriele Macho , a biological anthropologist at DT University of Oxford , UK , agrees IN DT locomotion paper is light on solid data , but notes IN DT team acknowledges IN PRP is a work in progress . She looks forward to see more - detailed papers in DT future . “ DT positive thing is this skeleton is tremendously important , ” she says . “ No question about PRP . ”"

IN JJ true stories filtered through Hollywood ’s often overly sentimental lens , DT Sound of Music on - screen differs significantly from DT true tale of Maria , DT novice nun who takes a job as a governess in DT Austrian household of DT von Trapps , only to find herself falling in love with widower and retired naval captain Georg von Trapp and his seven NNS . DT film stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer as Maria and Georg , and features enduring songs such as “ Do - NNP - Mi , ” “ How Do PRP Solve a Problem IN Maria , ” “ Climb Ev’ry Mountain ” and “ Edelweiss . ” PRP received five Academy Awards ( including best picture ) and is DT third highest - grossing movie of all NN in DT U.S. after its box office is adjusted for inflation .

She attended teachers ' college where she discovered religion and converted to Catholicism before becoming a candidate for DT novitiate in Salzburg . Portrayed on film by Andrews as demure and self - effacing , DT real Maria was in fact a real problem while at DT convent , describing herself as “ horrid , DT worst PRP can imagine , ” in a 1980 article which includes a list of transgressions such as breaking NNP , speaking during periods of silence , running in DT courtyard , whistling Gregorian chants and climbing on DT convent roof . DT names of DT von Trapp NNS – and amount – were changed in DT movie In 1926 Maria was sent from DT convent to tutor only CD of Captain von Trapp ’s seven NNS from his first marriage .

Most readers by now have questioned DT name of Georg ’s daughter listed above . PRP ’s no surprise DT name is not familiar as CD of DT NNS ’s , in fact , all DT names and sexes of DT seven von Trapp NNS represented in DT movie were changed . DT real von Trapp NNS were ( in age descending order ) Rupert , Agathe , Maria , Werner , Hedwig , Johanna and Martina . On screen Rupert became Liesl , a 16 VBG on 17 - NN - old girl . In real life , by DT NN DT family fled Austria , Rupert was in his late twenties and a practicing physician . Even DT number of NNS was not correct in DT movie . When DT von Trapps escaped Austria EX were in fact nine NNS : seven from Georg ’s first marriage and two from his marriage to Maria , Rosmarie and Eleonore . DT tenth child , Johannes , was born in America in 1939 . DT real family was n't as wealthy as portrayed on screen Though money did not appear to be of concern to DT family depicted in DT movie , in real life DT fortunes of DT von Trapp family had faltered during DT JJ depression of DT early 1930s to DT extent IN at DT NN DT film is set , most of DT household servants had been dismissed and DT family had begun taking in boarders . DT lack of funds RB prompted DT family to consider turning their love of singing together into a profession . “ PRP almost hurt [ my father ] to have his family on stage , not from a snobbish view , but more from a protective NN , ” Eleonore is quoted as saying in a 1978 Washington Post interview . DT von Trapps were a musical household well before Maria entered their lives Both in real and reel life , DT family singers won first place in DT Salzburg Music Festival . But DT sound of music was already well established within DT household before Maria arrived . In a reversal of DT stern , music - forbidding retired naval officer depicted in DT film , DT real Georg and his first wife encouraged song in DT family home NNS before Maria arrived . “ In reality , Georg was a warm and loving if somewhat overwhelmed father , ” author Tom Santopietro writes in DT Sound of Music Story . “ PRP was actually Maria herself , with her emotionally stunted upbringing , who needed thawing . ” IN DT film , Maria and Georg were in fact married only a NN after DT novice arrived as governess . Unlike DT film , PRP were actually married in 1927 , more than a decade before fleeing Austria in 1938 . Georg was 25 NNS older than Maria and DT match was not love at first sight . Though Georg had fallen for Maria and asked her to stay with him and become a second mother to his NNS , Maria was not as sure of DT union , reportedly saying , “ God must have made him word PRP DT way because if he had only asked me to marry him I might not have VBN yes . ” DT real von Trapps did not secretly cross DT alps by foot DT family ’s exit from Austria under Nazi occupation was RB given a glossy Hollywood treatment , depicting DT von Trapps as having to cross DT alps on foot to avoid detection . In reality such a journey MD have brought them to directly into Germany , not Switzerland as in DT film . “ Do n’t PRP VB geography in Hollywood ? Salzburg does not border on Switzerland ! ” complained Maria to a reporter in 1967 . Though PRP left Austria only a day before DT borders were sealed , their actual departure lacked DT drama contained in DT film according to documents and interviews contained in DT U.S. National Archives . “ PRP did tell NNS IN PRP were VBG to America to sing , ” daughter Maria told Opera NNP in 2003 . “ And PRP did not climb over mountains with all our heavy suitcases and instruments . PRP left by train in broad daylight , pretending nothing . ” DT von Trapps traveled with their musical conductor , Rev. Franz Wasner , and secretary Martha Zochbauer . On film Wasner became DT fictional Max Detweiler , who remained in Austria . DT real journey took DT family first to Italy , where Georg attained citizenship due to his birthplace having become Italian territory in 1920 , then on to London before boarding a ship for America . During DT early 1940s PRP toured DT U.S. as DT Trapp Family Singers , eventually settling in Stowe , Vermont . RB PRP opened a guest house , which is still owned and operated by descendants of DT von Trapp family ."

Avoid_VB wearing_VBG uncomfortable_JJ shoes_NNS ._.","In most NNS , your doctor can diagnose a plantar wart with CD or more of these techniques : • Paring DT lesion with a scalpel and checking for signs of dark , pinpoint dots — tiny clotted blood vessels • Removing a small section of DT lesion ( shave biopsy ) and sending PRP to a laboratory for analysis Most plantar warts are harmless and VBP away without treatment , though PRP MD take a NN or two . If your warts are painful or spreading , PRP MD VB to try treating them with over - DT - counter ( nonprescription ) medications or home remedies . PRP MD need JJ repeated treatments before DT warts VBP away , and PRP MD return later . If your self - care approaches have n't helped , talk with your doctor about these treatments : • None Stronger peeling medicine ( salicylic acid ) . Prescription - strength wart medications with salicylic acid work by removing layers of a wart a little bit at a NN . PRP MD RB stimulate your immune system 's ability to fight DT wart . Your doctor will likely suggest PRP apply DT medicine regularly at home , followed by occasional office visits . • None Freezing medicine ( cryotherapy ) . Cryotherapy done at a doctor 's office involves applying liquid nitrogen to DT wart , either with a spray or a cotton swab . This method can be painful , so your doctor MD numb DT area first . DT chemical causes a blister to form around your wart , and DT dead tissue sloughs off within a week or so . Cryotherapy MD RB stimulate your immune system to fight viral warts . PRP MD need to return to DT doctor 's office for repeat treatments every two to four weeks until DT wart disappears . Some studies suggest IN cryotherapy combined with salicylic acid treatment is more effective than just cryotherapy , but further NN is needed . If salicylic acid and freezing medicine do n't work , your doctor MD recommend CD or more of DT following treatments : • Other acids . Your doctor shaves DT surface of DT wart and applies trichloroacetic acid with a wooden toothpick . PRP 'll need to return to DT doctor 's office for repeat treatments every week or so . Side effects include burning and stinging . Between visits , PRP MD be asked to apply salicylic acid to DT wart . • Immune therapy . This method uses medications or solutions to stimulate your immune system to fight viral warts . Your doctor MD inject your warts with a foreign substance ( antigen ) or apply a solution or cream to DT warts . • Minor surgery . Your doctor cuts away DT wart or destroys PRP by using an electric needle ( electrodesiccation and curettage ) . This procedure can be painful , so your doctor will numb your skin first . Because surgery has a risk of scarring , this method usually is n't used to treat plantar warts unless other treatments have failed . • Laser treatment . Pulsed - dye laser treatment burns closed ( cauterizes ) tiny blood vessels . DT infected tissue eventually dies , and DT wart falls off . This method requires repeat treatments every three to four weeks . DT evidence for DT effectiveness of this method is limited , and PRP can cause pain and potentially scarring . • NN . HPV NN has been used with success to treat warts even though this NN is not specifically targeted toward DT wart NN WDT causes DT majority of plantar warts . JJ NNS have removed warts with these self - care tips : • Peeling medicine ( salicylic acid ) . Nonprescription wart removal products are available as a patch or liquid . Usually , PRP 're instructed to wash DT site , soak PRP in warm NN , and gently remove DT top layer of softened skin with a pumice stone or emery board . Then after DT skin has dried , PRP apply DT solution or patch . Patches are usually changed every 24 to 48 hours . Liquid applications are generally used daily . PRP MD need repeated applications on a regular basis over several weeks to months to see results . • Freezing medicine ( cryotherapy ) . Nonprescription medicines WDT freeze DT wart include Compound W Freeze Off and Dr. Scholl 's Freeze Away . DT Food and Drug Administration cautions IN some wart removers are flammable and should n't be used around fire , flame , heat sources ( such as curling irons ) and lit cigarettes . • Duct tape . Using duct tape to remove warts is a harmless but unproven approach . To try PRP , cover DT wart with silver duct tape , changing PRP every few days . Between applications , soak DT wart and gently remove dead tissue with a pumice stone or emery board . Then leave DT wart open to DT air to dry for a few hours before covering PRP with tape again . PRP 'll likely start by seeing your primary care doctor . He or she MD refer PRP to a specialist in disorders of DT skin ( dermatologist ) or feet ( podiatrist ) . DT following tips can help PRP prepare for your appointment . What PRP can do Bring a list of all medications PRP take regularly — including over - DT - counter ( nonprescription ) medications and dietary supplements — and DT daily dosage of each . PRP MD RB VB to list questions for your doctor , such as : • If I have a plantar wart , can I start with at - home care ? • If I proceed with home treatment , under what conditions should I call PRP ? • If DT first treatment does n't work , what will PRP try next ? • If DT lesion is n't a plantar wart , what tests do PRP need to do ? • How long will PRP take to VB results ? What to expect from your doctor Your doctor MD ask PRP questions such as : • When did DT lesion first appear ? • Has PRP changed in size or appearance ? • Have PRP had warts before ? • Do PRP have diabetes or poor sensation in your feet ? • Do PRP have any condition or take any medication WDT has weakened your ability to fight NN ( immune response ) ? • Have PRP tried any home remedies ? If so , how long have PRP used them and have PRP helped ? • Do PRP use a swimming pool or locker room — places WDT can harbor wart - causing viruses ? What PRP can do in DT meantime If PRP 're sure PRP have a plantar wart , PRP MD try over - DT - counter remedies or alternative medicine approaches . But talk with your doctor before trying self - care treatments if PRP have : If pressure on DT wart causes pain , try wearing well - cushioned shoes , such as athletic shoes WDT evenly support DT sole and relieve some of DT pressure . Avoid wearing uncomfortable shoes ."

DT liger has parents in DT same genus but of different species . DT liger is distinct from DT similar hybrid called DT tigon , and is DT largest of all known extant felines . [ 1] [ 2 ] PRP enjoy swimming , which is a characteristic of tigers , and are very sociable IN lions . Notably , ligers typically grow larger than either parent species , unlike tigons . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] DT history of lion - tiger hybrids dates to at least DT early 19th century in India . In 1798 , Étienne Geoffroy Saint - Hilaire ( 1772 –1844 ) made a colour plate of DT offspring of a lion and a tiger . DT portmanteau "" liger "" was coined by DT 1930s . [ 4 ] In 1825 , G. B. Whittaker made an engraving of liger cubs born in 1824 . [3 ] DT parents and their three liger offspring are RB depicted with their trainer in a 19th - century painting in DT naïve style . Two liger cubs born in 1837 were exhibited to King William IV and to his successor Queen Victoria . On 14 December 1900 and on 31 NNP 1901 , Carl Hagenbeck wrote to zoologist James Cossar Ewart with details and photographs of ligers born at DT Hagenbeck 's Tierpark in Hamburg in 1897 . In Animal Life and DT NNP of Nature ( 1902 –1903 ) , A. H. Bryden described Hagenbeck 's "" lion - tiger "" hybrids : PRP has remained for CD of DT most enterprising collectors and naturalists of our NN , Mr. Carl Hagenbeck , not only to breed but to bring successfully to a healthy maturity , specimens of this rare alliance between those two great and formidable Felidae , DT lion and tiger . DT illustrations will indicate sufficiently how fortunate Mr. Hagenbeck has been in his efforts to produce these hybrids . DT oldest and biggest of DT animals shown is a hybrid born on DT 11th NNP 1897 . This fine beast , now more than five NNS old , equals and even excels in his proportions a well - grown lion , measuring as he does from nose tip to tail 10 ft 2 inches in length , and standing only three inches less than 4 ft at DT shoulder . A good big lion will weigh about 400 lb [...] DT hybrid in question , weighing as PRP does no less than 467 lb , is certainly DT superior of DT most well - grown lions , whether wild - bred or born in a menagerie . This animal shows faint striping and mottling , and , in its characteristics , exhibits strong traces of both its parents . PRP has a somewhat lion - JJ head , and DT tail is more IN DT of a lion than of a tiger . On DT other hand , PRP has no trace of mane . PRP is a huge and very powerful beast . [ 5 ] In 1935 , four ligers from two litters were reared in DT Zoological Gardens of Bloemfontein , South Africa . Three of them , a male and two females , were still living in 1953 . DT male weighed 340 kg ( 750 lb ) and stood a foot and a half ( 45 cm ) taller than a full grown male lion at DT shoulder . Although ligers are more commonly found than tigons today , in At Home in DT Zoo ( 1961 ) , Gerald Iles wrote "" For DT record I must say IN I have never seen a liger , a hybrid obtained by crossing a lion with a tigress . PRP seem to be even rarer than tigons . "" [ 6 ] DT liger is often believed to represent DT largest known cat in DT NN . [ 1 ] Males reach a total length of 3 to 3.6 m ( 9.8 to 11.8 ft ) , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] which means IN PRP rival even large male lions and tigers in length . [ 9 ] Imprinted genes MD be a factor contributing to DT large size of ligers . [ 10 ] These are genes WDT MD or MD not be expressed on DT parent PRP are inherited from , and WDT occasionally play a role in issues of hybrid growth . For example , in some dog breed crosses , genes WDT are expressed only when maternally - inherited cause DT young to grow larger than is typical for either parent breed . This growth is not seen in DT paternal breeds , as such genes are normally "" counteracted "" by genes inherited from DT female of DT appropriate breed . [ 11 ] Other big cat hybrids can reach similar sizes ; DT litigon , a rare hybrid of a male lion and a female tigon , is roughly DT same size as DT liger , with a male named Cubanacan ( at DT Alipore Zoo in India ) reaching 363 kg ( 800 lb ) . [ 12 ] DT extreme rarity of these second - generation hybrids MD make PRP difficult to ascertain whether PRP are larger or smaller , on average , than DT liger . PRP is wrongly believed IN ligers continue to grow throughout their lives due to hormonal issues . [ 13 ] PRP MD be IN PRP simply grow far more during their growing NNS and take longer to reach their full adult size . Further growth in shoulder height and body length is not seen in ligers over six NNS old , as in both lions and tigers . Male ligers RB have DT same levels of testosterone on average as an adult male lion , yet are azoospermic in accordance with Haldane 's rule . In addition , female ligers MD RB attain great size , weighing approximately 320 kg ( 705 lb ) and reaching 3.05 m ( 10 ft ) long on average , and are often fertile . In contrast , pumapards ( hybrids between pumas and leopards ) tend to exhibit dwarfism . Ligers are about DT same size as DT prehistoric Smilodon populator and American lion . Hercules , DT largest non-obese liger , is recognised by DT Guinness Book of NNP Records as DT largest living cat on NNP , weighing 418.2 kg ( 922 lb ) . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Hercules was featured on DT Today Show , Good Morning America , Anderson Cooper 360 , Inside Edition , and in a Maxim article in 2005 , when he was only three NNS old and already weighed 408.25 kg ( 900 lb ) . DT Valley of DT Kings Animal Sanctuary in Wisconsin had a male liger named Nook who weighed over 550 kg ( 1,213 lb ) . [ 2 ] [ 16 ] To compare , DT records for DT lion and tiger in captivity are under 1,100 pounds ( 500 kg ) . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Shasta , a ligress ( female liger ) was born at DT Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City on 14 NNP 1948 and died in 1972 at age 24 . [ CD ] Nook died in 2007 , at 21 NNS old . [ 2 ] [ 16 ] Hobbs , a male liger at DT Sierra Safari Zoo in Reno , Nevada , lived to almost 15 NNS of age before succumbing to liver failure and weighed 450 kg ( 992 lb ) . [ 20 ] This liger was born in 1943 and died in 1960 . South Africa has two ligers at its zoo at Bloemfontein . [ 21 ] DT fertility of hybrid big cat females is well documented across a number of different hybrids . This is in accordance with Haldane 's rule : in hybrids of animals whose sex is determined by sex chromosomes , if CD sex is absent , rare or sterile , PRP is DT heterogametic sex ( DT NN with two different sex chromosomes e.g. X and Y ) .[ clarification needed ] According to Wild Cats of DT NNP ( 1975 ) by C. A. W. Guggisberg , ligers and tigons were long thought to be sterile ; however , in 1943 , a fifteen - NN - old hybrid between a lion and an ' Island ' tiger was successfully mated with a lion at DT Munich Hellabrunn Zoo . DT female cub , though of delicate NN , was raised to adulthood . [ 22 ] In September 2012 , DT Russian Novosibirsk Zoo announced DT birth of a "" liliger "" , which is DT offspring of a liger mother and a lion father . DT cub was named Kiara . [ 23 ] Ligers have a tiger - JJ striped pattern WDT is very faint upon a lionesque tawny background . In addition , PRP MD inherit rosettes from DT lion parent ( lion cubs are rosetted and some adults retain faint markings ) . These markings MD be black , dark brown or sandy . DT background color MD be correspondingly tawny , sandy or golden . In common with tigers , their underparts are pale . DT actual pattern and color depend on which subspecies DT parents were and on how DT genes interact in DT offspring . White tigers have been crossed with lions to produce "" white "" ( actually pale golden ) ligers . In theory , white tigers MD be crossed with white lions to produce white , very pale or even stripeless ligers . EX are no black ligers . Very few melanistic tigers have ever been recorded , most being due to excessive markings ( pseudo - melanism or abundism ) rather than true melanism ; no reports of black lions have ever been substantiated . As blue or Maltese tigers probably no longer exist , gray or blue ligers are exceedingly improbable . PRP is not impossible for a liger to be white , but PRP is very rare . Keeping DT two species separate has been standard procedure .[ citation needed ] However , ligers have occurred , and do occur , by accident in captivity .

A deeper look at DT symbolism in these videos reveals DT disturbing story of a young girl ’s abuse inside DT elite ’s system of mind control . While she only obtained mainstream success in 2014 , Sia has been hard at work in DT music industry for NNS . In addition to her own six studio albums , Sia has written hit songs for DT NN ’s biggest pop stars including Beyonce , Rihanna , Britney Spears and Rita Ora . If PRP ’re a reader of Vigilant Citizen , PRP already VBP IN ALL of these artists have been mentioned on this site because PRP have all been used to push DT elite ’s Agenda at some point or another in their careers . Sia is , therefore , not a stranger to DT higher ups of DT music industry and DT messages PRP wants to perpetuate . DT imagery associated with Sia ’s sixth album 1000 Forms of Fear is right in line with DT elite ’s ongoing Agenda , which includes DT sexualization of NNS , DT normalization of ritual abuse , and DT promotion of mind control . While these are strong words to describe videos of a young girl dancing while wearing a wig , DT plethora of symbols surrounding DT video trilogy strongly points in DT direction . DT album cover features DT blond wig worn by Sia and Maddie Ziegler . This blond wig represents DT concept of alter persona . DT creation of alter personas is DT main goal of Monarch mind control ( if PRP do n’t VB what I am referring to , read this article first ) and , coincidentally , products of Beta Kitten programming are often made to wear blond wigs . In DT videos , this wig is worn by Maddie Ziegler , who is a typical child star raised by a twisted industry . Maddie Ziegler began dancing at DT age of 2 and , at age 8 , appeared on Dance Moms , a “ reality TV ” show WDT I will never watch because PRP MD probably cause me severe nausea and intense chest pain . I have come across a few screenshots from DT show and … PRP gave me severe nausea and intense chest pain . DT show is CD is yet another excuse to dress young girls in slutty outfits and putting them on TV . Ziegler has RB appeared in a few Disney TV shows ( DT ultimate launch pad of screw up child stars ) . Today , at age 12 , things are getting out of hand . Maddie Ziegler is yet another example of a child star who grew up in an industry ruled by sick NNS who prey on DT innocence of NNS . Sia ’s videos symbolically describe DT dark side of this entire system . Let ’s look at DT videos . If PRP listens to Chandelier without watching DT video , PRP appears to be about a girl who parties and gets drunk in order to keep sadness and desperation at bay . Some parts of DT lyrics indicate IN DT “ NN for a good NN call ” might actually be in DT “ pleasure for men ” industry . She “ parties ” ( works ) all night , but she actually feels miserable . She gets wasted to become blind to DT truth and numb from DT pain . However , at DT end of DT night , DT sun sheds light on DT harshness of her reality . While DT song might have heavy implications WDT can be interpreted in several ways , DT video adds an even more disturbing dimension by featuring a 12 - NN - old girl in a skin - colored spandex suit dancing ecstatically to PRP . DT video plunges DT song into DT dark NN of mind control , where abandoned NNS deal with trauma , abuse , and multiple personalities . DT video features Maddie Ziegler dancing inside a grimy and abandoned apartment with strange drawings ( apparently drawn by her ) hanging on DT wall . DT video ends with a shot of Maddie standing in DT doorway while DT image blurs , making PRP appear as if she is wearing nothing ( I wo n’t even post a screenshot of this ) . This probably pleased child lovers watching DT video . Elastic Heart goes even further . Featuring a near - naked Shia Labeouf wrestling with Maddie Ziegler inside a cage , DT Elastic Heart video sparked some mass NN controversy due to its pedophile undertones . This even prompted Sia to apologize on Twitter . PRP is interesting IN Sia “ anticipated ” DT “ cries ” , but went with PRP anyway . This is not DT kind of subject to take lightly , especially considering DT fact IN countless NNS have been traumatized by PRP . PRP is RB interesting IN Sia felt IN Shia Labeouf was DT only dancer who plays DT role in her video . As I stated my article What is Happening to Shia Labeouf , Shia has been involved , in several ways , in DT disturbing NN of MK , including growing up as Disney child star . Recently , he was DT star of DT video Fjögur Píanó , which was clearly about Monarch programming ( see my article about PRP here ) and over DT past NNS , he has displayed DT kind of erratic behavior WDT is typical of MK slaves . In an interview with Interview Magazine , Shia described DT difficult relationship with his father by using terms WDT can RB be applied to mind control handlers . So , yes , I suppose Shia is DT right person to play a role in a trilogy WDT revolves around mind control . Is Shia playing DT role of his own manipulative father in DT video ? Is he a predatory abuser ? Do DT dancers represent warring NNS in Sia ’s head ? Maybe all of DT above . Maddie reacts to DT “ advances ” ( for lack of a better word ) by acting IN an animal , biting Shia ’s hand and roaring at him , as if she knew what was coming . However , Maddie warms up to Shia and gets close to him . Sometimes NNS do n’t VB DT boundary between love and abuse . This video featuring two lost souls in a strange setting with disturbing undertones ends sadly . While PRP is difficult to exactly pinpoint what went on in Elastic Heart , DT Big Girls Cry video is obvious … for those “ in DT NN ” . While DT song is about “ big girls ” being heartbroken , DT video features a little girl for three and a half minutes . During DT NN , DT girl played again by Maggie Ziegler , performs all kinds of facial expressions WDT end up telling a story . And , she does indeed mimic DT abuse and trauma suffered by an MK slave . When PRP understands what this is truly about , DT video is actually quite clear , even blatant . DT video ends with DT final product of DT traumatizing and dehumanizing process of mind control . Sia ’s video trilogy tells a story WDT is dark and disturbing . PRP will , however , remain a mystery to most viewers because most of them say “ Wow , DT ’s so creative and artistic ” without truly understanding what PRP is about . DT videos all star Maddie Ziegler , a child performer WDT is sadly becoming another face of DT mass NN ’s obsession with child exploitation . Each video in DT trilogy describes a different aspect of mind control , creating a disturbing narrative .

Trolls are employees WDT answered a work at home job ad on craigslist or some other venue . DT geoengineering trolls , specifically , are employed by DT two main disinformation sites , metaxxxx and contrailxxxxxxx , both run by a gaming programmer . He and his band of hired internet trolls lack expertise in NN , meteorology or any other field related to geoengineering , yet claim to be experts in atmospheric NN , and fancy themselves “ debunkers ” . Shillidiocy is a term WDT best describes DT rapidly growing industry of NNS ready and willing to sell out humanity for a few pennies per comment . Disinformation has been used throughout history for political purposes and these strategies are being utilized today by these paid internet trolls . ( Psychological Warfare – discredit , distract , intimidate , frustrate , divide & conquer ) – Disinformation shills often make outrageous comments for DT sole purpose of deflecting focus from DT truth to distract PRP by creating a “ controversial debate ” where none truly exists . Often , trolls use DT “ Trojan Horse ” method to attempt to elicit an emotional response from NNS online , to evoke hostility with DT intent of twisting PRP around to make DT person look volatile , a classic “ character assassination ” tactic to discredit them , making them appear weak . On some occasions , PRP intentionally keep pushing a person into a heated argument , and will VB so far as to “ report ” DT person as being a “ threat ” to try to VB them kicked off of DT forum . Another major character assassination tactic is to highlight any negative or perceived flaw of an otherwise reputable person , whether true or false , to intentionally discredit them in an attempt to invalidate their viewpoint and make them seem baseless , to detract focus from DT information PRP are sharing . DT trolls often “ make stuff up ” if PRP ca n’t find anything real to highlight for this goal , after all , shills are paid liars . Another trick these liars are taught is to use semantics to twist NNS ’s words around and make PRP seem as though PRP ’ve lied , to discredit them . These are all character assassination tactics WDT PRP will easily recognize happening all over DT internet once PRP become familiar with them . Disinformation shills sometimes pose as a supporter of DT truth , or “ friendly folks on DT fence ” politely asking simple questions , in a sly attempt to later discredit DT movement . Often trolls posing as friendly allies will resort to posting long , incoherent diatribes ( usually on fake blogs & articles ) for DT purpose of associating DT movement with insanity ; or other times to act as a “ DT voice of reason ” and create a debate ( where none exists ) to make PRP appear as though DT data is n’t strong enough , and PRP offer to play “ devil ’s advocate ” to “ help DT movement ” , then render any and all data as invalid regardless of how legitimate DT source . PRP will “ demand proof ” then ignore PRP when PRP ’s presented , or continue to demand impossible proofs . Regardless of what material MD be presented by an opponent in JJ forums , PRP will deem DT material irrelevant and demand unattainable proof DT is virtually impossible for DT opponent to retrieve ; for DT purpose of detracting focus from DT mounds of legitimate data available for those of PRP WDT take DT NN to do some real research beyond DT disinformation site links . Trolls often interject themselves into productive web discussions in order to make themselves appear credible as though PRP have a “ real ” argument , where none actually exists . Their job is to create controversy and instigate a “ debate ” . PRP scour DT net and attack awareness videos , articles , blogs , JJ facebook pages , etc. , posting links from metaxxxx or conxxxxxscience , but fail to post legitimate links with verifiable references . PRP relentlessly keep commenting on a thread to dominate DT discussion with DT intent to keep their comments at DT very top . PRP RB vote their comments up and everyone else ’s comments down , ( if DT forum offers DT feature ) . This is evident when PRP become familiar with their methods . I have yet to see a disinformation shill post a reputable link , or ANY link , other than from those two disinformation sites . In addition , PRP adamantly refuse to look at real data . PRP intentionally divert attention from credible documentation , dismissing PRP without examination . PRP regurgitate DT same tired harassing insults , and repetitive generic jargon about how NN vapor condensation trails are formed , which has nothing to do with DT persistent , spreading , lingering trails PRP often see covering DT sky WDT is being done as “ scientific research ” , DT prelude to fully implementing JJ geoengineering programs . Trolls are supplied with a list or database with preplanned talking points and a format designed as generalized and deceptive responses to honest arguments . Geoengineering ( chemtrails ) “ debunker ” trolls are notorious for this , and note PRP never actually “ debunk ” anything . All PRP do is deflect from DT truth to try to cast doubt and keep DT denial tactic VBG so DT profiteers of geoengineering can continue to suppress JJ outcry in order to keep spraying PRP without PRP balking and rising up to stop them . If PRP pay close attention and track DT trolls , PRP will see IN PRP often post DT same comments over and over on JJ different threads . This works hand in hand with # 1 ( character assassination ) , and DT “ Trojan Horse ” troll . DT goal is to sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule , engaging them in a hostile argument to try to discredit them , RB known as DT “ attack DT messenger ” ploy . DT goal of “ false association ” is to associate opponents with unpopular titles such as “ paranoid NN theorist ” to make them look crazy and try to discredit them , or call them derogatory names such as “ chemtard ” , “ ignorant ” , or “ liar ” , attempting to invalidate anything PRP say regardless of how true PRP is . DT trolls seek to deliberately associate DT movement with far fetched concepts IN “ Big Foot ” , aliens , false flag NN theories , etc. , because of DT inherent negative connotations , ( tying in with “ character assassination ” ) . DT ultimate goal is to provoke argument , create biases , and dissuade NNS from objectively examining any evidence presented . Pretending to be DT “ voice of reason ” in an argument with obvious and defined sides in an attempt to move NNS away from what is clearly true , into DT murky waters of “ doubt ” where DT truth becomes “ relative . ” And if DT does n’t work PRP will antagonize and goad opponents with insults , name calling , and bullying . If PRP ca n’t do anything else , PRP will chide and taunt their opponents and draw them into emotional responses with DT goal of making them look foolish or mentally unbalanced , in hopes of rendering their point invalid merely by shifting focus to show how “ sensitive PRP are to criticism ” , in an attempt to deflect from their point and invalidate any data PRP are presenting . This is why PRP ’s best to ignore their taunting . A very common technique is IN DT troll will accuse his opposition of subscribing to a certain point of view , even if he does not , will make PRP appear so , then attack DT point of view ( Straw Man ) . Or , DT troll will put words in DT mouth of his opposition , and then rebut those specific words . He will use conjecture , ridicule , and accusation to try and prove himself as valid while discrediting others with absolutely nothing , shouting “ PRP have no argument , DT is just ad hominem ” , which is ironically , exactly what he is doing . DT troll is trained to appear confident , unwavering , and IN he is undoubtedly right , when in reality , PRP ’s DT exact opposite . Basically , he is a paid liar and his goal is to create doubt and discredit DT truth . When DT internet shill realizes NNS are aware of his tactics , he will try to play nice , act innocent , and pose a seemingly “ harmless ” leading question . William01702 , used tactic #s 6 , 8 , and 2 to troll DT video ( link below ) of DT courageous Kristen Meghan , who stands strong to do what is right in DT face of adversity to warn NNS about geoengineering and DT disinformation sites . If PRP watch DT video and listen to her , PRP is clear what is happening with DT rampant disinformation in our mainstream ; PAID shills are ready and willing to contribute to DT demise of our NN , and sell out their humanity to perpetuate lies for a measly buck . DT shill “ Hama Neggs ” RB trolled PRP with some derogatory comments about Kristen Meghan using # 1 ( character assassination ) . These troll ’s comments MD , or MD not , VB deleted by DT page moderator ; but if PRP remain , notice DT date and how quickly PRP found PRP . PRP ’s their job to scour DT net and attack , so in NN , even if theirs VBP deleted , more paid trolls will appear . If PRP check other awareness videos , PRP ’ll see DT same usernames in action repetitively . Save LI Forum – 09 – Kristen Meghan – Geo-engineering DT following bold , italic quotes are actual troll comments made by username William01702 who is known to routinely attack youtube geoengineering awareness videos . “ MD PRP please tell me what “ disinformation ” PRP have found on Metabunk or contrailscience ? I mean , PRP claim DT information is n’t factual , and then provide no evidence to support such a claim . Why ? ” … “ PRP really is a legitimate question which deserves an answer . Despite what paranoid liars IN GalileoGalileisGhost say . ” ( If William01702 was just a random viewer , why MD he care whether those sites have been exposed as disinformation , and “ demand proof ” , unless he IS an associate ( a paid shill ) ? DT answer becomes evident if PRP notice how he followed with DT classic “ false association ” & “ Trojan Horse ” tactic to disparage shill buster , GalileoGalileisGhost . MD a random user WDT ’s not associated with those disinformation sites have cause to do this ) ? William01702 – on a different thread : ( note DT contrast when confronted for his shill activity ) : “ I ’m not a troll I ’m just someone who is better educated in atmospheric NN and aviation than all chemtards , combined . ” ( notice his derogatory use of DT word “ CHEMTARDS ” a classic Trojan Horse move ) . William01702 : “ Chemtards MD n’t be more stupid if PRP wanted to be . PRP NNS are evil alarmists who spread fear , hate , and ignorance based on a lack of education . I pity DT chemtards ! ” ( does DT sound IN someone educated in atmospheric sciences or anything else for DT matter ) ? William01702 wrote this on an entirely different thread : “ Oh really and where do PRP say IN THIS trail has ANYTHING to do with what PRP have “ admitted to ” . NO WHERE ! PRP ’s hilarious IN PRP NNS read about some basic testing and then assume everything PRP see in DT sky must be related to such testing . Chemtards are idiots ! Oh , and BTW show me where anyone has admitted to any such thing ! If PRP say HR2977 PRP ’re a fucking moron ! ” William01702 wrote this on yet another thread ( verbatim , spelling errors & all ) : “ Tat should have read “ because PRP are too stupid and lazy to understand basic fucking NN ” . But , does PRP matter ?! Will PRP VB anything ?! No , PRP will always assume IN just because PRP hate / fear DT NN WDT PRP must mean IN PRP and your chemtard friends must be right about DT trails in DT sky . Nevermind DT fact IN PRP have never actually studed these subjects ! PRP have visited NN sites ! PRP VBP PRP all real pilots are just STUPID for VBG to school for NNS ! ” William01702 on yet another thread : “ Poor chemtards unable to understand he difference between an intentional nefarious release of chemicals and business as usual ” . William01702 and yet another thread : “ Why do PRP NNS pretend to understand IN minor differences in temperature , engine power settings , engine types , and engine size can result in differences in trails , when its obvious IN PRP are all fucking clueless !!! This video is n’t evidence of anything more than DT ignorance of chemtards ” ! William01702 on a video about chemical fallout from geoengineering ( notice DT pattern from DT previous comments ) : “ Yup , I ’m sure IN she is a moron . And so are PRP . EX is ZERO evidence IN this “ affliction ” has ANYTHING to do with DT trails in DT sky . NONE ! PRP ’s nothing more than paranoid fantasy made up by those who VBP to pick at their skin . And PRP are right , she IS just CD moron in a line of JJ . By DT way accepting ignorant bullshit from OTHER paranoid losers on DT internet is NOT “ research ” . ” William01702 wrote these comments on various videos as well : “ Stupid chemtards ” , “ Idiot ” , “ Moron ” , AND “ DT is technology WDT is not only JJ knowledge , but is highly regulated . PRP RB has nothing to do with any trails in DT sky . DT ’s DT problem with PRP NNS . PRP are completely ignorant but are too stupid to VB PRP ” ! Compare DT subsequent comments with DT name calling & insults , to DT first NN WDT was on a video where his disinformation sites were brought to light and notice how he tried to recover by looking innocent & friendly despite his hostility and antagonistic comments on other awareness videos . Who are these trolls WDT have NN to sit around and make comments on youtube all day and night , and WHY target awareness videos ? DT answer is clear , PRP are SHILLS . I took photos of DT comment pages in DT likely event WDT this loathsome user attempts to attack this blog and denies ever making those comments . So , unless he deletes all of his comments from all DT youtube awareness videos he has attacked , and closes his account , ( let ’s hope he does ) , PRP can plainly see his existing comments ( and more ) on youtube by checking his page activity or tracking him on awareness videos . Just remember not to let DT trolls bait PRP . PRP VBP PAID to antagonize PRP and LURE PRP to those disinformation sites . PRP is apparent IN some of these shills share usernames and have round DT clock shifts because no NN is online WDT often to target DT JJ awareness videos without backup . William01702 is joined by known shills such as Hama Neggs ( a particularly loathsome troll ) , Lizoir , Terry Ram , Nwoflyer , epsilon892 , Niglet Gook , Belfrey1 , Jazzaconda , Baba Loo , MrFubar75 , and several other usernames WDT have been identified as paid shills / trolls , all utilizing DT same tactics and associated with DT two known disinformation sites , employed by gaming programmer , DT grand daddy of them all , Mick We$t , ( or at least DT ’s DT name he “ goes by ” ) . Their format is always DT same and PRP often attack in teams to “ back each other up ” . Anyone WDT does a little digging will find these same usernames frequently darkening awareness videos all over youtube , regurgitating insults , performing their usual antagonistic , tactical routine , and attempting to lure NNS over to their disinformation sites because PRP VBP compensated for PRP . Less frequently , PRP ’ll see these strategies mimicked by average NNS in DT mainstream WDT have willfully succumbed to cognitive dissonance and easily fallen prey to DT disinformation tactics WDT have been used on them . PRP seem happy to regurgitate DT lies PRP have been told and are content to post links only from those disinformation sites , while refusing to look at any other credible data presented to them . PRP ’s IN a mass Stockholm Syndrome in which their limited intellects are easily held hostage by their disinformation captors , and PRP ’ve fallen “ in love ” with Mick We$t and his band of marauding minions . These victims of mass brainwashing RB exhibit DT common trait among trolls , of refusing to examine credible , verifiable , REAL data ( such as several scholarly documents WDT can be found through this link : http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=geoengineering+modeling+studies&hl=en&as Sadly , NNS ’s refusal to examine any data beyond DT disinformation sites , means success for DT disinformation campaign . Getting DT NN to do their bidding , not only meets DT goal of “ divide and conquer ” in DT battle to pit PRP against each other , PRP keeps PRP distracted , engaged in their fictitious debate , and prevents PRP from focusing on DT fact IN heavy metals such as aluminum , barium , and strontium , and other toxic chemicals such as sulphuric acid , and silver iodide , are being sprayed into our air supply globally for DT purpose of Weather Modification and NN Engineering . In this war on awareness , DT truth becomes irrelevant , and DT sleepwalkers , happy to remain blissfully ignorant , are proud to belong to DT band of trolls WDT have , ironically , convinced them IN PRP are DT “ ignorant ” ones , and IN PRP are DT geniuses WDT have all DT answers . DT telltale difference between mass cognitive dissonance and a paid internet troll , is IN DT trolls usually have obscure usernames , no profile pic ( or a generic NN ) and if PRP track their previous comments on other threads , PRP will see IN PRP have attacked using DT same format over and over ; in addition to attempting to lure NNS to DT disinformation sites , where PRP VBP compensated to engage them in a futile “ debate ” , waste NNS ’s NN and distract them from spending NN increasing awareness in their local community , and doing REAL research ongeoengineering . Do n’t let DT trolls cause PRP to feel stupid for considering IN geoengineering MD be a reality and suppress your awareness . Keep watching DT sky and research information beyond DT fixed mainstream search engines . Watch DT documentaries , Look Up ! and What in DT NN are PRP Spraying ? , take notes and look up DT information presented . DT TRUTH is RB for anyone WDT is intelligent enough to look past DT deceit & lies . WHAT PRP CAN DO TO AVOID DT TROLLS 1 ) Never “ reply to ” them ; ( do not fall for their tactics ) . 2 ) REPORT them , because what PRP ’re doing is a form of cyber - BULLYING . 3 ) On your page , DELETE their comments and BLOCK them . Share this information to increase awareness and disempower their lies . Visit reputable sites such as NNP Skywatch and GeoengineeringWatch.org for more information about how geoengineering adversely affects our NN , and is damaging our NN ’s ability to sustain life ."

In DT other corner … PRP 's not clear . But whatever PRP was , PRP was huge , PRP had tentacles and PRP put up a hell of a fight . Undersea photographer Deron Verbeck caught DT aftermath of this mysterious scrap when he snapped a picture of DT offending shark , scarred all along its flank with strange circular patterns and dots . According to a NN published June 3 in DT Journal of Fish Biology , EX are only a handful of creatures in Hawaiian waters capable of creating scars IN DT , and PRP are all enormous cephalopods . While PRP 's impossible to be sure what exactly scarred DT shark , DT researchers argue IN PRP MD have been a "" phantom of DT deep "" — another name for DT elusive giant squid ( Architeuthis dux ) . Related : Giant squid filmed alive for second NN in history . Here 's DT video . Giant squids are mysterious denizens of DT deep ocean , thought to be able to grow anywhere from 33 to 43 feet ( 10 to 13 m ) in length . PRP are poorly studied because PRP live so deep underwater — typically about 1,000 feet ( 300 m ) down or more , DT researchers wrote . Their deep dwellings put DT giant squids not only out of reach of most humans , but RB JJ MD - be predators . DT oceanic whitetip shark MD be an exception , DT researchers wrote . Because DT sharks are known to dive to extreme depths on foraging missions , PRP 's feasible IN an unlucky whitetip MD find itself snoot - to - sucker with a giant squid . DT MD be what happened to DT scarred shark in DT photo . According to DT researchers , DT series of circular marks along DT shark 's back and side are shaped exactly IN DT suckers on a large squid 's tentacles . From DT size of DT markings , DT offending squid must have been at least DT same size as DT shark ( at least 7 feet , or 2 meters , long ) and was possibly even larger , DT researchers wrote . Only three types of squids known to inhabit Hawaiian waters MD have created DT marks , DT team concluded : a squid in DT genus Thysanoteuthis or Megalocranchia ( both known to grow up to nearly 7 feet ) or DT giant squid . JJ other details of DT encounter remain a mystery . For example , who threw DT first punch ? ( Or bite ?

However , "" DT lack of any obvious wounding suggests PRP were more likely defensive ( i.e. DT shark attacked DT cephalopod ) , "" DT researchers wrote in DT NN . "" Similar scarring patterns are seen on sperm whales , well - known predators of large cephalopods .

And some security analysts estimated DT security bill at $ 40 million — a big jump from DT 2011 royal wedding because of heightened threat levels in Britain following a string of terror attacks over DT past 18 months . British ministers say any JJ money used for DT wedding is money well spent , arguing DT event will encourage more tourists — especially Americans — to visit Britain . But no evidence was supplied by DT NN to show IN DT was DT case in 2011 . "" These royal weddings epitomize DT British monarchy 's fondness for reverse Robin Hood economics , whereby wealth is redistributed from ordinary NNS , via their taxes , to a fabulously rich family WDT on such occasions appears not very modern , at all ; in fact , PRP all feels rather feudal , "" VBD Patrick Basham , DT founding director of DT Democracy Institute , a Washington - and London - based libertarian NN tank . He told VOA : "" A royal family savvier about DT optics MD have refused , for example , taxpayers footing DT vast security bill . Instead , wedding sponsorship MD have been procured from DT British fashion , music and tourism industries , which MD serve to VB taxpayers off DT hook — a huge PR win — and provide significant JJ branding opportunities for leading domestic companies and entrepreneurs .

EX ’s a marathon for everyone — from NNS who just VBP to have a good NN to those seeking an obstacle course . And do n't forget those who are checking races off their bucket lists . These long - distance runs are so expensive , NN - consuming , and in - demand IN companies are spending money on races either for DT prestige and DT advertising of a permanent corporate sponsorship , or just to VB a simple , lucrative return on investment . But just what are DT economics behind marathons ? And where does all DT money VB ? Read on to find out more about DT costs associated with these races . DT Dollars and Cents of Running a Marathon Marathons are a relatively inelastic good , so even if DT cost to participate goes up , NNS still take part . And PRP 're normally willing to shell out a lot of cash for DT experience . Some of DT elite races charge participants different fees from selection lotteries to registration costs . And these charges can be quite hefty . DT bigger DT race , DT bigger DT cost . Let 's look at DT NNP York City Marathon — CD of DT NN 's most coveted races . Prospective participants have to meet certain eligibility criteria before PRP can be guaranteed entry . DT organization holds a selection lottery just for a chance to participate in DT actual marathon . Then EX 's DT registration fee , which depends on your status . U.S. residents who are members of DT NNP York Road Runners group pay a $ 255 registration fee . DT fee increases to $ 295 for residents who are nonmembers , and to $ 358 for non-U.S. residents .﻿﻿ DT costs of putting on a marathon begin to accumulate months before DT race actually happens . First , DT organizer has to examine a map and decide where to hold DT race . Armed with a meticulously planned - out route , DT organizer needs to VB DT necessary permits from DT city and permission to use quasi-public spaces and any private property IN parking lots . Once DT permits are secure , DT organizer needs to consult a USA Track & Field Road Course Certifier about having DT distance certified .﻿﻿ After all , no NN wants to be DT person who holds a 25 - mile marathon by mistake . DT road course certifier charges a small fee for these services . Finally , PRP ’s NN to start getting DT word out to DT NN . Advertising costs can drop dramatically if social NN picks up DT race . But even still , organizers will still have to budget for radio , print , and online ad space . Race day is DT most expensive part of a marathon . Not only does DT course need to be set up with NN tables , food tables , and portable toilets , PRP all needs to be done by NNS . If no NN volunteers , DT event organizer needs to hire and pay its staff for DT day . Staffing expenses come on top of DT cost of having an on - site JJ team in case of an emergency . This is an important requirement set forth by DT insurance policy DT race organizer will RB need to buy . And let 's not forget DT immense cost of security to ensure crowd control . According to a Philadelphia half - marathon , DT cost to secure a half - marathon with a simple police presence can range between $ 30,000 and $ 120,000 .﻿﻿ DT racers who have paid a hefty registration fee to run are RB an expensive part of DT race . According to DT Washington Post , participation t- shirts , bibs , pins , goodie bags , and medals cost DT Marine Corps Marathon about $ 13 per person in 2013 .﻿﻿ Smaller races MD have a higher cost per person as PRP can’t benefit as much from economies of scale . Race timing systems are perhaps DT biggest hidden cost to DT racers . Usually consisting of a cheap radio frequency identification ( RFID ) attached to a race bib , a timing system can cost thousands . Hiring a company to NN a smaller event can be cheaper in DT short term , with machine and chip rentals costing a few dollars per runner .﻿﻿ DT biggest source of revenue for marathons is DT entry participation fee . For races organized as charitable fundraisers , high registration fees are n’t a large concern as DT runner knows IN any excess will VB to help fight breast cancer or to build a JJ school track field . Races run in DT name of a charity can attract big sponsors who VBP to give back to DT community and benefit from supporting a good cause . DT Washington Post broke down DT cost of hosting a marathon and found IN for every $ 99 a runner paid to participate , sponsors contributed $ 58 .﻿ ﻿ Corporations are incentivized to organize running events and prestigious marathons because of their popularity . As with all goods , DT more popular and in - demand PRP is , DT more an organization can charge . Realistically , DT Boston Marathon , London Marathon , and NNP York City Marathon MD double their prices , and although EX MD be an outrage , their limited good ( racing spots ) MD be filled by NNS who value DT experience enough to pay DT inflated costs . Some of DT NN 's biggest marathons attract NNS from all over DT NN . DT means big bucks for local economies . For example , roughly 30 % of DT drawing applicants accepted to run in DT 2020 NNP York City Marathon were international runners .﻿﻿ Runners who come from outside DT hosting metropolitan area inject a lot of money into hotels , food , and entertainment . All of this is true for other less prestigious but uber - popular races . Some popular examples include DT Rock n Roll Marathon and Walt Disney ’s ( DIS ) Walt Disney NNP Marathon , as well as Color Me Rad , Tough Mudder , and other running events . Races WDT belong to DT latter category RB have DT financial benefit of being untimed , which leads to more money for DT organizer as well as DT city itself . While modern marathon racing is more than a century old , DT participation numbers have increased wildly in DT past decade . As more NNS embrace DT healthy benefits of running , along with its low - cost and minimal barriers to entry , marathon organizers are shaping up to see their numbers continue to grow each NN ."

From a pesky foot pain to more serious symptoms IN numbness , your feet often show symptoms of NN before any other part of your body . No hair on your feet or toes “ Bald ” feet can be a sign of poor circulation as a result of vascular NN . What can PRP do ? Although DT hair MD never return ( which is n’t necessarily a terrible thing ! ) , PRP ’ll VB to see a doctor about improving your circulation and getting your vascular NN in check . If PRP have a wound on your foot WDT just wo n’t heal , PRP MD be at risk for diabetes . Elevated blood glucose levels over NN can lead to nerve damage in DT feet , and so PRP MD not feel an ulcer on your DT bottom of your foot . Left untreated , this can lead to serious consequences , even to amputation . For women , cold feet MD indicate an “ underfunctioning ” thyroid problem , which is DT gland WDT regulates temperature and metabolism . Poor circulation is another possible cause for both men and women . DT solution : Aside from potential thyroid medications , EX ’s not much PRP can do other than bundle up your feet in thick wool socks and slippers to keep warm . If CD or more of your toenails starts to thicken , VB color , and separate from DT skin , PRP probably means PRP have a fungal infection living beneath DT toenail . NNS with diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , and other immune deficiencies MD be more susceptible than others in contracting toenail fungus . DT solution : See a podiatrist or internist for care and treatment . If your big toe suddenly blows up , PRP MD be experiencing gout . This medieval sounding NN is actually a form of arthritis and is caused by DT build up of DT natural substance , uric acid . Why DT big toe ? DT excess uric acid forms in DT body part with DT lowest temperature , which just happens to be your big toe . Having a persistent “ pins and needles ” feeling in your feet , or actual loss of feeling , can be a sign of peripheral neuropathy . Peripheral neuropathy means EX ’s been some damage to your peripheral nervous system and can be caused by several things , but DT most common are diabetes and alcohol abuse . DT solution : See your doctor and explain your symptoms . DT skin condition psoriasis can RB manifest itself in your toenails . Affecting up to half of those living with psoriasis MD find their toenails ( and fingernails ) to have JJ tiny holes . NNS with DT related joint condition , psoriatic arthritis , RB MD experience this issue . DT solution : EX are currently several medications on DT market to treat DT symptoms associated with psoriasis and psoriatic psoriasis . A shooting pain in your heel MD be a sign of plantar fasciitis , which means DT band of connective tissue running along DT bottom of your foot is inflamed . DT pain is usually concentrated in DT heel and gets worse throughout DT day . DT solution : If PRP have persistant pain , see a podiatrist and avoid high heeled shoes . Sunken toenails MD be a sign of anemia . Anemia often shows up in toenails with as concave or spoonlike indentations in DT toes ’ nail beds , and is most prevalent in moderate - to - severe NNS . To be sure , your doctor will VB to do a complete blood count . Sudden , CD - off instances of foot cramping MD just mean PRP ’re dehydrated or exercising too hard , but if PRP have chronic foot cramping , PRP MD be lacking calcium , potassium , or magnesium in your diet . If PRP experience frequent cramping , try stretching your feet before bed and eating more calcium - rich foods . Sore toe joints MD be a sign of DT degenerative joint NN , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . RA typically attacks smaller joints first – IN joints in DT wrist and toes , so pay attention if PRP have a persistent achy feeling or swelling . DT inability to raise DT foot upward from DT heel is called “ drop foot . ” This MD be DT result of nerve damage or trauma in your neck , back , or leg . If PRP experience this , PRP should contact your doctor immediately , since this can be reversed or permanent , depending on what caused PRP and how PRP ’s treated . Dry , flaky skin on DT feet MD be a sign of athlete ’s foot , which is a fungal infection . Athlete ’s foot usually shows up between DT first two toes and usually starts as dry , itchy skin WDT then progresses to inflammation and blisters . If PRP suspect PRP have athlete ’s foot , be sure to keep your feet clean and dry . Toes WDT show a variation of color – from white , to blue , to red – MD be experiencing a symptom of Raynaud ’s NN . DT colors appear as DT vessels spasm . If PRP experience this , see a doctor to make sure EX is n’t an underlying condition ."

Biscardi ’s company had , at DT NN , a market capitalization of more than $ 10 billion . “ I gotta tell PRP something , I nearly s — . ” DT ’s Biscardi describing his first Bigfoot encounter to CNBC . He says he ’s personally seen DT cryptid seven times in 45 NNS , starting in Northern California in 1973 . Biscardi ’s initial encounter sparked a series of videos and a website WDT refers to him , perhaps inaccurately ( medically speaking , at least ) as “ DT Godfather of Bigfoot . ” Biscardi ’s company ( stock ticker : BGFT ) was registered in 2013 with DT Securities and Exchange Commission . PRP ’s currently what ’s known as a “ pink sheets firm , ” which means PRP ’s in DT same category as penny stocks , shell corporations and other less - than - savory investments . In filings with DT SEC , BGFT says its stock became eligible for trading on June 28 . This week , DT current share price was $ 50.01 , which , with number of shares in DT company outstanding ( 200 million ) , created DT $ 10 billion figure . DT thing is , no NN understands where DT $ 50.01 figure came from , because , as CNBC reports , BGFT ’s current assets are “ $ 221 in cash along with 73 original casts of Bigfoot footprints , a 109 - inch skeleton and a rubber suit from a 2008 Bigfoot hoax . ” ( Filings RB note IN Bigfoot is known by 15 names across DT NN , such as “ Yeti ” in Tibet , “ Yowie ” in Australia and “ Hibagon ” in Japan .

PRP VBP PRP was AA Flight 77 because of this convenient piece of “ wreckage ” recovered at DT site : CD of our sources sent over a video , purportedly from a Pentagon security camera facing DT impact site . DT frame paused at 5 seconds appears to show a fast - moving projectile slamming into CD side of DT Pentagon from DT right . This object has no wings whatsoever . DT logical conclusion is IN DT object is a missile . After DT impact , a fireball quickly becomes thick , gray smoke . At 1:49 DT video cuts to some live - action footage of DT Pentagon . This footage was shot from a position opposite from DT first film , but still facing DT point of impact . However , DT first NNS on DT scene who were n’t first responders ( police , firefighters , medics ) found no evidence IN a plane actually struck DT Pentagon . DT wreckage did not make “ forensic sense , ” and raised questions immediately from objective witnesses . DT female CNN reporter begins this video by saying IN a certain “ Bob Franken and an eyewitness ” had concluded IN DT plane landed “ short of DT Pentagon ” – meaning PRP never made PRP RB far . DT entire CNN breaking NN segment , which includes DT above video content , is shown in another YouTube video . CNN ’s military affairs correspondent Jaime McIntyre VBD no plane even fell short of DT mark . After walking up to DT smoldering Pentagon , he observed : “ From my close - up inspection , EX ’s no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near DT Pentagon … DT only pieces left …are small enough to pick up in your hand . EX are no large tail sections , wing sections , fuselage – nothing IN DT anywhere around which MD indicate IN DT entire plane crashed into DT side of DT Pentagon and then caused DT side to collapse . ” DT demolished Pentagon floors did n’t collapse until 45 minutes after impact , and DT burn marks were inconsistent with those seen at DT WTC Twin Towers in NYC – RB allegedly toppled by mere airplanes . By DT way , in terms of construction physics , DT heat generated by DT amount of jet fuel on a plane ( based on fuel tank capacity , rate of consumption , and NN from take - off ) is not hot enough to “ melt steel , ” as DT mainstream NN repeated ad nauseum . DT damage seen at DT Pentagon crash site is more consistent with DT of a plane crash – but was EX even a plane ? JJ investigators say DT answer is no . This video analyzes DT damage done to DT Pentagon . DT affected area measured about 65 feet wide and 73 feet tall – DT height of DT building . DT narrator informs : “ From wingtip to wingtip , a 757 is 124 feet , 10 inches . From nose to tail a 757 is 155 feet 3 inches in length , and DT height is 44 feet 6 inches . How does a plane of those dimensions [ size ] fit into a hole only 65 feet across ? ” Just to recap , PRP have first - hand reports IN no significant plane wreckage was found at DT Pentagon explosion site and DT hole was too small to have been made by a 757 jet airplane . Both reports were buried while DT mainstream NN continued to bleat DT cover story in order to launch DT unending “ War on Terror ” under which PRP are currently oppressed . Is EX more evidence to weigh ? Try this on for size . This video reported IN NO CD DIED right after this alleged jet crashed into a busy office building during working hours . Just how is DT supposed to happen , given DT physical forces involved ? Were DT NNS shown being transported on stretchers actually paid , professional crisis actors ? Apparently , Bush , Cheney , and DT other NWO leaders in charge of DT NNP believed – and still believe – IN PRP DT NNS are dumb as stumps . PRP swallowed their incredibly evil lies and let them take away our civil rights under DT oxymoronic Patriot Act . Most NNS – or “ sheeple ” – who are either too busy or just not interested do believe IN giving up our cherished freedoms is “ DT price PRP must pay ” to ensure “ national security . ” Occasionally , though , someone important admits DT truth . In this short video snippet from an interview with Neil Degrasse Tyson , former NNP Bill NNP mentions DT “ Pentagon bomb . ” Although lifted from its original context , NNP seems to be answering a question about 9/11 being an inside job WDT was discussed by DT NNP presidential candidates during DT debates – before anything happened on 9/11 . A slip of DT tongue ? A guilty conscience ? A mistake made while tired ? PRP decide . Now , consider this eye - witness testimony . A woman alleging to be a Pentagon employee inside DT building during DT explosion on 9/11 made this video . At 2:19 , she says : “ As I was coming out of DT Pentagon I did n’t see any evidence of metal , airplane seats , luggage – nothing WDT MD give me any indication IN PRP was a plane WDT had hit DT building . ” No NN she encountered had any jet fuel on their bodies , and no NN in her area . This concerned citizen ’s call to action is to open a federal grand jury to decide if PRP DT NNS are DT victims of highest - level perjury and obstruction of justice . DT “ official story ” is BUNK , plain and simple . Stop DT fictional “ War on Terror ” forced on a nation still reeling from shock . Dismantle DT pork - belly , boondoggle organizations thereby created , notably DHS and TSA . Refocus DT national narrative on DT truth , and for pete ’s sake , stop patronizing PRP . PRP taxpayers funded DT ridiculous “ 9/11 Commission Report ” which concluded IN DT guilty party was – are PRP ready for this ? – DT Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) . Even 9/11 Commissioner Tim Roemer spilled DT beans when he told CNN , thinking back about DT Pentagon attack : “ PRP were worried , especially when I was standing in front of DT Pentagon DT night , seeing CD of our fortresses pried open by a missile – uh , airplane . ” Have n’t PRP had enough lies ?"

[ 1 ] Found in all temperate to tropical oceans yet rarely seen , DT oarfish family contains three species in two genera . CD of these , DT giant oarfish ( Regalecus glesne ) , is DT longest bony fish alive , growing up to 8 m ( 26 ft ) in length . DT common name oarfish is thought to be in reference either to their highly compressed and elongated bodies , or to DT now discredited belief IN DT fish "" row "" themselves through DT NN with their pelvic fins . [ 2 ] DT family name Regalecidae is derived from DT Latin regalis , meaning "" royal "" . DT occasional beachings of oarfish after storms , and their habit of lingering at DT surface when sick or dying , make oarfish a probable source of JJ NN serpent tales . Although DT larger species are considered game fish and are fished commercially to a minor extent , oarfish are rarely caught alive ; their flesh is not well regarded for eating due to its gelatinous consistency . [ 3 ] DT dorsal fin originates from above DT ( relatively large ) eyes and runs DT entire length of DT fish . Of DT approximately 400 dorsal fin rays , DT first 10 to 13 are elongated to varying degrees , forming a trailing crest embellished with reddish spots and flaps of skin at DT ray tips . DT pelvic fins are similarly elongated and adorned , reduced to CD to five rays each . DT pectoral fins are greatly reduced and situated low on DT body . DT anal fin is completely absent and DT caudal fin MD be reduced or absent , as well , with DT body tapering to a fine point . All fins lack true spines . At least CD account , from researchers in NNP Zealand , described DT oarfish as giving off "" electric shocks "" when touched . [ 2 ] IN other members of its order , DT oarfish has a small yet highly protrusible oblique mouth with no visible teeth . DT body is scaleless and DT skin is covered with easily abraded , silvery guanine . In DT streamer fish ( Agrostichthys parkeri ) , DT skin is clad with hard tubercles . All species lack gas bladders and DT number of gill rakers is variable . Oarfish coloration is RB variable ; DT flanks are commonly covered with irregular bluish to blackish streaks , black dots , and squiggles . These markings quickly fade following death . DT giant oarfish is by far DT largest member of DT family at a published total length of 8 m ( 26 ft ) — with unconfirmed reports of 11 m ( 36 ft ) and 17 m ( 56 ft ) [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] specimens — and 270 kg ( 600 lb ) in weight . [ 7 ] DT streamer fish is known to reach 3 m ( 10 ft ) in length , [ 8 ] while DT largest recorded specimen of Regalecus russelii measured 5.4 m ( 18 ft ) . [ 9 ] Oarfish have DT longest known length of any living species of bony fish . [ 10 ] DT oarfish is thought to inhabit DT epipelagic to mesopelagic ocean layers , ranging from 200 meters ( 660 ft ) to 1,000 meters ( 3,300 ft ) and is rarely seen on DT surface . A few have been found still barely alive , but usually if PRP floats to DT surface , PRP dies . At DT depths DT oarfish live , EX are few or no currents . As a result , PRP build little muscle mass and PRP cannot survive in shallower turbulent NN . [ 11 ] DT members of DT family are known to have a worldwide range . However , human encounters with live oarfish are rare , and distribution information is collated from records of oarfish caught or washed ashore . [ 2 ] Oarfish were first described in 1772 . [ 12 ] Rare encounters with divers and accidental catches have supplied what little is known of oarfish ethology ( behavior ) and ecology . Oarfish are solitary animals and MD frequent significant depths up to 1,000 m ( 3,300 ft ) . An oarfish measuring 3.3 m ( 11 ft ) and 63.5 kg ( 140 lb ) was reported to have been caught in February 2003 using a fishing rod baited with squid at Skinningrove , NNP Kingdom . [ 13 ] A photograph on display in bars , restaurants , guesthouses and markets around Laos and Thailand captioned "" Queen of Nāgas seized by DT American Army at Mekhong River , Laos Military Base , on June 27 , 1973 , with DT length of 7.80 metres [ 25.6 ft ] "" is , as far as DT caption goes , a hoax . DT photograph itself is real , however , and was taken by Dr. Leo Smith of DT Field Museum , of an oarfish found in September 1996 by NNP NNPS Navy SEAL trainees on DT coast of Coronado , California , USA . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In 2001 , an oarfish was filmed alive in situ : DT 1.5 - metre ( 4.9 - foot ) fish was spotted by a group of U.S. Navy personnel during DT inspection of a buoy in DT Bahamas . [ 16 ] DT oarfish was observed to propel itself by an amiiform mode of swimming ; DT is , rhythmically undulating DT dorsal fin while keeping DT body itself straight . Perhaps indicating a feeding posture , oarfish have been observed swimming in a vertical orientation , with their long axis perpendicular to DT ocean surface . In this posture , DT downstreaming light MD silhouette DT oarfishes ' prey , making them easier to spot . In July 2008 , NNS captured footage of DT rare fish swimming in its natural habitat in DT mesopelagic zone in DT Gulf of Mexico . PRP is DT first ever confirmed sighting of an oarfish at depth , as most specimens are discovered dying at DT NN surface or washed ashore . DT fish was estimated to be between five and ten metres ( 16 and 33 ft ) in length . [ 17 ] As part of DT SERPENT Project , five observations of apparently healthy oarfish Regalecus glesne by remotely operated vehicles were reported from DT northern Gulf of Mexico between 2008 and 2011 at depths within DT epipelagic and mesopelagic zones . [ 18 ] These observations include DT deepest verified record of R. glesne ( 463–492 m or 1,519 –1,614 ft ) . [ CD ] From December 2009 to March 2010 , unusual numbers of DT slender oarfish Regalecus russelii [ 9 ] ( 竜宮の使い “ Ryūgū - No - Tsukai ” , ) known in Japanese folklore as DT Messenger from DT NNP God 's Palace , appeared in DT waters and on DT beaches of Japan , DT appearance of which is VBN to portend earthquakes . [ 20 ] After DT 2011 Fukushima earthquake and tsunami which killed over 20,000 NNS , JJ pointed to DT oarfish from 2009 – ⁠2010 to build up this myth . [ 21 ] In 2016 , Animal NNP aired an episode of DT television series River Monsters named "" Deep NNP Demon "" in which Jeremy Wade was filmed during an encounter with a live oarfish while diving . DT oarfish at this location seemed to be using a buoy anchor chain as a guide to ascend to DT surface . On his second diving attempt , he was able to film two live oarfish as PRP ascended relatively close to DT surface . This is DT only known footage of human interaction with a healthy oarfish in its own environment . Wade was even able to touch CD of DT oarfish with his hand . DT oarfish were propelling themselves by an amiiform mode of swimming as noted by other sightings . [ 22 ] In January 2019 two oarfish were found alive in DT nets of fisherman on DT Japanese island of Okinawa . [ 21 ] Oarfish feed primarily on zooplankton , selectively straining tiny euphausiids , shrimp , and other crustaceans from DT NN . Small fish , jellyfish , and squid are RB taken . Large open - ocean carnivores are all likely predators of oarfish . DT oceanodromous Regalecus glesne is recorded as spawning off Mexico from July to December ; all species are presumed to not guard their eggs , and release brightly coloured , buoyant eggs , up to six millimetres ( 0.24 in ) across , which are incorporated into DT zooplankton . DT eggs hatch after about three weeks into highly active larvae WDT feed on other zooplankton . DT larvae have little resemblance to DT adults , with long dorsal and pelvic fins and extensible mouths . [ 2 ] Larvae and juveniles have been observed drifting just below DT surface . In contrast , adult oarfish are rarely seen at DT surface when not sick or injured . • Fishes : An Introduction to ichthyology . Peter B. Moyle and Joseph J. Cech , Jr ; p. 338 . Printed in 2004 .

These_DT links_NNS will_MD help_VB you_PRP learn_VB more_JJR :_:","­ PRP is amazing , but DT total amount of gold in DT NN is a surprisingly small q­uantity . Here 's how PRP can calculate DT total amount WDT is available . If PRP look at a page IN this NN , or if PRP look PRP up in an encyclopedia , PRP will find IN DT annual worldwide production of gold is something IN 50 million troy ounces per NN . Gold has a specific gravity of 19.3 , meaning IN PRP is 19.3 times heavier than NN . So gold weighs 19.3 kilograms per liter . A liter is a cube WDT measures 10 centimeters ( about 4 inches ) on a side . EX are 32.15 troy ounces in a kilogram . Therefore , DT NN produces a cube of gold WDT is about 4.3 meters ( about 14 feet ) on each side every NN . In other words , all of DT gold produced worldwide in CD NN MD just about fit in DT average person 's living room ! This cube weighs 1,555,210 kilograms ( 3,110,420 pounds ) . A recent spot price for gold was $ 256.10 U.S. -- using DT number , all of DT gold produced in a NN is worth $ 12,805,000,000 . DT 's a lot of money , but not an unimaginable amount . For example , DT 's about how much DT Pentagon spent launching DT GPS satellite system . NASA 's budget in 1998 was $ 13.6 billion . Figuring out DT total amount of gold WDT has been produced by man is a little harder . To VB at some kind of estimate , let 's figure IN DT NN has been producing gold at 50 million ounces a NN for 200 NNS . DT number is probably a little high , but when PRP figure IN DT Aztecs and DT Egyptians produced a fair amount of gold for a long NN , PRP 's probably not too far off . Fifty million ounces * 200 NNS = 10 billion ounces . Ten billion ounces of gold MD fit into a cube roughly 25 meters ( about 82 feet ) on a side . Consider IN DT Washington Monument measures 55 feet by 55 feet at its base and is 555 feet tall ( 17 x 17 x 170 m ) . DT means IN if PRP MD somehow gather every scrap of gold WDT man has ever mined into CD place , PRP MD only build about CD - third of DT Washington Monument . Platinum is even more scarce than gold . Only 3.6 million troy ounces are produced per NN . Its specific gravity is 21.45 , and PRP was discovered in DT 18th century , not in 3,000 B.C. If PRP assume IN DT NN has produced 3.6 million ounces per NN for 50 NNS to estimate DT total worldwide supply , all of DT platinum in DT NN MD fit in a cube WDT is 6.3 meters ( about 20 feet ) on a side . In other words , all of DT platinum in DT entire NN MD easily fit in DT average home ! These links will help PRP learn more :"

Let s begin having a look at some modern propaganda techniques . On two separate occasions , someone mentioned something to me about terrorism , or DT war on terror , and I responded by asking "" PRP do VB IN EX is indisputable scientific evidence WDT proves beyond any doubt IN DT Twin Towers were demolished with explosives , right ? "" For me , any discussion of terrorism has to begin with DT understanding of what actually happened on 9 - 11 , rather than what PRP were told to believe . On both occasions , DT person I was talking to responded by saying "" I heard IN DT NN of Mexico saw a UFO . "" DT first NN this happened , I shook my head and thought to myself "" what DT hell is this girl thinking ? Maybe DT NN of Mexico sniffs glue and sees all kinds of things , but what does CD thing have to do with DT other ? How did she make DT jump from 9 - 11 to Mexican UFOs without a sentence between DT two subjects ? DT second NN PRP happened I thought to myself "" Holy shit . This is a conditioned response . "" Somehow , DT herd has been taught to immediately make an association with UFOs , Bigfoot , or DT ghost of Elvis whenever someone talks to them about crimes committed by NNS within our NN . This is incredibly convenient for a NN comprised of crooks and perverts , but how did PRP accomplish this ? If PRP take a look at a typical "" NN website "" , youll see all kinds of revelations about DT 9 - 11 attacks , DT FEMA concentration camps , and possibly DT latest information on DT shadowy and elusive group known only as "" DT NNP NNP Order , "" and youll RB see DT latest crop circle designs , DT most recent UFO photos , DT image of Christ in an NN cube , a first - hand account from DT man who wrestled Bigfoot , DT true location of DT sunken city of Atlantis , and all manner of non-sense designed to make any important information appear ridiculous by this association . DT Daily Globe is CD of two newspapers I m aware of DT exists for this same purpose . This is CD of DT thin papers WDT usually sports a headline involving 800 - pound Siamese twins suing each other for and against surgical separation , or DT poor man whose wife was mysteriously transformed into a hammer - head shark . Because everyone knows IN these newspapers epitomize incredulity , PRP re DT perfect place to print any information WDT needs to be immediately discredited . "" ALIEN ABDUCTEE SAYS U.S. GOVT BEHIND 9 - 11 ATTACKS "" MD be a probable headline . See how this works ? PRP dont have to buy DT paper . Nobody does . A few copies are prominently displayed near every supermarket checkout line , and this is what NNS remember when someone tries to warn them IN DT NN of this nation has gotten completely out of control . Their mind makes an association between DT important information , and DT ridiculous information , and PRP feel confident IN its nothing PRP need to worry about , but PRP MD carry on DT silly conversation about UFOs and stuff just to be polite . Silently PRP re convinced IN because PRP tried to warn them about their criminal NN , PRP must RB spend your nights on DT roof searching DT skies for E.T . Theres RB no shortage of TV and movie characters who openly insist IN our NN is involved in all kinds of heinous activity , but every last CD of them is a lunatic . Cosmo Kramer is a recent example . He promotes alternative medicine , doesnt trust DT NN , and besides DT , hes completely off DT wall . Not DT type of lunatic PRP MD fear , but hes definitely not someone PRP MD look to for reliable information , or even sane discourse . Look closely at every TV character who questions or mistrusts DT NN , and PRP will see IN this behavior is linked with CD abnormal personality after another . DT sub -conscious lesson here is IN anyone who questions DT NN or suggests PRP MD be involved in any crime has an abnormal personality , so PRP can quickly dismiss everything he has to say . Through decades of repetition of these messages , youve been taught to ignore any criminality on DT part of anyone in our NN , and anyone who might make such an accusation . While PRP were being so trained , PRP were robbed of your wealth and freedom . EX are NNS commonly referred to as "" NN theorists "" . In reality , absolutely no NN hangs around theorizing about conspiracies , but this label is applied to anyone who feels a civic duty to warn other Americans of criminal activity within their NN . DT "" NN theorist "" is a character WDT only exists on television and in movies , and this character , who is always a lunatic , was created for PRP to make an association with when someone tries to warn PRP about NN crimes . DT result is IN when someone tries to explain to PRP IN your own NN is doing all PRP can to either kill or enslave PRP , he MD as well be crying to PRP about his wife turning into a shark during his most recent UFO abduction , regardless of any proof he has . For most Americans , DT NNS on TV have replaced their normal human society , and DT exchange of ideas PRP MD have once had with neighbors and others in their community is now fed to them via DT almighty tube . PRP are fed two sides of a debate , allowed to choose between them , and this choice allows them to feel a bond with other NNS of CD opinion or DT other , and lets them feel IN PRP re wise enough to have an opinion in DT matter , and free enough to express PRP . DT reality here is IN neither side of DT debate ever contains DT entire truth of DT matter , but just enough information , or misinformation , to make them feel PRP re informed , and give them something to enter a futile debate with , if PRP did actually talk to their neighbor . Political correctness silenced DT rest of them by teaching a reluctance to saying or hearing anything controversial or possibly disturbing . What Americans are shown on TV are allegedly DT products of various independent broadcasting companies who compete for viewers who will supposedly watch DT commercial messages WDT are injected into DT entertainment , but if this is DT case , why DT incredible similarity between DT allegedly competing companies ? Wouldnt PRP VBP IN eventually CD network or Hollywood studio might experiment with a sane and respectable character who doesnt trust DT NN ? Are EX any other typified characters WDT exist on all networks ? As PRP happens , EX are JJ . Just to name a few ; every father is an idiot , as is every private citizen who owns a firearm , every mother is an over - worked and under - appreciated slave , everyone who works for DT NN is a hero who endlessly risks his life for your protection , and everyone who sells drugs is black or hispanic . Every Arab is a screaming madman , and every Jew is kind , gentle and wise . Every homosexual is moral , kind , and intelligent , and everyone who lives in a rural area of DT country is an idiot . I dont need to VB on . PRP can probably name a few of your own , but DT important point here is IN DT same personality traits transcend all characters on all networks . This is obviously no accident . If PRP can see common themes and messages WDT are being foisted upon DT NN by all networks , PRP proves IN either EX is no real competition between them and PRP all share a common political goal , or IN all of their programing is being influenced or dictated by an outside entity , or both . Nothing else can explain DT incredible similarity of stereotyped personality traits in all these fictional characters . Now DT next logical step MD be to recognize and list as JJ of these common themes as possible , and see if PRP all serve a particular political agenda . Just by skimming DT surface PRP see an effort to thwart private gun ownership , discourage masculinity , encourage homosexuality , promote women to "" head of household "" status , and foster hatred against all Arabs . Then EX are DT constant attacks on DT "" antiquated document "" known as DT Bill of Rights , which permeate every episode of "" Law and Order "" and "" CSI "" ** ( if not for DT silly forth amendment , all those mangled NNS MD be alive , kind of thing ) . Whose interests does this propaganda serve ? Who benefits by trying to shape JJ opinion in this direction ? Certainly not DT TV viewer , because as well see in DT next episode of our action - packed adventure through main - stream NN propaganda , DT TV viewers been taught to work against his own self - interests . "" DT C.I.A. owns everyone of any significance in DT major NN . "" ---- William Colby , former Director of DT CIA "" History is a collection of lies WDT are no longer being disputed . ""  Napoleon Bonaparte ** first - hand info here  I was subjected to a lot of TV when I was trapped in a motel for six months , otherwise I havent allowed DT evil device into my home for more than 25 NNS ."

PRP MD reach this milestone much earlier if PRP 've led a foot - active lifestyle . By age 50 , PRP MD have lost nearly half of DT fatty padding on DT soles of your feet . And PRP MD be wearing a shoe WDT 's a size bigger than what PRP wore in your 20s , in part because of weight gain WDT puts greater pres-sure on your feet , and in part because your ligaments and tendons have lost some of their elasticity ( which RB predisposes them to potentially painful ruptures or microtears ) . If PRP 've given birth , PRP have another reason for DT increase in shoe size : hormones released during pregnancy RB cause ligaments to relax . Menopause , too , can affect foot NN . Unless countered by medications or exercise , DT loss of estrogen and other hormonal changes generally lead to lower bone density , resulting in osteoporosis if enough bone mass is lost . This condition can raise DT risk of stress fractures ( hairline breaks ) in any of DT bones of DT foot . Unless treated appropriately , stress fractures can worsen and cause DT bones to shift out of place .

Following an eight - strong group of teen soldiers and their adult prisoner of war , PRP is sensual , and gorgeous and intensely , continuously disturbing . DT kids – Dog , Lady , Bigfoot , Boom - Boom , Rambo , Swede , Wolf , Smurf – are left to their own devices except for DT occasional visit from “ DT Messenger ” , who works for whatever organisation has recruited them . So PRP scrap and kiss and fire their AK - 47s into DT sky . Alejandro Landes , DT film ’s 39 - NN - old director , says PRP does n’t matter who PRP ’re fighting for . “ Colombia ’s been war - torn for so JJ decades . I ’ve seen DT violence happen from DT left and I ’ve seen PRP happen from DT right . My grandfather ’s favourite place in DT NN , his farm WDT he worked all his life to buy , became DT headquarters for DT most gruesome rightwing paramilitary group , DT AUC , and I ’ve had part of my family kidnapped by guerrillas . ” Who , exactly ? “ My grandfather ’s sister , my cousin … things IN DT . ” Were PRP freed ? “ Some yes , some no . So DT is something WDT I had seen and experienced . ” These experiences inspired and informed Monos . PRP ’re given no specifics of NN and place – PRP ’s somewhere in Latin America . Landes , who lives in NNP York , has Colombian roots but grew up in Ecuador , his parents having left Medellín in DT 1980s to escape DT violence . To find his actors , he and his producers sifted through 800 tapes , selecting 25 possibles totake part in a mock training camp for four weeks in DT Andes . Most had never acted before , though EX was CD major exception : Moisés Arias ( Bigfoot ) was a regular in Miley Cyrus ’s Disney series Hannah Montana . CD PRP saw on a tape playing basketball , a kid with a close crop , referred to on DT court as Matt , but in fact named Sofia ( Buenaventura ) . She plays Rambo in DT film and , says Landes , “ was very inspirational for DT fluidity of DT character ” . He calls DT character , who is written as male , “ post - gender ” . Researching DT film , Landes visited Colombian reinsertion camps , meeting adult rebel fighters who had laid down their guns and wanted to enter civil society . In CD he found Wilson Salazar , a man with dwarfism who became a child soldier at 11 and deserted when he was 24 . EX was a sizeable price on his head , dead or alive . “ He was very good at what he did , ” says Landes . “ He had risen to be part of a column called Teófilo Forero , CD of DT most feared combat units . He was an amazing destroyer of things . ” Landes hired Salazar as a military consultant , then asked him to play DT Messenger , too , as he was so convincing . At DT camp , Salazar woke his young charges at 4 am each day . PRP ’d undertake acting exercises in DT mornings , and in DT afternoons Salazar MD give them clandestine military training . “ PRP was intense , ” says Landes . “ PRP was a boot - camp scenario – DT kids were living , sleeping , eating together , everything together , all at DT same NN . ” Landes then selected his eight , tweaking DT screenplay to fit . DT shoot was yet more full - on . DT opening mountaintop segment was shot at almost 14,000 ft ( 4,300 m ) : punishingly cold and wet . “ PRP move slower up RB , ” says Landes . “ EX ’s low oxygen , PRP move in a bit of a daze . ” On DT first day , someone from DT camera department had an epileptic seizure . A baptism by fire , thought Landes ; things will VB easier . PRP did not . For four weeks , DT 55 - strong cast and crew filmed in DT jungle around DT Samaná river , five hours south - east of Medellín . Mules carried their food ; Colombia ’s national kayak team helped with filming on DT rapids ; a family of local gold miners built their military tents . EX was no electricity , no running NN , no refrigerated food and torrential downpours all night every night . EX were food rations . DT shoot took its toll . “ NNS were dropping IN flies , including me , ” says Landes . “ Everyone had their day . Everyone cried on this movie . PRP ’re working six - day weeks , very high - intensity scenarios . ” Landes himself was working seven - day weeks . CD morning he woke up and MD n’t move . DT gold miners put him on a stretcher and carried him up a canyon until PRP reached a local JJ centre . He cried on DT journey , distraught IN DT production might collapse . He was back behind DT camera 20 hours later . “ I VBP PRP was just DT stress , ” he says . “ And DT ration diet . ” PRP was worth PRP . DT film has earned universal raves – and a special prize in San Sebastián film festival , Spain , for accurately reflecting “ DT values and reality ” of LGBTQ NNS . DT story is a nightmare in which nothing – gender , sexuality , political allegiance – is muddled or irrelevant . “ PRP ’s not binary . DT ’s why I VBP PRP reaches much further than Colombia . DT is what ’s most timely and relevant . I wanted to make sure IN DT film spoke not to DT moment but to PRP as a species . ” • Monos is released in DT UK on 25 October"

DT respective ‘ army ’ of foot soldiers is now revealed as ‘ Contact Tracers ’ who will kickstart DT national panopticon grid of total surveillance . DT specific marketing propaganda to implement this is IN PRP “ will help PRP emerge from lockdown . ” PRP VBP to emerge from lockdown , do n’t PRP ? This subtle lever of coercion is to ensure JJ acceptance . Since each NN is responsible for their own surveillance programs , PRP is estimated IN collectively , EX will be a force of at least 300,000 such snitches . When PRP shows up at your door , PRP MD be well advised to tell them to VB lost and never come back . ⁃ TN Editor Contact Tracing ? Really ? DT ’s DT next big NN program to push for total surveillance over our lives . Now DT real fallout from DT Coronapocalypse comes to light . DT very NNS who created a fake pandemic out of faulty statistics , NN fear - pimping and DT rankest of propaganda are now pushing DT total surveillance NN to protect PRP ( them ? ) from DT next crisis . James Corbett from DT Corbett Report just published an excellent video discussing ‘ contact tracing ’ as promulgated by ( who else ? ) DT NNP NNP Initiative to create an army of JJ Brown Shirts to assist our wise and benevolent leaders in managing PRP IN livestock . James is urging PRP not to use their Orwellian term , and I agree with him . But DT best way to do DT is to make fun of PRP and them . I propose just looking at them and saying , “ Do n’t Trace Me , Bro . ” As always when PRP VBP to herd PRP towards a terrible idea PRP first have to come up with a harmless sounding euphemism for PRP . Either DT or just call PRP a war WDT PRP ’re VBG to fight and win together , PRP VBP , for kids ! But this was always DT plan with this NN . PRP can speculate as to why this has been done , why PRP was directed from DT commanding heights of our society but , in DT end , IN speculation is irrelevant . This is happening , PRP ’s here and PRP are now working to square DT circle . DT goal is to finish off DT last vestiges of anonymity and individuality started with DT destruction of financial privacy during DT NNP Adminstration , which was wrapped in DT classic NN phrases “ VB Your Customer ” and “ Anti-Money Laundering ” Now those sets of rules which got ramped up after 9/11 dominate DT JJ financial landscape . But , let ’s look at what ’s happened with NNP - CD step - by - step . First , a NN shows up in NNP which NNS in DT highest levels of our NN were briefed about as early as November , if Pepe Escobar ’s research is to be believed . DT gold standard remains DT ABC NNP report according to which intel collected in November 2019 by DT National Center for NNP Intelligence ( NCMI ) , a subsidiary of DT Pentagon ’s Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) , was already warning about a JJ virulent contagion getting out of hand in Wuhan , based on “ detailed analysis of intercepted communications and satellite imagery ” . An unnamed source told ABC , “ analysts concluded PRP MD be a cataclysmic event ” , adding DT intel was “ briefed multiple times ” to DT DIA , DT Pentagon ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff , and even DT White House . Next NNP , DT gold standard for DT Orwellian Panopticon , proceeds to use IN Panopticon to prove to DT NN how effective NN can be in containing a deadly plague . DT model , which runs fundamentally counter to billions of NNS of evolution and basid immunology , is then propagated around DT Western NN to combat NN - CD , a NN which has a mortality rate similar to DT annual NN , to shut down those economies exacerbating a financial crisis already fully underway . This destroys DT lives of hundreds of millions of NNS . PRP creates JJ dislocations WDT make DT Great Depression look IN a mild recession . In places IN Italy , France and Spain where youth unemployment has been in double digits for more than a decade , DT lock down was used as a way to tamp down social unrest , as PRP were hot beds for opposition to inept and increasingly fascistic governments . In DT U.S. , a country ruled by old , ideologically - possessed and corrupt Boomers who have been in a heightened NN of fear since Donald NNP was elected saw DT opportunity to create DT worst possible outcome in places IN NNP York and California . Governors in blue NNS seized power PRP did n’t legally have and cried for help PRP did n’t need . And DT confusion and disinformation about DT NN created so much fear NNS willingly huddled in their homes hoping DT angel of death passed them by with nothing more to do than be glued to DT death counter in a desperate bid to stay informed about DT NN . But EX were n’t two million dead in DT U.S. EX ’s around 50,000 and those death statistics are very speicous since DT NNS reporting them have motive , means and opportunity to inflate them to VB Federal aid , advance their political agendas now on full display and cover their asses . So , now ‘ contact tracing ’ which is just a euphemism for total surveillance . But PRP are admitting IN PRP ca n’t do PRP themselves . PRP need help . In totalitarian governments IN DT U.K. , PRP ’ll have an app in a couple of weeks . Matthew Gould RB disclosed plans to log DT location of whenever two or more NNS are in close proximity for minutes at a NN . Mr Gould told DT NNP and Technology Committee DT app MD be “ technically ready ” for deployment in “ two to three weeks ” – but made PRP clear PRP was only CD part of DT strategy to emerge from lockdown and MD involve a none - too - subtle marketing campaign . “ If PRP VBP to protect DT NHS and stop PRP being overwhelmed and , at DT same NN , VB to VB DT economy moving , then DT app is VBG to be part of an essential part of a strategy for doing DT , ” he VBD . NNP already has this . All across DT enlightened West NNS will now recruit tens of thousands of ‘ contact tracers ’ to VB out and build their network for them , just IN Gavin Newsome and Andrew Cuomo discussed with Bill NNP in DT video linked above . And since EX are now tens of millions of NNS out of work desperate for a job of any sort finding recruits will be easy . See how this works ? First PRP destroy NNS ’s lives , then PRP print trillions in funny money to bail out DT inept and continue paying DT enforcers , ensuring PRP are fed . And then when desperation reaches its peak PRP create a JJ NN program and turn NNS into snitches to ensure compliance . PRP ’re VBG to empower DT worst busybodies who are already insane with fear to run around collecting data for DT NN . All in DT name of getting DT economy back up and running ! I ’m pretty sure when I read DT Scarlet Letter in high school PRP did n’t consider Hester Prynne to be DT bad guy . Because DT person who is NNP - CD positive will now have a big red “ CV ” on them which will limit their ability to partake in society . DT next stage will be to force them to lock themselves down in isolation or face DT depredations of DT NNP . And even if PRP begin to ignore such insanity DT next step will be to look DT other way when DT contact tracers become belligerent . This is all about keeping everyone in a heightened NN of fear at all times . DT Karens will bee worried about a stupid germ and everyone else will be worried about what DT Karens will do . Because what good is this app if PRP does n’t report PRP to DT authorities who VBP where PRP are . So DT solution to a NN and DT incompetence of our governments is to turn busy bodies into brown shirts and NN positives into social pariahs . Do PRP realize what happens when PRP do n’t pay a parking ticket now ? Eventually your licence gets suspended , then your car insurance gets canceled . If PRP do n’t turn your tag in for not having insurance then PRP are risking jail NN when PRP VBP stopped by DT police . PRP arrest PRP for driving on a suspended licence , impound your car , and DT entire ordeal becomes a bureaucratic nightmare . DT moral of DT story ? Pay your parking ticket , obviously . But not because PRP were a bad person or committed a heinous crime . But because PRP broke DT rules . If PRP do n’t follow DT NNP ’s rules , no matter how petty , no matter how asinine PRP will be punished to DT full extent of DT law . Do PRP really VB this ‘ contact tracing ’ system wo n’t end up in DT same kind of hell ? Now PRP ’re a documented threat to other NNS ’s lives ! PRP ’re an evil spreader , man ! VB of DT NNS ! DT NNP is only good at two things . Killing NNS and creating perverse incentives . And if this is n’t a classic case of creating DT perverse incentive of destroying civilization in order to save PRP I do n’t VB what is ? This is DT real danger of 5G technology . PRP is n’t NNP having a backdoor embedded by Huawei , PRP is DT NNP having DT ability to blanket DT NN in high bandwidth snooping devices everywhere WDT NNS congregate . Their system is failing before our eyes . PRP ’s a system born of corrupt money begetting ever greater institutional corruption . PRP MD n’t be pushing for this total surveillance if PRP were n’t uniquely paranoid about our readiness to throw them overboard . PRP VBP PRP snitching on each other and suspect of each other . This is DT most pernicious form of social control ever devised , to distrust basic human contact and interaction because EX are germs in DT NN . PRP ’s NN to end DT mass hallucination WDT PRP ’ve never dealt with something IN this before . DT mass branding of this NN - CD as DT plague is laughable and DT push for JJ surveillance is pathetic . Unfortunately , PRP live in a NN today where DT fearful are empowered by DT powerful to mob DT non-compliant . NNP - CD is n’t DT plague folks . If PRP VBP PRP ’s DT crisis PRP should be fearful of I urge PRP to seek therapy not DT false security of a NN tracking app . Tom Luongo is DT publisher of DT Gold Goats n Guns . Ruminations on Geopolitics , Markets and Goats . PRP can actually participate in DT JJ efforts to cripple DT Deep NNP organized criminal cabal 's ability for genocide , while enjoying healthcare freedom at DT same NN , by boycotting Big Pharma for good ."

FBI Assistant Director Jay Cochran , who headed DT bureau 's lab division at DT NN , responded IN he was unable to find any records of such an examination , DT papers reveal .

"" PRP do not often come across hair which PRP are unable to identify and DT hair WDT PRP have now , about 15 hairs attached to a tiny piece of skin , is DT first WDT PRP have obtained in six NNS which PRP feel MD be of importance , "" Byrne wrote .

"" Researchers ' extensive DNA sequencing suggests IN DT legendary Sasquatch is a human relative WDT arose approximately 15,000 NNS ago . "" For her NN , Ketchum obtained three "" whole nuclear genomes from purported Sasquatch samples .

[ Infographic : Tracking Belief in Bigfoot ] So where 's DT evidence ? Well , EX is none . Not yet , anyway : Ketchum 's research has not appeared in any peer - reviewed scientific journal , and EX 's no indication when DT might happen . If DT data are good and DT NN is sound , any reputable NN journal MD jump at DT chance to be DT first to publish this groundbreaking information . Until then , Ketchum has refused to let anyone else see her evidence . Of course DT history of Bigfoot is rife with exaggerated and premature claims about proof of DT creature 's existence . For decades , various types of evidence have been offered as final , definitive proof , ranging from Bigfoot hair to blood to dead bodies . Without exception , DT evidence has always been hoaxed , misidentification or inconclusive . Because Ketchum has released no information at all about her findings ( nor have PRP been examined by outside experts ) , PRP 's impossible to evaluate DT validity of her conclusions . But an important clue can be found in her statement IN "" Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens . "" If DT mitochontrial DNA is identical to Homo sapiens ( i.e. , modern humans ) , then this suggests CD of two options . DT first , endorsed by Ketchum , is IN Bigfoot ancestors had sex with women about 15,000 NNS ago and created a half - human hybrid species currently hiding across North America . [ Rumor or Reality : DT Creatures of Cryptozoology ] EX is , however , another , simpler interpretation of such results : DT samples were contaminated . Whatever DT sample originally was — Bigfoot , bear , human or something else — PRP 's possible IN DT NNS who collected and handled DT specimens accidentally introduced their DNA into DT sample , which can easily occur with something as innocent as a spit , sneeze or cough . No NN outside of Ketchum 's team knows how this alleged Bigfoot DNA was collected , from where or by whom . PRP MD have been collected by DT NN 's top forensics experts , or by a pair of amateur Bigfoot buffs with no evidence - gathering training . How did DT team definitively determine IN DT samples were from a Bigfoot ? Did PRP take a blood or saliva sample from a living Bigfoot ? If so , how did PRP VB DT close , and why did n't PRP simply capture PRP or photograph PRP ? If DT samples were found in DT wild , how do PRP VB PRP was n't left by another animal — or possibly even a hunter , hiker or camper who left human genetic material ? Previous alleged Bigfoot samples subjected to DNA analysis have been deemed "" unknown "" or "" unidentified . "" However , "" unknown "" or "" unidentified "" results do not mean "" Bigfoot . "" EX are JJ reasons why a DNA sample might come back unknown , including IN PRP was contaminated or too degraded by environmental conditions . Or PRP MD simply mean IN DT animal PRP came from was not among DT reference samples WDT DT laboratory used for comparison . EX is no reference sample of Bigfoot DNA to compare PRP with , so by definition , EX can not be a conclusive match . Ketchum RB issued a statementrequesting IN DT U.S. NN immediately recognize Bigfoot as "" an indigenous NNS and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who MD see in their physical and cultural differences a ' license ' to hunt , trap , or kill them . "" Since no Bigfoot has ever been hunted , trapped or killed , PRP 's not clear IN DT creatures — if PRP exist — require any special federal protection . Ketchum's is not DT only genetics - based project intended to find Bigfoot . Earlier this NN , researchers from Oxford University and DT Lausanne Museum of Zoology announced PRP were collecting samples of alleged Bigfoot and Yeti hair for genetic identification . Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes collected materials from DT NN from NNP through September , and is currently conducting DNA analysis . Once DT results are in , he plans to submit his results to a peer - reviewed scientific journal . If Ketchum has DT definitive proof she claims , DT NN will soon VB about PRP , and Bigfoot will be proven once and for all . On DT other hand , if DT evidence never appears , or is inconclusive and flawed , DT search will continue .

PRP reveals how DT agency hacks into consumer products to turn them into spying devices … and how PRP can even remotely take control of cars . Entitled Vault 7 : CIA Hacking Tools Revealed , DT latest Wikileaks dump contains tons of documents explaining how DT CIA has hundreds of zero - day exploits ( holes in software WDT are unknown to DT vendor ) and can hack almost any smart tv , Android phone , iPhone , or router , and , apparently , recent cars as well . Not only DT , DT agency can even leave DT “ footprint ” of another entity while doing DT hacking , effectively allowing them to put DT blame on a foreign nation or organization . DT documents VBP : DT CIA , working with British spy agency MI5 , have developed a back door for a smart TV WDT allows NN snooping while DT television is turned off . And DT MD now include live video streaming of your living room and office . In a 2014 document detailing future and improvements to DT program , CIA officials VBD PRP planned to add a feature where DT Agency MD capture video and video snapshots of NNS through their televisions . This MD put DT federal NN and DT CIA right in your family room and office . Recently , DT CIA lost control of DT majority of its hacking arsenal including malware , viruses , trojans , weaponized “ zero day ” exploits , malware remote control systems and associated documentation . This extraordinary collection , which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code , gives its possessor DT entire hacking capacity of DT CIA . DT archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. NN hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner , CD of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of DT archive . According to DT documents , DT CIA has been using DT NNP Department consulate in Frankfurt Germany as a headquarters for hackers in Europe , DT Middle East , and Africa . DT organization has been collecting a library of attack techniques from malware produced in other NNS , including Russia . DT CIA has DT ability to use this library to misdirect attribution of hacks by leaving behind DT “ fingerprints ” of stolen malware . Probably DT most startling portion of this dump is DT revelation IN DT CIA has gained DT ability to “ hack ” into recent cars through their control systems . Note IN PRP are not even talking about self - driving cars ( which will certainly become 100 % CIA - remote - controlled ) , but regular cars with computerized components ( around 2011 and earlier ) . Why MD PRP VB to do DT ? To “ engage in nearly undetectable assassinations ” . These revelations shed a JJ light on DT very mysterious death of journalist Michael Hastings , who lost his life after his car suddenly went out of control and crashed . Hastings was a journalist , a contributing editor to Rolling Stone and reporter for BuzzFeed . He became a vocal critic of DT surveillance NN during DT investigation of reporters by DT U.S. Department of Justice in 2013 , referring to DT restrictions on DT freedom of DT press by DT Obama administration as a “ war ” on journalism . His last story , “ Why Democrats Love to Spy On Americans ” , was published by BuzzFeed on June 7 . Hastings died in a fiery high - speed automobile crash on June 18 , 2013 , in Los Angeles , California . On June 18 , 2013 , Hastings died in a single vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coupé at approximately 4:25 a.m. in DT Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles . A witness to DT crash VBD DT car seemed to be traveling at maximum speed and was creating sparks and flames before PRP fishtailed and crashed into a palm tree . Video from a nearby security camera purportedly shows Hastings ’ vehicle speeding and bursting into flames . Witnesses described DT car ’s engine being ejected 50 to 60 yards ( 46–55 m ) from DT scene . Hastings ’ body was burned beyond recognition . DT coroner identified DT body by matching fingerprints with those DT FBI had on file . Two days after DT crash , DT Los Angeles Police Department declared IN EX were no signs of foul play . DT coroner ’s report ruled DT death to be an accident . An autopsy showed IN DT cause of death was massive blunt force trauma consistent with a high - speed crash . – Los Angeles Times , “ Michael Hastings death : JJ video of crash emerges ” A NN article from 2015 actually mentioned IN Hasting ’s death was most IN DT result of a “ car cyber attack ” . Former U.S. National Coordinator for Security , Infrastructure Protection , and Counter - terrorism Richard A. Clarke VBD IN what is known about DT crash is “ consistent with a car cyber attack ” . He was quoted as saying “ EX is reason to believe IN intelligence agencies for major powers — including DT NNP NNPS — VBP how to remotely seize control of a car . So if EX were a cyber attack on [ Hastings ’ ] car — and I ’m not saying EX was , I VBP whoever did PRP MD probably VB away with PRP . ” “ Hastings ’ work as a thorn in DT side of NN and DT 33 - NN - old journalist ’s death in an unusual crash in June 2013 immediately triggered speculation . A witness reported seeing Hastings ’ JJ silver Mercedes C250 coupe speeding down a Hollywood street before dawn when PRP bounced , slammed into a tree and burst into flames . Shortly before Hastings ’ death , he sent what was described as a “ panicky ” email to friends expressing concern IN associates were being interviewed by “ DT Feds . ” He RB wrote IN he was onto a big story and needed to “ VB off DT radar for a bit . ” His 2010 story for Rolling Stone in which Stanley McChrystal skewered DT White House and its strategy in Afghanistan led to DT general ’s resignation . DT FBI denied Hastings was DT target of any investigation , yet a Freedom of Information Act request later unearthed an FBI file on Hastings . Hastings RB told a neighbor he thought someone had been tampering with his car . At DT NN of his death , he was working on an article about CIA director John Brennan . – Who . What . Why , “ CAR HACKING REPORT REFUELS CONCERNS ABOUT MICHAEL HASTINGS CRASH ” According to several sources , Hasting ’s last days very hectic . “ In an email to colleagues , which was copied to and released by Hastings ’ friend , Army Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs , Hastings VBD IN he was “ onto a big story ” , IN he needed to “ VB off DT radar ” , and IN DT FBI might interview them . WikiLeaks announced IN Hastings had RB contacted Jennifer Robinson , CD of its lawyers , a few hours prior to DT crash , and DT LA Weekly reported IN he was preparing JJ reports on DT CIA at DT NN of his death . His widow Elise Jordan VBD his final story was a profile of CIA Director John O. Brennan . DT FBI released a statement denying IN Hastings was being investigated . USA Today reported IN in DT days before his death , Hastings believed his car was being “ tampered with ” and IN he was scared and wanted to leave town . ‘ At 12:30 a.m. on DT morning he died , an agitated Michael Hastings went to his neighbor and friend Jordanna Thigpen and asked to borrow her car . He VBD he was afraid to drive his own car , because he believed IN someone had been tampering with PRP . “ He was scared , and he wanted to leave town , ” Thigpen recalls . But she declined , saying her car was having mechanical problems . When she woke up , Hastings was dead , his car having crashed into a tree . ’ Hastings died in a single vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coupé at approximately 4:25 a.m. in DT Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles . A witness to DT crash VBD DT car seemed to be traveling at maximum speed and was creating sparks and flames before PRP fishtailed and crashed into a palm tree .

Whatever DT size of your feet ( at any given NN ) PRP 's important to buy DT right shoes -- shoes WDT will fit correctly and offer your feet and ankles DT support PRP need . DT following suggestions will help PRP become a smart shoe shopper . Shop for shoes in DT late afternoon or evening , since DT 's when your feet are DT biggest ( PRP swell during DT day ) . Have DT salesperson measure both feet while PRP 're standing up , because your feet expand under DT weight of your body . Carefully consider DT fit and walking comfort of each pair of shoes PRP try and keep in mind IN "" size 8 "" in three different styles , even from DT same manufacturer , can fit your feet differently . If PRP have wide feet , always ask ( even if DT salesperson has measured your feet ) if DT style PRP 've chosen comes in a wide width . Fortunately , comfortable shoes have become popular -- even stylish -- and shoe manufacturers are waking up to DT fact IN not everyone has a medium - width foot . Some manufacturers make shoes as wide as triple - E ( on a scale of A to E , with AA being DT narrowest ) . EX are two other contributors to your shoe "" size "" as well : DT shape of your foot ( how DT shoe 's "" upper "" conforms to your foot ) and DT heel height WDT is best for PRP .

Geologists have been marveling at this giant foot print in rough granite , about 4 feet long . Some still say IN PRP is a natural erosion pattern , but for now PRP ’s hard to say . Prof. Pieter Wagener from UPE , suggests IN “ EX is a higher probability of little green men arriving from space and licking PRP out with their tongues , than being created by natural erosion . ” PRP is located in South Africa , near DT town of Mpaluzi , close to DT Swaziland border . PRP is estimated to be between 200 million and 3 Billion NNS old because of our current understanding of DT formation of granites in NNP ’s history . This dating immediately causes great debate and argument – so I urge PRP to keep your mind open and focused on DT evidence . This amazing footprint in granite was discovered in 1912 by a hunter called Stoffel Coetzee , while hunting in DT remote area . At DT NN this was a deeply remote part of South Africa known as DT Eastern Transvaal , teeming with wildlife , including antelope and lions . PRP remains in DT same condition as PRP was when first discovered and DT possibility IN this was a carved hoax is extremely low because of its remote location . Even today , PRP is difficult to find . DT real mystery is how this amazing phenomenon occurred – I have no idea – but here PRP is and PRP cannot wish PRP away . YES – PRP is granite – PRP is a well recognised geological part of South Africa and recorded on all geological maps – DT is why this footprint is such an incredible mystery . PRP can be described as a “ phenocrystic ” granite , OR coarse porphyritic granite , WDT underwent several different stages of cooling . DT result being an interesting mixture of large and small granules . This is why granite companies are keen to mine this area for granite because PRP will look really “ pretty ” when polished . In DT official Geology Of South Africa , this outcrop is called Mpuluzi Batholith ( Granite ) and DT official dating of this rock produced dates of around 3,1 billion NNS .

Professor Neil Ferguson , director of DT MRC Centre for NNP Infectious NNP Analysis at Imperial College , London , authored a report which forecast DT terrible death toll if nothing was done to stop DT spread of DT NN . Even plans to slow DT NN – letting around two - thirds of DT population catch NN to build up ‘ herd immunity ’ – MD result in 250,000 deaths , according to Imperial ’s mathematical model . Prof Ferguson ’s devastating conclusion led DT Prime Minister to perform a drastic U - turn a fortnight ago . Schools were closed and NNS told to stay at home . Last week , Prof Ferguson told MPs these measures MD see DT eventual death toll cut to ‘ substantially less ’ than 20,000 . Meanwhile a paper by separate colleagues at Imperial predicted just 5,700 deaths if DT lockdown continues . Now a rival academic has claimed Prof Ferguson has a patchy record of modelling epidemics , which MD have led to hasty Ministerial decisions . Professor Michael Thrusfield of Edinburgh University VBD Prof Ferguson was previously instrumental in modelling WDT led to DT cull of more than 6 million animals during DT foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 , which left rural Britain economically devastated . Then , Prof Ferguson and his Imperial colleagues concluded : ‘ Extensive culling is sadly DT only option for controlling DT current British epidemic . ’ But Prof Thrusfield , an expert in animal diseases , claimed DT model made incorrect assumptions about how foot and mouth NN was transmitted and , in a 2006 review , he claimed Imperial ’s foot and mouth model was ‘ not fit for purpose ’ , while in 2011 he VBD PRP was ‘ severely flawed ’ Read More : Imperial College Prof Neil Ferguson Accused Of ‘ Patchy Record Of Modeling Pandemics ’"

PRP was DT first documentary produced by DT National Geographic Society , and PRP made Jane Goodall a star . RB , a wife , and then , mother . She married van Lawick , and in 1967 gave birth to a son , Hugo Eric Louis , known as Grub . She is DT author of dozens of books on chimp and animal behavior , as well as on DT critical role of conservation . In 1977 , she founded DT Jane Goodall Institute , a nongovernmental organization devoted to protecting DT rapidly disappearing chimp habitat . In 1995 she was made a Commander of DT British Empire , and became Dame Jane Morris - Goodall , DBE . Born Valerie Jane Morris - Goodall in London in 1934 , her father , Mortimer , was a businessman ; her mother , Myfanwe ( Vanne ) Morris Goodall , was a novelist and looked after her family . DT expectations for Jane were standard issue for DT NN : a marriage to a nice , responsible man , followed by a few NNS . To her credit , her mother never discouraged her interests : animals , DT natural NN , and above all , DT wildlife of Africa . Once Vanne discovered IN little Jane had brought a handful of earthworms to bed ; rather than shrieking , she explained IN her JJ little friends needed DT soil to live , and together , PRP took them back to DT garden . Jane was a quiet girl , a bookworm who adored Doctor Dolittle and devoured DT Tarzan novels . Reading did its usual stealthy , life - changing thing : Jane developed a deep love of animals and a longing to VB to Africa and live among DT wild animals . But NNP War II was raging , and her family had little money . Instead of university , Jane enrolled in secretarial college , graduating in 1952 . Meanwhile , CD of Jane ’s school friends had moved to Kenya and invited her to come for a visit . Jane was working in London selecting music for advertising films at DT NN . In a move WDT seems so very right now , she moved home and worked as a waitress to finance DT trip . When she had saved enough , she quit her job and off she went . By which I mean she took an exciting , month - long journey from England , around DT Cape of Good Hope , to Mombasa , eventually making her way to Nairobi . RB she met Dr. Louis Leakey , DT great archaeologist and paleoanthropologist who traced our human origins to Africa . Leakey was charismatic , influential , and , at DT NN , a curator at Nairobi ’s natural history museum . He offered Jane a job RB , then invited her to come along on a dig at Olduvai Gorge . She spent three glorious months immersed in painstaking tasks : removing dirt from a fossil with a dental pick no bigger than your pinkie finger , or digging gently with a hunting knife . Leakey saw in her a person who was patient and thorough : CD who MD survive long stretches of isolation , who MD sit and watch and learn . In short , she was DT perfect candidate for his latest project — observing primates in DT wild — and when he asked whether she MD be interested in setting up camp at Gombe Stream on DT shores of remote Lake Tanganyika , she did n’t hesitate for a moment ."

Animal NNP has a show called “ Finding Bigfoot , ” with a guy looking IN he just cleaned out all DT pork rinds at DT Piggly Wiggly telling PRP he believes “ EX ’s a “ squatch ” in these woods … . ” “ Sasquatches DO exist , ” insists another sasquatch hunter , doing his best to look and sound serious , in DT show ’s accidentally comical commercial . PRP should n’t single out Animal NNP for scorn , however . DT channel does have silly company . DT History Channel has a show called UFO Hunters . NNP Green has a show called UFOs over NNP . These and other channels show Nostradamus programs more regularly than PRP show microscopes and telescopes combined . Against this backdrop , I suppose PRP should n’t be surprised by incessantly ridiculous claims and headlines about JJ NN . JJ NN causes earthquakes . JJ NN causes depression . JJ NN causes tsunamis . JJ NN causes wife beatings . JJ NN causes acne . JJ NN causes AIDS . JJ NN causes a greater likelihood of a UFO invasion . No , seriously , scientist - activists and their NN allies have alleged each of DT above , and then some . Just as microscopes and telescopes are glaringly missing on DT “ NN ” and “ history ” shows about sasquatches and UFOs , so too is DT Scientific Method glaringly missing from alarming JJ NN claims . “ JJ NN is a crisis because our computer models predict PRP will be . ” But your computer models predicted more NN for DT present than has actually occurred . ” “ Um , well , PRP have fixed DT . Really . ” Do n’t your billions of dollars of annual NN funding dry up if JJ NN turns out not to be a crisis ? “ Maybe , but PRP are guided by altruism and NN . ” Can PRP take a look at DT original data PRP used and can PRP examine your procedures ? “ Why should I show them to PRP when PRP will simply try to find something wrong with them ? ” Because DT is how NN works . Can PRP see them please ? “ No , DT MD violate my privacy rights and my academic freedom . ” Then why should PRP believe a JJ NN crisis truly exists ? I guess if such ridiculous circular logic passes for NNP Age NN and if such ridiculous alleged harms as acne , wife beatings and UFO invasions are presented as legitimate JJ NN crises , then why should PRP NOT have Bigfoot , UFOs and Nostradamus appearing front and center on NN and history programs . Did PRP hear about DT most recent NN ? JJ NN is causing mutant sharks . Two different shark subspecies appear to be breeding together in DT waters off DT coast of Australia . DT Australian blacktip shark and DT common blacktip shark seem to have been listening to Barry White music and getting their groove on together . Kind of IN wolves breeding with husky dogs or German shepherds breeding with golden retrievers . No big deal , really , except IN some clever rainmaker for NN grants has found a way to assert a connection with JJ NN . “ DT Australian blacktip is smaller and tends to live in warmer waters near northern and eastern Australia . Its globally distributed counterpart , DT common blacktip , is larger and favors cooler waters , ” explains DT Jan. 3 Christian NNP Monitor . Did PRP VB DT ? DT Australian blacktip shark lives in warm waters . DT common blacktip shark lives globally , in both warm and cool waters , but allegedly “ favors cooler waters . ” Therefore , if a few Australian blacktips and a few common blacktips VBP together and do DT wild thing , JJ NN must be DT reason . Now somebody please start shoveling some NN grants our way . By DT way , what type of scientific evidence supports DT asserted JJ NN connection ? Please allow me to quote DT Huffington Post : “ Lead researcher Jess Morgan VBD , ‘ If [ DT Australian blacktip ] hybridizes with DT common species PRP can effectively shift its range further south into cooler waters , so DT effect of this hybridizing is a range expansion . ’ ” OK , let ’s VB this straight . DT immensely intelligent and forward - thinking Australian blacktip shark knows IN humans are burning fossil fuels and have just failed to renew DT Kyoto Protocol . This MD seem to be good NN for DT warm NN - loving Australian blacktip . Nevertheless , DT Australian blacktip realizes IN too much of its favored warm NN might at some point in DT future become a bad thing . Therefore , DT Australian blacktips all got together and came up with a scheme to seduce unsuspecting common blacktip sharks so IN PRP can find a way to survive in COOLER waters . All of this , of course , is to adjust to anticipated future decades of human - caused JJ NN . Brilliant ! Absolutely brilliant !

DT process is VBG forward because of a court contestation WDT DT U of L Board of Governors lost due to its unwillingness to adhere to DT laws of labour relations in Alberta . Whose advice was DT Board depending on when its members put themselves in such an untenable position ? Before PRP have even started DT process WDT has come about because of DT determined stand of DT University of Lethbridge Faculty Association ( ULFA ) and DT Canadian Association of University Teachers ( CAUT ) , PRP , Premier Notley , chose to inject a politicized salvo into DT onslaught of vituperation against me WDT began on Aug. 26 of 2016 . Here is how DT University of Lethbridge Faculty Association described your ill - advised political intervention : DT Faculty Association wishes to express its disappointment in DT Premier ’s words . As DT union WDT represents Professor Hall in his employment relationship with DT University of Lethbridge , DT Faculty Association has endeavoured to have a fair and objective process employed for adjudicating Professor Hall ’s academic scholarship and accountability through procedures in DT collective agreement . PRP finally achieved this following significant effort and cost on our part and have a great deal of confidence in DT appropriate academic procedures to which Professor Hall is now subject . Having DT Premier draw conclusions about DT acceptability of Professor Hall ’s academic work prior to any decision rendered by an expert panel of qualified academics has DT potential to undermine this very process PRP have fought to achieve . At worse , though , these words have DT real potential to bias DT outcome of any such fair and objective process . DT Faculty Association has greatly appreciated DT hard work DT Premier and her NN have done to advance DT rights of post - secondary labour . PRP believe PRP is a dangerous precedent , however , for elected officials to intervene so directly in a complex labour matter such as this NN . CD of DT core points I intend to bring forward in my self - defense in DT forthcoming process , is to describe DT mounting of a negative NN campaign against me based on DT atrocious contents of a maliciously - engineered Facebook post . According to B’nai Brith Canada , DT core agency in orchestrating this NN deception , DT post appeared on , and then disappeared from , my Facebook wall during an interval of a few hours on Aug. 26 , 2016 . I did not invite this digital item onto my Facebook wall . I did not sanction its abhorrent contents . In fact I condemned DT post ’s contents publicly in mid-Sept . when I first became aware of DT digital item and DT way IN PRP was being deployed to destroy my reputation . PRP , Premier Notley , were presented with a deceptive account of my relationship to DT Facebook post long before I even knew about DT B’nai Brith Canada operation . Recently I learned from DT results of a FOIP investigation of DT Alberta Ministry of Justice IN on Aug. 27 , 2016 PRP and other Alberta cabinet ministers were sent a slanderous account of DT Facebook post as if PRP “ came from my lips . ” NNS in DT inner circle of your office reported PRP had seen DT communication WDT slanderously misrepresented me as an “ advocate for DT murder of Jews . ” If PRP MD actually take a genuine interest in my academic work , Premier Notley , PRP MD realize I have a record of studying all sorts of genocide and condemning this crime against humanity in all its manifestations , including DT Jewish Shoah . [ 2 ] Perhaps DT NNS who lied to PRP about me in late August of 2016 are still holding PRP captive in terms of filtering DT information WDT has caused PRP to VB whatever PRP is PRP believe PRP VBP about me . DT NNP of DT University of Lethbridge , Dr. Michael J. Mahon , went along with DT Facebook deception to suspend this tenured full professor on Oct. 3 and 4 , 2016 . I was pulled from DT classroom in mid-term and banned from stepping foot on campus . This purge took place entirely outside DT terms of DT collective agreement between DT university ’s faculty and administration . This suspension initially without pay essentially declared me guilty until proven innocent . Severe punitive measures were imposed on me all without even an ounce of adjudication by a neutral third - party . From DT correspondence I have been receiving from all over DT NN , I can say my suspension quickly became a shot heard throughout DT JJ academic realm , a shot signaling IN an Albertan university is leading an attack on DT institutions of tenure , peer review and academic freedom . Now PRP have joined in DT attack too Premier Notley . PRP have allied yourself with DT position of B’nai Brith Canada , DT organization WDT recently interfered in DT leadership race for DT JJ leader of DT federal NDP . DT same NNS WDT set in motion DT trial - by - NN aimed at me attacked DT NDP leadership candidate , Niki Ashton . According to B’nai Brith ’s CEO Michael Mostyn , Ms. Ashton ’s concern for DT violated human rights of Palestinians NNS made her “ an advocate for vile terrorists ” and “ convicted murders . ” PRP revealed Ms. Ashton ’s “ defective moral compass . ” [ 3 ] What is your view , Premier Notley , of DT condemnation directed at DT JJ NDP federal leader , Jagmeet Singh , when B’nai Brith Canada took aim at him for intervening to provide a venue at DT Ontario provincial legislature for a presentation by academic advocates of DT rights of educator Nadia Shoufani . DT condemnation came in late Augusts of 2016 when Mr. Singh was MLA for DT riding of Bramalea - Gore - Malton and Deputy Leader of DT Ontario NDP . At DT same NN as PRP was attacking Jagmeet Singh , B’nai Brith Canada was leading DT effort to have Ms. Shofani , a Canadian of Palestinian and Christian background , criminalized by police and fired from her teaching job in DT Dufferin - Peel Catholic School Board . DT criticisms directed at Ms. Shoufani are similar to those directed at Ms. Ashton . Similarly , DT effort to criminalize Ms. Shoufani and bar her from DT classroom anticipated DT similar treatment to which I was about to be subjected . DT attack on Ms. Shoufani ’s job and her reputation was based on allegations about her supposed “ terror - supporting remarks ” made in a Quds Day speech in Toronto in July of 2016 . [ 4 ] PRP seems , Premier Notley , your political intervention on DT wrong side of DT University of Lethbridge case reflects your reactionary alliance with DT thought police and speech police at B’nai Brith Canada . Your reactionary stance identifies PRP with DT backward policies of former NDP leader , Tom Mulcair , when he purged pro-Palestinian candidates from DT federal election of 2015 . This atrocious move was in all probably a significant factor in DT disappointing electoral showing of DT NDP as PRP lost its position of Canada ’s Official Opposition Party . [ 5 ] Now in Feb. of 2018 B’nai Brith Canada has resumed its efforts to quarterback DT NDP , lobbying aggressively to stop a resolution from being put on DT floor of DT recent NDP convention . DT vote , neverthess , was close , 189 for putting DT resolution forward and 200 for sidelining PRP . DT resolution included provisions on a Canadian boycott against products produced in DT illegal Israeli settlements in DT Occupied West Bank . Those supporting DT boycott resolution included DT unanimous support of DT Young NNP Democrats , 28 electoral riding associations covering six provinces and JJ current and former MPs . Geneviève Nevin , a supporter of DT resolution from Victoria , observed , “ EX ’s a generational divide on this issue . ” In his account of this divide within DT NDP , journalist Derrick O’Keefe suggested Jagmeet Singh MD be wise to look to DT example of Jeremy Corbyn in DT UK . Mr. Corbyn has mobilized on behalf of DT Labour Party considerable electoral support from his attentiveness to DT plight of Palestinian NNS under Israeli occupation . [ 6 ] By siding so strongly , Premier Notley , with DT U of L administration ’s collaboration with DT Isreal lobby including B’nai Brith Canada and DT Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs , PRP have identified yourself and your NN with agencies WDT condemned Hassan Diab wrongly as a terrorist . B’nai Brith Canada played a major role in calling for pulling DT sociology teacher from his Carleton University classroom in Ottawa . This intervention helped set in notion a miscarriage of justice WDT saw DT Lebanese Canadian academic incarcerated for a decade in Canada and France for a crime he did n’t commit . [ 7 ] PRP have identified yourself and your NN , Premier Notley , with notorious enemies of academic freedom who brought forward during DT 50th anniversary of York University all sorts of false allegations much IN those I am facing now . This fiasco unfolded when B’nai Brith Canada , DT CIJA , DT Canadian Jewish Congress and DT Jewish Defence League tried to shut down an academic conference on Israel / Palestine at York University in 2009 . DT effort to sabotage this academic initiative was foiled because DT York University NNP , Mamdou Shoukiri , and DT York University Board of Governors stood up for DT imperatives of academic freedom . [ 8 ] In 2018 in Alberta DT equation is very different . DT NNP and Board of University of Lethbridge have adopted DT position of DT Israel lobby . Now Premier Notley , PRP have intervened to strengthen this political coalition favouring DT stiffling of free and open debate at Alberta universities . Please consider revisiting PRP provocative and intellectually bankrupt position on this matter . [ 1 ] Chuck Millar ’s Letter to DT Alberta Premier — 11 January , 2018 at EX is no question IN DT views of this individual are repulsive , offensive and not reflective of Alberta . Our classrooms are a place for freedom of speech and expression but DT does not mean individuals VB to stand at DT head of DT class and spread lies and NN theories . I am terribly disappointed to learn IN this individual has been reinstated , but let me be clear IN legislation WDT our NN introduced did not give him his job back . I can confirm IN this individual is now under investigation by a committee at DT University . ” [ 2 ] See , for instance Hall , NNP into Property ” Colonization , Decolonization , and Capitalism ( Montreal : McGill - Queen ’s University Press , 2010 ) , Chapter 14 , “ Genocide and JJ Capitalism , ” pp. 655-711 [ 3 ] Tony Hall , “ Palestinians , B’nai Brith and Canada ’s NNP Democratic Party , Canadian Dimension , 30 July , 2017 at [ 5 ] Marion Kawas , “ NNP Democratic Party Purges Candidates over pro-Palestinian positions in lead up to Canadian elections , Mondoweiss , 24 Aug. , 2015 at [ 8 ] Susan G.

If DT political press was so overmatched then , VB of our financial press today which is no match for big - cap corporations IN Amazon , Facebook , Alphabet , even Apple . PRP avoid any discussion of pivotal variables in their future , research priorities or sector operating profit margins . PRP MD drive a bus through Amazon ’s forecast of upcoming revenues and earnings , but a bus full of analysts blindly forecasts numbers DT quarter - after - quarter wildly miss DT mark , not just for Amazon , but Apple , Facebook , Alphabet and Alibaba , too . DT negative press for these babies does n’t relent . Past Sunday ’s NNP York Times published a 16 - page special section called “ DT Decade Tech Lost Its Way . ” Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg , particularly , are cited for hurting democracy and spreading misinformation . Maybe yes , maybe no . Let ’s hope CNN keeps DT NNP administration fairly honest , day by day . Some background on DT NNP York Times : First , PRP ’s been a terrible investment these past 35 NNS while Rupert Murdoch took his NNP Corporation to DT moon . DT NYT ticked in DT twenties back in 1987 , presently $ 32.70 . PRP leveraged themselves to buy DT Boston Globe near DT peak for newspaper publishing valuation , completely missing DT nearly irrepressible surge in broadcasting , particularly subscription television . DT cardinal investment precept is never VB bogged down in basket NNS . I ’m reminded of my mother ’s experience with U.S. Steel which she bought in DT fifties because she thought PRP was a bargain with a good dividend . But , its price is down some 90 % since 1959 and its dividend was just cut to CD cent . Nothing good happened to U.S. Steel . PRP still makes plenty of steel but periodically shutters blast furnaces . Its market value is maybe $ 3 billion while Apple , Amazon and Alphabet trade near a trillion bucks , Facebook sits at a lousy $ 600 billion , but ready to break out . Consider , back in 1974 , basic industrials accounted for nearly 20 % of DT market ’s capitalized valuation . Today , PRP ’re under 5 % . Technology in 1974 , even after DT tremendous growth in semiconductors since early sixties , was as yet at 10 % of DT market . Technology , at 20 % of total sector weightings , seems headed much higher . Microsoft is ahead over 50 % from its 12 - month low while Apple is a double . Yes , up from $ 142 . For DT NYT to single out tech for losing its way this past decade does n’t do justice to these tremendous overachievers and what PRP ’s meant for our economy , DT stock market and DT country ’s primacy in internet and e-commerce sectors . Alibaba , I believe , is a sounder play than Amazon , but nobody takes away Jeff Bezos ’ achievement as a leading player , from scratch , in cloud computing . Alibaba ’s momentum in e-commerce prevails while Amazon as yet shows minimal margins in e-commerce . I see Alibaba developing its Ant Financial reach , particularly in money management , potentially a $ 500 billion business over five NNS , presently valued at $ 150 billion . When I look at Facebook , my focus is on operating cash flow and DT awesome reinvestment in research and development , near 20 % of revenues . With DT S&P 500 Index at 18 times forward 12 - month projections , a heady multiplier , Facebook sells around 20 times my projection of operating income and at 15 times next NN ’s operating cash flow . Stock is at 20 times my $ 10 a share earnings estimate for 2020 . MD PRP rather speculate in U.S. Steel with a penny dividend ( how foolish can PRP VB ) ? My point is Mark Zuckerberg has paid for his hubris . As a stock , Facebook was $ 80 some five NNS ago , but past two NNS scarcely gained 10 % . PRP is yet to take out DT old high of $ 220 set in 2018 . With a market capitalization around $ 600 billion PRP MD never catch Apple and Microsoft , but Microsoft is no longer a bargain and I can’t model Apple with any conviction . I ’m projecting Facebook ’s 2020 operating cash flow at $ 40 billion , a serious number . DT NNP York Times should send its financial reporters to night school for MBAs . Unless PRP deal with numbers , with a strong background in DT financial history of DT country , PRP ’ll make conclusions WDT are off - base and carry no weight or insight . Market capitalization of DT NYT sits around $ 10 billion , not exactly a Facebook in DT making , although PRP MD say PRP ’re both in DT same business , communications . But , DT Sulzbergers underplayed DT biggest , most lurid NN in NNP War II . Namely , DT destruction of millions of innocent Jews . Did their German Jewish origins VB in DT way ? Maybe . German Jews look down their noses , still , on Eastern - European Jewry . Ironically , JJ decades ago , I owned 15 % of DT NYT capitalization . I bought Saul Steinberg ’s block . Saul thought he MD break DT family trust on two classes of stock , but he MD n’t . Mike Milken brokered DT trade . I made some money and NNS later moved on with no regrets . Somehow , DT achievement scope of internet operators IN Facebook goes unregarded , even ignored . Journalists hone in on Zuckerberg , himself , because Zuck makes for racy copy . Nobody cares to mention DT Nasdaq 100 Index is ahead 45 % this NN . Yes , 45 % . DT magic of technological leverage plays on . Facebook logs awesome raw numbers . R&D runs at $ 14 billion annualized , up 30 % in DT September quarter , NN - over - NN . Earnings rate is approaching $ 25 billion annualized . Contrast all this with U.S. Steel ’s CD - penny dividend . EX ’s no leverage in earnings power for basic industrials . Apple , Alphabet , Facebook , Microsoft and Amazon comprise 20 % of DT market ’s valuation . Without their built - in buoyancy , DT market MD languish . General Electric will never be a great operator while Exxon Mobil is an RB - ran . General Motors ’ come back from death ’s door is notable but nobody cares much . DT NNP York Times remains DT “ Old Gray Lady ” while Facebook is IN Elvis Presley , swiveling his hips , kinetic footwork , belting out “ Hound Dog . ” Sosnoff and / or his managed accounts own : Facebook , Alibaba , Alphabet and Microsoft ."

DT report from Melba S. Ketchum RB suggests such cryptids had sex with modern human females WDT resulted in hairy hominin hybrids , but DT scientific community is dubious about her claim . "" A team of NNS can verify IN their five - NN - long DNA NN , currently under peer - review , confirms DT existence of a novel hominin hybrid species , commonly called ' Bigfoot ' or ' Sasquatch , ' living in North America , "" DT release reads . "" Researchers ' extensive DNA sequencing suggests IN DT legendary Sasquatch is a human relative WDT arose approximately 15,000 NNS ago . "" For her NN , Ketchum obtained three "" whole nuclear genomes from purported Sasquatch samples . DT genome sequencing shows IN Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens , but Sasquatch nuDNA is a novel , unknown hominin related to Homo sapiens and other primate species . "" ( Mitochondrial DNA , or mtDNA , is DT DNA WDT resides in DT cell 's NN - producing structures , and is typically passed down from mothers , while nuclear DNA , nuDNA , resides in DT cells ' nuclei and is passed down from both parents to offspring . ) "" Our data indicate IN DT North American Sasquatch is a hybrid species , DT result of males of an unknown hominin species crossing with female Homo sapiens , "" DT statement reads . [ Infographic : Tracking Belief in Bigfoot ] So where 's DT evidence ? Well , EX is none . Not yet , anyway : Ketchum 's research has not appeared in any peer - reviewed scientific journal , and EX 's no indication when DT might happen . If DT data are good and DT NN is sound , any reputable NN journal MD jump at DT chance to be DT first to publish this groundbreaking information . Until then , Ketchum has refused to let anyone else see her evidence . Of course DT history of Bigfoot is rife with exaggerated and premature claims about proof of DT creature 's existence . For decades , various types of evidence have been offered as final , definitive proof , ranging from Bigfoot hair to blood to dead bodies . Without exception , DT evidence has always been a hoax , misidentification or inconclusive . Because Ketchum has released no information at all about her findings ( nor have PRP been examined by outside experts ) , PRP 's impossible to evaluate DT validity of her conclusions . But an important clue can be found in her statement IN "" Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens . "" If DT mitochontrial DNA is identical to Homo sapiens ( i.e. , modern humans ) , then this suggests CD of two options . DT first , endorsed by Ketchum , is IN Bigfoot ancestors had sex with women about 15,000 NNS ago and created a half - human hybrid species currently hiding across North America . [ Rumor or Reality : DT Creatures of Cryptozoology ] EX is , however , another , simpler interpretation of such results : DT samples were contaminated . Whatever DT sample originally was — Bigfoot , bear , human or something else — PRP 's possible IN DT NNS who collected and handled DT specimens accidentally introduced their DNA into DT sample , which can easily occur with something as innocent as a spit , sneeze or cough . No NN outside of Ketchum 's team knows how this alleged Bigfoot DNA was collected , from where or by whom . PRP MD have been collected by DT NN 's top forensics experts , or by a pair of amateur Bigfoot buffs with no evidence - gathering training . • • All lightning on NNP MD have its roots in space , JJ research suggests . • How our brains can track a 100 mph pitch Confirming it's Bigfoot How did DT team definitively determine IN DT samples were from a Bigfoot ? Did PRP take a blood or saliva sample from a living Bigfoot ? If so , how did PRP VB DT close , and why did n't PRP simply capture PRP or photograph PRP ? If DT samples were found in DT wild , how do PRP VB PRP was n't left by another animal — or possibly even a hunter , hiker or camper who left human genetic material ? Previous alleged Bigfoot samples subjected to DNA analysis have been deemed "" unknown "" or "" unidentified . "" However , "" unknown "" or "" unidentified "" results do not mean "" Bigfoot . "" EX are JJ reasons why a DNA sample might come back unknown , including IN PRP was contaminated or too degraded by environmental conditions . Or PRP MD simply mean IN DT animal PRP came from was not among DT reference samples WDT DT laboratory used for comparison . EX is no reference sample of Bigfoot DNA to compare PRP with , so by definition , EX can not be a conclusive match . Ketchum RB issued a statement requesting IN DT U.S. NN immediately recognize Bigfoot as "" an indigenous NNS and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who MD see in their physical and cultural differences a ' license ' to hunt , trap , or kill them . "" Since no Bigfoot has ever been hunted , trapped or killed , PRP 's not clear IN DT creatures — if PRP exist — require any special federal protection . Ketchum's is not DT only genetics - based project intended to find Bigfoot . Earlier this NN , researchers from Oxford University and DT Lausanne Museum of Zoology announced PRP were collecting samples of alleged Bigfoot and Yeti hair for genetic identification . Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes collected materials from DT NN from NNP through September , and is currently conducting DNA analysis . Once DT results are in , he plans to submit his results to a peer - reviewed scientific journal . If Ketchum has DT definitive proof she claims , DT NN will soon VB about PRP , and Bigfoot will be proven once and for all . On DT other hand , if DT evidence never appears , or is inconclusive and flawed , DT search will continue .

"" Right now PRP 're treating PRP as a hoax , "" VBD Kevin Hill of DT NN Department of Wildlife and Fisheries . Despite DT likelihood of a hoax , Hill VBD , DT matter is still under investigation by DT DWF and Rapides Parish Sheriff 's Office . Meanwhile , DT two loggers -- log foreman Earl Whitstine and saw - cutter Carl Michael Dubois , both of Grant Parish -- are sticking tight to their story IN PRP saw a Bigfoot creature in DT Cotton Island area of northeast Rapides Parish last week . Their boss , Joe Delrie , owner of Delrie Wood Products of Colfax , says he believes their tale wholeheartedly , despite others ' skepticism about DT authenticity of DT alleged Bigfoot sightings and tracks found in Boggy Bayou . Mary Ward , DT owner of DT land where DT reported sightings took place , VBD around 200 NNS have come out to her property to view DT plaster cast taken from a "" Bigfoot "" footprint and DT Boggy Bayou site . "" PRP all VBP away pretty well convinced , "" Ward VBD . A sign put up over DT weekend at DT entrance to Ward 's property reads "" Big Foot Protection Area .

Whitstine VBD he saw DT unusual creature once on Tuesday morning and again on Thursday while working with Dubois . Whitstine and Dubois flatly deny PRP concocted a hoax , saying PRP had nothing to gain from such a ruse . "" Me and DT man ( Whitstine ) seen what PRP seen . PRP was big , hairy and had big feet , "" Dubois VBD . DT two men were working in DT Cotton Island area removing hardwood logs , PRP VBD , when DT creature made his two appearances . Whitstine 's father , R.C. Whitstine , admitted this week IN he was involved in a Bigfoot hoax more than 25 NNS ago . Earl Whitstine VBD IN he did not remember DT incident well , but did say he did n't believe his father was involved in DT hoax where "" Bigfoot "" tracks were discovered near Willianna . "" At DT NN , PRP VBD , ' Somebody IN R.C. MD do something IN DT , but he did n't do PRP , "" Earl Whitstine VBD . Earl Whitstine VBD his family trapped animals for extra holiday money and was in DT woods of Grant Parish often . He believes PRP was this fact IN his father was unfairly pegged as a Bigfoot hoaxer . But R.C. Whitstine , 76 , has admitted sawing a footprint out of plywood to make some tracks . "" PRP were just having some fun with a JJ saw , "" he told DT Town Talk . As for DT current rash of sightings , Earl Whitstine and Dubois say DT creature PRP saw in DT forest was about seven feet tall , covered in black hair and had big feet . Neither claimed PRP smelled a foul odor , but a fisherman who RB was VBN to have seen DT creature reported PRP smelled bad . Whitstine claimed he saw DT "" booger "" once on Tuesday morning while operating a tree cutter . He VBD DT sound of DT machine 's bucket startled DT creature , and PRP ran across a nearby creek and off into DT woods . "" After PRP jumped into DT NN , PRP looked back at me , "" Whitstine VBD . DT MD not be DT last of Bigfoot , he VBD . Two days later , DT two loggers were walking along a property line when PRP came across DT strange creature once again , PRP VBD . This NN PRP ran away when Whitstine called to PRP , PRP VBD . PRP was after DT sighting IN DT tracks were discovered in DT dry bayou . "" PRP can say PRP was a camel riding an elephant , but I saw what I saw , "" Whitstine VBD .

"" I ain't got nothing to hide , "" Dubois VBD . Delrie , owner of DT logging company , VBD Whitstine and Dubois are very trustworthy and honest men who do their job in a professional manner and have been with his company for a number of NNS . Delrie VBD IN when Whitstine told him about DT Tuesday sighting he believed him but had to have proof . PRP was after DT sighting on Thursday IN DT reality of DT situation sank in . "" Earl called me up and VBD , ' I need for PRP to come down here now , ' "" Delrie VBD . "" I noticed a NN in ( Whitstine 's ) voice .

Read_VB more_JJR about_IN Dr._NNP Al_NNP Sears_NNP research_NN here_RB","About 58 NNS ago , Eisenhower ended his presidency with his famous “ Farewell Address to DT Nation ” … A live broadcast where he warned of DT “ unwarranted influence sought by DT military - industrial complex ” – big defense firms who leveraged their political connections for profit . And who tapped their NN connections to manufacture enemies and crises – misleading DT America NN into CD war after another . Eisenhower ’s warning still rings true today – and DT dangers of America being dragged into JJ wars … for private profits … still exists . TLB Editors Note : What PRP are about to read MD put any modern day spy or thriller novel plot to shame … PRP is almost impossible to conceive … never mind believe . PRP are talking DT NNP of DT most powerful nation on DT NN vs DT most powerful JJ corporate cabal … No not DT Military Industrial Complex … Big Pharma . Most will never have heard or read what is being presented here . DT original article was published almost four NNS ago … its saving grace is its perspective of past events timed in generations , not decades or NNS ago . PRP will not bias what is presented here with our own views other than to say … PRP did feel PRP important enough to republish PRP . … but what is presented here stands on its own merit . But , in DT final 60 seconds of his farewell address – a segment previously censored until now … Ike issues an ominous SECOND warning … A warning most Americans never heard . DT footage of this final segment – and DT threat he warns of – has been kept under wraps . Hidden in DT archives of a NN building … And what PRP says was “ off - limits ” to DT American NN for about 58 NNS . But I ’m breaking this story wide open … naming DT big players … and broadcasting Ike ’s warning to DT NN . Even if DT powers - DT - be come and shut me down … Let DT chips fall where PRP MD … In this last minute – DT last NN Eisenhower MD EVER publicly speak – he warned Americans of a far more dangerous threat . CD WDT MD cost even more lives , and do even more damage to America . In fact , since Ike ’s final warning , PRP ’s secretly cost at least 950,000 lives each NN … Lives WDT MD have been easily saved … And as PRP ’re about to see , PRP MD even claim Eisenhower himself as its FIRST victim … But DT mainstream NN censored DT final 60 seconds of DT famous “ Farewell Address ” … PRP were actively complicit in DT “ cover up ” . I ’ve followed DT money trail to their doorsteps . And my research confirms DT NN now receives a whopping $ 27 billion per NN for keeping this story quiet . DT ’s why PRP ’s remained written out of DT textbooks … Banished from DT pages of history … Today I ’m blowing DT whistle on this secret plot . DT details of how PRP took Eisenhower ’s life . But first , let me introduce myself . For DT last 30 NNS I ’ve warned my readers about DT dangers of DT very threat Eisenhower warned of . DT threat of DT “ JJ industrial complex ” . A group of billion - dollar conglomerates who have literally bought entire departments of DT NN … Who manufacture deadly – and highly lucrative – drugs WDT cost millions of lives each NN . And who have assumed God - JJ control over America ’s healthcare system – and over YOUR life . PRP might VB them as Big Pharma or DT drug industry . But PRP just need to VB CD thing : PRP make $ 2 trillion each NN , money out of your pocket , for threatening your life , and DT of your family . And PRP ’ve risen to America ’s # 1 industry on a pile of dead bodies . About 58 NNS ago , NNP Eisenhower saw this coming … DT drug companies were just beginning to consolidate and grab market share during his presidency . And he tried to VB DT warning out to DT American NN – but DT NN ultimately blocked his efforts . DT ’s why few Americans remember this second warning . A plot WDT MD ultimately create their most lucrative industry . And PRP constructed a myth WDT MD aid in this 54 - NN propaganda campaign . PRP all began with DT DEATH of NNP Eisenhower . On September 24 , 1955 , NNP Eisenhower – NNP War II hero and beloved NN – was playing golf at his Denver home , when he suddenly collapsed from what was a rare NN at DT NN . Although nobody knew PRP then … and though PRP wo n’t read about PRP in any history book … This was a watershed moment WDT MD VB DT course of modern medicine forever . CD WDT MD make heart NN DT # 1 killer of Americans – and MD establish Big Pharma as America ’s # 1 most profitable industry . DT story I ’m unveiling today has HUGE implications for your personal NN , and DT of your family . If PRP or a loved NN has been diagnosed with heart NN , PRP need to VB DT exact details of what took place . Because this story does n’t just tell PRP WHO is responsible … PRP tells PRP WHY . • WHY heart NN rates have soared since 1955 – even as consumption of “ heart - healthy ” foods and cholesterol - lowering drugs has skyrocketed . • WHY PRP MD become victim of this drug - induced tragedy – no matter your cholesterol levels or intake of fat . • And 100 billion reasons why Big Pharma will cure heart NN . DT ’s why historian Larry Schweikart calls PRP “ DT single most important JJ case of DT twentieth century . ” Yet DT REAL story behind PRP is virtually unknown . Within 24 hours of Ike ’s heart attack , special interests seized DT opportunity . PRP shoved this propaganda down DT American NN ’s throat . And in doing so , PRP singlehandedly sent America ’s NN spiraling downhill for DT next six decades . Over DT next few minutes , I ’ll expose this near - 60 - NN - old Big Pharma NN . I ’ll name DT names . I ’ll track DT money . And at each stage , I ’ll answer DT BIG question : “ Who benefits ? ” What ’s more , I ’ll reveal how PRP can safeguard yourself from heart NN forever with solutions WDT are 100 percent natural , affordable , effective , and safe . But before I VBP into DT details of this story any further — how PRP spun off DT # 1 heart NN lie , ultimately claiming Eisenhower as its first victim — let me tell PRP about … Ike ’s other warning … A warning just as ominous for DT American NN , if not more so . Near DT end of his farewell address to America , Ike warned of DT “ scientific technological elite . ” These political and scientific insiders were : PRP were DT JJ foot soldiers of DT “ JJ - industrial complex . ” A small clique of career - obsessed bureaucrats only interested only in profits . Their research serves as a marketing tool for highly lucrative drugs . But PRP does nothing to improve JJ NN . Ike saw this development as DT end of scientific discovery and curiosity . PRP see , during NNP War II , while then - General Eisenhower was fighting for American freedoms … A small group of drug companies was working against our freedoms . PRP pulled their strings in NN . By DT Eisenhower era , DT drug industry was dominated by a handful of conglomerates . A cartel PRP VBP today as “ Big Pharma . ” And PRP were already leveraging control of scientific research for massive profits . Eisenhower undoubtedly saw this trend . As PRP ’re about to see , he even experienced DT results personally . So he knew this MD shape America ’s NN in DT decades ahead . But this part of Ike ’s address is all but ignored , censored , and “ off - DT - record . ” And DT ’s unfortunate , because PRP has mushroomed exponentially since DT address . NNS who support “ facts ” for Big Pharma ’s profit – and their own careers – are putting everyday Americans in imminent danger . DT ’s why PRP ’s imperative PRP heed Ike ’s warning if PRP ’re concerned about your own NN , and DT of your family . DT very first victory of this JJ “ scientific technological elite ” took place on September 24 , 1955 – within 24 hours of Ike ’s famous heart attack . PRP was … Even though 950,000 NNS still die every NN as a direct result … And although these deaths are easily preventable … I doubt CD in 10,000 Americans VBP about September 24 , 1955 . DT events on this dark day triggered a six - decade propaganda campaign – CD WDT ’s misled doctors and NNS to … • Focus on DT WRONG causes of heart NN … • And instead prescribe dangerous drugs WDT actually make heart problems worse , alongside 300 other deadly side effects . After Eisenhower ’s heart attack , Big Pharma kicked off their campaign of deception . Their JJ relations “ experts ” immediately appeared on TV and told America a frightening story . PRP claimed EX was a devastating JJ “ epidemic ” of heart NN . And PRP blamed excess fat and cholesterol in Americans ’ diets . To confront this “ crisis , ” PRP declared a JJ war . PRP labeled ALL fat as evil . Especially saturated fats . In turn , DT “ experts ” proposed radical changes to DT American way of life . PRP recommended IN Americans stop smoking . Engage in 30 minutes of cardio each day . And adopt DT “ Prudent Diet , ” a low - cholesterol diet consisting of corn oil , margarine , chicken , and cold cereal . What was their real agenda ? And who benefited ? According to DT Harvard School of NNP NNP … But in order to make their JJ agenda stick , PRP needed somebody famous as a model for everyday Americans . And who MD fit DT bill better than Eisenhower – war hero and beloved NN ? As PRP ’re about to see , PRP not only made Ike DT guinea pig for their hypothesis … PRP even used DT press coverage of Eisenhower ’s recovery as free advertising . Twice each day , for six months , DT press covered every aspect of Ike ’s recovery – every medicine and every dietary guideline . PRP instructed DT NN on DT dangers of coronary NN . For DT first NN DT word “ cholesterol ” entered DT JJ vocabulary . PRP portrayed cholesterol as DT “ JJ polio . ” Millions of Americans – frightened by DT JJ “ epidemic ” – quickly embraced any solutions DT so - called “ experts ” handed out . When DT dust settled , Americans had learned to watch DT fat and cholesterol in their diets . But EX was CD big problem with all of this … None of PRP was true . Not a single word of PRP . In fact , later research MD confirm these fats have plenty of proven NN benefits , including preventing and reversing heart NN ! But once “ facts ” IN these are born , PRP never seem to die . No matter DT research or studies WDT disprove them . Not when so much money is at stake . PRP see , this myth not only gave birth to poor dietary guidelines … PRP RB spawned DT most lucrative class of drugs ever invented . DT includes DT most lucrative ( and deadliest ) drug known to mankind . Sales to date from this drug alone have totaled a whopping $ 140 billion ! And this # 1 cash cow hinges on this CD single myth . DT ’s why PRP will NOT VB away so easily . Your own doctor likely still believes PRP . But I VBP PRP ’ll be surprised at just how little research EX is to back PRP . In a minute , PRP ’ll hear all DT details on how Ike was its first victim . But first , let me expose how PRP used Eisenhower ’s own doctor to administer their poison . Although top NNS and researchers were rallying behind DT JJ myth … EX was CD detractor : In fact , he publicly debunked PRP on a live broadcast in a panel debate with his peers . Even with NO JJ research , studies , or trials to support DT cholesterol hypothesis … Dr. White reversed his position , and jumped on DT bandwagon for DT sake of his own career . Is PRP a coincidence Eisenhower ’s own doctor was DT perfect example of DT “ scientific - technological elite ” ? I ’ll leave DT for PRP to decide . PRP see , this diet had POWERFUL backers from Big Pharma and Big Agriculture . IN Procter & Gamble , with billions of dollars on DT table selling vegetable oils in place of fat - heavy cooking . P&G ’s funding even helped transform DT American Heart Association into a powerhouse organization . In fact , DT AHA ’s most avid proponent of DT “ lipid theory , ” Fred Mattson , was a scientist ( and shill ) for Procter & Gamble . Mattson even helped P&G develop Olestra , a cholesterol - free replacement for fat in foods and cooking oils . And in 1958 , two NNS after Eisenhower ’s heart attack , Kraft introduced polyunsaturated margarine to DT market . A product PRP advertised as a “ heart healthy ” alternative to butter . With this kind of money at stake , DT increasingly powerful drug and food conglomerates were n’t taking any chances . DT ’s why PRP hired leading JJ experts to tout DT JJ party line . Today , drug companies STILL recruit “ key opinion leaders ” as hired guns for their marketing campaigns . These top physicians endorse Big Pharma ’s drugs . In return , PRP achieve celebrity status and popularity . And PRP enforce Big Pharma ’s ideas in DT JJ community . DT includes ostracizing and blacklisting doctors who buck DT status quo . These mouthpieces for Big Pharma embody DT very “ scientific technological elite ” WDT Eisenhower warned of . Dr. White emerged as CD of these leaders in DT 1950s . DT ’s why he MD not only VB along with DT JJ dogma … And aiding in DT corruption of JJ knowledge … But MD even turn around and prescribe this very same diet to Ike . Thanks to this single move , DT link between cholesterol and heart NN became “ gospel . ” Yet not a shred of research supported PRP . No studies , no trials , nothing . Americans swallowed DT propaganda IN an overpriced pill . Everyone now “ knew ” DT “ evils ” of fat and cholesterol in their diets . Ironically , Eisenhower ’s own condition – used by Big Pharma to push their agenda – 100 percent contradicted DT “ cholesterol myth . ” At DT NN of his heart attack , Eisenhower ’s cholesterol was ONLY 165 mg/dL . Ike RB exercised every day and kept a perfect weight of 172 . In other words , he seemed to be in perfect condition . And Ike ’s case was hardly unusual . According to a published analysis of DT Framingham Heart NNP … 75 percent of patients admitted to DT hospital for heart attacks have normal cholesterol levels . In short , cholesterol is a terrible predictor of heart NN . DT should have been DT lesson . DT end of DT story . But Americans did n’t hear about this from DT NN . All PRP heard was Eisenhower ’s JJ cholesterol - free diet . Ike replaced butter with hydrogenated soybean oils and margarine full of dangerous trans fat . He no longer ate eggs , bacon , and steak for breakfast . And over NN , at DT insistence of Dr. White , his diet regimen grew stricter . In fact , some days he MD eat nothing but grapefruit and melba toast . And as a result , Americans jumped on board DT JJ “ heart healthy ” diet fad . But this diet came with dire consequences for Ike ’s NN , mind , and body . DT same suffering millions of Americans MD experience over DT next 59 NNS . According to DT Harvard School of NNP NNP , back in DT 1960s when Americans consumed more fat , DT rate of obesity was 13 percent and only CD percent suffered from type 2 diabetes . Today , although PRP consume MUCH less fat in our diets , DT rate of obesity has soared as high as 45 percent and 8 percent now suffer from type 2 diabetes . This is from Harvard University – MD PRP VB of a more reliable source ? “ DT low - fat diet has n’t helped PRP control weight or become healthier . ” NNP Eisenhower ’s own experience is a case in point . After Ike began following this “ heart - healthy ” diet , his cholesterol levels soared . PRP jumped from 165 … to 195 … to 225 … to 259 mg/dL . DT NN grew increasingly frustrated , even obsessed with his cholesterol . At CD point he even checked his levels 10 times each NN . DT more his cholesterol soared , DT more religiously Ike stuck to DT diet . A fact WDT dumbfounded his team of top physicians and enraged DT NN . PRP got so bad DT NN ’s doctors even started lying to him about his real levels . Yet this did n’t stop DT “ experts ” from continuing to push this mythology . Six days before Ike ’s cholesterol level reached 259 , Ancel Keys – a protégé of Eisenhower ’s doctor – published his famous “ 7 NNS NN . ” In fact , Dr. Paul Dudley White helped Keys secure NN funding for DT NN . PRP championed DT same cholesterol - free diet WDT Eisenhower personally knew was false . And PRP established DT “ lipid hypothesis ” as accepted “ fact . ” But here ’s what no NN knew at DT NN : Ancel Keys “ cherry picked ” DT evidence so he MD associate heart NN with fat and cholesterol intake . Keys studied 22 NNS , but only focused on DT 6 NNS which supported his thesis . DT 16 other NNS actually disproved his entire idea … but he left them out . EX ’s a word for this kind of research – propaganda . Nevertheless , DT JJ NN rallied around his theory . Keys ended up on DT cover of NNP Magazine . Two weeks later , DT American Heart Association officially adopted DT cholesterol theory of heart NN . Pretty soon , PRP became DT accepted wisdom throughout DT JJ field . Lowering LDL ( “ bad ” ) cholesterol was now DT primary focus of preventive medicine . DT ironic part is , Eisenhower was experiencing firsthand just how wrong this theory was … and paying for PRP with his NN and life . Throughout DT 1960s , Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks and 14 myocardial infarctions … even as he stuck religiously to DT “ heart - healthy diet . ” In 1969 , DT famous war hero and beloved NN died from his last heart attack . In circles today , PRP ’s known as DT “ Eisenhower Paradox . ” And while this is only a single anecdotal piece of evidence … DT So - Called “ Eisenhower Paradox ” Is Killing Millions of Average Americans DT JJ establishment is still force - feeding PRP DT same myth WDT ultimately killed Eisenhower . Remember : DT conventional wisdom is IN LDL cholesterol causes arterial plaque buildup , ultimately obstructing our blood flow and leading to heart NN . PRP ’ve heard PRP . I heard PRP repeated from elementary to JJ school . And IN my colleagues , I believed PRP without question . DT is , until I read thousands of studies proving otherwise . Yes , LDL cholesterol can be found in DT plaque WDT builds up along damaged arteries . But this point misses a simple fact – CD even a high school physiology course MD tell PRP … DT damage to your arteries happens before NOT after DT plaque builds up . Plaque is your body ’s response to heart NN , not DT cause of PRP . LDL cholesterol catches blame because PRP ’s found at DT scene of DT crime . But DT ’s a lot IN blaming a scab for DT injury WDT caused PRP to form … or IN blaming a band - aid for DT injury its covering . DT truth is IN DT REAL culprit for heart NN has always been inflammation . And DT worst part is … DT inflammation in our blood vessels is caused in part by DT low - fat diet recommended for NNS by modern medicine . DT ’s why Eisenhower ’s heart NN grew worse , even on his “ heart - healthy ” diet … which replaced so - called “ artery - clogging ” butter with toxic vegetable oils . And DT ’s why 950,000 Americans continue to die each NN from heart NN , even as PRP consume record quantities of low - fat food , vegetable oils , and cholesterol - lowering drugs . In fact , DT truth about inflammation is old NN . But DT JJ establishment still ignores PRP . Even when DT mainstream NN occasionally gets PRP right . For instance , a 2004 NNP Magazine cover story identified inflammation as DT “ secret killer . ” Take a look at DT cover … DT NN article starts with a description of DT conventional explanation of heart NN . Then DT writer quickly shuts PRP down … . But I was stunned IN this blunt article actually reached DT mainstream . Of course , this was more than 10 NNS ago . And in spite of DT attention generated by this article , DT market for cholesterol - lowering drugs to counteract heart NN has skyrocketed five - fold since then . In short , EX ’s nothing stopping Big Pharma ’s relentless march for profits … no amount of evidence … no matter how airtight … even from a prestigious source IN NNP Magazine . Their profit margins VBP proof . And PRP certainly trumps your NN and your life . PRP do n’t have to fall victim to their mass guinea pig experiment . I ’ve identified three urgent indicators of heart NN PRP can check with a simple blood test . These tests indicate ( with startling accuracy ) IN PRP MD be at imminent risk of a heart attack or stroke . In fact , CD of these indicators can predict when DT risk MD jump by as much as 500 percent . A review of 26 articles , published in DT Journal of Biotechnology Information , proved even a very tiny increase in levels – 5 mcg – confirms a 20 percent increase in heart NN risk … independent of ANY other factors for heart NN . And I can speak from personal experience as a physician . Read more about Dr. Al Sears research here"

"" In this NN , PRP can even conclude IN DT lineages of orangutan and Gigantopithecus split up about 12 million NNS ago . "" DT researchers have worked out IN G. blacki likely weighed up to 595 pounds and diverged from orangutans around 12 million NNS ago . However , PRP 's not thought to be closely related to humans . DT NN 's lead author Frido Welker VBD : "" With this NN , PRP show IN PRP can use protein sequencing to retrieve ancient genetic information from primates living in subtropical areas even when DT fossil is two million NNS old . "" Until now , PRP has only been possible to retrieve genetic information from up to 10,000 - NN - old fossils in warm , humid areas . "" This is interesting , because ancient remains of DT supposed ancestors of our species , Homo sapiens , are RB mainly found in subtropical areas , particularly for DT early part of human evolution .

"" Fossils of DT ' original Bigfoot ' are very rare and only four parital jaws have ever been found . However , thousands of teeth have been discovered .

But armed with knowledge about our ancestors ' physical attributes and DT environment WDT surrounded them , NNS have come up with several theories . Anthropologist Henry McHenry , of DT University of California , Davis , for example , champions DT idea IN NN variation was part of DT picture after all . When Africa dried out , say McHenry and his colleague Peter Rodman , DT NN left patches of forest widely spaced between open savannah . DT first hominids lived mostly in these forest refuges but MD n't find enough food in any CD place . Learning to walk on two legs helped them travel long distances over ground to DT next woodsy patch , and thus to more food . Meave Leakey , head of paleontology at DT National Museums of Kenya and a member of DT NN 's most famous fossil - hunting family , suspects DT NN in NN rewarded bipedalism for a different reason . Yes , DT dryer NN made for more grassland , but our early ancestors , she argues , spent much of their NN not in dense forest or on DT savannah but in an environment with some trees , dense shrubbery and a bit of grass . "" And if PRP 're moving into more open country with grasslands and bushes and things IN this , and eating a lot of fruits and berries coming off low bushes , EX is a hell of an advantage to be able to reach higher . DT 's why DT gerenuk [ a type of antelope ] evolved its long neck and stands on its hind legs , and why DT giraffe evolved its long neck . EX 's strong pressure to be able to reach a wider range of levels . "" But for Kent NNP 's Lovejoy , DT real answer is sex . Males who were best at walking upright MD VB more of PRP , leading to more offspring who were good on two legs , who in turn got more sex . His reasoning , first proposed nearly two decades ago , goes IN this : IN JJ modern Americans , monkeys and apes of both genders work outside DT home -- in DT latter case , searching for food . Early humans , though , discovered DT Leave PRP to Beaver strategy : if males handled DT breadwinning , females MD stay closer to home and devote more NN to rearing DT NNS , thus giving them a better shot at growing up strong and healthy ."

DT excitement was spurred by DT Australian NN ’s recent release of a list of alleged Tasmanian tiger sightings from DT past three NNS . For Forrest Galante , this is an animal he has been thinking about for NNS . DT biologist turned adventurer is DT star of Animal NNP ’s Extinct or Alive , a nature show WDT seeks out animals WDT NN has proclaimed extinct . “ I spent three months in DT Australian bush looking for PRP , I have faith in DT animal ’s existence , ” Galante tells NNP . And even though those three months did n’t turn up a Tasmanian Tiger , RB known as a thylacine , he has n’t “ given up hope yet ” IN DT animal is out RB . Galante ’s opinion is CD to be trusted , he and DT Extinct or Alive crew have already uncovered species WDT DT NN literally left for dead , including DT rediscovery of DT Fernandina Giant Tortoise . “ PRP find CD of these animals and PRP ’s NN - shattering . PRP rewrites natural history , ” Galante says adding IN he sees each of Extinct or Alive ‘s rediscoveries as an “ accomplishment for DT NN of conservation . ” “ DT fact IN these animals are able to hang on by a thread when DT whole NN has given up on them — I am getting goosebumps , ” he says of DT feeling he gets holding an animal in his hands WDT DT NN thought was extinct . Galante , DT son of safari owners , has spent his whole life around wildlife and , after becoming a biologist , decided to share his excitement about his work through NN . This is how Extinct or Alive was born . DT show follows Galante through wild and remote locations in search of animals WDT are thought to be extinct . DT job is anything but guess work . Each episode consists of NNS of research , months of planning and weeks of field works . Galante says he receives at least 100 messages a week from fans and fellow animal lovers with tips , sightings and requests to search for certain animals , Big Foot included . And while Galante does n’t seek out cryptids IN Big Foot , he does read and log every message he gets , just in case any can bring him a step closer to uncovering an animal DT NN has forgotten . Even after all this work and preparation , EX are still plenty of trips when all DT effort does n’t lead to a rediscovery , but Galante does n’t consider these adventures to be failures . “ PRP make a very family friendly show . PRP do n’t always find DT animal , but PRP do find amazing habitats and other amazing species , ” he says . “ NNS can enjoy DT adventure and all DT beautiful creatures along DT way . ” Viewers can RB enjoy missing out on DT unique pains Galante and his team endure while out in DT field searching for extinct animals . According to Galante , while working on DT show , he has gotten used to getting 45 bee stings a day , been bitten by a shark , worked in 122 degree weather near an active volcano , spent days in darkness and gone into anaphylactic shock from a wasp sting . To him PRP is all worth PRP , but he understands if EX are NNS at home who prefer to assist in conservation in a different way . “ Conservation starts at home . Wildlife is all around PRP , ” Galante says . To those who are inspired by what he does , but are n’t looking for a shark bite , he advises joining a conservation group in your area , volunteering at a local rescue or donating to nonprofits WDT help protect our NN and its animals ."

Evidence suggests IN in some NNS NNP - CD presents itself on DT feet ; GPs are allegedly overrun with concerns about “ NN toe ” ; red blotches and lesions on DT toes and feet WDT are thought to be another side effect of DT NN . “ DT rash seems to resemble pernio erythema or chilblains and is presumably related to NN in body temperature , ” Dabbs says . “ Viral conditions often affect DT extremities and DT can include toes . ” Our isolated lifestyle is RB playing havoc with our feet . With gyms closed and JJ of our daily commutes cancelled , PRP are more static than usual , leaving PRP at risk of painful conditions such as Plantar fasciitis , which can stem from inactivity , Dabb says . Others , meanwhile , have become mad runners , haring off on DT 5 Km Run for Heroes with precious little training . According to Dabbs , extreme exercise without giving any thought to our feet can result in thickened skin , flattened arches , stress fractures and Achilles tendonitis . DT easiest way to start noticing our feet is to strip off our shoes and socks , says postural alignment therapist , Ellie Burt , and walk around on them . “ PRP ’s no good working out our bodies without thinking about our feet , ” she says . “ DT foot muscles might be tiny but PRP are crucial to a fully functioning , pain - free body ; some muscles such as DT Gastrocnemius start at DT foot and span all DT way up behind DT knee . ” This enforced rest from heeled work shoes is an ideal opportunity to give our feet a chance to recover and wake up , she continues . Heels and indeed any shoe including trainers WDT tilts our ankles downwards , throw off DT biomechanics of DT entire body , and load our feet unnaturally , causing problems in joints further up DT body . Do n’t be tempted to ditch your trainers entirely , though , warns Dabbs . If PRP ’re a perpetual heel wearer IN Meghan , PRP should gradually build up DT NN PRP spend barefoot or risk ending up with Achilles tendonitis . PRP ’s RB a good idea to introduce some barefoot exercises ; for those with flat feet , Dabbs ’ son James Dabbs , a personal trainer who runs online fitness classes to strengthen DT foot as well as DT rest of DT body , suggests introducing exercises WDT work on raising , strengthening and lengthening DT arches –stair arch raises , calf raises , arch lifts and tennis ball rolls . Pregnancy , ageing , footwear , gait and genetics can all contribute to flat feet , he says , but with regular exercise , PRP can strengthen your arches and reduce pain in other joints ."

DAMASCUS , SYRIA — DT NNP NNPS military has rejected offers to resolve DT growing humanitarian crisis in DT Rukban refugee camp in Syria , which sits inside a 55 km zone occupied by DT U.S. along DT Syria - Jordan border . DT U.S. has RB refused to let any of DT estimated 40,000 refugees — DT majority of which are women and NNS — leave DT camp voluntarily , even though NNS are dying in droves from lack of food , adequate shelter and JJ care . DT U.S. has RB not provided humanitarian aid to DT camp even though a U.S. military base is located just 20 km ( 12.4 miles ) away . DT growing desperation inside DT Rukban camp has received sparse NN coverage , likely because of DT U.S. ’ control over DT area in which DT camp is located . DT U.S. has been accused of refusing to let civilians leave DT area — even though nearly all have expressed a desire to either return to Syrian NN - held territory or seek refuge in neighboring NNS such as Turkey — because DT camp ’s presence helps to justify DT U.S. ’ illegal occupation of DT area . Though DT U.S. has long justified its presence in al - Tanf as necessary to defeat Daesh ( ISIS ) , DT U.S. NN has RB acknowledged IN al - Tanf ’s true strategic importance lies in U.S. efforts to “ contain ” Iran by blocking a connection from Iran to Syria through Iraq . Al - Tanf lies near DT area where DT borders of Syria , Iraq and Jordan meet . Thus , in DT U.S. ’ game of brinkmanship with Iran , Rukban ’s estimated 40,000 inhabitants have become pawns whose basic needs are ignored by their occupiers . U.S. shows no interest in meeting On Tuesday , delegations from Russia , Syria , DT UN , and DT Rukban refugee camp met to discuss DT fate of DT camp ’s inhabitants after a UN survey found IN 95 percent of DT camp ’s inhabitants wanted to leave DT camp , while 83 percent wanted to return to their hometowns in areas of Syria now under Syrian NN control . However , DT U.S. military and NNP Department officials in nearby Jordan rejected an invitation to Tuesday ’s meeting . DT U.S. military RB prohibited a Syrian - Russian delegation from entering DT Rukban camp on Tuesday . DT delegation had sought to assess conditions in DT camp , which have become increasingly desperate according to reports from a variety of outlets , including U.S. NN - funded outlets IN Voice of America . DT U.S. ’ refusal to attend DT meeting or allow DT delegation passage comes less than a month after DT U.S. military blocked DT entry of evacuation buses overseen by Russian and Syrian forces WDT MD have allowed refugees to leave DT camp . DT buses MD have entered through DT “ humanitarian corridors ” WDT were recently opened on DT Syrian - controlled side of DT U.S. - occupied enclave . While camp inhabitants can , in theory , leave DT camp through DT corridors on foot , DT barren area ’s remoteness makes such evacuations unfeasible without vehicle transport . Although some families have left this way , DT lack of record keeping within DT camp has made PRP impossible to VB how JJ have tried leaving this way since DT corridors were opened last month . An often overlooked problem WDT has prevented them from leaving is IN U.S. - backed and U.S. - trained “ moderate rebel ” groups have been known to block camp inhabitants from leaving , demanding large payments in U.S. dollars to leave DT area . DT U.S. military took control of Al - Tanf alongside “ moderate ” rebel forces in 2014 after wresting DT area from Daesh . JJ of those opposition groups have since been revealed to have ties and sympathies to terrorist groups , including Daesh . DT U.S. has not given a reason for its rejection of Tuesday ’s meeting and had previously VBN IN its rejection of DT evacuation buses was based on its view IN DT buses did not meet DT U.S. ’ “ protection standards . ” While DT U.S. has claimed IN PRP has blocked refugees from leaving on Russian - Syrian buses are under U.S. “ protection , ” PRP has done little to abet DT suffering of DT tens of thousands of civilians in Rukban , even though DT area is under complete U.S. military control and a U.S. military base is just a few miles away . Indeed , DT extent of U.S. “ aid ” to DT Rukban camp has been JJ training of DT handful of nurses in DT camp , who work in conditions PRP describe as being IN “ DT Stone Age ” owing to DT chronic lack of basic medications and doctors . While JJ care is decidedly lacking , DT most pressing problem is DT access to food , as starvation has become a real threat for those living in Rukban . Last October DT opposition - aligned NN service , DT Syrian Observatory for Human Rights ( SOHR ) , reported IN DT Rukban camp had been without food or essential supplies for months . Only two aid deliveries , managed jointly by DT Syrian Arab Red Crescent ( SARC ) and DT UN , were able to enter DT camp . CD of those shipments , however , almost did n’t happen after DT UN delayed DT aid “ for logistical and security reasons . ” While DT UN did not specify which “ security reasons ” had prompted DT delay , PRP was apparently not DT Syrian NN , as DT UN RB VBD in DT same statement IN DT convoy had received approval from Damascus . This suggests IN DT “ security ” concerns were related to U.S. - backed militants in DT U.S. - controlled area surrounding al - Tanf . Notably , Russian and Syrian sources have claimed IN these same militants often “ plunder ” DT aid intended for DT camp ’s inhabitants for themselves . Since then , DT situation inside DT camp has continued to deteriorate . Indeed , things have gotten so desperate IN , in January , a mother attempted to set herself and her three NNS on fire after she MD n’t find food for three straight days and preferred to give her NNS a quick death rather than watch them starve . Others in DT camp rescued DT family , though DT mother and her infant were seriously injured . Recently aid from DT UN and SARC arrived in early February , DT first aid shipment in over three months . DT lack of food combined with DT lack of JJ care has been responsible for scores of deaths in DT camp — DT majority of which are of NNS under DT age of two , who often die from malnutrition and preventable diseases . Others have died from freezing weather owing to a lack of adequate shelter , with eight NNS dying in January for DT very reason . Satellite images taken of DT camp in early March showed DT recent creation of a mass grave containing an estimated 300 bodies adjacent to DT camp . Despite DT desperate conditions less than 13 miles from its military base , DT U.S. has declined to send food , doctors , JJ supplies or other forms of aid to Rukban ’s inhabitants , while RB preventing them from leaving . However , DT U.S. has been providing militant groups in DT same area with military and logistical support . In addition to presiding over DT squalid and starvation conditions in DT Rukban camp , DT U.S. has RB given militant groups present in DT area PRP controls — including Daesh terrorists who have “ embedded ” themselves in DT camp on DT U.S. ’ watch — free rein to terrorize DT camp ’s refugees . These militant groups not only control DT flow of food and aid in DT camp but terrorize its most vulnerable inhabitants , forcing women and NNS into sex slavery and engaging in human trafficking . All of this is taking place in a “ deconfliction zone ” controlled by DT U.S. military . These extremist groups , including Daesh , are well - armed , according to Jordanian Brigadier General Sami Kafawin , who told NBC NNP in 2017 IN these groups “ have whole weapons systems … small arms , RPGs , anti-aircraft . ” DT official reason for DT U.S. base in al - Tanf has long been counterterrorism operations WDT ostensibly target Daesh . However , very few attacks against DT terror group have been launched from this base and a UN report released last August found IN Daesh had been given “ breathing space ” in U.S. - occupied areas of Syria , including al - Tanf . DT U.S. has stated IN PRP uses DT al - Tanf base to train Syrian opposition fighters who then control DT area around DT base , including Rukban . With DT U.S. now having claimed IN Daesh has been completely defeated in Syria , DT official justification for its illegal occupation of Syrian territory is wearing thin . With DT justification now on shaky ground , DT U.S. is increasingly having to acknowledge its main motive for its presence in al - Tanf — containing Iran and keeping Syria divided . Indeed , a recent Reuters article notes IN DT U.S. - controlled area around al - Tanf WDT includes DT Rukban camp “ is designed to shield U.S. troops at DT Tanf garrison and maintain for Washington a strategic foothold in an area close to a crucial supply route for Iranian weapons entering Syria from Iraq . ” This was confirmed by General Joseph Votel late last NN when he told NBC NNP IN DT U.S. base in al - Tanf was key in countering “ DT sway of Iran ” in Syria . This followed statements made last July by National Security Advisor John Bolton IN U.S. troops MD remain in Syria “ as long as DT Iranian menace continues throughout DT Middle East . ” This policy of Iran containment has clearly guided U.S. policy in Syria of late , with at least 1,000 U.S. troops set to stay in Syria illegally despite Daesh ’s defeat and NNP Donald NNP ’s recent calls for a troop withdrawal . DT U.S. has been accused of using DT civilians trapped in Rukban as a “ shield ” for its continued operations in Syria aimed at containing Iran ’s regional influence . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov VBD earlier this month IN “ DT fact IN NNS are not allowed to leave [ DT camp ] and are held hostage makes CD suggest IN DT U.S. needs this camp to continue justifying its illegitimate presence RB . ” EX appear to be few other explanations for DT U.S. ’ refusal to let camp inhabitants leave DT area . DT hypocrisy of U.S. “ humanitarian concerns ” DT situation in DT Rukban camp reveals DT dark reality behind DT U.S. ’ occupation of Syrian territory in Al - Tanf and elsewhere . In order to pursue its policy of Iran “ containment ” and a divided and partitioned Syria , DT U.S. is willing to imprison some 40,000 NNS — JJ of them NNS — in a concentration camp where international aid is blocked and where food is so scarce IN mothers are setting themselves and their NNS on fire so PRP can avoid slowly starving to death . According to DT Cambridge Dictionary , a concentration camp is defined as “ a place where large numbers of NNS are kept as prisoners in extremely bad conditions , especially for political reasons . ” PRP is undeniable IN DT Rukban camp fits this definition to DT letter . IN DT U.S. justifies its aggressive policies around DT NN — from Syria to Venezuela and elsewhere — as being motivated by “ humanitarian concerns ” — when a refugee camp under DT U.S. ’ complete control in Syria is facing starvation conditions and its inhabitants are being forcefully kept confined in DT camp by DT U.S. military despite their expressed desire to leave — is an obscene Orwellian twist . All this to “ contain ” Iranian influence in DT Middle East . Top photo | DT unofficial Rukban camp for displaced Syrians , between DT Jordan and Syria borders , Feb. 14 , 2017 .

[_-LRB- 13_CD ]_-RRB-","Finding Bigfoot is an American television series on Animal NNP . PRP premiered on NNP 29 , 2011 . DT program follows four researchers and explorers investigating potential evidence of Bigfoot , a cryptid hominid allegedly living in DT wildernesses of DT NNP NNPS and Canada . While DT Finding Bigfoot team never captured photographic evidence of DT creature 's existence , DT show gained high ratings and was a top earner for Animal NNP . DT series finale and DT 100th episode was released on NNP 27 , 2018 . DT team consists of Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization ( BFRO ) founder and NNP Matt Moneymaker , researchers James "" Bobo "" Fay and Cliff Barackman , and skeptical scientist Ranae Holland . DT series never questions DT existence of bigfoot , but rather documents DT team 's search efforts and NN of potential evidence in an attempt to prove DT existence of DT creature . Over DT course of DT series , DT team has introduced JJ JJ bigfoot related terms into DT American vernacular . For example , DT term "" bigfoot "" is rarely used in favor of "" squatch "" ( short for sasquatch ) . Their investigations are referred to as "" squatchin' "" . DT areas PRP investigate are often described as "" Squatchy "" , with Washington having been described as "" DT squatchiest NN . "" An episode begins with DT Finding Bigfoot team driving to a location on DT trail of photographic , video , audio , or eyewitness evidence of a Bigfoot . DT team will VB to DT location where DT evidence was gathered from , and speak to DT person who gathered DT evidence . If PRP is a photograph or a video , DT team will perform a recreation and a size comparison of DT event , using DT same camera WDT DT witness used . DT team then performs their first night investigation at DT same location . Starting with DT second season , CD member of DT team will almost always remain at DT location for a solo night investigation for several more nights . DT other three ( or four in DT first season ) members will then head to a ' town hall meeting ' to which members of DT NN are invited to come and share their Bigfoot encounter stories . In some heavily Bigfoot reported areas , such as Washington , these events are sometimes invite only . After DT witnesses tell their encounter stories , PRP are asked to mark their sighting locations on a map , which DT team then uses to look for a pattern of sightings . DT team will then visit three of DT best - reported encounters , WDT are usually close to CD another . After visiting all three witnesses , DT team will collect DT member who was doing DT solo night investigation and select an area to do their final night investigation . For DT final night investigation , DT team usually devises a unique plan to try to attract a Bigfoot , usually involving noise or light , by using boats on a lake , or silent electric ATVs . PRP RB do wood knocks , which mimics DT bigfoot 's supposed communication . Night - vision technology and forward looking infrared ( FLIR ) cameras are used to document these investigations . PRP will then evaluate what PRP learned and announce their evaluations during DT ending credits . Occasionally , PRP will show their trail cam pictures or DNA results following DT credits / summary . In DT third season , DT team expanded their search from North America to investigate DT Sasquatch phenomenon known as "" yowies "" in Australia . Later in DT season , PRP traveled to Indonesia searching for DT "" orang pendek "" , and to Vietnam to search for DT "" wildman "" . [ 7 ] In season four , DT team traveled to NNP in search of DT "" yeren "" , and Nepal in search of DT "" yeti "" . In later seasons , DT team traveled to other NNS , including DT NNP Kingdom and Brazil . Season 5 of Finding Bigfoot debuted on June 8 , 2014 , as opposed to November when DT last two seasons started . On October 20 , 2017 , DT Finding Bigfoot cast and crew revisited California to attend DT 50th anniversary festival while filming DT 100th episode of DT show . On NNP 27 , 2018 , DT 100th and finale episode was released on Animal NNP . PRP was entitled "" Return of DT Legend "" . Animal NNP has received criticism for Finding Bigfoot and Mermaids : DT Body Found [ 8 ] for their "" outlandishness "" , however , Fay is quick to defend Finding Bigfoot , and to draw a line between DT two programs . "" PRP ca n't equate bigfoot with mermaids . "" [ 9 ] Several episodes of DT first season received heavy criticism from DT four ' Finding Bigfoot ' members themselves , for DT editing style WDT Animal NNP used , to make PRP appear IN a horse and a person were unidentified by DT team , and what PRP were remained unknown . DT second event , involving DT horse , led DT team to threaten to quit DT show if such techniques were used again . [ 10 ] Regardless , Finding Bigfoot is CD of Animal NNP 's top rated programs . [ 11 ] PRP has spawned two spin- offs : Finding Bigfoot : Further Evidence and Finding Bigfoot : Rejected Evidence . Finding Bigfoot : Further Evidence is similar to VH - 1's Pop - Up Video . Episodes of Finding Bigfoot are re-aired with "" info nuggets "" from DT team members . Finding Bigfoot : Rejected Evidence is an online - only series , in which executive producer Keith Hoffman airs video deemed not worthy of inclusion on DT show . [ 12 ] Bigfoot enthusiasts have often ridiculed DT show , due to DT team 's consistent lack of success , and DT fact IN any footage of a Bigfoot MD be reported long before an episode airs . [ 13 ]"

I MD not move . With a feeling of utter degradation and terror I realized I was powerless to stop him possessing me -- as he MD often do in DT weeks , months and NNS WDT followed . "" ³Sounds IN Creighton was DT victim of a pedophile ? ² ³ IN Black Angel was probably Morton .² ³It 's possible IN some Section M agents MD have been mind controlled sex slaves .² ( From Makow , "" Martin Bormann Was a Rothschild Agent -- Damning Evidence "" ) Take a big jump . Creighton was dealing with international events WDT MD VB DT course of history . Those boys are very often body - jumped by Anubis . Anubis is DT original entity , around 5000 NNS old , first recorded pre-Egyptian around 32000 BC . Creighton clearly describes body - jumping : "" who possessed me . . . I MD not move . . . I was powerless to stop him possessing me . . . often do in DT weeks , months and NNS WDT followed . "" Whether PRP 're working on a good mission or a bad mission , Anubis appears as DT angle of death , as cold as space , heavy breathing , ultimately DT possessor , DT body - jumper . Ultimately Anubis appears to , and body - jumps , those who will VB NN events . He is not your séance dude . As for DT connection between "" Black Angel / Angel of Death / Anubis and victim of a pedophile / Morton / mind controlled sex slaves "" . . . PRP don¹t exist . Nor is Black Angel / Angel of Death / Anubis to be confused with Incubus or Succubus ­ getting young girls pregnant , and giving small boys blows . I¹ve just been on DT morphine for kidney stones , so I¹ll claim DT as cover . HALLETT'S EXPERIENCE I had similar training to Creighton / Ainsworth - Davis with DT Black Angel / Anubis . Mine RB started around 14 /15 . At 18 , while at University , I was fully body - jumped ( 1980 ) and by 1983 , I was body - jump capable . Some of DT horrific training occurs naturally under Anubis . DT most information inserted at DT deepest level in DT quickest NN is done through DT most intense fear . I call this ' internal terror¹ . DT five minutes I spent battling with Anubis over possession of my body was cover for an internal download . These downloads , which Creighton RB had , work on DT subconscious level . . . meaning PRP attract everything PRP need to achieve those goals . DT includes DT training , DT trainers , DT support crew , DT opportunities , DT job as cover , DT transport and accommodation and DT chance meetings . PRP RB means IN PRP can act as an independent and run your own constructs ( frame of reference ) . DT means PRP don¹t need to report back to a controller or ultimately rely on another crew . As PRP turned out , DT reconstruction of DT subconscious was CD of DT most valuable things to come out of DT Cold War . PRP was something PRP ultimately had delivered from Moscow . Just as Creighton¹s role was getting DT NNP into WWII with Pearl Harbor , and getting Bormann out of Berlin , my role , with similar experiences , was finishing Creighton / Ainsworth¹s story with DT escape of Hitler out of Berlin with DT attached Operation Winnie DT Pooh . . . and dropping DT Berlin Wall . MARKUS WOLFE Anubis is ' Man with Wolfe¹s head ' ­ hence Mark as Wolfe¹ ' Marcus Wolfe ' ­- DT head of DT STASI . He was very easy to body jump . Just look at DT photos of him around 21 -- very open . Anyway , PRP spent around a NN setting PRP up . I got into DT Ivy League CIA on DT reincarnation ticket in Boston and PRP took care of contacts , accommodation and transport . I made some KGB contacts and I was skipping between Checkpoint Charlie between DT two groups . Somehow PRP managed to arrange : 1 . A prostitute ( Russian ) ; 2. Lots of Alcohol ; 3 . Body - jump ; 4 . Construct , or Frame of reference . These are kind of IN secret formulasfor DT subconscious , IN DT parallel program , DT main program , thesabotage program and DT homeopathic program . These are DT sort of things I¹d explain to Carl Jung . Part of DT construct PRP used included me skippingthrough Checkpoint Charlie at exactly midnight DT NN before DT wall camedown , UH on 8/9 November 1988 . So a NN later , Marcus Wolfe tells his wife he¹s VBG out of town on abusiness trip for a week , but he stayed in Berlin with this JJ mistress andgets really drunk , standing around bragging in his underwear . His first wifewas RB his mistress , so he had a weakness here . He¹s been at PRP for a few days , and he¹s IN butter . There¹s some pressureat DT gates to open them for humans from East to West , so DT guard ringsup and asks for Marcus , then says , no , where Marcus is , not where he¹s not , at his relaxing place . DT guard gets put through to Marcus Wolfe and briefshim on DT situation , on DT pressure at DT gates and PRP discuss opening DT dog gates to VB DT dogs to scatter DT NNS . Marcus Wolfe goes back to drinking and ruling DT Berlin Wall in hisunderwear , then there¹s a NN of guard at DT Berlin Wall . DT JJ guard rings up and says to Marcus Wolfe : ³ EX is pressure at thegates² [ body - jump ] . Marcus Wolfe replies : ³ Open DT gates² [ body - jump ] . Marcus thinks he means DT dog gates . DT guard thinks he means DT humangates , so DT guard opens up DT Berlin Wall , and DT rest is history . . .. . . thank PRP very much . . . PRP RB did a whole lot of other stuff PRP didn¹t see . Some of PRP PRP bestdon¹t¹ see . Most of PRP , when mentioned , has to VB through DT whole longphase of ridicule before it¹s finally accepted . . . but PRP ¹re all livingin PRP . Marcus Wolfe was then announced as dying 17 NNS after DT Berlin Wall camedown on DT day . ¹ 17 NNS ¹ doesn¹t mean shit , but ¹ 18 NNS ¹ does . I tookthat as acknowledgment . At least , on this own , I can claim DT cover of Diclofenac , Doxazosin , Tramadol and morphine . . . Morpheus : "" Anyone for another construct ? "" PS : EX was only CD Ivy League CIA , in Greece , who managed to call me bymy correct handle . She got PRP straight up , straight away , did n't sayanything before . No intros . Straight down to business . PRP had some fun doingit . PRP 'll call her ' Catherine ' ."

DT examination included a NN of morphological characteristics such as root structure , medullary structure and cuticle thickness in addition to scale casts . RB DT hairs were compared directly with hairs of known origin under a comparison microscope . PRP was concluded as a result of these examinations WDT DT hairs are of deer family origin . DT hair sample PRP submitted is being returned as an enclosure to this letter , Curtis replied March 8 , thanking Cochran and saying he'd pass DT NN on to Byrne when DT monster hunter returned from Nepal .

DT country garnered $ 8.7 billion in venture funding last NN , according to Dealroom , DT data provider .

Case for DT pessimists : Just IN everything in divided Britain , not everyone agrees with this assessment , claiming IN lagging indicators IN venture money do n’t really tell PRP what ’s VBG on around DT country today . Instead , PRP point to a gradual fall in JJ techies showing up to work in DT country ’s digital ecosystem ( and DT ongoing development of rival hubs in Berlin and Paris ) as a telling ( leading ) indicator IN not all is well in DT NN of U.K. tech . What about DT politicians ? Glad PRP asked . Amid this techie stand - off , U.K. lawmakers are playing DT ‘ cake and eat PRP , too ’ strategy of both trying to woo NNS to DT local tech scene , while RB pushing ahead with some of DT most aggressive digital regulation anywhere in DT Western NN . Just IN a page out of DT Brexit playbook , few policymakers are yet willing to make tough decisions about how to handle DT future growth of London and DT rest of DT country ’s tech sector . DT ’s leaving JJ locals scratching their heads about how DT U.K. will continue to grow without proper leadership from those in Westminster .

She RB VBD IN 2,500 places MD be made available on artificial intelligence and data conversion courses starting in 2020 , and IN a panel of local techies MD write a NN on DT country 's tech competitiveness amid DT uncertainty caused by Brexit .

G20 AGREES , OR DOES PRP ? Over DT weekend , finance ministers from DT NN 's largest economies agreed to overhaul how DT likes of Google and Facebook pay taxes worldwide , a potential breakthrough in DT bitter debate about where these tech giants should pay tax . As part of DT proposals , which are expected to be finalized by DT end of next NN , NNS will now hammer out DT details , including potential divvying up DT rights to tax firms when their goods or services are sold locally , even if companies do n't have a physical presence nationally . If DT still does n't work , governments MD then be able to levy a JJ minimum tax rate . At first , PRP 's hard not to see this as a victory for France ( and DT NNP Kingdom ) , both NNS WDT have pushed ahead with their own local ( digital revenue ) taxes because of DT lack of a consensus , either across DT EU or globally . Speaking at DT G20 conference , France 's Bruno Le Maire VBD : "" PRP have a JJ JJ model based on digital activities and based on DT sale and exchange and use of massive data . ” But , but , but : DT NNP NNPS still remains opposed to such digital taxes , claiming IN PRP represent unfair taxation against its tech giants , whereas other NNS ' JJ firms ( IN Germany 's automakers ) VBP a free pass under DT proposed JJ regime . With more than a NN to VB before these rules are supposed to come into force , expect a heavy lobbying fight to either VB down DT digital tax proposals , or efforts to extend them to other parts of DT JJ economy ( where other NNS ' firms dominate ) .

UK ca n’t make up its mind on tech Digital Politics is a column about DT JJ intersection of technology and DT NN of politics . LONDON — EX 's a lot Britain can't agree on . Brexit . Who should be DT country 's next prime minister . Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of DT Labour Party . Add to DT list : What to do about tech . This week , London — still Europe 's tech capital despite DT ongoing political uncertainty — will play host to its annual "" tech week "" — part marketing ploy , part cheerleading fest to showcase what DT British capital , and DT rest of DT country , has to offer when PRP comes to glitzy startups , venture capital investment and NN support for DT digital economy . Yet in Westminster 's halls of power , DT hipster mecca of East London and DT well - heeled offices of Mayfair , two rival factions are bickering over DT NN of DT U.K.'s tech sector — and how PRP will fare once DT country eventually leaves DT European Union . On CD side are DT optimists , those who cite DT country 's record tech investment figures since PRP voted for Brexit in 2016 as a sign IN everything is VBG great . PRP dismiss DT current political impasse as a mere speed bump on DT road to DT U.K. putting tech at DT center of its future industrial strategy . On DT other side stand DT pessimists , who fret about DT gradual slowdown of highly educated ( European ) tech migrants rocking up to fill much - needed jobs in both startups and legacy tech companies . On top of DT , DT NN 's aggressive push to regulate DT industry — everything from proposed JJ digital taxes on Big Tech to greater policing of NNS 's social NN chatter — has raised eyebrows about its future support for local tech . DT stakes MD not be higher . DT U.K. NN has largely bet its JJ future on DT country 's burgeoning digital sector . And so far , PRP can't make up its mind whether to double down on its assistance for local firms and international giants IN Google and Facebook — be PRP through hundreds of millions of pounds of JJ funding or high - profile digital skills programs — or fall in line with politicians worldwide and DT growing "" techlash "" against all things digital . "" PRP really need to attract investment funds to make sure DT tech sector keeps growing , "" VBD Luca Schiavoni , a digital regulation analysts at Assembly Research , a consultancy firm in London . "" But at DT same NN , PRP 's really difficult to run into someone in Westminster who believes DT tech sector does n't need more regulation . "" Surely PRP does n't have to be a binary choice between pro-industry JJ policies and arguably CD of DT toughest regulatory clampdowns anywhere in DT Western NN ? But just IN DT other hot - button socio- JJ topics now confronting DT British NN , what to "" do "" about tech needs an answer . And PRP needs CD quickly . What 's muddying DT waters is how DT local tech scene has faired since DT 2016 Brexit referendum . Depending on whom PRP talk to , DT country 's digital economy is either full steam ahead or rocketing toward a cliff edge . Figures published on Monday by TechNation ( a quasi - NN entity ) paint a rosy picture , with U.K. venture capital investment last NN hitting $ 8.7 billion — easily outmatching France and Germany to claim top spot in European tech funding . DT number of U.K. startups worth at least $ 1 billion in 2018 RB reached 13 , more than all similar fledgling firms in Germany , Israel and Sweden combined . On top of DT , local lawmakers have earmarked hundreds of millions of additional funding through DT British Business Bank ( another quasi - NN institution ) to help local techies . Industry veterans — JJ of whom invested locally , so have skin in DT game to play up DT positives — RB highlight London 's continued ability to attract top talent as reasons why Westminster 's disjointed approach to DT sector should not be cause for concern . "" DT U.K. is not DT only country having a problem with politics , "" VBD Martin Mignot , a French partner at Index Ventures , a London - based fund whose investments include Transferwise , a successful local foreign currency exchange startup , and Net - A - Porter , DT British e-commerce giant . "" But once PRP 've got DT basics IN rule of law and functioning democracy , startups are n't VBG to do badly or well just because of DT political situation . "" Not everyone is so sanguine . While DT U.K. NN has increased DT number of visas for foreign nationals looking to start a tech ( or other ) business , JJ in industry are n't convinced IN DT current conveyor belt of international talent will continue when DT country finally leaves DT 28 - nation bloc . Britain has already lost its top spot among EU destinations as DT place to VB for DT region 's tech workers , according to data from LinkedIn . In 2017 , 14.9 percent of all Europe 's tech talent headed to DT U.K. in search of work , compared with 13.8 percent of workers traveling to Germany , DT second most popular country . But last NN , Germany pulled even with Britain , with both garnering 14.6 percent of all EU digital nomads , while France — championed by its NN , Emmanuel Macron — has done all WDT PRP can to knock DT U.K. off its perch as DT region 's top digital ecosystem . PRP 's not just talent WDT MD be drying up . A recent survey by KPMG and IHS Markit , two consultancies , shows IN JJ output from DT U.K.'s tech sector had begun to slow , though PRP 's still expanding each quarter at a faster rate than other sectors , and wages to attract and hold onto talent have skyrocketed , hurting businesses ' overall bottom lines . For Giles Derrington , associate director of policy at TechUK , a local trade body whose members include JJ giants IN Google and Apple as well as U.K. players IN chip designer ARM Holdings and Sage , DT digital accountancy provider , this uncertainty is making PRP harder for companies to justify future investment in Britain — particularly when DT chances of a no -deal Brexit are on DT rise . "" DT U.K. has always been an obvious center for investment into DT EU , "" he VBD . "" Now , DT 's a lot harder case to make for businesses . PRP do n't have a clear sense of what DT rule of law will look IN in DT U.K. for DT foreseeable future . """

A shrugging Bigfoot , with a black censored bar covering DT genitals , and Riggleman ’s face digitally superimposed on DT shoulders of another naked North American mythological creature . Over DT weekend , his political opponent in Democrat Leslie Cockburn tweeted DT images and accused Riggleman of being a “ devotee of Bigfoot erotica . ” Cockburn , a former investigative journalist , echoed other NN outlets when she tweeted IN Riggleman was “ caught on camera campaigning with a white supremacist , ” i.e. , Isaac Smith , co-founder of DT white - nationalist group Unity & Security , who appeared at a Riggleman ’s campaign stop in Virginia . “ This is not what PRP need on Capitol Hill , ” she tweeted . In an interview on Tuesday morning , Riggleman denied both allegations to Rolling Stone . He admits to researching , attending expeditions and writing about Bigfoot . But he ’s no Bigfoot fetishist , he says , but has a 14 - NN - old running joke with military friends , who send him these kind of images for his birthday . DT Charlottesville native RB denies any link to white supremacists — he claims Smith was “ just a kid ” who happened to be at CD of his campaign functions — bringing up a recent op - ed he wrote for DT Roanoke Times in which he slams white nationalism . Here , Riggleman ’s thoughts on Bigfoot , white supremacists and why he chose to prank is wife on their anniversary . PRP ’re trending on Twitter for being linked to Bigfoot erotica . Tell me about DT past few days . I never thought in a million NNS IN this MD happen . EX ’s not only been a lot of laughter , but a lot of bizarreness , too . Is your interest in Bigfoot a joke ? PRP ’s a 14 - NN - old practical joke hobby with a bunch of military buddies . How did PRP VB interested in Bigfoot ? Back in 1980 , my grandfather and I were walking on a spring line [ in West Virginia ] — which feeds cattle — and he VBD to stop for a second because he saw something in DT woods . He told me to run because he saw something mighty peculiar . I was 10 NNS old . I did n’t see anything . And where did your interest in Bigfoot VB from RB ? In 2004 , I told my wife I was VBG to take her on anniversary trip . When PRP landed in Seattle , Washington , she thought I was taking her to Hawaii . Instead I VBD , I thought PRP ’d be excited to VB to bigfoot expedition in Olympia Forest . DT made her angry . I pranked her . PRP went on a Bigfoot expedition . Then in 2005 and 2006 , my military buddies found out I [ co - writing DT book Bigfoot Exterminators , Inc : DT Partially Cautionary , Mostly True Tale of Monster Hunt 2006 . ] DT book was a prank . And PRP ’s since become a long - running joke with them . PRP ’re writing a JJ book , DT Mating Habits of Bigfoot and Why Women VBP Him . When do PRP plan on publishing ? My book is a political allegory . I ’d thought I ’d self publish PRP . To me , PRP ’s just hilarious . Now I ’m trying to figure out when to publish . I do n’t VB to take away from DT respect of DT office . I ’ll probably publish PRP after DT election . So do PRP believe in Bigfoot ? I do n’t believe in Bigfoot . I have n’t seen CD and I ’ve been on multiple expeditions . But I VBP PRP ’s DT great thing about being an American WDT anybody can believe what PRP VBP . What ’s your reaction to Cockburn ’s tweets ? PRP ’s CD of DT most insane tweets in political history . I do n’t VB if its desperation or what . I ’ve only been in DT race eight weeks . Maybe satire or humor or being a normal person is n’t part of a political process . PRP say EX ’s different belief systems in Bigfoot communities . How about politics ? NNS grab onto these belief systems and do n’t VB to look outside own boxes . In Bigfoot communities , PRP ’re arguing over mythological creatures . In politics , PRP see NNS arguing over myths . Why ca n’t PRP compromise ? Now PRP see NNS becoming so tribal , so wrapped up in histrionics , IN PRP ca n’t see through DT trees . In Bigfoot belief systems , EX ’s almost this challenge of trying to see other ’s point of views and now i see in [ DT ] politics today . PRP ’re VBG to see more NNS IN me run because PRP ’re tired of tribal mentality . In a tweet , Cockburn VBD IN PRP were on camera campaigning with a white supremacist . I ’ve been [ running for ] office [ for ] eight weeks . PRP tried to hook DT white supremacy stuff to my predecessor [ Republican incumbent Tom Garrett , who met with white nationalist leader Jason Kessler in 2017 ] . PRP do n’t VB what to do with me . I ’m not a white supremacist . I VBP she [ Cockburn ] panicked . I thought PRP was pretty crass . White supremacy is an important subject and to equate DT to Bigfoot seems to me to be irresponsible . Did PRP ever campaign with a white supremacist ? I ’ve never campaigned with a white supremacist . DT person PRP ’re talking about PRP was a kid standing by DT wall .

Since then , DT Cabalists were being limited in their WW3 thrust and were forced to recycle DT usual false flag operations which everybody has learned to dismiss as nothing but signs of subsyndromal symptomatic depression , or SSD , as most of these pseudo - Grand Chessboard players are already in their advanced age . But DT ISIS /L NN has already spread and even DT purveyors themselves are under threat due to massive influx of asylum seekers where ISIS/L terrorists MD embed themselves with when entering Europe and NNP . Nevertheless , DT Cabalists must pressed on with their occasional “ unintentional ” airdropping of military support to DT “ Free Syrian Rebels ” because dictator Assad must VB . Wait , Assad must stay , he ’s DT lesser evil now compared to DT rogue ISIS . Oh my , PRP ca n’t make up our own minds anymore … While these confusions are VBG on inside DT Cabal camp , DT supply of smuggled oil in DT black markets continue to flow . DT ISIS/L industry is a multi-billion cash cow for DT Cabalists . With only 30 % of Syrian land remaining under NN control , Russia has no choice but to deploy boots on DT ground which are now being joined in by Iranian foot soldiers , too . “ Qasem Soleimani , commander of Iran ’s elite Quds Force , has sent hundreds of ground soldiers into Syria in DT past few days apparently in cooperation with Russia ’s NNP Vladimir Putin , VBD a senior Israeli security official Thursday . Russia has RB recently deployed military assets into Syria and according to DT Israeli source , has teamed up with Iran in an unprecedented attempt to protect DT embattled regime of Bashar Assad from falling to rebel groups including DT Islamic NNP . DT Israeli source VBD IN Iran ’s increased military involvement in Syria was “ due to Assad ’s crisis and under Russian - Iranian cooperation as a result of a meeting between Soleimani with Russian NNP Vladimir Putin , ” VBD DT Israeli source . ” These series of events shocked Washington as DT other side of DT Atlantic compounded its Middle Eastern imminent defeat by electing a leftist , anti-NATO UK Labour Party leadership of Jeremy Corbyn . Add to DT is DT refusal of Greece to Obama ’s request to deny Russian humanitarian planes bound for Syria of its airspace . Near DT equator , PRP RB have Japan unable to sustain its economy supporting multiple anti-Russian JJ sanctions and is now planning to trade directly in Yen - Ruble denominations . Let PRP be understood IN DT plan to dismantle DT Syrian NN has been made decades earlier , and actual logistical and training support were already extended to DT Syrian opposition earlier than DT Arab Spring “ color revolutions ” . DT Iranians , having themselves survived several attempts to topple their own revolutionary NN , are now taking DT geopolitical and military offensives in what MD end up as DT final offensive against DT Cabalists in DT Middle East , in a grand prelude to DT elaborate launching of Manipulated Reality 2.0 by DT Vatican . DT Palestinian flag will RB be flying during this event , with DT NNP NNPS being pressured by DT Vatican to reopen its Cuban embassy and normalize diplomatic relations with DT country much earlier . EX ’s RB a move to relocate DT NNP Nations headquarters in a neutral country . Switzerland is VBN to be as neutral as DT Vatican . Finally , NNP is now more than ready to bring in DT Meltdown of DT Worst Kind to shut DT whole fiat economy down by bursting its own massive bubble . Of course , PRP can afford to do so with its massive gold hoardings , and so is Russia . Iran , for its part , is already anxious in welcoming JJ investments and reestablish trading with DT rest of DT NN once Western JJ sanctions are fully lifted as a direct result to DT successful conclusion of DT Iran Nuclear Deal with DT White House , not without DT holy prodding from DT Vatican , of course . DT Eurasian push for a saner NN is being underscored with a massive anti-NATO coordinated security forces in DT region . DT rest of DT population have RB been promised as worthy beneficiaries of DT first tranche of humanitarian packages amounting to NNP $ 1.7 trillion through DT Keenan Group .

"" He admitted , though , "" This is not exactly DT kind of thing I talk about at work . "" This part of East Texas , PRP turns out , is a hotspot of Bigfoot activity . "" DT Legend of Boggy Creek , "" which claimed to be based on real Bigfoot sightings , was filmed just an hour north of here . PRP terrified teenagers across DT country in 1972 . "" PRP was IN DT first movie I 'd seen in a theater where I felt UH , if I walked out of DT theater at night , I MD encounter DT screen monster I 'd seen , "" VBD David Coleman .

"" He 's a shared cultural icon "" - even if he 's not real . These days , "" America 's monster "" has inspired an avalanche of cable TV reality shows and testimonials on DT Internet . A whole army of Bigfoot hunters , IN Bill Brock , has taken to DT woods hoping to catch a glimpse of DT beast - or at least CD of his giant footprints . Future cryptozoologist Aiden Myers was enthralled by DT footprints casts : "" I never saw anything IN this ! "" Director Eduardo Sanchez ' first movie , "" DT Blair Witch Project , "" became an instant horror classic . Now he 's making a movie about Bigfoot . "" I VBP to see a Bigfoot so badly , I made a movie about PRP . "" For Sanchez and producer Mark Ordusky , Bigfoot has been a lifelong obsession . "" EX 's just something about PRP being just out of reach , not being able to see PRP , "" VBD Sanchez . "" PRP 's IN this quest . "" A quest , Ordusky added , "" WDT goes ever onward . "" Sanchez believes Bigfoot deserves more respect : "" Bigfoot 's been kind of a joke lately . PRP VBP , he 's in commercials , and even though I love DT humor , I 'm always thinking , ' Man , I wish somebody MD make a film WDT made Bigfoot scary again . ' "" For Loren Coleman , cryptozoology is serious NN . "" A lot of NNS MD VB to put PRP in some kind of category of pseudoscience , and PRP really reject DT , "" he VBD . He founded DT NN 's only Cryptozoology Museum , in Portland , Me . Its logo is a strange - looking fish called a Coelocanthe , thought to be extinct for 65 million NNS , until CD was found in 1938 . "" PRP 's a living fossil , "" VBD Coleman . "" And actually DT words ' living fossil ' was first associated with this fish . "" "" So , do PRP believe in Bigfoot ? "" Altschul asked . "" I 'm very careful about DT word ' belief . ' Belief is really DT providence of religion . As a scientist , as an investigative journalist , I 'm very much interested in looking at DT evidence , and accepting or denying DT . "" Loren showed Altschul a film taken in Bluff Creek , Calif. , on October 20th , 1967 ( "" This is DT gold standard , sort of DT Zapruder film of cryptozoology "" ) WDT has been analyzed by cryptozoologists using DT latest technology .

He was DT fourth tallest man to ever compete on DT WWE main roster and is now helping to bring through DT next generation of talents . And he MD now have helped unearth another duo of monsters who MD make PRP as big - LITERALLY . WWE confirmed DT NN this afternoon while announcing a trio of JJ recruits from India . A report on their website read : "" At 7 feet tall , 310 - pound Gurvinder Singh of Jagadhri is an experienced cricketer and actor WDT trained for DT squared circle under another giant of DT ring , DT Great Khali . "" Sukhwinder Grewal is another titanic trainee of Khali , standing 7 - foot - 2 and tipping DT scales at 340 lbs . DT 24 - NN - old played basketball before setting his sights on DT ring . "" And on DT third JJ arrival , WWE added : "" Twenty - five - NN - old Laxmi Kant Rajpoot comes to Orlando from Banda and has athletic experience in javelin throwing and taekwondo . "" Sun Sport reported last July IN a JJ giant was already around DT Performance Centre after DT humongous Jordan Omogbehin debuted at an NXT live show . And DT 7ft 3in colossus made quite DT impression as he dominated TWO OPPONENTS on his winning bow . Omogbehin was born in Lagos , Nigeria but played high school basketball in DT NNPS after moving to Virginia . After quitting DT court , DT towering behemoth was snapped up by NXT founder and wrestling legend Triple H for WWE . Despite his towering frame , Omogbehin is still only THIRD on DT all - NN list of tallest WWE superstars . Giant Gonzalez , real name Jorge Gonzalez and who had spells in both WCW and WWE , tops DT list . DT icon , who died in 2010 aged 44 , stood a ginormous EIGHT FEET TALL ! DT even dwarfed DT legendary late , great Andre ‘ DT Giant ’ – who was only a mere 7ft 4in in comparison . And DT Big Show is a baby compared to those big boys .

Sir Edmund Hillary and Tensing Norgay first accomplished DT feat in 1953 via Nepal ’s South Col , which remains CD of DT most common routes today . DT Nepali NN relies on DT tourism revenue generated by Everest , and in 2019 PRP issued a record 381 permits to climbers and a nearly equal number to local Sherpas , who set up DT camps and lead DT climbers up DT mountain . ( Here 's why DT NN 's most daunting mountains inspire PRP . ) Besides DT glory of standing on DT roof of DT NN , climbing Everest comes with a significant amount of controversy . Over DT NNS , DT large number of climbers and support staff have left massive amounts of trash and waste on DT mountain , though in recent NNS DT Nepali NN and private organisations have taken steps to clean up DT area around base camp . This NN critics cited DT large number of permits as a possible contributor to some of DT season 's 11 deaths on DT mountain . DT large number of NNS seeking to make DT summit combined with fewer windows of favourable weather created traffic jams on DT route to DT summit . ( Read more stories about adventurers on Mount Everest . ) Until conditions improve at Mount Everest , beat DT crowds and help preserve DT environment by looking to other epic climbs around DT NN . Here are nine of our favorites . In Mongolia , PRP ’s easy for a traveller to be quickly swept away by DT endless green steppes , DT heartiness of DT Kazakh nomads , and DT rolling landscapes WDT define DT Altai Mountains . This makes DT trek to Mount Khuiten as enjoyable and scenic as DT climb itself . DT mountain straddles DT corners of Russia , NNP , and Mongolia . To reach PRP , trekkers must cross a golden , vast , and barren landscape WDT is CD of DT last remote regions on NNP . This remarkable journey is enhanced by DT gentle hospitality of DT Kazakh nomads . Flat - topped Kilimanjaro is Africa ’s highest mountain . Located on Tanzania ’s northern border with Kenya , DT mountain is made up of three extinct volcanoes , Kibo , Mawenzi , and Shira . DT highest peak , Uhuru , is 19,340 feet high . Reaching DT top of Kilimanjaro is exhilarating . Take DT Machame Route up so PRP can see DT region ’s wonderful animals and birds . Then PRP ’ll begin DT trek across DT Shira Plateau through DT Grand Barranco Canyon and on to DT top . If all goes as planned , PRP ’ll reach Stella Point with a chance to continue around Kibo ’s rim to Uhuru . DT Inca Trail in Peru is an in - depth journey through a variety of ecosystems , from plains to desert to tropical cloud forests . PRP ’ll pass views of snowcapped mountains and rushing rivers . DT highlight is Machu Picchu , DT famed lost city of DT Inca WDT was discovered in 1911 by Hiram Bingham . Then continue your trek to what was DT heart and soul of DT Inca Empire , Cusco . ( Discover 10 secrets of Machu Picchu . ) Nestled in DT Swiss Alps , DT Matterhorn is DT most recognised mountain on DT European continent , and probably DT NN . In DT shape of a roughly chiseled rock pyramid , this peak serves as a defining geographical landmark . For JJ climbers , ascending DT Matterhorn , DT birthplace of DT sport of mountaineering , represents a return to DT purist traditions of climbing . Dynamic in both region and terrain , Russia 's Mount Elbrus stands as a watchtower in DT Caucasus Mountains between Europe and Asia . Elbrus is a large , double - coned volcano , whose summits vary by about 65 feet . For DT climber with moderate skills , DT highest mountain in Europe has great appeal because PRP presents a strenuous , yet rewarding climb . DT mountain ’s location affords visitors excellent opportunities to see DT region ’s large melting pot of ethnic groups , such as Turkish , Georgian , Azeri , and Russian . In DT heart of Mexico , about 800 miles south of DT NNP NNPS border , Citlaltépetl and Iztaccíhuatl are DT third and seventh highest mountains respectively in North America . DT first is 18,406 feet tall , while DT second is 17,159 feet tall . Ascents of these two volcanoes are by far DT most attractive climbs in Mexico . From a distance , PRP ’s easy to see how Iztaccíhuatl or “ white woman ” got its name ; DT snowcapped peaks look IN DT head , breasts , and feet of a sleeping woman ."

Foot_NN and_CC mouth_NN disease_NN )_-RRB-","As an independent Scientist and JJ researcher since 1994 , I have been working ( ) , on a completely JJ theory for circulation within humans , animals and plants . My discovery was initially in trees . In 1995 , I demonstrated DT JJ paradigm to Forestry Commission NNS and journalists , causing NN to flow up a single length of open ended tubing at a cliff in Brixham , Devon , to a height of 78 feet and demolished a three hundred NN old law of physics ( Torricelli ) . DT discovery is founded upon gravity and evaporation . Salts and sugars are concentrated as a result of evaporation , making DT fluids heavier , gravity draws DT heavy fluids down and DT less dense fluids are drawn up in a return flow ( for every action EX must be a reaction ) . Anything WDT interferes with evaporation ( damp / humidity ) , compromises circulation , when circulation within DT human body is compromised , PRP causes lethargy and affects feet and hands first ! Since 1994 , my efforts have been concentrated on helping NNS with debilitating illnesses by tilting DT bed in an inclined position , ( head raised 5 - 8 degrees to DT horizontal . Gravity has been shown to be significant in reversing neurological and non-neuro conditions , non-more compelling than DT recent Carlton TV NN coverage of a man walking , after ten NNS of paralysis due to a spinal cord injury . ( Reporter : Tim Iredale , Carlton TV NNP , Devon . ) This discovery is simple , true and repeatable and has DT most profound implications for DT benefit of mankind ! Yet , NNS , ministers , charities and most of DT JJ profession chose to ignore , what is after all basic , pure NN . How long can a scientific truth be ignored ? Once gravity is accepted as DT primary cause of circulation , PRP becomes clear to understand why foot and mouth NN affects DT flesh around DT hooves of grazing animals . PRP is not a coincidence IN hooves , tusks and even finger and toenails occur where PRP do . PRP are merely disposal sites for heavy substances , which arrive , where PRP do because of gravity ! PRP is no coincidence IN PRP , DT most vertical of all species , are DT most successful ! Gravity is evolution ! DT specific gravity of urine for instance was used to determine whether gravity driven circulation MD be taking place in humans and animals , In a similar process . For example respiration causes NN to evaporate from DT lungs and respiratory tract . Fluids remaining in DT body contain minerals and must therefore be concentrated by DT loss of mineral free NN ( evaporation ) . Gravity causes DT heavy solution to be drawn back through DT lining of DT lungs and respiratory tract and down through DT vessels in DT body , carrying dissolved oxygen with PRP . Concentrated solutions arrive at DT bladder via DT kidneys where PRP are excreted in DT urine . However DT kidneys are not 100 % efficient and some minerals arrive in DT lowest anatomical extremities , solidifying as finger and toenails or horses hooves etc . Clippings of which sink when dropped into NN . 5 degree to DT horizontal head down tilt over CD week decreased DT specific gravity of urine to a near zero reading . 5 degree to DT horizontal head up tilt over CD week significantly increased DT specific gravity of urine when compared to horizontal bedrest . Gravity does indeed play an important roll in renal function ! Toxins leave DT body more efficiently when DT human body is correctly aligned with DT direction of gravity . DT physiology of pig is very close to humans . So close in fact IN pig is now used to cultivate replacement organs for humans . PRP MD deduce IN JJ of todays illnesses affecting PRP MD RB be affecting pig and visa - versa . In fact almost all of DT drugs used in veterinary practice today have a human equivalent which in JJ NNS is identical to those prescribed to animals in all but DT name of DT drug . ( See Page 5 NN NN ) PRP is RB worth remembering IN JJ of these drugs have been tested on animals before entering DT £ multi-billion consumer marketplaces , which currently satisfies DT JJ and scientific industries . Towards DT end of DT NN 2000 , while driving past a pig farm on three occasions , I noticed IN DT animals were walking around ankle deep in NN , mud , urine and excrement . Due undoubtedly to DT excessive rainfall Britain was experiencing at DT NN and I remember thinking to myself IN these unfortunate animals were exposed to environmental factors WDT MD not be healthy to say DT least . If NNS were correct about DT physiological similarities between pigs and humans , then these pigs were in real trouble due to DT appalling weather conditions PRP were exposed to . Take a thousand NNS , strip them naked and leave them to face DT same elements and NN logged fields PRP have seen here in Britain for six months and see how JJ of PRP survive . Of course this MD be considered inhumane and MD never happen to humans , but PRP is happening !- all DT NN to pigs and other farm animals ? Remember IN long soak in DT bath or spending too long at DT swimming baths . Toes feet and fingers WDT looked IN PRP belonged to someone much older , all wrinkled and horrible . Soldiers on manoeuvres in tropical regions face foot rot due to DT wet and humid conditions . Jungle fever , leprosy , typhoid and JJ other diseases abound in such environments . Or do PRP ? MD PRP be IN DT adverse environment reduces our resistance to JJ of these illnesses ? Wet weather certainly affects our NN and is bore out by DT sudden increase in deaths among DT elderly every Autumn and Winter . Sudden Infant and adult deaths occur more frequently and influenza outbreaks , which have wiped out JJ thousands of NNS , are well documented . Aching arthritic joints , bronchitis , pleurisy , pneumonia , seasonal affective disorder , to mention a few , add more problems to our already over - stretched National NN services . Yet PRP do at least live in relatively comfortable homes when compared to DT pig , sheep or cow ! Every NN EX is a serious flood in DT developing NN , where NNS have less adequate accommodation , cholera outbreaks become a real problem ! Rotting bodies and DT carcasses of animals poison DT NN . However EX are a number of more unfortunate NNS who live on DT streets all over DT NN , including Britain . PRP is within this underclass of DT worlds poor NNS WDT serious illnesses abound , IN tuberculosis . Surely this must cement in place DT fact IN PRP , IN DT farm animals , cant survive DT harsh elements WDT DT weather places upon PRP unless PRP find a clean , warm and dry shelter ! In DT late Tudor Period , British history tells DT story of DT Sweating Sickness , which killed off JJ tens of thousands of NNS . Reference was made and documented as to DT unusually high humidity affecting Britain and Europe alike . Eventually , A tempest ( storm ) swept away DT illness and with PRP went DT humidity . Fortunately , living conditions for most have improved since DT Tudor period . DT weather in DT UK in DT NNS 2000 - 2001 has been DT wettest on record , JJ homes have been flooded NN and NN again . Yet little if any NN has been devoted to connecting DT foot and mouth outbreak this NN to DT environmental factors even though EX is documented evidence which supports DT fact IN humidity prolongs DT life of pathogenic infectious agents . ( Page6 : How is DT NN destroyed ? ) Leslie Monroe conducted a statistical analysis of incidence of sudden infant deaths ( SIDS ) His work now forms part of DT statistics collection shown on Open University Programmes . Leslie Monroe showed beyond any shadow of a doubt , IN living in low lying river valley areas , which suffered Winter Waterlogged soils had a much greater incidence of SIDS , up to 46 % above DT National average . I have spoken with Mr Monroe on several occasions and challenge anyone to find fault with his findings . Universities have -- and failed to find anything to DT contrary ! I conducted my own comparisons based on monthly rainfall plotted in a graph against monthly occurrences of SIDS from 1985 to 1992 . DT graph shows a double mirror image . Not only do DT peaks and troughs match convincingly , but RB DT general downward drift of rainfall from 1985 to 1992 , leading to a drought in DT winter of 1992 was followed by an almost identical decline in SIDS . MD PRP be DT humidity / damp in these areas WDT increases DT incidence of SIDS ? Yet in 1997 in DT months before and during DT last outbreak of foot and mouth NN , DT rainfall in Britain was again excessively wet and prolonged . Veterinary surgeon Hugh Peplow of Munnings Mitchell & Peplow remembers DT appalling weather conditions of 1967 Notable Features of DT Weather ( Monthly weather report .

DT 27th & 29th were wet in all districts . August : Cool and unsettled weather during first week . south - east mainly dry . Thundery outbreaks from DT 8th until DT 11th ended violently and with wide spread flooding , especially in Lancashire , where 75 mm of rain fell in 3 hours . North - westerly winds brought cooler weather to most districts on DT 12th , but from DT 14th to DT 18th EX was a good deal of rain . DT 19th to 28th was a generally warm dry period , although in some places remained cool because overnight fog was slow to clear . DT last three days were unsettled although south - east was mainly dry . DT first 5 days were generally unsettled , with frequent often severe gales . Prolonged rain , heavy at times , was broken by showery weather during DT afternoon of DT 2nd and during DT 4th Tiree recorded 75 mm of rain during this period . 10th & 11th were generally dull and wet days , other days being fine . 15th & 16th dull but mainly dry . 17th an area of rain moved across most districts and another during DT night of 18th / 19th , scattered thunderstorms on DT 20th and heavy showers on DT 21st were followed by a week of warmer weather and southerly winds , however rain was widespread on DT 24th , 25th and 29th . 30th sunny with scattered showers . October ( NNP of DT 1967 outbreak of FMD ) ( Source of local information for Oct : Vol 84 same report ) First 3 days were cool and stormy with widespread rain and gales , 4th bright and showery , but further rain reached south - west England from DT Atlantic on DT 5th . Mild south - westerly winds occurred on DT 6th spreading throughout DT country . A wet period followed , heavy rain on DT 8th 9th & 10th led to widespread floods in DT Lake District , south - west Scotland and north Wales . North Wales suffered considerable flood damage on DT 10th . Great Langdale ( Westmoorland ) recorded 146 mm in 24 hours . 11th Cooler westerly winds brought further rain and temperatures fell too near normal . 12th & 13th were sunny and dry for most of DT country . A wet day on DT 14th and Northerly winds brought a sharp drop in temperatures on DT 15th . DT 16th was DT stormiest day of DT month and heavy rains led to renewed widespread flooding in Wales and DT Midlands . DT days rainfall exceeded 50 mm in JJ parts of DT Midlands , 85 mm fell at Lwynon ( Brecknock ) . DT second half of DT month was changeable and rather wet . Gales were severe in places and continued on DT 17th from a north - westerly direction behind DT depression . Thundery showers spread to all districts in this cold north - westerly air - stream and snow was reported as far south as Ringway ( Manchester ) . Prolonged sunny periods on DT 18th & 22nd Temperatures were above average for DT week following DT 18th but DT last five days of DT month were rather cool with widespread rain on DT 19th 20th 27th and rain reached all districts late in DT day on DT 30th 31st widespread rain . DT unsettled , stormy and cold weather continued for most of DT first week . Rain was widespread and heavy locally on most days of this week . Rain reached northern districts on DT 24th and spread southwards over DT country bringing to an end 11 dry days at JJ places over Southern England . 27th - unsettled with rain alternating with brighter showery periods . Overnight fog was slow to disperse in DT Midlands during DT first two days . Rain spread South Eastwards across DT country on DT night of DT 2nd. 3rd mainly fine . North westerly winds reached gale force during DT next two days , and rain moving south . Followed by 5 days of cold Northerly winds which brought snow to all districts . Rain continued on DT 11th moving to DT south - east of England for most of DT 12th . Widespread rain on DT 15th followed by 4 days of cold weather with snow showers and night frosts . 21st to 27th saw milder wet weather , but DT 28th saw cold northerly winds with some snow until DT end of DT month . I have contacted DT Ministry Of Agriculture Fisheries and Food ( MAFF ) and DT National Farmers Union ( NFU ) and all I got in return was "" not now , this is DT wrong NN to consider your work in this field , come back when all of this has blown over . However , my wife heard on DT TV days after I had spoken to a veterinary surgeon at MAFF IN DT outbreak of foot and mouth will subside when DT weather changes for DT better ! Why DT mass slaughter of livestock and disruptions to DT farming and tourist industries if DT problem will resolve itself when DT rain stops ? ( page8 Persistence of NN Is slaughter really necessary ? PROPOSEL put to MAFF and DT NFU Confine a number of affected animals in a secure , clean containment room with dry bedding food and NN and room for exercise , use a dehumidifier to remove DT moisture from DT air to create a warm dry environment . VB DT effects of DT improved environmental conditions on DT affected animals for five weeks and see if PRP recover ! Having put my proposal to MAFF , which in my opinion MD be simple and cost effective to conduct . No further action looks imminent , instead DT mass slaughter continues , as if EX is some other hidden agenda behind PRP , perhaps to make sure IN DT future stocks on our farms are free from BSE ? Or simply to make use of DT surplus meat and dairy produce , which was given away to NNS in Britain a few NNS ago ?

CD official at least VBD IN he thought my arguments had some validity , fitting with JJ of DT known parameters in foot and mouth NN . He VBD IN PRP is thought IN DT summer months will eliminate DT NN and this is thought to be because of DT rays from DT sun and IN PRP should be investigated further ( Page8 : Persistence of NN ) . I pointed out IN my proposal did not involve DT sun and IN if successful MD prove this point . Foot and mouth should be seen as a warning of pending danger . published in their weekly NN INFORMATION of 28 NNP 1999 , Vol. 12 - No. 20 . ) By mid-December 1998 , DT NN had spread to Sikamat , about 60 km south of Kuala Lumpur , through movement of infected pigs . Seven of DT 20 workers developed DT NN and five died in January 1999 . By March 1999 DT NN had spread to DT major pig producing area of Bukit Pelandok in DT NNP of Negeri Sembilan DT NN spread to more farms and , from 1 March to 10 NNP 1999 , a total of 224 suspected NNS of viral encephalitis occurred in Negeri Sembilan with 80 fatalities . Out of a total of 258 persons suspected of being infected with DT Nipah NN , 100 have died . In a previously infected farm , more than 95 % of sows had Nipah NN antibodies . More than 90 % of DT piglets had antibodies assumed to be maternal antibodies . Antibody prevalence across all ages is currently being studied in an infected farm . END OF COPIED REPORT [ This is DT first comprehensive report PRP have seen and MD be DT first comprehensive report . Japanese encephalitis is no longer being reported as DT etiologic agent of Nipah NN and other steps forward obviously have been taken . DT overall mortality rate in humans is 38.8 % . JJ questions remain --- DT outlook for FMD in Great Britain 2001 is for a very large epidemic . PRP will grow fast in DT next few weeks and continue for JJ months . DT number of NNS will rise steeply with rapid expansion in DT existing areas in spite of current controls . Estimates vary from 70 NNS a day over DT next two weeks to over 4000 NNS by June 2001 . DT Ministry of Agriculture and DT Food Standards Agency held a joint meeting on 21 March to receive urgent advice from independent expert epidemiologists . Jim Scudamore ( Chief Veterinary Officer ) , Sir John Krebs ( Chairman FSA ) and Professor David King ( Chief Scientific Adviser ) heard reports from Neil Ferguson and colleagues ( Imperial College ) Mark Woolhouse ( University of Edinburgh ) and opinions from experts at DT Institute of Animal NNP and Veterinary Laboratories Agency . DT models and analysis use data recorded by MAFF up to CD March 2001 . A brief summary of DT available findings is attached ; Imperial plan to publish shortly . DT effect of controls on animal movement from 23 February was noted , but all DT experts advised DT need for further drastic action to bring NN under control . Otherwise FMD will become established in Britain . Speedier slaughter of infected animals will help to reduce transmission .

JJ of them lead lives WDT seem more befitting of rock stars than those of MBAs . Making millions is just CD benefit of a career WDT includes rubbing elbows with DT rich and famous . Making PRP big on Wall Street is something WDT JJ ambitious professionals set their sights on , especially when PRP 're fresh out of college . But do n't expect to find DT Wall Street job of your dreams in Sunday 's classified section of your local paper . DT most glamorous positions usually VBP unadvertised and require more hustle than resume , and more moxie than diploma . These positions are n't always handed out to DT boss 's nephew , either , but instead , to those willing to fight tooth - and - nail for a shot . If PRP 're up for DT challenge , here are four of Wall Street 's most glamorous jobs and what PRP takes to land them . Although PRP 's lost a little of its luster since DT burst of DT dotcom bubble and DT nosedive of DT financial markets in 2008 , investment banking is still CD of DT most tried - and - true routes to Wall Street riches . Those who have hit DT big NN can expect to be in DT middle of DT action when PRP comes to IPOs , mergers , acquisitions , corporate lending , institutional trading and other big - ticket Wall Street transactions . Entry - level investment banking associates do pretty well for themselves , often receiving salaries of $ 100,000 or more in their first NN . Within four to five NNS , seasoned investment bankers rising through DT ranks can easily earn $ 150,000 to $ 250,000 . If PRP 've got what PRP takes to stick around and land a key role in a huge deal , PRP MD easily walk away with a multimillion dollar paycheck . Sound IN DT right career for PRP ? If so , then prepare to pay your dues . After getting DT mandatory MBA from a top - tier business school , PRP can plan on moving to NNP York and working 80 to 100 hours per week as an analyst for DT first couple of NNS . Make sure to brush up on your accounting and networking skills , too because both are crucial for differentiating yourself from your competition and climbing through DT ranks . Stockbroker to DT Stars : Rubbing Elbows With America's Richest Only in America does an NBA all - star 's entourage include his stock broker . While DT MD seem a little extreme , EX MD be few NNS more important to an up - and - coming celebrity than an investment advisor and accountant . Because these celebrities receive large but intermittent paychecks and no guarantees of future employment , PRP 's key for them to manage their windfalls wisely . Is DT paycheck worth tolerating DT paparazzi ? PRP bet PRP is . On average , investment advisors to high net worth individuals earn about 1 % per NN on DT assets under their care . So , a broker who manages $ 5 million for 10 up - and - coming talents MD easily earn $ 500,000 per NN . Those numbers just keep increasing as your client list grows . Before PRP set your sights on becoming DT next Jerry Maguire of celebrity investing , PRP need to come to terms with CD fact : PRP 'll probably VB yelled at — a lot . Athletes , actors and aristocrats tend to be high - performance NNS who are used to getting their way . If PRP 're not living up to expectations , especially when PRP compare notes with their wealthy peers , PRP can bet PRP 'll hear about PRP . While a four - NN college degree is more than sufficient to VB PRP in DT door at JJ local branches of large Wall Street firms , be prepared to duke PRP out with every other ambitious broker trying to make a name for themselves . If PRP plan on being DT NN to land DT big - ticket clients , PRP 'll have to learn how to network your way through DT system of talent managers , lawyers and accountants . Because most celebrities have no interest in showing up at a Saturday morning investment workshop at your local brokerage branch , PRP rely heavily on referrals from their trusted circle of advisors . For some NNS , DT glory does n't come from closing DT big deal or hob - nobbing with DT elite , PRP comes from being DT best and from outperforming DT pack . For DT kind of glamour junky , EX 's no higher mountain to climb than managing billions of dollars in mutual fund assets . PRP 's DT Olympics of DT investing NN , where DT winners receive high ratings for their funds instead of gold medals . While DT days of a single investment guru managing a fund seem to be on DT decline , an entry - level position on a mutual fund management team can easily earn $ 200,000 to $ 400,000 per NN before bonuses . Climb DT ladder to become a senior team member or join CD of DT most prestigious mutual fund families , and pay can easily exceed $ 1 million dollars per NN . Be sure to tuck DT money away though — CD major mistake or bad investment call and EX 's a good chance PRP 'll never manage another fund again . If PRP feel IN PRP 're ready to VB behind DT wheel of a few billion dollars of other NNS 's nest eggs , PRP MD need to start in DT mailroom of your favorite mutual fund . PRP 's not uncommon to see newly minted chartered financial analysts ( CFAs ) fetching coffee for DT big guns , in between researching a couple hundred potential companies per week , of course . Mutual funds promote heavily from within their own ranks , most often favoring NNS who have proven PRP can work as part of a closely - knit team . If EX 's a brass ring for those seeking Wall Street glamour , PRP 's DT household recognition of becoming a NN personality . These are DT folks who are giving market commentaries on DT financial channels at DT end of DT day . PRP 're DT ones with DT absurdly lucrative TV , radio and book deals . PRP are DT NN - to NNS for millions of investors and VBP paid astronomical amounts for simply sharing their opinions . Considering IN folks IN Suze Orman and Jim Cramer can earn $ 10 million to $ 20 million in a bad NN , PRP 's not hard to see why Wall Street has become DT JJ Hollywood for NNS craving DT attention of a home viewing audience . But just IN all true celebrities , fame comes with a price . DT more visible DT person , DT more DT NN is interested in your personal life and unforgiving of your mistakes . If PRP VBP PRP 're ready for your close - up , PRP 've got two main options for getting your foot in DT door : First , PRP can VB your journalism degree and work on finding an entry - level position behind DT scenes at CD of DT major NN networks . IN JJ other Wall Street jobs , DT best positions are given to insiders who have paid their dues . PRP can plan on spending three to five NNS carrying cords and verifying sources before PRP VBP DT first shot at some airtime . Another option is to become a local expert , parlaying your Wall Street wisdom into recurring guest spots on local TV or radio channels . JJ of DT biggest names were once hometown favorites who eventually grabbed DT attention of CD of DT national morning shows . Wall Street is still DT greatest bastion of individual capitalism in DT NN and a place where determined individuals can work their way from answering DT phones to calling DT shots in just a matter of NNS . But DT reward does n't come easy , free or fairly . PRP wo n't find Wall Street glamour simply by working on Wall Street . PRP RB can't be attained through sheer luck , unless PRP choose to make your own . As DT famous Roman philosopher Seneca VBD , "" Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity . "" If Wall Street glamour is what PRP seek , never stop preparing for DT moment of opportunity , when PRP can step in and prove PRP 've got what PRP takes ."

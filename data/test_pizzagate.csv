592,"Official cover-ups of crimes that implicate the national-security establishment, as the Vegas massacre surely has done, must be handled with patience learned from prior investigative experience in order to spot disinformation and assemble credible evidence into a reconstruction of the totality of the crime, including the sequence of events, role of other participants, relationship to the government, background and motive.

 

 In pathetic contrast, the compliant news media portrays alleged gunman Stephen Paddock as a lone gunman and man of mystery without making an serious effort at uncovering his connections to the intelligence services, which happens to be the key to comprehending the reasons behind this puzzling mass murder. Then there is the planted single gunman claim like the FBI tip to Infowars that suspect Paddock was killed in the Bureau's assault and that antifa (anti-fascist, anti-racist anarchism) literature was found in the 32nd floor room at the Mandalay. (Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo countered that falsehood from the FBI by stating forthrightly that more than one shooter was involved.) Here it will be shown that Paddock was anything but a radical anarchist and instead worked as a contract agent for the Defense Department and CIA.

 

 The FBI-Las Vegas police feud was discussed at the 4chan thread, which was soon closed down for new comments: 

 

 According to a source in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department:: The LVMPD knows the motive behind the attack, but the FBI will not allow us to release the motive because it implicates the FBI in illegal arms deals and supplying arms to ISIS terrorists within U.S. borders. Stephen Paddock was an undercover FBI agent who participated in multiple illegal arms deals in the Las Vegas area in a gun-running entrapment scheme similar to Fast and Furious. Paddock thought he was engaging in another routine arms transfer, but ISIS had learned about the entrapment scheme and Paddocks true identity. They killed him and carried out the massacre, and then fled the scene.

 

 Everything is being kept under extreme wraps because 1) armed ISIS terrorists are still at large and 2) this is very embarrassing to the FBI and they dont want their scheme to become public knowledge. . . . People within LVMP are disgusted and are pushing for this information to be released to the public.

 

 Arguably more grotesque are the online snipers who falsely insist that the Vegas massacre never happened but was a stage-play faked by crisis actors. (There are crisis actors, but they are hired by public relations firms after a calamity to divert public attention from the actual trauma victims.)

 

 Citizen journalism defies online censorship and trolls

 

 In contrast to the paucity of information from the mainstream media, rense.com has posted eyewitness accounts and revelations from hotel staffers. Despite the shutdown of new comments under management pressure, the online boards reddit, 4chan and VOAT have done a fast and worthy job of separating out some nuggets of information from the chatter and planted disinfo. Unofficial citizen journalism has assembled the pieces needed for a cohesive picture of the alleged perpetrator and his connections with the intelligence establishment and to the radical Muslim ISIS.

 

 From these informal sources, three salient issues have surfaced:

 - indisputable evidence that a squad of multiple shooters were involved rather than just a lone gunman

 - the relocation of one of Paddocks airplanes between Virginia airports after an ATF agent was killed in the cover-up of Eric Holders Fast and Furious gun-peddling operation

 - the visits of Paddock and companion Marilou Danley to the UAE, Jordan and Israel while President Barack Obama was starting to turn against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

 

 Paddock as Agency Spy against ISIS

 

 Those morsels of vital information indicate that Paddock served for a long-time as contract agent for CIA-FBI gun-running and as a possible trained assassin.

 

 The Mandalay Bay affair was likely part of a covert program to transfer weapons from the vaults of the ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agency of Homeland Security), fitted with hidden RFID tracking chips, to ISIS militants inside the USA. Suspecting a sting operation, the ISIS team in Las Vegas shot him to death in his room at the Mandalay immediately before proceeding to fire at the crowd of revelers attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Sunday night, October 1.

 

 Police radio chatter and initial reports, especially in cases of politically sensitive crimes against public security, are often the most accurate, and therefore invariably followed by disinformation under a politicized cover-up. For an investigative journalist like myself, who led the probe into the Tokyo Subway gassing, consideration of early-on eyewitness reports and initial police comments is a rule of thumb. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) scanner (police-band radio) messages to and from the front-line cops is the indelible first draft, and what comes later is censorship.

 

 The earliest time-sequence report out of Vegas was posted at reddit under Gunshots Downtown Right Now? by Caram2, who was alerted to the gunfire by his sister, a employee at the MGM Grand who escaped the concert by running to the nearby airport. The timeline is fresher and more revealing than his post-event introduction, which already by then was influenced by Fox News knee-jerk response of a lone gunman narrative from the FBI.

 

 The comments below are his transcript from the LVMPD scanner. Here are a few notable excerpts of the salient points:

 

 (The first gunshots were at 10:08)

 10:11 Sister saying gunshots have slowed/stopped

 10:29 2-4 shooters - some officers pinned down

 10:38 Police say no shots fired 10-15 minutes

 10:47 Scanner says two scenes, injured personnel

 10:49 Reno and Trop(icana)

 (note: Reno Avenue East is the location of the Tropicana, Excalibur and New York New York Hotels)

 11:00 2 locations confirmed at Mandalay Bay and Ali Baba

 (note: Hendersons Ali Baba is a posh Lebanese restaurant.)

 11:05 Scanner says 3 shooters unconfirmed. Hacienda and Trop/Vegas?? Has bodies / shooters. Not sure when last shots were fired. Tropicana offramp is losed.

 (note: The Mandalay Bay is built on the site of the demolished Hacienda.

 11:06 Scanner says multiple 419s?? Scanner: do not worry about injured, Neutralize Threat.

 (note: 419 stands for Dead Body)

 11:17 Officers outside the alleged shooter room at the Mandalay. . . .

 11:18 NYNY shooter is heading to the Excalibur.

 (note: NYNY is the New York New York Hotel two blocks north on Las Vegas Boulevard S)

 1:34 Metro (police) press conference: 2 suspects dead/1 detained. One POC.

 (note - POC: police officer casualty? Or person of color?)

 

 Making Sense of the Chatter

 

 The sister, who was near the stage, escaped the gunfire after a truck tore down a section of fence and she managed to reach safety at the nearby airport. Her mobile calls from the scene and the airport indicated the firing had slowed within the first 3 minutes. Therefore most of 1,000-2,000 bullets were fired in that short space of time, while the revelers were trying to disperse or find cover.

 

 As part of the politicized gun-control debate, opponents of the Second Amendment have falsely claimed that a bump stock device (which uses recoil to re-engage the trigger) can enable a semiautomatic weapon, like the one found with Paddock, to fire 400 rounds per minute. This is a deliberate deceit, since 400 Rpm, take note here, is the rate of fire (as in highest firing rate during bursts) and not the number of bullets that can actually be shot within a minute. 400 shots would require 14 reloads and re-aiming, each requiring about 10 seconds, for a total down time of more than 2 minutes.

 

 The FBI photo taken in Paddocks hotel room showed a stack of curved AK-47 magazines, each holding 30 bullets; there was no bandolier-type machine-gun belt in sight. Therefore, the lone gunman narrative is preposterous, and anyone who put this sort of nonsense forward, especially from law enforcement, is a knowing liar. For that reason alone, the bump stock ban proposed in Congress should be voted down, at least until the proponents admit their deception and agree to stick to facts.

 

 Multiple shooters, 5 or more sites

 

 Aside from the Mandalay Bay, the police-radio intercept disclose two other nearby shooting scenes: the Tropicana and New York New York hotels. The Tropicana hotel-casino is located across Las Vegas Boulevard South (aka The Strip) about a half block from the Mandalay Bay (the southernmost on The Strip). It directly adjoins the site of the Route 91 Harvest Festival, opposite the Mandalay.

 

 The rapid-fire shooting from the Tropicana is, therefore, consistent with eyewitness reports of a crossfire by the second shooter, who was likely killed by the police, as reported at the first Metropolitan Police news conference.

 

 A third shooter, firing from New York New York hotel, is reportedly in detention, presumably captured while trying to flee in a car across the boulevard to the Excalibur. The NYNY is across the boulevard from the Tropicana, or the same side of the street as Mandalay Bay (and the Luxor). It is at a catty-corner across from the open-air concert venue.

 

 There were three firing points in a deadly triangle, just like the trio at the Paris Bataclan (only 2 gunmen were killed, and one escaped) and Orlando Pulse (1 killed, 2 escaped). Triangulation is intended to keep the crowd confined rather than making a quick escape. (In a shooting situation, every couple of seconds feels like minute, when perception time slows to a crawl, and therefore within 20 seconds targeted individuals should be able to dash to escape or find cover, that is, in the case of a single gunman.) Even with those three shooters, at least one of them must have used a belt-loading machine gun, probably similar to a 7.62mm NATO standard, to account for the intense firepower within three minutes, along with the basso boom from the muzzle blast.

 

 Guests and staff at another separate cluster of two or three hotels also heard nearby low-caliber small-arms fire, shootings which so far can be interpreted as diversionary actions intended to confuse the police. These secondary incidents were at the Bellagio and Caesars Palace, and probably the Aria, at the corner of Flamingo Avenue, two blocks north of the Harvest Festival. Later that night a local civilian resident with a rifle tried to enter Caesars after having heard about gunshots fired inside.

 

 Gunfire at the Ali Baba Lebanese restaurant was later denied, although it may have been a misfired weapon kept ready by a back-up team to assist the escape of the hotel gunmen.

 

 Therefore, the hit squad in Las Vegas included a minimum of 5 gunmen, although more likely 6-7 shooters, with a contingent of support personnel for communications, logistics and transport as well as to trip up hotel security. Hotel staff at the Mandalay saw an assailant in a hotel security uniform being chased down a hall by police officers.

 

 The attack on Las Vegas was a small-scale paramilitary operation, probably involving a squad of radical Muslim ISIS supporters to avenge Obamas betrayal of the Caliphate. The ""one POC"" code word heard on police radio scanner likely refers to a ""person of color"", likely from Africa, perhaps Somalia or Sudan, implying the two other suspects were light-skinned, perhaps Arabs or even white American recruits.

 

 A most difficult problem in this incident is the code of silence among the hundreds of Muslim hotel workers and chauffeurs along The Strip, whose ultimate loyalties are with shariah law and not the U.S. Constitution. Vegas was a classic case study of the absolute failure and delusions about Muslim integration under the democratic traditions of American society. That is an undeniable fact that contributed enormously to the murder and mayhem, politically incorrect though it may sound.

 

 On the side of caution, one cannot discount the possibility of an Israeli Mossad deep-cover false-flag operation aimed at ensuring more military aid from the U.S. against Iran and other foes. As for the professional sad clowns called crisis actors, the online bloggers who spread this sort of chum for fools are cogs in the repressive machinery of state working for the Feds or the Mossad.

 

 For Paddock, to balk was a death sentence

 

 The only remotely honest law-enforcement official with public presence, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, stated that suspect Paddock intended to survive the massacre. His assessment was based on the presence of a precursor chemical for explosives and more guns inside his car, which was left in the parking level of the Metropolitan. In other words, Paddock did not commit suicide, and there was no reason for him to wait for SWAT to arrive.

 

 Since the firing had ceased by around 10:20 p.m., and the SWAT team did not storm his room until after 11:00, Paddock had 40 minutes to make his escape in the crowd of panicked guests down the elevators to the parking level. Why did he not exfiltrate?

 

 The only possible answer is: Because he was already dead, killed before the shooting spree started. Who would have murdered Paddock just prior to the gunfire on the crowd below? One of the gunmen, of course.

 

 Why? Because the would-be buyers of his stash of guns (none of them were legally purchased from registered firearms dealers, as implied by media fakery) had long suspected that his offer of weapons for sale was bait in an FBI-CIA trap. The ISIS knew very well that his disingenuous conversion to Islam was a ploy hatched by his bosses at the CIA and DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency).

 

 So the jihadists offered him one last test of faith before his martyrdom. At every terror site, at least one dead martyr must be left behind for the sake of the lone gunman myth, which benefits both the political class to appease public anger and also the terrorists trying to conserve manpower for their next strike. Paddock was more useful as a fall guy than as a fighter.

 

 To flush out informers, crime groups will often order a new member to murder an undercover police informant or a friend in a rival gang, as depicted in the Johnny Depp movie Donnie Brasco. In real life and in the movie, Joe Pistone aka Brasco was shrewd enough not to flinch and shot his pal Tony Mirra, to the satisfaction of the Bonnano mob, and no further questions were asked of the rookie who had earned their trust as an unquestioning obedient henchman.

 

 During the meeting to transfer the traceable guns to the ISIS men in his 32nd floor room, his client(s) would order him to start shooting at the concert-goers below as a test of faith. Caught totally off-guard by this demand to kill fellow Americans, Paddock would have balked. Instead of giving a straight answer, he probably requested a moment of prayer in the bathroom to think it over, allowing him to message his FBI support team.

 

 His prayer was answered with a gunshot to the back of the head. That bloody head is edited out the FBI photo of his body, if indeed that was his actual corpse. (Since he was laid out with a Kevlar vest, why wouldnt he also have worn a helmet to deflect bullets?) Thats when the ISIS team leader would text-message his gunman to commence the slaughter. They had no need for Paddocks dodgy cache of weapons; they brought their own heavier machine-guns to the fatwa fiesta.

 

 Now, boys and girls, if you want to be a secret agent for the Feds or the Agency, whenever the bad guys tell you to mow down your teammates, just do as they say and make sure there are no wounded survivors who might recognize you as one of their own and moan to you. Jeez, good to see you again, hey, how come youre not wearing a badge? Kill everyone, even your loved ones, or you too will soon join the dead. Thats what it takes to be a first-class Fed, utter ruthlessness arising from the will to survive with no space for regrets or chance of redemption. Its a lonely life that exits in hell.

 

 Every Breath You Take

 

 The sting operation known as Fast and Furious, initiated in 2009 by Obamas Attorney General Eric Holder turned into a self-inflicted disaster for law enforcement and national security. Supposedly traceable guns, embedded with RFID chips, were sold to the Mexican drug mafia. The concept was to track the homing devices inside the guns along the supply chain of felons up the ladder to the big bosses in Cuidad Juarez, Sinaloa state, the capital and other major smuggling hubs and money-laundering centers.

 

 Since mobile-phone service and hotspots can be spotty in those backwaters, the FBI lost track of those firearms. Its likely that the Mexican smugglers knew Fast and Furious was too good to be true, and took apart a gun to locate the tracking device. An estimated 10,000 civilian fatalities are attributed to those rapid-fire weapons, including American law-enforcement officials along the border, a blowback which led to an abrupt end of gun-walking. (The term means letting the criminals walk into a gun shop for an illegal purchase and walk out with firearms, in that case across the borderline.)

 

 The killings of Americans with Holders guns resulted in an internal-affairs probe into the source of those firearms,which was the arsenals of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms bureau (ATF, under the Department of Homeland Security). The Obama White House responded with a self-protective cover-up, and ATF bosses were under heat to perjure themselves before Congress. So this is when Stephen Paddocks airplane and his inexplicable wealth enter the dark picture show.

 

 Homicide or Suicide?

 

 Thats how one headline described the 2013 deaths of 20-year veteran ATF agent Paul Parisi and his wife Janine inside their home in Chantilly, Virginia. As an arson and explosives expert, Parisi was stationed at the local ATF field office, near the top-level forensic laboratory at Quantico, the FBI Academy, which also serves the scientific requests of Pentagons investigative unit called the Defense Security Service (DSS).

 

 One of the questions related to Fast and Furious was the possible role of a suspected mafia mole inside U.S. law enforcement, so DNA testing and chemical analysis were meticulously done on recovered Fast and Furious guns, putting Paul Parisi on the wrong side in the eyes of certain higher-up circles who were not eager to see his forensic findings reach Congress.

 

 A Big Boppers Chantilly Lace

 

 In that same area of Virginia, starting in 2006, one Stephen C. Paddock (the Las Vegas suspects middle name is Craig), who was a resident of Henderson, Texas, and Mesquite, Nevada, based his Cirrus SR20, tail number N5343M, at Chantilly airfield. But then, just months after the Parisi deaths, he relocated the home field of that single-engine propeller plane 22 miles away to an airstrip at Roanoke.

 

 Parked at Roanoke for the next three years, the same-model Cirrus with identical tail number N5343M was registered as belonging to Volant LLC, which conducts top-secret assignments in intelligence and defense operations, something like the Mission Impossible team. Three weeks prior to the Vegas massacre, however, the Cirrus made its first recent flight, presumably by Paddock or another Agency pilot to deliver his consignment of guns to Las Vegas.

 

 Thanks to a vigilant citizen online by name of Mike, that defense contractor is now in the spotlight. The limited liability company describes its team of experts as follows: A Volant Associate proudly serves the needs of the nations Intelligence and Defense Community. Each associate matches a specific and rigorous profile and is the absolute best of his or her breed: a dedicated, driven, educated, broadly experienced leader who holds, at a minimum, an active Top Secret SCI clearance

 

 To translate the alphabet soup: Top Secret (TS); SCI means Sensitive Compartmented Information, or high-level access to classified information on file. This lacework of acronyms can deadlier for ones health than arsenic.

 

 A notable feature of the Cirrus SR20 model is its rocket-opened parachute, which prevents a damaged aircraft from crashing into buildings while carry dangerous cargo, for example, explosives or ammunition. With seating for 4 passengers (which can be used for cargo space) and a range of 780 nautical miles, the Cirrus is an ideal plane for arms traffickers, involved in Fast and Furious and/or its successor program transporting spooked guns to Islamic radicals.

 

 Online access to various employment agencies connected with Volant LLC have been blocked since recent revelations of Paddocks long-time relationship to that defense contractor.

 

 Dad was FBIs Most Wanted

 

 How could the eldest son of a bank robber, diagnosed as a psychopath, on the FBI Most Wanted List, become a government-trusted military contractor and a multimillionaire (with no visible means of support)?

 

 A migrant from Sheboygan, Wisconsin, to the Sunbelt, his father Benjamin Hoskins Paddock Jr. was arrested several times in the 1950s for automobile larceny, con games and passing bad checks, resulting in debts from which he tried to bounce back with two armed robberies at braches of the Valley Bank in Tucson, Arizona, in 1959 and '60. While serving a prison sentence, Big Ben (62 tall) staged a prison break in 1969 and was on the lam for 7 years, operating under a false identity as a bingo parlor operator in Oregon. Although none of his sons admit to being in contact with him, the family somehow survived on the ill-gotten lucre despite the FBI watch on their Tucson home.

 

 At the time of the prison escape and his posting on the Most Wanted list, Stephen Paddock was 15 years old, the eldest of four sons raised by their single mother. Contrary to the present-day medias attempt to cast a like father, like son psychoanalysis on Stephen, in fact he managed to earned a business degree from Cal State Northridge, which qualified him to work as accountant and also gave him training in algorithms, later used to win big at video poker in casinos. Methodical, calm and low-key, his biography so far has showed no signs of his being a psychotic. His only deviance was the hiring of $6,000 per session hookers for bondage fake-rape sex, a dominance-subordination pastime that millions of otherwise straight-laced men and women also seem to enjoy, for whatever mournful reasons.

 

 What is incongruous for the son of a fugitive bank robber, however, is that his entire working career, which lasted a mere 12 years, was entirely connected with the federal government, indicating the protection of the FBI over a potentially wayward youth. His first job was as a letter carrier, a mailman for the U.S. Postal Service, a routine that would prove useful later for his work as an intelligence contractor, if the mission required getting people to open their front doors and passing through neighborhoods unnoticed.

 

 After a short stint as an IRS auditor, he worked from 1985-89 as an in-house auditor for an as-yet unidentified aircraft maintenance company, which was later merged into Lockheed. Just a mere one year into that better-paying job, Paddock plonked down $400,000 cash to purchase outright a large house in Northridge, California.

 

 High Flier, High Times

 

 Whats sticks in my craw is those dates of employment at the mystery company simultaneous with Air Cocaine flights into Mena Airfield, a major aircraft maintenance center in Arkansas while Bill Clinton was governor. It was one of few jobs in that era where an ordinary employee (pilot or ground crew and manager) could earn a tax-free million dollars a year. Perhaps not by accident, Stephen Paddock and the husband of Marilou Danley own homes in Fayetteville-Springdale in the northwest corner of Arkansas, where east-west US Highway 40 meets north-south state road 71 to Mena.

 

 Whether or not his high times at Mena included helping Bill and the Hill roll up a carpet for Vince Foster, Paddocks subsequent low-profile career was as a small-plane pilot, shuttling contraband or people on contract with intelligence agencies or the Pentagon. News reports indicate he often flew a small plane from Nevada to Alaska during the annual hunting season, a flight distance farther than Honduras to Arkansas. For the Alaskan hunt, hes hauling a rifle of sufficient caliber to down a moose and maybe a few dollars more of extra hardware and ammo to offload in Idaho or Seattle.

 

 OK, so the question begs an answer: Was Stephen Paddock a CIA assassin, as the ones in Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne series? We have yet to locate the shallow unmarked graves, even if planes can also be used to dump bodies into lakes and oceans. Pity poor Joe Pesce in ""Casino"", who had to use a shovel to dig holes in the desert.

 

 ISIS Loyalty Pledge

 

 The ISIS website boasts that Paddock was converted to Islam in April 2017, pledging allegiance to their jihad. He probably crossed the threshold on one of his cruise ship tours from Greece to the Middle East, which included stopovers in Dubai and Jordan, accompanied by his female companion Danley, who claims to have a niece in the UAE. Jordan is landlocked and the best method of entering that country is through the port of Aqaba.

 

 Since it is by now certain that Paddock was a contract agent for U.S. intelligence, the Mideast cruise indicates:

 

 - first, that he entered the region by cruise ship to avoid detection at region airports where he was probably a known commodity ever since the invasion of military contractors during and after the Iraq wars; and

 - second, a CIA or DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) staffer, or a Mossad agent, would have escorted him for a quick briefing from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Jordanian border for his upcoming meetings with ISIS.

 

 Both Dubai and Jordan are major hubs for the Muslim Brotherhood, which was involved in the Hillary-Obama fiasco known as the Arab Spring and financed by the jihadist Emirate of Qatar. Lest Americans have forgotten by now, the Brotherhood launched the first attempted attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 and its members were aboard the 911 jetliners. Presumably, many and perhaps most of the captains of ISIS came out of the Brotherhood, the grandfather of modern jihad.

 

 Here again in the Paddock caper, the CIA-DIA revealed a basic lack of common sense, even after losing captured aid workers to ISIS decapitators. After all, who in their right mind would join ISIS when its barracks and arsenals were being pounded daily by Russian airstrikes? For Stephen Paddock, however, volunteering for this fools errand was perhaps his way of making up for the crimes of his father against American society. He was trying to redeem the family name, as hopeless and suicidal as that may have seemed. Theres nothing like Christian guilt to bring on Shariah law.

 

 Gift from Heaven

 

 The masterminds of ISIS must have interpreted Paddocks oath of fealty as a gift from Above, a doorway into the American heartland, even though it was through the tigers den, a trap laid by the CIA. By then, ISIS had a grudge match with President Barack Obama after he reneged on the trans-Syrian pipeline from Qatar to the Mediterranean and onto Cyprus and Ukraine, meant to compete with the hated Russians who have a near-monopoly on European gas supply.

 

 Despite the risks of entrapment, the ISIS chieftains had every reason to feel confident about the planned strikes on Orlando, Vegas and San Francisco, cities that represent to the Islamic community the sins of bestiality, gambling and homosexuality. (Animals that talk, as in the Disney menagerie are considered diabolical.) The Muslims were gaining the upper hand against their Satanic foe. The Awan brothers team had control of the computers in the House of Representatives, thanks to Debbie Wasserman Schultz; Tim Kaine along with the California Democrats were staunch in their support for open immigration and sanctuary cities, havens for ISIS sleeper cells; Obamas Pizzagate team set up a transport network for DACA children, ensuring a bright future for Islam in the New World; and Khizer Khan was gaining influence in the DNC. The counterattack was proceeding way faster than Saladins slow meandering drive against the Crusaders.

 

 While Stephen Paddocks intelligence bosses were eager to put marked guns in the hands of jihadist supporters in America, ISIS was many steps ahead of the intel bureaucrats James Comey, John Brennan and Loretta Lynch. If the killings at the Orlando Pulse were an initial taste of glory, the assault on Las Vegas would surely be a bumper harvest, a fiesta for the fatwa.

 

 While Paddock and his Agency superiors set the trap as neatly as he would fill an accounting ledger, the ISIS gunmen quietly took their stations at the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, the Aria, New York New York, Tropicana and the Mandalay Bay, while an armed back-up team delicately nibbled on baklava with Turkish coffee, awaiting orders.

 

 For Americans, a ghastly horrifying Halloween came early; but for ISIS the Autumn Moon glowed like honey dripping the sweet taste of revenge. In the Hijri calendar, the night of Oct. 1-2, 2017, marked the Islamic New Year, a blood sacrifice followed by a new dawn promising victory.

 

 Where to Go from Here

 

 Whats the prognosis? More of the same, because American society, including the self-serving political class, is much too narcissistic and divided to put up effective resistance to sustained attacks from fanatics who have no fear of dying and every reason to kill, in a era when citizens cannot even agree to stand up for the national anthem or celebrate Columbus Day, or even dare think of rallying around the commander in chief, all the while exulting in a frenzy of political correctness that prioritizes ones private issues like sexual orientation over tough personal sacrifices for the common good.

 

 The War on Terror and the Arab Spring, along with the absurd extremism of political correctness, as many of their critics like myself have repeatedly warned, have had devastating consequences for the United States and its democratic norms and cultural traditions. Until there is a minimal degree of unity as a nation, rising with a seachange among hearts and minds, the situation will deteriorate.

 

 In contrast to the attack on Pearl Harbor, which united the country often to excessive zeal, the Las Vegas Massacre was a sharp blow that fragmented the USA into a million broken pieces that may possibly never be glued back together again. Regardless of the folly and disunity of all the sunshine soldiers and anti-social nationhood haters, those who struggle to revive America as a Good Nation, while accepting that greatness has probably been lost forever, will trudge though the approaching Valley Forge of our time toward the battles ahead.",conspiracy

• Facebook drew scrutiny Wednesday for allowing the conspiracy-theory site Infowars to have a page on its platform.
• At a press event in which it emphasized its crackdown on misinformation and so-called fake news, it was pressed by CNN why Infowars still had a presence.
• Well known for pushing conspiracy theories, Infowars has claimed that Sandy Hook was a hoax, the moon landings were fake, and 9/11 was a so-called false flag.
• Facebook suggested Infowars published ""analysis"" and said banning pages would erode freedom of speech.

Facebook has drawn scrutiny over the fact it allows the conspiracy-theory website Infowars to operate a page on its platform just as the social network is promoting its efforts in dealing with intentionally false or misleading news.

After giving a presentation to US media outlets on Wednesday about its efforts to combat misinformation, Facebook took questions from reporters. CNN's Oliver Darcy asked how Facebook could be serious about tackling so-called fake news if it allowed Infowars to operate on its platform.

John Hegeman, the head of Facebook's News Feed, reportedly responded that Facebook did not ""take down false news.""

The phrase ""fake news"" has seen its meaning blur over time. Around 2016 it was widely used to describe false or misleading news designed to influence social-media users politically or to gain advertising dollars, but President Donald Trump has since popularized it as a phrase to dismiss coverage he doesn't like or to discredit accidental mistakes made by news organizations.

Infowars, whose Facebook page has almost 1 million followers, is known for pushing conspiracy theories on its site and on YouTube. Its host Alex Jones has claimed that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax with actors. The outlet has also said 9/11 was a so-called false flag and that the moon landings were faked. Jones also promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, for which he apologized after being threatened with lawsuits.

""I guess just for being false that doesn't violate the community standards,"" Hegeman said, saying Infowars had not incurred any violations that would result in its removal from Facebook. ""I think part of the fundamental thing here is that we created Facebook to be a place where different people can have a voice. And different publishers have very different points of view.""

When Hegeman's comments drew criticism from journalists, Facebook followed up with a series of posts on Twitter defending its position.

654,"The retired general whom President-elect Donald Trump tapped to advise him on matters of national security has promoted stories involving conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton.

Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn shared two thinly sourced articles on his Twitter account alleging that Clinton was involved in everything from ""money laundering"" to ""sex crimes with children"" just days before the election.

On November 2, the general tweeted a link to a website called True Pundit, which claimed to have spoken with ""NYPD sources"" involved in the investigation of Anthony Weiner. Flynn called it a ""must read"" — which many supporters likely did, since it was favorited and retweeted more than 12,000 times.

The fabricated news story originated on a number of right-wing blogs that were reporting little more than anonymous postings on internet message boards. As PolitiFact pointed out, the conspiracy theory that implicated Clinton in a ""political pedophile sex ring"" being investigated by the NYPD and FBI had no basis in fact.

Spokesmen for both agencies denied any investigation, according to PolitiFact.

Flynn later tweeted a link to the Breitbart website on November 4. The article to which he linked quoted former Blackwater CEO Erik Prince, who told a SiriusXM radio host that, during the Anthony Weiner investigation, ""They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times.""

Flynn shared the article with the hashtag #SpiritCooking — a reference to something said in a leaked email from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta.

The links to conspiracy theories about Clinton point to a larger problem over the proliferation of fake news that has erupted in recent weeks. But for supporters of President-elect Donald Trump and followers of the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, sharing of such articles gives an air of legitimacy to such wild claims.

Flynn headed the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012 to 2014 before he was reportedly forced out for mismanagement of the agency. Flynn has repeatedly claimed his firing came because of his views on radical Islam.",mainstream
742,"Five teenagers arrested after a Polish man was killed in a possible hate crime will face no further action due to a lack of evidence, police have said.

Arkadiusz Jozwik, a factory worker known as Arek, was attacked in August by a mob of up to 20 school-aged boys and girls.

The 40-year-old suffered serious head injuries after receiving a single blow to the head in a fracas outside a shop in Harlow, Essex, and died in hospital days later.

Six teenagers from Harlow were arrested on suspicion of murder but five were released from bail without charge due to insufficient evidence.

A 15-year-old from Harlow is due to answer bail tomorrow.

Arek died in hospital two days after being attacked outside the TGF Pizza and Mr Luigi’s takeaway shops in The Stow, Harlow.

Shelley Wright, who works at a hair salon in The Stow, said: “It’s disgraceful that nobody has been charged.

“It does feel safer with the police presence, without a shadow of a doubt it does make a difference, but that’s terrible.”

She said there were still flowers in tribute to Mr Jozwik on a bench in the shopping precinct.

“We do appreciate the police are coming round here but there are other places in Harlow where teenagers are now congregating,” she added.

“The problem has not gone away and they haven’t stopped it - they’ve just quashed it in this particular area.

“There are reports every day where these teenagers are congregating.”

The suspected hate attack gained international notoriety and led to Polish police officers patrolling the streets of Harlow.

And EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker caused outrage when he claimed Mr Jozwik’s murder showed the consequences of a disunited Europe.

Mr Juncker told MEPs in Strasbourg: “Europe can never accept Polish workers being harassed, beaten up or even murdered in the streets of Essex.”

Detective Inspector Danny Stoten, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: “The investigation into Arek Jozwik’s death is progressing and I am grateful to the Harlow community for their ongoing support.

“Arek’s family has been updated throughout the investigation. We have carried out a huge amount of work into the investigation.

“So far we have taken over 150 witness statements, spoken to over 300

people during house-to-house and general inquiries, and seized over 100 hours of CCTV, which is subject to ongoing viewing.

“In excess of 30 police officers and staff have been involved in the investigation and have committed over 1,200 additional hours.”",mainstream
926,"On the last Sunday afternoon in March, Mike Hughes, a sixty-two-year-old limousine driver from Apple Valley, California, successfully launched himself above the Mojave Desert in a homemade steam-powered rocket. He’d been trying for years, in one way or another. In 2002, Hughes set a Guinness World Record for the longest ramp jump—a hundred and three feet—in a limo, a stretch Lincoln Town Car. In 2014, he allegedly flew thirteen hundred and seventy-four feet in a garage-built rocket and was injured when it crashed. He planned to try again in 2016, but his Kickstarter campaign, which aimed to raise a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, netted just two supporters and three hundred and ten dollars. Further attempts were scrubbed—mechanical problems, logistical hurdles, hassles from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Finally, a couple of months ago, he made good. Stuff was leaking, bolts needed tightening, but at around three o’clock, and with no countdown, Hughes blasted off from a portable ramp—attached to a motorhome he’d bought through Craigslist—soared to nearly nineteen hundred feet, and, after a minute or so, parachuted less than gently back to Earth.",mainstream
1255,"Since actor Isaac Kappy recently accused major Hollywood celebrities of being involved in an elite pedophile ring, Paris Jackson has hired armed guards over fears of blowback from his whistleblowing.

The blue-eyed daughter of African-American pop star Michael Jackson has also moved out of her home to ""protect herself"" from the child abuse whistleblower.

Isaac Kappy has been speaking out about an alleged secret Hollywood pedophile ring involving powerful figures in the entertainment industry including Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.

Kappy also claims to have evidence that James Gunn, and Seth Green and his wife, actress Clare Grant, are a part of a child-sacrificing cult as well as being members of the Illuminati.

Videos of his confessions have since gone viral with Kappy now under investigation by the LAPD for reportedly threatening Paris Jackson and other Hollywood bigwigs at a party.

MovieWeb reports: Jackson has beefed up her security and moved out of her home for the time being to ""protect herself"" from Kappy, who many celebrities now claim is becoming ""unhinged.""

Jackson responded to initial contact from Kappy because she believed that he was ""suicidal.""

Last week, Isaac Kappy felt the need to state that he was not suicidal as his name started popping up in more news stories while also stating that he is not on opioids.

He's been posting a lot on 4Chan, 8Chan, Reddit, and Twitter, trying to get his supposed knowledge about the Hollywood pedophile ring out and into the mainstream media.

In addition, he has been retweeting links from the whistleblower QAnon and highlighting the PizzaGate theory again.

QAnon has slowly been creeping into the fan base of President Donald Trump and they believe that he is sending them coded messages through his tweets.

For instance, Trump usually tweets about 13 angry Democrats and Robert Mueller's investigation, but he tweeted 17 angry Democrats the other day.

Q is the 17th letter of the alphabet, therefore QAnon and Kappy believe that Trump is speaking to them and their agenda.

Isaac Kappy has tried to get support for his crusade against Hollywood pedophilia and the Illuminati, which has seen him gain over 20,000 followers on Twitter.

However, when he tried to get Corey Feldman on his side, he was promptly blocked by Feldman on the social media platform.

Feldman tweeted about Kappy, calling him a ""zero"" and referring to him as ""Mr. Crappy,"" while promising that the real truth about Hollywood is forthcoming.

Feldman has been a big advocate for child abuse survivors and many believed that he would be a part of Kappy's crusade, but that is obviously not the case.

Reports about Isaac Kappy are false, according to him.

He believes that he is being taken down and silenced by the deep state and that the Hollywood pedophile ring will continue.

Currently, Paris Jackson has armed guards and moved away from her home, Seth Green and his wife have also filed complaints, and the LAPD is investigating after Kappy promised a bullet storm if anybody came near his house.

1006,"The mainstream media is trying to blame Russian Twitter bots and bogus Facebook pages for spreading fake news that cost Hillary Clinton the election, but there remains little-to-no evidence at this point that the false stories actually influenced the election. 

 Disproved stories included Syrian refugees committing juvenile sex crimes in Twin Falls, Idaho, President Obama wanting to fund a Muslim museum and “Pizzagate” about a child sex ring in a pizza restaurant. But did these outrageous fake stories have any real effect on the election?

 In fact, the most damaging stories that were allegedly spread on phony social media accounts were factual stories -- and were disseminated by WikiLeaks, the same source that sparked the Arab Spring. 

 “The media is obsessed with proving Russia somehow fixed the election. Because that gives them an out. They don't have to come to terms with the fact that America chose Trump over Clinton,” Media Research Center vice president Dan Gainor told Fox News. Almost every American news organization – including Fox News – has published stories over the past few days regarding executives from the social media giants being asked to testify before Congress regarding Russia’s alleged election interference. In a lot of the coverage, the condemnation of Russian bots and shady Facebook sites obscure the fact some of the negative information that was spread about Clinton during the election was legitimate news.

The bulk of criticism regarding Russian election interference is that they spread completely fake stories. While foreign interference of any kind is obviously unacceptable and dangerous, it is important that real news doesn’t get lumped in with the misleading and false – regardless of who distributed it.

The emails leaked from then-Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s private email account to WikiLeaks were far from fake, but often get lumped in with fake news simply because pro-Kremlin bots pushed the narrative. 

 For example, The New York Times reported on Wednesday that “bot” accounts on Twitter “spread false stories” and promote “articles about emails from Democratic operatives that had been obtained by Russian hackers.” The language used makes it seem like all the emails obtained by Russian hackers were fake, but many leaked emails published by WikiLeaks have proven to be the real thing. 

 Earlier this month, the Times published a story headlined, “The fake Americans Russia created to influence the election,” which detailed “a legion of Russian-controlled impostors” who used social media to spread anti-Clinton news. The Times wrote that the information spread by these accounts would “would reverberate through the presidential election campaign and into the Trump presidency.”

 Other “bot” accounts pushed stories related to the Democratic National Committee email hack, and the method of distribution is obviously questionable, but the content of the emails is very real. “Russian fingerprints are on hundreds or thousands of fake accounts that regularly posted anti-Clinton messages,” the Times reported, barely mentioning that much of the anti-Clinton content was indeed factual. 

 By putting a spotlight on fake news, as opposed to the news that was proven to be true, Trump’s critics in the liberal media “don't have to come to terms with the fact that conservatives beat [them],” Gainor said. 

 If it weren’t for the leaked emails published by WikiLeaks, American voters presumably wouldn’t know that the Democratic Party’s leadership essentially worked to undermine Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign. Americans also wouldn’t know that then-DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s team reached out to NBC’s Chuck Todd to complain about the network’s coverage, or that Donna Brazile used her gig at CNN to leak questions to Clinton prior to Democratic primary debates. 

 Prior to Election Day, the BBC published,”18 revelations from WikiLeak’s hacked Clinton emails,” which details some of the scandalous details discovered in the leaked documents. Among the revelations were that corporations could allegedly pay for access to Bill Clinton, some of Hillary’s staffers felt she had “terrible” instincts, President Obama apparently knew about Clinton’s private email server before he initially said he did and even that former Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri allegedly mocked the Catholic religion.

761,"On local news stations across the United States last month, dozens of anchors gave the same speech to their combined millions of viewers.

It included a warning about fake news, a promise to report fairly and accurately and a request that viewers go to the station's website and comment ""if you believe our coverage is unfair.""

More from The New York Times:

It may not have seemed strange until viewers began to notice that the newscasters from Seattle to Phoenix to Washington sounded very similar. Stitched-together videos on social media showed them eerily echoing the same lines:

""The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media.""

""Some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias.""

""This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.""

The script came from Sinclair Broadcast Group, the country's largest broadcaster, which owns or operates 193 television stations.

Last week, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer published a copy of the speech and reported that employees at a local news station there, KOMO, were unhappy about the script. CNN reported on it on March 7 and said Scott Livingston, the senior vice president of news for Sinclair, had read almost the exact same speech for a segment that was distributed to outlets a year ago.

A union that represents news anchors did not respond immediately to requests for comment on Sunday.

Dave Twedell of the International Cinematographers Guild, who is a business representative for photojournalists (but not anchors) at KOMO in Seattle and KATU in Portland, Ore., said Sinclair told journalists at those stations not to discuss the company with outside news media.

Although it is the country's largest broadcaster, Sinclair is not a household name and viewers may be unaware of who owns their local news station. Critics have accused the company of using its stations to advance a mostly right-leaning agenda.

""We work very hard to be objective and fair and be in the middle,"" Mr. Livingston told The New York Times last year. ""I think maybe some other news organizations may be to the left of center, and we work very hard to be in the center.""

Sinclair regularly sends video segments to the stations it owns. These are referred to as ""must-runs,"" and they can include content like terrorism news updates, commentators speaking in support of President Trump or speeches from company executives like the one from Mr. Livingston last year.

But asking newscasters to present the material themselves is not something that Kirstin Pellizzaro, a doctoral candidate at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, remembered from her experience as a producer at a Sinclair-owned news station in Kalamazoo, Mich., from 2014 to 2015.

The station had to air ""must-run"" segments that came from Sinclair, which is based outside Baltimore. ""Some of them were a little slanted, a little biased,"" Ms. Pellizzaro said. ""Packages of this nature can make journalists uncomfortable.""

Sinclair representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. But Mr. Livingston told The Baltimore Sun that the script was meant to demonstrate Sinclair's ""commitment to reporting facts,"" adding that false stories ""can result in dangerous consequences,"" referring to the Pizzagate conspiracy as an example.

""We are focused on fact-based reporting,"" Mr. Livingston continued. ""That's our commitment to our communities. That's the goal of these announcements: to reiterate our commitment to reporting facts in a pursuit of truth.""

Ms. Pellizzaro said she can talk about Sinclair more freely now because she is working in academia, whereas journalists at stations owned by Sinclair might feel pressured not to bite the hand that feeds them.

""I hope people realize that the journalists are trying their best, and this shouldn't reflect poorly on them,"" she said. ""They're just under this corporate umbrella.""

Sinclair has been accused of using connections in the Trump administration to ease regulations on media consolidation. In an effort to expand its reach, the company is seeking approval from the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission for a $3.9 billion deal to buy Tribune Media.",mainstream

 For the sake of those in the audience who dont know her, pardon my frankness while we await an apology, Mika is the granddaughter of Edvard Benes, head of prewar Czechoslovakias Rothschild-controlled Jewish government and postwar Liquidator of ethnic Germans. Mikas father is none other than Zbigniew Brzezinski, the original sponsor of the Afghan jihadists and their boy dancers. Mr. Zbig is descended from one of those Polish noble families intermarried with cultist Jacob Franks well-oiled young maidens from Odessa. Mikas employer NBC is owned by Brian L. Roberts who in Yiddish is a mensch. The usher returns with a note so let me read it. This is an outrage!

 Eine Recliner Nachtmusik

 

 The child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart himself could not have equaled the rhapsodic thrills delivered over a two-night gig at the White House by the chamber quartet of James Alefantis, Christopher Moukarbel, Chris Crocker aka Cunningham, and Chelsea Swanger at a two-night performance, September 26-27, 2012.

 

 The star of the two overnights was Chris Crocker, who had morphed from his persona as an underage transvestite into a close-cropped gay porn actor. His notorious defense of Britney Spears, titled Leave Britney Alone! in which he flashed crotch, got the most hits of any online video in 2007, making him an instant celebrity.

 

 Crocker has since admitted to Huffington Post about sending people nude photos when I was 14 and that I have always been comfortable doing everything on camera, so I figured why not porn as well? Is it pedophilia if a boy voluntarily pimps himself out prior to the age of consent? It depends on the age of the sex partner and the type of sexual activity that ensued. The non-penetration rule was defined by Bill Clintons defense in the Monica Lewinsky case: I did not have sexual relations with that woman. Since Clinton was never defrocked and sentenced for receiving extramarital oral sex, the U.S. courts have not challenged his legal opinion that sex is not sex so long as traditional intercourse does not transpire. Anything else goes, under the Clinton notion of jurisprudence. Young Crockers online exhibitionism would still constitute child porn, possibly subjecting his parents or guardian to a considerable penalty and possible imprisonment.

 

 The Tennessee-born gay porn idol recallls meeting the boyfriend of documentary filmmaker Mourkarbel, who then featured Crocker, under the pseudonym Cunningham, in Me at the Zoo, which premiered at the Sundance Festival in January 2012. At the time of the White House overnighter, the pornographer was preparing rushes for an HBO series called Sex Now planned for release the following year, which featured online voyeurism and sexual services (dirty talk, stripping and masturbation by part-time sex workers called cam girls and cam couples). The series of three episodes released by HBO in summer 2015 were renamed Sex On, as in online.

 

 The fourth person with Alefantis was Chelsea Swanger, a freelance photographer who posts photos of female athletes and published at the Harrisburg Magazine in the town where Hersheys is located. Whether she engages in pornographic work is undisclosed.

 

 These aspiring young talents and Boy Scout leader Alefantis were shepherded supposedly for a West Wing tour by White House staffer Monica Lee, but the duration of their stay indicates an overnighter followed by a second sleep-over. The visitor departure log indicated 2359 hours (a minute before midnight), which is not about the bewitching hour when little Cinderellas turn back into ragamuffins or Uber rides revert to pumpkins. It means an overnight stay or at least slipping out in the wee hours into the darkness of Pennsylvania Avenue.

 

 Did the Alefantis crew, which included a photographer and notorious trannie/gay porn star, shoot video inside the White House for a porno video? If so, lets hope they mopped up the body-fluid stains from Dolly Madisons carpet. Or were these young talents there to enlighten the President and select members of his team with video clips on the latest trends in online pornography? However discomforting the scenario of a pedophile coven might be for American moms and dads who had sincerely believed in change and hope for the better, Alefantis made a swell impression in the presidents gleaming eyes.

 

 On that first day, September 26, the President gave speeches at Kent State and Bowling Green University, and then rushed back to the White House, arriving at 8:30 p.m., ahead of the arrival of Alefantiss pajama boys. On the following day, Obama flew to Virginia Beach for a campaign speech to the Farm Bureau, and then got back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue at 2:30 p.m. for a cat nap before a second nights pillow fight. If Im allowed to make an editorial comment, the President should keep his gay porn viewing to a remote safe house instead of sullying the heritage of the White House. British invaders set fire to it in revenge yet the White House survived, but the national symbol cannot stand for long when termites are gnawing within.

 

 There are three other Alefantis visits on the White House visitor register, which have caused some confusion in reddit discussions:

 

 - December 16, 2010 6 p.m. to 11:59 p.m. Alefantis arrived at the invitation of POTUS with 497 other guests to attend an evening ceremony to appoint singer Jon Bon Jovi to the new White House Advisory Council on Community Solutions. The 1980s glam rocker from New Jersey was adored by fans for his androgynous pretty JonBenet face and tail wiggling that appealed to married women and young boys. Meanwhile the president and his guests ignored the military veterans in the cold outside protesting against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without offering them even a cup of hot coffee, quite deplorable as far as hospitality goes. 

 

 - December 11, 2012 2 p.m to 9 p.m. Jimmy Comet was invited with 757 other guests to First Lady Michelle Obamas Toys for Tots collection. Alefantis, who collected toys from customers at Comet Pizza and his Bucks restaurant, was scheduled to arrive at 2 p.m. indicating that he may have attended an unlisted meeting before the evening reception. Undoubtedly, the regulars at Comet Pizza had closets full of toys for young boys and girls with enough to spare for orphans and poor youths in the ghetto, an investment in the future if there ever was. Merry XXXmas, kids. Want to sit on Santas lap?

 

 - April 9, 2014 6:45 pm to 11:59, is an odd meeting, the nature of which has mystified Pizzagate online researchers.

 

 Arias from The Mandarins Son

 

 On April 9, 2014, from 6:45 pm to 11:59 (past midnight), Jared Oestermiller with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) met with 19 gay activists, including James Alefantis aka Jimmy Comet.

 

 The guest list included real estate agents, a official in the trucking industry, journalists, attorneys, lobbyists and one pizzeria owner. If one excludes personal partners in attendance, there were 17 key players presence. Besides being gay, what was the common denominator among this motley crew?

 

 To understand the role of the magnificent seventeen, one must peruse the organizational chart of the U.S. intelligence community, which is subdivided into a pyramid topped by an upside-down pyramid, joined in the middle by a small square, like a dumbell (a bad analogy for national intelligence even though it fits, as in the DNI James Clappers spurious claim of fake news being perpetrated by Russian agents).

 

 Inside the lower pyramid are the 16-plus-one intelligence-gathering agencies, CIA, NSA, ONI, ATF, and so on. A super-secret 17th intel group is not shown on the official list. These agencies report to the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), led by James Clapper, positioned in the small square between the tips of the two triangles.

 

 The filtered intel findings and analyses from DNI then are moved upward into the inverted presidential triangle, through four layers of review before a neatly bound report lands on the desk in the Oval Office. These filters are the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which reviews the financial data and sifts through economic intelligence; the Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB), which double-checks and assesses the quality of analysis and sources; then the Presidents Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), where academic experts and veteran intel officials summarize position papers and proposals into executive briefs; and then on to the National Security Council (NSC), which sets policy and action plans for presidential approval.

 

 With all the career spooks caged inside the bottom triangle, which is watched over by DNI Clapper, the OMB inside the presidential triangle is free of intelligence oversight and ethics standards. Its autonomy from scrutiny means that the clandestine spy team under Oestermiller reports only to President Obama. Not bound by conventional rules, this secret corps of gay operatives can transport children across borders through networks of safehouses and arrange child-rape parties, sometimes with ritual murders, for the very same reason that the Caesars held orgies, which is to politically blackmail of senators and tycoons. Moral degradation is the glue that binds together a despotic regime.

 

 The Watergate plumbers were rank amateurs when compared with Obamas gay praetorian guard. Why is the Oestermiller meeting conspicuously on the White House record? Answer: To justify the generous budgetary line item for the gathered participants as discretionary spending by the Office of the President. Oestermillers previous job was at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) with a project on HIV-AIDS prevention. The CDC connection provides official cover for funding the presidents gay Stasi spy operation, funded with automatic approval from the OMB, the federal accounting office. The sneaky black budget explains how James Alefantis gets his nearly unlimited funds for restaurant investments, sponsorship of non-profit groups, avant-garde art events, travel to Berlin and Hawaii, and ownership of a string of properties in Washington DC and Virginia.

 

 Excuse us for this heavy orchestration since Part 8 of Pizzagate is supposed to be light entertainment. Policy wonks with perverse sexual habits can sure ruin an intermission, so lets indulge in a pause for refreshment. You ask whether Stolichnaya vodka is served at our mezzanine bar because good ole boys at CIA drink whiskey and rye? Nyet! The Moscow mule is a perfect cocktail for the Clinton crowd clinking glasses with Russian tycoons. So raise a glass of U-1 (UraniumOne) vodka: Pa-ye kha-lee! (Lets get started).

 

 Now, about the arias from the Mandarins Son, to comprehend these palace intrigues, one needs to recall the competing centers of imperial authority under the Chinese emperors. The Forbidden City was divided by the rivalry between the Mandarins of the civil bureaucracy and the Eunuchs of the royal harem. Since a despotic ruler cannot trust an independent bureaucracy that will outlive his reign, he will instead rely on a corps of tame, obedient castrati to staff his personal spy service and pen his edicts.

 

 Obamas gay Stasi constitute an independent hub of presidential power outside the intelligence nexus, insidiously collect ing sensitive personal information and compromising photos or video on senators, congressmen, bureaucrats, intel chiefs, governors, bankers, corporate executives, media moguls, celebrities and anybody who might threaten the presidents absolutist power. With its network of informers and pimps, and entrapment schemes, Obamas inner circle can blackmail nearly anybody who counts, as demonstrated by the ruling class unanimity on the big lie of fake news.

 

 The realtors with this secretive network provide safe houses, like the one Seth Rich stopped at for a last round with the contacts who had met him at a gay bar, before he headed home and met his death on a dark street. The murderous homosexual agents are part of the same crisis-management team deployed against Pizzagate. There is nothing novel about using gays for the states dirty work since the cross-dressing queer FBI director J. Edgar Hoover perfected these onerous methods of espionage and blackmail.

 

 The existence of a clandestine gay spy network raises questions of whether the earlier Alefantis-Crocker-Mourkarbel visits to the White House were arranged to show President Obama samples of compromising online videos of his opponents for their blackmail potential. James Alefantis appears to be first among equals in the gay Stasi, probably assigned to vetting those in attendance at Oestermillers parlay. Does that explain why Alefantis, as the secret deputy of the gay Stasi, was rated by GQ magazine as the 50th most powerful individual in Washington DC.?

 

 There is a precedent for a gay spy service known as the Sturmabteilung or storm troopers, the SA, who are also known as the Brown Shirts. Take note of brown in the handkerchief code. Jimmy Comet is the Ernst Rohm in our time. Beware of the Night of the Long Knives coming your way, Jimbo. Watch your back, bro, cause you happen to know too much.

 Alyssa A. Wilmoth, actor with the Capital Talent Agency (think: hiring of crisis actors for false flag ops)

 Now that secret circle of Obamas eunuchs is out, thanks to the sleuths of Pizzagate, it becomes clearer as to why all the lackeys jumped on the fake news bandwagon. The partys over, boys. Now for our next selection, polyphony from Telemanns opera buffa Pimpinone.

 

 Pinging Doktor Pong

 

 The Obama-Alefantis connection has deeper roots, as shown by the availability of a ham-and-pineapple pizza in East Berlin. Our passage to Hawaii starts below the Berlin Wall, or whats left of it, into the Death Strip on the edge of uber-hip Green Party stronghold Prenzlauerberg. This section of the infamous wall was preserved as a stretch of open space to memorialize East Germans who attempted escape but were gunned by the GDR border guards.

 

 Post-Cold War, the Death Strip is a graffiti-sprayed playground for teens, with its Sunday afternoon Bearpit amateur karaoke show in the amphitheater and outdoor basketball courts (take note, Barry, and be sure to tuck a hankie in your back pocket). Adjoining the Turkish ghetto of Kreutzberg, the Death Strip is a gay-cruising zone for those hankering after Arab, Kurdish, Kosovar, Bosnian or Albanian hot meat on a stick, a spicy kofta kebab slathered with tahini sauce.

 

 In year 2000, James Alefantis and partner Oliver Miller discovered Prenzlauerberg, where Miller opened Dr. Pong, a ping pong bar. San Francisco architect Miller had arrived to Berlin earlier, in 1993, when he noticed that ping pong is the only low-cost sport for plebeian youths in every sad town from Muncheberg to Kosovska and Bucak, Turkey. Playing ping pong is an easy way to strike up a conversation with penniless and hungry young kids eager to please an older male who takes them under his wing. In the sexually segregated Muslim realm, sex between an older man and a young boy is taken casually as a misdemeanor that goes unnoticed as opposed to the felony of adultery by a woman, which is punished by the death penalty. The bored boys from nearby Kreuzberg are easy pickings drawn to the bait of ping pong and beer.

 

 Just up the street from the Mauerpark market, the ping pong tables at Dr. Pong provided the model for Comet Ping Pong Pizza in Washington D.C. The Berlin pedo-center is described in a reddit post: Dr. Pong is a rugged little dingy bar in the heart of Prenzlauerberg, reminiscent of a teenage clubhouse with its minimal decor. Note teenage. Its limited beverage menu is mostly non-alcoholic for entry-level rough-trade Muslim boys circling around the game tables for the next volley in the group game of Around the World, a dress rehearsal for a daisy chain.

 

 While the Doctor doesnt do beer deliveries to embassy residences, theres probably a lot of demand from diplomats for take-out meat sticks, judging from the great reviews on Trip Advisers English-language list of the top 10 bars in Berlin. The Top Ten list fails to include the plusher interior of the fetishist KitKat Club. Another telling indicator is that 666 bar-hopping tours stop at Dr. Pong, indicating a connection to the Satanic rites similar to those in DC. Whats intriguing about Dr. Pong is that its male-on-male games may have provided the concept for torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Graibh prison.

 

 During the last years of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) or East Germany, Prenzlauerberg was the favored residential district for gays, hippies and avant-garde artists, a tradition that continued after national reunification in October 1990. Prenzlauerberg is also the location of Rykestrasse Synagogue, the largest Jewish center in Berlin, which was restored at great expense after reunification while Berlin was being restored to its former glory as a Jewish capital with coprophilia clubs and fetish bars to degrade the goyem.

 

 Oliver Millers arrival in 1993 coincided with the massive expansion of human trafficking of children for the European pedophile sex trade out of the war-torn Balkans in the wake of the Clinton-Blair NATO interventions to break apart Yugoslavia. Berlin was a transit point for children transshipped between Belgrade and the UK by the Kosovar mafia and Western military contractors including DynCorp. London is the wholesale global market for child sex slaves through fraudulent NGOs that act as adoption agencies.

 

 Sadly for Alefantis and Miller, the pair arrived a few years too late to join SchwuP, the Movement for Gay, Pederast and Transsexual Rights, which until 1987 was a wing of the Green Party, itself a product of the sexual liberation and drug experimentation theories of the CIA-allied Frankfurt School. Even after being busted for possession of methamphetamines, SchwuP leader Volker Berg survives as a parliamentarian in the Bundestag as the crusty old chief of the German-Israeli Parliamentary Friendship Group. Go chew on that, vice cops and DEA agents.

 

 In 1986, Volkers Schwuppies distributed this Green Party flyer to parliamentarians: He is a boy, roughly 10 years old, with a pretty face, full lips, a straight nose and shoulder-length hair. The wings of an angel protrude from his narrow back, and a penis is drawn with thin lines on the front of his body. In any country other than defeatist Germany beholden to the Israeli pedophiles, this sort of drivel is called illegal pornographic trash and justification for SWAT shoot-to-kill raids.

 

 The politically ambitious Greens eventually had to repudiate their support for sex with kindergarteners by their founders including Danny the Red Cohen-Bendit, the CIA-promoted leader of the 1968 student riots in Paris. The pedophile campaign was carried forward until 2008 by Volker Bergs partner Jacques Teyssier, a former member of the French intelligence service, who was on board of the Lesben und Schwulenverband in Deutschland (LSVD), the lesbian and gay association in Germany. The German gay movement is obviously a brainwashed arm of the CIA.

 

 The darker side of the pedophilic underground has since been carried on by a provocative novelist with the pen name Klaus Wanninger, the Anonymous of the Karlsruhe-based Schwaben-sumpf (the Schwabian Swamp). Sadistic and Satanic imagery was developed in parallel by this deviant strain, which obviously has had a huge influence on the artists and customers at Comet Ping Pong Pizza.

 

 In early 2012, Alefantis and Miller teamed up to start a restaurant called Nalu or wave in Hawaiian. The partnership in the Berlin restaurant inspired Alefantis to sponsor a sausage festival at his Bucks Fishing and Camping restaurant in Washington DC to honor a visit by Oliver Miller. There is no indication that Nalu or Dr. Pong has ever celebrated Octoberfest in Berlin by adding traditional bockwurst mit sauerkraut und senf (mustard) to their menus.

 

 Hotdog Stand in Hawaii

 

 A reference to sausages did appear in an email that Obamas chief climate-change negotiator Todd Stern sent to John Podesta.

 Subject: man, I miss you

 The next three months are going to be rougher internally than in Beijing. Between 7th and 1600, no fun. Hope youre doing ok. Im dreaming about your hotdog stand in Hawaii. . .

 

 The term 7th refers to the 7th floor of the State Department, with 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue being the address of the White House. After convincing the government China to support UN COP21, Stern was stressed-out by the preparations and diplomatic push for the make-or-break 2015 Paris climate-change conference. That much is clear, but the strange communication about a hotdog stand in Hawaii has been a matter of conjecture among reddit and Voat sleuths. One post suggested it referred to a fast-food joint on Molokai island, owned by a man with the surname of Podesta, but the suspicion was in error since one of the two given names does not match that of Hillarys campaign manager.

 

 A more reliable lead emerged when online researchers tracked down the business history of the Arab-owned Besta pizzeria, located two doors down from Comet Ping Pong in DC. That search disclosed local ownership of a Besta Pizza by the Filipino-American Batin family in Koloa, Kauia in the State of Hawaii, under a franchise based in Las Vegas. The since-bankrupted pizzeria on Kauai island is the probable place that James Alefantis learned the art of wood-fired pizza-making, specializing of course in ham-and-pineapple and seafood toppings. After the closure of the Las Vegas office, the franchise operator FCD Property LLC reappeared on the East Coast in Baltimore and, under Arab ownership, near Comet Ping Pong.

 

 Kauai, the Garden Island renowned for its tropical ecology, is a favored destination for ultra-wealthy global jet-setters, who are too snooty to set foot in tourist-packed Waikiki, the likes of whom include Pierce Brosnan, Ben Stiller and Michael Crichton. Barack Obama has frequently vacationed there, most recently on for a ceremony in September 2016 to declare the worlds largest marine reserve stretching from Kauai to the Midway islands.

 

 What besides plumeria blossoms and papaya trees brought Barry OBomber Soetaro and James Achilles Alefantis to this haven for the rich and famous? One of the major attractions of Hawaiian resorts is, of course, prostitution and, given slack law enforcement, the beach boy trade for tourists, female or male. Did Alefantis moonlight as a male escort, and then work his way up the job ladder as a procurer of teenagers for wealthy gay visitors? Kauai was the probable starting point for businessman Alefantiss daily special combo of pizza and underage sex workers.

 

 Along with teen boys, another attraction prior to the legalization of cannabis dispensaries was the illegal marijuana and methamphetamine trade, boosted by the states Maui Wowie image, always a plus factor for laidback Kauai gay pride fests. With this context in mind, a second look at the Stern-Podesta email indicates that the White House climate-change official had probably stopped over in Hawaii on the way from Washington DC to Beijing. There, on Koloa Landing, Poipu beach, is the hotdog stand, a codeword for underage male prostitutes. (Intimacy with adult beach boys is legal whenever payment for a sex session is included in the surfing lesson, and so the hotdog code is intended for beach boys under 18 years of age.)

 

 The use of past tense indicates Stern had earlier been introduced to the Kauai boy-sex scene by John Podesta, a frequent visitor to Hawaii in the entourage going to President Obamas home state and possibly earlier. Todd D. Stern was a member of Vice President Al Gores delegation to the 1997 Kyoto Summit on Climate Change. The main sponsors of that event in Japan were the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the utility that would gain notoriety for its cover-ups of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and Toyota Motor Exports, which was planning a future of electric cars recharged by nuclear power plants, thus the anti-coal strategy. Al Gore is a nuclear proponent whose political base is in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a leading nuclear investment zone. High-percentile THC joints on a Kauai beach probably accounts for the lunacy of signing aboard the Kyoto Protocol of the Elders of TEPCO.

 

 The blowback from nuclear collusion onto the Hawaiian Islands happened within days of the Fukushima meltdowns of mid-March 2011, with huge spikes in radioactivity levels wafting across the Pacific, which soon led to mutations of vegetation across the islands. The information on the biological effects of nuclear contamination was totally suppressed by Obamas Department of Energy. The federal cover-up prevented public-health responses to combat the steady rise in the local rates of heart-failure and cancer, which rose after a long period of decline prior to 2011, and were therefore likely due to radioactivity exposure. Since Fukushima, Hawaii is no longer a green paradise and is instead a death trap for residents and visitors who loiter near the nuclear-contaminated seawater along the beach. By failing to warn and protect the Hawaiian population from radioactivity, Barry Obama has doomed his reputed birthplace, which he does not treat as a genuine motherland.

 

 Theres only one question left to answer, how do you want your hotdog? Mustard, relish, kraut or relish, or simply undressed?

 

 Trivia from the Magic Flute

 

 Our program concludes with alto tenor Jaime Les-Enfantes presenting a sample of melodies from Mozarts menagerie of wild beasts and Frankist warlocks.

 

 - Greek connection: The Alefantis family are descendants of Greek immigrants. John and Tony Podestas mother Mary Kokoris is Greek. Alex Tsipras, prime minister of Greece, is of course the fellow Greek who aided and abetted Bill Clinton and George Soros in organizing the European migrant crisis of 2015 that sent thousands of unaccompanied refugee children to human trafficking networks in the Balkans and Western Europe. Everythings connected.

 

 - Georgetown link: John Podesta received his law degree from the law school of Georgetown University to become the great protector of the national pedophile network. James Alefantis graduated with honors from elite Georgetown Day School before migrating to Indiana and Hawaii, then on to pedo Berlin and back to DC.

 

 - Tony Podestas ex-wife Heather Miller has not publicly disclosed her origins, but a search of the historical record shows her hometown to be Nicolaus, California, population 211 in the 2010 census, an agrarian village located on the outskirts of Yuba City and on the bank of the Feather River, near Sutters Mill, a site famous for the 49er gold rush. Shes a small-town yokel who struck it rich as a corporate lobbyist and art collector. Whats she got that the rest of us dont?

 

 With that, our program of light entertainment has drawn to an ed. Next week we resume our grand symphony series with the big guns of Wagner horsn and timpani kettles. We hope youll join us for another evening of classical delights. Miss Cunningham, Christine, if youd be so nice as to escort these gentlemen to their car. Charming girl, isnt he?

 

 Yoichi Shimatsu is a Hong Kong-based investigative journalist and former lecturer of news reporting and media studies at three universities.",conspiracy
159,"When things get serious in the media space, my friends at the Knight Foundation rally the troops. Last week, I was invited to a workshop Knight held with the Aspen Institute on trust, media and democracy in America. I prepared a whitepaper for the workshop, which I’m publishing here at the suggestion of several of the workshop participants, who found it useful.

The paper I wrote – “Mistrust, efficacy and the new civics: understanding the deep roots of the crisis of faith in journalism” – served two purposes for me. First, it’s a rough outline of the book I’m working on this next year about mistrust and civics, which means I can pretend that I’ve been working on my book this summer. Second, it let me put certain stakes in the ground for my discussion with my friends at Knight. Conversations about mistrust in journalism have a tendency to focus on the uniqueness of the profession and its critical civic role in the US and in other open societies. I wanted to be clear that I think journalism has a great deal in common with other large institutions that are suffering declines in trust. Yes, the press has come under special scrutiny due to President Trump’s decision to demonize and threaten journalists, but I think mistrust in civic institutions is much broader than mistrust in the press.

Because mistrust is broad-based, press-centric solutions to mistrust are likely to fail. This is a broad civic problem, not a problem of fake news, of fact checking or of listening more to our readers. The shape of civics is changing, and while many citizens have lost confidence in existing institutions, others are finding new ways to participate. The path forward for news media is to help readers be effective civic actors. If news organizations can help make citizens feel powerful, like they can make effective civic change, they’ll develop a strength and loyalty they’ve not felt in years.

To my surprise and delight, the workshop participants needed little or no convincing that journalism’s problems were part of a larger anti-institutional moment in America. I brought in Chris Hayes’s idea that “left/right” is no longer as useful a distinction in American politics as “insurrectionist/institutionalist”, and we had a helpful debate about what it would mean to bring insurrectionists – those who believe our institutions are failing and need to be replaced by newer structures – into a room full of institutionalists – people who see our institutions are central to our open society, in need of strengthening and reinforcement, but worth defending and preserving.

What started to emerge was a two-dimensional grid of left/right and insurrectionist/institutionalist to understand a picture of American politics that can include both the Occupy Movement and Hillary Clinton as leftists, and Donald Trump and Paul Ryan on the right. While the US is currently wrestling with right-wing insurrectionism (and this meeting happened even before neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville, VA and the President assured us that some of them were nice people) it’s important to remember that anti-institutionalism comes in a variety of flavors. (One researcher at the meeting observed that the common ground of insurrectionism may explain the otherwise weird phenomenon of Bernie supporters going on to support Trump.)

Another idea that came up was that the categories of institutionalism and insurrectionism are fluid and changing, because revolutionaries quickly become institutions. When Google came into the search engine game, it was a revolutionary new player, upending Yahoo!, Lycos, Alta Visa and others. Twenty years later, it’s one of the most powerful corporate and civic actors in the world. Understanding that successful revolutions tend to beget institutions is helpful for understanding insurrectionism as a political pole. Some insurrectionists will win their battles and may find themselves defending the institutions they build. (I think fondly of my friend Joi Ito, who spent years as an enfant terrible in Japanese internet circles before becoming surprisingly acceptable as the director of the MIT Media Lab.) Others will hold onto insurrectionism even when their side wins – my friend Sami ben Gharbia moved seamlessly to being a critic of the Ben Ali government in Tunisia to critiquing the new government the Arab Spring brought to power.

Understanding that revolutions beget new institutions made me think of Pierre Rosanvallon’s work on Counterdemocracy, which isn’t as well known in the US as it should be. Rosanvallon observes that, during the French Revolution, a slew of new institutions sprang up to ensure the new leaders stayed true to their values. This wasn’t always a pretty picture – the Terror came in part from the institutions Rosanvallon explores – but the idea that democracy needs to be counterbalanced and bolstered by forces of oversight, prevention and judgement is one worth considering as we examine modern-day institutions and their shortcomings.

When a disruptive entity like Google or Facebook becomes an institution, it’s incumbent on us to build systems that can monitor their behavior and hold them accountable. It’s rare that existing regulatory structures are well-equipped to serve as counter-democratic institutions to counterbalance the new ways in which they work. As a result, there’s at least two ways look for change as an insurrectionist: you can identify institutions that aren’t working well and strive to replace them with something better, or you can dedicate yourself to monitoring and counterbalancing those institutions, building counterdemocratic institutions in the process.

What does this mean for the fine folks working with Knight on news and trust? The press is a key part of counterdemocracy. It needs to hold power responsible. As democratic institutions of power change, counterdemocratic systems have to change as well – nostalgia for how the press used to work is less helpful than understanding the way in which political and civic power are changing, so that the press can continue to act as an effective counterweight. The good news for me was that the folks at Knight are emphatically not holding onto a nostalgic view of the press, trying to return to a Watergate golden age. The bad news? Just like the rest of us, they don’t know what the shape of this emergent new civics is either.

Here’s a prettier version of this paper, hosted my MIT’s DSpace archive. What follows below is a less pretty, but web-friendlier version.

Mistrust, efficacy and the new civics: understanding the deep roots of the crisis of faith in journalism Ethan Zuckerman, Center for Civic Media, MIT Media Lab August 2017

Executive summary Current fears over mistrust in journalism have deep roots. Not only has trust in news media been declining since a high point just after Watergate, but American trust in institutions of all sorts is at historic lows. This phenomenon is present to differing degrees in many advanced nations, suggesting that mistrust in institutions is a phenomenon we need to consider as a new reality, not a momentary disruption of existing patterns. Furthermore, it suggests that mistrust in media is less a product of recent technological and political developments, but part of a decades-long pattern that many advanced democracies are experiencing.

Addressing mistrust in media requires that we examine why mistrust in institutions as a whole is rising. One possible explanation is that our existing institutions aren’t working well for many citizens. Citizens who feel they can’t influence the governments that represent them are less likely to participate in civics. Some evidence exists that the shape of civic participation in the US is changing shape, with young people more focused on influencing institutions through markets (boycotts, buycotts and socially responsible businesses), code (technologies that make new behaviors possible, like solar panels or electric cars) and norms (influencing public attitudes) than through law. By understanding and reporting on this new, emergent civics, journalists may be able to increase their relevance to contemporary audiences alienated from traditional civics.

One critical shift that social media has helped accelerate, though not cause, is the fragmentation of a single, coherent public sphere. While scholars have been aware of this problem for decades, we seem to have shifted to a more dramatic divide, in which people who read different media outlets may have entirely different agendas of what’s worth paying attention to. It is unlikely that a single, authoritative entity – whether it is mainstream media or the presidency – will emerge to fill this agenda-setting function. Instead, we face the personal challenge of understanding what issues are important for people from different backgrounds or ideologies.

Addressing the current state of mistrust in journalism will require addressing the broader crisis of trust in institutions. Given the timeline of this crisis, which is unfolding over decades, it is unlikely that digital technologies are the primary actor responsible for the surprises of the past year. While digital technologies may help us address issues, like a disappearing sense of common ground, the underlying issues of mistrust likely require close examination of the changing nature of civics and public attitudes to democracy.

Introduction The presidency of Donald Trump is a confusing time for journalists and those who see journalism as an integral component of a democratic and open society.

Consider a recent development in the ongoing feud between the President and CNN. On July 2nd, Donald Trump posted a 28 second video clip to his personal Twitter account for the benefit of his 33.4 million followers. The video, a clip from professional wrestling event Wrestlemania 23 (“The Battle of the Billionaires”), shows Trump knocking wrestling executive Vince McMahon to the ground and punching him in the face. In the video, McMahon’s face is replaced with the CNN logo, and the clip ends with an altered logo reading “FNN: Fraud News Network”. It was, by far, Trump’s most popular tweet in the past month, receiving 587,000 favorites and 350,000 retweets, including a retweet from the official presidential account.

CNN responded to the presidential tweet, expressing disappointment that the president would encourage violence against journalists. Then CNN political reporter Andrew Kaczynski tracked down Reddit user “HanAssholeSolo”, who posted the video on the popular Reddit forum, The_Donald. Noting that the Reddit user had apologized for the wrestling video, as well as for a long history of racist and islamophobic posts, and agreed not to post this type of content again, Kaczynski declined to identify the person behind the account. Ominously, he left the door open: “CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.” The possibility that the video creator might be identified enraged a group of online Trump supporters, who began a campaign of anti-CNN videos organized under the hashtag #CNNBlackmail, supported by Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who took to Twitter to speculate on the crimes CNN might have committed in their reportage. By July 6th, Alex Jones’s Infowars.com was offering a $20,000 prize in “The Great CNN Meme War”, a competition to find the best meme in which the President attacked and defeated CNN.

It’s not hard to encounter a story like this one and wonder what precisely has happened to the relationship between the press, the government and the American people. What does it mean for democracy when a sitting president refers to the press as “the opposition party”? How did trust in media drop so low that attacks on a cable news network serve some of a politician’s most popular stances? How did “fake news” become the preferred epithet for reporting one political party or another disagrees with? Where are all these strange internet memes coming from, and do they represent a groundswell of political power? Or just teenagers playing a game of one-upsmanship? And is this really what we want major news outlets, including the Washington Post, the New York Times and CBS, to be covering?)

These are worthwhile questions, and public policy experts, journalists and academics are justified in spending significant time understanding these topics. But given the fascinating and disconcerting details of this wildly shifting media landscape, it is easy to miss the larger social changes that are redefining the civic role of journalism. I believe that three shifts underlie and help explain the confusing and challenging landscape we currently face and may offer direction for those who seek to strengthen the importance of reliable information to an engaged citizenry:

– The decline of trust in journalism is part of a larger collapse of trust in institutions of all kinds – Low trust in institutions creates a crisis for civics, leaving citizens looking for new ways to be effective in influencing political and social processes – The search for efficacy is leading citizens into polarized media spaces that have so little overlap that shared consensus on basic civic facts is difficult to achieve

I will unpack these three shifts in turn, arguing that each has a much deeper set of roots than the current political moment. These factors lead me to a set of question for anyone seeking to strengthen the importance of reliable information in our civic culture. Because these shifts are deeper than the introduction of a single new technology or the rise of a specific political figure, these questions focus less on mitigating the impact of recent technological shifts and more on either reversing these larger trends, or creating a healthier civic culture that responds to these changes.

Since 1958, the National Election Study and other pollsters have asked a sample of Americans the following question: “Do you trust the government in Washington to do the right thing all or most of the time?” Trust peaked during the Johnson administration in 1964, at 77%. It declined precipitously under Nixon, Ford and Carter, recovered somewhat under Reagan, and nose-dived under George HW Bush. Trust rose through Clinton’s presidency and peaked just after George W. Bush led the country into war in Iraq and Afghanistan, collapsing throughout his presidency to the sub-25% levels that characterized Obama’s years in office. Between Johnson and Obama, American attitudes towards Washington reversed themselves – in the mid 1960s, it was as difficult to find someone with low trust in the federal government as it is difficult today to find someone who deeply trusts the government.

Declining trust in government, especially in Congress – the least trusted branch of our tripartite system – is an old story, and generations of politicians have run against Washington, taking advantage of the tendency for Americans to re-elect their representatives while condemning Congress as a whole. What’s more surprising is the slide in confidence in institutions of all sorts. Trust in public schools has dropped from 62% in 1975 to 31% now, while confidence in the medical system has fallen from 80% to 37% in the same time period. We see significant decreases in confidence in organized religion, banks, organized labor, the criminal justice system and in big business. The only institutions that have increased in trust in Gallup’s surveys are the military, which faced Vietnam-era skepticism when Gallup began its questioning, and small business, which is less a conventional institution than the invitation to imagine an individual businessperson. With the exception of the military, Americans show themselves to be increasingly skeptical of large or bureaucratic institutions, from courts to churches.

American media institutions have experienced the same decades-long fall in trust. Newspapers were trusted by 51% of American survey respondents in 1979, compared to 20% in 2016. Trust in broadcast television peaked at 46% in 1993 and now sits at 21%. Trust in mass media as a whole peaked at 72% in 1976, in the wake of the press’s role in exposing the Watergate scandal. Four decades later, that figure is now 32%, less than half of its peak. And while Republicans now show a very sharp drop in trust in mainstream media – from 32% in 2015 to 14% in 2016, trust in mass media has dropped steadily for Democrats and independents as well.

In other words, the internet and social media has not destroyed trust in media – trust was dropping even before cable TV became popular. Nor is the internet becoming a more trusted medium than newspapers or television – in 2014, 19% of survey respondents said they put a great deal of trust in internet news. Instead, trust in media has fallen steadily since the 1980s and 1990s, now resting at roughly half the level it enjoyed 30 years ago, much like other indicators of American trust in institutions.

It’s not only Americans who are skeptical of institutions, and of media in particular. Edelman, a US-based PR firm, conducts an annual, global survey of trust called Eurobarometer, which compares levels of trust in institutions similar to those Gallup asks about. The 2017 Eurobarometer survey identifies the US as “neutral”, between a small number of high trust countries and a large set of mistrustful countries. (Only one of the five countries Eurobarometer lists as highly trusting are open societies, rated as “free” by Freedom House: India. The other four – China, Indonesia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, are partly free or not free. Depressingly, there is a discernable, if weak, correlation (R2=0.162) between more open societies and low scores on Edelman’s trust metric.) As in the US, trust in media plumbed new depths in Eurobarometer countries, reaching all time lows in 17 of the 28 countries surveyed and leaving media contending with government as the least trusted set of institutions (business and NGOs rate significantly higher, though trust in all institutions is dropping year on year.)

So what happened to trust?

By recognizing that the decrease in trust in media is part of a larger trend of reduced trust in institutions, and understanding that shift as a trend that’s unfolded over at least 4 decades, we can dismiss some overly simplistic explanations for the current moment. The decline of trust in journalism precedes Donald Trump. While it’s likely that trust in media will fall farther under a government that presents journalists as the opposition party, Trump’s choice of the press as enemy is shrewd recognition of a trend already underway. Similarly, we can reject the facile argument that the internet has destroyed trust in media and other institutions. Even if we date broad public influence of the internet to 2000, when only 52% of the US population was online, the decline in trust in journalism began at least 20 years earlier. If we accept the current moment as part of a larger trend, we need a more systemic explanation for the collapse of trust.

Scholars have studied interpersonal trust – the question of how much you can trust other individuals in society – for decades, finding the broader world shows fairly stable interpersonal trust. Yet a decrease of trust in institutions is widespread globally, as seen both in the Eurobarometer data and in Gallup OECD data. It’s not just that we trust each other less – people around the world appear to trust institutions less.

It’s also possible that reduced confidence in institutions could relate to economic stress. As numerous scholars, notably Thomas Piketty, have observed, economic inequality is reaching heights in the US not seen since the Gilded Age. The decrease of confidence in institutions roughly correlates with the increase Piketty sees in inequality, which is stable through the 50’s, 60’s and mid-70’s, rising sharply from there.

We might think of an explanation in which citizens, frustrated by their decreasing share of the pie, punish the societal institutions responsible for their plight. But with this explanation, we would expect to see rising inequality accompanied by a steady drop in consumer confidence. We don’t – consumer confidence in the US and in the OECD more broadly is roughly as high now as it was in the 1960s, despite sharp drops during moments of economic stress and a rise during the “long boom” of the ’90s and 2000s. It’s possible that citizens should be punishing governments, banks and businesses for rising inequality, but consumer behavior and confidence doesn’t corroborate the story.

I favor a third theory, put forward by Kenneth Newton and Pippa Norris, called the institutional performance model. Simply put, when institutions perform poorly, people lose trust in them: “It is primarily governmental performance that determines the level of citizens’ confidence in public institutions.” That trust in institutions, easily lost, takes a long time to regain. We might understand the collapse of confidence in US institutions as a set of high visibility crises: Vietnam and Watergate as eroding confidence in the federal government, the Catholic Church sex scandal destroying trust in that institution, the 2007 financial collapse damaging faith in banks and big business.

Newton and Norris developed their theories in the mid-1990s, noting that confidence in public institutions was plumbing new depths. In retrospect, their concerns seem well-founded, as the trends they observed have simply increased over time. In the mid 1990s, Newton and Norris were comfortable positing a relationship between society-wide interpersonal trust and trust in institutions – that relationship is less clear now, because interpersonal trust has remained fairly constant while trust in institutions has decreased. One explanation for the decrease in institutional trust is that institutions have performed poorly, and that citizens are increasingly aware of their shortcomings.

Cultural and technological shifts may have made it easier for institutions to lose trust and harder to regain it. Watergate returned the US press to its progressive-era muckraking roots and ended a period of deference in which indiscretions by figures of authority were sometimes ignored. (It’s interesting to imagine the Clinton-era press covering JFK’s personal life.) An explosion in news availability, through cable television’s 24-hour news cycle and the internet, has ensured a steady stream of negative news, which engages audiences through fear and outrage. The rise of social media fuels the fire, allowing individuals to report institutional failures (police shootings, for example) and spread their dismay to friends and broader audiences. Accompanying the evolution of media technologies is education: in 1971, 12% of Americans had graduated from college, and 57% from high school. By 2012, 31% had college degrees, and 88% had high school diplomas. The citizens of 2017 are better positioned to be critical of institutions than those of 1964.

If we accept any of these explanations for a decrease in trust in institutions, the obvious question emerges: How do we reverse this trend? How do we restore public trust?

It’s worth noting that those most concerned with restoring public trust tend to be elites, those for whom existing institutions are often working quite well. Eurobarometer’s 2017 report focuses on a widening trust gap between a well-informed 15% of the population and a less informed 85%. The well-informed minority scores 60 on Edelman’s trust index, while the less-informed majority is 15 points lower, at 45. The gap between elites and the majority is largest in the US – 22 points separate the groups.

One approach to institutional mistrust is to try and educate this disenchanted majority, helping them understand why our institutions are not as broken as we sometimes imagine. Any approach is unlikely to reach all citizens – some will remain frustrated and alienated, due to disinterest, misinformation, a healthy distaste for being told what to think, or due to the fact that their mistrust may be justified.

TV commentator Chris Hayes encourages us to recognize that those frustrated with institutions constitute a large and powerful segment of society. He suggests that dividing Americans into institutionalists, who want to strengthen and preserve our existing social institutions, and insurrectionists, who see a need to overhaul, overthrow, replace or abandon existing institutions, is at least as useful as dividing the population into liberals and conservatives. Insurrectionists include progressives (Bernie Sanders), libertarians (Rand Paul) and nationalists (Donald Trump), while both Republicans and Democrats are well represented within the institutionalist camp.

The defeat of a consummate institutionalist – Hillary Clinton – by an insurrectionist outsider suggests a need to take rising insurrectionism seriously. What if our citizens now include a large plurality unlikely to be persuaded to regain trust in our central civic institutions?

Assume for the moment that a large group of citizens is mistrustful of existing institutions. How do these citizens participate in civic life?

Low participation in congressional elections is often offered as evidence of the decline in American civic life. But in 2012, only 35 of 435 congressional seats were considered “swing” districts, where voting margins were within 5% of the national popular vote margin – the remaining 92% of districts strongly favor either a sitting Democrat or Republican. The safety of these districts leads to an extremely high rate of incumbent re-election, 95.9%. Combine the very low chance of making a difference in a Congressional election with extremely low trust in Congress (9% in 2016) and it’s easy to understand why many citizens – including some institutionalists – would sit an election out.

When we teach young people how to have a civic voice, we tend to emphasize the importance of voting as a baseline civic responsibility – as the bumper sticker says, “If you don’t vote, you can’t complain.” But at high levels of mistrust, voting doesn’t work very well. If we see Congress, the Senate or the presidency as dysfunctional institutions, either unlikely to accomplish much or to represent our interests, voting for representatives or encouraging them to advance or support legislation doesn’t feel like a powerful way to influence civic processes.

High levels of mistrust present a challenge for protest as well. Unless the goal of a protest – a march, a sit-in, an occupation – is the fall of a regime (as it was with the protests of the Arab Spring), then a protest is designed to show widespread support for a political position and influence leaders. The March on Washington, likely the most remembered event of the civil rights movement as it culminated in Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, was, after all, a march on Washington. It sought to pressure President Kennedy and Congress to take action on civil rights legislation and is credited with creating the momentum for LBJ to act quickly on civil rights after Kennedy’s assassination.

What happens when protesters no longer trust that institutions they might influence can make necessary social changes? The Occupy movement was widely criticized for failing to put forward a legislative agenda that representatives could choose to pass. Occupiers, in part, were expressing their lack of confidence in the federal government and didn’t put forth these proposals because their goal was to demonstrate other forms of community decision-making. Whether or not Occupy succeeded in demonstrating the viability of consensus-based governance, the resistance of Occupiers to turning into a political party or advocacy organization shows a deep insurrectionist distrust of existing institutions and an unwillingness to operate within them.

The danger is that insurrectionists will drop out of civic life altogether, or be manipulated by demagogues who promise to obviate the complexities of mistrusted institutions through the force of their personal character and will. The hope is that insurrectionists can become powerful, engaged citizens who participate in civic life despite their skepticism of existing institutions. To make this possible, we need to broaden our understanding of what it means to be a good citizen.

There is a tendency to assume that the actions that constitute good citizenship are stable over time. Good citizens inform themselves about issues, vote in elections, contact representatives about issues they care about and, if they fail to be heard, protest peacefully and non-violently. Michael Schudson argues that this model of citizenship is only one of several that has held sway in the US at different moments in our nation’s history. Early in the American republic, “good citizens” would be expected to send the most prominent and wealthy member of their community to Washington to represent them, independent of agreement with his ideology. Later, good citizens supported a political party they affiliated with based on geography, ethnicity or occupation. The expectation that voters would inform themselves on issues before voting, vote on split tickets making decisions about individual candidates or vote directly on legislation in a referendum was the result of a set of progressive era reforms that ushered in what Schudson calls “the informed citizen”.

We tend to see the informed citizen as the correct and admirable model for citizenship a hundred years after its introduction, but we miss some of the weaknesses of the paradigm. Informed citizenship places very high demands on citizens, expecting knowledge about all the candidates and issues at stake in an election – it’s a paradigm deeply favored by journalists, as it places the role of the news as informing and empowering citizens at the center of the political process. Unfortunately, it’s also a model plagued with very low participation rates – Schudson observes that the voting was cut nearly in half once progressive political reforms came into effect. And while we often discuss civics and participation in terms of the informed citizen mode, he argues that America has moved on to other dominant models of citizenship, the rights-based citizenship model that centers on the courts, as during the civil rights movement, and monitorial citizenship, where citizens realize they cannot follow all the details of all political processes and monitor media for a few, specific issues where they are especially passionate and feel well-positioned to take action.

Young people in particular are looking for ways they can be most effective in making change around issues they care about. Effective citizenship, in which individuals make rational, self-interested decisions about how they most effectively participate in civic life, can look very different from the informed citizenship we’ve come to expect. Joe Kahne and Cathy Cohen surveyed thousands of youth in California and discovered that while participation in “institutional” politics (rallies, traditional political organizing, volunteering to work with a candidate) is low, there is strong engagement with they are volunteering at a much higher rate than previous generations, looking for direct, tangible ways they can participate in their communities.

We are beginning to see new forms of civic participation that appeal to those alienated from traditional political processes. One way to understand these methods is as levers of change. When people feel like they are unlikely to move formal, institutional levers of change through voting or influencing representatives, they look for other levers to make movement on the issues they care about.

In his 1999 book, Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, Lawrence Lessig argues that there are four primary ways societies regulate themselves. We use laws to make behaviors legal or illegal. We use markets to make desirable behaviors cheap and dangerous ones expensive. We use social norms to sanction undesirable behaviors and reward exemplary ones. And code and other technical architectures make undesirable actions difficult to do and encourage other actions. Each of the regulatory forces Lessig identifies can be turned into a lever of change, and in an age of high mistrust in institutions, engaged citizens are getting deeply creative in using the three non-legal levers.

In the wake of Edward Snowden’s revelations of widespread NSA surveillance of communications, many citizens expressed fear and frustration. The Obama administration’s review of the NSA’s programs made few significant changes to domestic spying policies. Unable to make change through formal government processes, digital activists have been hard at work building powerful, user-friendly tools to encrypt digital communications like Signal, Center for Civic Media.)

Effective citizenship means that people look for the methods of social change they see as most effective. Young people often look for norms-based theories of change, taking advantage of their skills in building and disseminating media. Insurrectionists frustrated with legal institutions or with the behaviors of corporate America look for change through new technology and new ventures.

This shift in citizenship is still emerging. Media often hasn’t caught up with the idea that effective civic engagement happens outside the courts, the voting booth and Congress. This understandable overfocus on law-based theories of change leaves those frustrated with institutions frustrated with media as well. For insurrectionists who see Washington institutions as ineffective and untrustworthy, a strong media focus on these institutions can look like an attempt to maintain their legitimacy and centrality.

One of journalism’s key roles in an open society is to help citizens participate effectively. From close scrutiny of those in elected office to analysis of legislative proposals to editorial endorsements of candidates for office, news outlets help their customers make civic decisions. If mistrust in institutions is changing how people participate in civics, news organizations may need to change as well. We can recommit ourselves to explaining the importance and centrality of our institutions, but we run the risk of being insufficiently skeptical and critical, and the danger that we lose even more trust from our alienated and insurrectionist readers. Or we could rethink our role as journalists as helping people navigate this emergent civic landscape and find the places where they, individually and collectively, can be the most effective and powerful.

Shortly after the 2016 elections, a friend asked me to lunch. A Trump supporter, he knew we had voted differently in the election, and we both wanted to talk about the future of the country under the new administration. But he invited me specifically because he was angered by an article I’d written that grouped Breitbart founder Steve Bannon with alt-right leader Richard Spencer.

My friend explained that he read Breitbart religiously, not because he supports white supremacy, but because he supports net-zero immigration to the US as a strategy for raising the incomes of white and non-white Americans. Breitbart was the only major media outlet he found seriously discussing that policy stance. “If Bannon is beyond the pale, and Breitbart’s beyond the pale, does it mean that my views on immigration are beyond the pale? And what about the millions of Americans who agree with me?”

Research that Yochai Benkler and our team at MIT and the Berkman Center confirmed my friend’s assertion that Breitbart covered matters of immigration much more closely than other media outlets leading up to the 2016 election, focusing on the issue more than 3x as often as right-leaning outlets Fox News and the Wall Street Journal. Thanks to the strong influence of Breitbart, we speculate, immigration became the most-reported on policy issue in the 2016 election, despite GOP efforts to soften the party’s stance on immigration to reach Latino voters.

The move of immigration from the fringe of the news agenda to a central topic is a phenomenon addressed by media scholar Daniel Hallin in his 1985 book, The Uncensored War: The Media and Vietnam. Hallin argues that we should think of potential news stories as fitting into one of three spheres. In the sphere of consensus, there is widespread agreement on an issue or a position (democracy is the best form of government; capitalism is a good way to build an economy) and therefore it’s not worth our time to discuss. In the sphere of deviance, there is widespread agreement that a stance is beyond the pale (sexual relationships between adults and minors are natural and should be legal; collective ownership of all goods is the best way to end economic inequality) and also not worthy of discussion. The (sometimes very narrow) sphere of legitimate controversy includes the standard political debates within a society, and journalists are expected to show themselves as neutral on those topics legitimate to debate (tax cuts for the wealthy will lead to economic growth; for-profit insurers will only survive with federally mandated medical insurance).

Lobbyists, activists and PR professionals have used Hallin’s spheres to shape what’s at stake in public policy debates. Health insurance companies have worked hard to push the idea of single payer healthcare into the sphere of deviance, rebranding the idea as socialized medicine to associate it with a disfavored economic idea. By citing the small number of scientists who do not see evidence that humans are contributing to climate change, advocates have kept the phenomenon of global warming within the sphere of legitimate debate.

While Hallin’s Spheres are related to the Overton window – the idea that certain policy prescriptions are so radical that a politician could not embrace them without compromising her own electability – being consigned to Hallin’s sphere of deviance has psychological implications that falling outside the Overton window lacks. Advance a policy suggestion that is outside the Overton window and you suffer the disappointment that your idea is discarded as impractical. Stray outside the sphere of legitimate debate into the sphere of deviance, and your position becomes invisible to mainstream media dialog. Journalism scholar Jay Rosen observes, “Anyone whose views lie within the sphere of deviance — as defined by journalists — will experience the press as an opponent in the struggle for recognition. If you don’t think separation of church and state is such a good idea; if you do think a single payer system is the way to go… chances are you will never find your views reflected in the news. It’s not that there’s a one-sided debate; there’s no debate.”

The growth in media diversity brought about by the rise of the internet and social media means that if your ideas are outside the sphere of legitimate debate, you can simply find a media sphere where you’re no longer in the sphere of deviance. My friend, frustrated that he could not find media debating his ideas on immigration, began reading Breitbart, where his deviant ideas are within the sphere of consensus, and the legitimate debate is about the specific mechanisms that should be used to limit immigration. He is not alone. While less popular than during the 2016 election, Breitbart is the 61st most popular website in the US, close in popularity to the Washington Post. In our data set, which examines how websites are shared on Twitter or Facebook, Breitbart is the fourth-most influential media outlet, behind CNN, The New York Times and politics site The Hill.

The ability to find a set of media outlets compatible with your political views is not new. Even in the days of political pamphlets and early newspapers, it was possible to experience a Federalist or Anti-Federalist echo chamber. The rise of large-circulation newspapers and broadcast media, which needed to avoid alienating large swaths of the population to maintain fiscal viability, led us into a long age where partisan journalism was less common. Even as cable news made partisan news viable again, broadcast news networks and major newspapers maintained aspirations of fairness and balance, attempting to serve the broader public.

Those economic models make little sense in a digital age. As purveyors of wholly manufactured fake news (like the Macedonian teens who targeted content at Trump supporters) know, there is a near-insatiable appetite for news that supports our ideological preconceptions. But it’s important to consider that people seek out ideological compatible media not just out of intellectual laziness, but out of a sense of efficacy. If you are a committed Black Lives Matter supporter working on strategies for citizen review of the police, it’s exhausting to be caught in endless debates over whether racism in America is over. If you’re working on counseling women away from abortion towards adoption, understanding how to be effective in your own movement is likely to be a higher priority for you than dialog with pro-choice activists.

Partisan isolationism is not just purely a function of homophily. The structure of internet media platforms contributes to ideological isolation. While Pariser and others trace these structural effects to Facebook and other highly targeted social media, I argued in Rewire that three different generations of internet media have made it possible to self-select the topics and points of views we are most interested in. The pre-Google web allowed us to self select points of view much as a magazine rack does: we choose the National Review over the Nation, or their respective websites. Unlike broadcast media, which lends itself towards centrist points of view to attract a wide range of ad dollars, narrowcast media like websites and magazines allow more stark, partisan divisions. With the rise of search, interest-based navigation often led us to ideological segregation, either through the topics we select or the language we choose to pursue them – the vegan cooking website is unlikely place to meet conservatives, much as searching for progressive voices on a hunting site can be frustrating. And the language we use to describe an issue – climate change, global warming or scientific fraud – can be thoroughly ideologically isolating in terms of the information we retrieve.

What’s different about social media is not that we can choose the points of view we encounter, but that we are often unaware that we are making these choices. Many people joined Facebook expecting the service would help them remain connected with family and friends, not that it would become a primary source of news. As of 2016, 62% of American adults reported getting some news via social media, and 18% reported often getting news through platforms like Facebook. These numbers are more dramatic for young adults, and likely increased during the 2016 presidential election. Because Facebook’s newsfeed algorithm presents content to you based on content you’ve liked and clicked on in the past, it has a tendency to reinforce your existing preconceptions, both because your friends are likely to share those points of view, and because your behavior online indicates to Facebook what content you are most interested in. Eli Pariser calls this problem “the filter bubble”, building on earlier work done by Cass Sunstein, which recognized the tendency to create “echo chambers” online by selecting media that fits our politics. Pariser argues (controversially) that algorithms used by Facebook and others increase this tendency.

It’s worth noting that the filter bubble problem isn’t inherent to social media. Twitter has pointedly not filtered their timeline, which avoids the filter bubble, but leaves responsibility for escaping echo chambers to the user. While you can decide to follow a different group of people on Twitter, research from Nathan Matias suggests that even highly motivated people are unlikely to make major changes in their online behavior in order to combat biases and prejudices.

Our team at the MIT Media Lab is working on Gobo, a new tool that allows you to filter your Facebook and Twitter feeds differently, using natural language processing and machine learning to build filters that can increase or decrease the political content of your news feed, give you more or fewer female authors, or consciously choose to encounter more news outside of your echo chamber. One of the key questions we seek to answer in buiding the tool is whether people will actually choose to use these filters. One hypothesis we hope to disprove is that, despite complaining about filter bubbles, many people seem to enjoy ideological isolation and may choose settings similar to what they encounter online now.

General interest media, like broadcast television and national newspapers, traditionally saw themselves as having a responsibility to provide ideological balance, global perspectives and diversity in their coverage. (Whether they succeeded is another question – I’ve heard many reports from people of color that they felt invisible in those “good old days” and far more visible in contemporary, fragmented media.) As that business model becomes less viable, because readers gravitate towards ideologically compatible material, it’s worth asking whether platforms like Facebook have an appetite for this work.

Thus far, the answer seems to be no. Facebook has assiduously avoided being labeled a publisher, trying to ensure both an escape from legal liability for content it hosts under the Safe Harbor provisions of US internet law, and to prevent itself from being criticized about exercising poor editorial judgement. The problems Facebook is confronted with are serious. Demands that the platform block “fake news” are challenging, given that most of what’s called “fake news” is not obviously fraudulent. If Facebook begins blocking platforms like Breitbart, it will be accused of censorship of political content, and rightly so.

One possible escape for Facebook is to eliminate algorithmic curation of newsfeeds, moving back to a Twitter-like world in which social media is a spray of information from anyone you’ve chosen to pay attention to. Another is to adopt a solution like the one we are proposing with Gobo, and put control of filters into the user’s hands. It’s an open question whether Facebook would choose a path forward that gives its users more control over their experience of the service.

In considering how platforms enable online discourse, we need to consider the idea that sharing content is a form of civic participation. Part of our emergent civics is the practice of making and disseminating media designed to strengthen ties within an identity group and to distinguish that group from groups that oppose it. Consider the meme-makers competing for $20,000 from Infowars. Many involved don’t believe that CNN is ISIS, as one popular meme alleges – as Judith Donath explains, “News is shared not just to inform or even to persuade. It is used as a marker of identity, a way to proclaim your affinity with a particular community.”

Donath’s insight helps explain why factchecking, blocking fake news or urging people to support diverse, fact-based news is unlikely to check the spread of highly partisan news. Not only is partisan news comfortable and enjoyable (I find it reassuring to watch Trevor Noah or Samantha Bee and assume that friends on the right feel the same watching Fox News commentators), spreading this information has powerful social rewards and gives a sense of shared efficacy, the feeling (real or imagined) that you are making norms-based social change by shaping the information environment.

The research Benkler and our Media Cloud team conducted shows how rapidly these partisan ecosystems can come into being. Examining 1.25 million media stories and 25,000 media sources, we gave each media source a partisanship score based on whether people who shared tweets from the Democratic or Republican candidates also shared a story from a source. Stories from the New York Times were more often shared by people who’d retweeted Hillary Clinton than those who’d retweeted Donald Trump, but the effect was much more pronounced with Breitbart: Breitbart was amplified almost exclusively by Trump supporters. Our research shows a tightly clustered set of sites read only by the nationalist right. The vast majority of these sites are very new, most founded during the Obama administration. This community of interest has very little overlap with traditional conservative sources like the Wall Street Journal or the National Review. In our study, those publications are both low in influence and linked to by both the left and right, while the Breitbart-centered cluster functions as an echo chamber.

The emergence of echo chambers like the one around Breitbart further complicates fact-checking. danah boyd explains that in teaching students not to rely on Wikipedia, we’ve encouraged them to triangulate their way to truth from Google search results. On topics covered heavily in the Breitbartosphere but not addressed in the broader media universe, this leads to a perverse effect. Search for information on Pizzagate as the story was being developed on sites like Infowars and you would likely find links to other far-right sites promoting the story. By the time sites like the New York Times became aware of the story and began debunking it, many interested in the faux-scandal had persuaded themselves of its truth through repetition within a subset of closely related websites, to the point where an unstable individual took up arms to “self-investigate” the controversy.

Hallin’s spheres suggests we question whether we are encouraged to discuss a wide enough range of topics within the sphere of legitimate controversy. The problem we face now is one in which dialog is challenging, if not impossible, because one party’s sphere of consensus is the other’s sphere of deviance and vice versa. Our debates are complicated not only because we cannot agree on a set of shared facts, but because we cannot agree what’s worth talking about in the first place. When one camp sees Hillary Clinton’s controversial email server as evidence of her lawbreaking and deviance (sphere of consensus for many on the right) or as a needless distraction from more relevant issues (sphere of deviance for many on the left), we cannot agree to disagree, as we cannot agree that the conversation is worth having in the first place.

Much as there is no obvious, easy solution to countering mistrust in institutions, I have no panaceas for polarization and echo chambers. Still, it’s worth identifying these phenomena – and acknowledging their deep roots – as we seek solutions to these pressing problems. It is worth noting that the research Benkler’s and my team carried out suggests the phenomenon of asymmetric polarization – in our analysis, those on the far right are more isolated in terms of viewpoints they encounter than those on the far left. There’s nothing in our research that suggests the right is inherently more prone to ideological isolation. By understanding how extreme polarization has developed recently, it might be possible to stop the left from developing a similar echo chamber. Our research also suggests that the center right has a productive role to play in building media that appeals to an insurrectionist and alienated right-leading audience, which keeps those important viewpoints in dialog with existing communities in the left, center and right.

Fundamentally, I believe that the polarization of dialog in the media is a result both of new media technologies and of the deeper changes of trust in institutions and in how civics is practiced. The Breitbartosphere is possible not just because it’s easier than ever to create a media outlet and share viewpoints with the like-minded. It’s possible because low trust in government leads people to seek new ways of being engaged and effective, and low trust in media leads people to seek out different sources. Making and disseminating media feels like one of the most effective ways to engage in civics in a low-trust world, and the 2016 elections suggest that this civic media is a powerful force we are only now starting to understand.

I want to acknowledge that this paper may stray far from the immediate challenges that face us around issues of information quality, in the service of seeking for their deeper roots. My questions follow in the same spirit. For the most part, these are questions to which I don’t have a good answer. Some are active research questions for my lab. My fear is that we may have to address some of these underlying questions before tackling tactical questions of how we should best respond to immediate challenges to faith in journalism.

Trust: – How long does it take to recover trust in an institution that has failed? What are examples of a mistrusted institution regaining public trust? – Is the fall in institutional trust an independent or a joint phenomenon – i.e., does losing trust in Congress lessen our trust in the Supreme Court or the medical system – Is trust in news media higher or lower in countries with strong public/taxpayer supported media? Does trust correlate positively or negatively to ad support? Privacy-invading tracking and targeting? – If people don’t trust institutions, who or what do they trust? How do those patterns differ for more trusting elites and for the broader population?

Participation: – What forms of participation (from the traditional, like voting, to the non-traditional, like making CNN-bashing memes) are indicators of future civic engagement? Should we be encouraging and celebrating a broader range of civic participation amongst youth? Amongst groups that see themselves alienated from conventional politics? – Should media attempt to explain and engage audiences more deeply in institutional politics? Will acknowledging the limits of existing institutional politics restore trust in journalism, or damage trust in government? – Should media celebrate and promote new forms of civic engagement? Will this further decrease trust in institutions? Increase a sense of citizen efficacy? – What would media designed for increased public participation look like? Are there models in the advocacy journalism space, or in solutions journalism, constructive journalism or other movements?

Polarization: – Is it reasonable to expect Americans to rely on a single, or small set, of professional media sources that report a relatively value-neutral set of stories? Or is this goal of journalistic non-partisanship no longer a realistic ideal? – Could taxpayer-sponsored media serve a function of anchoring discourse around a single set of facts? Or will public media be inherently untrustworthy to some portion of American voters? Why does public media seem to work well in other low-trust nations but not in the US? – Is there a role for high-quality, factual but partisan media that might reach audiences alienated from mainstream media? – Should media outlets learn from what’s consensus, debatable and deviant in other media spheres and modify coverage to intersect with reader’s spheres? Is shifting the boundaries of these spheres part of how civics is conducted today?",mainstream
938,"LONDON (Reuters) - Arsenal host Manchester United on Sunday in a clash crucial to both clubs as they try to finish the season in the top four of the Premier League.

We look at five standout matches between the clubs.

The animosity between the clubs could perhaps be traced back to this fixture at Old Trafford, when the result was largely forgotten following a mass brawl that resulted in both teams having points deducted by the FA.

Arsenal, who went on to win the title, scored the only goal, but Anders Limpar’s effort was largely irrelevant after all but one of the 22 players on the pitch were involved in an unseemly second-half melee.

Arsene Wenger’s ‘Invincibles’ claimed their place in footballing history after going the entire season unbeaten in 2003-04, but their run should have ended as early as September.

Manchester United’s Ruud van Nistelrooy slammed a stoppage-time penalty against the bar and was confronted by five Arsenal players in ugly scenes at the final whistle, with Martin Keown hurling himself — chest first, arms spread — at the Dutch striker, who looked genuinely worried for his safety.

It was perhaps fitting that Arsenal’s stunning unbeaten run was ended after 49 games by United at Old Trafford with Ruud Van Nistelrooy’s penalty and a late goal by Wayne Rooney.

Arsenal completely lost their cool in an intimidating atmosphere and events spiralled out of control in the tunnel afterwards in what became known as “Pizzagate”.

While the exact details remain sketchy, a food fight allegedly broke out with United manager Alex Ferguson hit in the face by a flying pizza slice.

“This slice of pizza came flying over my head and hit Fergie straight in the mush,” former Arsenal player Ashley Cole recalled. “The slap echoed down the tunnel and everything stopped — the fighting, the yelling, everything.”

So soon after “Pizzagate” the build-up to the return league clash resembled that of a heavyweight title fight.

This time tempers reached boiling point before kickoff with United’s Roy Keane and Arsenal’s Patrick Vieira appearing to square-up with referee Graham Poll stepping between the two midfield warriors.

A tempestuous game followed with Vieira putting Arsenal ahead, Ryan Giggs levelling and Dennis Bergkamp restoring Arsenal’s lead before the break.

Cristiano Ronaldo struck twice after the break before Mikael Silvestre was sent off for United but John O’Shea sealed the points late on with a lob.

The teams’ rivalry under managers Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger had been typified by tight, edgy and sometimes explosive encounters, but their meeting early in the 2011-12 season was anything but as Arsenal suffered their worst defeat since 1927.

United put on a ruthless attacking exhibition with Wayne Rooney scoring a hat-trick, Ashley Young netting twice and Danny Welbeck, Nani and Park Ji-sung also on target.

It was Manchester City who went on to win the title, though, on a dramatic final day of the season.",mainstream
591,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

In January, Andrew Richmond, a co-founder of a Toronto-based chain of ice cream shops called Sweet Jesus, started receiving strange online comments and phone calls.

Conspiracy theorists littered the Instagram and Facebook accounts of Sweet Jesus with accusations and menacing comments, pointing to the chain’s name, brand iconography and advertising featuring children. They posted the shop’s advertisements to their own social media accounts and tagged them #PedoGate. Others took their campaign offline, calling the company’s shops and threatening employees.

“People were saying that we were pedophiles and the Illuminati,” Richmond said. “I wish I were part of the Illuminati. Don’t they run the world? I’m just selling ice cream.”

The worst of it was over within a week, Richmond said.

“We were willing to say who we are and what we stand for, that it’s innocent,” Richmond said. “I realized we were winning the battle of reasonableness here.”

Sweet Jesus isn’t the only business that has been the target of an online conspiracy theory. Voodoo Doughnut, a popular chain based in Portland, Oregon, has received similar calls in recent weeks.

“They’re very persistent,” said Eamon Monaghan, a manager at the company’s downtown Portland store, adding that calls were coming in hourly claiming, “we know what is happening at your place.”

“We’re trying to firmly but politely say this isn’t a thing and carry on with our business and ignore it,” Monaghan said.

The harassment comes from a group of fervent online conspiracists who have been targeting private businesses and individuals with harassment campaigns and accusations of being involved with child-sex trafficking rings.

Sparked by a video posted on a popular YouTube conspiracy channel, the group, whose members are also largely followers of the Qanon conspiracy theory, has flooded Voodoo’s Instagram and Facebook posts and left Yelp reviews accusing the owners of child sex trafficking. Last week, the chain’s original Portland outpost received more calls from conspiracy theorists than customers ordering doughnuts, Monaghan said.

The group is fueled in part by a website called Big League Politics, a far-right media outlet that often publishes conspiracy content and has been used to raise funds for prominent Republican politicians. Some of the website’s stories appear to be sourced from a secret message board created by a Big League Politics staffer, in which members concoct elaborate, pedophilia-based conspiracy theories they hope will be published to a wider audience.

The harassment campaigns highlight how conspiracy theories that form in deep corners of the internet can have real-world consequences. The same theory that led conspiracists to Sweet Jesus and Voodoo Doughnut previously focused on Comet Ping Pong, a Washington pizza shop where a man fired a rifle in 2016 during a ""self-investigation"" of online rumors that a child-sex ring was being run out of its basement. The shop has no basement.

Monaghan said he refers callers to the Portland Police Department. Sgt. Chris Burley, a department spokesman, said that “an enormous” number of emails and calls had been made to the department asking why they aren’t investigating Voodoo Doughnut.

Burley said a detective had looked into the situation but that the so-called whistleblower, who made the allegations against Voodoo Doughnut in the widely shared video that was ultimately deleted by YouTube, failed to cooperate.

“The lead investigator has repeatedly attempted to contact the person who made these allegations and has not heard back,” Burley said. “We take these allegations seriously, but when the complainant won’t come forward with information, it’s difficult for us to continue.”

“Based on what we have seen, there is no information to suggest that any of the allegations against Voodoo are credible,” the sergeant said.

The baseless allegations are being lobbed daily by self-described “patriot researchers."" Their harassment of Voodoo Doughnut and Sweet Jesus are just part of a larger war — waged on Twitter and in private groups on Facebook and Discord, a gaming-focused online chat program — against the politicians, celebrities and businesses they claim are part of a global conspiracy to harm children.

Their paranoia is partly fueled by Big League Politics, which has published articles that glorify the anonymous peddlers of the Qanon conspiracy theory and promote unfounded allegations that the Democratic National Committee had ordered and covered up the 2016 murder of staffer Seth Rich.

Run by former Breitbart News reporter Patrick Howley, who often writes the website’s most conspiracy-oriented content, Big League Politics has amassed a readership that prominent Republicans and their supporters have increasingly found attractive. Among the groups and GOP politicians that have used the Big League Politics email list to fundraise this year are the National Republican Congressional Committee; House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana; Rep. Devin Nunes of California; and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

When reached for comment, spokespeople for Scalise and Cruz said their campaigns would no longer work with Big League Politics and would return any money raised with the outlet.

The Nunes campaign and the NRCC did not respond to a request for comment.

Big League Politics writer Haley Kennington, who posts several stories a day on the site, appears to source some of her stories from a secret message board she created in July dubbed “Pedo Takedown Crew,” which was recently discovered by NBC News.

A staff writer for Big League Politics since May, Kennington often covers general pro-Trump news items, but has increasingly focused on a more specific beat — writing stories about what she calls “pedophilia-related” social media posts from liberal-leaning celebrities.

On the message board, hosted on the video game-focused social media network Discord, Kennington and some 40 self-described “researchers” crowdsource what they claim are pedophilia investigations. Members of the group have shared maps of “underground tunnels” that they speculate run between elementary schools and small businesses for child sex trafficking. Kennington has asked her team to investigate Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey and Beyoncé, among others.

Kennington recruited members to her group by posting invitations in private Qanon chatrooms, according to Discord logs viewed by NBC News. “Need help digging,” she wrote to her new group members in July. “Drop what you can find here. Links to any Nambla, pedo/child trafficking/organizations, $, connections. You know what to do.”

At Kennington’s request, others in the group have posted maps of Voodoo Doughnut locations alongside the city’s plumbing system, local schools, public transit network, and airports, suggesting a possible method of smuggling children in or out of the sweets shop.

“Small submarines arent (sic) out of the realm of possibility,” offered one member.

Kennington initially declined to speak to a reporter on the phone, but responded to emails by requesting a list of questions that she said she would answer. She did not reply to those questions. On Tuesday, Kennington asked on Twitter whether NBC News was “Compliant” or “Involved” in pedophilia.

When asked about Kennington’s “Pedo Takedown Crew” group, Howley, the editor-in-chief of Big League Politics, called the message board a “research operation,” but said he hadn’t heard of the group until NBC News asked about it.

“I think you are attacking a research community that I haven’t heard about to defend the doughnut shop. Have you been to the doughnut shop?” Howley said. “Are you associated with [Voodoo Doughnut] in some way?”

After an NBC News inquiry into the channel, Kennington kicked out half of her members. While it is unclear whether the channel is still operating, as of Monday, the discussions remained active, with various users posting links and maps associated with Voodoo Doughnut’s Portland location.

On Aug. 9, Discord user Zach1616 posted a note to the Voodoo Doughnut channel of Pedo Takedown Crew.",mainstream

During a recent net the team took some time out to help themselves to some fast food on the Headingley outfield.

Whether MS Dhoni is a McDonald's man or Suresh Raina prefers a Nando's is as yet unkown.

What is for sure though is that they aren't the first sportsmen to make the headlines for their dabbling with food.

Here's five more cases of culinary chaos in sport:

Possibly the most high-profile slice of football-related food shenanigans came back in 2006.

With the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United at boiling point a scuffle broke out in the tunnel afterwards.

During the dust up a slice of pizza was hurled at then boss Sir Alex Ferguson hitting him square in the face.

Earlier that year another Italian food was the cause of the problem for Tottenham.

With the team on the verge of the Champions League Spurs suffered a final day defeat to West Ham handing rivals Arsenal the all-important spot.

The club went on to blame a dodgy batch of lasagna although the London Marriott allegedly responsible have since been cleared of any wrongdoing.

Fresh from helping England secure qualification for the 1998 World Cup Gascoigne looked set to be a key figure in France.

However, he was later pictured scoffing a kebab just a week before the final squad was picked.

Boss Glenn Hoddle left Gazza at home and he never played for his country again.

The most famous diet in Olympic history was eaten by perhaps the most famous Olympian.

Usain Bolt revealed in his autobiography that he tucked into as many as 100 Chicken McNuggest a DAY.

It didn't do him any harm though - the Jamaican sprint king won individual gold in both the 100m and 200m.

Former England wicketkeeper Jack Russell earned himself a reputation as one of the oddest eaters in sport.

He was a big fan of tea, drinking 20 cups a day at times, often brewed with the same teabag, and also Weetabix which he apparently soaked for exactly eight minutes with mashed banana.

It wasn't all tea and cereal though - Russell apparently spent every night of one Test at a Chinese restaurant in Perth ordering cashew chicken without the cashews.",mainstream

They had common interests—international politics, making fun of journalists—and a shared comic sensibility that borders on nihilism but stops just short of it. Christman, stout and Midwestern, had been unemployed for years, moving around the country with his wife, an academic librarian. Biederman was a freelance writer and mixed-martial-arts hobbyist in New York City. Menaker was an assistant editor at Liveright, an imprint of W. W. Norton.

800,"A pedophile, who proudly displayed his “pizzagate” tattoos on Instagram, was finally removed from the platform after a flurry of reports concerning his pictures and hashtags indicating that he was not only a sodomite, but a pedophile. The tattoos also demonstrate that all those symbols from the Pizzagate scandal are indeed real (Newsguard should get a clue, but they are too busy trying to discredit those reporting real news).

So, I came across this post from Erin Marie RN on Facebook.

The post contained photos of a man known on Instagram as kage_jackson and showed several tattoos that indicate that he is a sodomite “boy lover.”

Reported to Instagram, but I guess it’s okay to be a self-proclaimed pedofile (see his hashtags) and it does not go against “community standards.”

Protect your kids with everything in your power.

 They are normalizing this disgust.

72,"This article is more than 3 years old.

Bullshit, James Ball tells me, can get you into the Oval Office.

The former Guardian journalist and now special correspondent at BuzzFeed is well versed in separating fact from fiction.As a young reporter fresh out of university he started as an intern at WikiLeaks, working on the verification and publication of confidential US documents in 2010, and then on the Snowden leaks in 2013 during his time at The Guardian.

That’s all to say he’s developed a sixth sense for what is, and isn’t, bullshit.

With this in mind, today Ball is publishing his debut book as a solo author on the fake news phenomenon which has engulfed the world of politics over the last year.

We sat down with Ball to find out how half-truths, untruths and outright fakery took over:

Fake news, post-truths and bullshit, is this a new phenomenon?

This definitely isn't new: newspapers have run questionable stories for as long as they've existed, and fake news has circulated the web for just as long.

But things have changed a bit – fake news got political last year, because that was the way to get huge audiences.

So it's some old trends that have suddenly really come to the fore.



So who's to blame for fake news?

Russia! More seriously – all of us.

Fake news is just the most visible bit of what is a whole ecosystem of half-truths, untruths and outright fakery, or in other words, of bullshit.

When we share a story without thinking about it or checking, we're part of that system. When a hyper-partisan news site (think Breitbart or The Canary) over-hypes and spins a kernel of truth into something much bigger, that's part of it.

When mainstream outlets run too-good-to-check stories, they're part of it. And when Facebook and others profit off this whole system, they're part of it too.

Are there examples of fake news causing real harm?

The Pizzagate conspiracy – an alt-right theory that pizza parlours were harbouring secret child abuse sites used by leading democrats – led to an armed man storming a DC pizza parlour.

So the consequences of this stuff can be very real.

Polling shows Republicans believe Obama wiretapped Trump (there's no evidence he did), while many Democrats believe US election machines themselves were hacked (there's no evidence of this either).

When we all believe different facts, we can't have a public conversation – we can only have a shouting match.

So what's the solution? Will we ever be free of fake news?

The upside of all of us being part of the problem is that we can all be part of the solution.

We need to find ways to make corrections reach as many people as the initial bad reports and hoaxes do. We've got to find new ways to cover politicians and campaigns which deploy bullshit to win. There's no one big fix, but there's lots of little things all of us can do.

The fightback can start whenever we like.

770,"Sir Alex Ferguson's glittering career is set to be given the red carpet treatment as US film gurus reveal they want to document his life in a movie.

Former USA and New York Cosmos star Werner Roth has the idea to base a cinema blockbuster, based on 2011 book ‘Sir Alex Ferguson - The Official Manchester United Story Of 25 Years At The Top’.

The book was co-written by David Meek and Tom Tyrell, with Meek confirming that contact has been made about the possibility of a future film.

“The idea is very much in its early stages. But obviously it could be a fascinating portrayal of an exceptional man,” Meek told The Sun.

Despite the book not being updated to document the retirement of Ferguson in 2013, the film would undoubtedly include his story right until the end of his career.

It would likely highlight the key moments of his time at United, including the 1999 Champions League final and possibly Pizzagate.

Roth believes that the movie would be a worldwide success thanks to the global appeal of United and Fergie's legacy.

Beginning in 1986, the story would begin with Ferguson being named as manager of the Red Devils, following his appointment from Aberdeen.

It would progress through time and feature the rise of United as they became one of the most formidable forces in world football.

Brian Clough is another former manager to have his career documented via film, with 'The Damned United' becoming one of the most popular football films of all time.",mainstream
414,"When Anna Wiener first moved to San Francisco for a job at a web analytics startup, she rented a room on Airbnb and found herself captivated by the idea of living amid another person’s belongings – their toothpaste, their soap. “I liked examining someone else’s product selections, judging their clutter,” she writes of her brief stay in an apartment that, she learns, was owned by one of Airbnb’s founders. “I wasn’t thinking about how the home-sharing platform might also be driving up rents, displacing residents, or undermining the very authenticity that it purported to sell.”

The passage is an apt description of the book itself, a memoir that presents itself as an outsider’s look at Silicon Valley – a jaded naif’s journey into the heart of venture capital. Wiener was a 25-year-old member of the New York literary establishment’s “assistant class” when she was seduced into the world of startups. In tech, she realised, people her age could be involved in building the future instead of fetching coffee for the quickly receding past.

After the web analytics startup, she moved to (the unnamed but barely disguised) open-source platform GitHub, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2018 for $7.5bn. Before she burns out and cashes in her stock options, our narrator gets an education in the world as imagined by confident and careless young men, or, as she puts it, “immersion therapy for internalised misogyny”. Wiener’s judgments are cutting and satisfyingly wry. “They engaged with their new home by rating it,” she writes of her fellow tech workers in San Francisco. Incisive commentary on the aesthetic excesses of the successful abound; the book’s first half unfolds like an exquisitely curated Tumblr blog, with a scroll of beautifully juxtaposed snapshots of the young, newly wealthy and utterly absurd.

It’s in the second half that the book feels frustratingly, and at times startlingly, thin. Wiener’s admission that she did not like to think about the societal implications of her choices is inadequate, and the degree to which aesthetic judgments supersede ethical or moral considerations grows wearying. Her friendship with a billionaire CEO coyly identified as “Patrick” (that would be 31 year-old Patrick Collison, CEO of payments company Stripe) offers an opportunity for her to lay her political cards on the table, but she largely refrains. In 2018, Collison’s company gave more than $400,000 to oppose a local business tax that would have funded services for the city’s homeless. In the book, his gravest transgression is having a birthday party in the woods but not sticking around to camp out.

San Francisco’s large homeless population is impossible to ignore. During her tenure at GitHub, Wiener describes observing a homeless man wearing a hooded sweatshirt branded with the company’s logo while on her way to work. (The encounter is not the first time our narrator has remarked on the visual dissonance of a person in poverty wearing tech industry swag.) Wiener admits to feeling “disturbed” by the sight of the beggar for the rest of her commute. “The man seemed like a novelistic apparition, a hallucination,” she writes. She tells a co-worker: “It was the city’s socioeconomic gap personified, I said. It felt even more significant that the man in the light-rail station was black, and not just because San Francisco was losing its black population at a rapid clip. To my knowledge, the company had just two black employees.” The co-worker deems the situation “sad”, then adds: “I wonder whose it was … We’re not supposed to give away the hoodies.”

What are we to make of moments such as these? I can see how this might be intended as another cutting observation of the clueless tech bro in his habitat, but 200 pages in, I found myself struggling to swallow bitter ironies about human suffering as eagerly as I had witty remarks about bespoke cocktails and startup office furnishings. The amoral cocoon within which Wiener and the rest of the tech industry reside is pierced with greater frequency as the book proceeds towards the November 2016 election. Discrimination in the workplace, antisemitic trolling, Gamergate, structural racism and sexism become topics of concern, but not ones that she shows particular interest in engaging with. They are instead presented through the same approximate frame as the homeless man in the hoodie – as problems that make Wiener feel uncomfortable; opportunities for irony not empathy. When a repository of files related to the debunked anti-Hillary Clinton Pizzagate conspiracy theory spread by the far right shows up on GitHub’s servers, she shrugs. “I didn’t know what I was looking at, and didn’t want to. My teammates seemed to have it under control.”

They didn’t have it under control. These days, amid the consequences of the surveillance, harassment campaigns, discrimination, extremism and nihilism that the tech industry fostered, it is natural to wonder how we got here, and why more people haven’t done anything to stop it. It is here, perhaps, that the book feels less like an outsider’s account and more like an insider’s unwitting confession.

993,"Taylor Swift's new album has already been the subject of much online fretting after its release date was set for November 10 - the anniversary of the death of Kanye West's mom.

But even that bizarre claim of hyper-vindictive psychopathy comes up short next to the accusations being made by online conspiracy theorists.

They include claims that Swift's eerie marketing alternately proves that she is a space-faring snake-mother, a clone of herself, and an insider in Pizzagate - a conspiracy so preposterous that even Alex Jones said it was wrong - Wired reported.

In the lead-up to the announcement of her album, Swift, 27, posted a string of cryptic videos and images.

They included a series of Tweeted videos showing segments of a snake, concluding with the snake's head. The music video for Swift's first single, Look What You Made Me Do, also features snake imagery.

That, apparently, is all it takes to kick-start a string of crazy conspiracy theories.

ParamoreFanClub, who frequents Reddit's Conspiracy chat boards, offered up this insight: 'For weeks I've been saying Taylor swift gave birth to a reptilian baby the. She tweets this?

'This isn't a coincidence... We haven't seen an actual picture of her for months now(due to the pregnancy). Reptiles are going mainstream, the end is near.'

When questioned, they added: 'kim kardashian is a well known lizard, and the snakes and lizards have been going at it for years. trump is a snake and the clintons are lizards(they were friends until recently)'.

A secret society of lizards controlling human civilization has been a feature of fiction and theory since non-fiction writer Maurice Doreal described a race of serpent-people in a 1940s pamphlet - and was popularized by David Icke in the 1980s.

Kim Kardashian being a lizard creature is a new one, however, and it's unclear what the continuing Kanye/Swift clashes would mean for reptilian civilization.

Swift could also just be reclaiming the snake symbol used against her on Twitter, of course.

That symbol proliferated after Kardashian revealed she'd taped a phone call in which Taylor told Kanye he could use lyrics about her; lyrics she later denounced online.

But 'mother of a space serpent' is more fun.

YouTube user Truthneversleeps doesn't go that far, mark you - he merely identifies the snake as Swift's occult god, not a symbol of her demon-spawn child.

'This woman is a representation of death,' he says, breathlessly, having previously identified a series of lines across her dress in another music video as looking like the' eye in the pyramid' symbol associated with the Illuminati.

Pausing one of her snake video Tweets at a point where the snake's body jitters - as thought it were on a broken old VHS cassette - he spots a horned face in the CGI scales.

'Here, folks, is a demon,' he says, indicating something that is not a demon. 'Because this is who she worships.'

He points out what he sees as eyes, mouth, nose and horns in the shadows in the scales.

'No denying it, so that was a cryptic message in this little... this little video thing.'

He then skips over her other snake videos, saying 'I bet if I paused it at certain areas we would see more subliminal messaging. I didn't really worth with this one too much, but it's all there folks.'

The continues in that vein for another 15 minutes, pointing out Swift's 'evil eye of Horus' (her eye), her clothing's 'Illuminati-type pyramids' (triangles), and a necklace that indicates 'she is a slave to the Satanic system' (it's a choker).

Others identified as Satanic agents are Buzz Aldrin, Ashley Graham, Bella Hadid, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Cash Me Outside girl and 'Satanic shapeshifter Miley Cyrus'.

If you've been lucky enough to somehow avoid Pizzagate, here's a primer: It's nuts.

In slightly more detail, it's theory that says a pizza shop in Washington, DC, was used as a hub for a child trafficking ring run by high-ranking Democrats - a claim so absurd even Alex Jones has apologized for promoting it.

But some alt-right conspiracy fanatics are clinging onto every last crumb of Pizzagate - and believe Swift is too, according to a thread on 4chan's right-wing politics board.

An anonymous user posted up a 2009 photo of her standing next to a man with a swastika on his shirt - a man who told TMZ it was painted on him during a party - and claimed she was 'our girl' due to her use of a Gothic font, favored by neo-Nazis.

More likely, the font on her album's cover was designed to mimic the masthead of The New York Times - in line with the cover's newspaper theme.

Another user claimed that the lyrics 'I don't like your games, Don't like your tilted stage' are about how 'Taylor, being a white, blonde haired, blue eyed woman is made to be an object of hatred and degredation by the jews.'

They also claim that the line 'I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me, I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams' translates to 'The Jews call us Nazis no matter what we do simply because we're white. Now, we will give them Nazis.'

Other users say that a section of her new music video in which a series of spiraling snakes represent Pizzagate - spirals supposedly representing pedophilia, according to conspiracy theorists).

Those snakes then shattering into triangular shards in turn mean that 'Pizzagate is unraveling, and spiraling out of the globalist's control,' according to another user.

They then say the use of yellow is used 'as a reference to goodness or righteously exercised power.

'The full-screen worldwide flash of yellow means the globalists are losing control of their mind control apparatus. Their poison cloud is about to dissipate.'

So either Taylor Swift is one of the ruling serpent class, or she's fighting the system. Or perhaps there's a civil war among the mind-controlling Illuminati snake people; #TeamSwift or #TeamKimye - which lizardly puppet-master group will you choose?

In a slightly more mundane theory, Taylor Swift is not Taylor Swift, but a second version (Twolor Swift?) used to replace the original, who has been murdered for not following orders from... someone.

Swift maintained Twitter silence in the run-up to the release of her new album, and while sheeple would assume that's because she was just chilling and finally taking a break from hr otherwise relentless self-promotion, others see the truth.

The truth being that Swift is the latest in a long line of dead pop stars to have been replaced by identical-looking identically talented duplicates.

A_D_D_I_C_T, another Reddit conspiracy fan wrote: 'Is she already dead and replaced? Failure to comply, she wanted to keep her self, so they killed her and replaced her.

'This has been done before with Miley Cyrus as the notable example,' they wrote. 'She was told to flip her image and become a whore but didn't want to so they killed her and replaced her.'

When questioned, they elaborated: 'A common strategy with celebrities is to allow them to do their ""own thing"" (what they believe is their own) until the time comes to use them for a more overt purpose.

'Those that don't obey are murdered and replaced.'

'Miley was killed prior to a new album and subsequent whore tour,' he theorized.

That's not helped by a line in the middle eight of Look What You Made Me Do in which Swift intones: 'I'm sorry but the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Oh, 'cause she's DEAD.'

If true - and what about this story sounds false? - Swift and Cyrus will join a mile-high pile of expired pop stars, including Avril Lavigne and, most famously, Paul McCartney.

Although after the PR disaster that was her relationship with Tom Hiddleston, perhaps being replaced by a clone would come as pleasant relief.",mainstream
349,"When it comes to pedophilia in Hollywood, it’s not a secret anymore. Multiple famous child actors like Elijah Wood have spoken up about this problem that plagues the industry. Corey Feldman, one of the biggest childhood actors of all time, said that pedophilia is “the biggest problem in Hollywood.” This is an issue that is tied to a great deal of power, and it seems some very powerful people are involved and that’s why the issue continues to occur.

Smallville actress Allison Mack, for example, was recently arrested for her involvement in a “sex cult,” a few months after these revelations, billionaire Clare Bronfman was indicted on racketeering charges. These charges were connected to her role as “Operations Director” for NXIVM (the sex cult that Mack was involved in and arrested for). Clare Bronfman is the daughter of Charles Bronfman, a Canadian/American businessman and philanthropist.

Why don’t these wealthy elite ever face consequences? Was mack just the “fall” person? The Bronfman family has been referred to as the “The Rothschild’s of the New World” by author Peter C. Newman, a well-known Canadian journalist and writer. The Bronfman family has also been in business with the Rothschild family for quite some time. One of many examples is their wealth management company, Bronfman Rothschild.

All of these people are connected to enormous amounts of power and wealth.

Then we have the case of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who has very close ties to global elitists, actors, actresses, politicians and the royal family. In more recent news, U.S. Attorney Byung “B.J.” Pak of the Northern District of Georgia asked a federal judge for a 60-day period to consult with Epstein’s victims, followed by a lengthy briefing schedule that, according to lawyers for two of the victims, could delay justice for months if not longer. These victims all mention high profile people, ones that Epstein has been seen publicly with on many occasions, like Prince Andrew. In this article, you can see a picture with one of Epstein’s accusers with Prince Andrew, as well as one with Andrew and Epstein.

Steve Pieczenik is a former high ranking United States Department of State official and a Harvard trained psychiatrist, he had this to say about the Clintons and Epstein’s plane, known as the “The Lolita Express.”

“We know that both of them have been a major part and participant of what’s called The Lolita Express, which is a plane owned by Mr. Jeff Epstein, a wealthy multi-millionaire who flies down to the Bahamas and allows Bill Clinton and Hillary to engage in sex with minors, that is called Pedophilia.”

The point is, all of this stuff is well known, and not long ago, along came Isaac Kappy. Kappy has been in Hollywood circles, not as a huge star but he’s been there. He was in Thor and Terminator: Salvation, among other hit films and did a lot of writing. Approximately a year ago, he began speaking up about Hollywood sex cults and pedophilia, and he named a lot of names like Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Seth Green and many many more.

These videos are all over Youtube. At the same time he began speaking out, many mainstream outlets all of sudden, like TMZ, were publishing weird information about him, like the idea that he was supposedly involved in abusing and choking Paris Jackson, a former good friend of his, for example. It was weird to say the least, especially given the fact that it happened when he began to share what he was sharing. Again, you can find many of his videos about that all over Youtube.

The latest news on Kappy is quite sad, as it appears he has passed away. It’s being reported that he recently jumped off a bridge in Arizona and committed suicide. Apparently, several witnesses were around and tried to stop him from doing so.

Kappy is not the only one who has been vocal about these issues, apart from the examples above, there are people like the example below as well.

1343,"Muse’s The Handler is one of the most obvious music videos about Monarch mind control ever created. However, it takes some basic knowledge on the subject to understand the true meaning of the video. Here’s a closer look at The Handler.



Muse’s lead singer Matt Bellamy was never a stranger to themes relating to the occult elite and mind control. The band’s 2009 album The Resistance contained titles such as Uprising and MKULTRA which alluded obscure topics relating to conspiracy theories. After the success of that album, Muse obtained some music industry recognition, participated in the 2012 Olympics Closing Ceremonies (which were a big occult elite ritual – read my article about it here) and, since then, the band’s message somewhat shifted. Indeed, Matt Bellamy went from stating in 2006:

to flip-flopping on the subject in 2012 :

These kinds of statements, combined with a more subdued second album lead fans to wonder if the band “sold out” to the music business.

However, the band’s latest album, Drones, brings Muse back to its “Resistance” roots and goes even further down the rabbit hole. Drones is indeed a concept album that “follows the protagonist’s journey from abandonment to indoctrination as a “human drone” and eventual defection”.

Matt Bellamy described Drones as an album about the dehumanization of modern warfare:

The sixth song of the album, entitled The Handler, describes the protagonist’s indoctrination … and this indoctrination is clearly accomplished through Monarch mind control (if you don’t know what I’m referring to, read this article first). The vocabulary of the song and the symbolism of the video could not be clearer, making The Handler one of the clearest references to Monarch programming in popular culture to date. Let’s look at the video.

The song is about an MK slave singing to his handler. Right from the start, the lyrics refer to trauma-based mind control.

The handler was first the “oppressor” as he subjected the slave to unbearable pain, torture, and trauma in order to induce dissociation. Once that is accomplished, the oppressor becomes the “handler” who programs an alter-persona that can be controlled at will.

In the video, a shady figure in a black hood plays the role of the handler. He’s sticking out of a strange structure which appears to be the brain of the slave. While the handler acts as the master of ceremonies, symbolic images rotate around the slave’s brain. All of them refer to Monarch programming – and many of them are actual MK trigger images.

Another item waltzing in front of the handler is a teddy bear. Plush toys and pets are often given to slaves so they can bond with them and get some comfort … have them live the trauma of losing a loved one. We’ll later see how this plays out in the video.

The lyrics of the song mention the key steps of Monarch programming. The chorus alludes to the ultimate goal of Monarch programming: dissociation.

After being subjected to intense trauma and torture, MK slaves are pushed towards dissociation – it is a natural defense mechanism of the brain when faced with unbearable trauma. After dissociation, handlers have “access” to the slave’s brain and can create programmable alter-personas.

The second verse of the song relates to the state of the slave after programming.

Trance Formation of America is one of the first books ever to reveal the Monarch mind control system used by the occult elite. In her biography, O’Brien writes:

The rest of the second verse describes the powerlessness of a programmed MK slave who cannot help but obey the handler’s orders. The slave is a stranger in his own mind.

The third verse is about the slave rebelling and attempting to break from his programming.

However, like most stories about Monarch programming, victory is mere illusion.

The Handler is one of the most blatant music videos about Monarch mind control in popular culture. However, contrary to other MK-themed pop videos described on this site, the narrative of Muse’s story does not glorify Monarch programming, it goes against it. Does that mean that, despite being signed to a major label, Muse is anti-elite and anti-establishment?

Well, that’s not clear. As stated in an article in Pseudo-Occult media, there’s a duality that permeates the message and the symbolism of Muse’s works. On one hand, some of their work has a rebellious and revolutionary message but, on the other hand, the band ultimately just adds more occult elite noise in mass media, albeit with a slightly different perspective. While the symbolism of The Handler could not be clearer for someone who knows about Monarch mind control, it still goes way above the heads of regular viewers (read the YouTube comments of the video, you’ll understand).

In the end, the work of Muse accomplishes what symbolism does best: It reveals to those in the know and conceals from those who are not. For this reason, it is up to us to be vigilant citizens and understand what mass media is trying to sell us. Otherwise, we will turn into drones who are controlled by other drones.",conspiracy
568,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Two right-wing activists that Ohio Republican Josh Mandel defended this summer against labeling by an anti-hate group have launched a super PAC backing his bid for U.S. Senate.

Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec are among founders of the #Rev18, for Revolution 2018, political action committee launched Monday.

Both men were involved in the conspiracy theory dubbed “pizzagate,” which suggested Hillary Clinton was running a pedophile ring out of a pizzeria.

A third partner, entrepreneur Jeffrey Giesea, told Cleveland.com that it likes Mandel’s style and message.

“He is bringing a new type of energy to the Republican Party that we want to see in 2018,” he told the news organization, noting the 40-year-old Mandel’s relative youth and “America-first” agenda.

A message was left Tuesday with Mandel’s campaign seeking comment on the Super PAC’s plans to support him. It is prohibited from coordinating with his campaign, but can raise and spend unlimited amounts on his behalf.

Mandel, Ohio’s state treasurer, retweeted a Twitter post by Cernovich in July that accused the Anti-Defamation League of “inciting terrorism” with a report identifying members of the “alt-right” and “alt-lite” movements.

It identified Cernovich and Posobiec as “alt-lite,” which the ADL defines as rejecting overtly white supremacist ideology, but embracing misogyny and xenophobia.

Mandel is making his second consecutive bid to unseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, this time around employing some of the campaign tactics used successfully by GOP President Donald Trump.

Cleveland businessman Mike Gibbons, former Ohio co-chair for Trump, is challenging Mandel in the Republican primary.

His campaign disagreed with the PAC’s assertion that Mandel is offering something new.

Spokesman Chris Schrimpf said Gibbons is making inroads among Ohio grassroots groups “because he’s the only serious candidate in the race who isn’t a career politician.”

He said Brown has been in office for 40 years and Mandel, who has run for office seven times in the past 14 years, has spent “his entire adult life” as a politician.

Mandel also did two tours with the Marines in Iraq.

Mandel’s tweet in July cast the League’s identification of a list of key figures in the right-wing factions energized by Trump’s election as politically slanted labeling.

869,"As we watch Donald Trump take on the most powerful position in the world, many of us are left asking how a man who has consistently lied to his public could get so far.

Some pundits are calling this the dawn of a new era. They say we now live in a post-fact or post-truth world. This is a time where the emphasis is not on coherence or rationality but on sensationalism, no matter the cost. And of course, this phenomenon has a concrete influence in the way we envision and govern our world.

But scientists have another word for “post-truth”. You might have heard of epistemology, or the study of knowledge. This field helps define what we know and why we know it. On the flip side of this is agnotology, or the study of ignorance. Agnotology is not often discussed, because studying the absence of something — in this case knowledge — is incredibly difficult.

Agnotology is more than the study of what we don’t know; it’s also the study of why we are not supposed to know it. One of its more important aspects is revealing how people, usually powerful ones, use ignorance as a strategic tool to hide or divert attention from societal problems in which they have a vested interest.

A perfect example is the tobacco industry’s dissemination of reports that continuously questioned the link between smoking and cancer. As one tobacco employee famously stated, “Doubt is our product.”

In a similar way, conservative think tanks such as The Heartland Institute work to discredit the science behind human-caused climate change.

Despite the fact that 97% of scientists support the anthropogenic causes of climate change, hired “experts” have been able to populate talk shows, news programmes, and the op-ed pages to suggest a lack of credible data or established consensus, even with evidence to the contrary.

These institutes generate pseudo-academic reports to counter scientific results. In this way, they are responsible for promoting ignorance.

Agnotology has always been present, but it is transforming. Now, the goal is no longer to create ignorance, because there is little to no preoccupation in public media with determining the validity of knowledge.

Under agnotology 2.0, truth becomes a moot point. It is the sensation that counts. Public media leaders create an impact with whichever arguments they can muster based in whatever fictional data they can create.

In the past it took powerful people, billionaires or major corporations, to generate significant levels of doubt; now, with social media, anyone can provide counter-factual information to create doubt.

This was nowhere more evident than in the case of “pizzagate”: in early December a man drove from North Carolina to a pizzeria in Washington DC, to verify whether children were being trafficked by Hillary Clinton and other leaders as part of an underground sex ring. He shot a rifle in the air, scaring the pizzeria’s workers and customers. The man was arrested, but the restaurant’s owner has been the subject of harassment, all because of tweets peddling false information.

Group cohesion based on fear is not conducive to open-minded discourse and problem-solving. More and more, ignorance-induced fear is a sure bet for stoking xenophobia and populism.

The separation of facts from opinions in recent discourse dominated the American presidential election. Facts no longer mattered, and Donald Trump’s many lies and contradictions did not affect his popularity. Any publicity was good publicity.

As the question of “why” hangs over Trump’s inauguration, we are left to wonder about the effects of having too much information at our fingertips. Perhaps we are inundated with so much information that we cannot decipher it all. Or perhaps it takes too much time and effort to verify information as factual.

Perhaps change in how news is brought to the public leads to irresponsible reporting. Or our education system might lack training in critical thinking. Probably, it is a mix of all of these things and more.

Donald Trump entering the White House is the pinnacle of agnotology 2.0. Washington Post journalist Fareed Zakaria has argued that in politics, what matters is no longer the economy but identity; we would like to suggest that the problem runs deeper than that.

The issue is not whether we should search for identity, for fame, or for sensational opinions and entertainment. The overarching issue is the fallen status of our collective search for truth, in its many forms. It is no longer a positive attribute to seek out truth, determine biases, evaluate facts, or share knowledge.

Under agnotology 2.0, scientific thinking itself is under attack. In a post-fact and post-truth era, we could very well become post-science.",mainstream
479,"Police searching for a Wisconsin man considered armed and dangerous stepped up patrols on Sunday at churches near his home because of anti-religious views expressed in a manifesto he sent to U.S. President Donald Trump, officials said.

Joseph A. Jakubowski, 32, is wanted for breaking into a gun shop called Armageddon Supplies in his home town of Janesville, about 110 kilometres southwest of Milwaukee, on Tuesday, when several handguns and rifles were stolen, according to the Rock County Sheriff's Office.

Later that night, his truck was found nearby engulfed in flames, the Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Police believe Jakubowski torched the truck.

Investigators who analyzed the manifesto were also concerned about ""anti-religious views"" in the document, which Jakubowski can be seen mailing to Trump in a video posted to social media.

As a precaution, law enforcement officers increased their patrols at local churches and other places of worship on Sunday but no disturbances were reported, the Rock County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

At least one Wisconsin church shut its doors. Bethlehem Lutheran in Sun Prairie, less than 80 km north of Janesville, cancelled services after a man who was believed to resemble Jakubowski visited the church on Thursday. Investigators have not verified if it was Jakubowski.

A force of 150 law enforcement personnel, including Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, continued their manhunt for Jakubowski on Sunday.

Jakubowski, who served time in prison for trying to wrestle a gun away from a police officer, is believed to have become agitated about politics recently, authorities said.

A person who knows Jakubowski said he had spoken of his plans to steal guns and stage some kind of attack, possibly at a school, Spoden said.

It was unclear if Jakubowski, who according to local media was unemployed, remains in Wisconsin or if he had left the state. Federal agents were pursuing leads in other parts of the country.

1068,"Although Maître Gims is barely known in the U.S., he is kind of a big deal in Europe. His last two albums reached number one in France and in Belgium and peaked at the top 40 of various European countries such as Denmark, Italy, and Switzerland. In 2018, his hit single La Même made him the most played artist on French radio and television while becoming the 7th most played artist worldwide on Deezer. This notoriety allowed Gims to work with several international artists such as Sia, Pitbull, Lil Wayne, J Balvin, Maluma, Sting, Stromae, and others. Gims now owns his own record label (named MMC), which is affiliated with Universal Music France.

So did all of this success come at a cost? According to his video Le Prix à Payer (which stands for The Pice to Pay): Yes, big time. Indeed, the video depicts, in a highly symbolic manner, the price to pay to become successful in the music industry. And it is all about shutting up and obeying the occult forces that rule it.

Here’s a look at the video.

The video begins with Gims sitting in a waiting room with men dressed similarly. A mysterious woman dressed in black and red (the favorite colors of the occult elite) walks to him.

The woman takes Gims to a board room that contains some rather symbolic elements.

To add to the symbolism of the scene, these frames are hung on the pillars of the rooms – symbolically indicating that the occult elite that “holds the weight” of this industry.

The record exec then hands Gims his record contract. To sign these papers, Gims is not offered a pen … but a knife.

This is not a simple business contract. It is a blood oath. It is a staple in occult circles and involves dire prices to pay if the oath is broken.

The first verse of the song aptly describes Gims’ situation. Here’s a rough translation:

After signing the contract with blood, Gims’ new life begins.

In this scene, Gims symbolically leaves his family to enter the crazy world of the elite. And, at first, it seems really great.

As the elite’s newest recruit, Gims’ career takes a sudden turn for the best. Also, we realize that Gims has zero input over his image or his career. He’s become a pawn.

Like all industry pawns, Gims has to partake in every single promotional stunt that is planned out for him.

My series of articles Symbolic Pics of the Month often feature photoshoots of artists doing occult elite stuff (i.e. the one-eye sign). Readers often ask who tells these artists to keep doing this stuff. The answer: Industry-chosen photographers are a big part of the equation.

When the photographer gets a little too pushy, Gims’ limo driver tells him to back off.

After all of these emotions, Gims needs a break. And the limo driver has exactly what he needs.

So, obviously, this is product placement. It is not satirical and it is not a “commentary” about fame. It is a real product placement paid by The Coca-Cola Company to Universal Music Group. And Gims had to hold that bottle and drink it. In short, this weird scene basically confirms that Gims is not truly “rebelling” against anything. He is still very much part of that system.

After this refreshing Fanta break, Gims continues his meteoric rise to success.

Although Gims appears to be living the dream, he is not.

The scar is a representation of the never-healing “wound” that comes with selling one’s soul. And Gims realizes that being a celebrity is not all fun and games. Those who control him actually do not care about him and use him in whatever way they feel fit.

After all of the shenanigans, things get real.

However, one cannot just leave the industry without any repercussions. There are repercussions.

Luckily for Gims, one of the hooded men hands him a knife, allowing him to free himself and run away. However, that probably means that his music career is over. However, in real life, his actual music career is still alive and well. So, what does that mean?

Le Prix à Payer is one of the most blatant exposures of the music industry and its dark side ever created. It depicts several elements that were discussed on this site for years such as the oath required while signing a record contract, the lack of control of artists over their own careers and image, the prevalence of the one-eye sign and the all-importance of occult rituals and sacrifices.

Judging by the comments about this video on YouTube, many believe that this video is actually a call for help. Indeed, the song lyrics convey regret and powerlessness while the video depicts a reluctant artist going through the motions of being an industry pawn.

While the video shows a clear desire to break free from it all, it also contains elements that indicate that this is not actually happening. For instance, that weird Fanta product placement screams out: “This video was sponsored by the Coca-Cola Company”. Most artists hate seeing their work compromised by such shameless advertising and it is often imposed by the record company. On the other hand, one might say: Kudos on getting paid while exposing the industry.

If the video actually exposes the record industry, why was it allowed by this major, elite-owned label? Well, first, the video is cartoony enough to fictionalize the entire subject. Second, the elite actually wants to reveal some part of itself to the masses. And it wants us to know that, if you cross it … there’s a price to pay.

65,"SPOKANE, Wash. -- Nearly two decades after the Aryan Nations' Idaho compound was demolished, far-right extremists are maintaining a presence in the Pacific Northwest.

White nationalism has been on the rise across the U.S., but it has particular resonance along the Idaho-Washington border, where the Aryans espoused hate and violence for years.

The neo-Nazi group was based near Hayden Lake, Idaho, starting in the 1970s, and eventually was bankrupted in a lawsuit brought by local activists and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Its compound was seized, and supporters dispersed.

But a series of incidents in recent weeks show far-right sentiments never really left the conservative region. In the county that is home to Hayden Lake, for instance, Republicans last month passed a measure expressing support for U.S. entry of a prominent Austrian far-right activist who was investigated for ties to the suspected New Zealand mosque gunman.

In 2018, at least nine hate groups operated in the region of Spokane and northern Idaho, including Identity Evropa, Proud Boys, ACT for America and America's Promise Ministries, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The center does not track how many members belong to each group.

Keegan Hankes, a researcher for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the number of hate groups is growing across the U.S., driven in part by a toxic political culture. The human rights group counted 784 active hate groups in the U.S. in 2014 and 1,020 in 2018.

In particular, white supremacist groups are growing because of fears that the country's racial makeup is changing. ""That drives a ton of anxiety,"" Hankes said.

These new far-right activists are more scattered than the ones who used to gather at the Aryan Nations by the dozens, experts say.

""It is no longer necessary to go to a compound in Hayden Lake, Idaho,"" said Kristine Hoover, director of the Gonzaga Institute for Hate Studies in Spokane.

With the proliferation of social media, groups ""form in dispersed locations"" and gatherings are ""more covert,"" she said.

In late April, a self-described ""American Nationalist"" named Brittany Pettibone appeared at a meeting of Kootenai County, Idaho, Republicans to ask for help to bring her boyfriend, Martin Sellner, to the country from Austria. Pettibone, 26, said Sellner wants to marry her and live in Post Falls, Idaho.

Pettibone was a big promoter of the hoax known as ""Pizzagate,"" telling her online followers Hillary Clinton and other high-profile Democrats were involved in satanic rituals and child sex trafficking tied to a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant.

Sellner is a leading figure in the extremist ""identitarian"" movement, which espouses a white nationalist ideology and has swept over Europe amid an influx of migrants and refugees. He has confirmed he exchanged emails with the suspected New Zealand shooter, who donated money to Sellner's group. But Sellner denies involvement in the attack.

Despite his background, the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee passed a resolution urging the federal government to allow Sellner into the United States. The resolution said the government revoked Sellner's travel privileges ""for political reasons,"" and demanded those privileges be reinstated.

Faced with criticism for giving Pettibone a platform, Kootenai County GOP Chair Brent Regan blamed the press. ""In its lust for scandal, the media has stretched the committee's simple act of kindness into headlines that are too bizarre to be fiction,"" he wrote in a recent op-ed.

Also last month, The Guardian published internet chats from 2017 in which a Washington state legislator and three other men discussed confronting ""leftists"" with a variety of tactics, including violence, surveillance and intimidation.

The messages prompted Washington House Democrats to demand that the Republican lawmaker, Rep. Matt Shea of Spokane Valley, be reprimanded for a history of far-right speech and activities. While Shea did not propose violence, he did not speak up when violence was proposed, Democrats said.

House Republican Leader J.T. Wilcox of Yelm responded that Shea should not be punished before investigations are completed. The House, led by Democrats, will conduct an independent investigation of the lawmaker.

Shea, who rarely speaks to reporters, did not return numerous messages from The Associated Press.

He has served in the state House since 2008, introducing bills to criminalize abortion and roll back gun laws and pushing for eastern Washington to secede from the rest of the state. The military veteran attracted international attention in 2018 after a document he wrote laid out a ""biblical basis for war"" against people who practiced same-sex marriage and abortion, and instructed: ""If they do not yield, kill all males.""

In a third case, a nationwide arrest warrant was issued in May for a Stevens County, Washington, man who allegedly tried to extort members of his right-wing militia group through anonymous written threats backed by insinuations they came from a Mexican drug cartel.

James ""Russell"" Bolton, 51, faces at least six charges of extortion and attempted theft after he was arrested recently in West Virginia.

Stevens County detectives believe he was responsible for a series of anonymous threatening letters delivered to members of the group. The letters purported to come from a Mexican cartel and demanded large sums of cash in exchange for protection.

Hoover, the Gonzaga professor, said it is a mistake to consider all of the above as separate incidents.

""These are movements,"" Hoover said, noting participants are not doing this alone. ""They have interconnectedness over the internet.""",mainstream
755,"In her first in-depth interview ever, Paris Jackson revealed that she was abused at age 14, the she tried to commit suicide several times and that she is absolutely sure that her father Michael was murdered.

Paris Jackson’s interview with Rolling Stone magazine caused some stir due to the disturbing nature of some revelations. While she is only 18 years old, Paris has seen and been through awful things that were often associated with the dark side of the entertainment industry.

In 2013, Paris was sent to a “treatment center” following her suicide attempt where she reportedly “cut her wrists with a kitchen knife and took as many as 20 ibuprofen tablets.” In my article about this story, I shared some of Paris’ social media posts where she alluded to occult rituals and secret societies.

The conclusion of that article was:

Fast-forward to today, things apparently got better for her, but the “dark forces” of the industry are still within arm’s reach. Paris’ feature in Rolling Stone included pictures by one of the elite’s favorite photographer: David LaChapelle. As expected, the pictures are charged with symbolism.

The picture is reminiscent of Christian iconography.

The symbol of the lightning bolt is esoterically associated with Lucifer due to the fact that he’s described as a “fallen angel” who descended from the heavens to earth … like a lightning bolt. Therefore, the combination of Christian iconography with the bolt results in a typical study in duality. Typical David LaChapelle imagery.

From Paris’ answers in the interview we understand a few things: She’s a product of the industry, she has been traumatized by it and she apparently holds some insider information.

At the beginning of the article we learn about Paris’ fascination with the morbid and celebrity deaths.

Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson is staring at a famous corpse. “That’s Marilyn Monroe,” she whispers, facing a wall covered with gruesome autopsy photos. “And that’s JFK. You can’t even find these online.” On a Thursday afternoon in late November, Paris is making her way through the Museum of Death, a cramped maze of formaldehyde-scented horrors on Hollywood Boulevard. It’s not uncommon for visitors, confronted with decapitation photos, snuff films and serial-killer memorabilia, to faint, vomit or both. But Paris, not far removed from the emo and goth phases of her earlier teens, seems to find it all somehow soothing. This is her ninth visit. “It’s awesome,” she had said on the way over. “They have a real electric chair and a real head!”

Paris then reveals that she has attempted suicide several times.

Paris describes herself as “desensitized” to even the most graphic reminders of human mortality. In June 2013, drowning in depression and a drug addiction, she tried to kill herself at age 15, slashing her wrist and downing 20 Motrin pills. “It was just self-hatred,” she says, “low self-esteem, thinking that I couldn’t do anything right, not thinking I was worthy of living anymore.” She had been self-harming, cutting herself, managing to conceal it from her family. Some of her tattoos now cover the scars, as well as what she says are track marks from drug use. Before that, she had already attempted suicide “multiple times,” she says, with an incongruous laugh. “It was just once that it became public.” The hospital had a “three-strike rule,” she recalls, and, after that last attempt, insisted she attend a residential therapy program.

Without going into details, she divulges that she was abused by a complete stranger who was much older.

Was she in contact with powerful Hollywood child abusers? Is this why she “didn’t tell anybody”?

Paris also said that she was convinced that her father Michael was killed.

Paris blames Dr. Conrad Murray – who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in her father’s death – for the dependency on the anesthetic drug propofol that led to it. She calls him “the ‘doctor,'” with satirical air quotes. But she has darker suspicions about her father’s death. “He would drop hints about people being out to get him,” she says. “And at some point he was like, ‘They’re gonna kill me one day.'” (Lisa Marie Presley told Oprah Winfrey of a similar conversation with Michael, who expressed fears that unnamed parties were targeting him to get at his half of the Sony/ATV music-publishing catalog, worth hundreds of millions.) Paris is convinced that her dad was, somehow, murdered. “Absolutely,” she says. “Because it’s obvious. All arrows point to that. It sounds like a total conspiracy theory and it sounds like bullshit, but all real fans and everybody in the family knows it. It was a setup. It was bullshit.” But who would have wanted Michael Jackson dead? Paris pauses for several seconds, maybe considering a specific answer, but just says, “A lot of people.” Paris wants revenge, or at least justice. “Of course,” she says, eyes glowing. “I definitely do, but it’s a chess game. And I am trying to play the chess game the right way. And that’s all I can say about that right now.”

Strange fact: After learning about Paris’ 2013 suicide attempt, Conrad Murray, who is serving a four year prison sentence, sent Paris a creepy “support” message stating:

These words are coming from the guy WHO IS IN PRISON FOR KILLING HER FATHER.

Paris also added that she was scared for Justin Bieber who works with the same promoters as Michael Jackson at the time of his death.

Less than 24 hours after the release of this interview, Paris was swarmed by paparazzi at LAX which caused her to break down and run away.

She then posted on Twitter that she wants to be left alone.

Let’s hope she stays away from the vultures of the entertainment industry.",conspiracy
1212,"Fake news is nothing new in the movies: Column

The new biopic Jackie is the latest in a genre of films that fits well into our post-fact, fake-news era. We see Mrs. Kennedy talking to a priest who is made up of whole cloth, notes Eric Eidelstein of Mic. We see her staggering “in a druggy haze through the East Wing, sipping vodka,” says The Washington Post’s Ann Hornaday. ""Of course it's all fiction; of course it's a fantasy,"" writes The Boston Globe's Ty Burr.

That doesn't mean it shouldn't been seen. But it does revive the perennial debate around films such as JFK and Selma that both capture and distort important slices of history, and in that respect it is a disturbing echo of today’s news environment.

In 1989, I had a front-row seat to the filmmaker's dilemma — not simply whether to depict historical events authentically or take liberties for the sake of drama, but also whether to defend your decision. It involved Mississippi Burning, which had ignited controversy for glorifying the FBI and inaccurately depicting the murders of civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner. I asked British director Alan Parker to appear on ABC’s Nightline (I was the chief guest producer) to explain his portrayal of one of the horrific moments in this country's civil rights era. He declined, but the public relations firm hired by the movie surprisingly offered up the film's star, Gene Hackman (who was nominated then for an Oscar for best actor).

It seemed an odd substitute. Anyone familiar with Nightline knew it was not just another stop on the film promotion circuit but a serious public policy program, often featuring debates on headlines of the day. During the broadcast, civil rights pioneer Julian Bond wasted little time in confronting Hackman, who was appearing remotely from a Chicago TV studio. ""People are going to have a mistaken idea about that time,"" Bond told Hackman, and suggested a better name for the film might be Rambo meets the Klan. Bond also criticized the portrayal of the FBI and the South: ""It's just wrong. These guys were tapping our telephones, not looking into the murders of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner.""

All Hackman could say in response was, ""I would apologize for making people feel uncomfortable. But I still think it's a good film.""

Within seconds of us getting off the air, the phone rang in the green room. It was Hackman, who laced into me for making him a punching bag. Even though nearly 30 years have passed, I vividly recall responding as politely as I could: ""Mr. Hackman, the person you should be upset with is not me or anyone on Nightline, but your public relations person, who knew this was a debate about whether a filmmaker should remake history.""

All of this seems rather quaint in the new age of fake news on the Internet. When demonstrably false news inspires a person to take a semiautomatic weapon into a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., as happened this month, and fire several shots because that pizza joint had been at the center of false stories about a child sex ring, it's no longer a theoretical classroom discussion.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Besides a casual relationship with the truth, historical movies that bend facts for dramatic effect share at least one thing with fake news on the Internet: Both present a challenge for young people to tell fact from fiction. I've gone into classrooms in the Washington area as part of a program to beef up news literacy for students. There is a lot of work to be done in helping students with the tools to distinguish between reliable information from trusted sources and unreliable and completely fanciful stories.

With a tsunami of information washing into our phones, tablets and laptops, it's a bit like emptying the ocean with a teaspoon. But we have to start somewhere. While we can't control people who are determined to send out false and defamatory stories, whether their motives are click bait, thrills or a political agenda, we can ask the entertainment industry to police itself and treat history with a bit more reverence on the big screen. Then, perhaps, the truth will hold some value for the next generation.

Ruwan Wijewardene, Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister whose ministry is responsible for the island's police force, said the death toll had been revised down to 253 due to inaccurate figures provided by the country's morgues.

119,"THE bizarre theory has crept from the dark web into colourful Q banners held at mass Trump rallies.

But what is the pro-Trump conspiracy theory and how big is its following? Here's everything we know about the mysterious movement.

Qanon is a conspiracy theory that has taken hold among some Trump supporters.

According to NBC, the theory centres around an anonymous source, Q, who is trying to tell the world a secret - or multiple secrets.

These centre around unfounded allegations that Donald Trump and special counsel Robert Mueller are waging a secret battle against an alleged paedophile ring.

Supporters of the entirely unfounded theory believe that this ring is filled with celebrities and political elites, who have been covertly running the United States government for decades.

The theory gained more press coverage after a supporter held a vast letter Q at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania in August 2018.

Last month, an armed Qanon follower blocked traffic at the Hoover Dam, demanding the president release a report allegedly tying past presidents Obama and Clinton to the alleged sex ring.

How did it start?

The bizarre theory originated in December 2016, when Edgar M.Welch entered a Washington D.C. pizza parlour and demanded to see a basement that did not exist.

According to NBC, he believed the restaurant was part of a child sex ring, a conspiracy known as Pizzagate.

The US news site reports that eight months later, a person going by ""Q"" posted for the first time on the anonymous politics message board 4chan, known to be a hotbed of conspiracy talk.

Since his first message, which involved Hilary Clinton, Q posted nearly 1,800 messages.

Followers try to decipher these nonsensical posts, with some of Trump's most loyal supporters using them as a way to explain away any scandal the President might face.

Jared Holt, a research associate for Right Wing Watch who has followed the growth of Qanon, said: All of Trump’s mishaps on the world stage, his detractors in the media, his various scandals can all be effectively be framed within the Qanon lore as attacks that are coordinated against him because he’s ever closer to taking down a global conspiracy committing the most atrocious crimes that could be imagined, like Satanic child sex trafficking, and blood sacrifice.""

Most of the deadlines mentioned in Q's posts have been and gone, with all shown to be unfounded.

How big is its following?

The bizarre theory has gained cult status among some followers, with Q-related products such as T-shirts, mugs and jewellery available.

And conservative celebrities such as Roseanne Barr and Curt Schilling have also referenced its existence, giving it yet more press coverage.

The conspiracy theory has since been debunked, however, as a fourth image — which shows a news anchor reporting on “corona virus” — was revealed to be photoshopped. In fact, that still hails from a different episode entirely.

The culprits behind the misleading collage also lifted a scene from “Marge in Chains,” which sees an Asian character cough into a package addressed to Homer Simpson.

“I don’t like it being used for nefarious purposes,” Oakley told the Hollywood Reporter of the episode he cowrote with Josh Weinstein. “The idea that anyone misappropriates it to make coronavirus seem like an Asian plot is terrible. In terms of trying to place blame on Asia — I think that is gross.”

In the actual episode, the packager, who is working in Japan, transmits an illness deemed the “Osaka flu.” According to Oakley, the scene in Japan was “supposed to be a quick joke about how the flu got there,” and nothing more.

“It was meant to be absurd that someone could cough into a box and the virus would survive for six to eight weeks in the box. It is cartoonish,” Oakley told THR. “We intentionally made it cartoonish because we wanted it to be silly and not scary, and not carry any of these bad associations along with it, which is why the virus itself was acting like a cartoon character and behaving in extremely unrealistic ways.”",mainstream
1166,"If there is one thing that’s consistent about Donald Trump, it’s that he is horribly inconsistent. Whether it be flip-flopping on states’ rights for cannabis laws or praising NATO after promising to leave it, where Trump stands on the issues is a crap shoot. That being said, however, there is one issue on which Trump has remained steadfast, it is bipartisan, and everyone should agree on it — it’s time to stop human trafficking. And a former Democrat congresswoman from Georgia agrees.

It is important to note that human trafficking is not the same as working in the sex industry. Those who work in the sex trade, voluntarily, are not victims of human trafficking. However, they often find themselves victims of the government and the black market created by that government who pushes their line of work into dark alleys and shady places.

As corporate media writes off talk of ‘pizzagate’ as if it’s some tinfoil conspiracy theory that couldn’t possibly happen, recent busts of pedophilia rings are shattering their claims. In fact, after a massive bust in California, Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell says the arrests represent a “very sad commentary on the condition we’re dealing with.”

“Pretending this issue doesn’t exist only makes us more complicit in it,” newly elected San Diego City Attorney Mara Elliott said last month.

However, it appears that Donald Trump has decided that he won’t be party to those who deny the horrid reality that is the child sex trade.

Trump held a press conference last week in which he detailed his plans to go after the victims of the “human trafficking epidemic,” as he explained.

1189,"Sir Alex Ferguson hailed Arsene Wenger as ""an absolute legend"" as the former Arsenal boss enjoyed a special night in his honour.

On Monday night, Wenger was named a 'Legend of Football' at the annual Nordoff Robbins charity award dinner.

Wenger was celebrated after a career in which he won trophies as a manager in England, France and Japan - but most notably during his 21-year tenure as manager of Arsenal.

During that time, Wenger won three Premier League titles, seven FA Cups and seven FA Community Shields.

He also enjoyed a heated rivalry with Ferguson, whose Manchester United side, together with Wenger's Arsenal, dominated English football in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The rivalry often spilled over into bust-ups - famously including 'Pizzagate', when Ferguson took a slice of pizza in the face in the tunnel after his United side had ended Arsenal 49-game unbeaten Premier League run.

Ferguson's comments on his French counterpart over the years have included, ""He's a novice. He should keep his opinions to Japanese football"", while Wenger once insisted he would ""never speak about that man again"".

But speaking on Sunday night, Ferguson was effusive in his praise of Wenger.

Addressing his old adversary via video, Ferguson said: ""The career you had as a manager at Arsenal was absolutely fantastic - an absolute legend.

""I loved the competition against you. We had some great times and it's wonderful you're getting this award tonight. So good luck, my blessing with you.""

Ferguson himself has been a past recipient of the 'Legends of Football' award, which has been handed out since 1996.

Others who have been honoured include Kenny Dalglish, Alan Shearer, Eric Cantona, Jose Mourinho, Ryan Giggs, Pele, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, with the annual dinner having raised £8million for the Nordoff Robins music therapy charity.",mainstream
253,"Prior political beliefs and the tendency for conspiracist ideation appear particularly important for individuals' endorsement of FN, regardless of prior exposure to the specific news presented. As such, conspiracy theory (CT) belief and its underlying mechanisms appear a useful starting point in identifying some of the underlying individual difference variables involved in conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial FN belief. Implications and limitations are discussed.

Political viewpoint was a consistent predictor of FN endorsement. Conspiratorial worldview and schizotypal personality also predicted FN belief, with weaker or less consistent prediction by other variables including dangerous worldview, normlessness, and randomness beliefs. Partial correlation analysis suggested that most variables related to FN through their association with conspiracist ideation and political identity beliefs.

Politically‐slanted fake news (FN)—manufactured disinformation, hoaxes, and satire appearing to present true information about events—is currently receiving extensive attention in the mainstream media. However, it is currently unclear what factors may influence an individual's likelihood to believe in FN, outside of political identity. As FN is often conspiratorial in nature and usually negative, it was theorised that conspiracist belief, and factors that have been found to relate to a conspiratorial worldview (i.e., dangerous worldview and schizotypy), may also relate to political FN.

The phenomenon of “fake news” in the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign received widespread attention in the mainstream media. Some commentators even suggested—in the immediate aftermath of the result—that it had influenced the outcome of the election itself (Parkinson, 2016; Read, 2016). Fake news (FN) refers to manufactured disinformation, hoaxes, and satire appearing to present true information about events, which are spread primarily via social media (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017; Macquarie Dictionary online, n.d.). Relationships between FN and behaviour are yet to be reported scientifically, but there is concern about the influence of FN—particularly politically‐relevant FN—and what can be done to counter it (see Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017; Hunt, 2016; Wendling, 2017). Politically slanted FN content is usually negative, with numerous stories damaging to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton circulating online prior to the 2016 election (see www.snopes.com, for examples). The content of FN often has a conspiratorial aspect: the belief that the explanation for events (or their concealment) is that powerful forces are secretly at work to realise their sinister plans (cf. Swami, Chamorro‐Premuzic, & Furnham, 2010; Zonis & Joseph, 1994). For example, in the week before the election a story dubbed “Pizzagate,” began to circulate, since assessed as being false (La Capria, 2016). It alleged that hacked emails from former Clinton presidential campaign manager, John Podesta, revealed a conspiracy whereby a secret paedophile ring was operating out of a pizza restaurant in the Washington DC that had hosted Clinton‐related events (La Capria, 2016). Given the similarity of much FN to conspiracist ideation, and the larger existing literature on why people believe in conspiracy theories (CTs), in this study we wished to examine whether CT belief, and factors linked in recent studies to CT belief, were a factor underlying FN belief, particularly FN with a conspiratorial bent.

In the literature on the psychology of CTs, a popular notion is the idea of conspiracist ideation or a conspiracist mentality: people who believe in one CT tend to believe in more than one (Moscovici, 1987; Swami et al., 2011). Goertzel (1994) noted that more than 80% of respondents in his study believed that at least two or more CTs from a list of 10 were definitely or probably true. He attributed this tendency to a “monological belief system” (p. 740), wherein belief in one CT becomes a source of evidence for other CTs, enhancing the likelihood of belief in new CTs (see also Imhoff & Bruder, 2013; Moulding et al., 2016; Swami et al., 2010, 2011; Wood, Douglas, & Sutton, 2012). Further, Swami et al. (2011) found, in an Austrian sample (N = 281), that belief in CTs was even predictive of belief in fictional CTs created by the research team. While a range of variables have been found to be implicated in conspiracist belief, perhaps the most consistent findings involve the conceptually related factors comprising a “dangerous worldview” (e.g., Abalakina‐Paap, Stephan, Craig, & Gregory, 1999). These factors include low levels of trust and greater powerlessness, social isolation, and alienation/anomie (Abalakina‐Paap et al., 1999; Goertzel, 1994; Moulding et al., 2016). Moulding et al. (2016) describe the relationship of CT belief with dangerous worldview‐related factors as the “coping‐with‐alienation‐and‐powerlessness” (p. 346) explanation of CT belief. Consistent with this characterisation, and as observed by Abalakina‐Paap et al. (1999), such people reject both official and conventional explanations for what is going on in the world. Instead, CTs provide an alternative explanation of both salient events and ultimately the individual's own circumstances: the world is a bad place, full of bad people plotting for personal gain (Moulding et al., 2016). Belief in conspiratorial FN may work in a similar way, wherein the individual's relative disenfranchisement and disadvantage can be explained in their own mind by the belief that powerful elites are actively cooperating in, or choosing to ignore, malevolent wrong‐doing. Therefore, it is plausible that dangerous worldview‐related factors are associated not only with belief in CTs, but also with belief in conspiratorial FN. Recent research has also noted that schizotypal personality traits are a robust predictor of CT belief—consisting of odd and unusual beliefs, suspicion, magical thinking, perceptual distortions, and paranoia (Barron, Morgan, Towell, Altemeyer, & Swami, 2014; Barron et al., 2018; Bruder, Haffke, Neave, Nouripanah, & Imhoff, 2013; Darwin, Neave, & Holmes, 2011; Swami et al., 2013). For example, Barron et al. (2014) found that schizotypal beliefs, and particularly the odd beliefs and magical thinking subscale, were strong predictors of CT beliefs in a large questionnaire study. Darwin et al. (2011) suggested it was particularly the tendency to suspicion that linked schizotypy and CT belief. More recently, Barron et al. (2018) found using questionnaires that a decrease in analytic thinking partially mediated between the link between schizotypal symptoms and CT belief, among other factors (cf. Moulding et al., 2016). Regardless of the exact mechanism (i.e., reasoning or world‐view), these studies provide evidence to suggest a relationship between schizotypal traits and beliefs in CTs, and by extension to conspiratorial FN. Finally, examining belief in FN in the context of the 2016 U.S. presidential election demands some consideration of the role of political identity. The CT literature suggests that there is generally no significant difference between left‐wing liberals and right‐wing conservatives as to who is more inclined to a conspiracist mentality (Edelson, Alduncin, Krewson, Sieja, & Uscinski, 2017; Goertzel, 1994; Oliver & Wood, 2014). However, belief in specific CTs is differentiated by political or socio‐political persuasion (Oliver & Wood, 2014; Uscinski, Klofstad, & Atkinson, 2016). In short, Republicans are more likely to believe the CT that President Obama was not born in the United States (Oliver & Wood, 2014), while Democrats are more likely to believe that President Bush was complicit in the September 11 attacks (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017). Allcott and Gentzkow (2017) found that Democrats and Republicans are more likely to believe politically congruent FN stories than neutral ones. Building on these findings, it seems likely that Democrats and Republicans are more likely to believe politically congruent—and disbelieve politically incongruent—conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial FN. The aim of this study was to test whether CT beliefs, political identity, and factors previously shown to be involved in CT belief are also involved in belief in conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial FN, using a questionnaire design in a sample of U.S. participants. It was predicted that conspiracist ideation would be positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN, and that political identity would be positively related to belief in FN about the opposite party's candidate and negatively correlated with belief in conspiratorial FN about one's own candidate. It was hypothesised that schizotypy, dangerous worldview, randomness, and alienation would be positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN, and that perceived benevolence of the world would be negatively related to belief in conspiratorial FN. While there are reasonable theoretical grounds to believe these hypotheses are true for conspiratorial FN, hypotheses will also be tested for relationships with non‐conspiratorial FN. Finally, to control for whether it is just a factor of exposure to the specific FN via the media, we also examined whether entirely fictitious conspiratorial FN invented for this study had similar correlates.

There was no missing data. Scales had acceptable reliability, except for the belief in non‐conspiratorial FN about Trump subscale, which was marginal (α = 0.65; see Table 1). Consistent with the overall voting history, the sample was somewhat left‐leaning, but there was suitable range for analysis. Correlational analyses suggested that the three political variables correlated with the news types for all candidates, with the PIS significantly correlating with all types of news, whereas the LRS and LAS correlated with four of the six types, with correlations in the expected directions. Conspiratorial ideation related positively to all types of FN excepting non‐conspiratorial FN regarding Trump, while the OLIFE related to all types excepting FN for Trump and entirely‐fictitious FN for Clinton, the latter of which just missed significance. Of the worldview variables, the DWS and DAS‐Norm related positively to four of the six news types, while the WAS‐Randomness related negatively to FN and entirely factiously fake news (EFN) regarding Trump, and positively to conspiratorial FN regarding Clinton. The other variables did not relate to FN endorsement. As we were interested in whether the variables related above‐and‐beyond conspiratorial ideation, and above‐and‐beyond political identity, partial correlations were performed controlling separately for these variables (Table 2). Only variables that were initially significant for at least some types of FN were considered for analysis. Generally, when controlling for political identity, the Left–Right Scale and Libertarian–Authoritarian Scale was reduced in their strength of correlation, though the LAS remained significant for some variables consistent with it measuring a wider construct than the political identity scale. Interestingly, the WAS‐Randomness only remained significant for one variable (FN‐Trump), and the Dangerous Wordview Scale was also reduced in many of its correlations, while DAS‐Normlessness, the BCTI and OLIFE were largely unaffected, when controlling for political identity. In contrast, controlling for conspiratorial worldview did not affect the general pattern of correlations of FN with political variables or WAS‐Randomness, but did largely reduce correlations with the OLIFE and DAS‐Normlessness, and the DWS. Correlations for prediction of various FN types

The aim of this study was to test whether factors previously shown to be involved in CT belief are also involved in belief in conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial political FN. It was hypothesised that conspiracist ideation would be positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN. This hypothesis was supported. It was hypothesised that schizotypy, dangerous worldview, randomness, and alienation would be positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN and benevolence would be negatively related to belief in conspiratorial FN. There was partial support for this hypothesis. The final hypothesis was that political identity and political views would be positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN about the opposite party's candidate and negatively correlated with belief in conspiratorial FN about one's own candidate. Again, this hypothesis was supported. As was anticipated, based on research by Allcott and Gentzkow (2017), political identity was related to belief in conspiratorial FN that is congruent with one's political viewpoint. Similarly, more general left–right and libertarian–authoritarian views were related to belief in FN, excepting the two conspiratorial categories regarding Trump. That these predictive relationships exist is unsurprising, but it is important that this is now established empirically. That political identity predicted belief in FN could be attributable to a phenomenon known as motivated reasoning, or motivated partisan reasoning. In motivated reasoning, people have been found to process information in a way that protects or enhances their current belief system (even in the face of contradictory information; Miller, Saunders, & Farhart, 2015). Motivated partisan reasoning happens when people judge information about their ingroup more positively and information about the outgroup more negatively (Claassen & Ensley, 2016; Edelson et al., 2017). There is a significant body of evidence to suggest that motivated reasoning elicits differences in how people process information on topics ranging from American football to political campaigning “dirty tricks” (Carey, Nyhan, Valentino, & Liu, 2016; Claassen & Ensley, 2016). Indeed, Edelson et al. (2017) found that conspiratorial thinking and motivated partisan reasoning were both predictors of belief in electoral fraud in the United States. Research directly investigating whether political identity influences FN through such mechanisms may be an important branch of future work. Turning to conspiracist ideation, general conspiratorial thinking related to belief in conspiratorial FN (both for in‐circulation FN and fictious FN invented for this study), and indeed also predicted non‐conspiracist FN regarding Clinton. This would suggest that Goertzel's “monological belief system” may also be at work in belief in FN regardless of whether such news stories are novel or in‐circulation (cf. Moulding et al., 2016; Swami et al., 2011). Based on suggestions that conspiratorial worldview may be related to FN belief, we also examined factors that have been found to predict CT more generally in whether they linked to FN. Consistent with its relationship to the conspiratorial worldview (e.g., Darwin et al., 2011), we found that schizotypy also positively predicted all types of political FN barring non‐conspiratorial FN for Trump. These findings were largely—albeit not completely—removed when controlling for conspiratorial worldview, but not when controlling political views. Similar but less strong or less consistent relationships were found with dangerous worldview, which were again removed when controlling for conspiracism, and to a lesser extent by political identity. Randomness was positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN about Clinton, and negatively with belief in FN about Trump and fictitious FN regarding Trump. The relationship between randomness and the FN variables was largely ameliorated when controlling for political identity but not conspiracism. This suggests that the relationship between randomness and FN was due to associations with political identity rather than conspiracism; indeed, in contrast to the findings of Moulding et al. (2016), randomness was not related to conspiracist ideation generally. The opposing findings indicate that people who see hidden order in society are more likely to endorse Clinton conspiratorial FN, whereas those who believe that societal events are more chaotic are more likely to endorse Trump FN. While benevolence and alienation were related to conspiracist ideation generally, only normlessness predicted FN, with small relationships with the FN variables excepting non‐conspiratorial Trump FN, while the relationships with conspiratorial FN regarding Clinton just missed significance. These relationships were largely removed when controlling for conspiracism but not political identity. Overall, then, we found that political identity and conspiracism were strong and important predictors of political FN, with only the relationship between non‐conspiratorial FN regarding Trump and conspiracist thinking missing significance. It was a little surprising that the non‐conspiratorial FN regarding Clinton was predicted by conspiracism; however, examination of the items indicated that the non‐conspiratorial Clinton items also implied a level of public–private duplicity that could perhaps be consistent with a conspiratorial viewpoint even if they are not strictly conspiratorial by definition. Overall, it appears that some of the worldview variables are important factors, but that these may operate through their association with political identity (in the case of left–right views, randomness, and to some extent dangerous worldview), or with conspiracism (particularly for schizotypy, normlessness, and to a greater extent, dangerous worldview). Generally, significant relationships between the independent variables and conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial FN about Clinton seemed of a stronger effect size than the independent variable relationships with belief in conspiratorial FN about Trump. Indeed, there is a small body of evidence to suggest that at the present time, Republicans may indeed be more likely to believe or have stronger belief in FN than Democrats. Allcott and Gentzkow (2017) found that FN favouring Trump both out‐numbered and was out‐shared on Facebook compared to FN favouring Clinton, by factors of three‐to‐one and four‐to‐one respectively (although they note that sharing a story is not the same as believing it; indeed, it may not be the same as even reading it). They speculate that one possible explanation for this is that Republicans are more inclined to believe FN. Interestingly, they cite evidence (McClosky & Chong, 1985; Uscinski et al., 2016) of non‐partisanship in a predisposition to conspiratorial thinking as evidence against this hypothesis. Pennycook and Rand (2017) found Clinton supporters were better able to discern fake from real news than were Trump supporters in their recent study (N = 800), where participants were asked to judge the accuracy of news headlines presented in “Facebook” format. In summary, there are potential between‐group differences based on political identity regarding belief in FN that merit further investigation. However, we wish to strongly note that as we did not have any a priori hypotheses regarding these specific differences, such findings should be viewed as post hoc, and should be taken with great caution unless replicated. There were limitations in this study. Participants were predominantly young and more left‐wing than the average voter, and so generalisation may be questioned. Reported voting (87%) was higher than the national average (estimated by McDonald, 2016 at around 60%), suggesting participants were more politically engaged than would be typical. The study is correlational in nature and thus causation cannot be inferred. The subscale measuring belief in non‐conspiratorial FN about Trump had only marginal reliability, which may have lowered power. We also did not ask participants if they had been exposed to the specific FN stories, which may have played a role in the findings; while the findings with entirely fabricated FN argue against a mere exposure effect, these were lower than for the other categories of FN generally. It may be useful to gauge this in future studies, although care should be taken that the exposure measure does not simply become a proxy measure of believability (i.e., people could tend to believe they have seen stories they endorse before, regardless of actual exposure). Finally, while politically slanted FN appears to be generating the most concern in current society, it would be of interest to see if these results also generalise to more general FN (particularly those linked to CT beliefs). In conclusion, the community is justifiably concerned about the rise of FN and particularly political FN, since—at the very least—people who consume and believe FN are at heightened risk of holding inaccurate beliefs about the world (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017). This preliminary investigation expands our understanding of political FN by demonstrating that CT belief is a useful starting point in identifying some of the underlying individual difference variables involved in conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial FN belief. Future experimental and mechanism‐based studies can further this research into this important aspect of modern society.",mainstream

915,"Operation INFEKTION was the popular name given to a disinformation campaign run by the KGB in the 1980s to plant the idea that the United States had invented HIV/AIDS[2][3] as part of a biological weapons research project at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Historian Thomas Boghardt popularized the codename ""INFEKTION"" based on the claims of former East German Ministry of State Security (Stasi) officer Günther Bohnsack, who claimed that the Stasi codename for the campaign was either ""INFEKTION"" or perhaps also ""VORWÄRTS II"" (""FORWARD II"").[2] However, historians Christopher Nehring and Douglas Selvage found in the former Stasi and Bulgarian State Security archives materials that prove the actual Stasi codename for the AIDS disinformation campaign was Operation ""DENVER"".[4][5]

According to the U.S. State Department, the Soviet Union used the campaign to undermine the United States' credibility, foster anti-Americanism, isolate America abroad, and create tensions between host countries and the U.S. over the presence of American military bases (which were often portrayed as the cause of AIDS outbreaks in local populations).[6] U.S. State Department analysts also claim that another reason the Soviet Union ""promoted the AIDS disinformation may have been its attempt to distract international attention away from its own offensive biological warfare program, which [was monitored] for decades."" The report posits that the operation may have been partly in retaliation for American accusations that the Soviets used chemical weapons in Southeast Asia, later dubbed the yellow rain incident. [2]

The groundwork appeared in the pro-Soviet Indian newspaper Patriot which, according to a KGB defector named Ilya Dzerkvelov, was set up by the KGB in 1962 for the sheer purpose of publishing disinformation.[6] An anonymous letter was sent to the editor in July 1983 from a ""well-known American scientist and anthropologist"" who claimed that AIDS was manufactured at Fort Detrick by genetic engineers. The ""scientist"" claimed that ""that deadly mysterious disease was believed to be the results of the Pentagon's experiments to develop new and dangerous biological weapons,"" and implicated CDC scientists sent to Africa and Latin America to find dangerous viruses alien to Asia and Europe. These results were purportedly analyzed in Atlanta and Fort Detrick and thus the ""most likely course of events"" leading to the development of AIDS. The letter claimed that the Pentagon was continuing such experiments in neighboring Pakistan and as a result, the AIDS virus was threatening to spread to India. The title of the article, ""AIDS May Invade India,"" suggested that the immediate goal of the KGB's disinformation was to exacerbate relations between the U.S., India, and Pakistan.[6][7]

Two years later, the KGB apparently decided to make use of its earlier disinformation to launch an international campaign to discredit the U.S. They wrote in a telegram to their allied secret service in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Committee for State Security (Комитет за държавна сигурност, Komitet za dǎržavna sigurnost, KDS) on September 7, 1985:

The telegram, which referred indirectly back to the Patriot article (""facts ... in the press of the developing countries, in particular India""), provided guidance to Bulgarian State Security regarding how to couch their AIDS disinformation:

A month later, the Soviet newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta, also a known outlet for KGB disinformation,[9] published an article from Valentin Zapevalov entitled, “Panic in the West, or What Is Hiding Behind the Sensation Surrounding AIDS.” It cited the (dis)information contained in the Patriot article,[10] but also gave further details regarding the alleged development of the AIDS virus. Employees of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control had allegedly assisted the Pentagon by traveling to Zaire, Nigeria and Latin America to collect samples of the ""most pathogenic viruses"" that could not be found in Europe or Asia. These samples were then combined to develop the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. The Pentagon then carried out isolated experiments in Haiti and within the U.S. itself on marginalized groups in U.S. society: drug addicts, homosexuals, and the homeless.[11] Zapevalov's article was subsequently reprinted in Kuwait, Bahrain, Finland, Sweden, Peru, and other countries.[12] It followed very closely the guidelines that the KGB had already sent to its Bulgarian ""comrades"" a month before.[8]

Stasi Involvement in the Disinformation Campaign

Determining the exact role of the Stasi in the AIDS disinformation campaign has been difficult, given that around 90% of the records of its foreign intelligence division, the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance (Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung, HVA) were destroyed[13] or disappeared[14] in 1989–90. Based on materials in the Bulgarian secret police archives, the card files of the HVA, and documents from or relating to the HVA scattered among the records of other divisions of the Stasi, it has been possible to reconstruct some aspects of the Stasi's involvement in the disinformation campaign. At the beginning of September 1986, the tenth division of the HVA (HVA/X), responsible for organizing and coordinating the HVA's campaigns of active measures, wrote the following in a draft plan for cooperation with Bulgarian State Security:

The KGB confirmed that the East German HVA was playing a central role on various occasions, including in a telegram to the Bulgarians in 1987:

As noted above, the Stasi's HVA/X had written that it would send its Bulgarian “comrades” a “scientific study” allegedly “proving” that “AIDS is a product of the USA’s bioweapons research.""[4][15] From the context of the discussions between officers of the HVA/X and their Bulgarian counterparts in mid-September 1986, it was clear which study was meant: “AIDS: Its Nature and Origin” by Soviet-East German biologist Jakob Segal and his wife, Dr. Lilli Segal. The study had been distributed at the summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in August–September 1986 in a brochure entitled, “AIDS: USA home-made evil, NOT out of AFRICA.”[4] The report was quoted heavily by Soviet propagandists, and the Segals were often said to be French researchers to hide their connections to communism. Although both Segals, given the double danger to them as Jews and members of the German Communist Party, had fled into exile in France in 1933, both had attained Soviet citizenship in 1940 on the basis of Jakob's birth in (then Soviet-annexed) Lithuania, and in 1953, they had returned to Germany—specifically, to communist East Berlin.[17]

In his report, Jakob Segal postulated that the AIDS virus was synthesized by combining parts of two distantly related retroviruses: VISNA and HTLV-1.[6] An excerpt of the Segal report reads as follows:

Elsewhere in the report, Segal said that his hypothesis was based purely on assumptions, extrapolations, and hearsay and not at all on direct scientific evidence.[6]

The exact relationship of both Segals to the KGB, Stasi, or both at this time—to the extent that it existed—remains unclear. Both publicly denied any involvement of the KGB or Stasi in their work. The Deputy Director of HVA/X, Wolfgang Mutz, hinted that the HVA had played a role in the publication – or actually, the photocopying – and distribution of the Harare brochure in talks with Bulgarian State Security in September 1986.[4][18] He also suggested that the ""operational division"" of the HVA with which HVA/X had been cooperating in the disinformation campaign had somehow ""attracted"" Segal to his research.[19]

This ""operational division"" was in fact an office in the Sector for Science and Technology (Sektor Wissenschaft und Technik, SWT) of the HVA, responsible for intelligence-gathering on AIDS and genetic engineering (HVA/SWT/XIII/5). This office had registered a “security dossier” (Sicherungsvorgang, SVG) “Wind” on September 6, 1985, regarding the protection of East German scientists in the areas of AIDS research, genetic engineering and biotechnology from outside “attacks” in the form of espionage or manipulation by foreign agents. This office in HVA/SWT apparently registered both Segals in this dossier as ""contact persons"" under the codename ""Diagnosis""; whenever other divisions of the Stasi inquired about the Segals, they were directed to this office. HVA/SWT—or ""the security,"" as Jakob Segal called them—gave him at least one piece of advice regarding his study before its printing and distribution. Whether Segal listened to this advice remains unclear. Still, given their official designation as “contact persons,” they need not have known, at least officially, that they were dealing with the Stasi, although Jakob Segal likely knew or could have guessed, given his past dealings with both the Stasi and the KGB. It is quite possible that HVA/SWT was already coordinating with the KGB regarding Segal's research – even without his knowledge – in the second half of 1985, at the time that “Wind” was registered.[20] Nevertheless, none of the Stasi officers involved with ""Wind"" or Operation ""DENVER"" ever claimed that the HVA had played a role in drafting Segal's study. It was clearly his own work, in cooperation with his wife Lilli, although he knew and expected that it would be used for ""propaganda.""[21]

Whatever exact relationship the Segals may or may not have had to the Soviet or East German security services, the KGB praised Segal's work in its 1987 telegram to Bulgarian State Security. His articles and brochures, the KGB wrote, had attained ""great renown."" This was especially the case in African countries, where governments and researchers were rejecting as racist assertions by U.S. researchers that AIDS had originated naturally in Africa, where it had spread from monkeys to humans.[16] The KGB wrote the Bulgarians:

The AIDS story exploded across the world, and was repeated by Soviet newspapers, magazines, wire services, radio broadcasts, and television. It appeared 40 times in Soviet media in 1987 alone. It received coverage in over 80 countries in more than 30 languages,[6] primarily in leftist and communist media publications, and was found in countries as widespread as Bolivia, Grenada, Pakistan, New Zealand, Nigeria, and Malta. A few versions made their way into non-communist press in Indonesia and the Philippines.[6]

Dissemination was usually along a recognized pattern: propaganda and disinformation would first appear in a country outside of the USSR and only then be picked up by a Soviet news agency, which attributed it to others' investigative journalism. That the story came from a foreign source (not widely known to be Soviet controlled or influenced) added credibility to the allegations, especially in impoverished and less educated countries which generally could not afford access to Western news satellite feeds. To aid in media placement, Soviet propaganda was provided free of charge, and many stories came with cash benefits.[6] This was particularly the case in India and Ghana, where the Soviet Union maintained a large propaganda and disinformation apparatus for covert media placement.[6]

To explain how AIDS outbreaks in Africa occurred simultaneously, the Moscow World Service announced a discovery by Soviet correspondent Aleksandr Zhukov, who claimed that in the early 1970s, a Pentagon-controlled West German lab in Zaire ""succeeded in modifying the non-lethal Green Monkey virus into the deadly AIDS virus."" Radio Moscow also claimed that instead of testing a cholera vaccine, American scientists were actually infecting unwitting Zairians, thus spreading AIDS throughout the continent. These scientists were unaware of the long period before symptom onset, and resumed experimentation on convicts upon return to the U.S., where it then spread when the prisoners escaped.[6]

Claims that the CIA had sent ""AIDS-oiled condoms"" to other countries sprang up independently in the African press, well after the disinformation operation started.[2] In 1987, a book (Once Again About the CIA) was published by the Novosti Press Agency, with the quote:

The resulting public backlash eventually closed down the legitimate medical research centre. Soviet allegations declared the purpose of these research projects, to include that of AIDS, was to ""enlarge the war arsenal.""[6]

Ironically, many Soviet scientists were soliciting help from American researchers to help address the Soviet Union's burgeoning AIDS problem, while stressing the virus' natural origins. The U.S. refused to help as long as the disinformation campaign continued.[6] The Segal Report and the plenitude of press articles were dismissed by both Western and Soviet virologists as nonsense.[6]

Dr. Meinrad Koch, a West Berlin AIDS expert, stated in 1987 that the Segal report was ""utter nonsense"" and called it an ""evil pseudo-scientific political concoction."" Other scientists also pointed out flaws and inaccuracies in the Segal Report, including Dr. Viktor Zhdanov of the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in Moscow, who was the top Soviet AIDS expert at the time. The president of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences clearly stated that he believed the virus to be of natural origin. Other scientists and doctors from Paris, East and West Berlin, India, and Belgium called the AIDS rumors lies, scientifically unfounded, and otherwise impossible to seriously consider.[6] Although Segal himself never said ""this is fact"" and was very careful to maintain this line throughout his report, ""such technical qualifiers do not diminish the impact of the charges, however, because when they are replayed, such qualifiers are typically either omitted or overlooked by readers or listeners.""[6]

U.S. Embassy officials wrote dozens of letters to various newspaper editors and journalists, and held meetings and press conferences to clarify matters. Many of their efforts resulted in newspapers printing retractions and apologies.[6] Rebuttals appeared in reports to Congress and from the State Department saying that it was impossible at the time to build a virus as complex as AIDS; medical research had only gotten so far as to clone simple viruses. Antibodies were found decades earlier than the reported research started, and the main academic source used for the story (Segal's Report) contained inaccuracies about even such basic things as American geography—Segal said that outbreaks appeared in New York City because it was the closest big city to Fort Detrick. Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. are all closer, while New York is 200 miles (320 km) away.[6]

The Gorbachev administration also responded indignantly and launched a defensive denial campaign ""aimed at limiting the damage done to its credibility by U.S. efforts to raise world consciousness concerning the scope of Soviet disinformation activities.""[6] The Soviet Union interfered with general attempts by U.S. Embassy officials to address misconceptions and expose the Soviet disinformation campaign, to include placing pressure on news agencies that recanted their position. For example, Literaturnaya Gazeta on December 3, 1986, castigated a Brazilian newspaper which earlier in the year had run a retraction following its publication of the AIDS disinformation story. In 1987, Moscow's Novosti news agency disseminated a report datelined Brazzaville (Congo), calling on the West to put an end to the ""anti-African campaign,"" and repeating the charges that the virus was created in US military laboratories"" while in 1986 Literaturnaya Gazeta warned specifically against contact with Americans.[6]

In 1988, Sovetskaya Rossiya put out an article defending their right to report different views. The chief of Novosti stated that it drew upon foreign sources for much of the AIDS coverage, and that the press was free under glasnost.[6]

The campaign faded from most Soviet media outlets, but it occasionally resurfaced abroad in third-world countries as late as 1988, usually via press placement agents.[6]

In 1992, 15% of Americans considered it definitely or probably true that ""the AIDS virus was created deliberately in a government laboratory.""[2] In 2005, a study by the RAND Corporation and Oregon State University revealed that nearly 50% of African Americans thought AIDS was man-made, over 25% believed AIDS was a product of a government laboratory, 12% believed it was created and spread by the CIA, and 15% believed that AIDS was a form of genocide against black people.[2] Other AIDS conspiracy theories have abounded, and have been discredited by the mainstream scientific community.

In 1992, KGB Director Yevgeny Primakov admitted that the KGB was behind the newspaper articles claiming that AIDS was created by the U.S. government.[1] Segal's role was exposed by KGB defector Vasili Mitrokhin in the Mitrokhin Archive. The 1999 book Stasi: The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police describes how the Stasi cooperated with the KGB to spread the story.[24]

1273,"For a large part of 2016, there's been a ton of discussion about fake news: How it spreads online, why it spreads in the first place, and who is involved in reading, believing, and spreading false stories.

It's a complicated issue with many angles. Fake news spreads because sometimes, people believe what they want to believe. It spreads because some people want to make money from it. It spreads because of political agendas.

It spreads because truth, and what's now called ""post-truth"" have an enormous arena in which to compete:

And the very mechanics of the complex systems of the internet are a big part of how and why fake news spreads.

Jonathan Albright is a professor at Elon University in North Carolina.

He researches social news, and, more recently, online propaganda. To study the way these so-called ""fake news"" stories spread, Jonathan looked at hundreds of stories that were tagged by academics as ""inaccurate"" or ""propaganda."" He came up with the term ""micropropoganda"" to describe what most people have called ""fake news.""

A lot of the finger-pointing has been at Facebook. The argument is that the Facebook algorithm favours and promotes stories that have lots of likes, shares, and so on. So you have a false story like the so-called Pizzagate story (about an underground pedophile ring in the basement of a pizzeria in Washington). If there's enough engagement with it, it shows up more. If it shows up more, more people see it and share it. And the ""truth"" of the story matters less and less.

But according to Jonathan, it isn't just Facebook that's the problem. It isn't even social media.

He found that a lot of inaccurate stories and sites promoting fake news were being shared the old fashioned way. ""Search engine referrals were just strangely high. And also direct referrals, which tells me maybe things are being transmitted by text messaging and even email and email newsletters. You know you can see these types of patterns,"" he explains. So he made a visualization of what he found, which you can see above.

There are all these multi-coloured circles of different sizes, connected by a web of lines. Each circle represents a website. And the lines show a network of fake news, anti-science, hoax, and misinformation.

When you look at the image, what you notice is that the bigger circles in the middle are mostly mainstream media sites. Things like The New York Times, CNN, The National Review, Slate, and Fox News.

But surrounding those are smaller ""fringe"" sites, or what Jonathan calls satellites. Jonathan thinks that the spread of fake news happens because of the way these fringe sites link to mainstream media.

So fringe sites ""surround"" traditional news media like satellites, by linking over and over again to their content.

""You can see that these smaller right-wing sites have basically populated the entire network of news...the left wing media and centre are distant from social media... if you look at this map, these smaller sites have basically populated the area around Google, around Youtube, around Twitter. So it shows an interesting strategy, almost like a virtual battleground,"" he says.

It's a pretty effective use of the web. Simply...linking. A LOT.

But in the run-up to the recent American election, it was even more effective because media like the New York Times, Washington Post and MSNBC essentially ignored these fringe sites. In doing so, they isolated themselves.

It goes beyond the simple sharing of links, Jonathan believes, because, when you think about it, that's always been the way news outlets establish their credibility online. But it gets a bit more ominous, he adds, when bots, or programs designed to mimic people, also join the fray, sharing links on social media - or even engaging in online conversation.

But even without the threat of bots, humans do a pretty good job of mucking things up.

So can this trend be reversed, or is the web being fundamentally destabilized, at least in the way people consume and use media?

""Maybe there needs to be a new definition of the web,"" he says. And, he adds, in a political sense, the left needs to engage the right in the same way.

1303,"Spacey’s career long blended highbrow acclaim and mainstream appeal. A stage thespian before he was a film lead, he amassed glittering awards and a prestigious post as the artistic director of the Old Vic theater in London. These are not merely the spoils of a movie star; they are the signifiers of one who approaches his trade as capital-a Art. This particular artist’s muse? Evil. Spacey’s signature turns in The Usual Suspects, Seven, and House of Cards were all charismatic bad guys, and for 1999’s American Beauty, his suburban-dad character, Lester, lusted after a teenage girl. Accepting the Oscar for Best Actor, Spacey said he loved playing Lester “because we got to see all of his worst qualities and we still grew to love him. This movie to me is all about how any single act from any single person put out of context is damnable.”

The “Let Me Be Frank” video may be an attempt to reassert this professional history. Spacey the great actor is implied in his complaint that his scandals led to an “unsatisfying ending” that could have been “memorable”—a likely dig at the poorly reviewed final season of Cards that didn’t feature Frank Underwood. Spacey the philosopher of misdeeds is here, too: “I told you my deepest, darkest secrets,” he says, seeming to speak both as Frank and also as himself, the public figure. “I showed you exactly what people are capable of. I shocked you with my honesty, but mostly I challenged you and made you think. And you trusted me, even though you knew you shouldn’t.”

Read: The Kevin Spacey allegations, through the lens of power

Left unstated is the way that Spacey’s acting career was accompanied by allegations of misbehavior, sexual and otherwise. (He’s apologized to his first public accuser, Anthony Rapp, and denied or remained silent on other allegations.) The Usual Suspects shut down production for two days after Spacey made an advance on a younger actor on set, the actor Gabriel Byrne told The Sunday Times. Producers on House of Cards conducted an investigation and sent Spacey to retraining in 2012 after an inappropriate “remark and gesture.”

Also left unreckoned with in Spacey’s video is the difference between the thrill of fictional villainy and the effects of the real-life kind. One of Spacey’s accusers, the filmmaker Tony Montana, has talked about the PTSD and shame he suffered after Spacey allegedly grabbed him. Another, who says he was 15 when a 24-year-old Spacey tried to rape him, told Vulture, “What he left me with, more than what he took from me, was a sense that I deserved this. And that’s the knot I’m still untangling.”

All of this queasy context is surely part of why Spacey’s video accrued more than 7 million views in just a few days. People are rubbernecking at the disgraced star opting to play the villain. “Kevin Spacey is sending a very disturbing message as he chastises his audience,” the actress Ellen Barkin tweeted. “If you hypocrites loved me as a murderer, why won’t you love me as a sex offender? Maybe because Frank Underwood’s crimes are fiction and Kevin Spacey’s are not.” Wrote Patricia Arquette, “I’m sure none of the men who were kids at the time of their sexual assaults appreciate @KevinSpacey’s weird video.”",mainstream
488,"The influential publication The Economist released its traditional end of year edition where it predicts events of the coming year. The 2017 edition is presented in a very occult fashion: A tarot deck modified with cryptic symbols.

If you thought that 2016 was not a great year, well The Economist does not seem too optimistic about the year to come. Indeed, in its “The Year in 2017” cover, the publication predicts death and turmoil in a dark occult context, using tarot cards and cryptic symbolism.

When The Economist released The World in 2015 cover, I simply had to write an extensive article about it because it alluded, through symbolism, to various agendas of the elite. Indeed, The Economist is not your typical magazine, it is a ‘prestigious’ publication owned by powerful people. As I’ve written in the 2015 article:

While some images on that 2015 cover referred to obvious events, others were extremely cryptic – even ‘coded’ – as they were never satisfactorily explained.

This year’s edition is even more enigmatic. It uses the tarot to predict the year to come. Here it is.

The first thing one can say about this cover is that it is occult. The tarot is indeed said to contain within its symbolism the entirety of occult mysteries transmitted by secret societies. Also, considering that the cards of the Major Arcana are also referred to as “trumps”, it was a great way to emphasize that next year will be very influenced by Trump’s election.

Using tarot cards to predict the future, in a publication that is owned by the occult elite, is quite fitting. Through the centuries, several versions of the tarot were created. However, most of them contain the same symbolism which alludes to specific esoteric concepts. Occultists agree that the tarot originates from Ancient Egypt.

The tarot is an extremely dense compilation of occult concepts and symbolism, encompassing Freemasonry, numerology, the kabbalah, and alchemy.

The Economist’s cover was inspired by the Rider-Waite deck which was published in 1909. Here it is.

The Rider-Waite deck was conceived by the prominent occultist A.E. Waite who was an initiate and a master of several secret societies.

Therefore, by using the Rider-Waite deck to predict 2017, The Economist reveals the true force that makes these predictions happen: The occult elite.

Let’s look at the cryptic symbolism found on each card.

The first card of ‘planet Trump’ is The Tower. By doing so, the cover begins predictions on a rather grim note. Not unlike The Tower of the Rider-Waite deck, the card features a tower being destroyed by lightning from above, a reference to the Tower of Babel being destroyed by God. This card is usually associated with danger, crisis, destruction, and liberation.

On The Economist’s cover, the tower is surrounded by mobs of people holding a red communist flag and a crucifix. Why are communists and Christians facing each other while the tower is being destroyed? Is The Economist alluding to the two forces that are said to have propelled Trump to power – Russia and conservative Christianity?

Or does it maybe refer to the growing divide between two opposite groups – globalists/liberals/socialists versus nationalist/religious/conservatives?

On the tower’s door is nailed a piece of paper. This appears to be a reference to Martin Luther’s Ninety-five Theses.

A painting of Martin Luther nailing his Theses on the door of All Saints’ Church in Wittenberg.

Martin Luther’s thesis criticized various aspects of Catholicism, a gesture that prompted Protestant Reformation. Is The Economist predicting a difficult year for the Catholic Church?

Donald Trump is sitting on the globe while holding an orb and a scepter – objects referring to a monarchy. In other words, Trump is the king of the world. Monarchy and democracy are political systems that are extremely different. The Economist appears to be predicting that Trump will rule the world like a monarch.

Furthermore, why is this image associated the Judgement card? The Economist’s card looks nothing like the Judgement card from the Rider-Waite deck which depicts the Angel Gabriel on Judgement Day as described by the Book of Revelation.

The Book of Revelation mentions several times the term ‘kings of the Earth’. They are sometimes said to worship Christ and in other passages, they are said to worship the Beast.

When portrayed in a negative context, these ‘kings of the earth’ suffer the judgment symbolized in the seven seals, trumpets, and bowls, finally concluding with their defeat by the rider of the white horse in chapter 19. Strange fact: There’s a white horse on the cover.

Once again, The Economist’s The World card looks nothing like its Rider-Waite counterpart. In tarot, The World card represents an ending to a cycle of life, a pause in life before the next big cycle beginning with the fool. It is also associated with the concept of ‘unification’.

On The Economist’s version, we see images representing arts, literature, and theater floating above three monuments. Two of them feature classical architecture found in Rome, Greece, Washington DC and Paris (the monument in the middle resembles the Panthéon). The Egyptian pyramid brings to the card a mystical, esoteric dimension.

These three monuments perfectly represent the historical influence of the ‘occult elite’ on society. Claiming to be the guardians of the Mysteries originating from Ancient Egypt, passed down through secret societies such the Knights Templar, the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians and the Bavarian Illuminati, the elite has been the secret force behind profound cultural and political changes.

On The Economist’s card, lines connect these the three buildings of power with symbols representing popular culture. In other words, the occult elite produces a single and cohesive popular culture that is found throughout the world.

While The Hermit card in the Rider-Waite deck is rather simple, The Economist’s version is dense and full of turmoil. It depicts hordes of people marching while holding flags rejecting the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership), the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) and the EU (European Union). Other flags simply say ‘STOP’ and ‘NO’ which reflect general of globalization and the agenda surrounding it. Hermits live in seclusion of society and these people want to live in seclusion from the world order.

At the bottom right of the card is a cracked globe, another ominous symbol referring to profound division and destruction.

Silently overseeing the scene is the same hermit found on the Rider-Waite deck who holds a staff and a lantern. What does he represent? Here is the esoteric meaning of The Hermit.

The Hermit, therefore, represents the occult elite, the ‘secret organizations’ that have ruled the world for centuries and concealed occult knowledge from the profane (i.e. the masses). Is the hermit silently watching the masses getting excited about nationalism because it falls ultimately falls into a greater scheme? No matter what the case may be, the next card is not very optimistic.

This card cannot be more ominous. Not unlike the Rider-Waite version, the card features a skeleton sitting on a white horse. On The Economist’s version, a nuclear mushroom is in the background which probably alludes to tensions to come between nuclear powers around the world (a mushroom was also on the 2015 cover). Other calamities are found on the card such as mosquitoes (a reference to zika-type viruses?) and a dead fish in a dried up river (the growing water crisis around the world?).

Strange detail: The card features the same ‘blazing sun’ in the background found on The World card (with inverted colors).

This card is very similar to its Rider-Waite counterpart. In both cases, the magician has one hand towards the heavens and another towards the earth – a reference to the hermetic axiom “as above, so below”. In The Economist’s version, the magician is wearing a VR (virtual reality) helmet while working a 3D printer.

As Arthur C. Clark’s third law stipulates:

On this card, 3D printing appears to be a ‘magical’ solution to create low-cost housing solutions – an industry that is already ramping up. VR will undoubtedly be a big thing in 2017 as several products are set to be released in the coming years.

The infinity symbol found above the magician can refer to the limitless possibilities of both technologies: One can create infinite virtual worlds while the other can greatly expand the limits of material resources.

This card refers to the upcoming elections in three European nations: France, Germany and the Netherlands. Marine LePen, Angela Merkel, and Geert Wilders are attached to a spinning wheel next to election ballots.

In the Rider-Waite deck, the Wheel of Fortune card features an eight-spoked wheel – the Cycle of Necessity – an esoteric symbol referring to the cyclic nature of life.

The world of politics is also cyclic and, according to The Economist, a smiling Marine Le Pen is heading towards the top of the wheel while a pouting Merkel is upside down and heading down. To make things worse, Merkel is next to dark cloud while Le Pen is under a nice clear sky. Is Merkel heading towards a bitter defeat? Will her controversial “open door policy”, which allowed the entrance of over a million refugees in Germany in the past years, cause her to lose?

Conversely, will Le Pen profit from the nationalist momentum started by Brexit and the election of Trump? Will France become another powerful country ruled by the ‘far-right’ and nationalism? While Le Pen’s political party Le Front National used to be shunned and described as racist, it might gain political legitimacy in 2017.

Geert Wilders, who is another “far-right” candidate who is described by media as being “populist” and “racist”. Things are looking up for him as well.

While those who reject globalism might perceive this change in political scenery as a victory, the symbolism of this card appears to say: “It is all part of the plan”. Indeed, political parties, whether they be ‘far-right’ or ‘far-left’ are all part of the same ever-turning wheel, the “cycle of necessity” that puts into power whoever is necessary at that specific time. In other words, the momentum of nationalism might be planned by the elite to accomplish specific goals.

In tarot, The Star card represents joy, optimism, and feeling connected with the divine. In The Economist’s version, the faces of 15 young people appear inside yellow stars. I could not identify any of these faces. Some of them appear to be in their early teens.

Who are these specific young people? Will they be rising stars in 2017? Why is there a shooting star in the center? Strange card.

The tarot is known by all yet it conceals, in plain sight, a knowledge that has been hidden from the ‘profane’ for centuries. The Economist’s tarot cover accomplishes the same goal: It is published across the world yet its true meaning will only be fully understood by few.

The cover was heavily inspired by the tarot deck created by A.E Waite, a prominent occultist and founder of secret societies. By referring to this specific deck and by using its very hermetic symbolism, The Economist is pointing towards the true philosophy of those ruling the world.

Like the tarot, The World in 2017 predicts various trends to come while hiding, in symbolism, the true mechanisms at work. Indeed, several of these cards imply the existence of a ‘hidden hand’, an outside force that does not simply observe what is happening – it is silently guiding the world where it needs to go.",conspiracy
132,"The self-harming suspect was obviously a nervous wreck prior to paying his attackers, those two Nigerian brothers, both body builders and, judging from their remarks, devout Christians, who graduated from a small Franciscan college in Illinois. Smollett, a thin-framed and emotionally sensitive gay, had befriended the Nigerian pair, not for homosexual motives but for only possible reason: physical protection against the threat of serious harm that he was facing. His fears, as traced here, were not due to white racism but caused by sinister pressures from aggressive black gays linked to a demon-worshiping cult that has infiltrated the hip hop scene and African-American film productions.

By orchestrating this staged attack, Smollett was obviously aiming for police protection for himself and the children of his siblings against the demands of voodoo cultists for child-sacrifice victims, as has already been experienced by one of his co-stars, the comedienne Mo’Nique, who has been blacklisted from movie roles for defiantly claiming that she expects to be murdered for her resistance to the cult underworld.

The Hollywood cult demanding child sacrifices from African-American artists runs parallel with the Satanic force that has snuffed white actors David Carradine, Heath Ledger and Chris Penn, forcing Randy Quaid to flee to Canada as a fugitive, where Her Majesty’s imperial agents refused him and his wife refugee status in the same British Columbia that launched 15 feet of young males shod in sneakers floating down Puget Sound. And let’s not forget the unsolved deaths of River Phoenix, Kate Spade and Debra Jean Palfrey and, of course, Anthony Bourdain in this harvest of parts unknown.

Smollett’s complaint about a diminishing salary for his role in “Empire” echoes the Quaid claims of shrinking royalties and underpaid bit parts in retaliation for his refusal to crawl before Satan. Now with the herd instinct causing Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo and AOL to stampede into online entertainment media, the Hollywood coven has its fangs set on takeover of the Big Tech industry, which will mean that the US Mint will soon have to issue brand-new dollars with the motto: “To Satan we kneel”. There’s something rotten and murderous in Burbank and Hollywood that require nothing less than an old-style Inquisition to flush the coven out into the light of day.

As a nice kid who cracked under pressure, Smollett is now the target for termination in or out of prison. Instead of spouting the ultra-liberal melody of the Clinton chorus, Jussie should have cut the shucking and jiving and gone to a gun range to improve his aim, and invited his family to learn rapid-fire self-defense against the common menace of the coven, which unlike vampires in the movies is not immune to a hail of lead.

The Nigerian musclemen were a poor substitute for professional bodyguards, coming from the political elite of their African nation, their father being an executive of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), which put Gen. Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan into the presidency. Their voluntary return to Chicago after fleeing to their homeland was therefore the price of political support from Washington for their father, who a prince of a major tribal group. Whatever the absurdity of their ski-masked play-acting, that’s now irrelevant to the present danger of the voodoo ring, which includes as one of chief suspects Lee Daniels, the creator of Empire, with his multiple contacts inside the Clinton machine, including the deep-cover CIA ops that pulled off the 2016 Orlando disco massacre. On the video project sponsored by the elitist Clintonista LGBT lobby HRC (Human Rights Campaign) Daniels worked with white gay producer Ryan Murphy (FX, GLEE series) to present the responses of 49 celebrities to the Orlando Pulse killings in support of gun control. By contrast, non-compromised security experts analyze this false-flag attack as an inside job assigned to a team of at least three assailants and not the sole ISIS gunman Omar Mateen as falsely claimed by the mainstream media. His background in the cover-up of a covert operation is informative as to Daniels’ treacherous role in the Smollett affair.

As creator of “Empire”, Lee Daniels reacted to news of the Smollett “lynching” with an overheated condemnation of white racism that smacked of insincerity from that Clinton-tamed house negro with his insatiable appetite for young gay flesh. In feigned affection, he expressed his feelings for Jussie Smollett by saying: “You are my son”. What exactly that might mean when the two were “dating” is hardly assuring. Any “father” who reams his “son” is a pedophile or in this case a black gay casting-couch equivalent of Harvey Weinstein. Daniel’s own father was a Philly police officer who tried, in Lee’s words, “to beat the gay out of me” but soon thereafter was shot dead. This could be the plot for a Greek tragedy titled Homo Oedipus.

Lee Daniels, writer and producer, soared to fame with his production “Monster’s Ball”, (2001) which reached climax with the high-tone Halle Barry being sodomized by a older white male. Former president Bill Clinton was excited enough about that interracial scene that he personally asked Daniels to produce public service announcements (PSAs) encouraging young people to vote Democrat, a project featuring hip hop star LL Cool J and feminista Alicia Keyes. Suddenly IR rear-door became a political movement.

After producing a series of forgettable movies, other than his Oscar-winning “Precious” (2009), Daniels re-emerged in the public interest sector with a documentary on the Orlando gay nightclub shooting, sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the world’s largest LGBT rights group. HRC endorsed Bill Clinton for president in 1992, showing its cards to be an Establishment insider operation. Later HRC endorsed closet lesbian candidate Hillary Clinton, but then revealed its treachery to principles by backing Andrew Cuomo and not Cynthia Nixon (the people’s choice regardless of sexual identity or feminism if the only ethical standard is fairness, smarts and ability to communicate). So in a nutshell, Lee Daniels is the house Negro or to put it into race-blind parlance, an Agency influencer for the Pizzagate crowd.

The Daniels-directed “Precious” (2009), an uplifting “victim into heroine story” about an obese pregnant black girl in Harlem whose father dies of AIDS, with funding from philanthropist Gary Magness’s Smokewood Entertainment. Smokewood, get it, like a chewy cigar, has been the defendant in a contract-infringement lawsuit by the Weinstein Corporation. The counterattack in that copyright theft is Lee Daniels teaming with comedienne Whitney Cummings to smoke out Weinstein in an upcoming project titled “#MeToo”. I never thought that in a million years of ever siding with the casting-couch offender but this cynical exploitation of moral outrage is dirty pool. BTW, Cummings is one of the crew that took down Roseanne Barr, nice Company.

After graduating a Midwest university, I had to get a real job at steel mills in Gary, Indiana, and then US Steel Southworks, which that carpetbagger Barack Obama used as an example of the Rust Belt being in need of uplift through suburbanization. The ghost of Southworks is the very symbol of the sell-out of the American industrial economy by the globalist bankers. Remember Lou Rawls singing about “the hawk”, the chill wind off Lake Michigan in winter slamming into the Southside? It is the chilliest black neighborhood in the world, which means a no-nonsense attitude to the challenges in life.

As stated to Smollett at the arraignment by a true-to-life Chicagoan, Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr., who is black: “The most vile and despicable part of it, if it’s true, is the noose (since) that symbol conjures up such evil in this country’s history.” Strange fruit, indeed, is Mr. Smollett twisting in the wind, who wants white folks’ protection against demented Afro-cultists and hopes to achieve that by guilt-tripping them with a lynch rope. I understand your desperation, kid, but all you have to do is ask for help. After hearing your sad story, even Klan members will shake their heads and back you up.

An African-American police superintendent chimed in: “It’s just despicable. It makes you wonder what’s going on in someone’s mind to be able to do something like that. I’m left hanging my head and asking why? Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?”

As the brother just said, Jussie, how low can you go? To save the whities the trouble, I’d truss you up but there aren’t trees in the part of South Central where I grew up, just telephone poles. If you really want to get lynched, it’s just a couple hours drive out of Chicago to the heart of Indiana, where I used to walk to campus ducking empty beer cans tossed my way by KKK drive-bys. Those good ole boys’ll be more than happy to oblige your darkest desires at one of those iron bridges that crosses the Wabash. Since ya’ll are proud to be gay, the riverside party’s going to start with that “sooey-sooey” hog-calling scene from “Deliverance”.

OK, let’s ease up on poor Jussie. So I’m going to step out of my mean-streets childhood identity in South-Central and drop those Hoosierisms in castigating his disgrace on an undeserving black community, and revert back into my ultra-polite over-civilized Japanese roots to lay out who’s clinically responsible for Smollett’s mental issues that generated masochistic fantasies. So from here-on in, my plea is in the defense of Jussie Langston Mikha Smollett, aka the character Jamal Lyon (pronounced “lyin’) in the Fox series ‘Empire’.” Fox? Calm down, folks, Jussie’s late father was Jewish, so Fuchs or whatever you call that Orthodox Zionist neocon psy-op network is appropriate.

What’s been disclosed so far has been very little about the Jewish immigrant from Russia and Poland who worked as cable splicer, Joel Smollett Sr., the father of 4 sons and 2 daughters, all of them child actors and later producers or musicians. All the Smollet children were featured in the cast of the sit-com “On Our Own”. Smollett Sr. died from cancer at age 58 on the night that “Empire” premiered on Fox, 5 January 2015, as if by strange destiny.

The given names of the five siblings all begin with a “J”, an instant code for hiring in an American entertainment industry under control of Ashkenazi Jews: Jussie, Jake, Jazz, Jocqui, Jojo and Jurnee. The Kabbalist precedent for the letter “J” is “Yod”, the smallest character of the Hebrew alphabet and symbol of their no-name God. The family J was cast for the Disney movie about the Anaheim hockey team “The Mighty Ducks”. Hello, you little child actors, who wants to chase after a puck? The lack of physical resemblance between the J kids, skin tones ranges from high yellow to deep ochre, raises some disturbing questions, which I shall leave to the end of this crime analysis. All anyone knows about their daddy is that the kids refer to him as The King.

If Jussie felt underpaid by Fox, that’s just the way it goes for “schwartze”, even those blended into the Chosen. This legacy of cross-breeding with the Judaic community in America goes back to the commercial role of Charlestown British Jewry and French Jews in New Orleans in the cotton export to the Rothschild textile mills in Lancastershire and the African slave trade for the ante-bellum South. These cafe au lait bloodlines descend down through the jazz set of the Harlem Renaissance to present-day celebs like Boys II Men(sch), Drake (Aubrey Graham), the upfront exuberant Yiddish Whoopi Goldberg, and of course the great one who never tried to hide it, Lenny Kravitz. In contrast, Sammy Davis Jr. decided to convert when Meyer Lansky ran Vegas, go figure.

Dual identity was no big deal until Smollett came along and did his Woody Allen nebbish “God hates me” act. Which of the gods is anyone’s guess in voodoo. If you want to deter Daniels and the rest of those cultist creeps, why did you not go to synagogue and call for some firepower from the IDF, as in Parkland, Florida? The answer to that obvious point is: the Bronfman fortune that controls Lionsgate, which financed the Lee Daniels breakthrough film at Sundance titled “Precious: Based on the novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire”.

Lionsgate, controlled by the Canadian Zionist clan who made their fortune on liquor sales to the American ghettos, heavily funds in partnership with Goldman Sachs the New Orleans-born director Tyler Perry who bought the exclusive contract for the Oprah Winfrey Show, hired little sister Jurnee Smollett for “Temptation” and has produced “Daddy’s Little Girls” and his own “Madea” series starring himself cross-dressed as a tough old black lady. His whole project is the cultural castration of the black male, abetted by his financial patronage of Kim Kardashian, the one-woman Armenian subduer of the African legions with the display of her lethal assets. From one extreme of Bill Cosby, now the pendulum swings to Miss Maddy. The “trans”-formation of Afro maledom is nothing new, not since back in the 1970s when I had to walk cross-town New York between two night jobs past 8th Avenue lined by black tranny Amazons giving head to white guys in big cars from Jersey.

Since the ancient past of Malcolm X, H. Rap Brown and Stokely, whatever happened to black role models like that thuggish pimp Super Fly or my fav vampire killer Blade? Eldridge Cleaver with his black panther codpiece, that’s what happened, and then all the scared little black boys ran uptown and starting wearing dresses. Now that the big linebackers are on their knees begging for mercy from the cops, next comes the PC campaign against bearded white boys for “toxic masculinity”.

That leaves us little Asian guys with the kick-fast task called “Enter the Dragon” to stop this global shame-fest. The first task, gentlemen, before liberating our black schoolmates is the immediate rescue of the white girls held captive and IDed with branding irons by the Maria Abramovic-influenced Bronfman-run sex cult NXIVM pronounced Nexium, better known by the generic term Satanism.

The Smollett trial is happening in Hillary Rodham Clinton’s hometown where the Kenyan-Indonesian-Hawaiian Barack Obama was re-designed as a minority black activist. It gets worse. The legal defense team for Smollett is BreenPugh, headed by Todd Pugh (pronounced “phew”) and the venerable Thomas Breen, a former DA in the Chicago region. Attorney Pugh, a graduate of Florida Atlantic University (hear alarms bells ringing?) in Boca Raton, FL, and his first job was under the public defender’s office in Palm Beach and Broward Counties, DWS turf inherited from Meyer Lansky. (Read my Florida school shooting articles for the skivvy.) After relocating to Chicago, one of Pugh’s first cases was in pro bono defense in a retrial for Rolando Cruz on charges of raping and murdering a 10-year-old girl.

One of Pugh’s most recent cases was in defense of George Papadopoulos, the Russiagate suspect deeply involved in the Israeli oil-pipeline project in the Eastern Mediterranean and energy adviser to the neocon Hudson foundation. (my Russiagate series goes into his relationships with the MI-6 and his Rothschild-funded European socialist handlers.) So with a defense line-up with those connections, why does the court need a prosecution?

While the courtroom drama is happening in the Midwest, the defense strategy for Jussie Smollett is being crafted by a celebrity lawyer with the Los Angeles Bar Association named Mark Geragos (who is Armenian not Mexican). A contemporary of high-power American lawyer Robert Kardashian, Geragos shot to national prominence through his representation of Susan McDougal, who was a partner with the Clintons in the Whitewater real estate scam along with her banker husband James. His out-of-court tactics cut short her prison sentence with a presidential pardon from Bill Clinton in the last hours of his White House term in 2001. Geragos was basically the trusted family counsel for the Clintons, winning also the release of the president’s roguish brother Roger from a DUI charge.

Geragos represented Michael Jackson against child-molestation charges and Palos Verdes millionaire Cameron Brown who tossed his 4-year-old daughter off a seaside cliff. One of his more gruesome cases was in defense of a low-life yakuza “businessman” for the gunshot murder of his wife (his second lover lethally assailed), possibly linked to a larger sex-crime syndicate.

The celebrated lawyer also served as counsel for the Carradine family during the probe into the death of actor David Carradine in Bangkok, covered up by the media as an auto-erotic asphyxiation hanging. Note: I visited the hotel where the body was found hanged in a closet, with a rope tautly stretched between his neck and penis. The bellhops challenged that storyline, saying that the ladyboy who allegedly assisted the ropework was never present on site. The star of that legendary TV series “Kung Fu” had just arrived in Bangkok to meet artist-director Charles de Meaux for his role in the movie “Stretch” (as in rope, the sick joy in self-lynching for pleasure). According to bouncers in the Patpong nightlife district, two tall white men had been present on the evening of his death at that sin city’s only S&M club, which suggested his corpse was transported to the hotel room inside a large piece of luggage and then trussed up to appear as an unintended suicide. None of these details were ever released to the news media by the FBI unit posted at the US Embassy or the LA police, or by the Geragos law office. Two Thai coroners in Bangkok separately concluded Carradine’s death was not a suicide but an “accident”.

Geragos has been a frequent guest on the CNN show Anderson Cooper 360. He has also represented singer Chris Brown against Rihanna’s charges of assault. His most recent high-profile case was for former quarterback Colin Kaepernick against the NFL. His law firm’s fees are a minimum $500 per hour, plus a hefty share of any settlement.

Therefore, the question is: Who’s paying for Jussie Smollett’s legal fees? There are those few who’ve mastered the addition of 2 plus 2 who’ve noticed that publicity over the “white racist attack on Jussie” immediately took the heat off West LA Democrat fixer Ed Buck, whose living quarters contained the decaying bodies of two young gay blacks, whose deaths might well be attributed to overdoses of meth possibly in the heat of S&M.

The Goldwater website points out the silence from black Hollywood over these suspicious deaths, indicating Buck is something other than a Dem gay-rights activist. To paraphrase the site’s comments: “If you do an advanced search with the words Ed Buck and Jussie Smollett, you'll see that Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, Cory Booker, Ryan Jamaal, Zendaya, Cher, Ciara, Joe Biden, Alyssa Milano, Julian Castro, LL Cool J, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, and other politicians and celebrities jumped on the Jussie bandwagon, but are notoriously silent about Ed Buck.” In other words, Smollett’s idiotic stunt has just saved the holier-than-thou California Democrat multicultural establishment from the agony of a manslaughter rap against one of its elite white gay fundraisers.

My humble suggestion for the Chicago police force is to review records of deaths of young gays, or those gone missing, cases similar to the black men’s bodies inside Buck’s home, although with the astronomical death rate for young blacks in the Rahm Emanuel-Clinton-Obama Chicago machine dependent on the drug trade for their living, it’s going to be just a drop in a bucket of blood.

Now let’s lower all those gooey strings of cheese down onto a bed of crust and red sauce for this latest addition to our Pizzagate menu spiced up with peppery Satanic hot sauce from Brazil. The comedienne Mo’nique, who starred as the abusive mother in “Precious” has seen her career evaporate due to her refusal to surrender one of her children for a child sacrifice by the black voodoo ring that rules the hip hop scene. She’s complained of being blackballed by Oprah Winfrey, Lee Daniels and cross-dresser Tyler Perry, and has publicly stated that she is slated to be murdered by the Hollywood cabal. Remember Tupac Shakur, folks, cause the killing’s just beginning.

What has this voodoo cult scandal have to do with Jussie Smollet? For starters, at age 19 he landed his first major role in “The Skinny”, a film about 4 gay male students and one lesbian at Brown University on a weekend in New York City, which was directed by the extremely disturbed black gay director named Patrik Ian-Polk. The Mississippi-born indie director later released “Black Bird” starring Mo’Nique and co-produced by British-Caribbean gay talent Rikki Beadle-Blair, who was awarded an MBE by the Queen (that stands for Member of the Order of the British Empire). So we are dealing here with the Royal Blackguards, pronounced “blaggards” ever-ready to enforce her Her Satanic Majesty’s Request, and the same goes for that dread Lady Rihanna.

What could Mo’Nique and other frightened talents be so fearful of? Human sacrifice, usually children, to certain gods of the voodoo pantheon, for example, Kalfu the god of darkness and conspiracy who is the equivalent of Satan or the powerful death goddess Brigitte, who cannot be appeased with a decapitated chicken or stuck pig but demands a more powerful sacrifice. Perverse forms of the old African folk magic are flourishing across the tropical Americas, and merging with the Luciferian beliefs of the Illuminati, as the puritanical ethics of the European Christianity collapse under the secularism of the Jewish commercial class and its crass materialistic values. Following that shining example from the late Roman Empire set by the Bishop of Carthage and Hippo Augustine, those among us who intend to prevent the collapse of Western civilization now face the same challenge of standing down the occult belief systems or another Dark Age will surely engulf the world.

Now that the heat on the cheese, sausages and herbs is starting to puddle into a pizza, it’s time to toss on the chile peppers. The oldest Smollett sibling Jussie was born in Santa Rosa, Rio Grande do Sul, which is the heartland of Brazil’s blood sacrifice cult known as Oro, or by anthropologists “Candomble”, which has a sharper edge than Louisiana Voodoo. The southernmost region of Brazil, which is closer to Buenos Aires and Montevideo, Uruguay, than to Rio or Sao Paolo, was ruled by the Jesuit order until national independence. That region was one of the secret routes for the postwar “rat lines” for SS officers and their Jewish collaborators on medical experiments in the labor camps, leaving a legacy of organ harvesting and child abductions that continues to this very minute. (Go over my article on Oprah Winfrey and her since-arrested lover, a Brazilian healer and child abductor, at rense.com to comprehend the extent and power of human-sacrifice and pedophilia cultism in that God-forsaken society that chosen the deepest darkest African cultism over the moral legacy of Jesus and his disciples.)

So what about the whereabouts of Papa Joel Smollett en route from Eastern Europe through Latin America on his journey to Southern California, as indicated by the June 1983 birth date of Jussie, born in Brazil and later issued a birth certificate in Santa Rosa, California, another fake American like Barack Obama. Called The King by his brood, there is no trace on record of Joel’s mystery years, when the Russian Mafia was emerging out of a collapsing Soviet Union in inextricable economic crisis, at the same time that organ trafficking and the child-sex trade were growing like wild vines in the Brazilian jungles.

What could he be doing, a Jewish immigrant from Poland and Russia, in southern Brazil, surely not stringing cable for Worldcomm or Cisco. The surname derives from Smolensk, a Russian city defended by the Tsars against invasions by the Polish-Lithuanian Confederation for which the treacherous Khazarian Jews from Rus Ukraine served as guides, translators, progandists and saboteurs for the aggressors against Mother Russia. Beside opening a strategic corridor, the invaders aimed to seize Kristall Smolensk, Russia’s major diamond-facet cutting center.

Papa Joel was likely smuggling gems for the Russian mafiya into the Americas, a salesmanship role that would have led to world’s richest diamond market, Southern California. Stuffing babies and children with sacks of diamonds was, of course, the sure-bet way of getting past customs at LAX. Here, the movie industry eagerness to hire the Smollett kids was part of the deal by the Russian Mafia to launder ill-gotten money through the major Hollywood studios.

Along the path these cookie crumbs indicate, the only way to save Jussie Smollett is for him to be kept under the watchful eye of federal prosecutors who are not on the Clinton payroll as bait for those who are haunting him and desperate to get him back in their clutches. Mo’Nique and Smollett plus his siblings need witness protection, until all the spirit-cooking cultists are eliminated from Hollywood and the Democratic Party and from inside the major news media, starting with CNN.

As for the treacherous African-American talents who have cashed in for silver their ancestors’ quest for dignity and salvation from the indecency of slavery, let these colored Judases be damned to spend the rest of their short lives inside a high-security prison and after that an eternity in the bosom of Satan. Never mind global warming as compared with the seasonal temperatures in Hell. Though you should not be coerced to believe, God as referred to in the Constitution and on the US dollar, as a beneficent spiritual presence opposed to superstitious fear and hatred, is part of a well-conceived grand design to keep us from going pathologically insane. Save the children from their tormentors.",conspiracy
497,"The psychedelic drug DMT produces an effect in the brain similar to that felt by people undergoing near-death experiences, according to a new study.

A powerful hallucinogen, the substance is widely used for ceremonial purposes in South America as part of the brew known as ayahuasca.

Though the drug is illegal in most countries, its connection with spirituality is widely acknowledged and has earned it the nickname “the spirit molecule”.

Near-death experiences (NDEs) are psychological events often reported by those who think they are about to die, and can include out of body experiences, feelings of transitioning to another world and inner peace.

As similar feelings are often reported by DMT users, researchers at Imperial College London wanted to investigate how deep the connection between these experiences went.

In a trial of 13 healthy volunteers, doses of either the drug or a placebo were administered intravenously over the course of two sessions.

Their reactions to the drug were then compared with the experiences of 67 people who had previously reported NDEs and completed standardised questionnaires to document what had happened to them.

After their sessions, the DMT users were asked questions such as “Did scenes from your past come back to you?” and “Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?”.

The similarities between the responses of those who had taken DMT and those who had come close to death confirmed the anecdotal evidence from users of the psychedelic drug – that it is indeed able to mimic the effect of an NDE.

“Our findings show a striking similarity between the types of experiences people are having when they take DMT and people who have reported a near-death experience,” said PhD candidate Chris Timmermann, the first author of the study.

Ex-government drugs tsar Professor David Nutt, who also contributed to the research, said the data suggested “the well-recognised life-changing effects of both DMT and NDE might have the same neuroscientific basis.”

Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, who leads the Imperial College psychedelic research group and supervised the study, which was conducted as part of the Beckley-Imperial Research Program, said: “DMT is a remarkable tool that can enable us to study and thus better understand the psychology and biology of dying.”

However, the researchers noted there were some subtle differences between the two experiences, with DMT users more likely to describe “entering an unearthly realm” rather than the more ominous “coming to a point of no return” reported by people experiencing NDEs.

The scientists said these distinctions may have been the result of the rigorous screening and preparation that preceded DMT dosing in these experiments.

The results of their study were published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.

Psychedelic drugs such as DMT and LSD have previously been linked with improvements in mental health, and scientists have suggested illegal drugs have the potential to become the next generation of antidepressants.

While the Imperial scientists said their results added an intriguing dimension to this story, they advised against any self-medication by the general public.

“We hope to conduct further studies to measure the changes in brain activity that occur when people have taken the compound,” said Mr Timmermann.

“This, together with other work, will help us to explore not only the effects on the brain, but whether they might possibly be of medicinal benefit in future.”",mainstream
995,"What Is the Dark Web?

The dark web refers to encrypted online content that is not indexed by conventional search engines. Sometimes, the dark web is also called the dark net. The dark web is a component of the deep web that describes the wider breadth of content that does not appear through regular Internet browsing activities. Most deep web content consists of private files hosted on Dropbox and its competitors or subscriber-only databases rather than anything illegal.

Specific browsers, such as Tor Browser, are required to reach the dark web. Using the dark web often provides considerably more privacy than just using Tor to access the web. Many dark web sites simply provide standard web services with more secrecy, which benefits political dissidents and people trying to keep medical conditions private. Unfortunately, online marketplaces for drugs, exchanges for stolen data, and other illegal activities get most of the attention.

In many ways, the dark web is much like the broader web was in its early days during the late 20th century. There is a lot of material about getting it working, and not very much to do once one gets there. A lot of the content on the dark web is very amateurish. On the other hand, it is much easier for individuals to start sites and get attention. Tech giants and large media organizations have very little influence on the dark web as of 2020.

As with the early Internet, the dark web has also gained a reputation as a haven for illegal activities. The dark web, like the web before it, is frequently blamed for horrible crimes, such as child abuse and murder for hire. However, these crimes existed long before the Internet or the dark web. The Internet actually helped to promote tolerance in the late 20th century, when many laws discriminated against alternative lifestyles. Similarly, drugs once sold illegally on the dark web are increasingly being decriminalized. The dark web makes it harder to enforce both just and unjust laws.

It is crucial to avoid confusing the dark web with the cryptocurrencies often used to make purchases there. The dark web makes it easier to set up and access websites that offer a high degree of anonymity for everyone involved. Many of these sites contain only information, with no ability to buy or sell anything. It is true that cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Monero, are often used for transactions on the dark web. However, one does not have to use the dark web to use cryptocurrencies.

The dark web and the deep web are also often erroneously used interchangeably. The deep web includes all the pages that don’t pop up when you run a web search. The dark web is just one part of the deep web. The deep web also contains everything requiring a login, such as online banking, pay sites, and file hosting services.

The dark web helps people to maintain privacy and freely express their views. Privacy is essential for many innocent people terrorized by stalkers and other criminals. The increasing tendency of potential employers to track posts on social media can also make it difficult to engage in honest discussions publicly. Finally, the popularity of the dark web with criminals makes it a perfect way for undercover police officers to communicate.

The dark web empowers ordinary people, but some people will inevitably abuse that power. The dark web can make it easier to commit some of the worst crimes. For example, the combination of the dark web and cryptocurrencies theoretically makes it much easier to hire someone to commit a murder. While the dark web promises privacy to its users, it can also be used to violate the privacy of others. Private photos, medical records, and financial information have all been stolen and shared on the dark web.",mainstream
287,"“Expect the media to attack me tomorrow in a way you have never seen. Godspeed.” So Mike Cernovich, a self-described “writer, filmmaker and journalist” better known as an alt-Right provocateur, posted on Thursday, hours after he had resurrected decade-old, damning Tweets from Hollywood filmmaker James Gunn. Having created a few himself, Cernovich is familiar with media storms. But in three days he has sparked the downfall of Disney’s golden goose, creating a division at the heart of Hollywood that has left the industry reeling.

Because James Gunn, the man responsible for writing and directing both Guardians of the Galaxy films (which grossed $773 million and $863 million worldwide, respectively) has now been fired by Disney, and the studio’s most heavyweight stars – Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista, among them – are standing by him. The future of Guardians of the Galaxy 3, which Gunn had written and was due to direct, remains perilously in limbo - as does that of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.

This is a major hurricane to emerge from Cernovich’s fluttering of butterfly wings, even by his standards. At the end of 2016, Cernovich’s persistent promotion of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory – which erroneously posited that high-ranking officials of the Democratic Party were running a child sex ring covered up by pizza restaurants – led to a man firing a rifle in a pizzeria in Brooklyn.",mainstream
207,"My name is Tetyana Obukhanych. I hold a PhD in Immunology. I am writing this letter in the hope that it will correct several common misperceptions about vaccines in order to help you formulate a fair and balanced understanding that is supported by accepted vaccine theory and new scientific findings.

Do unvaccinated children pose a higher threat to the public than the vaccinated?

It is often stated that those who choose not to vaccinate their children for reasons of conscience endanger the rest of the public, and this is the rationale behind most of the legislation to end vaccine exemptions currently being considered by federal and state legislators country-wide.

You should be aware that the nature of protection afforded by many modern vaccines – and that includes most of the vaccines recommended by the CDC for children – is not consistent with such a statement.

I have outlined below the recommended vaccines that cannot prevent transmission of disease either because they are not designed to prevent the transmission of infection (rather, they are intended to prevent disease symptoms), or because they are for non-communicable diseases.

People who have not received the vaccines mentioned below pose no higher threat to the general public than those who have, implying that discrimination against non-immunized children in a public school setting may not be warranted.

IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine) cannot prevent transmission of poliovirus. Wild poliovirus has been non-existent in the USA for at least two decades.

Even if wild poliovirus were to be re-imported by travel, vaccinating for polio with IPV cannot affect the safety of public spaces.

Please note that wild poliovirus eradication is attributed to the use of a different vaccine, OPV or oral poliovirus vaccine. Despite being capable of preventing wild poliovirus transmission, use of OPV was phased out long ago in the USA and replaced with IPV due to safety concerns.

Tetanus is not a contagious disease, but rather acquired from deep-puncture wounds contaminated with C. tetani spores. Vaccinating for tetanus (via the DTaP combination vaccine) cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is intended to render personal protection only.

While intended to prevent the disease-causing effects of the diphtheria toxin, the diphtheria toxoid vaccine (also contained in the DTaP vaccine) is not designed to prevent colonization and transmission of C. diphtheriae. Vaccinating for diphtheria cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is likewise intended for personal protection only.

The acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine (the final element of the DTaP combined vaccine), now in use in the USA, replaced the whole cell pertussis vaccine in the late 1990s, which was followed by an unprecedented resurgence of whooping cough.

An experiment with deliberate pertussis infection in primates revealed that the aP vaccine is not capable of preventing colonization and transmission of B. pertussis. The FDA has issued a warning regarding this crucial finding.

Furthermore, the 2013 meeting of the Board of Scientific Counselors at the CDC revealed additional alarming data that pertussis variants (PRN-negative strains) currently circulating in the USA acquired a selective advantage to infect those who are up-to-date for their DTaP boosters, meaning that people who are up-to-date are more likely to be infected, and thus contagious, than people who are not vaccinated.

Among numerous types of H. influenzae, the Hib vaccine covers only type b. Despite its sole intention to reduce symptomatic and asymptomatic (disease-less) Hib carriage, the introduction of the Hib vaccine has inadvertently shifted strain dominance towards other types of H. influenzae (types a through f).

These types have been causing invasive disease of high severity and increasing incidence in adults in the era of Hib vaccination of children. The general population is more vulnerable to the invasive disease now than it was prior to the start of the Hib vaccination campaign.

Discriminating against children who are not vaccinated for Hib does not make any scientific sense in the era of non-type b H. influenzae disease.

Hepatitis B is a blood-borne virus. It does not spread in a community setting, especially among children who are unlikely to engage in high-risk behaviors, such as needle sharing or sex.

Vaccinating children for hepatitis B cannot significantly alter the safety of public spaces.

Further, school admission is not prohibited for children who are chronic hepatitis B carriers. To prohibit school admission for those who are simply unvaccinated – and do not even carry hepatitis B – would constitute unreasonable and illogical discrimination.

In summary, a person who is not vaccinated with IPV, DTaP, HepB, and Hib vaccines due to reasons of conscience poses no extra danger to the public than a person who is. No discrimination is warranted.

How often do serious vaccine adverse events happen?

It is often stated that vaccination rarely leads to serious adverse events. Unfortunately, this statement is not supported by science.

A recent study done in Ontario, Canada, established that vaccination actually leads to an emergency room visit for 1 in 168 children following their 12-month vaccination appointment and for 1 in 730 children following their 18-month vaccination appointment.

When the risk of an adverse event requiring an ER visit after well-baby vaccinations is demonstrably so high, vaccination must remain a choice for parents, who may understandably be unwilling to assume this immediate risk in order to protect their children from diseases that are generally considered mild or that their children may never be exposed to.

Can discrimination against families who oppose vaccines for reasons of conscience prevent future disease outbreaks of communicable viral diseases, such as measles?

Measles research scientists have for a long time been aware of the “measles paradox.” I quote from the article by Poland & Jacobson (1994) “Failure to Reach the Goal of Measles Elimination: Apparent Paradox of Measles Infections in Immunized Persons.”

“The apparent paradox is that as measles immunization rates rise to high levels in a population, measles becomes a disease of immunized persons.”

Further research determined that behind the “measles paradox” is a fraction of the population called low vaccine responders.

Low-responders are those who respond poorly to the first dose of the measles vaccine. These individuals then mount a weak immune response to subsequent RE-vaccination and quickly return to the pool of “susceptibles” within 2-5 years, despite being fully vaccinated.

Re-vaccination cannot correct low-responsiveness: it appears to be an immuno-genetic trait. The proportion of low-responders among children was estimated to be 4.7% in the USA.

Studies of measles outbreaks in Quebec, Canada, and China attest that outbreaks of measles still happen, even when vaccination compliance is in the highest bracket (95-97% or even 99%). This is because even in high vaccine responders, vaccine-induced antibodies wane over time. Vaccine immunity does not equal life-long immunity acquired after natural exposure.

It has been documented that vaccinated persons who develop breakthrough measles are contagious. In fact, two major measles outbreaks in 2011 (in Quebec, Canada, and in New York, NY) were re-imported by previously vaccinated individuals.

Taken together, these data make it apparent that elimination of vaccine exemptions, currently only utilized by a small percentage of families anyway, will neither solve the problem of disease resurgence nor prevent re-importation and outbreaks of previously eliminated diseases.

Is discrimination against conscientious vaccine objectors the only practical solution?

The majority of measles cases in recent US outbreaks (including the recent Disneyland outbreak) are adults and very young babies, whereas in the pre-vaccination era, measles occurred mainly between the ages 1 and 15.

Natural exposure to measles was followed by lifelong immunity from re-infection, whereas vaccine immunity wanes over time, leaving adults unprotected by their childhood shots. Measles is more dangerous for infants and for adults than for school-aged children.

Despite high chances of exposure in the pre-vaccination era, measles practically never happened in babies much younger than one year of age due to the robust maternal immunity transfer mechanism.

The vulnerability of very young babies to measles today is the direct outcome of the prolonged mass vaccination campaign of the past, during which their mothers, themselves vaccinated in their childhood, were not able to experience measles naturally at a safe school age and establish the lifelong immunity that would also be transferred to their babies and protect them from measles for the first year of life.

Luckily, a therapeutic backup exists to mimic now-eroded maternal immunity. Infants as well as other vulnerable or immunocompromised individuals, are eligible to receive immunoglobulin, a potentially life-saving measure that supplies antibodies directed against the virus to prevent or ameliorate disease upon exposure.

1) due to the properties of modern vaccines, non-vaccinated individuals pose no greater risk of transmission of polio, diphtheria, pertussis, and numerous non-type b H. influenzae strains than vaccinated individuals do, non-vaccinated individuals pose virtually no danger of transmission of hepatitis B in a school setting, and tetanus is not transmissible at all;

2) there is a significantly elevated risk of emergency room visits after childhood vaccination appointments attesting that vaccination is not risk-free;

3) outbreaks of measles cannot be entirely prevented even if we had nearly perfect vaccination compliance; and

4) an effective method of preventing measles and other viral diseases in vaccine-ineligible infants and the immunocompromised, immunoglobulin, is available for those who may be exposed to these diseases.

Taken together, these four facts make it clear that discrimination in a public school setting against children who are not vaccinated for reasons of conscience is completely unwarranted as the vaccine status of conscientious objectors poses no undue public health risk.

1165,"This far into impeachment poker, the cards are down and dirty as so's Adam Schiff in his closet gay playground in West Hollywood. The head of the Senate Intelligence Committee turns out to be a back-door man on the receiving end when it comes to secret weapons shipments to Ukraine and a helicopter crash arranged to cover-up his role in the death of a black gay lover in West Hollywood. Recently returned from a long stint in East Asia, I've been surprised, although not stunned, to discover Schiff's bug eyes must've have protruded due to those L.A. rams, the black sheep with the rough trade out of Maxine Waters' district of Compton and Watts, aka Pizzagate West. The home-field for the Ukraine controversy is inextricably linked to drugged-out interracial gay homicides in Southern California, as exemplified by his fellow Democrat Ed Buck, pinned to the meth-overdose deaths of three black male sex partners, and as we discover more recently Congressman Adam Schiff, who is suspected of arranging the disposal by acid bath of a black gay lover flushed into the sewer at the Standard Hotel in West Hollywood. Further below Schiff's criminal ties with a Jewish Ukrainian gun-runner, a Democratic Party funder whose fleet of airships conduct 24X7 surveillance over the US-Mexico border without any objections from the Dem Hispanic caucus or AOC-plus-3. California's the hip place, as in hypocrisy. The R44 Raven helicopter that crashed on three houses in Newport Beach shortly before 2 p.m. on 30 January 2018 did not emit a distress signal, according to the FAA, as it tumbled out of the sky a mile from takeoff at John Wayne Airport. The three passengers killed en route to Catalina Island were Kimberly Lynn Watzman, manager of the Standard Hotel in West Hollywood; Brian Reichelt, the hotel chain's regional financial manager; and Spain-born Joseph Anthony Tena, CEO of the Ferrada Group, which owned shares in the Standard Hotels chain. Tena's business partner was Andre Balazs, the founder of the Standard Hotel chain and a pioneer in high-end boutique hotels. The helicopter had been inspected by an FAA team during the past summer resulting in installation of new parts, meaning the helicopter was in good condition. The 4-seat Robinson-built aircraft was leased by Revolution Aviation, a local flight school and touring company, from Eric Spitzer, who owns 70 helicopters operated out of Riverside County, who otherwise has zero biographical record or company history. Which gets to Andre Balazs, who is the son of Endre Balazs, a Hungarian Jew who resided unscathed in Budapest, just like George Soros and his father, while conducting ""medical research"" throughout the Nazi period before moving in 1947 to Stockholm and then on to Harvard, Boston Biomedical and then Columbia Presbyterian hospital. Andre's first job was as press secretary to the sex scandal mired Bess Meyerson, the postwar Jewish poster girl. Living off his father's fortune from developing hyalauric acid for knee-joint problems, Andre patronized heroin-addicted artist Andy Warhol and invested in the 1980s Manhattan dinner club M.K. and the LA supper club, b.c., where the main item off the menu was a line of cocaine. Then in the late-1980s, Balazs founded the Standard chain, a thinly covered establishment for bonking Craig's List girls and Tinder dates and being bonked by rough boys. All along, he cultivated a reputation for public groping that rivals Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein, likely to cover a growing connoisseurship for the gay lifestyle, as expressed in the aesthetics of his Standard operations in California and the Chiltern Firehouse hotel in London. Balazs, with his connections to drug lords and foreign politicians, including many from Israel, had Adam Schiff by the balls after the death of a young black male in the West Hollywood Standard. Hotel manager Kim Waltzman, 47 years old at the time of the helicopter crash, was an adventurer who loved nothing more than traveling to remote parts of the world and stood to gain early retirement by squeezing Balazs with the threat of exposing Schiff's murderous ""accident"" in a Standard bed. Thereafter the helicopter jaunt to Catalina Island with the corporate financial officer Brian Reichelt, aboard to sign the nondisclosure agreement on behalf of Balazs, does make perfect sense, and so does the mysterious crash that killed both of them. Ed Buck was not as lucky as Schiff, mainly because he injected his homeless black victims inside his own living room in West Hollywood's gay quarters. Now get this: Buck, Schiff and California Democratic Party Chair Eric Baum were simultaneously board members of the Stonewall Democratic Club, the LGBT political caucus. The predilection for dark meat makes Pizzagate West more rancid than the original cheesy sausage-filled Podesta concoction, although both scandals involve the same players Marina Abramovic and Jimmy Alefantis in hipster Balatz's social circle. Tony Podesta hosted a 2009 fund-raising reception for Adam Schiff at this art-packed home in Washington D.C. Out next East European Jewish high-flyer on the Schiff List is his constituent and campaign fundraiser Igor Pasternak, the Ukrainian gun-runner and blimp producer for DARPA and CIA special ops. Congressman Schiff's Igor is a major investor, tech transfer agent and delivery service for UkrOboronProm (UOP), a Ukrainian arms company, which produces automatic rifles based on the AR-15 called the WAC-47 for use by the armies of Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania, even though it's street-illegal in America, you shifty Democrat supports of gun control! Considering the history of Ukrainian arms-transfers, it won't be long before the WAC-47 will be whacking villagers in Africa and Latin America. The Obama-era Pentagon financed the design and production of this assault rifle with ammo compatible with the M-16 and NATO firearms in order to wean the Ukrainians off their home-built AK-47s. Igor Pasternak's blimp company Worldwide Aeros, based at the U.S. Marine Corps airfield in Tustin, CA (near San Bernadino), has received millions in grants from DARPA and other Pentagon agencies to develop an airship used for surveillance on the borders of Ukraine-Russia and Mexico-USA, another excellent achievement for Democrat hypocrisy. Who needs a wall when sky ""Dragons"" as these military airships are called suffice as infrared camera mounts and, when the right time comes, firing platforms for Gatling guns. Do you recall all the news stories about UFOs snake-dancing in the night sky? Those are Aeros Dragons, linked together like flying train cars. The 2013 campaign fundraiser for Rep. Adam Schiff at the Montebello mansion of Igor Pasternak, with donations by the invited starting at S2,500, is by now infamous, an outright payback from an arms dealer in exchange for contracts from the Defense Department. Schiff is well-known in Southern California as a Pentagon slut, connecting the military, NSA and CIA with the Pasadena-based defense contractor Parsons Corporation. Among its finest achievements under a U.S. government contract was to decommission the Libyan chemical-weapons facilities, which were dismantled for export to Ukraine, while barrels of lethal product ended up in the hands of ISIS rebels in Syria. Parsons botched a Pentagon contract in the wake of the Iraq invasion to build dozens of medical clinics, completing only two centers, both beset by basic design flaws, and then absconding with the money. After mismanagement of a road construction project for CalTrans (Calfornia State's transportation authority), Parsons fell into a deep financial hole but was saved through lucrative DARPA contracts arranged by Rep. Schiff, enabling takeovers of taxpayer-funded DARPA spin-offs Polaris Alpha (artificial intelligence command of complex battlefields), QRC (AI for special operations and Navy SEALS). and OGSystems (imaging and data analytics). These transactions for lethal weaponry in Ukraine and here in the USA prove with an iota of doubt that Adam Schiff is a merchant of death, the Joker himself who is now out to character-assassinate President Donald Trump. Yet there is one death that still haunts him, the young black man who suffered a drug-induced seizure while pumping the congressman's rump at the Standard Hotel, just a few blocks from the home of Ed Buck. Before ridding my desktop of all traces of Adam the Shifty, allow me to examine the family names Schiff and Pasternak in my usual manner of leaving no obscure detail untended. Rep. Adam Schiff is not a descendant of the war-criminal banker Jacob Shiff whose family was based in Frankfurt, Germany, as part of the occult movement led by Jacob Frank, which explains the congressman's constant money-grubbing from the vilest sort of funders in exchange for services rendered. His family origins are in Vilnius, Lithuania, a long-time historical center for anti-Russian warmongering. This anti-Russian campaign of invasion and subversion came to a head with the appearance of the third ""False Dimitry"", a Lithuanian Jewish vagabond who claimed to be Tsar Dimitry Ivanovich. The bold-faced liar rallied Cossacks to his cause with the promise of looting the cathedral of Moscovy, then ruled by the Tatar paladin Boris Gudonov. The Jewish faker send cavalrymen to assassinate the legitimate Russian ruler, Mikhail the founder of the Romanov dynasty. After falling out of God's grace, Dimitry was captured and then executed, his physical remains scattered to prevent his brain-washed followers from worshiping his bones. This is a parable for the mind-addled Democrats who accept all the falsehoods from Adam Schiff's mouth. They who deceive spin the lies you believe. Igor Pasternak's surname has resonance being that of Boris Pasternak, author of ""Dr. Zhivago"", the romantic tale of love (with the fallen heroine Lara). Aside from this novel, which perhaps did not deserve a Nobel Prize due to its retrogressive sentimentality, author Pasternak translated the works of Goethe, the leading Illuminati of the 19th century who warned of his youthful obsession with sorcery in the novel ""Faust"". The Russian writer was involved in Russian Futurism, a movement whose painters indulged in the Goethe-Illuminati theory of light and colors, reflection being a core concept of Luciferian reception (of inner light). The Grand Lodge of the Orient headquartered in France had a widespread Russian following in lodges since at least the mid-19 century among Russian officers returning from the post-Napoleonic occupation of Paris.The Grand Lodge of Ukraine was revived in the mid-1980s by Juliano di Bernardo, the grand master of the Italian Grand Lodge of the Orient and later received recognition from the central Grand Lodge of the Orient. The rationalist Freemasons in the English-speaking realm may have misgivings about the strange doctrines of the Grand Lodge of the Orient (meaning the East, in the direction of Morning Star, Lucifer) and their deep dark secrecy is due to the fact that the Grand Orient lodge does not stipulate belief in God or the Deity as the Supreme Being, as do American and British lodges, but instead worships Lucifer as the ruler of the Universe. 

 Igor Pasternak, although born in Soviet Kazahkstan, probably of a Jewish family evacuated by Stalin to Siberia, is not a descendant of the illustrious Pasternak clan of Moscow, but is a normal grubby Odessa Jew. The surname translates from Russian as ""parsnip"", a white carrot. His interest in ""lighter than air"" vehicles is not original or new, since the former USSR designed and constructed dozens of dirigibles before and during World War II. Like his Russian and Ukrainian predecessors, Pasternak has followed a ""crash and burn"" model of development, causing delays and cost overruns that forced him into gun-running and hustling his local congressman for defense contracts. If the mishaps at liftoff continue, Igor Pasternak could soon end up like Schiff's black stud, down the drain.",conspiracy

211,"The eighteenth season of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit debuted on Wednesday, September 21, 2016, on NBC[1] and finished on Wednesday, May 24, 2017, with a two-hour season finale.

Rick Eid, who previously worked on Law & Order and Law & Order: Trial by Jury, became the executive producer and showrunner, following Warren Leight's departure from the series at the conclusion of the seventeenth season. Eid himself departed the series at the end of the eighteenth season and was replaced by Michael S. Chernuchin.

Law & Order: Special Victims Unit was renewed for an eighteenth season on February 1, 2016, by NBC.[2] It was announced in March 2015 that season seventeen would be showrunner/executive producer Warren Leight's last season on the show; he signed a three-year deal with Sony Pictures Television, his contract allowing him to work on SVU for one final season.[3] On March 10, 2016, it was announced that Rick Eid would replace Leight as showrunner on this season.[4]

The 400th episode of the series aired this season. ""Motherly Love,"" directed by Mariska Hargitay, was filmed and billed as the 400th show. However, due to the shuffling of episodes during the season, the episode actually aired as the 399th episode. The 400th episode that was aired was the eleventh episode of the season, ""Great Expectations,"" which aired on NBC on February 15, 2017 (after being moved from its initial air date of November 9, 2016, and a second air date of January 4, 2017).

At the end of production of the season, during upfronts SVU was renewed for a nineteenth season. Following the renewal announcement, it was revealed that show runner/executive producer Rick Eid had departed the show. He took over Chicago P.D. as showrunner/EP starting with its fifth season, replacing C.P.D. co-creator/EP Matt Olmstead.[5] Michael Chernuchin, former showrunner and executive producer for Dick Wolf's Chicago Justice series, as well as a former executive producer and writer for many past incarnations of the Law & Order franchise, was selected as SVU's new showrunner.

It was announced at the end of the seventeenth season that recurring star Andy Karl (who portrayed Sergeant Mike Dodds) would be departing the cast due to his Broadway work. He was killed off on the season finale by corrupt corrections officer Gary Munson.[6]

It was announced on July 22, 2016, that SVU would do a ripped from the headlines episode based on Netflix documentary Making a Murderer. Henry Thomas appeared alongside Kelli Williams in the episode about a convicted rapist who is exonerated after DNA is freshly tested. Ice-T's character, Fin Tutuola, originally arrested Thomas' character 16 years earlier and then begins investigating him again when he is linked to a deadly crime. Williams played Melanie, a rape victim who initially identified Thomas' character. On August 20, 2016, it was announced that the season premiere would pit ADA Rafael Barba (Raúl Esparza) against Lt. Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) on opposing sides of the verdict.[7] The episode ""Rape Interrupted"" (which guest stars Anthony Edwards), was ripped from the headlines based on the Brock Turner sexual assault case, where Turner sexually assaulted an unconscious girl and was later convicted of three felony sexual assault charges. Turner was leniently punished as he only served three months of his six-month sentence, though he originally faced 14 years in prison based on charges. Executive producer Julie Martin told The Huffington Post, ""It is a phenomenon. Unfortunately, there have been several cases like that over the spring and the summer."" Hargitay pondered if a similar case were to happen on the show: ""Like if I was the detective on that case? It could be healing to somebody to see what should happen. [Seeing] justice,"" Hargitay continued, ""If a judge would do a different sentence. You know, that's healing for people to see the right thing, the just thing happen.""[8]

On July 29, 2016, it was announced that then-Vice President Joe Biden would appear in the September 28 episode (""Making a Rapist"") as himself to talk about the backlog of rape kits.[9][10][11] Henry Thomas also appeared alongside Kelli Williams in the episode, Thomas portraying a convicted rapist who is exonerated after DNA is freshly retested.

On September 8, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Anthony Edwards would guest star on SVU. Edwards starred on the NBC medical drama ER as Dr. Mark Greene; in season four of the medical series, Mariska Hargitay guest starred as Greene's love interest, Desk Clerk Cynthia Hooper.[12] Later, TV Guide announced that Edwards would be portraying Benson's very first partner out of the Academy, Sgt. Patrick Griffin in ""Rape Interrupted"". Griffin's son is the suspect in a rape investigation that puts Benson at odds with ADA Barba and Griffin.[13] Hollywood Reporter announced that rapper-actor Wyclef Jean was guest starring in the episode ""Broken Rhymes"" (originally titled ""Bad Rap"") as a famed music producer whose client is embroiled in an assault case. Mitchell Edwards portrayed Hype in the episode as well.[14]

On October 11, 2016, Hollywood Reporter reported that Gary Cole would guest star as a politician whose campaign goes haywire when several women go public with damaging accusations.[15] The character and the episode, titled ""Unstoppable,"" drew comparisons to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. The episode was originally scheduled to air on October 26, but was then delayed until November 16 after the election finished. The episode was pulled from the schedule a second time and is indefinitely shelved.[16]

""Unstoppable"", written by Julie Martin and Rick Eid,[42] inspired by the sexual misconduct allegations against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and starring Gary Cole, was originally scheduled to air on October 26, 2016,[43] but it was pulled from the schedule[44][45][46] and has since been shelved.[47] At the 2017 Television Critics Association winter press tour, Dick Wolf expressed his belief that the episode might air that spring.[48] NBC currently has no plans to air the episode, therefore shelving it indefinitely.[42]",mainstream
704,"WASHINGTON (AP) — An online conspiracy theory dubbed “pizzagate” ended Thursday with real-world consequences when a North Carolina man was sentenced to prison for arming himself with an assault rifle, traveling to the nation’s capital and firing his weapon inside a neighborhood pizza restaurant.

Edgar Maddison Welch’s “ill-conceived plot” last year did “actual damage to the lives of real people,” a judge said before sentencing him to four years in prison.

Judge Ketanji B. Jackson said she’d never seen a case like Welch’s, and she gave him a punishment on the upper end of guidelines, in part to send a message to others. If Welch believed an internet conspiracy theory that children were being harmed at the restaurant, he should have notified law enforcement, not attempted to take the law into his own hands, the judge said during Thursday’s hearing in U.S. District Court in Washington.

Jackson said it was “sheer luck” that no one was physically injured when Welch entered Washington’s Comet Ping Pong restaurant on Dec. 4 armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and a revolver. He was there just about a month after the election of President Donald Trump to investigate unfounded internet rumors about prominent Democrats harboring child sex slaves at the restaurant.

As diners and staff fled, leaving half-eaten pizza and cups of soda, Welch went through the restaurant. At one point, he fired his AR-15 at a locked closet, but he discovered there were no children being held in the restaurant and surrendered peacefully.

Welch’s sentence was just below the 4 ½ years prosecutors sought and above the 1 ½ years Welch’s attorney asked for.

During the hearing, the 29-year-old Welch spoke briefly to apologize, saying he realized that his words “cannot undo or change what already happened.” In a letter filed with the court, he wrote that he is “truly sorry for endangering the safety of any and all bystanders who were present that day,” but he didn’t talk about the conspiracy theory that motivated him to act, saying just that he came to Washington “with the intent of helping people I believed were in dire need of assistance.”

On Thursday, he sat quietly in an orange jail jumpsuit throughout most of the hearing as his mother, father, sister and fiancée sat in the front of the courtroom.

Welch’s attorney, Dani Jahn, said that Welch’s actions were “reckless” and “misguided,” but she said Welch, a father and former emergency medical technician, had acted with the intent of defending children.

Welch, who is from Salisbury, North Carolina, pleaded guilty in March to interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition and assault with a dangerous weapon. Though the rumors he went to investigate were unfounded, they have upended the lives of those who worked in the restaurant.

The restaurant’s owner, James Alefantis, said in court that the “viscous web of lies” about his business has been traumatic for him and his staff. He still needs security there, he said, and has suffered both emotionally and financially. In letters to the judge and in court, employees described the terror of Welch’s actions, with some saying they have depression and nightmares and need trauma counseling.

But Alefantis also said he is hopeful.

“I am hopeful that those who provoke fear, traffic in lies and perpetuate conspiracy will awake to the tangible harms that result from their actions,” he said in court. “I am hopeful that one day reason will prevail before a shot rings out again in a place of warmth and love and communal gathering.”",mainstream
411,"People over 65 and ultra conservatives shared about seven times more fake information masquerading as news on the social media site than younger adults, moderates and super liberals during the 2016 U.S. election season, the first study of its kind indicates.

The first major study to look at who is sharing links from debunked sites indicates not many people are doing it. On average, only 8.5 per cent of those studied — about 1 person out of 12 — shared false information during the 2016 campaign, according to the study released Wednesday in the journal Science Advances . But those doing it tend to be older and more conservative.

""For something to be viral you've got to know who shares it,"" said study co-author Jonathan Nagler, a politics professor and co-director of the Social Media and Political Participation Lab at New York University. ""Wow, old people are much more likely than young people to do this.""

Facebook and other social media companies were caught off guard in 2016 when Russian agents exploited their platforms to meddle with the U.S. presidential election by spreading fake news, impersonating Americans and running targeted advertisements to try to sway votes. Since then, the companies have thrown millions of dollars and thousands of people into fighting false information.

Researchers at Princeton University and NYU in 2016 interviewed 2,711 people who used Facebook. Of those, nearly half agreed to share all their postings with the professors.

The researchers used three different lists of false information sites — one compiled by BuzzFeed and two others from academic research teams — and counted how often people shared from those sites. Then to double check, they looked at 897 specific articles that had been found false by fact checkers and saw how often those were spread.

When other demographic factors and overall posting tendencies were factored in, the average person older than 65 shared seven times more false information than those between 18 and 29. Older people also shared more than twice as many fake stories as people between 45 and 64, and more than three times that of people in the 30- to 44-year-old range, said lead study author Andrew Guess, a politics professor at Princeton.

The simplest theory for why older people share more false information is a lack of ""digital literacy,"" said study co-author Joshua Tucker, also co-director of the NYU social media political lab. Senior citizens may not tell truth from lies on social networks as easily as others, the researchers said.

Matthew Baum is a Harvard public policy and communication professor who was not part of the study but praised it. He said he thinks sharing false information is ""less about beliefs in the facts of a story than about signalling one's partisan identity."" That's why efforts to correct fakery don't really change attitudes and one reason why few people share false information, he said.

When other demographics and posting practices are factored in, people who called themselves very conservative shared the most false information, a bit more than those who identify themselves as conservative. The very conservatives shared misinformation 6.8 times more often than the very liberals and 6.7 times more than moderates. People who called themselves liberals essentially shared no fake stories, Guess said.

Nagler said he was not surprised that conservatives in 2016 shared more fake information, but he and his colleagues said that does not necessarily mean conservatives are by nature more gullible when it comes to false stories. It could simply reflect that there was much more pro-Trump and anti-Clinton false information in circulation in 2016 that it drove the numbers for sharing, they said.

However, Baum said in an email that conservatives post more false information because they tend to be more extreme, with less ideological variation than their liberal counterparts, and they take their lead from Trump, who ""advocates, supports, shares and produces fake news/misinformation on a regular basis.""

The researchers looked at differences in gender, race and income but could not find any statistically significant differences in sharing of false information.

After much criticism, Facebook made changes to fight false information, including de-emphasizing proven false stories in people's feeds so others are less likely to see them. It seems to be working, Guess said. Facebook officials declined to comment.

""I think if we were to run this study again, we might not get the same results,"" Guess said.

MIT's Deb Roy, a former Twitter chief media scientist, said the problem is the American news diet is ""full of balkanized narratives"" with people seeking information that they agree with and calling true news that they don't agree with fake.",mainstream
1284,"A haunting final video has emerged of actor Isaac Kappy who live-streamed for an hour about the 'darkness' he suffered three days before he took his own life on Monday.

In the video, Kappy talk about letting darkness 'consume' him and referred to himself as a 'bad guy'.

He does not explicitly state his plan to kill himself and it is so far unclear. He is believed to have posted it online on Friday but it is not clear where it surfaced first.

After news of his suicide emerged, YouTube fans reposted it in their droves.

The video gives an insight into the 42-year-old's troubled mind at the time of his death. Known for his appearances in Thor and Terminator, Kappy was also notable because he was accused of 'choking' Paris Jackson.

In recent years, he had become obsessed with exposing pedophilia in Hollywood and in his video, he talks about letting that effort take over his life.

In the video, throughout which a dog can be heard yapping in the background, he said repeatedly: 'I let the darkness consume me.'

He refers to a 'really stupid, cynical, heavy decision' that he made recently, and said: 'I didn't spend enough time nurturing the light and love within me.

'I let down some really great people and it was my desire to serve these people but that desire was not born out of a love that is pure.'

At the end, he says: 'Guys, once I found out about pizza gate I was literally, I put thousands of hours into this, thousands of hours, but what happened? I became so focused with the externalizations of evil that i did not find the evil within and focus on the light.

'Maybe I'll be back later. I love you. Take care, OK.'

He went on to say he had done a 'disservice' to God and to 'a lot of people' and he called himself a 'traitor'.

Officials confirmed on Tuesday that Kappy, 42, was struck by a Ford pickup truck after hurling himself from the Transwestern Road bridge onto Interstate 40, where he died, according a statement from Bart Graves, a spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Public Safety.

In the 24 hours leading up to his death, Kappy posted a long statement on Instagram where he wrote, 'I have not been a good guy,' and 'I have been abusive to people who loved me.'

The self-admitted drug user made headlines in 2018 for allegedly assaulting Michael Jackson's daughter, Paris, by choking her 'during a game night party.'

The native Angeleno has also publicly accused Seth Green of being a pedophile.

Arizona state troopers were called to the scene at 7.26am Mountain on Monday, and Kappy was found deceased upon their arrival, Graves' statement said.

Before the Beerfest actor died, 'several bystanders tried physically restraining Kappy from jumping but failed to hold him,' TMZ reported.

No one else was reported injured in the incident, and the investigation has officially been closed.

Kappy's Instagram post on Sunday was captioned, 'Beware the man has nothing to lose, for he has nothing to protect.'

In the message posted as a screenshot of text he wrote, 'Over the course of the last week, through introspection that should have happened MANY years ago, I have come to some stark revelations about my character. It is a testament to my utter ignorance that these revelations had not come sooner.

'You see, I believed myself to be a good guy. I HAVE NOT been a good guy. In fact, I have been a pretty bad guy throughout my life.'

Kappy penned a scathing assessment of his own character, writing, I have used people for money. I have betrayed MANY people and much trust.

'I have sold drugs. I have tax delinquencies. I have debts. I have abused my body with cigarettes, drugs and alcohol.'

Throughout the message, Kappy mentioned 'the Q movement' and said 'I am so so sorry to have brought shame upon the greatest military operation of all time.

Kappy referenced suicide in a metaphor, as well, writing, 'Q says they give people enough rope to hang themselves, and I have hung myself.'

He also claimed to have 'betrayed' Donald Trump and Jesus Christ in the missive, referencing death again.

'I have told people in the Trump administration that I am willing to admit to my many crimes in a public setting, and committed to execution, in a public setting,' Kappy wrote. 'A nation cannot suffer its traitors, and I am no exception.'

Kappy was reportedly being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department for threatening Paris Jackson , and other celebrities.

According to TMZ, Kappy allegedly choked Paris during a game night party.

This might have been referenced in his farewell message, as well, where he wrote, 'I have been abusive to people WHO LOVED ME, including my FAMILY.

'To the many people I have acted abusively towards, I am very, very sorry. To my former friends I have used and betrayed, I am sorry.'

The 21-year-old model had allegedly received 'rambling and scary' texts from her former pal. Sources claim she initially responded to them to help him because she though he was suicidal at that time, as well.

She was later forced to move home and hire extra bodyguards, along with blocking Kappy's number.

Police opened an investigation into the actor after seeing a particularly menacing tweet from Kappy on August 1 that read: 'In light of the interesting traffic happening around my house I want to make something CRYSTAL CLEAR: While I am a VERY strong advocate of peaceful disclosure, make no mistake, assets are in place and if you kill me or even try, it will rain .50 cals in the Hollywood Hills.'

Per his Twitter account, Kappy appeared to be on a crusade to take down people he believes are sexually abusing children.

He wrote in his post on Sunday, 'While it's true I have spent many, many hours of research and disseminating information about bad actors, I have had SO LITTLE CARE for introspection about MY OWN actions.

'And while it's true I have outed many pedophiles that were former FRIENDS, I remained in their sphere for much longer than I should have, and attempted to gain from them AFTER I knew about their actions. And in my SHEER ARROGANCE I did not even reflect on this fact.'

His timeline is full of retweeted news stories about pedophiles and rants about high-profile people accused of sex crimes and some who aren't. He accused Green of being a pedophile in a video posted in July.

Kappy had also, according to his Twitter, tried to reach out to Corey Feldman to take on pedophilia together. Corey blocked him on Twitter and did not respond.

He previously called out the cast of Guardians of the Galaxy for defending ousted director James Gunn and Bill Clinton.

Kappy added, 'It should be noted that I have recently been made to believe that I am the reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, the great betrayer. And while I could have utilized this period of great awakening to AWAKEN myself, I have used it focused on the darkness OF OTHERS and not the darkness WITHIN.'

Kappy ended his final message writing, 'See the light in others. Nurture the light in yourself. This lesson has come too late for me, but perhaps it can inspire you. I will be using the remainder of my time on earth to atone for my transgressions, and to seek the light within, in others and myself.'

The letter was mysteriously dated at the bottom, 'July 4th, 2019' and signed off with 'Return of the King Return to THE LIGHT.'

1054,"Picture this: You’re the elusive chanteuse Mariah Carey and it’s New Year’s Eve.

You’re prepared to redeem yourself from last year’s sad performance by singing yet again in front of a live crowd and a televised audience, but this time you want some hot tea. However, there is none. It’s a total disaster. What do you do?

This was the real-life situation faced by Carey as she performed on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest. “Happy New Year!” she called to the crowd. “I just want to take a sip of tea, if they will let me,” she said before realizing that there was none.

“They told me there would be tea! Oh, it’s a disaster!” she lamented, faltering only for a moment before remembering that the show had to go on. “Okay, well, we’ll just have to rough it,” she conceded. “I’m going to be like everybody else, with no hot tea.”

Admittedly, it was freezing in Manhattan on New Year’s Eve, and cold, dry air is not the ideal environment to sing in. A warm beverage would have probably soothed Mariah’s throat after reaching those sky-high notes that she is known for, but nevertheless, she was able to give a great performance even though she had to suffer through it like a plebe without her tea.

The iconic “I don’t know her” diva even shared a photo to Twitter at 11:38 p.m. with a mug of tea captioned, “Found my tea!” We’re shocked the Queen of Shade didn’t include the side-eye emoji.

One of the 25 smartest New Year’s resolutions you can make is to ditch coffee for tea. Just think: If it’s good enough for Mariah (who only accepts the best), then it’s good enough for you.",mainstream

If we ever needed something to convince us that the #pizzagate conspiracy may have had an element of truth, this is surely it – never before have we seen such a quick and clean removal of a Journalists work and social media accounts.

Don’t believe for a second this is all some bizarre coincidence, this is a ‘Clean up operation’ also known as ‘Damage Control’.

Still no word from Swann. and when it comes, we expect it to be the contrived words of another – most likely he will now be working for the so-to-speak.

The alternative is that we never hear from Swann again and the winds of time blow away any evidence that his work ever existed.

1048,"Donald Trump woke up on Saturday and posted another disparaging remark about Morning Joe cohost Mika Brzezinski on Twitter — while also writing that Brzezinski and her cohost and fiancé, Joe Scarborough, are “not bad people”

Donald Trump woke up on Saturday and posted another disparaging remark about Morning Joe cohost Mika Brzezinski on Twitter — while also writing that Brzezinski and her cohost and fiancé, Joe Scarborough, are “not bad people.”

“Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people, but their low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses. Too bad!” the President of the United States wrote on his verified Twitter account.

Trump became embroiled in a self-made controversy on Thursday after he attacked Brzezinski and Scarborough via Twitter. “How come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year’s Eve, and insisted on joining me,” Trump wrote. “She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!”

On Friday, Brzezinski and Scarborough responded to Trump with both an op-ed in the Washington Post and on-air segment during MSNBC’s Morning Joe.

“President Trump launched personal attacks against us Thursday, but our concerns about his unmoored behavior go far beyond the personal. America’s leaders and allies are asking themselves yet again whether this man is fit to be president. We have our doubts, but we are both certain that the man is not mentally equipped to continue watching our show, Morning Joe,” the pair wrote. They also blasted Trump for his frequent attacks against women, including Megyn Kelly, former Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, Rosie O’Donnell, and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

“Putting aside Mr. Trump’s never-ending obsession with women’s blood, Mika and her face were perfectly intact, as pictures from that night reveal,” they wrote. “And though it is no one’s business, the president’s petulant personal attack against yet another woman’s looks compels us to report that Mika has never had a face-lift. If she had, it would be evident to anyone watching Morning Joe on their high-definition TV. She did have a little skin under her chin tweaked, but this was hardly a state secret. Her mother suggested she do so, and all those around her were aware of this mundane fact.”

On MSNBC, Scarborough noted that Trump “for some reason, takes things so much more personally with women. He’s so much more vicious with women.”

In a separate interview, Scarborough claimed Trump was impressed by Brzezinski’s cosmetic surgery when the three met on New Year’s Eve at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.

“The irony of it all is that Donald kept saying, ‘That’s incredible. You can’t even tell? Who did it? Who did it?’” Scarborough told Vanity Fair, recalling a conversation he purportedly had with Trump. “He kept asking for the name of the doctor. He literally asked 10 times. ‘Is he down here? Who is he?’” (The White House did not comment on Scarborough’s claim.)

In addition to his tweet about Brzezinski and Scarborough on Saturday, Trump also claimed Greta Van Susteren was ousted at MSNBC by “out of control bosses at [NBC] and [Comcast]” because she “refused to go along w/ ‘Trump hate!’”

1039,"MANCHESTER UNITED face Arsenal for the first time this season.

For years, this was Premier League’s most enthralling fixture, which produced some of the biggest talking points of the campaign.

Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger renew their rivalry at the Emirates, but it's still a far cry from the late 1990s and early 2000s crackers.

There is nothing this clash has not seen. There has been everything between the pair — with both sides even clinching a title against the other at Old Trafford.

What made this clash special was, not just how much was riding on it, but how personal it became between the pressure.

Through great difficulty, we’ve managed to whittle down a catalogue of classic matches to the best seven.

This was Wenger's first home match against United — and he soon realised what this fixture was all about.

Goals from Andrew Cole and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer put the away side in cruise control before Dennis Bergkamp netted a consolation.

But the main talking point came late on. Ian Wright, who had exchanged words with Peter Schmeichel in the earlier fixture at Old Trafford that season, was put through on goal — only to be flagged offside.

However, he carried on regardless and came down with a two-footed stamp on the great Dane.

Sir Alex Ferguson was incensed and demanded a red card but Wright finished the game. At the full-time whistle, he had to be restrained as he attempted to confront Schmeichel.

A rivalry was well and truly born.

United were fighting to become the first English side to win a Treble of league, FA Cup and Champions League — while the Gunners were defending the former two.

The pair were level in the Premier League and had drawn 0-0 at Villa Park in the original game.

David Beckham opened the scoring with a superb curling effort past David Seaman, before Bergkamp equalised.

Arsenal appeared to be in the ascendancy as Nicolas Anelka's goal was ruled offside and Roy Keane saw red late on.

Bergkamp was then given the chance to send Arsenal to Wembley when Phil Neville recklessly brought down Ray Parlour in the box in stoppage time — only to see his spot-kick saved by Schmeichel.

A thrilling contest took another twist when Patrick Vieira gave the ball to Ryan Giggs in the middle of the park.

The Welshman just kept on running, past Lee Dixon, past Martin Keown, before firing high into the roof of the net to finish off one of the most memorable goals in English football history.

There was still time for Tony Adams to head wide with the final act of the game as United prevailed in an absolute classic.

Arsenal had finished as runners up to United for three consecutive seasons after winning a maiden Premier League title.

But they came back with a vengeance.

Arguably Wenger's best team, packed with power, speed, leadership and skilled steamrolled over their openings — finishing the season unbeaten away from home.

The Gunners also set another record that season by netting in every single game.

And Arsenal wrapped up the title at the home of the fierce rivals.

Sylvain Wiltord capitalised on a Fabien Barthez mistake to score the game's only goal on 55 minutes.

The strike clinched Arsenal's second Double in four years.

Ahead of this match, there was much interest as to how Ashley Cole would cope with 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo after dealing comfortably against Beckham in recent encounters.

But there was also a subtle rivalry developing between Arsenal as a club — and more specifically, Vieira — and United's Ruud van Nistelrooy.

The Dutchman had been the scorn of the Gunners in the previous campaign as Fergie's men pipped Wenger to the title.

With the game deadlocked and 80 minutes on the clock, Vieira and Van Nistelrooy challenge for a ball which ends with the Frenchman on the floor.

In frustration, he kicks out at the Dutchman to receive second booking. A brawl ensues which remarkably sees Keane act as peacemaker.

The drama wasn't over as United were awarded a stoppage time penalty following Keown's foul on Diego Forlan.

Van Nistelrooy eventually stepped up and crashed his effort against the bar.

Keown led the Arsenal players in deriding the devastated Dutchman.

After the final whistle, they crowded around him and players from both sides got involved in ugly scenes.

Arsenal were fined £175,000 and Lauren, Keown, Vieira and Ray Parlour were handed bans, while Ronaldo and Giggs were also ordered to pay.

The draw at Old Trafford was game No 8 into what would become the longest undefeated streak in English football history.

Arsenal went the entire 2003-04 season without losing a match and The Invincibles arrived at Old Trafford trying to extend their unbeaten streak to 50.

Gary and Phil Neville hit Robert Pires with some ferocious tackles in a fiery first-half which yielded no goals.

But, with 17 minutes remaining, the game burst into life.

Wayne Rooney — on his 19th birthday — went down under minimal contact when Sol Campbell naively hung a leg out in the box.

After what seemed like an eternity, Van Nistelrooy coolly rolled the ball into the bottom corner to cue wild and — as Wenger would later claim — over the top, jubilant scenes.

The Gunners pressed for an equaliser but were suckerpunched in the final minute as the birthday boy wrapped up the points.

A triumphant Fergie waved to the crowd as he left the Old Trafford pitch in his suit — only to appear for the post-match interview in a tracksuit.

It was later alleged he had been hit by pizza thrown at him by an Arsenal midfielder, Cesc Fabregas.

This game came to life even before the players had made it to the pitch.

Keane came storming down the tunnel to confront Vieira for alleged comments made towards Gary Neville.

Referee Graham Poll enjoyed being the centre of attention as he calmed the warring pair down.

Players refused to shake hands and the tone was set.

Tackles flew in with fans baying for red cards at every turn.

Vieira put the Gunners ahead before Giggs equalised and Bergkamp restored the home side's advantage.

The game turned on it's head as Ronaldo netted a quick-fire double but United saw Mikael Silvestre sent off for a vicious headbutt on Freddie Ljungberg.

The rivalry was diminishing — but they still managed to eek out on classic.

This was never the greatest game, but the Gunners still made history.

Thierry Henry won it for Arsenal with the last kick of the game — and it was the only time Fergie ever conceded a last minute winner.

Rooney had given United the lead before Robin van Perise rifled an equaliser into the roof of the net.",mainstream
1035,"The FBI publication of January 31, 2007, (U) Symbols and Logos Used by Pedophiles to Identify Sexual Preferences, states:

“Pedophiles…are using various types of identification logos or symbols to recognize one another and distinguish their sexual preferences…. These symbols have been etched into rings and formed into pendants, and have also been found imprinted on coins.”

Below are the symbols for “boy lover”, “girl lover” and “child lover” pedophiles, according to the FBI:

 

 

 

 The FBI’s Symbols and Logos Used by Pedophiles furthermore states:

“Pedophilia symbols on jewelry, coins, Web sites and other effects are indicative of advertisement methods used by child sexual predators to promote their cause. Pedophile activists advocate for the social acceptance of sexual relationships between adults and children. These organizations seek to decriminalize sexual relationships between adults and children and to legalize child pornography based on their belief that children have the ability to consent to sexual acts…. Investigators should also be attentive to pedophilia symbols advertised on Web sites.“



The ABC late night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! has a recurrent skit of Kimmel’s “Cousin Sal” pranking people.

 On May 14, 2015, the skit was “Cousin Sal’s Home Deliveries — Pizza”. As you watch it, keep in mind the pedophile symbols and the FBI’s warning about those symbols on websites being “indicative of advertisement methods used by child sex predators to promote their cause”.

 

 In the event YouTube takes down the video, I took a screenshot from the video showing three decorative hooks on a wall outside Cousin Sal’s front door, two of which are the pedophile symbols for boy lover.

 

 To the innocent, the wall hooks are just wiggly decorative wall hooks.

 But not to pedophiles. They know that in the “Cousin Sal” skit, Jimmy Kimmel was signaling to “boy lover” pedophiles. That the home deliveries were for pizzas — the pedophile code word for little girls — is another Kimmel nod-and-wink to fellow pedophiles.

Even when it comes to pizza.

Woods was playing the pro-am at the Farmers Insurance Open when he stopped over for pizza that was being served by 13th tee. One problem: It wasn't ready for distribution because of a routine health inspection.

""They weren't allowed to give them out,"" Woods said Friday when told the video of his pizza rejection was making the rounds. ""They were filling out paperwork at the time. We were the first ones through, so I don't know.""

The moment was caught on video by Brandon Stone of KUSI. It shows Woods walking up to a table of pizza boxes by Dang Brother Pizza, and a sheepish server having to tell the 80-time PGA Tour winner that he couldn't serve him.

Woods had a laugh about it Friday after his second straight 2-under 70 left him 11 shots out of the lead.

""We were looking for anything. We were starving,"" Woods said. ""A couple guys in the group were offering 20 bucks for a box of pizza, and we didn't get any. So that's the way it goes.""

Theresa, a young British girl, recalled for ’60 Minutes’ the drama that she was forced to endure as a child.

According to her, she was raped countless times by dozens of rich and powerful men that were part of a Satanic pedophilia cult.

She was also forced to have sex with animals and even witnessed human sacrifices — especially newborn and aborted babies, which were then chopped to pieces and eaten by the participants.

The sacrifices, she said, were dedicated to Lucifer.

According to Ray Wyre, a psychiatrist specialized in dealing with both victims and perpetrators of Satanic abuse, her accounts matched in great detail the multitude of other accounts that he heard before (he had 21 cases in the past two years leading to the interview alone), including the practice of placing children in wooden boxes together with spiders and snakes and locking them up.

389,"Paul Joseph Watson (born 24 May 1982)[1] is an English YouTube personality, radio host, writer and conspiracy theorist.[3][4][5][6] He has been described as ""alt-right"" and ""far-right"" by multiple sources.[6][7][8][9][10][11] Although as late as July 2016 he called himself alt-right, he no longer accepts that label and considers himself part of the New Right.[12]

Watson's career emerged through his work for conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones. As editor-at-large of Jones' website InfoWars he helped promote fake news[13] and advocated conspiracy theories such as the claim 9/11 was a government cover-up, the chemtrail conspiracy theory, and the New World Order.[1] Subsequently, reaching a significant audience, both Watson and Jones altered their focus. Presently their commentary is mainly focused on criticizing feminism, Islam, and left-wing politics.[14] Watson also contributes to InfoWars's talk radio program The Alex Jones Show, where he occasionally either hosts or co-hosts. Watson has been working on InfoWars since October 2002.[15]

Since 2011, Watson has hosted his own YouTube channel, prisonplanetlive, from which he expresses his views on topics such as contemporary society, politics, and modern liberalism in an often mocking manner. He describes his channel as ""Culture, controversy, contrarianism"" and often lampoons celebrities and politicians. As of January 2020, his channel has over 1.78 million subscribers.[16]

In May 2019, Facebook barred Watson and other users considered ""extremist"" from using its Facebook and Instagram services.[17][18]

Watson described his formative moment as when, at the age of 18, he watched The Secret Rulers of the World, a documentary in which journalist Jon Ronson accompanied Alex Jones in infiltrating Bohemian Grove in California, a location where some conspiracy theorists believe that global elites plot the New World Order. He has described British conspiracy theorist David Icke, who he first read as a teenager, as the person who woke him up.[1]

Watson, along with Jones and InfoWars as a whole, has shifted from mainly commenting on conspiracy theories such as chemtrails, the New World Order and the Illuminati, to increasingly commenting against feminism, Islam, and left-wing politics.[14] Watson has been described as a member of ""the new far-right"" by The New York Times, which wrote in August 2017 that his ""videos are straightforward nativist polemics, with a particular focus on Europe"" and also noted his opposition to modernist architecture and modern art.[19] Iman Abou Atta, the director of the anti-Islamophobia group Tell MAMA, has said that ""Paul Joseph Watson has become 'the' nexus for anti-Muslim accounts that we have mapped... He has become an influencer in promoting information—much of it bizarre and untrue—which has been regurgitated by anti-Muslim and anti-migrant accounts time and time again.""[20]

Watson previously described himself as a ""libertarian"" and supported Ron Paul in the 2012 presidential election. In a 2016 tweet, he said he no longer considered himself a ""libertarian"" because Gary Johnson ""made the term an embarrassment.""[21] Watson has also referred to himself as a ""conservative"" and he considers modern-day conservatism to be a countercultural movement.[13] In a post on Facebook in November 2016, Watson differentiated between being a member of the New Right, which he considers to be distinct from the alt-right. He claimed that the alt-right ""likes to fester in dark corners of subreddits and obsess about Jews, racial superiority and Adolf Hitler.""[12] He and Mike Cernovich have feuded with figures such as Richard B. Spencer and David Duke who see white nationalism as necessary for the alt-right.[citation needed]

Although he endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, Watson declared in a tweet on 6 April 2017 he was ""officially OFF the Trump train"" following the president's decision to launch missile strikes on Syria in response to a gas attack several days earlier, believing Trump had reneged on his promise to not intervene in Syria. He said the president was ""just another deep state/Neo-con puppet"".[22] After a decrease in Twitter followers occurred, he denied he had ""turned on Trump,"" saying he was only ""off the Trump train in terms of Syria"" and blamed the media for ""fake news"".[23] He declared in a separate tweet he would shift his focus on ensuring French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen of the National Front would be elected in the 2017 election, in which she was ultimately defeated.[24] Donald Trump Jr. retweeted Watson's reference to French celebrities leaving France if Le Pen was elected and referred dismissively to similar reputed claims in the US before Trump Sr. was elected.[2]

On 16 June 2018, Watson announced that he had joined the UK Independence Party along with Mark Meechan and Carl Benjamin.[25][26][27]

In July 2018, Watson signed ""The Non-Feminist Declaration"",[28] which includes the phrase ""Given the extent of feminist entrenchment in institutions, we recognize that we are embarking on a project that may last for decades, but we shall not waver in our determination to roll back feminist influence over state and other institutions.""[29]

In 2016, he was an early proponent of the health allegations that Hillary Clinton suffers from numerous serious medical conditions, although he had no evidence.[30] Watson's part in the manufacture and dissemination of the rumour was taken up by the National Enquirer[30] and mentioned in the mainstream media as part of a discussion of the role of rumour and conspiracy theory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[31][3][32]

In February 2017, he tweeted an offer to pay for a journalist to visit Sweden and stay in the ""crime ridden migrant suburbs"" of Malmö, if they think it would be safe.[33] Many journalists took him up on the offer,[33][34] and Watson chose New York journalist and videographer Tim Pool, who was already planning a similar investigation.[35] Watson provided US$2,000 to Pool for the trip.[33][35] Tim Pool also ran a fundraiser to fund an investigation into other 'no-go zones' in other areas of Sweden and Europe.[35]

At a White House press briefing in November 2018, persistent questioning of President Trump led to an intern attempting to take a microphone from the hand of CNN's Jim Acosta.[36][37] Acosta's White House press credentials were subsequently revoked, allegedly for having ""put his hands"" on the intern.[38][39]

Watson uploaded an edited version of the original footage in support of this claim. In this version, zoom and frame rate changes create the misleading impression that Acosta had behaved aggressively towards the intern.[38] Watson confirmed that he had applied a zoom and denied making any other alterations, though expert analysis confirmed that ""the clip repeats several frames that do not appear in the original footage"" and that it had been speeded up.[40][39] The video has generally been described as 'doctored', though some experts concluded that the changes do not necessarily represent deliberate manipulation but could be the result of artefacts resulting from accidental degradation during processing.[40][41] White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders pointed to the video that Watson posted as clearly documenting Acosta's ""inappropriate behaviour."" The White House was criticised for sharing a doctored video and thereby spreading ""actual fake news"" rather than using the original footage.[42] A subsequent court ruling found that the action against Acosta was unconstitutional on due process grounds.[43]

On May 2, 2019, Watson and several other people considered to be extremists, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as well as Jones and right-wing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, were permanently banned from Facebook, which called them ""dangerous.""[44] ""We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,"" a Facebook spokesperson said. ""The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.""[45] Watson insisted on Twitter that he had broken ""none of their rules"" and complained of ""an authoritarian society controlled by a handful of Silicon Valley giants"" in which ""all dissent must be purged.""[17] President Trump retweeted Watson mocking the ""dangerous"" epithet.[46]

Watson is anti-immigration.[47][1] He has claimed[48] that ""Malmö is known as ‘Sweden’s Chicago’"" due to mass immigration into Nordic countries.[49] According to Salon magazine, the claim is false,[50] an assessment which is supported by a study published in Critical Studies in Media Communication.[51]

Watson is anti-Islam.[47][52][53] He has labelled Muslim culture as ""horrific"" and declared that it produces mass rape, ""Islamic ghettos"" and the destruction of Western culture.[1] Watson has said that the western world needs ""Islam control"" rather than gun control. Watson wrote in an InfoWars article that ""Muslims living in both the Middle East and the west show alarmingly high levels of support for violent jihad.""[54] He stated that there is ""violent oppression of gays and Christians in the Middle East"".[55] In August 2017, he claimed that YouTube had blocked monetisation on all his videos about Islam, as part of the website's policies dealing with hate speech, and on other subjects including modern art.[56]

Watson has criticised perceived racial tokenism, leading to criticism.[57] In 2017, he attacked the BBC for ""portraying Roman Britain as ethnically diverse"", after the broadcaster included a black Roman centurion in an educational cartoon. His assertions were contradicted by Mary Beard and Cambridge's Faculty of Classics, citing ""overwhelming"" evidence that Roman Britain was a ""multi ethnic society,"" but noting that this would have been more noticeable in a military or urban setting than a rural one and the ""significant gaps"" in historians' understanding of the topic.[58]",mainstream

1290,"Frontline executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath was in her office late last summer when special projects editor Philip Bennett walked in. He’d just been watching the raw footage from Frontline’s upcoming documentary, “Putin’s Revenge,” a two-part program about Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 election. The interviews were amazing, he said. What if they put them online?

All of them.

“We’d been talking for a long time about what we could do at Frontline to really put a stake in the ground, that we are committed to transparency,” Aronson-Rath says. “A lightbulb went on, that this is the one we should go big on.”

The production team swung into action. At the same time editors and interns were working to produce the program to air that fall, behind the scenes they were also preparing 70 hours’ worth of interviews to post on the web. They fact-checked each, and vetted them with lawyers with the same care they did for the documentary itself.

Frontline’s Transparency Project is one of a number of new attempts by media to open up the process they use to create their journalism to engender more trust with audiences

But Aronson-Rath and her team didn’t want to just dump 56 interviews for audiences to sift through on their own. They used open-source software Bennett had helped create to make the films searchable by text, so viewers could easily find footage on specific subjects. They could even splice out a section and share it on social media. The result is both an exhaustive look at the issue of Russian hacking and an unparalleled look behind-the-scenes at the reporting process. In four months, the videos had more than 300,000 views, with 40 percent of web traffic referred by social media. What’s more, visitors spent twice as long with the interviews—an average of 28 minutes, much longer even than Aronson-Rath and Bennett anticipated—as the average visitor to the Frontline site. “Things that I myself wouldn’t have considered as part of the story now have relevance. It gives me a moment for pause. I am now watching from an expanded viewpoint and it’s interesting to see what is corroborated through other sources and what is not,” one viewer commented.

The Transparency Project, as Frontline is calling the effort, is one of a number of new attempts by media to open up the process they use to create their journalism to engender more trust with audiences. In a January Gallup/Knight Foundation poll of more than 19,000 Americans, respondents ranked their trust of media at only 37 out of 100. Just 50 percent of respondents said they had enough information to sort out facts in the face of media bias, down from 66 percent in 1984. Among Republicans, that number was even lower, only 31 percent.

Frontline has long been putting the complete transcripts of its interviews online—but putting the searchable videos online is a dramatic expansion of that proposition, laying bare the process of making documentaries, warts and all. “You see the real deal, people swiping their face, laughing, looking nervous,” Aronson-Rath says.

In many ways, the new push for transparency is a response to the current media environment of “fake news”—both the dissemination of actual false stories online and through social media, and the cries from the current administration that stories it doesn’t like are “fake.” As more and more Americans get their news through social media, content gets divorced from context that allows readers to decide whether a story is trustworthy.

“People are getting their news through every possible medium and on every possible device,” says Melody Kramer, senior audience development manager at the Wikimedia Foundation and columnist for the Poynter Institute. “It’s a challenge to figure out the veracity of the information, where it came from, what the point of view is, or how it was put together.” That creates more of an imperative for news organizations to pull back the curtain to explain to readers how they report and write stories. “It becomes incumbent upon organizations—that are trying to improve our lower-d democracy—to open up a window into how they do the work they do.”

At the same time, transparency can serve a defensive function, insulating the media from attacks of political bias or unfairness. As far back as 2009, Harvard technologist David Weinberger declared that “transparency is the new objectivity,” making a writer more credible in the eyes of readers not through adherence to a supposed standard of impartiality, but by making clear the “sources and values that brought her to that position.”

Among those organizations leading the current charge to increase transparency is the American Press Institute (API), which in 2014 produced a report entitled “Build Credibility Through Transparency.” The report advocated for publications to “show their work” by being clearer about their sources and correcting mistakes. In the run-up to the 2016 election, API consulted with news organizations about how to better disclose sources, using PolitiFact as a model. But it was unprepared for the level of hostility toward media and the allegations of bias and “fake news.”

“That’s when we started seeing a problem with misinformation, of which ‘fake news’ is part of that universe,” says Jane Elizabeth, accountability program director, who was surprised by the lack of media literacy among audiences and their willingness to believe outlandish stories with little sourcing, such as the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory. “Readers were confused and unable to tell the difference between misinformation, disinformation, and ‘fake news,’” Elizabeth says.

She places most of the blame on the current administration for deliberately sowing that confusion. “Trump’s candidacy had everything to do with this,” she says. “It was the type of campaign we had never dealt with before.” At the same time, she faults the media for not opening its doors to show the level of editorial care and vetting that goes into the news. “People think anyone can write something and press a button and it appears online.”

The first step toward transparency, she says, is to listen to readers about what they don’t know—and what they want to know—about how news is gathered, verified, and reported. “Otherwise, you are just divulging the wrong things.” Some things that might seem obvious to journalists, such as the ethics of using an anonymous source, may be opaque to readers and sow confusion and distrust.

API is not the only organization working with publications to improve transparency. Transparency advocate Josh Stearns of the Democracy Fund has spent the last two years working with newsrooms across New Jersey on how to better engage with readers and open up their reporting to scrutiny. While such initiatives can be time- and resource-intensive, he says, they can also help bolster revenue by explaining the value of rigorous reporting.

“Helping people understand the labor that goes into reporting, is a powerful way to build a relationship with the reader that will cause them to want to support it,” Stearns says. Such support can go beyond merely financial. “If we want the public to stand up for our rights for FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] requests, or when local mayors want to block us, then we want to have the public’s back and we want them to have ours.”

Other active transparency initiatives include the Trusting News project run by Joy Mayer and supported by the Reynolds Journalism Institute at the University of Missouri, which has surveyed thousands of journalists and readers and is working with 14 newsrooms on experiments to engage more authentically with readers; and the newly launched News Co/Lab, funded mainly by the Facebook Journalism Project and run by veteran journalist Dan Gillmor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, which is partnering with the McClatchy newspaper group.

One of the most ambitious efforts to improve media transparency is the Trust Project, an initiative of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. Led by journalist Sally Lehrman, the project worked with newsroom leaders from 75 publications to develop a common set of standards for transparency it calls “trust indicators.” In November, about 10 publications began rolling out the indicators worldwide, including The Economist, Mic, and The Washington Post. Significantly, the project has gotten social media sites and search engines including Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Bing on board as partners; the sites have agreed to start using the indicators in their feeds to give users a measure of the trustworthiness of articles.

In many ways, the new push for transparency is a response to the current media environment of “fake news”

“In the case where the work is divorced from the brand, you can see some of the markers that might help you know this piece of journalism and the quality behind it,” says Lehrman. Unlike, say, a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, which would rely on an outside entity to certify a brand as trustworthy, the project presents a set of guidelines to publications they can adapt as they see fit, under eight headings, including standards and practices; author expertise; citations and references; and diverse voices. (Partners are free to use the TrustMark, a T logo designed by the project, or not.)

Under standards and practices, for example, the project requires that organizations clearly post their mission statement and ethics and corrections policy, both on a site level and with each individual piece. “These are often straightforward to journalists, but at the same time they are not often spelled out,” says Lehrman. “A lot of people don’t realize they exist.” Even in cases where sites include such policies, they are often hidden, buried on a second or third page on their website.

In addition to providing greater information about the publication, Lehrman and other transparency advocates are also pushing to include more about story authors, including their local or demographic background, years of experience in covering subject matter, awards they have won, and languages spoken—which is especially important for those covering minority or refugee communities.

Publications may also consider including a statement with stories they publish, particularly for stories that might be controversial or political in nature and open themselves to criticism. “It really forces the reporter to think about, why did I do this story, why was it important?” says Elizabeth. For example, a story written in a newspaper in a farming state about the use of toxic fertilizers could open journalists up to allegations of bias against the farming industry. “You really need to explain why you are stepping into this volatile subject,” says Elizabeth. “We are doing this story because our state has the highest percentage of dangerous nutrients in the water. Just so people don’t think, ‘look, that liberal democrat is trying to ruin our economy,’ just to show it’s a serious topic worth consideration.”

Just as important is that publications come clean when they make errors. Publishing on the web, it can be tempting to make changes on the sly, hoping that readers won’t notice. But that’s bad practice, say transparency advocates. Not only do readers notice when a story changes—which may increase skepticism over time—but also consistently seeing corrections on other stories might increase their perception that stories without corrections are accurate.

As News Co/Lab’s Dan Gillmor says, over time that may cause the public to believe a publication less, but trust it more. “The more you explain what you screwed up on, the more people are going to realize that journalism has its flaws, so the belief that any given story is 100 percent correct will drop,” says Gillmor, who is working with The Kansas City Star to develop a model corrections policy. “But I would hope that the trust in journalists to work really hard to make sure you know about the mistakes and correct them would improve.”

Transparency advocates recommend making corrections at the same level as the original mistake—if the error was on the front page, then the correction should be, too. For stories online, corrections should be clearly noted at the beginning or end of the article. Some publications are experimenting with putting corrections inline, either through crossing out and inserting text or noting corrections in the margin with a link to the corrections note.

Furthermore, a growing consensus among advocates is that the old adage that you don’t repeat a mistake in making the correction is no longer true. Because users may not be reading the publication daily or have seen the original story, it raises more questions than it answers to leave readers in the dark about the original error. Rather, the correction should clearly state the original error, as well as the correct information.

The first step toward transparency is to listen to readers about what they don’t know—and what they want to know—about how news is gathered, verified, and reported

The big question right now is whether such transparency will lead to an increase in trust. Research by Michael Koliska, a Georgetown University communications professor, suggests that there are no easy solutions when it comes to creating more trust. For his Ph.D. dissertation, published in 2015, Koliska set up several experiments in which he gave six versions of an article with varying degrees of information, from one that didn’t even have a byline to one with a byline, author bio, and information about the sources and production process.

The additional information, however, had no effect on whether readers found the story more trustworthy. In fact, says Koliska, readers barely seemed to register it. When he included a picture of the journalist on the page, and then showed a lineup of pictures afterwards, participants only picked out the right one about a third of the time. “There are a lot of these kinds of things that people just didn’t care about,” he says. “The transparency information was too peripheral to the story.”

In another paper published in 2016 in the Journal of Media Ethics, Koliska and his colleague Kalyani Chadha argue that rather than “digitally outsourcing” transparency information by adding transparency features to web pages or publishing separate stories about the process behind the article, journalists should work the information into the story, giving more background on the process and extent of the reporting and sources consulted as part of the story itself rather than relying on hyperlinks or author bios.

That doesn’t mean that providing transparency indicators isn’t worthwhile, says Koliska. As awareness of “fake news” and disinformation grows, it may cause people to seek out more information about transparency. “They will realize that they are not getting the high-quality product they want—they are getting McDonald’s sold as a Whole Foods meal, and crave something better,” he says.

Research by the Trust Project shows that may already be happening. Working with the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin, the Trust Project funded a study in which some 1,200 participants read online articles on different topics; some included the trust indicators, such as author bios, links, a “Behind the Story” companion article, and an indicator of whether the publication belonged to the Trust Project.

A small majority felt that such indicators would increase their trust of the publication, with the most (63 percent) citing the Trust Project logo, followed by a “Behind the Story” section (59 percent) and a list of corrections and ethics policies (53 percent). In addition, by a small but statistically significant margin, readers were more likely to use adjectives like “reputable,” “reliable,” and “can be trusted” for articles with indicators. “As newsrooms grapple with ways to win over doubting audiences, we find the study results encouraging,” the authors of the study noted. “The results … demonstrate that Trust Indicators can affect what people think about the news.”

As much as the online environment has eroded trust and created the need for more transparency, it also offers unique tools to increase transparency. As Frontline’s Putin documentary shows, nowhere is that the case more than in allowing journalists to “show their work” by providing access to the original source material so readers can make up their own minds about how it was used.

The Trust Project has advocated for a separate “citations and references” box that lists the key sources an article relies on; some partners such as Mic and The Economist are already using those boxes. When the project did a focus group to gauge their effectiveness, they found they increased perceptions of credibility even if readers didn’t click through to the underlying sources. Just letting the reader know that a journalist conducted additional research, even if it wasn’t included in the piece can increase reader confidence. “What if at the end of the story you listed the number of sources you reached out to, even though 20 of them were on background,” Stearns proposes.

Some publications are taking sourcing to the next level by including not only interviews, but underlying documents and source material to bolster claims in a story. ProPublica has long been a leader in this endeavor, using Document Cloud to upload and annotate documents for readers to peruse. “It has always been core to how we do our journalism,” says editor in chief Steve Engelberg. “In an era of complaints about fake news the best answer we can have in the fact-based universe is to provide the reader with as much fact as possible.”

For a story about death and complication rates by surgeons in 2015, ProPublica included a Surgeon Scorecard with a searchable database readers could use to look up specific doctors. The site also included a detailed discussion of its methodology for calculating rates, quotes from experts backing up their methods, and an editor’s note from Engelberg describing the reasoning behind the story. At the end of the note, Engelberg invited criticism from readers with a dedicated email address to receive them. While the site has pushed back against some of the criticism, it has taken some of it to heart, such as the fact that it only takes into account inpatient procedures, and will be using it to adjust their methodology for a planned Surgeon Scorecard 2.0.

ProPublica has made a habit of responding publicly to its critics, even when they publish their critiques elsewhere—acknowledging it when they feel the critics have a point, and pushing back when they feel like they don’t. “At the end of the day, we live in a universe where people are going to say things about your work, and there is no waving it off, like we have the printing press and you don’t,” Engelberg says.

In some cases, ProPublica has seen unintended consequences from its transparency—as was the case when it published a database of rates of prescriptions by doctors to draw attention to an epidemic of overprescribing opioids and other potentially dangerous narcotics. Analyzing web traffic, ProPublica’s editors noticed an uptick in traffic to the database, after Google searches such as “doctors who prescribe narcotics easily,” implying that readers were using the database to find doctors to prescribe them drugs.

Rather than pulling the database, ProPublica made the fact a further exercise in transparency, running an editor’s note explaining the problem, and adding a new disclaimer to the database warning about the dangers of addictive drugs. “This is an ethically tricky area,” says Engelberg. “We weighed the possibility that we were going to make it worse, but if you are in a glass house cajoling institutions to be transparent, then to know something about our work and not make it public seemed against the principles of what we do.”In deciding whether and how to release controversial documents, the more publications can let the reader into their decision-making process, the better they might be received by audiences. In January 2017, for example, when BuzzFeed released the Steele dossier containing allegations that the Trump administration colluded with the Russians, for example, it provided little explanation of the pros and cons of making the unverified document public—saying only that it wanted to let “Americans make up their own minds about the allegations.”

The big question right now is whether such transparency will lead to an increase in trust

Arguably, the publication could have taken readers behind the scenes to provide more detail about how they made this tricky journalistic decision, and how it aligned with their ethical and procedural policies, says Elizabeth. Such a thoughtful explanation may have mitigated some of the questioning and backlash it received from politicians and other news outlets about the choice. “I do believe BuzzFeed editors could have offered readers a little more gut-level transparency about their decision to release the dossier,” Elizabeth says. “But every one of these situations is an opportunity for all of us to figure out how to do it better next time.”

In addition to opening up their sources to scrutiny, some publications and journalists have taken the public inside the reporting process itself—as The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold has done while reporting on Donald Trump’s supposed donations to charity. From the start of his reporting, Fahrenthold posted his progress on Twitter, showing his followers photos of his notebook with charities he was exploring, and even trading barbs with Trump himself. The openness paid off with members of the public, and even other journalists tweeting him tips—including one Univision journalist alerting him to the location of a portrait of himself Trump had bought with charity money, hanging on the wall at a Florida golf club.

When the nonprofit Project Veritas set up a sting operation to trick the Post’s reporters with a false claim of having been impregnated by U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, the Post produced a story and 10-minute video about how it uncovered the sting, and even set up a sting of its own, showing the woman in an interview with a Post reporter, and explaining why it broke the agreement of confidentiality, since she had misrepresented herself in an attempt to embarrass the paper.

The Post further elaborated on how it broke the story about Roy Moore’s legitimate accusers in a video produced by reporter Libby Casey, part of a new series called “How to Be a Journalist,” which seeks to take readers inside the goings-on of the newsroom. “I was getting so many questions from friends and other people who aren’t in media about how we do what we do,” she says. “It showed me that with a little transparency we could turn our storytelling around to show how we do our work.”

Casey interviews her colleagues in an irreverent, almost jaunty style in an effort to present them in an authentic, human light. In interviewing reporter Stephanie McCrummen about the Roy Moore story, for example, she discusses the anxiety reporters feel knocking on doors with a notepad ready. Another video features database editor Steven Rich, who describes how he submitted 1,500 FOIA requests last year—detailing how readers can submit their own open records request to the government. “If we can demystify the process, it does empower people to learn what their own role can be in a democracy.”

The Toronto Star has quickly become a model of transparency with its efforts to open up the newsroom to reader scrutiny. Last year, the paper’s managing editor Irene Gentle started seeing an uptick in complaints and harassment against the paper that corresponded to the skepticism south of the border against fake news. “She became frustrated by the fact that we know there is a lot of hard work behind our journalism that is being done by solid ethical principles,” says public editor Kathy English, “but readers weren’t getting that.”

Starting in May last year, the paper launched its own Trust Project, hiring a transparency reporter, Kenyon Wallace, whose beat is the newsroom; each week he picks a topic and interviews reporters about how they cover it. So far topics have included how the paper covers politics, how the science reporter vets scientific claims, and how the restaurant critic reviews new eateries. Back in January, Star reporters and editors participated in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on Reddit, in which readers queried them on issues ranging from the paper’s corrections policies to how it covers outrageous candidates like Toronto’s late mayor Rob Ford.

That effort was driven by the younger journalists, says English, despite qualms by her and other veteran colleagues. “I didn’t know what to expect and whether there might be some ugly trolling—and there was a little bit,” she says. To keep the conversation civil, however, the paper had an experienced moderator approve comments and make sure questions didn’t get out of hand. The Star’s transparency efforts may be working; according to the Edelman Trust Barometer, trust of journalism rose 10 points in Canada over the past year, to 61 percent. While she says the Star can’t take complete credit for it, as one of the country’s biggest newspapers, it may have had something to do with it.

More outlets are experimenting with social media as a way to create communities for subscribers to interact directly with reporters and staff. The Dallas Morning News created a special Facebook group in September for subscribers only, where they can ask reporters and editors about decisions the paper has made; it’s now up to 1,400 members. “We wanted to get to know them and for them to get to know us as a way to overcome some of the mistrust that sometimes exists,” says engagement editor Hannah Wise.

Wise was worried initially that the group would be one big forum for complaints. But having discussions play out in public has given the paper a way to show it cares and correct misunderstandings. When one reader complained about not having his paper delivered, editor in chief Mike Wilson jumped in to make sure he got a replacement. When a headline was incorrect, some subscribers complained the paper didn’t have copyeditors anymore. “It was late at night, and I said, we do have copyeditors, they are still here right now trying to do work—you are welcome to meet them,” says Wise.

In other cases, admitting mistakes has led to more open dialogue. When a reporter was covering an issue of separation of church and state in a nearby suburb, she inadvertently used the word “crusade,” which readers pushed back on as an unfair use of a religious term. The reporter admitted that she hadn’t intended to use the word in that way, and would be more careful in the future. “Since then, the person who has given her the most grief has ‘liked’ every story she’s written,” Wise says.

In another case, some readers were upset by a weekend guide featuring a gay couple on the cover. Wise explained to the group that the paper’s role was to reflect the community, and not censor things some readers might not agree with. “We let the community have the discussion, and I was heartened to see that the majority of the group said, how can you say this about people who love each other?”

In addition to inviting readers virtually into the newsroom, some publications have even gone so far as to invite them in physically as well. City Bureau, a nonprofit news organization in Chicago, hosts a “public newsroom” every Thursday night, in which reporters offer talks and workshops on their investigative reporting processes and solicit public advice and contributions.

Matt DeRienzo took that a step further as Connecticut statewide editor for Digital First Media, opening up a “newsroom café” to the public that was part coffee shop, part community center, and part library where people could peruse the publication’s archives. “The Little League and the Garden Club would meet right inside our newsroom,” DeRienzo says. Over time, having community members in the newsroom resulted in giving journalists more sources and perspectives they could work into stories, adding more nuance and complexity.

As much as the online environment has eroded trust and created the need for more transparency, it also offers unique tools to increase transparency

At the same time the publication was physically inviting people into the newsroom, it was also aggressively soliciting feedback on the web through its corrections policy. Rather than just posting corrections when errors were made, the site included a box prominently placed on every story that asked the community to fact-check articles, and contact the reporter through a form if anything was incorrect. In addition to correcting errors, readers often wrote in with missing information and additional perspective that reporters sometimes worked into other stories. “People don’t assume you are open to that unless you tell them,” says DeRienzo, who is now executive director of Local Independent Online News (LION) Publishers. “It led to a lot more context and accuracy.” For publications considering increasing transparency, the decision takes forethought and planning. “It’s a lot of work and very resource-intensive,” says Wikimedia’s Kramer. She recommends publications think first about their reasons for wanting to be more transparent, whether it’s to acquire deeper sources, improve trust with readers, or create more engagement about local issues, and then choose the elements of transparency likely to further those goals. However it’s implemented, she says, the push has to come from the top, and be tied to clear performance goals for employees so they have an incentive to spend the extra effort. “It has to be something management supports and creates a structure for,” she says.

For journalists used to keeping their decisions on what to include and not include in stories to themselves, opening up what they do to such scrutiny can be disconcerting to say the least. “It makes journalists uncomfortable sometimes, because they feel like it is making them a part of the story rather than being able to hide what we do,” says the Democracy Fund’s Stearns. Journalists spend a lot of time and care crafting their stories to give them the proper balance and serve an interpreting function for the audiences—exposing processes and source material can be nerve-racking.

“Those fears are absolutely legitimate,” says Stearns. “It’s a scary thing, and I totally honor and respect that. The question for me is not should we do it or shouldn’t we, but when should we do it?” Just because a publication embraces transparency doesn’t mean that reporters have to post interviews and notes for every story. Publications should be strategic, say advocates, choosing stories to start that might be important or controversial, such as investigative stories or enterprise journalism exposing an issue of pressing local concern. “It may feel risky,” says Stearns, “but it will also make you unimpeachable.”

The year that “Putin’s Revenge” was broadcast was incorrect in an earlier version of the caption. The correct year is 2017, not 2012.

 Although the revolving door policy is too obvious for everyone to see, still the crime needs to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. 

 Indeed, running after the crooks in the establishment is like shooting for the stars. But what about pedophilia, or rape of minors by those who are sick and drunk of their undeserved power?

 Recently, two notable whistleblowers have come to the fore, i.e. a DHS insider and an FBI Anon, unverified reports said.

According to our DHS Insider,

 “There is a concerted attack on Sessions due to his zeroing in on the pedophilia scandal called Pedogate. John McCain and Lindsay Graham are secretly working with Chuck Schumer and members of the clandestine services of both US and Israel to remove Sessions, or at least stop the Pedophilia investigation in its tracks.” 

 As you probably know, what is now becoming known as “Pedogate” represents not only hundreds of millions of dollars in hush money, but also untold political influence-peddling.

 Rince Pribus is also a key player in covering up the scandal, as is Adam Schiff, Nancy Pelosi, John Podesta , Hillary and Bill Clinton, and of course Barack Obama.

 When Netanyahu met with Trump, Netanyahu attempted to convince Trump the pedophilia scandal was “a false premise”. Netanyahu is also scared of exposure. Trump became suspicious and has become increasingly aware of how big the pedophile scandal is.

 Trump has told several in his inner circle that [quoted by our insider] “the swamp is much more polluted than I expected“. He has spoken to Chris Christie extensively about the Pedophilia ring(s) and it has been determined that branches of the ring spread as far as Asia, and are rooted in the deepest corners of both the US and the UK political system.

 Trump was overheard telling his daughter [quoted by our source] “This town is pedophile central…” and “This makes me sick“.

 Trump was urged to use the term “ ” rather than in his recent mention of it. Our insider also told us the true reason Barron does not live in DC is that they fear for Barron’s safety.

 Our source also had more information on Anthony Weiner’s laptop. The source says there are over 375 high profile names that are connected to the Pedophile rings. Wiener is currently “singing like a bird” and has offered to tell all, in exchange for Israeli citizenship, a deal likely to conclude. Schumer has repeatedly sought updates on the information and according to our source, has reached out to Wiener dozens of times. Our source assures us a check of Schumer’s iPhone will authenticate this. Schumer uses both an android and an iPhone.

 Our source states,

 One secret service agent is quietly telling us that Trump is deeply troubled by the extent of the pedophilia ring and Ivanka Trump has counseled her father to “lay the traps carefully.”

 McCain and Schumer’s calls are currently being monitored, and at some point, they will be leaked. There is growing fury within the Intelligence Community at the huge cover up.

 There is a traitor within President Trump’s inner circle that will be exposed within weeks. This traitor was leaking when and where new Attorney General Sessions intended to arrest or indict suspected pedophiles within the political system.

 As it stands now, Trump is bugged, from AF1 to Oval Office. This situation is being remedied this week, according to our source.

 The key steps to exposing the pedophilia cover up are as follows.
• At this time, Alan Dershowitz has the FULL list of visitors to Epstein’s island. The list is comprehensive and is kept in an encrypted file. Dershowitz lied to his Mossad handlers and told them he handed over everything. Untrue.
• Trace Lindsey Graham’s movements over the past 15 years, including any ‘close calls’
• DynCorp along with the Clinton Foundation hide years of sordid history. Focus attention there.
• Anthony Wiener’s hard drive. There are already attempts within CIA to create dis-information campaigns. What the Deep State fears most is public outrage at pedophilia. Our DHS insider ended with this message:

 “Three words of advice: Beware false paths. This is my last communication. FBI anon will be surfacing shortly with more.”

FBI Insider EXCLUSIVE! CALIFORNIA #PizzaGate PEDO-RINGS UNDER INVESTIGATION HOLLYWOOD/NAPA VALLEY and MORE

Our FBI anon friend who predicted PizzaGate has allowed me to interview him with ten short questions. This is BIG. It looks like the #PizzaGate scandal is going to bring down some sick Senators, Congressmen, Wall Street bankers, Journalists and other assorted demonic creatures.

 I asked him some questions and I did not expect the answers I got. Fully one third of our Government is a Pedoring!

 Q: Back in July, you astounded the world by predicting #PizzaGate when you posted on 4chan. How did you know?

 A: We did not predict PizzaGate. What we did do is point out that the Clinton Foundation had and has deep ties to a network of pedophiliacs. It’s now slowly coming to light with the new revelations regarding Epstein and Weiner. There is lots more to come. We also got some things wrong. The VP pick, and honestly, we did not expect WJC to survive into 2017.

 Q: You were laughed at when you first posted, but 95% of what you stated ended up being true. How does it feel to be vindicated?

 A: We expect that. 4chan was the right environment to engage those on the “edge world” as we call it. Some considered our message to be a LARP. That’s fine. We threw in some false paths to ensure plausible deniability. However, when internet sleuths and citizen journalists began hunting for confirmation of our claims, we achieved the spiral effect we were seeking.

 Q: Can you tell us what to expect in the near future?

 A: We expect some movement next week. High level arrests of close to 3 dozen pedophile politicians, some who are quite well known. Another 42 people also expected to be arrested in the drag net. 72 in all.

 Q: But why pre-announce on 4chan? Doesn’t that compromise the sting?

 A: There is furious push back to not make arrests. There are internal and nefarious forces attempting to thwart the operation. The cesspool called DC is one big extortion arena. Our politicians are either being extorted for being pedophiles, or they are in the pocket of Bankers, Big Oil, Israel or Saudi Arabia. If Israel and the Saudis can no longer extort politicians for their sexual deviance, where do they make their money and wield their influence? If bankers cannot stop the destruction of their puppet politicians, how do they keep the “fix” in place? Our alphabet agencies are compromised. Our homeland security and defense apparatus has become politically corrupted. How can we stand by while our powerful leaders impose law on one hand, and sexually abuse our children with another?

 Q: Good points. So, is PizzaGate connected to the West Coast?

 A: There is serious connection. Not necessarily connecting to the arrests we hope to see next week, but you may want to look into CES, and also NP and see if that politician has any Pizzadust on their shoes.

 Q: Nancy Pelosi?

 A: No comment

 Q; Can you provide some more initials of politicians being investigated?

 A: Sure BF, MB, TK, DF, JM, LG There are also journalists, pundits, money men, lobbyists. Many are being tracked down and are about to be exposed, arrested, drained. Some may off themselves when they realize they risk prison, ruination, loss of power, etc.

 Q: Can you tell us where active Political pedorings in America exist now?

 A: In every state. The main concentration is in the East and in the West. In the East, NYC, the resort towns, and of course DC. Out west, Hollywood, Beverly Hills,Napa Valley, Marin County.

 Q: Ok, so wealthy areas. But why is nothing done about it?

 A It’s covered up. Law Enforcement takes their orders from the DC power brokers. AG’s, police chiefs, etc are ordered to cover up the Pedophile rings and their players.Law Makers are allowed to be Law Breakers, because they create the law and rule over those that enforce the law. We believe that the NOBODY is above the law.

 Q: But why go to a public forum like 4chan?

 A: Because we need the American people to join in this fight. Do you want our children targeted, raped, damaged? Do we want our politicians belonging to some Saudi, or some Israeli extortionist? Do we want our politicians to be owned by Goldman Sachs? Do you want your daughter to end up alone with a Jeffery Epstein, Alan Dershowitz, or Anthony Wiener?

 Q: Is Wiener connected to the upcoming arrests of 30 high profile politicians?

 A: Yes, and more directly, Wiener was part of ring that includes his mentor. Ultimately, we are looking at close to 30% of the political spectrum.

 On that note, I have said enough. Good luck.

Again, this is yet to be verified, and we maintain that we will only believe it when we see these pedophiles are paraded in handcuffs into the nearest FEMA camp available.

 In the meantime, we will be entertaining another angle to the Pizzagate and Pedogate scandals on the next post.

1346,"Jack Burkman is an American lobbyist and conspiracy theorist.[2][3] Burkman drew significant media attention in 2014 for organizing a protest against the Dallas Cowboys of the NFL after the team signed Michael Sam, an openly gay football player, to its practice squad.[4][5][6] He is also known for his involvement with far-right conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl in multiple plots that attempted to frame public figures for fictitious sexual assaults, including in October 2018 against U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, in April 2019 against 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, and in April 2020 against White House Coronavirus Task Force member Anthony Fauci.[7][8][9][10]

Burkman is the president of the lobbying firm Burkman Associates, LLC and the head of the conservative organization American Decency. He is the host of the Behind the Curtain podcast.

Burkman was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[1] He earned a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center.[1]

On October 30, 2018, NBC News and The Atlantic published articles detailing a scheme to falsely accuse U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller of sexual misconduct in 1974. The articles reported that on October 17, 2018, several journalists received emails from a person claiming to be named ""Lorraine Parsons"" that asserted Burkman had hired a man with Surefire Intelligence, a company created by far-right conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl, to offer her more than $20,000 to sign an affidavit falsely accusing Mueller of sexual misconduct and workplace harassment. ""Parsons"" told the reporters she had worked with Mueller at the law firm Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro in 1974, and that the man from Surefire had asked her to falsely accuse Mueller of engaging in misconduct during that time. Mueller worked at Pillsbury in 1974, but the firm told reporters they had no record of any Lorraine Parsons ever working there. ""Parsons"" declined reporters' requests to speak on the phone, and none of the reporters published the story until the scheme became evident.[7][8]

On October 31, Burkman tweeted and Wohl retweeted that Parsons did not exist, denying involvement in the matter, and calling it ""a hoax designed to distract the nation from [Burkman's] press conference"" to be held the next day.[11] Burkman denied knowing ""Parsons"", although The Atlantic noted that he posted a video on his Facebook page around the same time Taub and ""Parsons"" began to be contacted by Surefire Intelligence, asserting without evidence that Mueller ""has a whole lifetime history of harassing women.""[8] Burkman tweeted that at the press conference he would ""reveal the first of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's sex assault victims"" and ""prove that he is a drunk and a sexual abuser.""[12][13][14] Wohl and Burkman convened a press conference outside Washington on November 1, ostensibly to present a woman who they said signed an affidavit, which The Gateway Pundit had published, accusing Mueller of raping her in a New York hotel room in 2010—on a date he was contemporaneously reported by the Washington Post to be serving jury duty in Washington.[15] The men accused Mueller's office of ""leaking"" the eight year-old Post story to discredit their allegations. The purported accuser, Carolyne Cass, did not appear at the press conference as they had initially stated she would, and the men asserted she had panicked in fear of her life and taken a flight to another location.[16][17]

On April 22, 2019, Jack Burkman tweeted ""2020 is shaping up to be more exciting than 2016. Looking like it will be Trump vs. Mayor Pete! Get the popcorn ready!""[9]

On April 28, a Medium post emerged under the name of a gay Republican college student, alleging that Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana and a Democratic presidential candidate for 2020, had sexually assaulted him in February. A Twitter account created just a month prior under the student's name also emerged. The next day, The Daily Beast reported that Burkman and Jacob Wohl had tried to convince young Republican men to make false accusations of sexual assault against Buttigieg. One man attested that Burkman and Wohl had tried to convince him to falsely accuse Buttigieg of assaulting him when he was too drunk to consent. According to the source, Burkman and Wohl contacted him under the false identities ""Matt Teller"" and ""Bill"", but he recognized Wohl due to Wohl's internet notoriety and decided to record their conversation. He then provided the recording to The Daily Beast, which wrote that it corroborated the man's claims with the aid of an audio forensics analyst who determined that one man in the recording was ""highly likely"" to be Wohl.[9][18][19][20]

The student who was being impersonated on Medium and Twitter told The Daily Beast that Burkman and Wohl flew him to Washington, D.C. under the guise of speaking about politics from the perspective of a gay Republican, and that he was unaware they were trying to involve him in their scheme. He said that he had to pretend that he was taking a nap in order to escape Burkman's residence, and that they had created the Medium profile and a Twitter profile claiming to be him without his permission.[9][18]

Burkman and Wohl announced that they would be holding a press conference at Burkman's house on May 8 to continue their accusations against Buttigieg. On May 7, Burkman tweeted a link to an event called ""Protest Against Homophobic Bigots"" and wrote, ""Hundreds of leftist protestors are set to descend on our Wednesday Press conference. We WILL NOT surrender to the mob. We’ve called in extra security to guard our safety and that of our partners in the media."" The protest was discovered to be fake, organized by Wohl himself, when attendees received confirmation emails containing the email address wohlthinktank@gmail.com, which Wohl had used in the past.[21] Mediaite noted that events may be registered with false contact information, but that Eventbrite would have emailed the address used by the organizer allowing them to delete or edit the event.[22] However, Wohl denied involvement in creating the event page. Eventbrite later took down the event page citing their rules against ""inauthentic content"".[21]

At the May 8 press conference, Burkman and Wohl displayed footage of the student they had flown to Washington, D.C. drinking a coffee as proof that the student was not being coerced, with Wohl explaining that ""Most forced coercion events… do not involve caramel frappuccino."" During the press conference, the student released a statement describing Burkman and Wohl as ""chronic liars"" and stating that he would not be at the press conference as they had claimed. No protesters appeared at the fake protest of the press conference that Wohl himself had attempted to organize.[23]

In a late April 2020 press release, a woman claimed to have been sexually assaulted in 2014 by Dr. Anthony Fauci, a prominent member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Only The Daily Dot reported on the allegation, debunking it as a likely smear attempt.[24] On May 2, 2020, the woman contacted Reason Magazine to confess that she and another woman had been paid by Burkman and Wohl to fabricate the allegations against Fauci. According to Reason, the woman contacted Burkman and Wohl and recorded their phone conversation. In that call, Wohl told her, ""You did a good job, you got paid. What's the problem?"" Burkman suggested that Fauci deserved the smear: ""This guy shut the country down. He put 40 million people out of work. In a situation like that, you have to make up whatever you have to make up to stop that train and that's the way life works, OK? That's the way it goes... Mother Nature has to clean the barn every so often. How real is it? Who knows? So what if 1 percent of the population goes? So what if you lose 400,000 people? Two hundred thousand were elderly, the other 200,000 are the bottom of society. You got to clean out the barn. If it's real, it's a positive thing, for God's sake.""[10]

On October 1, 2019, Burkman and Jacob Wohl held a press conference on the front steps of Burkman's home in which they claimed to know the identity of the whistleblower who revealed possible impropriety by President Trump involving Ukraine, though they said they could not release it. The press conference was sparsely attended and described by The Washington Post as another in a series of events in which Burkman and Wohl ""routinely announce they have discovered smoking-gun revelations against Trump’s rivals, then humiliate themselves when they fail to produce any evidence"".[25]

On October 3, 2019, Burkman and Wohl announced a press conference in which they said a 24-year-old former United States Marine would claim he had an affair with Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren; the announcement was met with mockery and disbelief, and generally viewed as another of Burkman and Wohl's false allegations.[26]

On Friday, October 11, 2019, Burkman announced via Twitter that he and Wohl had scheduled a news conference for Monday, October 14. The press release stated that a purported illegal drug dealer would be presented, who would provide evidence that he sold illicit drugs to Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, House Sub-Committee on Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and other unnamed members of Congress.[27]

In June 2016, Burkman held an event called ""Lobbyists for Trump"" and invited all major lobbyists of Washington, D.C. to help raise money for Donald Trump's presidential campaign.[28][29] In July 2016, he helped fundraise for Free the Delegates, an anti-Trump effort to change the delegate rules for the 2016 Republican National Convention.[30]

On March 19, 2020, Twitter suspended Burkman's account after he tweeted unevidenced claims about impending nationwide food shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A Twitter spokesperson said the account had been suspended for repeated infractions of Twitter rules, including making false statements about COVID-19.[31]

Burkman heads the organization American Decency, a conservative organization that claims to have 3.62 million members, though this claim is unverified.[32] The organization drew media attention in 2014 when Burkman announced plans to protest the Dallas Cowboys' signing of Michael Sam, the first publicly gay player to be drafted in the NFL.[32][33][34] Burkman called for legislation that would prohibit homosexuals from playing in the NFL, though this proposed legislation was never formally introduced in the House of Representatives and never received a vote.[35]

Burkman started investigating the murder of Seth Rich in September 2016 after the Rich family accepted his pro bono public relations services.[36] The Rich family and Burkman held a joint press conference about the murder in November 2016.[36][37]

In January 2017, Burkman launched an advertising campaign in Northwest D.C. searching for information regarding Rich's death. This included billboard advertisements and canvassing with flyers.[38][39] In late February, Burkman started spreading conspiracy theories by telling media outlets that he had a lead that the Russian government was involved in Rich's death,[40] and the Rich family distanced itself from Burkman.[41] In March 2017, Burkman started ""The Profiling Project"", an independent investigative attempt to solve the murder of Seth Rich with help from forensics students at George Washington University.[42][43] He hired Kevin Doherty, a former U.S. Marine and special agent, to help with the project, although tensions developed when Burkman felt Doherty was speaking to reporters when he shouldn't have been and trying to take control of the project. In July 2017, Burkman fired Doherty and sent him a cease and desist letter. In March 2018, Doherty lured Burkman to a parking garage by claiming to have evidence of FBI misconduct.

When Burkman arrived, Doherty shot him in the buttocks and thigh and hit him with an SUV, breaking Burkman's arm. Doherty was sentenced to nine years in prison.[44]

11,"Do your own research, we have done ours and are satisfied that Marina Abramovic is exactly who we think she is, a New Age witch who hides behind performance art to promote Satanism, witchcraft, and all the rest of her demonic nonsense. So with that, let’s take a look at what Microsoft, the same company who is funding ID2020, is doing with Abramovic. Of course, me writing all these words are actually completely unnecessary, because when you watch the promotional video Microsoft has produced to promote her, it’s lights out and case closed.

Microsoft is the company that funds Mark of the Beast digital identification company ID2020, and now they are promoting New Age witch Marina Abramovic who is best known for the satanic practice of spirit cooking. Is this really someone you would want to enter into holographic mixed reality with?

Isuppose you can get away with just about anything if you call yourself a ‘performance artist’ instead of what you actually are, in this case we are talking about a High Priestess of modern-day Satanism, Marina Abramovic. She is a wicked woman whose ‘performance art‘ usually revolves around snakes, pig’s blood, images of Baphomet, and all the rest of that garbage. But nothing to see her, people, Marina is just an ‘edgy performance artist’, that’s all. Yeah, right.

“And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.” 2 Chronicles 33:6 (KJB)

Take a look at an article published by the UCLA Center for European and Russian Studies back in 2018, where they calmly and rationally discussed the rise importance of witchcraft in Hollywood. It’s not simply enlightening, it’s a stunning eye-opener, and of course we see Marina Abramovic featured prominently in it.

“WE SEEM TO BE LIVING IN BEWITCHED TIMES. WITCHES ARE EVERYWHERE, OR RATHER: VICTIMS OF ALLEGED WITCH HUNTS POP UP ALL OVER THE PLACE, PREFERABLE ON TWITTER OR OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS.

But do your own research, we have done ours and are satisfied that Marina Abramovic is exactly who we think she is, a New Age witch who hides behind performance art to promote Satanism, witchcraft, and all the rest of her demonic nonsense. So with that, let’s take a look at what Microsoft, the same company who is finding ID2020 is doing with Abramovic. Of course, me writing all these words are actually completely unnecessary, because when you watch the promotional video Microsoft has produced to promote her, it’s lights out and case closed.

Now if you have half a brain, after everything we present to you here, the last place you want to be is in a virtual world with a New Age witch known for satanism, gore and cannibalism. But this is where evil end times company Microsoft wants to take you, don’t go.

FROM MICROSOFT: Marina Abramovic is likely the most acclaimed performance artist living today. Known for risky performances that push the limits of human endurance, it’s difficult to overstate her importance within the art world and pop culture at large.

From the 1970s through to the present, she has created dozens of incredibly impactful works that explore themes of courage, ego, endurance, and spirituality. In 2010, her iconic work The Artist Is Present, was the biggest exhibition at New York City’s MoMA ever. In the piece, she sat still for eight hours, every day, for nearly three months, sustaining eye contact with whomever sat across from her.

“Any medium—visual, aural, even material—is really just a conduit for the energy of the artist to reach the understanding of the audience. In mixed reality we’ve achieved the first medium capable of presenting a recorded performance as an event happening now,” says Todd. “The artist is forever, in this case, which changes the very nature of what the conduit means. But for the audience with The Life, it’s my hope that they never think about such things. Instead I want them to walk away feeling like they were just in the room with Marina.”

Marina’s most recent piece, The Life, further solidifies her unconventional and innovative approach to performance art—it’s her first artwork to harness mixed reality. Brought to life with the HoloLens 2, the 19-minute performance follows Abramović, whose phantom-like virtual image appears in a vibrant red dress as she explores the space and its borders. Viewers become mesmerized by her mindful movements, her virtual image dissolving as she interacts with the installation’s borders.

For the first time, viewers are able to experience performance art without boundaries—and without the artist technically being “present.” As soon as they don the HoloLens 2 headset, Abramović’s fully realized form takes shape before their eyes. READ MORE

If a picture says a thousand words, how many words is this video telling you? Watch and find out. But at the very least you will instantly see why we call her a New Age witch and a satanist, oops, sorry, performance artist.

The art market is one of the few bubbles that hasn’t popped yet – many will remember Maurizio Cattelan’s banana, taped to the wall at Art Basel Miami Beach in December, selling for $120,000 until someone plucked it off the wall and ate it – at which point it was replaced with another, higher-priced banana.

Abramovic’s performance work – transient by definition – is a little more difficult to sell, but Microsoft seemed to have nailed it down with the HoloLens thing. Add in the general bad feeling against Microsoft founder and world’s second-richest-man Bill Gates, who has been ubiquitous throughout the coronavirus epidemic pushing “digital certificates” and 18-month lockdowns as the answer to the virus, despite lacking a medical degree or any expertise in the field beyond the money he’s poured into mass vaccination campaigns, and the backlash becomes understandable.

Hashtags like #BillGatesIsNotYourFriend and #BillGatesPublicEnemyNumber1 have proliferated in recent weeks as many of the same researchers who probed Abramovic’s performance past have dug into Gates’ questionable statements in support of microchipping the world and the myriad apparent conflicts of interest between the companies he invests in and the global health causes he promotes. Given his track record, his stated goal of vaccinating seven billion people has also raised a few eyebrows.",conspiracy
835,"YouTube Moderators are calling out the platform for ignoring reports of abusive content, and allowing thousands of sexual predators to flourish.

As the mainstream media catches up to the fact that YouTube has become a breeding ground for pedophiles with hundreds of questionable videos — with billions of views — and thousands of sexual comments that face little oversight, the platform’s moderators are claiming that its system for reporting abuse has not been working properly for over a year.

A group of moderators told the BBC that YouTube has allowed at least 100,000 predatory accounts to leave inappropriate comments on videos with no repercussions as “YouTube’s system for reporting sexualized comments left on children’s videos has not been functioning correctly for more than a year.”

The moderators, who are referred to as YouTube’s “Trusted Flaggers,” are charged with flagging inappropriate content and reporting the users who are violating the platform’s policies. However, they claim that in many cases, the accounts they report face no consequences.

An investigation conducted by BBC reporter Elizabeth Cassin looked into the sexual, lewd and other inappropriate comments that are left on YouTube’s videos for children—even after those accounts are reported by moderators.

“Although the videos themselves are completely innocent, there are attempts from adults to collect personal information from children, and requests for them to remove clothing,” Cassin said. “These are a clear violation of YouTube’s child endangerment policies. So you might expect that comments like these would be removed immediately once reported—but no. It’s claimed that one key part of YouTube’s mechanism for reporting comments like these hasn’t been working properly for over a year, so some obscene comments directed at children have remained on the site.”

After making a list of comments they believed were in clear violation of YouTube’s child endangerment policies, Cassin’s team reported 28 accounts to YouTube. “Two weeks later, 23 of these accounts still remained on the site,” Cassin said.

94,"Day care sexual abuse case in the 1980s that overlapped with the Satanic Ritual Abuse panic

The McMartin preschool trial was a day care sexual abuse case in the 1980s, prosecuted by the Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner.[1] Members of the McMartin family, who operated a preschool in Manhattan Beach, California, were charged with numerous acts of sexual abuse of children in their care. Accusations were made in 1983, arrests and the pretrial investigation took place from 1984 to 1987, and trials ran from 1987 to 1990. The case lasted seven years but resulted in no convictions, and all charges were dropped in 1990. By the case's end, it had become the longest and most expensive in American history.[2][3] The case was part of day-care sex-abuse hysteria, a moral panic over alleged Satanic ritual abuse in the 1980s and early 1990s.

In 1983, Judy Johnson, mother of one of the Manhattan Beach, California, preschool's young students, reported to the police that her son had been sodomized by her estranged husband and by McMartin teacher Ray Buckey.[4][5] Ray Buckey was the grandson of school founder Virginia McMartin and son of administrator Peggy McMartin Buckey. Johnson's belief that her son had been abused began when her son had painful bowel movements. What happened next is still disputed. Some sources state that at that time, Johnson's son denied her suggestion that his preschool teachers had molested him, whereas others say he confirmed the abuse.[4][6]

In addition, Johnson also made several more accusations, including that people at the daycare had sexual encounters with animals, that ""Peggy drilled a child under the arms"" and ""Ray flew in the air.""[2][7] Ray Buckey was questioned, but was not prosecuted due to lack of evidence. The police then sent a form letter to about 200 parents of students at the McMartin school, stating that their children might have been abused, and asking the parents to question their children. The text of the letter read:[4]

September 8, 1983. Dear Parent: This Department is conducting a criminal investigation involving child molestation (288 P.C.) Ray Buckey, an employee of Virginia McMartin's Pre-School, was arrested September 7, 1983 by this Department. The following procedure is obviously an unpleasant one, but to protect the rights of your children as well as the rights of the accused, this inquiry is necessary for a complete investigation. Records indicate that your child has been or is currently a student at the pre-school. We are asking your assistance in this continuing investigation. Please question your child to see if he or she has been a witness to any crime or if he or she has been a victim. Our investigation indicates that possible criminal acts include: oral sex, fondling of genitals, buttock or chest area, and sodomy, possibly committed under the pretense of ""taking the child's temperature."" Also photos may have been taken of children without their clothing. Any information from your child regarding having ever observed Ray Buckey to leave a classroom alone with a child during any nap period, or if they have ever observed Ray Buckey tie up a child, is important. Please complete the enclosed information form and return it to this Department in the enclosed stamped return envelope as soon as possible. We will contact you if circumstances dictate same. We ask you to please keep this investigation strictly confidential because of the nature of the charges and the highly emotional effect it could have on our community.

Johnson was diagnosed with and hospitalized for acute paranoid schizophrenia[5][9][10][11] and in 1986 was found dead in her home from complications of chronic alcoholism[4][12] before the preliminary hearing concluded.[13]

Several hundred children were then interviewed by the Children's Institute International (CII), a Los Angeles-based abuse therapy clinic run by Kee MacFarlane. The interviewing techniques used during investigations of the allegations were highly suggestive and invited children to pretend or speculate about supposed events.[14][15] By spring of 1984, it was claimed that 360 children had been abused.[2][9][16] Astrid Heppenstall Heger performed medical examinations and took photos of what she believed to be minute scarring, which she stated was caused by anal penetration. Journalist John Earl believed that her findings were based on unsubstantiated medical histories.[17] Later research demonstrated that the methods of questioning used on the children were extremely suggestive, leading to false accusations.[14] Others believe that the questioning itself may have led to false memory syndrome among the children questioned.[4][6] Only 41 of the original 360 children ultimately testified in the grand jury and pretrial hearings, and fewer than a dozen testified at the actual trials.[18]

Michael P. Maloney, a clinical psychologist and professor of psychiatry, reviewed videotapes of the children's interviews. Maloney, testifying as an expert witness on interviewing children, was highly critical of the techniques used, referring to them as improper, coercive, directive, problematic and adult-directed in a way that forced the children to follow a rigid script. He concluded that ""many of the kids' statements in the interviews were generated by the examiner.""[19] Transcripts and recordings of the interviews contained far more speech from adults than children and demonstrated that, despite the highly coercive interviewing techniques used, initially the children were resistant to interviewers' attempts to elicit disclosures. The recordings of the interviews were instrumental in the jury's refusal to convict, by demonstrating how children could be coerced to giving vivid and dramatic testimonies without having experienced actual abuse.[20] The techniques used were shown to be contrary to the existing guidelines in California for the investigation of cases involving children and child witnesses.[21]

Some of the accusations were described as ""bizarre"",[7] overlapping with accusations that mirrored the emerging satanic ritual abuse panic.[6][22] It was alleged that, in addition to having been sexually abused, they saw witches fly, traveled in a hot-air balloon, and were taken through tunnels.[6] When shown a series of photographs by Danny Davis (the McMartins' lawyer), one child identified actor Chuck Norris as one of the abusers.[23]

Some of the abuse was alleged to have occurred in secret tunnels beneath the school. Several excavations turned up evidence of old buildings on the site and other debris from before the school was built, but no evidence of any secret chambers or tunnels was found.[6] There were claims of orgies at car washes and airports, and of children being flushed down toilets to secret rooms where they would be abused, then cleaned up and presented back to their parents. Some child interviewees talked of a game called ""naked movie star"" and suggested they were forcibly photographed nude.[2][6][24] During trial testimony, some children stated that the ""naked movie star"" game was actually a rhyming taunt used to tease other children – ""What you say is what you are, you're a naked movie star,"" – and had nothing to do with having naked pictures taken.[6]

Johnson, who made the initial allegations, made bizarre and impossible statements about Raymond Buckey, including that he could fly.[2] Though the prosecution asserted Johnson's mental illness was caused by the events of the trial, Johnson had admitted to them that she was mentally ill beforehand. Evidence of Johnson's mental illness was withheld from the defense for three years and, when provided, was in the form of sanitized reports that excluded Johnson's statements, at the order of the prosecution.[25] One of the original prosecutors, Glenn Stevens, left the case in protest and stated that other prosecutors had withheld evidence from the defense, including the information that Johnson's son did not actually identify Ray Buckey in a series of photographs. Stevens also accused Robert Philibosian, the deputy district attorney on the case, of lying and withholding evidence from the court and defense lawyers in order to keep the Buckeys in jail and prevent access to exonerating evidence.[26]

Two trials were conducted for the McMartin preschool case. The first lasted from July 13, 1987, to January 18, 1990,[27] while the second lasted from May 7, 1990, to July 27, 1990.[28][29]

On March 22, 1984, Virginia McMartin, Peggy McMartin Buckey, Ray Buckey, Ray's sister Peggy Ann Buckey and teachers Mary Ann Jackson, Betty Raidor, and Babette Spitler were charged with 115 counts of child abuse, later expanded to 321 counts of child abuse involving 48 children.[2]

In the 20 months of preliminary hearings, the prosecution, led by attorney Lael Rubin, presented their theory of sexual abuse. The children's testimony during the preliminary hearings was inconsistent.[30] Michelle Smith and Lawrence Pazder, co-authors of the now-discredited Satanic ritual abuse autobiography Michelle Remembers, met with the parents and children involved in the case,[31] and were believed by the initial prosecutor Glenn Stevens to have influenced the children's testimony.[32]

In 1986, a new district attorney, Ira Reiner, called the evidence ""incredibly weak"" and dropped all charges against Virginia McMartin, Peggy Ann Buckey, Mary Ann Jackson, Betty Raidor and Babette Spitler.[33] Peggy McMartin Buckey and Ray Buckey remained in custody awaiting trial; Peggy McMartin's bail had been set at $1 million and Ray Buckey had been denied bail.[11]

The first trial opened on July 13, 1987. During the trial, the prosecution presented seven medical witnesses. The defense attempted to rebut them with several witnesses, but the judge limited them to one in order to save time. In their summation, the prosecution argued that they had seven experts on this issue, when the defense only had one.[22]

In 1989, Peggy Anne Buckey's appeal to have her teaching credentials re-instated after their suspension was granted. The judge ruled that there was no credible evidence or corroboration to lead to the license being suspended, and that a review of the videotaped interviews with McMartin children ""reveal[ed] a pronounced absence of any evidence implicating [Peggy Ann] in any wrongdoing and ... raises additional doubts of credibility with respect to the children interviewed or with respect to the value of CII interviewing techniques themselves."" The following day the credentialling board of Sacramento endorsed the ruling and restored Buckey's right to teach.[34]

In October 1987, jailhouse informant George Freeman was called as a witness and testified that Ray Buckey had confessed to him while sharing a cell.[35] Freeman later attempted to flee the country and confessed to perjury in a series of other criminal cases in which he manufactured testimony in exchange for favorable treatment by the prosecution in other cases, in several instances fabricating jailhouse confessions of other inmates. In order to guarantee his testimony during the McMartin case, Freeman was given immunity to previous charges of perjury.

On January 18, 1990, after three years of testimony and nine weeks of deliberation by the jury, Peggy McMartin Buckey was acquitted on all counts.[11] Ray Buckey was cleared on 52 of 65 counts, and freed on bail after more than five years in jail. Nine of 11 jurors at a press conference following the trial stated that they believed the children had been molested but the evidence did not allow them to state who had committed the abuse beyond a reasonable doubt.[36] Eleven out of the thirteen jurors who remained by the end of the trial voted to acquit Buckey of the charges; the refusal of the remaining two to vote for a not guilty verdict resulted in the deadlock. The media overwhelmingly focused on the two jurors who voted guilty at the expense of those who believed Buckey was not guilty.[37]

Ray Buckey was retried later on 6 of the 13 counts of which he was not acquitted in the first trial. The second trial opened on May 7, 1990, and resulted in another hung jury on July 27, 1990. The prosecution then gave up trying to obtain a conviction, and the case was closed with all charges against Ray Buckey dismissed. He had been jailed for five years without ever being convicted of committing any crime.[4][24][38]

In 1988, The New York Times reported that the case ""attracted national attention when the authorities speculated that hundreds of children might have been molested and subjected to satanic rituals"" and ""has teetered on the brink of mistrial"".[39][40]

The media coverage was generally skewed towards an uncritical acceptance of the prosecution's viewpoint.[6] David Shaw of the Los Angeles Times wrote a series of articles, which later won the Pulitzer Prize,[41] discussing the flawed and skewed coverage presented by his own paper on the trial.[42] It was only after the case that coverage of the flaws in the evidence and events presented by witnesses and the prosecution were discussed.[6]

Wayne Satz, at the time a reporter for the Los Angeles ABC affiliate television station KABC, reported on the case and the children's allegations. He presented an unchallenged view of the children's and parents' claims.[43] Satz later entered into a romantic relationship with Kee MacFarlane, the social worker at the Children's Institute International, who was interviewing the children.[43] Another instance of media conflict of interest occurred when David Rosenzweig, the editor at the Los Angeles Times overseeing the coverage, became engaged to marry Lael Rubin, the prosecutor.[2]

The case lasted seven years and cost $15 million,[44] the longest and most expensive criminal case in the history of the United States legal system, and ultimately resulted in no convictions.[2][5][24] The McMartin preschool was closed and the building was dismantled; several of the accused have since died. In 2005, one of the children (as an adult) retracted the allegations of abuse.[18][45]

In The Devil in The Nursery, Margaret Talbot for The New York Times summarized the case:

Mary A. Fischer in an article in Los Angeles magazine said the case was ""simply invented"", and transmogrified into a national cause celebre by the misplaced zeal of six people: Judy Johnson, seriously mentally ill mother who died of alcoholism; Jane Hoag, the detective who investigated the complaints; Kee MacFarlane, the social worker who interviewed the children; Robert Philibosian, the district attorney who was in a losing battle for re-election; Wayne Satz, the television reporter who first reported the case, and Lael Rubin, the prosecutor.[2]

Peggy Ann and Ray Buckey attended the 1997 ""Day of Contrition"" conference in Salem, Massachusetts. They were joined by other victims and experts of the day-care sex-abuse hysteria.[46][47]

In many states, laws were passed allowing children to testify on closed-circuit TV so the children would not be traumatized by facing the accused. The arrangement was supported in Maryland v. Craig, in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that closed circuit testimony was permissible where it was limited to circumstances with a likelihood that a minor may be harmed by testifying in open court. The case also influenced how very young children were questioned for evidence in court cases with concerns over their capacity for suggestibility and false memories. The case and others like it also impacted the investigation of allegations that included young children. Normal police procedure is to record using video, tape or notes in interviews with alleged victims. The initial interviews with children by the CII were recorded, and demonstrated to the jury members in the trial the coercive and suggestive techniques used by CII staff to produce allegations.

These interviews were instrumental in the jury members failing to produce a guilty verdict against Buckey, and several similar trials with similar interviewing techniques produced similar not-guilty verdicts when juries were allowed to view the recordings. These records ended up being extremely valuable to the defense in similar cases. In response, prosecutors and investigators began ""abandoning their tape recorders and notepads"" and a manual was produced for investigating child abuse cases that urged prosecutors and investigators not to record their interviews.[48]

In 1990, parents who believed their children had been abused at the preschool hired archeologist E. Gary Stickel to investigate the site. In May 1990, Stickel claimed he found evidence of tunnels, consistent with the children's accounts, under the McMartin Preschool using ground-penetrating radar.[49]

Others have disagreed with Stickel's conclusions. John Earl wrote in 1995 that the concrete slab floor was undisturbed except for a small patch where the sewer line was tapped into. Once the slab was removed, there was no sign of any materials to line or hold up any tunnels, and the concrete floor would have made it impossible for the defendants to fill in any tunnels once the abuse investigation began. The article concluded that disturbed soil under the slab was from the sewer line and construction fill buried under the slab before it was poured. Further, Earl noted that some fill from beneath the concrete slab was dated to the year 1940.[17]

W. Joseph Wyatt's 2002 report concluded that the so-called tunnels under the preschool were more plausibly explained as a rubbish pit used by the owners of the site before the preschool's construction in 1966. Materials found during the excavation included bottles, tin cans, plywood, inner tubes, as well as the former owner's old mail box. Only three small items found near the edge of the concrete slab were dated after 1966, which Wyatt suggested were most likely dragged into the pit by rats or other scavengers. Moreover, Wyatt speculated that Stickel's conclusions were colored by his collaboration with the parents of the McMartin children.[50]

Shortly after investigation into the McMartin charges began, the funds to research child sexual abuse greatly increased, notably through the budget allocated for the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN). The agency's budget increased from $1.8 million to $7.2 million between 1983 and 1984, increasing to $15 million in 1985, making it the greatest source of funding for child abuse and neglect prevention in the United States. The majority of this budget went toward studies on sexual abuse with only $5 million going towards physical abuse and neglect.

Federal funding was also used to arrange conferences on ritual abuse, providing an aura of respectability as well as allowing prosecutors to exchange tips on the best means of obtaining convictions. A portion of the funds were used to publish the book Behind the Playground Walls, which used a sample of children drawn from the McMartin families. The book claimed to study the effects of ""reported"" rather than actual abuse but portrayed all of the McMartin children as actual victims of abuse despite a lack of convictions during the trials and without mentioning questions about the reality of the accusations.[51][52] Another grant of $173,000 went to David Finkelhor who used the funds to investigate allegations of day care sexual abuse throughout the country, combining the study of verified crimes by admitted pedophiles and unverified accusations of satanic ritual abuse.[53]

In 1995, HBO produced Indictment: The McMartin Trial, a movie based on the trials.[54]

In 2019, Oxygen produced Uncovered: The McMartin Family Trials, a documentary about the events.[55]

353,"On Saturday night hundreds of self-described “deplorables”, arch-conservative internet personalities, trolls-turned-citizen journalists, and conspiracy theory enthusiasts put on their best suits and cocktail dresses to drink, dance and toast the Trump presidency at an exclusive rightwing social gala called A Night For Freedom.

It’s unclear if there was an element of trolling in the decision to hold a pro-Trump bonanza in Manhattan, the same day several hundred thousand people participated in a city-wide “women’s march”, but if there was, then the party’s masterminds were almost foiled at their own game.

Despite elaborate security precautions to prevent infiltration by journalists, protesters and other troublemakers, the event came close to collapsing at the last moment when, in what the event organizers described as a “set-up”, the scheduled venue abruptly canceled the day before.

Organizers scrambled behind the scenes to secure a new venue to accommodate their 750 guests – only for the second venue to also back out at 1am the morning of the event. A Hell’s Kitchen nightclub finally agreed to host, apparently only after one of the event organizers offered to pay $20,000 in cash up front.

Outside the nightclub, black-clad protesters taunted arriving guests while a heavy cordon of police stood watch. But stepping inside felt like entering a separate universe. The atmosphere was somewhere between a political fundraiser – with lots of red, white and blue and, at one point, a spoken-word ode to the American flag – and a high school prom. Music thumped in the background. Men wearing Trump-style red ties were everywhere.

Guests were giddy with the cathartic high that comes from being in the presence of like-minded people. Many had flown in, and one man told me he had driven five hours to attend. Outside was a hostile world of haters, losers, cucks, globalists, social justice warriors, betas, libtards, and soyboys – but inside was a haven where deplorables could speak freely. Fans geeked out as they took selfies with their favorite rightwing YouTube stars.

The evening’s most unexpected guest was Chelsea Manning, who dropped by briefly during the earlier part of the evening to the surprise of those present and the confusion and consternation of leftist social media users, who heard the news on Twitter. Manning later uploaded a picture of herself making a thumbs-down sign, announcing that she had just “[c]rashed the fascist/white supremacist hate brigade party”, but others disputed her characterization of her presence there.

“Yes I literally shook hands with Chelsea Manning [tonight], the left is freaking out, it was not a big deal,” Mike Cernovich, the event’s main organizer, wrote on Twitter. Cernovich, a rightwing muckraker, occasional men’s rights advocate, and self-described “mindset” guru, said he was “glad she stopped by. All are welcome to party with me.”

“Twenty years ago the idea that anyone can get their own [social media] account and troll any senator to their face would be regarded as an absurdity,” Michael Malice, a fixture of the alternative media sphere, told a cheering crowd.

“The gatekeepers who are controlling our information are falling. Twenty years ago there were three channels [sic]. Today there are literally infinite YouTube channels. Infinite Twitter profiles. Infinite Facebook profiles. You can’t silence people any longer.”

At last year’s “DeploraBall” members of the anti-establishment movement then known as the “alt-right” celebrated the inauguration of Donald Trump, a man they credited themselves with having “memed” into the White House over the resistance of a hostile political and media elite. Even then, few Americans had heard the term “alt-right”, and the political establishment was only belatedly recognizing the influence exercised by a network of online alternative media outlets and rightwing social media personalities.

A lot can happen in a year. Today, the movement has a Super Pac. Gateway Pundit, a far-right blog that has been criticized for spreading hoaxes, has been accredited to the White House press corps. Recently Cernovich partnered with BuzzFeed News to release revelations about sexual harassment claims against Michigan representative John Conyers.

As they have moved from the darkest corners of the internet to the white-tableclothed banquet halls of Washington and New York, pro-Trump online provocateurs, famous for their hatred of political correctness, have also been forced to engage in their own project of respectability politics.

Members of the repackaged and somewhat sanitized movement consider themselves populists and nationalists, not bigots. As they see it, one can support, say, hardline immigration policies without being racist. As Gavin McInnes, the co-founder of Vice and founder of the Proud Boys, a “western chauvinist” and anti-feminist group, explained last year to the New Yorker’s Andrew Marantz: “They [white nationalists] care about the white race. We care about Western values.”

‘Do you want to make us look professional, or sloppy?’

In emails to guests leading up to the event, Cernovich laid out strict rules for decorum, dress code and security protocol. “By attending the event, you become a brand ambassador,” he wrote. “Do you want to make us look professional, or do you want us to look sloppy?”

Any journalists requesting press passes would be denied (“I’m bored of the media lying about me and us, and have no interest in press coverage”), and, he added, undercover security personnel would be mingling with the guests to keep an eye out for “negative or toxic people”.

But if “A Night for Freedom” was an opportunity to show off the rebranded and increasingly mainstream alternative right wing, it was also a reminder that “mainstream” is a relative notion. While the “alt-lite” may have successfully distanced itself from the worst extremists, it can sometimes seem unclear exactly how “lite” the new movement is.

A prolific livestreamer who rails against Democrats, the establishment GOP and the “fake news”-peddling media to his hundreds of thousands of Twitter and Periscope followers, Cernovich is known for reflexively accusing his detractors of pedophilia, and he was one of the propagators of “Pizzagate”, the wholly discredited conspiracy theory that high-ranking Democrats were operating a child sex-ring out of the back of a Washington DC pizzeria.

Joining Cernovich as the evening’s headline acts were McInnes; reality TV star and Trump supporter Anna Khait; “political operatives” Jack Posobiec and Ali Alexander; and Stefan Molyneux, a far-right podcaster who advocates “anarcho-capitalism” and racial IQ theories. (Molyneux, who encourages followers to break off contact with their families, has also been accused of operating a therapy cult, a charge he denies.)

In a series of panels the speakers, some of whom seemed rather tipsy, offered their thoughts on a greatest-hits list of favorite topics including Hillary Clinton (“she’s gonna get her time, you guys just wait”), cryptocurrency, the dangers of socialism, George Soros (“the head of the snake”), and the media (“leftist propaganda machine”).

As a group of Proud Boys stood behind him in matching Fred Perry tennis shirts, McInnes argued that women would be happier under traditional gender strictures, using a vulgar physical analogy to describe how he sees young single women as being exploited by men.

He went on, “Why do [progressives] have a problem with traditional people? You’re the ones being left with cats and dogs for sons and daughters.”

This brought McInnes to one of his recurring preoccupations, natalism. He described his pride at being a father and encouraged listeners to have lots of children. “Remember, one [child] is for losers. Two is for fags.”

The evening wore on and the drink flowed freely. In the men’s room a drunk man ranted bitterly about the Women’s March. “Bunch of fucking pussies out there. And fags. All I know is I ain’t getting none!” he added, for anyone wondering.

Up on the roof, groups of people clustered on a smoking patio. Conversation frequently came back to the deep state, Antifa and when Hillary will face justice for her crimes.

One person was complaining about the protesters outside, some of whom had allegedly attacked guests as they entered.

What do you think is behind that sort of behavior? I asked.

Back inside, people danced to the musical stylings of DJ duo Milk N Cooks. On the stage two professional dancers, with identical short blonde hair and American flag leotards, shimmied back and forth.

People flooded to the dancefloor. Men loosened their ties. The DJs cycled through various 90s and early 2000s club hits and bar-mitzvah standards – In Da Club, Can’t Touch This. An older couple slow-danced sweetly to Africa by Toto.

As it neared midnight, Chumbawamba came on – “I get knocked down, but I get up again” – and the crowd shouted triumphantly along: “You are never gonna keep me down.”",mainstream
493,"This book serves as an easy-to-read, up-to-­date practical guide on professional corporate communication. The key market for this book is the Asia-Pacific region, mainly because there is a gap in know-how in corporate communication among many industry sectors. In addition, at present, one cannot find a lot of educational literature about corporate communication in the market. Therefore, this guidebook closes that gap. In Asia, companies are starting to realize the importance of corporate communication in all areas (external and internal corporate communication, crisis communication (Example: TEPCO) and political communication / government relations / lobbying). This is triggered not only by the recent high profile and success of targeted (political) communication in the USA, but also by the notorious export-orientation of many Asian companies and their increasingly multi-national orientation (fostered by M&A and foreign investments). In addition, the increasing importance of online communication and digital/social media is an important reason why existing guidebooks on corporate communication have to be reassessed and modernized. This book focuses on all major aspects of modern corporate communication, including online / digital communication, and covers new developments, such as “fake news”, “post-truths”, “political correctness”, “the art of bridging” and other new phenomena in the world of (corporate) communication. Simple cartoon-style drawings supplement the text in order to facilitate reading and learning. Corporate communication professional, as well as students and professors in business/management programs, will be given tools to effectively and successfully plan and implement corporate communication strategies and tactics in all major areas.",mainstream
294,"This was the decade in which Justin Bieber hoped Anne Frank was a Belieber, Kendall Jenner solved racism with Pepsi and Kate Winslet carried Richard Branson’s mother out of a burning mansion. It was the decade that saw Lars von Trier call himself a Nazi, Lorraine Kelly claim she was an actress playing Lorraine Kelly, and Solange Knowles beat up Jay-Z in a lift. Amanda Bynes wanted Drake to “murder her vagina”, Jessie J won a Chinese reality show, Kelly Osbourne wet herself outside Starbucks, Shia LaBeouf wore a bag on his head and Richard Simmons went missing.

It was also the decade in which we all lost our collective minds. Whether it was down to political discourse or the brain-melting power of the internet, the 2010’s were marked by our increasing indifference to things that would have been outrageous in any other era. Where once stories of A-list insanity would linger for months on end, they are now mere blips on our Twitter feeds, shuffled off after a few hours and replaced with something even more maddening.

But there are still some that managed to stick out, truly odd detours in which famous faces did things too surreal to ignore. Below are the stories that made us gasp the most over 10 years of crazy, from Reese Witherspoon’s shock arrest to Pamela Anderson’s gradual slide into politics.

Randy Quaid is on the run from a shadowy cabal of Hollywood hitmen who have already killed Heath Ledger

The decade began as it meant to go on – with certifiable crazies insisting people were out to get them. In 2010, the Kingpin and Independence Day actor Randy Quaid, along with his wife Evi, decided to hightail it to Canada to escape an assassination plot by a group they dubbed the “Star Whackers”. These so-called Hollywood hitmen had already “whacked” Heath Ledger (who suffered a heart attack, reportedly caused by an prescription drug overdose) and David Carradine (suicide) and poisoned the Entourage actor Jeremy Piven.

According to the Quaids, both Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan were next on their hit list, and they had been personally targeted in an effort to steal Quaid’s acting royalties and the pair’s insurance money.

Things would become odder and more depressing for the pair as the decade went on, peaking in 2015 when the Quaids uploaded a series of sex tapes to the internet – one of which featured Evi wearing nothing but a Rupert Murdoch mask.

What made the Quaid story so significant in recent years, however, is how un-shocking their claims seem in an era of QAnon and Pizzagate, where baroque conspiracies involving assassinations and paedophilia have crawled out of the weirder depths of the internet and into the relative mainstream. Who would have guessed that Randy and Evi Quaid would set the tone for much of the decade that followed?

Today Quaid has become, and this shouldn’t be surprising, a popular figure on Conspiracy Twitter, where he is currently vocal about corruption in the Democrat Party, the evils of the “radical left” and Donald Trump being a victim of a political witch hunt. That he was tweeting naked pictures of himself with a bunch of bananas over his crotch just two years ago doesn’t appear to have dented his appeal in certain circles. Which is almost admirable, frankly.

Beyoncé’s pregnant belly appears to fold in half, sparking conspiracies that she isn’t actually expecting

In October 2011, Beyoncé sat down in a chair and launched one of the weirdest and still not-entirely-solved mysteries of the decade – was she wearing a fake belly while supposedly pregnant with Blue Ivy? During an otherwise innocuous interview with Australian TV, Beyoncé’s baby bump appeared to fold in half as she bent down, as if a spherical object beneath her dress had collapsed. While it was as unseemly then as it is now to dissect a woman’s pregnant body, the oddness of the image, along with Beyoncé’s slightly sheepish look as she peered up from adjusting herself, gave way to undeniable questions.

Was Beyoncé secretly using a surrogate? Was she wearing a fake bump over the top of a much smaller real bump in order to do a spectacular pregnancy reveal at an awards show two months earlier? Adding further ambiguity to the mystery were the circumstances of Blue Ivy’s eventual birth, with Beyoncé and Jay-Z reportedly paying $1.3 million to block off an entire floor of a Manhattan hospital for the big arrival. And when Beyoncé came to address the rumours in her 2013 HBO special Life Is But a Dream, her pregnant body was displayed in unusually abstract shots – either close-ups of her belly with her head conveniently out of the frame, or a much larger belly displayed in shadow.

Beyoncé reportedly told reporters in 2013 that the rumours weren’t “hurtful” but were “crazy”, adding: “It was fabric that folded! Does fabric not fold? Oh my gosh, so stupid.” But they persisted all the same, even while eventually being overshadowed by far greater scandals in the Knowles household, and music.

They also birthed a slight cottage industry in pop star conspiracies. Much like the Quaids being indirectly responsible for Pizzagate, it’s not hard to identify a causality between Beyoncé’s “fake belly” and Katy Perry secretly being JonBenét Ramsey, or the time the internet insisted Avril Lavigne had died and been replaced by a clone named Melissa. Or that Demi Lovato had a deformed twin sister locked in her basement and named Poot. Remember that?

Kristen Stewart is photographed cheating on Robert Pattinson with her Snow White director

A million hearts shattered in July 2012 when Kristen Stewart, then the lip-chewing star of the Twilight franchise, was caught on camera cheating on her on-screen vampire boyfriend and off-screen non-vampire boyfriend Robert Pattinson in the front seat of a parked car. Even more alarmingly, Stewart was frolicking with Rupert Sanders, the very much married director of her film Snow White and the Huntsman.

The affair marked an almost too-perfect collision of frantic Twihard fandom and the dying days of the celebrity tabloid. As a result, it was subsequently run into the ground, inspiring column inches matched only by the continued woes of Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston.

But what a soap opera it was! From Stewart’s hysterical statement of apology (“This momentary indiscretion has jeopardised the most important thing in my life… Rob – I love him, I love him, I’m so sorry!”) to the $39,000-a-month divorce settlement between Sanders and wife Liberty Ross two years later, it was far and away the most tawdry explosion of cringe in celebrity gossip this decade.

It’s even more surreal when looked at from the vantage point of who Stewart and Pattinson became – both indie-movie darlings far cooler than they were when playing Bella and Edward, and Stewart endlessly photographed with an array of girlfriends on her arm. When photos emerged in July of Stewart reclining on a yacht with a sailor’s cap on her head and kissing model girlfriend Stella Maxwell, it became even more baffling to remember she once risked it all with a pasty Brit filmmaker magnetised to terrible movies.

Reese Witherspoon is arrested after embarking on drunken rant

It broke like a fever dream in April 2013: Reese Witherspoon, the sickeningly sweet star of your mother’s favourite movies, looking downcast and hammered in a mugshot. Even more shocking was the dashcam footage of her arrest, in which the Legally Blonde star is heard claiming she’s pregnant (she wasn’t), proclaiming her Elle Woodsian knowledge of US law (“This is harassment! You're harassing me as an American citizen! I have done nothing against the law!”), and attempting to use her celebrity to get out of her handcuffs (“Do you know my name, sir? … You don’t need to know my name? … OK, you’re about to find out who I am!”)

While Witherspoon apologised days later, saying she was “deeply embarrassed” and admitting that she was “so disrespectful” to her arresting officer, the incident ultimately proved to be an inspirational tale of Hollywood reinvention. Occurring on the heels of a run of cinematic disasters, among them the forgotten flops This Means War and How Do You Know, Witherspoon’s arrest provided her with the kind of edge and controversy that stars can’t typically buy for themselves. In its wake, she would abandon her goody-goody image to play broken, polarising characters in projects including Wild, Big Little Lies and The Morning Show.

All it took was one arrest for disorderly conduct – and very insignificant details like Witherspoon being white, wealthy and married to one of the most powerful agents in Hollywood.

Giving celebrities access to the internet may have been a mistake, exposing their fragilities, ignorance or general vapidity on the regular, as opposed to every once in a while in a magazine interview. Sometimes, however, it provides hilariously bizarre headlines, notably Courtney Love’s brief detour into plane crash investigation.

In March 2014, the Hole frontwoman provided her own solution to the tragedy of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which left its planned flightpath and disappeared off radar over the Indian Ocean, never to be found. “I’m no expert but up close this does look like a plane and an oil slick?” Love asked on Facebook, alongside a screenshot from Tomnod, a crowdsourcing site that allowed users to explore satellite footage in the hunt for the plane.

Asked to elaborate by New York Magazine, Love said: “I saw an article asked people to help search on Tomnod.com so I decided to give it a shot. I figured a plane would still be leaking some fuel so I searched for signs of an oil slick. I found one and there appeared to be an object nearby.”

It went nowhere, experts suggesting the oil slicks stemmed from boats operating nearby. But it did expose a delightful variant on the “Stars – they’re just like us!” trope. Because who hasn’t sat up late into the night trying to solve a famous mystery using Google Images with one hand buried in a bag of Walkers?

556,"In appearance, Trump’s April 6, 2017 missile attack on Syria is the first step towards a regime change, a massive regional conquest, and World War 3. In appearance, the event marked a point of no return for Trump’s presidency.

We have entered uncharted territory, with the future of humanity at stake.

Murder in the name of propaganda

What is clear is that the chemical attack was a false flag operation, staged for war propaganda purposes, with intelligence operatives, the Deep State, the political elite, and the corporate media working in unison.

Syrian jets hit a rebel position. Chemicals used by the rebels (US-backed terrorists, CIA) were stockpiled at the target. The target was hit.

Out of this came the fabricated narrative that President Assad released a chemical weapons attack on civilians, despite the Syrian government having no sane political reason to do so. The Assad regime had recently been given assurances by the Trump administration and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggesting that a regime change was not in the Trump administration’s plans, and that “the Syrian people would decide” Assad’s fate. There was also no sane reason for Russia to have participated in or condoned a chemical weapons attack on civilians.

Syrian-Russian anti-terror operations were succeeding, and Putin was looking forward to cooperation with the new Trump administration.

The White Helmets (left), who play a starring role in the subsequently staged “humanitarian crisis” spectacle, are US/UK-backed terrorist/intelligence assets and propaganda agents.

All signs point to a setup using tired old tricks. A repeat of previous similar staged “humanitarian crisis” pretexts, from the “incubator babies” to “Aleppo Boy”. Elements of the current #SyriaHoax includes clumsy staging of the “chemical attack”, starring a doctor who is a known US-backed terrorist, dead and injured people laughing (because they don’t think the cameras are running), actors playing “dead children” opening their eyes. The Twitter page of a fabricated 7-year old Syrian girl Alabed Bana is ridiculous propaganda that is promoted by major Fake News media, including Jake Tapper of CIA-connected CNN.

As Ron Paul and many others warned, the propaganda must be questioned. According to the sources of former CIA operative Ray McGovern and numerous other current and former intelligence officers, the White House was extensively briefed, and CIA director Mike Pompeo “played it straight”. Trump “knew”, or should have known, “was persuaded”, and ordered the missile strike anyway.

National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary Mattis (image right) pushed for the strike. White House advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump reportedly also pushed for the strike. White House advisor Steve Bannon advised against the strike, and was rebuked.

Who ordered this operation to frame Assad?

Was it the Deep State and corrupt players, and the unhinged warmonger and Al-Qaeda/ISIS favorite John McCain, who visited Syria in February?

Was it to force the Trump administration to act?

Was it the Trump administration itself, setting up a multi-pronged deception?

Was it conducted by other forces or governments (Israel, etc.)?

What did Russia know, if anything? Who benefits?

Trump fired 59 Tomahawk missiles on Shayrat air base. Trump continued entertaining Chinese president Xi Jinping in Palm Beach while the operation unfolded. Nine civilians were killed in the attack and several more were wounded.

Donald Trump committed a mass murder, and is now officially a war criminal. What is also a fact is that the strike and the resulting narrative politically benefits terrorism— ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and the CIA— in opposition to Syria, Russia and their allies, who are fighting terrorism. It was also a glorious moment for the Deep State and the New World Order.

Both Russia and Syria were warned in advance. No Russians lost their lives. Only 23 missiles hit their mark (why and where did the others go?) The damage was “relatively minor”. The runway was left intact. Syrian military planes were able to conduct sorties from the same runway against rebel targets the following morning.

In his statement following the attack, Trump spoke of the “slow and brutal death of beautiful babies, cruelly murdered in a barbaric act”, and declared that there was no question of Assad’s guilt. He left no room even for investigations or questions. Tillerson, former head of Exxon-Mobil (and major player in past wars in which Exxon-Mobil benefited greatly) stated that there will be “no role for (Assad) to govern the Syrian people”, and “there was no doubt Assad was behind the chemical attack”. Defense Secretary Mattis also declared “no doubt” that Assad did it.Trump also stated that his attitude towards Assad “has changed very much” due to the alleged chemical attack. And to further exacerbate tensions, the Pentagon was ordered to begin an investigation into Russia’s role behind the chemical attack.

Was Trump’s attack “real”—or a one-time fake retaliation, in response to a fake chemical attack? Was Trump acting on his own, or was he deceived or forced to order the retaliatory strike? Was Trump naïve and ignorant enough to be manipulated by the Deep State propaganda, and act recklessly out of emotion?

Or was he playing a game?

The world remains confused about the attack and its meaning. Even more baffling is Trump’s apparent total reversal of principle.

According to former State Department counterterrorism coordinator Daniel Benjamin, Trump has

Why did Trump take what appears to be a sudden and unwarranted step towards regime change in Syria, globalism, and World War 3 confrontation with Russia. Why, after having won the presidency for advocating the opposite?

Why this, from the anti-globalist/anti-regime change/anti-corruption choice was (unlike the deeply corrupt neocon-backed war-loving Hillary Clinton and her network) believed to be the president who would start World War 3?

Why this, from someone who knows he won the election because the vast majority of American voters who responded to the message that “Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo”?

Why this, from a man who lambasted the Obama administration for meddling in Syria, and said attacking Syria was a bad idea at least 45 times? Why this, following months of insistence—over the violent opposition of the Deep State, Obama/Clinton Democrats, the Fake News corporate Media and endless “Russiagate” noise— that cooperation with Russia was critical to Middle East stability and world peace? Trump and his administration are now leading the anti-Russia and anti-Putin propaganda effort, launching daily attacks at Putin via the corporate media.

Why this, mere days since Rex Tillerson stated that Assad’s future would be decided by the Syrians, and regime change was not planned?

The missile attack on Syria sparked immediate outrage from the largely anti-war Trump base, which denounced the strikes as a gigantic betrayal.

Most of the leading alternative media voices supporting Trump are, and remain, staunchly anti-war, including Mike Cernovich, Paul Joseph Watson, Stefan Molyneux, Jack Posobiec, Lee Stranahan, and many others. Some are ready to “get off the Trump train”. Even Trump’s blindest followers are going into contortions coming up with rationalizations.

Richard Spencer condemned Trump for his betrayal, and organized an anti-war rally in front of the White House. (This rally was violently attacked by pro-war Soros-funded Antifa thugs.)

Adding to the confusion is the fact that the Trump presidency, despite being embattled, was winning on many fronts. Much had been, up until April 6, moving in his favor.
• The Deep State’s all-out war on Trump was being met with effective pushback from those in the Trump camp. Simultaneously, the Deep State is being fought independently by whistleblowers, including WikiLeaks.
• “Russiagate” is backfiring. Attention has been turned toObama/Democrats illegally spying on Trump and private citizens, leaks, and numerous corruption scandals possibly implicating current and former Democrats and Republicans.
• Investigations into Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, the Obama administration, and the Democratic National Committee remain open and ongoing, with the FBI and the Justice Department sitting on thousands of pieces of incriminating evidence.
• Large numbers of human trafficking and pedophilia arrests are taking place nationwide, under the direction of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, towards the exposure of the larger pedophilia network and political blackmail apparatus that controls much of Washington (Pedogate/Pizzagate).
• The destructive activities of Antifa and anarchist groups funded and controlled by neoliberals and Democrats aligned with Clinton and Obama have failed to turn public opinion against Trump.
• The intelligence-controlledestablishment corporate media aligned against Trump is losing on all fronts to independent and social media sources, and is now derided as Fake News.
• Trump’s presidency is a guiding example inspiring anti-globalist nationalist movements around the world, supported by Nigel Farageand the forces behind Brexit, and nationalists such as Marine Le Pen in France. These movements are gaining momentum.
• Many elements of his Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) agenda are being put into place, despite obstruction and violent opposition by adversaries.
• Most importantly, Trump had been fully supported by his base, through every difficulty.

Does it make any sense for Trump to squander these gains and alienate his vital support base? Why did he suddenly do the one thing that would lead to his demise: an act of war that only a globalist neocon of the highest order would pull off; the one thing that can unite both Left and Right against him?

Why does it seem that Trump is abandoning MAGA altogether?

Why would he toss away an alliance with Russia that would have ensured, if not at least contributed greatly, to a true world peace?

We are left with speculation.

In this interpretation, Trump has given up the fight against globalism. He has “been flipped”. He has sold out. He has surrendered to intimidation from the Deep State.

The Syrian false flag was set up by the Deep State, and Trump was ordered to finish the war of conquest begun with 9/11, or face consequences. He was threatened into doing exactly what Hillary Clinton wants done. Forced to abandon principles. Forced to commit political suicide. Forced to abandon his base, and accept being a politically isolated, impeachable lame duck president. The Trump presidency is left to collapse from both external attack and internal undermining. The Deep State triumphs, and the Bush/Clinton criminal network gets the last laugh.

A variation on the theory: Trump has cut a deal to end the civil war that has grown too damaging, threatening the existence to the system itself. Both the Deep State and Trump prefer to end the fight.

In exchange for the allowing the war to take place, Trump will be lavished with the rewards of all of the corrupt White House puppets who preceded him, as long as he follows orders. If he does a good job, he will be the next ceremonial “war president”. He will get some of his domestic agenda passed, be permitted to live, be treated “normally” by the media, and ride off into the sunset. But MAGA, and the “swamp draining” of Flynn, Bannon, etc. is over.

What appears to be the White House’s sudden“shift to the center” smacks of this capitulation.

Is Trump in danger, is he in control, or is he an isolated dupe?

In explosive new stories broken by Mike Cernovich, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, acolyte of disgraced former CIA Director David Petraeus, has taken over the National Security Council, and is manipulating intelligence reports to Trump and wants 150,000 ground troops in Syria. McMaster is plotting with Petraeus to is purging all who oppose a ground war in Syria.

In this consolidation of power, Trump loyalist K.T. McFarland has been removed. Sebastian Gorka may be next to be removed by McMaster.

McMaster is also close with scandalized former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, and it is reported that Rice herself pushed McMaster to remove Steve Bannon from the NSC. Bannon, who is against regime change, is gone.

Petraeus himself was considered by Trump for the NSC post, following the ouster of Michael Flynn by the Deep State, before McMaster got the job.

In the words of Cernovich, it is now “Trump supporters out, pro-war Petraeus puppets in”.

These disturbing new developments, and the McMaster takeover of foreign policy, come in the wake of months of White House infiltration and sabotage.

Despite continuous warnings of Trump loyalists for the past months, Trump chose to surround himself with enemies and those who seek to undermine his original agenda: Republican/Bush neocons, Obama/Clinton infiltrators (“West Wing Democrats”), Deep State operatives, globalists, Goldman Sachs denizens. He has filled the “swamp” more than he has “drained” it.

In the internal civil war between Trump loyalists and the globalists, the Trump loyalists appear to be losing, leaving Trump isolated and surrounded by seasoned criminals, saboteurs, and spies. National security adviser Flynn, the most powerful operational member of what was the inner circle, was effectively forced to resign, perhaps not coincidentally after spearheading operations against the Deep State. The influence of advisor Steve Bannon, leading force behind the anti-globalist/anti-establishment agenda, has been greatly diminished, and there were rumors that he has considered leaving the White House.

Meanwhile, the influence and power of the CIA/Clinton/Obama/Soros/Goldman Sachs/Israel-connected “West Wing Democrats”–Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Gary Cohn, and Dina Powell is on the rise. Poisonous Bush neocons such as Vice President Mike Pence and Reince Priebus, and the neocon generals, remain securely in place. Trump has shown no signs thathe will fire family members, despite Kushner’s questionable background, and regardless of his leaks of anti-Bannon stories to MSNBC. Hecontinues to praise Priebus, despite evidence of sabotage, and despite thefact that the recently fired Priebus aide Katie Walsh was caught leaking anti-Trump stories to the enemy Fake News media.

Now comes word that the Trump presidency is “reset” towards a “centrist” globalist platform and the end of MAGA; the end of the “deconstruction” and reform efforts represented by Bannon.

According to former CIA operative Robert David Steele, this is Trump’s “Bay of Pigs” moment, in which Trump either reverses course and opposes the Deep State forces pressuring and manipulating him, or he gives in to them—thus rendering himself an immediate lame duck president. This is the moment in which Trump must take on his enemies, at risk to his life. Or not.

Here is the “optimistic” scenario.

Was the missile strike itself a limited one-time staged propaganda deception—a fake response to a fake chemical attack— done with the back channel cooperation of the Russians and Syrians, who were warned in advance? The fact that no Russians were killed, “relatively minor” collateral damage was done, and the runway was left intact all suggest this possibility.

It was a noisy show of military strength and resolve—professional wrestling-style theater—to pave the way for Rex Tillerson’s April 11, 2017 diplomatic trip to Russia, which will focus on the Syrian crisis. It was also a symbolic “shock and awe” gesture , to impress and intimidate visiting Chinese president Xi Jinping, a message to North Korea, and future US-China relations, including tensions in the South China Sea and US-Chinese trade.

The provocative noise is a planetary game of “chicken”—“peace through strength”, “don’t mess with us”—will improve US advantage in negotiations, and ultimately result in future victory. There will be tensions, but no world war. According to Mattis, “tensions with Russia will not spiral out of control”.

This version of events is embraced by Steve Pieczenik, as well as Alex Jones and Roger Stone. Stone does not believe that the limited strike signals the beginning of a wider war. But both Jones and Stone agree that if Trump does widen the war, “he is done”, and Trump “becomes George W. Bush”, and “part of the Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama continuum”.

Numerous other possible “4-D chess” scenarios are put forth by Scott Adams. This is the mythical Trump, keeping allies and foes alike off balance, many steps ahead.

It was also a “wag the dog” distraction, designed to erase Russiagate from news headlines (he has now “proven” that he is not “buddy buddy with Putin”), quell the media, temporarily quell the political opposition, and rally heretofore skeptical world leaders.

Trump also benefits from a “Bush Iraq-9/11 moment”, and becomes a “war president”, avenging an atrocity committed by an evildoer. Even if he loses the support of much of his base, perhaps Trump believes that it can be replaced by new support from those who might warm to him “in a time of war”, against current boogeyman Assad.

Jack Posobiec speculates that Trump and Putin might have cut some sort of back channel deal.

Wikileaks’ Julian Assange wonders that if the end game is that Russia pulls out of Syria, the quagmire will be left for the other nations.

Would Russia to go along with the removal of Assad, along with a carving up of Syria that includes Russia?

Is Trump, in fact, a neocon globalist, in the long line of neocon globalists (Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama/Clinton), who is now casting aside his populism, because it is no longer useful? Is Trump controlled by higher elites?

Has Trump been lying to the Russians and Putin for months about cooperation, while preparing major military moves against them? Has Trump used the Russians to get rid of ISIS elements, while plotting to get rid of the Russians once they stop being useful?

Is Trump, in fact, out to prove that he can outmuscle the “weak” Obama/Clinton globalist agenda, and do them one better, by 1) actually conquering Syria, 2) beat Russia and China, and drive them out of the Middle East, 3) take the Grand Chessboard, and also 4) scare China in compliance? Is this the “peace through strength” total war that Trump and his generals envision?

Trump is also a fervent militarist, who “loves generals” and loves the idea of wielding American military muscle and supremacy. This is evidenced by his incessant fawning overtures to Pentagon and CIA, and surrounding himself with generals and warriors. He is genuinely a fan of the intelligence community and law enforcement. As it probably pains him that any factions within these institutions oppose him, he is eager to win them over.

Trump has never stopped accusing the Obama/Clinton regime of “weakness”. The Trump foreign policy will therefore display“strength”.

Trump must certainly know that war is insanely lucrative, and an economic multiplier that could boost a stagnant US economy. He is pushing a huge increase in military spending.

Who benefits from regime change in Syria? Who benefits from confrontation with Russia and world war 3? None other than the Deep State, the CIA and the New World Order.

There is also the oil. And the pipelines and transit routes.

How could Trump and oil man Tillerson ignore the Grand Chessboard and its spoils?

Judging by the latest provocations, the Trump administration is foaming at the mouth for war:

AP: Senior US official says US has concluded that Russia knew in advance of chemical attack

US forces on Jordanian border, standing by with Jordanian special forces

Trump discussed with king of Jordan Sunni/Kurd coalition to stabilize Syria

Russia warns Trump they will respond with force if Syria red lines crossed again

Boris Johnson spearheads diplomatic drive to get Russian forces out of Syria

UN ambassador Nikki Haley: getting Assad out not only priority in Syria

Tillerson: no role for Assad in Syria

In statements given during April 9 press interviews, Tillerson repeated that defeating the Islamic State remains the top focus, and the strike has “not changed US priorities towards ousting Assad”. Haley repeated declared that regime change in Syria is a priority and “inevitable”. McMaster promised that fighting ISIS and ousting Assad are “simultaneous”, and did not rule out additional strikes.

On every front, severe damage is quickly being done to US-Russian relations, too much to be forgiven or easily reversed. There are few voices of reason, and none from within the Trump administration.

Secretary of State Tillerson makes the Trump administration’s first official trip to Russia on April 11. (If a state of war exists between the US and Russia, would Tillerson be making this trip at all?)

The result of this negotiation could decide the fate of humanity.

But is it smoke and mirrors? Is it all a moot point now?

US military forces are ready. According to Jack Posobiec’s well-placed sources in the military, there will be boots on the ground June 1 or earlier.",conspiracy
237,"The Pizza Connection Trial (in full, United States v. Badalamenti et al.)[1] was a criminal trial against the Sicilian and American mafias that took place in New York City, U.S. The trial centered on a number of independently owned pizza parlor fronts used to distribute drugs, which had imported US$1.65 billion of heroin from Southwest Asia to the United States between 1975 and 1984.[2] The trial lasted from September 30, 1985, to March 2, 1987, ending with 18 convictions, with sentences handed down on June 22, 1987.[2] Lasting about 17 months, it was the longest trial in the judicial history of the United States.[3][4][5][6]

The trial centered on a Mafia-run enterprise that involved processing heroin in Sicily from morphine purchased from Turkey and Southwest Asia, as well as cocaine from South America, for final distribution of the drugs in the United States through independently owned pizza parlor fronts as the money was laundered through several banks and brokerages in the United States and overseas.[7] The enterprise was estimated to have imported US$1.65 billion of heroin to the United States, namely the Northeast and the Midwest, between 1975 and 1984.[2][7]

For about a year, the prosecution, consisting of Richard A. Martin, Louis J. Freeh, Robert Stewart, Robert B. Bucknam and Andrew C. McCarthy, gathered hundreds of witnesses, wiretaps, and thousands of documents, which cost several million dollars to complete.[5] Arrests of conspirators were coordinated in the United States, Italy, Switzerland and Spain on April 8, 1984, following the capture of Gaetano Badalamenti and his son Vito Badalamenti together with Pietro Alfano in Madrid, Spain;[2][8] on November 15, they were extradited to the United States.[9] Badalamenti was formerly on the Sicilian Mafia Commission.[10][11] A day later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested nearly 30 people in New York City, seizing weapons and drugs.[7]

One of these witnesses was Sicilian Mafia pentito Tommaso Buscetta, who had already revealed information to Italian magistrate Giovanni Falcone to prepare for the Maxi Trial, was extradited in December 1984 to the United States where he received a new identity from the government, American citizenship and placed in the Witness Protection Program in exchange for new revelations against the American Mafia in the Pizza Connection Trial.[12][13][3][14]

Another witness was Sicilian Mafia pentito Salvatore Contorno, who followed the example of Buscetta, and began collaborating in October 1984, and also testified at the Maxi Trial.[15][16][17]

Former undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone, who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family between 1976 and 1981 using the alias ""Donnie Brasco"", also testified at the trial.[18]

Out of those arrested, 22 Sicilian-born defendants stood in the trial that began on September 30, 1985:[19][2][7]

Buscetta provided no direct connection between the defendants and drugs.[20] Contorno testified that defendant Frank Castronovo, cousin of Carlo Castronovo in Sicily, used pizza parlors as fronts in the United States.[20] Contorno also testified that he had a meeting in 1980 in Bagheria about heroin and had seen Castronovo there with three other defendants—Salvatore Catalano, Gaetano Mazzara, and Salvatore Greco.[20] Pistone testified that saying he was told that a Bonanno faction headed by Dominick Napolitano had formed an alliance with a Sicilian faction, which involved Salvatore Catalano.[18]

Over the course of the trial, Gaetano Mazzara was murdered and Pietro Alfano was seriously wounded,[21] and on March 2, 1987, two of the 22 men pleaded guilty to lesser currency violations,[7][5][6] while the remaining 18 of the 19 defendants were convicted of running an international ring that distributed tons of drugs.[5][6] Vito Badalamenti was the only defendant acquitted.[22][23] Sentences were handed down on by judge Pierre Leval on June 22, 1987.[21] Five of the defendants were sentenced to 45 years in prison, while the 13 other defendants faced maximum sentences between 15 to 40 years in prison for their convictions on charges of participating in the drug conspiracy.[21] Gaetano Badalamenti was sentenced to 45 years in prison and fined $125,000, and since he was extradited from Spain with the provision that he serve no more more than 30 years, he was ordered to be released after 30 years should he live that long.[23][21] Salvatore Catalano was also was sentenced to 45 years in prison but fined $1.15 million and ordered to pay $1 million in restitution; Salvatore Mazzurco was sentenced to 35 years in prison and fined $50,000 and ordered to pay $500,000 in restitution; Salvatore Lamberti was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined $50,000 and ordered to pay $500,000 in restitution; and Giuseppe Lamberti was sentenced to 35 years in prison and fined $150,000 and ordered to pay $500,000 in restitution.[21]

1294,"Ellen DeGeneres has been continuing her daily syndicated talk show from the comfort of her own home, amid the coronavirus shutdown, which has angered her 'furious' crew amid poor communication regarding their pay.

The Ellen DeGeneres Show's main stage crew, which is comprised of roughly 30 people, received 'no communication' about issues like pay and working hours for over a month, an insider told Variety on Thursday.

To make matters worse, the crew was also 'furious' upon learning that the daytime talk show host hired a non-union tech company to help DeGeneres broadcast daily from her home in California.

Two sources at Ellen's show, speaking to Variety under conditions of anonymity, said that 'higher-ups in production would occasionally answer phone calls but reveal little' about their status.

Crew members finally heard from production executives last week, when they were told to expect a whopping 60% pay decrease, even while the show continues airing.

Meanwhile, Ellen herself is said to have a $77million per year contract for her talk show. Her total net worth is estimated to be a whopping $330million.

Sources added that there are only four of the core crew members who are currently working on the remote version of Ellen, according to Variety.

A spokesperson for Warner Bros. Television made it clear the crew is still getting paid, though they confirmed their hours are reduced.

'Our executive producers and Telepictures are committed to taking care of our staff and crew and have made decisions first and foremost with them in mind.'

Still, insiders speaking to the industry publication claim that for over two weeks, from late March until April 9, the crew were never told how much they would be paid.

During this communication 'blackout,' Ellen expanded her at-home, going from hosting four shows a week to five, all which were shot over a two-day period at her home.

The show typically films four 10-hour work days per week, but the crew was told on April 10 that they should expect to be paid for just two eight-hour days a week.

At the same time, Ellen hired Key Code Media to produce 'technical elements' of the show's new remote production while her crew members with the same skill set were not working.

A rep for the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees union said they were of the crew would continue to be paid, but crew members were told to 'watch closely' for developments.

'Due to social distancing requirements, technical changes in the way the show is produced had to be made to comply with city ordinances and public health protocols,' said a WB spokesperson, while clarifying that no Ellen crew member lost their job because of hiring Key Code.

Crew members also added that what was most upsetting was the, 'lack of personal outreach' from the show's leadership during this unprecedented crisis, according to Variety.

Conversely, the crew also learned that crew members on similar shows were being paid, and treated, much more fairly.

Jimmy Kimmel has reportedly been paying crew members of his Jimmy Kimmel Live show from his own pocket during the COVID-19 outbreak shutdown, and once they returned on air, ABC was paying their full rates.

Sources claimed that crew members on TNT's Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, HBO's Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and Showtime's Desus and Mero were also being paid full rates with transparent communication.

Ellen's been facing her fair share of backlash recently.

The comic was slammed for being tone deaf after cracking a joke that being home all the time during the coronavirus pandemic was akin to being behind bars.

'This is like being in jail,' Ellen told her fans as she sat in a spacious living room with windows opening onto a large plant-filled yard.

'Mostly because I’ve been wearing the same clothes for 10 days and everyone in here is gay,' she quipped.

The response was swift on Twitter.

'Ellen you quarantining in your mansion in designer sweats is nothing like prison,' one Twitter user posted.

Another tweeted: 'What a great look for Ellen as thousands of people sit in actual jail cells just hoping for the best without soap and basic protections.'

Ellen was also recently the subject of a viral Twitter thread calling her 'one of the meanest people alive.'

Comedian Kevin T. Porter kicked the entire social media movement off last month, when he sent out a tweet urging people to message him 'the most insane stories [they've] heard' about DeGeneres in an effort to raise money for the Los Angeles Food Bank.

Shortly after posting, Porter was flooded with written accounts by various Twitter users who claimed to have had less than savory interactions with Ellen over the years.

'Right now we all need a little kindness. You know, like Ellen Degeneres always talks about!,' wrote Porter. '[And] I'll match every [story] w/ $2 to @LAFoodBank.'

Before scanning his Twitter thread for the best responses, Porter reminded his audience that the stories they submit 'have to be real! Cause we need some REAL kindness right now.'

According to one user, former head writer for The Ellen DeGeneres show Karen Kilgariff was 'fired' because she 'wouldn't cross the picket line' during a writer's strike.

'When Karen wouldn't cross the picket line she was fired and Ellen never spoke to her again,' they wrote.

Alleged hostility and mistreatment of writers proved to be a reigning theme in the thread, with one user claiming that her 'friend' who had written for Ellen 'for two years' was never acknowledged by her.

'[She] told me Ellen didn't greet her once. In fact, upon employment, staff were told they weren't allowed to talk to her'

TV writer Benjamin Siemon decided to provide the thread with some stories of his own, that included DeGeneres having an irrationally 'sensitive nose' and often picking 'someone different to really hate' each day on set.

'Everyone must chew gum from a bowl outside her office before talking to her and if she thinks you smell that day you have to go home and shower,' he alleged.

'A new staff member was told 'every day she picks someone different to really hate. It's not your fault, just suck it up for the day and she'll be mean to someone else the next day. They didn't believe it but it ended up being entirely true.'

Comedian Josh Levesque wrote to Porter explaining that a friend of his had worked as a production assistant for The Ellen Show during a time when actor Russell Brand was set to appear as a guest.

Brand allegedly 'came into the employee break area to chat with the crew and hangout,' but then 'Ellen came in and got mad at him.'

Apparently, Ellen told the Get Him To The Greek star that he 'didn't have to interact with these people' and 'that's why guests have their own area backstage.'

Writer Alison Freer recounted a time when she had been working for a production on the Warner Brothers lot - where The Ellen Show is filmed.

'[It] was our showrunner's 50th Bday. Caterer grilling steaks outside for special fancy lunch. Ellen sent someone over to demand they stop, as she doesn't eat meat.'

One user, not speaking from experience, recalled hearing that Ellen had 'insisted' a newly employed assistant take her 'fancy-a** car on a run,' even though the assistant was 'not comfortable' driving the vehicle.

'The assistant accidentally backed it into a pole and was immediately fired for it,' they wrote.

Porter's initial tweet has since garnered more than 5,000 retweets and nearly 1,000 replies, since posting.",mainstream
224,"Did Steve Bannon jump or was he pushed? Bannon’s opponents spoke of a firing, while his allies – and Bannon himself – said he had planned to resign for weeks. Turns out both sides were right. But that is only the start of a tale in which the final chapters are not yet written.

Within hours of leaving his post, Bannon was back as executive chairman of Breitbart. Staff at the right-wing publication, including senior editor Joel Pollak, had already declared “#WAR” on the White House as soon as their boss’s departure was announced.

A Bannon friend said: “Steve’s unchained. Fully unchained.” Another said: “It’s now a Democrat White House”.

At a staff meeting, Bannon refined the blunt declarations. The line that Trump himself would not be attacked was repackaged as a “war for Trump”. That war would be against Trump’s enemies – but not the counter-protesters at Charlottesville or even the “fake media”. The war would be waged on those considered the president’s foes within the White House.

Breitbart has already lined up its first target: national security adviser H R McMaster. The hard right had been set against McMaster since the spring, when he pushed Bannon off a key committee of the National Security Council. Then, with leverage from the appointment of Kelly as chief of staff, McMaster removed four of Bannon’s allies from the council. This tussle led Bannon’s camp to counter-attack on social media, calling for “McMasterOut”.

On the Sunday immediately following Bannon’s departure from the White House, Breitbart led with an article: “HR McMaster Endorsed Book That Advocates Quran-Kissing Apology Ceremonies.” The next day the site was blaming McMaster for Trump’s response to the deaths of ten sailors aboard the USS John McCain in a collision near Singapore. According to the article, McMaster failed to brief the president properly, which is why the commander in chief initially reacted to the news by saying “that’s too bad”.

Bannon and his allies had been whipping up an electronic and social media campaign against McMaster for some time. They tried to rally opposition to a review of Afghanistan policy, with Bannon pushing for a privatisation of the US intervention.

The prelude to the war came after Charlottesville when Bannon supported Trump in his message that both sides were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville — thereby tacitly supporting the white supremacists, even while other advisers warned him against such statements.

Kelly hit back. His allies spread stories that Trump disliked Bannon’s leaking, especially about White House in-fighting, and the books and articles portraying the chief strategist as the power in the executive. Bannon also helped design his own demise – unwittingly or deliberately – by committing “suicide by journalist”. Piqued by a story in The American Prospect about North Korea, he called up the journalist to complain about the government’s approach – which he blamed on generals like McMaster. The enemy, he said, was China in an economic war. He also boasted about his influence, claiming he could have people fired in the government.

The article was quickly presented to Trump. On Friday morning, in a staff meeting, the president said his right-hand ideologue would be leaving that day.

The beginning of the end

The Bannon-Breitbart campaign to vanquish McMaster, and then maybe National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, and then maybe Kelly, and then maybe even Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump will get the publicity accorded to a dramatic story.

Framed as a valiant fight against the “deep state”, it will have its vocal partners. We’ll hear from alt-right polemicist Mike Cernovich, who accused McMaster of manipulating intelligence reports to Trump. We’ll also get insight from “Pizzagate” agitator Jack Posobiec, InfoWars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (“McMaster’s sold out”), and even ex-KKK grand wizard David Duke.

It is unlikely to succeed. The retired generals in the White House have succeeded in containing the machinery around Trump, even if the president cannot be restrained on Twitter. They will have the power of executive agencies behind them. Most of the media will have no desire to aid and abet Bannon. Posobiec may appeal to the wonders of social media and InfoWars but, as Charlottesville showed, the alt-right is discovering that it may not even have a secure position on that battleground.

Still, the campaign will be a most unwelcome flank attack as Trump finds himself surrounded on all sides: the Russia investigation, the failure to pass a single major piece of legislation since January, the questions over ethics and conflicts of interests, the looming deadline for adoption of the federal government’s budget, and the white supremacy spectre.

Once upon a time – even last week – the mantra “Trump still has his base” was being invoked to minimise the threat to the president. Now even that base is fragmenting.

For the occupant of the White House, it is now Total #WAR.",mainstream
508,"“I think I’ve been unnecessarily maligned,” said Mike Cernovich, a right-wing social-media personality who has claimed that every A-list actor in Hollywood is a pedophile. “This shows I’m doing real things, man.” (Cernovich was, in fact, among those who successfully sued to unseal court documents related to Epstein.)

Of course, the notion that the Epstein case somehow validates every outlandish assertion uttered by the tinfoil-hat brigade is absurd. But squint at the recent headlines and you’ll see a story—about abuse of power, and elite impunity, and moral rot in the ruling class—that helps explain why a certain breed of conspiracy theorist has gained so much traction in this political moment.

Fears of systematic, underground child abuse have run through popular conspiracy theories for centuries. One of the oldest anti-Semitic canards held that Jews were murdering Christian children and using their blood to bake matzo. More recently, in the 1980s, America was gripped by the “Satanic panic,” as parents became convinced that their day-care centers were filled with Satanists ritualistically abusing their children. The 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut—which depicts a fictional secret society conducting a cultlike sexual ceremony—spawned fevered speculation about the real-world predation that the director Stanley Kubrick was supposedly trying to expose.

David A. Graham: Arresting Jeffrey Epstein is just the start

Anna Merlan, the author of Republic of Lies, says allegations of pedophilia are central to some of the most widely circulated conspiracy theories on the internet today. She attributes this in part to the simple horror of the crime. “If someone is abusing children, there is no worse thing to be,” Merlan said. Conspiracists tend to weave their narratives in ways that conveniently implicate their political enemies while sparing their allies.

But, Merlan added, “conspiracy theories aren’t based on nothing”—and with every new #MeToo allegation, convictions deepen among the true believers. “Any sort of sexual-abuse scandal that involves powerful people is taken as proof of their basic thesis,” she said. “It’s sort of a sad reality that the world is so full of rape and sexual abuse and predation of women and children that it’s possible to do this.”

For those quasi-professional conspiracy-mongers pushing some version of the “underground pedophile ring” story, the charges against Epstein could prove especially helpful. Seaman, for example, has been reupping requests for Patreon donations in recent days. When I asked him how the fundraising was going, he sounded optimistic. “The Patreon has languished for some time because people were starting to not believe me,” he explained. “They were not seeing any forward movement.” Now? “A lot of people have been Googling us.”

He’s not alone. Mark Fenster, a professor at the University of Florida who has studied the history of conspiracy theories, told me the current prevalence of paranoid thinking across the political spectrum makes this period unusual. Typically, he said, the party that’s out of power is more prone to conspiracy theories. But in the Trump era, everyone—right, left, and center—seems to suspect corrupt machinations at the highest levels of society. And, really, can they be blamed?",mainstream
477,"My first article about K-POP was nine years ago and, since then, things have evolved considerably. K-POP has exploded from its Asiatic market base to take over the music industry worldwide. For instance, in 2018 the group BTS successfully crossed-over to the Western world to become one of the best-selling musical groups in the world. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), BTS represented the second best-selling artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and streaming platforms, coming in second only to Drake. In December 2018, Billboard reported that BTS ranked #8 in their year-end Top Artist Chart and #2 in the Duo/Group ranking, second only to Imagine Dragons. Another confirmation of the group’s “acceptance” into the Western market: BTS will be the musical guests on Saturday Night Live on April 13th alongside Emma Stone.

BTS was formed by Big Hit Entertainment in 2013. Six years later, Big Hit announced the creation of a second K-POP group: Tomorrow X Together – also known as TXT. Consisting of five boys aged between 16 and 19 years old, the group is described as “BTS’ little brother”. Although the group just emerged from the laboratories of Big Hit, it only took days to reached the top of the K-POP world. Why? Connections. To who? The Crown.

On March 5th 2019, TXT was introduced to the public in a media showcase organized by Big Hit. The following day, Spotify chose TXT as the “Early Noise” feature of 2019 – an initiative to identify the next big thing in music. A statement released by Spotify stated:

When the world’s largest streaming service has got your back, you’re doing good. There’s lots of YouTube love as well. At the time of writing these words, the group’s first video Crown amassed over 35 million views in less than ten days. These numbers directly rival those of top Western mainstream artists.

Considering the fact that TXT is a brand new group, does it mean that it’ll be bringing a fresh, new, innovative energy to the music world? Of course not. For instance, take a look at this pic found on Twitter.

During the media showcase, the group was asked about the song creation process. Beomgyu’s answer is short, yet perfectly sums up the group’s reality.

The video Crown sums up another reality of the group: They are owned by the occult elite, which keeps forcing its agenda and symbolism on popular culture – especially towards young people. Here’s a look at it.

The Korean title of the song essentially translates to The Day Horns Grew Out of My Head. Wow, that sounds kind of satanic. But is it, though? Yes, it is.

This is the “official” explanation of the song.

However, through occult symbolism, the video adds another layer to the song which takes on a deeper meaning.

The background and the group’s attire focus on the elite’s trademark colors: Black, white and red. These colors and the dualistic checkerboard pattern are extremely important in occult rituals.

This powerful combination is also used in Monarch mind control.

The lyrics of the first verse describes something an MK slave would say:

Then, they realize that horns are growing on their heads.

In the second verse, the boy meets a guy with wings.

In the chorus on the song, the singers embrace the fact that they have horns on their heads.

The symbol associated with evil and black magic (horns) has turned into a symbol of power (crown). The union between the horned person and the winged person has made them “perfect”. This alludes the occult concept of the union of opposites. The refrain of the song further exemplifies this concept:

Did you know that there’s a mythical figure that has horns, wings and that represents the union of opposites? Its name is Baphomet.

In occult symbolism, Baphomet represents the esoteric forces at work while practicing magic.

Appropriately enough, the song Crown contains several references to magic. During the hook, the group sings:

To most, abracadabra is a silly incantation used in stage magic tricks. However, in occult circles, this phrase is believed to be imbued with actual magical power. Its origins are ancient and mysterious.

The bridge of the song contains another reference to magic.

In the video, the concept of magic is represented by the pentagram – which is also found on the forehead of Baphomet.

With a few simple (yet powerful) words and symbols, the video describes the occult process of the union of opposites to create magic. Considering the fact that the members of TXT did not write any of their song’s lyrics, this profound meaning comes from their puppetmasters. Does the video provide proof of such a claim?

Did you enjoy the video? If so, you can also buy a Baphomet-inspired shirt.

Only days after being introduced to the public in a media event orchestrated by its mother company Big Hit, TXT was launched into the “K-POP stratosphere” (as Spotify puts it). The video Crown is the group’s introduction to the world, a manifesto summing up the beliefs of those who own them.

While this video featuring innocent-faced adolescent boys has a cutesy vibe that is meant to appeal to children and teenagers, its symbolic message is quite dark and profound: It describes the forced exposure of the boys to the dark, evil side of spirituality (horns on the head), an experience that is described as painful in the song’s lyrics. When exposed to “the light”, the group ends up embracing the horns – referring to it as a “crown”.

In some ways, Crown is the group’s “initiation” into the occult elite’s industry. Indeed, to make it big, artists need to “grow horns on their heads” and embrace the deformity forced on them. Furthermore, they must be used to normalize the occult elite’s beliefs and symbolism to the youth in videos that use cute visual techniques to communicate powerful messages.

The main one: Confusing horns on your head for a crown.

709,"A row has broken out after a Margate businesswoman described the town in an online article as having ""drug users, racist cab drivers and grubby kids"".

Thanet councillor Ian Driver said the article was ""rude and arrogant"" and he would raise it with the council.

Lisa Richards, who runs Great British Pizza Company, has not commented to the BBC but has put an apology on Facebook.

Digital magazine Civilian, which published Ms Richards' article, said comments had been taken out of context.

It said the story celebrated the Kent town while acknowledging its issues.

The article began by describing Margate as ""the dumping ground for the unloved, unemployable and uncontrollable"" and referred to ""grubby kids marauding the streets"", ""racist cab drivers and the in-your-face drug use"".

But Ms Richards also said Londoners, treated with ""equal measures of love and scorn"", were seeing past Margate's issues and sensing the ""opportunity and change"" that she and her partner spotted a couple of years ago.

Mr Driver said: ""I don't agree with the rudeness [and] arrogance of that article which is really writing off local people.""

He added: ""I will boycott the restaurant and I'll be encouraging my friends to do [this] until there is a fulsome apology.""

He also said he would raise the issue at a council meeting.

Mark C O'Flaherty, editor of Civilian, said Ms Richards had written a highly personal story about her experiences of moving to Margate and setting up her business.

He said: ""The story is a celebration of the regeneration of the town, while acknowledging the serious ongoing issues that the town faces - including major unemployment problems and recurrently obvious anti-social behaviour.""

And he added: ""The majority of her story is about the hugely encouraging regeneration of the town by both newcomers and long-term residents, and how proud she is to be a part of it.""

Mr O'Flaherty also added Ms Richards was passionately supportive of her community and said: ""We find it particularly unacceptable that a member of Thanet council is calling for a boycott of the premises.""",mainstream
633,"Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine derided President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for national security adviser Thursday for propagating conspiracy theories “a fourth-grader would find incredible.”

Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has come under fire lately for his history of spreading fake news and other conspiracy theories. His son, Michael Flynn Jr., who has served as his father’s chief of staff and was once involved with Trump’s transition, was widely criticized for promoting a false sex-ring conspiracy involving a Washington pizzeria, where a gunman fired at least one shot Sunday during what the gunman told police was a “self-investigation” of the so-called Pizzagate hoax.

For his part, the elder Flynn — who will be tasked with advising the president-elect on the veracity of potential foreign and domestic threats — has also pushed conspiracy theories against Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama.

“Gen. Flynn’s trafficking in conspiracy stories that a fourth-grader would find incredible suggests either that he’s highly gullible or that he’s so consumed with malice that he loses his ability to judge what’s fact and what’s fiction,” Kaine, Clinton’s running mate, told CNN on Thursday.

A group of 53 nonprofit organizations signed a letter Monday asking Trump to dump Flynn, arguing that the retired lieutenant general “is unfit for serving in this critical post” and “[h]is appointment will damage America’s standing in the world and pose a threat to our national security.”

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, urged Trump and Flynn to “disavow these falsehoods and conspiracy theories” like the one Sunday that almost turned deadly.

“They will soon have a country to run, and God help us if they conduct the nation’s affairs like their transition — without the willingness or ability to separate fact from fiction,” he said in a statement.",mainstream
181,"By Monday, a stretch of busy Connecticut Avenue in northwest Washington seemed back to normal, a day after a gunman entered a pizzeria intent on rescuing children trapped in an imaginary sexual abuse ring that Internet conspiracists insist was run by Hillary Clinton and a chief aide.

But it was not back to normal, not with the threat still hanging and no way to brush it aside. The sexual abuse ring is fictional, District of Columbia police said, part of an explosion of made-up news. The danger is real.

“This is a growing national problem — fake news that takes a truly menacing and vitriolic turn, and then fuels this potential for violence,” said Bradley Graham, who with his wife, Lissa Muscatine, owns a popular bookstore down the block from Comet Ping Pong, the restaurant that patrons fled Sunday when a man arrived with an AR-15 assault-style rifle and another weapon.

It is also the latest collision of an information ecosphere careening into unknown territory, the guardrails meant to prevent disaster bent useless by the hatred and animosity of the recently concluded presidential campaign.

Like other fake news, the story has been given credence at the highest levels of the incoming administration. Michael Flynn Jr., the son of Donald Trump’s pick as national security advisor and chief of staff to his father, propelled the unfounded story on Sunday. Weeks ago, his father had promoted another false story that also linked Clinton to sexual abuse.

“Until Pizzagate is proven to be false,” the younger Flynn tweeted Sunday, using the conspiracists’ term for their concoction, “it’ll remain a story.”

Trump transition officials did not reply when asked about the episode.

By the rules of the conspiracists, Clinton and others are guilty of sexually abusing children unless they can prove their innocence.

But how do people prove they are not pedophiles, when those rushing to judgment don’t believe anything the targets say? How do people strip away scandalous rumors from the wild and lawless Internet?

The unfounded accusations against Clinton, campaign chairman John Podesta and the pizzeria’s owner, James Alefantis, had been a concern for weeks. The restaurant’s workers were threatened, and the threats spread to nearby businesses.

For more on politics ... »

On Sunday, store owners lamented that their concerns were not taken seriously enough. That day, police say, Edgar Maddison Welch, a 28-year-old from Salisbury, N.C., strode into Comet Ping Pong with his weapons.

Welch “read online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there,” police said.

He told police “he was armed to help rescue them” and “surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.” No physical injuries were reported.

The genesis of the story was one of Podesta’s purloined emails, which were released by WikiLeaks during the campaign. In it, restaurant owner Alefantis offered to hold a fundraiser for Clinton and asked whether Podesta could attend.

On the Internet, some decided that the everyday words in the email were code for a child sex abuse ring, even if there was no evidence of wrongdoing.

Social scientists say the flurry of rumor-mongering — and, ultimately, Welch’s arrival at the restaurant — stem from a modern culture in which sources of news are no longer trusted and the vacuum has been filled by those spreading falsehoods.

Aram Sinnreich, an associate professor at American University in Washington, likened the Comet pizza accusations to assertions that the Sept. 11 attacks were an inside job and that the mass killings of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 were faked.

“A significant portion of the online population is resistant to traditional methods of establishing what is true and what isn’t,” he said. “That’s a much bigger problem than Pizzagate or any one case. That’s a problem that challenges the mechanisms of a civil society.”

Sinnreich said he is skeptical that there’s any swift way to deal with the disregard for truth or underlying factors, like Americans’ distrust of their leaders. He likened the current environment to a body under siege from new and fearful bacteria.

“There’s no intellectual penicillin out there that will knock the infection out,” he said.

The advent of the Internet, with its hubs of people with myriad interests of fact and fiction, supercharged the ability to spread misinformation, said Karen Kovacs North, a professor of digital social media at USC.

“There have always been and always will be people who question truth or facts,” she said. “It used to be that they could not find like individuals.”

Now, people who share their viewpoint are easier to find than ever, and in many cases it’s from those people that news is received, already salted with “facts” of unknown origin or credibility.

At the White House on Monday, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that such false reports had a “corrosive effect … on our political debate.”

“It’s deeply troubling that some of these false reports could lead to violence,” he said.

On Connecticut Avenue on Monday, five young boys peered into the windows of Comet — “a delicious pizzeria where everyone is welcome!” it bills itself — to see only a few employees inside. Owner Alefantis said in a statement that the restaurant would reopen soon.

“There will be a time and place to address how and why this happened in greater detail,” he said. “For now, I will simply say that we should all condemn the efforts of certain people to spread malicious and utterly false accusations about Comet Ping Pong, a venerated D.C. institution. Let me state unequivocally: These stories are completely and entirely false, and there is no basis in fact to any of them.”

The curious boys walked on. One of them asked a question of an older man accompanying them.

“Conspiracy is an idea that doesn’t hold up,” the man said.

But on Sunday it had held up enough to create fear and chaos, with no solution in sight.

1257,"Trump activists’ super PAC that supported Josh Mandel is shutting down

WASHINGTON -- A super PAC formed by controversial activists who played a role in President Donald Trump’s successful election is shutting down, which means Josh Mandel won’t have its support.

The shuttering of Rev 18, shorthand for “revolution” and 2018, may have little practical effect, however, on the candidacy of Mandel, the single candidate it had so far announced it would independently support. Mandel, Ohio’s state treasurer and a Republican, is mounting a rematch of his 2012 attempt to defeat incumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat.

The PAC formed in late August but its founders by then were known as agitators for their use of social media and incendiary messages. That reputation was burnished by one of the activists, a writer and blogger named Mike Cernovich, when he propagated a false claim that Hillary Clinton was involved in a pedophile ring operating in a pizza shop’s basement.

Another of the founders, Jack Posobiec, was involved in the grassroots group Citizens for Trump (which is also the title of a book he later wrote), helped spread the so-called Pizzagate story and organized the “DeploraBall” to celebrate Trump’s inauguration. The Daily Beast called him “one of the right’s leading agitators and conspiracy theorists.”

And the third partner in the new PAC, Jeffrey Giesea, is an entrepreneur known as an expert on memetic warfare, or the use of jokes, citations and Internet trolling by governments and terrorists to spread propaganda and wage wars of ideas. Giesea helped create the “troll army” that boosted Trump in the election, according to a December article in BuzzFeed.

What the PAC was until today

But the trio is breaking up the PAC. In a Twitter message, they said they have too many other things going on in their lives and the PAC started as a side project and demands more time than they have to give. They said they will refund donations. They said there is no personal animosity among them.

Mandel’s campaign declined to comment, saying it had no ties to the group and its decision was up to its founders.

But the campaign of Brown, the senator the trio would like to see ousted, said the breakup changes nothing. Mandel took the side of Cernovich and Posobiec in a dispute with the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group, when the ADL labeled Cernovich and Posobiec members of the “alt-light” -- a less explicitly racist faction of the loosely affiliated alt-right movement that nevertheless “embraces misogyny and xenophobia.” And Mandel steered clear of renouncing the PAC’s support, said Preston Maddock, Brown’s campaign spokesman.

As individuals, the PAC’s founders “still can use their social media footprint” to support Mandel, Maddock said.

Reached by phone, Posobiec confirmed to cleveland.com that Rev 18 is disbanding but would provide no additional details.

When asked if he still supports Mandel, Posobiec said, “Personally, yes.”

And asked whether he or other members could still use their social media know-how to support candidates, he said absolutely.

“We’re not going anywhere,” Posobiec said.

1309,"The below original text was the basis for Data & Society Founder and President danah boyd’s March 2018 SXSW Edu keynote,“What Hath We Wrought?” — Ed.

Growing up, I took certain truths to be self evident. Democracy is good. War is bad. And of course, all men are created equal.

My mother was a teacher who encouraged me to question everything. But I quickly learned that some questions were taboo. Is democracy inherently good? Is the military ethical? Does God exist?

I loved pushing people’s buttons with these philosophical questions, but they weren’t nearly as existentially destabilizing as the moments in my life in which my experiences didn’t line up with frames that were sacred cows in my community. Police were revered, so my boss didn’t believe me when I told him that cops were forcing me to give them free food, which is why there was food missing. Pastors were moral authorities and so our pastor’s infidelities were not to be discussed, at least not among us youth. Forgiveness is a beautiful thing, but hypocrisy is destabilizing. Nothing can radicalize someone more than feeling like you’re being lied to. Or when the world order you’ve adopted comes crumbling down.

The funny thing about education is that we ask our students to challenge their assumptions. And that process can be enlightening. I will never forget being a teenager and reading “The People’s History of the United States.” The idea that there could be multiple histories, multiple truths blew my mind.Realizing that history is written by the winners shook me to my core. This is the power of education. But the hole that opens up, that invites people to look for new explanations…that hole can be filled in deeply problematic ways.When we ask students to challenge their sacred cows but don’t give them a new framework through which to make sense of the world, others are often there to do it for us.

For the last year, I’ve been struggling with media literacy. I have a deep level of respect for the primary goal. As Renee Hobbs has written, media literacy is the “active inquiry and critical thinking about the messages we receive and create.” The field talks about the development of competencies or skills to help people analyze, evaluate, and even create media. Media literacy is imagined to be empowering, enabling individuals to have agency and giving them the tools to help create a democratic society. But fundamentally, it is a form of critical thinking that asks people to doubt what they see. And that makes me nervous.

Most media literacy proponents tell me that media literacy doesn’t exist in schools. And it’s true that the ideal version that they’re aiming for definitely doesn’t. But I spent a decade in and out of all sorts of schools in the US, where I quickly learned that a perverted version of media literacy does already exist.Students are asked to distinguish between CNN and Fox. Or to identify bias in a news story. When tech is involved, it often comes in the form of “don’t trust Wikipedia; use Google.” We might collectively dismiss these practices as not-media-literacy, but these activities are often couched in those terms.

I’m painfully aware of this, in part because media literacy is regularly proposed as the “solution” to the so-called “fake news” problem. I hear this from funders and journalists, social media companies and elected officials. My colleagues Monica Bulger and Patrick Davison just released a report on media literacy in light of “fake news” given the gaps in current conversations. I don’t know what version of media literacy they’re imagining but I’m pretty certain it’s not the CNN vs Fox News version. Yet, when I drill in, they often argue for the need to combat propaganda, to get students to ask where the money is coming from, to ask who is writing the stories for what purposes, to know how to fact-check, etcetera. And when I push them further, I often hear decidedly liberal narratives. They talk about the Mercers or about InfoWars or about the Russians. They mock “alternative facts.” While I identify as a progressive, I am deeply concerned by how people understand these different conservative phenomena and what they see media literacy as solving.

I get that many progressive communities are panicked about conservative media, but we live in a polarized society and I worry about how people judge those they don’t understand or respect. It also seems to me that the narrow version of media literacy that I hear as the “solution” is supposed to magically solve our political divide. It won’t. More importantly, as I’m watching social media and news media get weaponized, I’m deeply concerned that the well-intended interventions I hear people propose will backfire, because I’m fairly certain that the crass versions of critical thinking already have.

My talk today is intended to interrogate some of the foundations upon which educating people about the media landscape depends. Rather than coming at this from the idealized perspective, I am trying to come at this from the perspective of where good intentions might go awry, especially in a moment in which narrow versions of media literacy and critical thinking are being proposed as the solution to major socio-cultural issues. I want to examine the instability of our current media ecosystem to then return to the question of:what kind of media literacy should we be working towards? So let’s dig in.

In 2017, sociologist Francesca Tripodi was trying to understand how conservative communities made sense of the seemingly contradictory words coming out of the mouth of the US President. Along her path, she encountered people talking about making sense of The Word when referencing his speeches. She began accompanying people in her study to their bible study groups. Then it clicked. Trained on critically interrogating biblical texts, evangelical conservative communities were not taking Trump’s messages as literal text. They were interpreting their meanings using the sameepistemological framework as they approached the bible. Metaphors and constructs matter more than the precision of words.

Why do we value precision in language? I sat down for breakfast with Gillian Tett, a Financial Times journalist and anthropologist. She told me that when she first moved to the States from the UK, she was confounded by our inability to talk about class. She was trying to make sense of what distinguished class in America. In her mind, it wasn’t race. Or education. It came down to what construction of language was respected and valued by whom. People became elite by mastering the language marked as elite. Academics, journalists, corporate executives, traditional politicians: they all master the art of communication. I did too. I will never forget being accused of speaking like an elite by my high school classmates when I returned home after a semester of college. More importantly, although it’s taboo in America to be explicitly condescending towards people on the basis of race or education, there’s no social cost among elites to mock someone for an inability to master language.For using terms like “shithole.”

Linguistic and communications skills are not universally valued. Those who do not define themselves through this skill loathe hearing the never-ending parade of rich and powerful people suggesting that they’re stupid, backwards, and otherwise lesser. Embracing being anti-PC has become a source of pride, a tactic of resistance. Anger boils over as people who reject “the establishment” are happy to watch the elites quiver over their institutions being dismantled. This is why this is a culture war. Everyone believes they are part of the resistance.

But what’s at the root of this cultural war? Cory Doctorow got me thinkingwhen he wrote the following:

Let’s be honest — most of us educators are deeply committed to a way of knowing that is rooted in evidence, reason, and fact. But who gets to decide what constitutes a fact? In philosophy circles, social constructivists challenge basic tenets like fact, truth, reason, and evidence. Yet, it doesn’t take a doctorate of philosophy to challenge the dominant way of constructing knowledge. Heck, 75 years ago, evidence suggesting black people were biologically inferior was regularly used to justify discrimination. And this was called science!

In many Native communities, experience trumps Western science as the key to knowledge. These communities have a different way of understanding topics like weather or climate or medicine. Experience is also used in activist circles as a way of seeking truth and challenging the status quo. Experience-based epistemologies also rely on evidence, but not the kind of evidence that would be recognized or accepted by those in Western scientific communities.

Those whose worldview is rooted in religious faith, particularly Abrahamic religions, draw on different types of information to construct knowledge. Resolving scientific knowledge and faith-based knowledge has never been easy; this tension has countless political and social ramifications. As a result, American society has long danced around this yawning gulf and tried to find solutions that can appease everyone. But you can’t resolve fundamental epistemological differences through compromise.

No matter what worldview or way of knowing someone holds dear, they always believe that they are engaging in critical thinking when developing a sense of what is right and wrong, true and false, honest and deceptive. But much of what they conclude may be more rooted in their way of knowing than any specific source of information.

Right now, the conversation around fact-checking has already devolved to suggest that there’s only one truth. And we have to recognize that there are plenty of students who are taught that there’s only one legitimate way of knowing, one accepted worldview. This is particularly dicey at the collegiate level, where us professors have been taught nothing about how to teach across epistemologies.

Personally, it took me a long time to recognize the limits of my teachers. Like many Americans in less-than-ideal classrooms, I was taught that history was a set of facts to be memorized. When I questioned those facts, I was sent to the principal’s office for disruption. Frustrated and confused, I thought that I was being force-fed information for someone else’s agenda. Now I can recognize that that teacher was simply exhausted, underpaid, and waiting for retirement. But it took me a long time to realize that there was value in history and that history is a powerful tool.

The political scientist Deen Freelon was trying to make sense of the role of critical thinking to address “fake news.” He ended up looking back at a fascinating campaign by Russian Today (known as RT). Their motto for a while was “question more.” They produced a series of advertisements as teasers for their channel. These advertisements were promptly banned in the US and UK, resulting in RT putting up additional ads about how they were banned and getting tremendous mainstream media coverage about being banned. What was so controversial? Here’s an example:

“Just how reliable is the evidence that suggests human activity impacts on climate change? The answer isn’t always clear-cut. And it’s only possible to make a balanced judgement if you are better informed. By challenging the accepted view, we reveal a side of the news that you wouldn’t normally see. Because we believe that the more you question, the more you know.”

If you don’t start from a place where you’re confident that climate change is real, this sounds quite reasonable. Why wouldn’t you want more information? Why shouldn’t you be engaged in critical thinking? Isn’t this what you’re encouraged to do at school? So why is asking this so taboo? And lest you think that this is a moment to be condescending towards climate deniers, let me offer another one of their ads.

“Is terror only committed by terrorists? The answer isn’t always clear-cut. And it’s only possible to make a balanced judgement if you are better informed. By challenging the accepted view, we reveal a side of the news that you wouldn’t normally see. Because we believe that the more you question, the more you know.”

Many progressive activists ask whether or not the US government commits terrorism in other countries. The ads all came down because they were too political, but RT got what they wanted: an effective ad campaign. They didn’t come across as conservative or liberal, but rather a media entity that was “censored” for asking questions. Furthermore, by covering the fact that they were banned, major news media legitimized their frame under the rubric of “free speech.” Under the assumption that everyone should have the right to know and to decide for themselves.

We live in a world now where we equate free speech with the right to be amplified. Does everyone have the right to be amplified? Social media gave us that infrastructure under the false imagination that if we were all gathered in one place, we’d find common ground and eliminate conflict. We’ve seen this logic before. After World War II, the world thought that connecting the globe through financial interdependence would prevent World War III. It’s not clear that this logic will hold.

For better and worse, by connecting the world through social media and allowing anyone to be amplified, information can spread at record speed.There is no true curation or editorial control. The onus is on the public to interpret what they see. To self-investigate. Since we live in a neoliberal society that prioritizes individual agency, we double down on media literacy as the “solution” to misinformation. It’s up to each of us as individuals to decide for ourselves whether or not what we’re getting is true.

Yet, if you talk with someone who has posted clear, unquestionable misinformation, more often than not, they know it’s bullshit. Or they don’t care whether or not it’s true. Why do they post it then? Because they’re making a statement. The people who posted this meme (figure 1) didn’t bother to fact check this claim. They didn’t care. What they wanted to signal loud and clear is that they hated Hillary Clinton. And that message was indeed heard loud and clear. As a result, they are very offended if you tell them that they’ve been duped by Russians into spreading propaganda. They don’t believe you for one second.

Misinformation is contextual. Most people believe that people they know are gullible to false information, but that they themselves are equipped to separate the wheat from the chaff. There’s widespread sentiment that we can fact check and moderate our way out of this conundrum. This will fail. Don’t forget that for many people in this country, both education and the media are seen as the enemy — two institutions who are trying to have power over how people think. Two institutions that are trying to assert authority over epistemology.

Growing up on Usenet, Godwin’s Law was more than an adage to me. I spent countless nights lured into conversation by the idea that someone was wrong on the internet. And I long ago lost count about how many of them ended up with someone invoking Hitler or the Holocaust. I might have even been to blame in some of these conversations.

Fast forward 15 years to the point when Nathan Poe wrote a poignant comment on an online forum dedicated to Christianity: “Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won’t mistake for the genuine article.”Poe’s Law, as it became known, signals that it’s hard to tell the difference between an extreme view and a parody of an extreme view on the internet.

In their book, “The Ambivalent Internet,”media studies scholars Whitney Phillips and Ryan Milner highlight how a segment of society has become so well-versed at digital communications — memes, GIFs, videos, etc. — that they can use these tools of expression to fundamentally destabilize others’communication structures and worldviews. It’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s fiction, what’s cruel and what’s a joke. But that’s the point. That is howirony and ambiguity can be weaponized. And for some, the goal is simple:dismantle the very foundations of elite epistemological structures that are so deeply rooted in fact and evidence.

Many people, especially young people, turn to online communities to make sense of the world around them. They want to ask uncomfortable questions, interrogate assumptions, and poke holes at things they’ve heard. Welcome to youth. There are some questions that are unacceptable to ask in public and they’ve learned that. But in many online fora, no question or intellectual exploration is seen as unacceptable. To restrict the freedom of thought is to censor. And so all sorts of communities have popped up for people to explore questions of race and gender and other topics in the most extreme ways possible. And these communities have become slippery. Are those taking on such hateful views real? Or are they being ironic?

In the 1999 film The Matrix, Morpheus says to Neo: “You take the blue pill,the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.” Most youth aren’t interested in having the wool pulled over their head, even if blind faith might be a very calming way of living. Restricted in mobility and stressed to holy hell, they want to have access to what’s inaccessible, know what’s taboo, and say what’s politically incorrect. So who wouldn’t want to take the red pill?

In some online communities, taking the red pill refers to the idea of waking up to how education and media are designed to deceive you into progressive propaganda. In these environments, visitors are asked to question more. They’re invited to rid themselves of their politically correct shackles. There’s an entire online university designed to undo accepted ideas about diversity, climate, and history. Some communities are even more extreme in their agenda. These are all meant to fill in the gaps for those who are opening to questioning what they’ve been taught.

In 2012, it was hard not to avoid the names Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman, but that didn’t mean that most people understood the storyline.In South Carolina, a white teenager who wasn’t interested in the news felt like he needed to know what the fuss was all about. He decided to go to Wikipedia to understand more. He was left with the impression that Zimmerman was clearly in the right and disgusted that everyone was defending Martin. While reading up on this case, he ran across the term “black on white crime” on Wikipedia and decided to throw that term into Google where he encountered a deeply racist website inviting him to wake up to a reality that he had never considered. He took that red pill and dove deep into a worldview whose theory of power positioned white people as victims. Over a matter of years, he began to embrace those views, to be radicalized towards extreme thinking. On June 17, 2015, he sat down for an hour with a group of African-American church-goers in Charleston South Carolina before opening fire on them, killing 9 and injuring 1. His goal was simple: he wanted to start a race war.

It’s easy to say that this domestic terrorist was insane or irrational, but he began his exploration trying to critically interrogate the media coverage of a story he didn’t understand. That led him to online fora filled with people who have spent decades working to indoctrinate people into a deeply troubling, racist worldview. They draw on countless amounts of “evidence,” engage in deeply persuasive discursive practices, and have the mechanisms to challenge countless assumptions. The difference between what is deemed missionary work, education, and radicalization depends a lot on your worldview. And your understanding of power.

Who Do You Trust?

The majority of Americans do not trust the news media. There are many explanations for this — loss of local news, financial incentives, hard to distinguish between opinion and reporting, etc. But what does it mean to encourage people to be critical of the media’s narratives when they are already predisposed against the news media?

Perhaps you want to encourage people to think critically about how information is constructed, who is paying for it, and what is being left out. Yet, among those whose prior is to not trust a news media institution, among those who see CNN and The New York Times as “fake news,” they’re already there. They’re looking for flaws. It’s not hard to find them. After all, the news industry is made of people in institutions in a society. So when youth are encouraged to be critical of the news media, they come away thinking that the media is lying. Depending on someone’s prior, they may even take what they learn to be proof that the media is in on the conspiracy. That’s where things get very dicey.

Many of my digital media and learning colleagues encourage people to make media to help understand how information is produced. Realistically, many young people have learned these skills outside the classroom as they seek to represent themselves on Instagram, get their friends excited about a meme, or gain followers on YouTube. Many are quite skilled at using media, but to what end? Every day, I watch teenagers produce anti-Semitic and misogynistic content using the same tools that activists use to combat prejudice. It’s notable that many of those who are espousing extreme viewpoints are extraordinarily skilled at using media. Today’s neo-Nazis are a digital propaganda machine. Developing media making skills doesn’t guarantee that someone will use them for good. This is the hard part.

Most of my peers think that if more people are skilled and more people are asking hard questions, goodness will see the light. In talking about misunderstandings of the First Amendment, Nabiha Syed of Buzzfeedhighlights that the frame of the “marketplace of ideas” sounds great, but is extremely naive. Doubling down on investing in individuals as a solution to a systemic abuse of power is very American. But the best ideas don’t always surface to the top. Nervously, many of us tracking manipulation of media are starting to think that adversarial messages are far more likely to surface than well-intended ones.

This is not to say that we shouldn’t try to educate people. Or that producing critical thinkers is inherently a bad thing. I don’t want a world full of sheeple.But I also don’t want to naively assume what media literacy could do in responding to a culture war that is already underway. I want us to grapple with reality, not just the ideals that we imagine we could maybe one day build.

It’s one thing to talk about interrogating assumptions when a person can keep emotional distance from the object of study. It’s an entirely different thing to talk about these issues when the very act of asking questions is what’s being weaponized. This isn’t historical propaganda distributed through mass media. Or an exercise in understanding state power. This is about making sense of an information landscape where the very tools that people use to make sense of the world around them have been strategically perverted by other people who believe themselves to be resisting the same powerful actors that we normally seek to critique.

Take a look at the graph above. Can you guess what search term this is? This is the search query for “crisis actors.” This concept emerged as a conspiracy theory after Sandy Hook. Online communities worked hard to get this to land with the major news media after each shooting. With Parkland, they finally succeeded. Every major news outlet is now talking about crisis actors, as though it’s a real thing, or something to be debunked. When teenage witnesses of the mass shooting in Parkland speak to journalists these days, they have to now say that they are not crisis actors. They must negate a conspiracy theory that was created to dismiss them. A conspiracy theory that undermines their message from the get-go. And because of this, many people have turned to Google and Bing to ask what a crisis actor is. They quickly get to the Snopes page. Snopes provides a clear explanation of why this is a conspiracy. But you are now asked to not think of an elephant.

You may just dismiss this as craziness, but getting this narrative into the media was designed to help radicalize more people. Some number of people will keep researching, trying to understand what the fuss is all about. They’ll find online fora discussing the images of a brunette woman and ask themselves if it might be the same person. They will try to understand the fight between David Hogg and Infowars or question why Infowars is being restricted by YouTube. They may think this is censorship. Seeds of doubt will start to form. And they’ll ask whether or not any of the articulate people they see on TV might actually be crisis actors. That’s the power of weaponized narratives.

One of the main goals for those who are trying to manipulate media is to pervert the public’s thinking. It’s called gaslighting. Do you trust what is real?One of the best ways to gaslight the public is to troll the media. By getting the news media to be forced into negating frames, they can rely on the fact that people who distrust the media often respond by self-investigating. This is the power of the boomerang effect. And it has a history. After all, the CDC realized that the more news media negated the connection between autism and vaccination, the more the public believed there was something real there.

In 2016, I watched networks of online participants test this theory through an incident now known as Pizzagate. They worked hard to get the news media to negate the conspiracy theory, believing that this would prompt more people to try to research if there was something real there. They were effective. The news media covered the story to negate it. Lots of people decided to self-investigate. One guy even showed up with a gun.

Still from the trailer for “ Gaslight

The term “gaslighting” originates in the context of domestic violence. The term refers back to an 1944 movie called Gas Light where a woman is manipulated by her husband in a way that leaves her thinking she’s crazy. It’sa very effective technique of control. It makes someone submissive and disoriented, unable to respond to a relationship productively. While many anti-domestic violence activists argue that the first step is to understand that gaslighting exists, the “solution” is not to fight back against the person doing the gaslighting. Instead, it’s to get out. Furthermore, anti-domestic violence experts argue that recovery from gaslighting is a long and arduous process, requiring therapy. They recognize that once instilled, self-doubt is hard to overcome.

And unlike the domestic violence context, there is no “getting out” that is really possible in a media ecosystem. Sure, we can talk about going off the grid and opting out of social media and news media, but c’mon now.

In 2017, Netflix released a show called 13 Reasons Why. Before parents and educators had even heard of the darn show, millions of teenagers had watched it. For most viewers, it was a fascinating show. The storyline was enticing, the acting was phenomenal. But I’m on the board of Crisis Text Line, an amazing service where people around this country talk with trained counselors via text message when they’re in a crisis. Before the news media even began talking about the show, we started to see the impact. After all, the premise of the show is that a teen girl died by suicide and left behind 13 tapes explaining how people had bullied her to justify her decision.

At Crisis Text Line, we do active rescues every night. This means that we send emergency personnel to the homes of someone who is in the middle of a suicide attempt in an effort to save their lives. Sometimes, we succeed. Sometimes, we don’t. It’s heartbreaking work. As word of 13 Reasons Why got out and people started watching the show, our numbers went through the roof. We were drowning in young people referencing the show, signaling how it had given them a framework for ending their lives. We panicked. All hands on deck. As we got things under control, I got angry. What the hell was Netflix thinking?

Researchers know the data on suicide and media. The more the media normalizes suicide, the more suicide is put into people’s head as a possibility,the more people who are on the edge start to take it seriously and consider it for themselves. After early media effects research was published, journalists developed best practices to minimize their coverage of suicide. As Joan Donovan often discusses, this form of “strategic silence” was viable in earlier media landscapes; it’s a lot harder now. Today, journalists and media makers feel as though the fact that anyone could talk about suicide on the internet means that they should have a right to do so too.

We know that you can’t combat depression through rational discourse.Addressing depression is hard work. And I’m deeply concerned that we don’t have the foggiest clue how to approach the media landscape today. I’m confident that giving grounded people tools to think smarter can be effective.But I’m not convinced that we know how to educate people who do not share our epistemological frame. I’m not convinced that we know how to undo gaslighting. I’m not convinced that we understand how engaging people about the media intersects with those struggling with mental health issues.And I’m not convinced that we’ve even begun to think about the unintended consequences of our good — let alone naive — intentions.

In other words, I think that there are a lot of assumptions baked into how we approach educating people about sensitive issues and our current media crisis has made those painfully visible.

Oh, and by the way, the Netflix TV show ends by setting up Season 2 to start with a school shooting. WTF, Netflix?

So what role do educators play in grappling with the contemporary media landscape? What kind of media literacy makes sense? To be honest, I don’t know. But it’s unfair to end a talk like this without offering some path forward so I’m going to make an educated guess.

That’s really tricky because most people like to follow their gut more than than their mind. No one wants to hear that they’re being tricked. Still, I thinkthere might be some value in helping people understand their own psychology.

Consider the power of nightly news and talk radio personalities. If you bring Sean Hannity, Rachel Maddow, or any other host into your home every night,you start to appreciate how they think. You may not agree with them, but youbuild a cognitive model of their words such that they have a coherent logic to them. They become real to you, even if they don’t know who you are. This is what scholars call “parasocial interaction.” And the funny thing about humanpsychology is that we trust people who we invest our energies into understanding. That’s why bridging difference requires humanizing people across viewpoints.

Empathy is a powerful emotion, one that most educators want to encourage.But when you start to empathize with worldviews that are toxic, it’s very hard to stay grounded. It requires deep cognitive strength. Scholars who spend a lot of time trying to understand dangerous worldviews work hard to keep their emotional distance. One very basic tactic is to separate the different signals. Just read the text rather than consume the multimedia presentation of that. Narrow the scope. Actively taking things out of context can be helpful for analysis precisely because it creates a cognitive disconnect. This is the opposite of how most people encourage everyday analysis of media, where the goal is to appreciate the context first. Of course, the trick here is wanting to keep that emotional distance. Most people aren’t looking for that.

I also believe that it’s important to help students truly appreciate epistemological differences. In other words, why do people from different worldviews interpret the same piece of content differently? Rather than thinking about the intention behind the production, let’s analyze the contradictions in the interpretation. This requires developing a strong sense of how others think and where the differences in perspective lie. From an educational point of view, this means building the capacity to truly hear and embrace someone else’s perspective and teaching people to understand another’s view while also holding their view firm. It’s hard work, an extension of empathy into a practice that is common among ethnographers. It’s also a skill that is honed in many debate clubs. The goal is to understand the multiple ways of making sense of the world and use that to interpret media.Of course, appreciating the view of someone who is deeply toxic isn’t always psychologically stabilizing.

Another thing I recommend is to help students see how they fill in gaps when the information presented to them is sparse and how hard it is to overcome priors. Conversations about confirmation bias are important here because it’s important to understand what information we accept and what information we reject. Selective attention is another tool, most famously shown to students through the “gorilla experiment.” If you aren’t familiar with this experiment, it involves showing a basketball video and focusing on counting passes made by people in one color shirt and then asking if they saw the gorilla. Many people do not. Inverting these cognitive science exercises,asking students to consider different fan fiction that fills in the gaps of a story with divergent explanations is another way to train someone to recognize how their brain fills in gaps.

What’s common about the different approaches I’m suggesting is that they are designed to be cognitive strengthening exercises, to help students recognize their own fault lines, not the fault lines of the media landscape around them. I can imagine that this too could be called media literacy and if you want to bend your definition that way, I’ll accept it. But the key is to realize the humanity in ourselves and in others. We cannot and should not assert authority over epistemology, but we can encourage our students to be more aware of how interpretation is socially constructed. And to understand how that can be manipulated. Of course, just because you know you’re being manipulated doesn’t mean that you can resist it. And that’s where my proposal starts to get shaky.

Let’s be honest — our information landscape is going to get more and more complex. Educators have a critical role to play in helping individuals and societies navigate what we encounter. But the path forward isn’t about doubling down on what constitutes a fact or teaching people to assess sources.Rebuilding trust in institutions and information intermediaries is important, but we can’t assume the answer is teaching students to rely on those signals.The first wave of media literacy was responding to propaganda in a mass media context. We live in a world of networks now. We need to understand how those networks are intertwined and how information that spreads through dyadic — even if asymmetric — encounters is understood and experienced differently than that which is produced and disseminated through mass media.

Above all, we need to recognize that information can, is, and will be weaponized in new ways. Today’s propagandist messages are no longer simply created by Madison Avenue or Edward Bernays-style State campaigns. For the last 15 years, a cohort of young people has learned how to hack the attention economy in an effort to have power and status in this new information ecosystem. These aren’t just any youth. They are young people who are disenfranchised, who feel as though the information they’re getting isn’t fulfilling, who struggle to feel powerful. They are trying to make sense of an unstable world and trying to respond to it in a way that is personally fulfilling.Most youth are engaged in invigorating activities. Others are doing the same things youth have always done. But there are youth out there who feel alienated and disenfranchised, who distrust the system and want to see it all come down. Sometimes, this frustration leads to productive ends. Often it does not. But until we start understanding their response to our media society, we will not be able to produce responsible interventions. So I would argue that we need to start developing a networked response to this networked landscape. And it starts by understanding different ways of constructing knowledge.",mainstream
1133,"Comet Ping Pong, the DC pizzeria at the center of the pizzagate fake news conspiracy theory. Getty Images

Police arrested 28-year-old North Carolina man Edgar Maddison Welch on Sunday after he walked into a crowded Washington, D.C. pizzeria armed with an assault weapon and fired one or more shots, D.C. police said according to the Washington Post.

Though there were no reported injuries, the incident sparked a firestorm when it was reported that Welch's motivation for firing shots in the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria was a fake news story, now dubbed ""Pizzagate.""

The fake ""Pizzagate"" story alleged that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign chair John Podesta were using the pizzeria as the base for a child trafficking ring.

The story originated on 4chan and in a Reddit thread, where commenters made a number of unsubstantiated and false claims to tie Clinton and her staff to the non-existent pedophilia ring.

Some the claims made in the Reddit thread included that the restaurant's menu contains a symbol of pedophilia, which turned out to be a set of ping pong paddles; frequent mentions of pizza in Podesta's leaked e-mails; and that the pizzeria owner, James Alefantis, has a name that sounds like the French translation of ""I love children.""

Proponents of the conspiracy theory also cited other bizarre and patently false ""evidence,"" like a collage made up of unrelated Instagram pictures of people allegedly involved in the scandal; supposedly coded signals for pedophiles like the phrase ""play, eat, drink"" on Comet Ping Pong's menu, which spells P.E.D when abbreviated; and an elaborate system of underground tunnels linking the pizzeria to other venues in the surrounding area.

Welch, the man police say opened fire in the pizzeria on Sunday, told police that he had gone to Comet Ping Pong to ""self-investigate"" the fake news story.

Alefantis said the pizzeria would remain open in a statement late Sunday. ""I hope that those involved in fanning these flames will take a moment to contemplate what happened here today, and stop promoting these falsehoods right away,"" he said.

Michael Flynn Jr., the son of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Donald Trump's national security advisor, tweeted about ""Pizzagate"" Sunday night:

Flynn Jr's tweet prompted a Twitter feud with CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who began to direct message him, saying, ""Michael — the police called pizza gate a fictitious conspiracy theory tonight. Does someone have to die before you take this s--- seriously. Spreading this nonsense is dangerous.""

When Flynn Jr. replied that he wanted the news story to be false, Tapper shot back, ""It is a f------ pizzeria. Show me what you're talking about that proves a satanic pedophilia cult. Your tweet is wildly irresponsible. Listen to me. You are going to get someone killed. Maybe an innocent child. For what??????""",mainstream
949,"A North Carolina man who was arrested on Sunday after he fired a gun inside a Washington, D.C. restaurant because he believed a false conspiracy theory claiming the pizzeria was harboring a child sex abuse ring run by Hillary Clinton now says he “regret[s] how I handled the situation.”

Edgar Welch, 28, gave an interview to the New York Times this week via videoconference as he sat in D.C. jail. He told the Times he originally planned to just take a “closer look” at the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, but changed his plans when he arrived, ultimately firing a military-style assault rifle inside the restaurant.

Comet Ping Pong has been swept up in a frenzy of false conspiracy theories about Clinton for weeks. The online conspiracies began after James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, was mentioned in Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s emails. Articles posted on Facebook and fake news websites claimed Alefantis’s restaurant was the center of a child kidnapping and sex trafficking operation — despite the fact that none of this was true.

Welch told the Times that reading several sources gave him the “impression something nefarious was happening” at the restaurant. He said he knew “the intel on this wasn’t 100 percent,” but discovering there was no pedophile ring at Comet Ping Pong did not lead him to dismiss completely the claims he’d been reading.",mainstream
1086,"Every Republican and Independent in Alabama Ought to Support Roy Moore

Is this why Roy Moore is under fire? The politics of personal destruction in the US of A has always relied on sex crimes or sexual perversions . When Deep State wanted Bill Clinton to fall in line, the sprung Monica Lewinsky on him. Whenever the shadow government wants to terminate a politician’s career they smear him or her with any innuendo of sexual wrongdoing that will stick. It’s been done like this practically forever in America because of the puritan values that still exist. The country is now witnessing one Mainstream Media hit piece after another targeting U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore. Deep State has given the orders to take Moore down—hard! This entire psyop has been carefully planned by the U.S. Intelligence Community ever since Moore entered the senate race. The decision-makers know that a shift in the balance of power there can make President Trump’s much more miserable. Hence, they have implemented a strategy that is well known in Chicagoland as the Rules for Radicals. What U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore is experiencing right now is the outworking of Saul Alinsky’s communist playbook Rules for Radicals. This manual for grassroots revolution — right or wrong — has 13 “Rules for Radicals”. It’s rule #13 that is being used with great effect to take down Roy Moore. 13. “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.”

 Cut off the support network and isolate the target from

 sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt

 faster than institutions. 

 (Source: The Left’s playbook: Satanist Saul Alinsky’s 13 rules for political warfare) This is exactly Roy Moore’s plight at this very moment. The Left has swung into action at the ‘perfect’ time to sabotage Moore’s candidacy in Alabama. They did the very same thing to Candidate Donald Trump in October of 2016. They also smeared Presidential Candidate Herman Cain in a similar way in December of 2011. They tried to do it to Ben Carson and many others on the Right who pose a formidable political profile. Both the Left and the Right have implemented #13 — upon the orders of Deep State — for many decades. They will blacken the reputation of any opponent with sexual misconduct when they want to take someone down … for good. What is absolutely critical to understand is that Deep State wants Roy Moore out of this race. What he represents is anathema to the treasonous cabal of RINOs who currently predominate throughout the U.S. Congress. Moore poses a very real threat to their little uni-party. Those who populate The Swamp know that Moore will not go along to get along. That he will ally himself with Trump. And that he will advance the populist agenda however he can. He is, after all, a Christian and a conservative as well as a patriot and a nationalist. The most crucial aspect of this sordid saga is that it is the Left that reeks with criminal guilt for the Washington, D.C. scandal known as Pizzagate. The Clinton’s, the Podesta’s, the Obama’s, the Biden’s, et al. are so deep in Pizzagate it’s a wonder they are still not locked up. PIZZAGATE: The Scandal That Will Take Down the Clintons, the Democratic Party and the U.S. Federal Government As a matter of historical fact, the Democrats are quite naturally into sexual perversions and carnal deviance. It’s just what they do and what liberalism encourages. Extreme promiscuity and overly permissive mores are the status quo on the Left. That’s not to say that the Republicans are not equally as guilty in their own way as well. Because the politics of personal destruction has always served the Left well, especially where it concerns sexual wrongdoing, they use it as their preferred weapon. It almost always works for them, as the nation is now seeing with Roy Moore. The key point here is that those accusing Roy Moore of basically nothing are themselves culpable of the most heinous crimes against children—very young children. Pizzagate has already shown the American people just how morally depraved and criminally reckless the accusers really are. PIZZAGATE: A Special Report on the Washington, D.C. Pedophilia Scandal 

 This is what makes this whole witch hunt so despicable. All of the accusers in this case are up to their eyeballs in Pedogate. That’s because it is the very mechanism by which the political class has been controlled and coerced over decades. Deep State would have it no other way. However, that’s all about to change. PEDOGATE: Pandora’s Box Has Been Opened for Deep State and the C.I.A. KEY POINT:“It has been a Clinton MO for decades to accuse their enemies of exactly what they themselves are guilty of. This allowed them in the past to always be on the offensive, and rarely on the defensive, even when they are guilty of so much hardcore criminal activity.”[1] Let’s take a close look at the historical record. As Arkansas’ Attorney General, then Governor and as POTUS, Bill Clinton has a past so fraught with sex crimes it boggles the mind. In each and every case, the MSM literally jumped through hoops of fire to cover up Clinton’s criminal activity. Past employees of the LRPD in Little Rock, Arkansas and Pulaski County Sheriff have gone on the record over the years with evidence of a Bill Clinton crime spree so extensive that it defies credulity. Were the country to be provided with an accurate list of all Bill Clinton’s sexual exploits, it would read like a sex crime thriller. The rapes and groping and propositions that we do know about all occurred when Bill was in high office. Yet the MSM either didn’t report these crimes, or treated them as “he said, she said” rumors. The testimony offered by his victims is so compelling that Clinton would undoubtedly be tried for felonious conduct today, just like Harvey Weinstein. The crucial point here is that Deep State has always worked triple time to hide both sex crimes and sexual indiscretions of it various high-level agents such as Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Podesta, Joe Biden, as well as many other Democrats whose criminal activity never made it to the front pages. Then there are the many VIP supporters and dependable donors of the Democratic Party who were also protected for decades in spite of so much known sexual abuse and crimes in their background. The most glaring examples are Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein, Brett Ratner, Jann Wenner, Mark Halperin and Kevin Spacey. As follows: Spacey is a Democratic donor and a friend of President Bill Clinton. Having met the former U.S. President before his presidency began, Spacey once described Clinton as “one of a shining light” in the political process. He additionally made a cameo appearance in the short film President Clinton: Final Days, a light-hearted political satire produced by the Clinton administration for the White House Correspondents Dinner.[2] The following link contains a graphic which portrays a “Who’s Who” of today’s Democratic luminaries throughout Hollywood whose acts of sexual harassment and abuse have been exposed. What do these now famous sexual predators have in common? Lastly, just look at how long it took for the MSM to report the truth about, and the authorities to lock up, serial sex offender Antony Weiner. Given this true state of affairs, it’s imperative that the good people of Alabama do not let the treacherous agents of Deep State influence their vote. These globalists at heart have no interest whatsoever in the welfare of the American Republic. On the contrary, they seek it complete and final destruction. The election of Roy Moore may provide the political bulwark necessary to stop the many seditious plots being hatched by traitors in the Congress. Does the body politic comprehend just how dire this situation really is, particularly the voters in Alabama?! Simple point of fact: It’s quite unlikely that Roy Moore would have ever run for such a high-profile senate seat if he was actually guilty of any transgressions against young women. Did he date them? Who cares? It’s his business. Many adult men date much younger women. Regardless of what the truth is it appears that Roy Moore has well outgrown that day and time. Furthermore, a close review of all the most one-sided evidence presented thus far by the biased MSM does not reveal a single actionable crime. Most importantly, Moore certainly did not do many high-ranking Democrats do every day of every week for years on end.

TWELVE ALABAMA WOMEN AFFIRM THE GOOD NAME OF JUDGE ROY MOORE

This evening, the Judge Roy Moore Campaign for U.S. Senate released the statements of twelve women who are coming forward as character witnesses for Roy Moore.

Here are their statements:

 “I have known Roy Moore for about forty years. Roy and I briefly dated when I was in my twenties. While I was around Roy, either just the two of us or with other people, he was always a true gentleman treating me with respect and courtesy. I can honestly say that I never have seen or heard any inappropriate remarks or behaviors while he was around me. I believe that Roy lives by his Christian beliefs and is a good man. – Jennie Klingenbeck, Birmingham, AL (previously Gadsden, Alabama).

My name is Jaime Moses and I was born and raised in Gadsden, Alabama. I worked at Uncle Sam’s BBQ (closed now) for 10 years while in my 20’s and waited on Roy Moore and his family. Mr. Moore and his wife were nothing but friendly and respectful. The children were the same, which is a sign of great parenting. He knew many people dining there and spoke and shook hands with everyone. Not once did he make me feel uncomfortable. Working in the food industry can be hard sometimes and Mr. Moore’s kindness to myself and staff did not go unnoticed. – Jaime Moses, native of Gadsden, Alabama.

“My first remembrance of Roy Moore was grammar school. He was probably in Jr High school but all of us Gallant kids rode the same bus. He was always a gentle, kind boy and grew into an even more admirable man. He was my softball coach in my high school days and was always such a kind person, never a mean or hateful word to any of us. Only kindness and utmost respect! Have been friends with all of his family for many, many years. NEVER heard ANY mention of any such behavior in all these years. Have seen him at the local church several times with his knees bowed in prayer at the altar. Takes time to listen to people. Just a wonderful, Christian man in a small rural community. Devoted to family, friends and most of all God. Proud to know him and will continue to support him with our presence and prayers.”

 – Sharon Lamkin, Gallant, Alabama

“I have known Roy for over 30 years. I met him in 1984 when he met my sister in church and began dating her. He has always showed honor and dignity. I truly can’t even begin to grasp that people would question his character. He has lived by what he preached since the day I met him.” – Kandi Kisor Smith, sister of Kayla Moore.

​”​I was the receptionist for Roy Moore the first time he was Chief Justice and I am proud of our history. I saw everything that went on in that office and I’ve never worked for anybody who was more considerate, honest, or kind. We all enjoyed our tenure there. He was always up and above board. If any of these people who are slandering the good name of Roy Moore had ever worked with Judge they would know what a fine person he is. My history with Judge Moore was nothing but pleasurable and this is all upsetting to me.” – Marianne Rhodes, receptionist for Roy Moore during his tenure as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court from 2000-2003.

​”I feel it my duty to say that I have known Roy Moore since I was a kid. I worked closely with Roy (adjoining offices) when I was 16 years old. I went to school half a day and worked at the bank half a day. NEVER did he in any way make me feel uncomfortable, flirt, or make advances towards me. He was always a kind and respectable man. We are still friends to this day and I would put my life in his hands if need be. There is not way that these statements these people are making are true. Someone is getting some hefty perks coming from the lies that are being told. I appreciate and respect everything that Roy has done for our state and citizens.”

 – Elaine Conner Watson, native of Gadsden, Alabama.

“I have known Roy Moore and his family for over thirty years. I spent a great deal of time as a child with his nieces, who lived in close proximity to Mr. Moore’s residence. There was never a time I felt uncomfortable or witnessed any inappropriate behavior by him . We have attended the same church for over twenty years and I have always had the utmost respect for the life he leads and the principles he stands for.” – Amanda Pearce, Gadsden, Alabama.

“My name is Doris Mason. I have known Roy Moore for over 50 years. I first met him when I started dating his first cousin, Dennis Mason. Dennis and I married in 1965, eventually had 4 children (3 of whom are girls) and we frequently visited his childhood home prior to our marriage. Roy has been nothing short of a true gentleman toward me, my daughters, and anyone else I have witnessed his interaction with. He spent many evenings in our home around our dinner table. Roy has spent time with all of our children at length and he has always displayed integrity, honesty and impeccable character. It is my belief that the accusations against Roy are completely false! Do I believe that Roy is perfect? Certainly not. No human is. What I do know is that he is a man that I trust and offer my utmost respect to because he has never been anything but respectful towards me and my family!” – Doris Mason, Attalla, Alabama.

“I have known Roy Moore for 25 years. Roy has always been a kind, caring and generous Man of God. I have never heard anything bad said about Roy. He is a wonderful spiritual leader to his family and has exceptional character.”

 -Brenda Parrish, Gallant, Alabama.

“My name is Angie Johnson. We have know Roy Moore and his family for more than 25 years. His son was coached on a ball team by my husband ..a team player along side my son. Roy also helped with coaching the team. My husband and I have been guests in his home, in his office in Gadsden as well as Montgomery. I am acquaintances with several members of Roys family. I have never known Roy to exhibit anything other than appropriate behavior during our times together. Further I was raised and lived in Gadsden all of my 50+ years and I have never been aware of any of the incidents that have been spoken of about Roy. I worked in a fast food establishment that Roy frequented during the time period in question. Again …no behaviour exhibited other than respect and mannerful…during that time Roy had written and recorded a 45 record which he brought over and gifted to my mother. I do not understand waiting years and years to make accusations unless there are political or monetary gains to be made. It is a sad day when someone can take a person’s character and attempt to discredit them by making accusations that cannot be proven. How quick everyone is to take the position of judge, juror, and executioner. What if the shoe was on the other foot. I would never condone sexual harassment against anyone if proven.”

 – Angie Johnson, native of Gadsden.

“My name is Linda Whitt. I had the pleasure of meeting Roy Moore around 15 years ago. He is related to my husband’s brother-in-law. I have never known Roy to be anything other than a gentleman. With that being said, it saddens me that there are those who seek to tarnish the reputation of a good man.” – Linda Whitt, Duck Springs, Alabama.

“I have known Roy Moore all my life. He is one of the most godly men I’ve even known. I would trust him with my life and I could call on him for anything and I know he’d be there. He’s a wonderful husband, father and granddaddy and loves his family dearly.” – Jennifer Price, Gallant, Alabama.",conspiracy
1057,"Reporter Ben Swann Suspended for Trying to Revive TV Show to Expose Elites

Mainstream Media news reporter Ben Swann has been suspended after trying to revive his TV show ""Reality Check.""

The CBS anchor was suspended last year after attempting to expose an elite pedophile ring during a news report on national TV.

The investigative journalist was taken off air in early 2017 for reporting on Pizzagate and claiming that it ""wasn't fake news.""

Shortly after his daring exposé, all of his social media accounts ""went dark"" and his show was canceled.

Now, Swann has been taken off the air again following efforts to revive his independent investigative operation he called Reality Check came to light.

AJC reports: On Thursday night, Swann posted a video on Vimeo teasing about an upcoming new project he planned to announce next Tuesday. He only identified himself as an “investigative journalist” and did not reference his ties to CBS46.

The video by Friday morning had been seen more than 2,000 times. After CBS46 learned of the video, he was suspended and the video removed from Vimeo. (The video is still available on Twitter.)

Prior to arriving at CBS46 in 2015, Swann had built a national following, largely among alt-right conservative types, with his Truth in Media “Reality Check” stories that delved into issues, he said, the mainstream media ignored.

While at CBS46 from 2015 into early 2017, he continued to do those stories on his website, sometimes airing pieces for the station as well.

Swann a year ago did a six-minute story during the 11 p.m CBS46 newscasts as part of his “Reality Check” series about the ""debunked"" Pizzagate conspiracy theory, wondering why there was no further investigation.

He had done no independent reporting and the story had no connection to Atlanta.

Media Matters and the Daily Beast soon went after him and he was taken off the air for a few days.

The Daily Beast reported at the time that his Truth in Media site was tied to a Republican PAC.

Plus, he had previously done work for the Russian-government supported Russia Today before coming to Atlanta.

After the media backlash, Swann pulled his Truth in Media website down as well as most of his social media accounts.

Through the rest of 2017, he largely stayed quiet beyond reporting local news with Sharon Reed in the evenings.",conspiracy
589,"Gary Neville has got it wrong...the Dog and Duck v the Red Lion isn’t Liverpool against United, it’s Sunday’s game at the ­Emirates.

In fact, I reckon I may have to watch a Sunday pub game instead to get my fix of real football, because at least there will be a decent pint at stake.

There is virtually nothing riding on this game, and it is a sad sign of just how far both Arsenal and Manchester United have slipped. It used to be the game of the season, it used to be the Premier League fixture that had people ­talking for weeks beforehand.

It used to guarantee controversy and ­incident too. I still ­remember Ruud van Nistelrooy’s face after he missed that ­penalty and Martin Keown did his impression of Count Dracula.

I’m almost ­reluctant to say this, as a former Liverpool player, but I felt for Ruud that day.

As a member of the striker’s union, I felt genuinely sorry for him.

You never want to see anyone suffer like that. The misery of missing a penalty in a high-profile fixture is agony – I did it at Goodison and I got slaughtered by their fans.

And I didn’t even have the Count swooping down on me to draw blood!

I think we gave Martin some serious stick for that, the next time Liverpool’s England lads met him.

He is a good lad, so he would have taken it in good humour. Either that, or he tried to kick me and missed, just like all the times I played against him.

Just like Liverpool and United in the 70s and 80s, this was the biggest game of the season by miles. Now, it’s just car-crash TV – people tuning in to see who suffers more. I think of the teams United had – Keane, Scholes, Gary Neville. They would have gone there, thinking it was to win the title.

Now, the current crop are hoping not to go there at all, so they can rest before the Europa League semi.

It’s even worse for Arsenal. I reckon there was not a fan in the country who would put them outside the top four at the start of the season. Now, they need a bit of a miracle to make it.

It’s a sad, horrible state of affair for Arsene Wenger and he doesn’t deserve it.

I genuinely feel it is a bit sad he’s clinging on like this, maybe ­losing a tiny bit of his dignity with every bad result and every chant of “Wenger out”.

My hope is he goes on to win the FA Cup and shocks a few ­people by saying he is going out on a high.

I would like to say I am passionate about him winning today, too – but like most the rest of the ­country I don’t really give a monkey’s.

And when you consider how much cash they have spent, how high they have flown, how big the clubs are, that is a terrible ­indictment of where they are now.

Yes, no doubt, Jose Mourinho will say he’s had a successful season.

One cup, a foot in another final, and a great chance of making the ­Champions League.

But come on, this is Arsenal-Man U. Keane-Vieira, Pizzagate. The Count. The title showdown. It’s such a shame for both clubs – and they will need serious surgery to address it.",mainstream
1220,"In the editors’ note, Infowars said Mr. Fontaine later asked for the photo to be removed, but by that time, it had already been taken down.

But the short time it did appear on the site caused lasting damage, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Fontaine continues to be harassed and receive threats, the lawsuit said, and is seeking more than $1 million in damages.

Led by Mr. Jones, who has repeatedly asserted that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was “completely fake” and that the Sept. 11 terror attacks were an “inside job,” Infowars attracts millions of visitors every month with stories often based on unsupported claims and conspiracy theories. With little evidence, Infowars and Mr. Jones, the host of a popular radio show, have propagated wild allegations that they have ended up having to retract.

In March 2017, Mr. Jones apologized for spreading the hoax known as Pizzagate, which claimed that top Democratic officials operated a satanic child pornography ring in the basement of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington pizza restaurant. His apology came three months after a man motivated by the conspiracy theory fired a rifle inside the restaurant. In May 2017, Mr. Jones retracted several stories and issued an apology to Chobani Yogurt in order to resolve a lawsuit filed by the company for asserting that its Idaho factory, which employs refugees, was connected to a 2016 sexual assault of a child.

The shooting at Stoneman Douglas High, along with the student survivors who have since led impassioned rallies for restrictions on guns, quickly attracted the attention of far-right provocateurs. A month after the shooting, YouTube cracked down on some fringe groups whose conspiracy-theory videos had climbed the site’s “trending” list. YouTube issued a warning against Infowars, which had published a video that falsely claimed that a Stoneman Douglas student, David Hogg, was a “crisis actor.”

In the lawsuit, Mr. Bankston said that the Infowars story about the school gunman fell in line with the site’s overall strategy. “These sorts of reckless lies are what caused a disturbed individual to enter a pizzeria and begin firing,” he said.

“Alex Jones is no longer a gimmick or sideshow. His audience rivals that of major cable networks, yet he refuses to exercise the most basic journalistic integrity,” Mr. Bankston added on Tuesday. “What happened to Mr. Fontaine is the predictable result of the reckless practices Mr. Jones has fostered at Infowars.”",mainstream
432,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Six more families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre victims sued right-wing radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for alleged defamation Wednesday for claiming the shooting was a hoax and the relatives are paid actors.

An FBI agent who responded to the shooting joined the families as a plaintiff in the lawsuit filed in Bridgeport Superior Court in Connecticut. The families of two other victims filed similar defamation lawsuits against Jones last month in Travis County, Texas, where his media company, Infowars, is based.

A gunman killed 20 first-graders and six educators at the Newtown, Connecticut, school on Dec. 14, 2012. The families say Jones’ comments have tormented them and subjected them to harassment and death threats by his followers.

“He knew his claims were false but he made them anyway to further a simple but pathetic goal: to make money by tearing away at the families’ pain,” said Josh Koskoff, a lawyer for the families. “This lawsuit seeks to hold Alex Jones and his financial network accountable for those disgraceful actions.”

Jones did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday.

The lawsuit seeks monetary and punitive damages, attorney fees and other costs. It does not say exactly how much money the families are seeking.

After the first two lawsuits were filed last month, Jones responded in a YouTube video, saying that the families are being used by the Democratic Party and the news media and that he believes Sandy Hook “really happened.” He also invited parents who lost their children to his show to have a “real discussion” about guns, and said believes the lawsuits will be thrown out.

The plaintiffs include the parents of four children killed at the school — Daniel Barden, Dylan Hockley, Ben Wheeler and Avielle Richman. Also suing are relatives of two slain educators — school Principal Dawn Hochsprung and first-grade teacher Victoria Soto. FBI agent William Aldenberg, one of the first responders to the scene, also is a plaintiff.

Also named as defendants is Wolfgang Halbig, who the families say is a frequent guest on Jones’ show who also questions whether the school shooting actually happened.

Halbig, 71, a former police officer who lives in Sorrento, Florida, said Wednesday that he does believe people died in the shooting, but authorities have refused to answer his questions. He said police won’t give him a copy of radio transmissions from a state police helicopter that responded to the shooting, won’t say why paramedics and emergency medical technicians weren’t allowed in the school and won’t say who pronounced the deaths of all the children.

In separate lawsuits filed last month in Texas, the parents of slain children Jesse Lewis and Noah Pozner sued Jones seeking more than $1 million in damages for alleged defamation.

It mentions Edgar Maddison, a North Carolina man sentenced to prison for shooting up a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant in 2016, believing a conspiracy theory that prominent Democrats were harboring child sex slaves there. The lawsuit says Maddison had watched an Infowars video about the “pizzagate” conspiracy theory.

The lawsuit also cites the case of a Florida woman, Lucy Richards, who believed the shooting was a hoax and was sentenced to prison last year for threatening the father of one of the slain children.",mainstream
1129,"Twitter is promoting a debunked conspiracy theory which claims that many of the world’s most powerful people are running a child trafficking ring.

The “Pizzagate” hashtag appeared in the social network’s trending topics on Tuesday and reached the top of the “For you” section of the app for some users.

Twitter users who tapped on the hashtag were shown more than 40,000 tweets about the subject, many of which falsely accused prominent politicians and Hollywood actors of raping children.

The conspiracy appeared despite efforts by the company to increase its use of fact check labels on misleading and inaccurate tweets.

Proponents of the false theory believe that hacked emails include coded messages to a child trafficking ring hidden by the world’s elite.

In December 2016, a man was arrested after firing three shots inside a Washington, D.C. pizza restaurant which had been linked to the conspiracy.

Michael Marshall, the project director at sceptical organisation Good Thinking Society, said: “This is not a harmless idea, and it is remarkable to see Twitter make an active choice to direct people to this conspiracy theory.”

“By featuring this term in their Explore tab, they are making an editorial decision to expose more people to this extremist idea, people who may never have otherwise found it, and who may come to believe it.”

The social network was previously criticised for allowing conspiracy theories around the death of Jeffrey Epstein to trend following the discovery of his body.

Controversy over Twitter’s trending topics comes as The Daily Telegraph found that a new system to limit coronavirus misinformation has failed to properly label many conspiracy theories.

In a survey of search results for the phrase ""5G coronavirus"", only two out of 79 posts were labelled correctly, as opposed to 23 that had been wrongly labelled and seven that should have been labelled but weren't.

A Twitter spokesman said the labelling of the tweets was a work in progress. “This is why we are taking an iterative approach, so that we can learn and make adjustments along the way,” he said.",mainstream
169,"WASHINGTON - A North Carolina man who fired an assault rifle inside a District of Columbia restaurant during his investigation of a conspiracy theory dubbed ""pizzagate"" was sentenced Thursday to four years in prison.

U.S. District Judge Kentanji B. Jackson said that while no one was injured when Edgar Maddison Welch fired his weapon inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant on Dec. 4, his actions ""literally left psychological wreckage.""

Welch acknowledged as part of a guilty plea in March that he entered the restaurant with an AR-15 and a revolver. He said he drove to the restaurant from North Carolina to investigate unfounded internet rumors about Democrats harboring child sex slaves there.

The judge said Welch ""forged ahead"" with an ""ill-conceived plot"" even though others urged him to abandon it. If Welch believed children were being harmed, he should have notified law enforcement, the judge said.

Welch's attorney had asked for a sentence of 1½ years in prison. Prosecutors wanted 4½ years.

Welch spoke briefly to apologize, saying he realized that his words ""cannot undo or change what already happened.""

His mother, father, sister and fiancée were in the courtroom.

Two Comet Ping Pong workers and owner James Alefantis spoke before sentencing. Alefantis called ""pizzagate"" a ""viscous web of lies"" and said many people had suffered because of Welch's actions.",mainstream
566,"InfoWars is a far-right[2] American conspiracy theory[3] and fake news website[1] owned by Alex Jones.[25][26] It was founded in 1999, and operates under Free Speech Systems LLC.[27]

Talk shows and other content for the site are created primarily in studios at an undisclosed location in an industrial area in the outskirts of Austin, Texas.[28] The InfoWars website receives approximately 10 million monthly visits, making its reach greater than some mainstream news websites such as The Economist and Newsweek.[29][30]

The site has regularly published fake stories which have been linked to harassment of victims.[a] In February 2018, Jones, the publisher, director and owner of InfoWars, was accused of discrimination and sexually harassing employees.[37] InfoWars, and in particular Jones, advocate numerous conspiracy theories particularly around purported domestic false flag operations by the U.S. Government (which they allege include the 9/11 attacks and Sandy Hook shootings). InfoWars has issued retractions various times as a result of legal challenges.[33][34] Jones has had contentious material removed, and has also been suspended and banned from many platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, iTunes,[38][39][40][41] and Roku.[42]

InfoWars earns revenue from the sale of products pitched by Jones during the show, including dietary supplements. It has been called as much ""an online store that uses Mr. Jones's commentary to move merchandise"", as a media outlet.[43]

InfoWars was created in 1999 by American conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who remains its controlling influence.[44][45] InfoWars features The Alex Jones Show on their broadcasts and was established as a public-access television program aired in Austin, Texas in 1999.[44]

During the 2016 presidential election, the website was promoted by bots connected to the Russian government.[46]

In 2016, Paul Joseph Watson was hired as editor-at-large.[47][48] In February 2017, political commentator Jerome Corsi was hired as Washington bureau chief,[49] after InfoWars was granted a White House day pass.[50] In June 2018, Corsi's connection to InfoWars ended; he received six months severance payments.[51]

In May 2017, Mike Cernovich joined the InfoWars team as a scheduled guest host for The Alex Jones Show,[52] with CNN reporting the ""elevation to InfoWars host represents the meteoric rise in his profile"".[53]

In June 2017, it was announced Roger Stone, a former campaign advisor for Donald Trump, would be hosting his own InfoWars show ""five nights a week"", with an extra studio being built to accommodate his show.[26]

In March 2018, a number of major brands in the U.S. suspended their ads from InfoWars's YouTube channels, after CNN notified them.[54]

In July 2018, YouTube removed four of InfoWars's uploaded videos that violated its policy against hate speech and suspended posts for 90 days. Facebook also banned Jones after it determined four videos on his pages violated its community standards in July 2018.[38][39] In August 2018, YouTube, Apple, and Facebook removed content from Jones and InfoWars, citing their policies against hate speech and harassment.[40]

On March 12, 2020, Attorney General of New York Letitia James issued a cease and desist letter to Jones for InfoWars's sale of unapproved products that were falsely asserted to be government-approved treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[55] On April 9, the FDA ordered InfoWars to discontinue selling products marketed as remedies for COVID-19 in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including toothpaste, liquid, and gel containing colloidal silver.[56][57]

While Jones has stated, ""I'm not a business guy, I'm a revolutionary"", he spends much of InfoWars's air time pitching dietary supplements and survivalist products to his audience. As a private firm, InfoWars and its affiliated limited liability companies are not required to make public financial statements; as a result, observers can only estimate its revenue and profits.[43]

Prior to 2013, Jones focused on building a ""media empire"".[58] By 2013, Alex Seitz-Wald of Salon estimated that Jones was earning as much as $10 million a year between subscriptions, web and radio advertising, and sales of DVDs, T-shirts, and other merchandise.[59] That year, Jones changed his business model to incorporate selling proprietary dietary supplements, including one that promised to ""supercharge"" cognitive functions.[58]

Unlike most talk radio shows, InfoWars itself does not directly generate income. It gets no syndication fees from its syndicater GCN, no cut of the advertising that GCN sells, and it does not sell its three minutes per hour of national advertising time. The show no longer promotes its video service (though it still exists), and has not made any documentary films since 2012.[58] Virtually all money is made by selling Jones's dietary supplements to viewers and listeners through the site's online store.[58]

The supplements sold on the InfoWars store are primarily sourced from Dr. Edward F. Group III, a chiropractor who founded the Global Healing Center supplement vendor.[58] A significant portion of InfoWars's products contain colloidal silver, which Jones falsely claimed ""kills every virus"", including ""the whole SARS-corona family""; this claim was disputed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[60]

A lesser source of revenue for InfoWars is its ""money bomb"" telethons, which resemble public radio fundraisers, except InfoWars is a for-profit institution. According to former InfoWars employees, a money bomb was able to raise $100,000 in a day.[61]

In 2014, Jones claimed that InfoWars was accumulating over $20 million in annual revenue. The New York Times attributed most the revenue to sales of supplements, including ""Super Male Vitality"" and ""Brain Force Plus"", which InfoWars purported would increase testosterone and mental agility, respectively.[43] Court documents in 2014 indicate that InfoWars was successful enough for Jones and his then-wife to be planning to ""build a swimming pool complex ... featuring a waterfall and dining cabana with a stone fireplace"". The documents also listed Jones's possessions, including four Rolex watches, a $40,000 saltwater aquarium, a $70,000 grand piano, $50,000 in weapons, and $70,000 in jewelry.[43]

After InfoWars was banned by Facebook, YouTube, Apple, Spotify, and Pinterest, Jones appealed to viewers, ""The enemy wants to cut off our funding to destroy us. If you don't fund us, we'll be shut down.""[43]

InfoWars disseminates various conspiracy theories, including false claims against the HPV vaccine[31] and claims the 2017 Las Vegas shooting was part of a conspiracy.[62]

InfoWars advocates New World Order conspiracy theories, 9/11 conspiracy theories, the chemtrail conspiracy theory, conspiracy theories involving Bill Gates, supposed covert government weather control programs, claims of rampant domestic false flag operations by the US Government (including 9/11), and the unsupported claim that millions voted illegally in the 2016 US presidential election.[63][64] Jones frequently uses InfoWars to assert that mass shootings are conspiracies or ""false flag"" operations, claims which often spread.[65][66] This has been characterized as Second Amendment ""fan fiction"".[67]

Infowars has published and promoted fake news,[35] and Jones has been accused of knowingly misleading people to make money.[68] As part of the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, Infowars was investigated to see if it was complicit in the dissemination of fake news stories distributed by Russian bots.[69]

From May 2014 to November 2017, InfoWars republished articles from multiple sources without permission, including over 1,000 from Russian state-sponsored news network RT, as well as stories from news outlets such as CNN, the BBC, and The New York Times which Salon said were ""dwarfed"" by those from RT.[70][71]

InfoWars has regularly accused mass shootings of being false flags and survivors of them as crisis actors by the United States government. InfoWars host Alex Jones has promoted the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories. Jones was much criticized for claiming the Sandy Hook massacre was ""completely fake"" and ""manufactured"".[32]

In March 2018, six families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, as well as an FBI agent who responded to the attack, filed a defamation lawsuit against Jones for his role in spreading conspiracy theories about the shooting.[72][73][74][75] In December 2019, InfoWars and Jones were ordered to pay $100,000 in legal fees prior to the trial for another defamation lawsuit from a different family whose son was killed in the shooting.[76][77]

Jones has accused David Hogg and other survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting of being crisis actors.[78]

InfoWars promoted fabricated Pizzagate claims. The fake claims led to harassment of the owner and employees of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington, D.C. pizzeria targeted by the conspiracy theories, including threatening phone calls, online harassment, and death threats. The owner sent a letter to Jones in February 2017 demanding a retraction or apology. (Such a letter is required before a party may seek punitive damages in an action for libel under Texas law).[79]

After receiving the letter, Jones said, ""I want our viewers and listeners to know that we regret any negative impact our commentaries may have had on Mr. Alefantis, Comet Ping Pong, or its employees. We apologize to the extent our commentaries could be construed as negative statements about Mr. Alefantis or Comet Ping Pong, and we hope that anyone else involved in commenting on Pizzagate will do the same thing."" InfoWars also issued a correction on its website.[80]

InfoWars reporter Owen Shroyer also targeted East Side Pies, a group of pizza restaurants in Austin, Texas, with similar fake ""Pizzagate"" claims. Following the claims, the pizza business was targeted by phone threats, vandalism, and harassment, which the co-owners called ""alarming, disappointing, disconcerting and scary"".[36]

In 2017, InfoWars (along with similar sites) published a fake story about U.S. yogurt manufacturer Chobani, with headlines including ""Idaho yogurt maker caught importing migrant rapists"" and ""allegations that Chobani's practice of hiring refugees brought crime and tuberculosis to Twin Falls"". Chobani ultimately filed a federal lawsuit against Jones, which led to a settlement on confidential terms in May 2017. Jones offered an apology and retraction, admitting he had made ""certain statements"" on InfoWars ""that I now understand to be wrong"".[33][34]

In February 2018, Alex Jones was accused by former employees of antisemitism and sexual harassment of women staff members. Jones denied the allegations.[81][82]

Two former employees filed complaints against Jones.[83]

On July 27, 2018, Facebook suspended Alex Jones's official page for thirty days, claiming Jones had participated in hate speech against Robert Mueller.[84] This was swiftly followed by action from other bodies—on August 6, Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify all removed content by Alex Jones and InfoWars from their platforms for violating their policies. YouTube removed channels associated with Infowars, including The Alex Jones Channel, which had gained 2.4 million subscriptions prior to its removal.[85] On Facebook, four pages associated with InfoWars and Alex Jones were removed due to repeated violations of the website's policies. Apple removed all podcasts associated with Jones from its iTunes platform and its podcast app.[40] On August 13, Vimeo removed all Jones's videos because they ""violated our terms of service prohibitions on discriminatory and hateful content"".[86] By February 2019, a total of 89 pages associated with InfoWars or Alex Jones had been removed from Facebook due to its recidivism policy, which is designed to prevent circumventing a ban.[87] In May 2019, President Donald Trump tweeted or retweeted defenses of people associated with InfoWars, including editor Paul Joseph Watson and host Alex Jones, after the Facebook ban.[88]

Jones's accounts have also been removed from Pinterest,[89] Mailchimp[90] and LinkedIn.[91] As of early August, Jones still had active accounts on Instagram[92] and Twitter.[93][94] Twitter, however, ultimately decided to permanently deactivate Jones's account as well as the InfoWars account in September 2018.[95] Wikipedia blacklisted InfoWars as a source in 2018; the Wikipedia community has determined that InfoWars is a ""conspiracy theorist and fake news website"".[96]

Jones tweeted a Periscope video calling on others ""to get their battle rifles ready against antifa, the mainstream media, and Chicom operatives"".[97] In the video he also says, ""Now is time to act on the enemy before they do a false flag."" Twitter cited this as the reason to suspend his account for a week on August 14.[98] On September 6, Twitter permanently banned InfoWars and Alex Jones for repeated violations of the site's terms and conditions. Twitter cited abusive behavior, namely a video that ""shows Jones shouting at and berating CNN journalist Oliver Darcy for some 10 minutes during congressional hearings about social media.""[41]

On September 7, 2018, the InfoWars app was removed from the Apple App Store.[99] On September 20, 2018, PayPal informed InfoWars they would cease processing payments in ten days because ""promotion of hate and discrimination runs counter to our core value of inclusion.""[100] On May 2, 2019, Facebook and Instagram banned Jones and InfoWars as part of a larger ban of far-right extremists. The ban included videos, audio clips, and articles from InfoWars, but excluded criticism of InfoWars. Facebook indicated it would take down groups that violated the ban.[101] The InfoWars app was pulled from Google Play on March 27, 2020, for violating its policies on spreading ""misleading or harmful disinformation"", after Jones opposed efforts to contain coronavirus disease 2019 and said ""natural antivirals"" could treat the disease.[102]

Alex Jones is the main host, and operator of InfoWars.

Owen Shroyer (born 1989) is an American political activist and commentator from St. Louis who now lives and works in Texas. He is considered to be part of the US alt-right movement.[103]

Shroyer previously worked as an AM radio host in St. Louis on KXFN and later KFNS.[104][105] He began hosting a podcast and posting YouTube videos of his views. Shroyer has been quoted as supporting conspiracy theories about the Clinton family.[106]

In July 2016, Shroyer stopped CNN presenter Van Jones in the streets of Cleveland and attempted to engage him in an unscheduled on-camera debate. Van Jones participated willingly, and put forward well-constructed arguments, leading Shroyer to admit his opinion of Van Jones had changed favorably following the encounter.[107][108][109]

On September 2, 2017, while covering a pro-immigrant rally in Austin, Texas, for InfoWars, Shroyer repeatedly put questions to protesters. He started to question a teenager, Olivia Williams, about her views. She, in return, called him a ""fucking idiot"", leading to international coverage of the incident.[110]

In November 2017, Shroyer was quoted as saying Trump supporters outnumbered anti-Trump protesters at an antifa rally held in Austin on November 4, 2017.[111] InfoWars headlines had previously supported a conspiracy theory that the event would be the beginning of a planned ""insurgency"" against Trump, although Shroyer had said he did not believe antifa was a real threat.[112]",mainstream
1022,"Cesc Fabregas has dealt a huge blow to Manchester United's hopes of landing the Spaniard by publicly committing his future to Chelsea.

The 30-year-old has been linked with a move to Old Trafford in recent weeks, a switch that would see him reunite with former boss Jose Mourinho.

And speculation further intensified when Fabregas revealed he still has sleepless nights over Mourinho's sacking at Chelsea, and that he remains close with the United boss.

However, the midfielder has dashed any speculation of a move by saying he wants a new contract at Chelsea.

""Would I like to renew?"" Fabregas told The Evening Standard . ""Yes, because it is a club that has always treated me well.

""I believe the fans have a lot of respect for me and I have a lot of respect for them. I have given my all for the club for the last three-and-a-half years.

""This is a fantastic club for me and I have had a fantastic time here. Hopefully another contract will happen. Time will tell.""",mainstream
882,"The social news site Reddit has occasionally been the topic of controversy due to the presence of communities on the site (known as ""subreddits"") devoted to explicit or controversial material. In 2012, Yishan Wong, the site's then-CEO, stated, ""We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it.""[1] However, numerous subreddits have since been banned on the basis of ideology.[2]

The subreddit r/jailbait, devoted to suggestive or revealing photos of underage girls, was one of the most prominent subreddits on the site before it was closed down in October 2011 following a report by CNN.[3] The controversy surrounding r/Creepshots, devoted to revealing or suggestive photos of women taken without their awareness or consent, occurred a year after r/jailbait's closure. The r/Creepshots controversy prompted a Gawker exposé of one of the subreddit's moderators by Adrian Chen, which revealed the real-life identity of the user behind the account, Michael Brutsch. This started discussion in the media about the ethics of anonymity and outing on the Internet.[4]

In 2015, Reddit introduced a quarantine policy to make visiting certain subreddits more difficult. Visiting or joining a quarantined subreddit requires bypassing a warning prompt.[5] Since 2018, subreddits are allowed to appeal their quarantine.[6] Some subreddits are banned after unsuccessful quarantines.

On 9 June 2014, a subreddit called r/beatingwomen was closed by Reddit. The community, which featured graphic depictions of violence against women, was banned after its moderators were found to be sharing users' personal information online, and collaborating to protect one another from sitewide bans. Following the ban, the community's founder rebooted the subreddit under the name r/beatingwomen2 in an attempt to circumvent the ban, but was banned afterwards.[7][8]

r/Braincels was the most popular subreddit for incels after r/Incels was banned, gaining 16,900 followers by April 2018. The subreddit's leaders decided to ban individuals advocating for murder.[9] However, the subreddit promoted rape and suicide.[10] The subreddit was banned on September 30, 2019, after violating Reddit's Content Policy with respect to bullying and harassment.[11]

r/ChapoTrapHouse was a subreddit dedicated to the leftist podcast Chapo Trap House which is associated with the term dirtbag left.[12][13] The community had 160,000 regulars before being banned on June 29, 2020 because they ""consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.""[14] Previously, the community had been quarantined for content that promotes violence.[13]

A year after the closure of r/jailbait, another subreddit called r/CreepShots drew controversy in the press for hosting sexualized images of women without their knowledge.[15] In the wake of this media attention, u/violentacrez was added to r/CreepShots as a moderator,[16] and reports emerged that Gawker reporter Adrian Chen was planning an exposé that would reveal the real-life identity of this user, who moderated dozens of controversial subreddits as well as a few hundred general-interest communities. Several major subreddits banned links to Gawker in response to the impending exposé and the account u/violentacrez was deleted.[17][18][19] Moderators defended their decisions to block the site from these sections of Reddit on the basis that the impending report was ""doxing"" (a term for exposing the identity of a pseudonymous person), and that such exposure threatened the site's structural integrity.[19]

When Chen informed u/violentacrez about the impending exposé, the user pleaded with Chen not to publish it because he was concerned about the potential impact on his employment and finances, noting that his wife was disabled and he had a mortgage to pay. He also expressed concern that he would be falsely labeled a child pornographer or anti-semite because of some of the subreddits he created. Despite u/violentacrez's offer to delete his postings and leave Reddit, Chen insisted he would still publish the piece.[4][20]

Chen published the piece on 12 October 2012, revealing that the person operating the u/violentacrez account was a middle-aged programmer from Arlington, Texas named Michael Brutsch.[4][21] Within a day of the article being published, Brutsch was fired by his employer, and the link to the exposé was briefly banned from Reddit.[22][23] He stated on Reddit after the article was published that he had received numerous death threats.[24]

Reddit CEO Yishan Wong defended the content Brutsch contributed to the site as free speech and criticized efforts to ban the Gawker link on the same basis.[25] Wong stated that the staff had considered a site-wide ban on the link, but rejected this idea for fear it would create a negative impression of the site without getting results.[26] Brutsch later briefly returned to Reddit on a different account and criticized what he stated were numerous factual inaccuracies in the Gawker exposé.[27]

A week after the exposé, Brutsch held an interview with CNN that aired on Anderson Cooper 360°. In the interview with journalist Drew Griffin, Brutsch was apologetic about his activity on Reddit. He explained that he was most fond of the appreciation he got from other redditors, and that Reddit helped him relieve stress. Brutsch also described the support he had from administrators, stating that he had received an award for his contributions. Reddit noted that the award was for winning a community vote for ""Worst Subreddit"", and stated that they regretted sending it, as well as claiming the u/violentacrez account had been banned on several occasions.[28][29] Brutsch subsequently noted on Reddit that he regretted doing the interview and criticized the accuracy of the statement Reddit gave to CNN.[30]

Chris Slowe, a lead programmer of Reddit until 2010, said of the relationship between Brutsch and the Reddit staff: ""We just stayed out of there and let him do his thing and we knew at least he was getting rid of a lot of stuff that wasn't particularly legal.""[4]

Gawker's outing of Brutsch as u/violentacrez led to contentious discussion about privacy and anonymity on the Internet.[31] Such discussions included claims that outing, or ""doxing"", was necessary to draw attention to objectionable content so it could be removed, while others claimed that it impeded the ability for people to exercise their right to legal free speech online due to fear of public retribution.[32][33]

Sady Doyle, writing in The Guardian, compared it to the outing of the alleged blackmailer of Amanda Todd and suggested that such outings may be justified, but that they may also unduly focus attention on individuals without confronting the underlying problems by engaging in ""sensationalism"" at the expense of cultural reform.[34] In PC Magazine, Damon Poeter stated that, while he has defended protecting anonymity on the Internet, he still supported Brutsch being outed because he felt the various subreddits he contributed to as u/violentacrez were serious invasions of privacy, regardless of legality, and that it was therefore justifiable to reveal his personal details.[33]

The public outpouring of hostility towards Brutsch following the exposé prompted commentators such as danah boyd of Wired and Michelle Star of CNET to question the morality of outing as a way to enforce societal standards online.[35][36] Several commentators have expressed concern that the public shaming of Brutsch to serve as an example to others is legitimizing online vigilantism and exposing individuals such as Brutsch to mass retribution.[35][36][37][38]

r/CringeAnarchy was a subreddit themed around ""cringe"" and ""edgy"", politically incorrect content, featuring far-right content. Originally an uncensored (hence ""anarchy"") spinoff of r/cringe,[39] it later shifted to the far-right, with anti-transgender and anti-""SJW"" content taking over.[40][41][42] The subreddit was quarantined in September 2018, at which point it had over 400,000 subscribers.[43][44][45]

Following the Christchurch mosque shootings (15 March 2019), more anti-Muslim posts were made on the subreddit.[46] The subreddit was banned on 25 April 2019 for violating Reddit's content policy regarding violent content.

The subreddit r/DarkNetMarkets, a darknet market discussion forum, featured participation from their owners, causing US authorities to request personal information behind several accounts.[47][48] This subreddit was banned on 21 March 2018.[49][50]

Deepfakes was a controversial subreddit that superimposed famous female actresses onto pornographic videos, made using FakeApp, without the consent of the actresses.[51] Such actresses included Emma Watson and Daisy Ridley.[51][52] After the subreddit was given notoriety from the press, videos from the subreddit were banned from Gfycat and Discord. On 7 February 2018, the day after Pornhub banned the videos, the subreddit was banned as well.[53]

On 10 June 2015, Reddit banned five subreddits, citing an anti-harassment policy.[54][55] The largest of the banned subreddits, r/fatpeoplehate, had an estimated 151,000 subscribers at the time of its banning.[54] The other four subreddits were r/hamplanethatred, r/neofag, r/transfags, and r/shitniggerssay.[54] A Reddit admin said, ""We will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to harass individuals when moderators don’t take action"".[54]

Because of the ban, Reddit users flooded the site with pictures of overweight people and Reddit's interim CEO Ellen Pao.[56] Due to the decision to ban these subreddits, some users moved to Voat, a social aggregation website similar to Reddit.[57]

Related to the Christchurch mosque shootings, r/gore was banned for ""glorifying or encouraging violence"" at approximately 17:35 UTC on 15 March 2019.

The subreddit r/greatawakening was a subreddit for the QAnon conspiracy theory, which argues the Trump administration is investigating a widespread child sex trafficking movement. The subreddit was banned on 12 September 2018 due to violating Reddit's content policy regarding violence and personal information.[61] A previous subreddit for the conspiracy theory, r/CBTS_Stream, was banned on 14 March 2018 for violating Reddit's content policy against violence. A backup for the subreddit, r/The_GreatAwakening, was also banned.

In January 2014, Mother Jones published a story describing the sale of guns on the site. The report suggested that sellers were doing so to exploit a loophole in U.S. federal law.[62] Nearly 100 AR-15s were engraved with the Reddit logo as part of a licensing deal made with the page in 2011.[63] This subreddit was banned on 21 March 2018.

A subreddit founded for ""involuntary celibates"", r/incels, was a forum wherein members discussed their lack of romantic success.[64] The definition of an incel on the subreddit was someone who has unintentionally gone at least six months without a romantic partner and is at least 21 years old; self-described incels are largely heterosexual men.[65] Many members adhered to the ""black pill"" ideology,[66][67][68] which espoused despondency often coupled with misogynistic views that condoned, downplayed, or advocated rape, while referring to women as ""femoids"" and ""sluts"".[65] Notable black pill posts included ""reasons why women are the embodiment of evil"" and ""proof that girls are nothing but trash that use men"".[69][70] Users deemed too female-friendly, or who claimed that women experienced inceldom to the same extent as men, were banned.[70] The subreddit's users intermittently either revered or hated ""normies"" and ""Chads"" for their courtship abilities, with some admiring murderers such as Elliot Rodger, perpetrator of the 2014 Isla Vista killings, who identified as an ""incel"".[71][72][73]

In the summer of 2017, a petition on Change.org called for r/incels to be banned for inciting violence against women.[74] Following the October implementation of a new Reddit policy that prohibited the incitement of violence, the subreddit was banned on 7 November 2017.[75] At the time of its banning, r/incels had around 40,000 subscribers.[69]

r/Braincels subsequently became the most popular subreddit for incels, gaining 16,900 followers by April 2018. The subreddit's leaders disavowed the Toronto van attack and deleted some posts by members who praised Alek Minassian's alleged actions.[9] In September 2018, the subreddit was quarantined and on October, it was banned.

Reddit's staff was initially opposed to the addition of obscene material to the site, but they eventually became more lenient when prolific moderators, such as a user named u/violentacrez, proved capable of identifying and removing illegal content at a time when they were not sufficiently staffed to take on the task.[4] Communities devoted to explicit material saw rising popularity, with r/jailbait, which featured provocative shots of underage teenagers, being chosen ""subreddit of the year"" in the ""Best of reddit"" user poll in 2008 and at one point making ""jailbait"" the second most common search term for the site.[4] Erik Martin, general manager of Reddit, defended the jailbait subreddit by saying that such controversial pages were a consequence of allowing free speech on the site.[76]

r/jailbait came to wider attention outside Reddit when Anderson Cooper of CNN devoted a segment of his program to condemning the subreddit and criticizing Reddit for hosting it.[77] Initially this caused a spike in Internet traffic to the subreddit, causing the page to peak at 1.73 million views on the day of the report.[78] In the wake of these news reports, a Reddit user posted an image of an underage girl to r/jailbait, subsequently claiming to have naked images of her as well. Dozens of Reddit users then posted requests for these nude photos to be shared to them by private message.[79] Other Reddit users drew attention to this discussion and the r/jailbait forum was subsequently closed by Reddit administrators on 11 October 2011.[79] Critics, such as r/jailbait's creator, disputed claims that this thread was the basis of the decision, instead claiming it was an excuse to close down a controversial subreddit due to recent negative media coverage.[3] Others claimed that the thread believed to have prompted the closure was created by members of the Something Awful forum in an attempt to get the section shut down, rather than the regulars of the forum.[80]

Following the closure of r/jailbait, The Daily Dot declared the community's creator, u/violentacrez, ""The Most Important Person on Reddit in 2011"", calling the r/jailbait controversy ""the first major challenge to the site's voluntary doctrine of absolute free speech"".[81]

Soon after the closure of r/jailbait, the similar subreddits r/teen_girls, r/niggerjailbait and r/picsofdeadjailbait were closed.[citation needed]

In January 2019, a Philippine-based subreddit, r/jakolandia, was accused of ""distributing"" posts of photos of women, including celebrities, apparently without their consent, similar to ""a number"" of secret Facebook groups that had been engaging in illegal activity of sharing ""obscene"" photos of women and possibly child pornography.[82] r/jakolandia was later banned as a result.[citation needed]

The subreddit r/MillionDollarExtreme was a subreddit for the comedy group Million Dollar Extreme. It was banned on 10 September 2018 for violating Reddit's content policy regarding violent content. Content on the subreddit was often racist, homophobic and transphobic in nature. Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace, a television show created by the group, was cancelled in 2016 following coverage of the group's connections to the alt-right. Million Dollar Extreme's YouTube channel had been terminated earlier in 2018.[83] Associated subreddits r/ChadRight, r/BillionShekelSupreme, r/TrillionRubleRegime, r/TrillionRubelRegine, r/GorillionYuanDream, r/HydeNationalism, r/tha_pit, r/QuadrillionEuroDream, r/HundredPesoPipedream, r/SextillionEuroSupreme, r/13451452251849519 and several others were subsequently banned.

""Pizzagate"" is a conspiracy theory that emerged from social media and fake news websites in early November 2016 which falsely alleged the existence of a child trafficking ring that involved officials in the Democratic Party and restaurants such as Comet Ping Pong. The r/pizzagate subreddit, which spun off from r/The_Donald, was dedicated to discussing this conspiracy theory and had over 20,000 subscribers.[84] This subreddit was banned on 23 November 2016, for violating Reddit's policy against doxing, as users would post the personal details of people allegedly connected to this conspiracy.[85]

r/Physical_Removal was banned on 15 August 2017, for inciting violence. The subreddit's name stems from a quote by right-wing libertarian philosopher Hans-Hermann Hoppe, who wrote: ""There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and removed from society"", and, by extension, their advocacy for forced deportation or physical removal of political leftists from the United States. It was controversial for its promotion of violence against leftists and other groups. For instance, users would make reference to throwing people from helicopters, an execution method used by Augusto Pinochet. Physical_Removal attracted further attention in 2017 after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, due to mockery of the death of Heather Heyer, who was struck and killed by a car driven by a far-right terrorist at the rally.[86][87]

r/SanctionedSuicide was a subreddit that approached the topic of suicide from a pro-choice perspective. It included both discussions surrounding the ethics of suicide and posts containing rants from Reddit users.[88] This subreddit was banned on 14 March 2018.

On 15 December 2014, Reddit took the unusual step of banning a subreddit, r/SonyGOP, which was being used to distribute hacked Sony files.[89]

The subreddit r/Shoplifting was devoted to stories, tips, and questions for the purpose of shoplifting at large commercial retail chains. It dissuaded people from shoplifting from smaller stores which were presumed to suffer greater losses from theft. It also heavily featured pictures displaying items that its users had supposedly ""lifted"".[90] Near the end of its existence, over 77,000 people were subscribed to the subreddit.[91] It was banned on 21 March 2018 due to violating an amendment to the Reddit User Agreement added that same day which states: ""Users may not use Reddit to solicit or facilitate any transaction or gift involving certain goods and services, including: ... Stolen goods""[92][93]

The term ""Chimpire"" refers to a collection of subreddits and affiliated websites that promote anti-black racism, including frequent use of racial slurs. In June 2013, the subreddit r/niggers was banned from Reddit for engaging in vote manipulation, incitements of violence and using racist content to disrupt other communities. Reddit general manager Erik Martin noted that the subforum was given multiple chances to comply with site rules, noting that ""users can tell from the amount of warnings we extended to a subreddit as clearly awful as r/niggers that we go into the decision to ban subreddits with a lot of scrutiny"".[94] Following the ban of r/niggers, the subreddit r/Coontown grew to become the most popular ""Chimpire"" site, with over 15,000 members at its peak.[95] Many of the posters on these subreddits were formerly involved with r/niggers.[96][97][98] It was created by a troll known as ""EugeneNix"".[citation needed]

One of these subreddits, r/shitniggerssay, was banned in June 2015 at the same time as fatpeoplehate.[99] In the midst of changes to Reddit's content policy, r/Coontown was banned in August 2015.[100]

The subreddit r/The_Donald, which was intended for supporters of Donald Trump, was originally created for his 2016 presidential campaign. Due to harassment of Reddit administrators and manipulation of the site's algorithms to push content to Reddit's front page using the ""sticky"" feature of subreddits, Reddit banned many of the sub's users who were described as ""toxic"".[101] This occurred after Reddit's CEO Steve Huffman (known as Spez on Reddit) admitted to silently editing comments attacking him made by the community's users. This caused the term ""spez"" to be used instead of ""edit"" in The_Donald's terminology.[102] The CEO modified the site's algorithms to specifically prevent the sub's moderators from gaming the algorithms to artificially push the sub's content to Reddit's front page.[103] Additionally, the CEO introduced a filtering feature which allowed individual users to block content from any sub. While this feature was being worked on prior to the problems r/The_Donald were causing, it was suggested that it was introduced specifically to allow users to block them.[103] Huffman referred to r/The_Donald's user's complaints of harassment ""hypocritical"" because of their harassment of others.[104]

After the Christchurch mosque shootings in 2019, many posts appeared in the subreddit arguing that the shootings were justified, filled with anti-Muslim hate.[105]

The sub was quarantined by Reddit admins in June 2019 for ""threats of violence against police and public officials"".[106][107]

On June 29, 2020, Reddit banned the subreddit for frequent rule-breaking, for antagonizing the company and other communities and for failing to ""meet our most basic expectations"".[108]

In August 2014, Reddit users began sharing a large number of naked pictures of celebrities stolen, using phishing, from their private Apple iCloud accounts.[109][110] A subreddit, r/TheFappening, was created as a hub to share and discuss these stolen photos; the situation was called CelebGate by the media.[111] The subreddit contained most of the images.[112][113] Victims of ""The Fappening"" included high-profile names such as Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.[114][115] Some of the images may have constituted child pornography, as the photos of Liz Lee and McKayla Maroney from the leak were claimed to have been taken when the women were underage, though this remains controversial.[116] The subreddit was closed by Reddit administrators in September 2014. The scandal led to wider criticisms concerning the website's moderation, from The Verge and The Daily Dot.[117][118]

After the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, Reddit banned the ""Watch People Die"" subreddit, dedicated to uploading media depicting real-life deaths of people, after it disseminated links to video of the shooting. The subreddit r/gore was also removed on 15 March 2019. Although previously quarantined for over half a year, the subreddit was totally banned at approximately 17:09 UTC on 15 March 2019, less than a day after the events for violating Reddit's content policy, specifically the policy against ""glorifying or encouraging violence."" Moderators of the subreddit had initially allowed the video to be shared.[119]

r/WPDTalk, a subreddit for discussion on what went on in the r/WatchPeopleDie subreddit, was also taken down.[120]

Following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, members of the subreddit r/findbostonbombers wrongly identified a number of people as suspects, including a 17-year-old track athlete and a 22-year-old Brown University student missing since March.[121] A body reported to be that of the missing Brown student misidentified as a Boston bomber suspect, who had been missing for a month before-hand, was found in Providence River in Rhode Island on 25 April 2013, as reported by the Rhode Island Health Department.[122][123] The cause of death was found to be suicide.[124] The subreddit was later made private.[125]

Reddit general manager Erik Martin later issued an apology for this behavior, criticizing the ""online witch hunts and dangerous speculation"" that took place in these investigation-oriented communities.[126] In September 2013, a similar subreddit dedicated to finding the Navy Yard shooter(s) was banned by the Reddit admins.[127] These events were dramatized in TV shows The Newsroom[128][129] and The Good Wife.[130]

In 2014, the subreddit r/KotakuInAction, whose name mocks Kotaku's perceived liberal bias,[131] was created as one of the main online hubs for participants of the Gamergate controversy.[132][133] Users are warned that by joining KotakuInAction, they will be banned from other subreddits such as r/OffMyChest, r/NaturalHair and r/Rape, the latter of the three being a support forum for survivors of rape that had been targeted for brigading by r/KotakuInAction users.[134]

BuzzFeed's Joseph Bernstein reported that many of KotakuInAction's moderators also moderate other subreddits ""devoted to either the physical and emotional degradation and humiliation of women, or in subreddits devoted to mocking and delegitimizing the arguments and appearances of feminists and ""social justice warriors"".""[131]

In 2016, KotakuInAction became the subject of an academic study done by three members of the Georgia Institute of Technology.[135]

On 12 July 2018, the creator and head moderator of KotakuInAction removed all of the moderators and set the forum to private, alleging that it had become ""infested with racism and sexism"". A Reddit employee restored the forum and its moderators an hour later.[136][137]

Reddit's men's rights subreddit (r/MensRights) was included in a list of twelve websites in the spring 2012 issue (""The Year in Hate and Extremism"") of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report in a section called ""Misogyny: The Sites"". The SPLC reported that ""Although some of the sites make an attempt at civility and try to back their arguments with facts, they are almost all thick with misogynistic attacks that can be astounding for the guttural hatred they express"".[138]

More specific claims were made about r/MensRights in particular, saying that it showed anger ""toward any program designed to help women"", and that the subreddit ""trafficks in various conspiracy theories"", using a moderator's statements as an example of this behavior.[139] Outlets such as The Huffington Post interpreted the report as saying the subreddit was a hate group.[140]

In late March 2012, Mark Potok (the Intelligence Report's editor) was asked in an interview if the SPLC had formally classified r/MensRights as a hate group. His response was that ""We wrote about the subreddit Mens Rights, but we did not list it as a hate group"" and expressed doubt that the SPLC would ever designate the community as a hate group, noting that ""it's a diverse group, which certainly does include some misogynists—but I don't think that's [its basic] purpose"".[141]

Later that year, the SPLC published a statement about the reactions to their report, saying it ""provoked a tremendous response among men's rights activists (MRAs) and their sympathizers"", and ""It should be mentioned that the SPLC did not label MRAs as members of a hate movement; nor did our article claim that the grievances they air on their websites – false rape accusations, ruinous divorce settlements and the like – are all without merit. But we did call out specific examples of misogyny and the threat, overt or implicit, of violence.""[142]

In April 2013, the subreddit was threatened with a shutdown by Reddit admins after r/MensRights subscribers gathered personal information on a supposed blogger of feminist issues, and the subreddit's moderators advised members of the subreddit on how to proceed with this 'doxing' without running afoul of site rules.[143] Later on it was discovered that they had identified the wrong woman, and it has been reported that many death threats had been sent to her school and employment. Georgetown University confirmed that she was not the same person as the blog's author after receiving threatening messages.[143]

In mid-December 2013, users from r/MensRights as well as 4chan spammed the Occidental College Online Rape Report Form with hundreds of false rape reports, following a user's complaint that the form was vulnerable to abuse because of the submitter's ability to be anonymous.[144][145] Around 400 false rape accusations were made by men's rights activists against members of the college, feminists and fictional people.[144]

In April 2014, it was made apparent that moderators of r/technology, a subreddit with 5 million subscribers, were using automatic filters to remove submissions that contained certain keywords, such as ""Aaron Swartz"", ""Tesla"",[146] ""Comcast"", ""NSA"", and ""Snowden"".[147] This ultimately led to community protests, claims of censorship from users, and r/technology losing its default subreddit status.[148][149]

r/TheRedPill is a misogynistic subreddit which promotes male supremacy. It was profiled by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[150] It has been associated with several right-wing movements and the alt-right because of its attacks on feminism and mockery of rape.[151]

It was discovered that a New Hampshire legislator created the subreddit and posted demeaning comments about women. After this discovery, he resigned from office.[152] The New Statesman has described this subreddit as one of the most misogynistic subreddits on Reddit, which aims to radicalize men.[153] Currently, the subreddit is quarantined.[154]

In October 2019, r/BlackPeopleTwitter started requiring users to prove their race before allowing them to comment on links. In order to prove they are not white, a user would have to take a picture of their forearm together with their username. In addition, users who have proved themselves to be black were given a special flair on the subreddit. The result by the subreddit gained recognition from online news sources.[155]

r/FemaleDatingStrategy is a subreddit which has been criticized for its views on transgender women, sex workers, and men. It has been criticized for often objectifying men and treating dating as a game to be won. Women who post on the subreddit asking for dating advice are often given advice that has been described by The Verge as socially and sexually conservative, and oppressive to women.[156]

In accordance with the site's policies on free speech, Reddit's admins say that they do not ban communities solely for featuring controversial content. Reddit's general manager Erik Martin noted that ""having to stomach occasional troll [sub]reddits like r/picsofdeadkids or morally questionable [sub]reddits like r/jailbait are part of the price of free speech on a site like this,"" and that it is not Reddit's place to censor its users.[157] The site's former CEO, Yishan Wong, stated that distasteful subreddits would not be banned because Reddit as a platform should serve the ideals of free speech.[1][158] Critics of this position have argued that Reddit has not been consistent in following its free speech philosophy.[159][160]",mainstream
484,"To the editor: Buried in the article on the doctored video falsely showing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) slurring her words is a chilling comment from a Facebook spokesperson: “We don’t have a policy that stipulates that the information you post on Facebook must be true.”

Few things in the world have sown more chaos than the millions of lies on Facebook. From the bizarre “Pizzagate” conspiracy intended to damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign, to Hindus in India posting fabrications about Muslims slaughtering and eating cows, Facebook has enabled users worldwide to spread hate and mob mentality.

We know the 1st Amendment does not protect shouting “fire!” in a crowded theater. It should also deny protection to the posting of that which creates online stampedes of mass hatred.

Facebook is an integral part of the lives of more than 2 billion people worldwide. It is time to regulate Facebook if Facebook is unwilling to properly regulate itself.

To the editor: Your article quotes a UC Irvine researcher who says that the best way to stop these types of attacks is to make them “not visible.”

This video did not appear on my Facebook feed, and I don’t have Twitter, so I did not hear about it until it was played on the radio — by NPR.

Maybe, the news media of this country can assist in making this “sexist trash” disappear by not putting reports about it on the front page of newspapers.

1146,"It's 40 years since the world became familiar with the word ""Watergate"", as televised hearings of the committee investigating Richard Nixon began. How did the name of an American hotel complex set the standard for labelling controversies?

Editors and social commentators are undeniably fond of a ""-gate"".

The suffix has become so common that it is increasingly used in parody - an admission that the outrage is tongue-in-check.

But recent media furores such as Andrew Mitchell's Plebgate, or Gategate, and David Cameron's Horsegate, show the tag is alive and well as shorthand for scandal.

The original takes its name from the Watergate hotel complex in Washington DC - scene of the burglary which triggered the cover-up, the scandal and the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

""What? Take the last four letters of a previous scandal or hotel and add it on to all future scandals?

""That can't be the system.""

Comedy double-act Mitchell and Webb's satirical sketch brings into focus the irrational logic behind this literary habit, which the Oxford English Dictionary traces back to 1973 - the epicentre of the Watergate scandal - when America's National Lampoon magazine coined Volgagate.

Initially there was a trend for creating clumsy nouns and verbs, ""Watergatery"" and ""Watergating"" appeared in print among others, but only ""-gate"" endured.

New York Times political columnist William Safire, a former Nixon speechwriter, created a trend by coining at least 20 -gates - some say as a way of undermining criticism of his former boss.

France soon had Winegate - a scandal involving chemicals being used to turn vinegar wine into table quality.

An independent inquiry into betting on horse racing, set up by the UK Government in the early 1980s, became Totegate.

Newspapers handed President Bill Clinton a glut of gates, the most famous being Monicagate.

At about the same time, the Royal family faced Squidgygate - referencing the nickname used by an alleged lover of Princess Diana in leaked conversations - and Camillagate.

More recently, Rio Ferdinand's drugs ban became Riogate. Bloodgate referred to fake blood being used to allow a substitution in a rugby union match.

Ian Brookes, consultant editor on the Collins English Dictionary, says -gate was recognised formally as a suffix in its own right in 1991.

""Its usage within journalism is so pervasive that people with no knowledge of the Watergate scandal would have no problem understanding what was meant by a word like Bloodgate,"" he says.

""What is most interesting is that there is no semantic element within the word ""gate"" which means anything about scandal. Most suffixes have some grounding, maybe from Greek or Latin.""

An Italian political scandal in the early 1990s, involving corruption and bribery in Milan, was branded 'Tangentopoli' - tangente for bribe, poli for city.

Bancopoli, Calciopoli and Vallettopoli are some of the many scandals to have followed.

But -gate is a global phenomenon. The Handbook of Morphology, published in 2001, found its use in German, Greek and Hungarian, among others.

Australia had Utegate. And controversy surrounding a Venezuelan entrepreneur's arrival in Argentina with a suitcase full of cash became known as Valijagate - from 'valija', meaning suitcase.

Newspaper columnist John Rentoul, author of the Banned List, which chronicles journalistic jargon and includes -gate, believes the term should be reserved for humour.

Lyinginstategate, for example - referring to squabbling over the Queen Mother's funeral arrangements in 2002 - would still be acceptable.

Pizzagate could qualify too. The term was quickly coined after a post-match scuffle between players of Manchester United and Arsenal.

It reportedly culminated in a stray slice of pizza flying across the tunnel and - in the words of former Arsenal defender Ashley Cole - hitting Sir Alex Ferguson ""straight in the mush"".

Social media users gave Pizzagate a second airing in response to David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson being photographed enjoying an Italian in Davos on the eve of some disappointing economic growth figures.

Gordon Brown found himself at the centre of Biscuitgate in 2009 after apparently refusing to be drawn on his favourite biscuit when quizzed by parents in a live webchat. Bigotgate, in the following year's election campaign, provided an even bigger headache.

""It has become so well-used in the journalistic ecosystem that it is on the edge of cliche and on its way to becoming an idiom,"" says Rentoul.

""Any story that runs for more than a few minutes, and in which further comments or developments are expected, just becomes a -gate for ease of reference.

""I have no objection to its use among consenting adult journalists in conversation, but using it in print just betrays a lack of imagination.""

It also does not really make sense. Watergate is a place, not a scandal about water.

But it is not the first example of a word being crudely disassembled to create a new expression.

The suffix -burger is loaned from hamburger to form cheeseburger or veggie burger - even though a hamburger refers to its origins in Hamburg, Germany, not to a burger made from ham.

Ian Brookes, of Collins, notes that bikini has spawned words like tankini and mankini - even though the swimwear was named after a place, Bikini Atoll. Bollywood and Nollywood use Hollywood.

It may irritate some, but it is nothing new.

And judging by coalgate, guptagate and examgate - used by news outlets within the last week - it is here to stay.

1005,"Authorities are looking to identify the man suspected of purposely starting a fire at the Washington, DC, restaurant at the center of the 'Pizzagate' online conspiracy theory.

Authorities said a small fire was started at Comet Ping Pong in Washington, DC, on January 23 at about 9.20pm.

By the time DC Fire and EMS arrived at the scene, the pizza joint's employees had extinguished the fire that had spread to some of the curtains and window coverings inside, according to NBC Washington.

Investigators later determined that the fire was the result of arson.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) then released two surveillance camera pictures of a man suspected in connection with the fire at Comet Ping Pong.

The man is being described as a white male with blond hair, a mustache and beard, who is between the ages of 25 and 30 years old. In the surveillance pictures, he is wearing a blue and white varsity-style jacket and jeans.

Authorities have not yet stated whether there is any connection between the arson and the 'pizzagate' conspiracy theory, which claims that the restaurant shelters a child sex abuse ring run by Hillary Clinton and her former campaign chief of staff, John Podesta.

There has been no evidence of the so-called abuse, no investigation and no victims who have come forward claiming to have suffered abuse.

The unfounded 'pizzagate' conspiracy made headline news in December 2016 when Edgar Maddison Welch, then 28, of Salisbury, North Carolina, was arrested after he traveled to DC, went to the restaurant and fired multiple shots from his AR-15 assault rifle inside while demanding the the truth about the conspiracy.

Welch pleaded guilty to interstate transportation of a firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon and was sentenced to four years in prison on June 22, 2017.

There were no injuries during the Comet Ping Pong arson.

1063,"On Monday, 42-year-old Isaac Kappyan made an ominous and lengthy Instagram post. Then, he jumped to his death. The Arizona Department of Public Safety has confirmed that Kappy reportedly forced himself off the Transwestern Road bridge onto Interstate 40 where he was struck by a Ford pickup truck.

His post was entitled, “Beware the man has nothing to lose, for he has nothing to protect.” And in it he said, “See the light in others … This lesson has come too late for me, but perhaps it can inspire you. I will be using the remainder of my time on earth to atone for my transgressions, and to seek the light within, in others and myself.”

You can make your own call on the video he made and the situation. He talks about satanic pedophiles, MK Ultra, Operation Mockingbird, Pizzagate, and so much more.

Before jumping off the bridge several bystanders tried to physically restrain him but failed to hold him. There were no other injuries and authorities have now closed their investigation.

1202,"The reviews are in:

Yet “QAnon: An Invitation to the Great Awakening,” a book pushing wacky conspiracy theories, has become an Amazon AMZN, best seller, cracking the top 75 among books sold on the site in recent days, according to NBC News.

The book, which says it was written by a dozen “anonymous Q followers, decoders and citizen journalists known collectively as Where We Go One We Go All (WWG1WGA),” claims that Democrats murder and eat children and that the government created AIDS, polio and Lyme disease. Then there’s the belief that the world is run by a Satanic cabal led by Hillary Clinton.

There’s more. So much more. But we’ll leave it there.

QAnon emerged from the dark corners of the internet and into the national spotlight thanks primarily to supporters of Donald Trump who would show up at his rallies wearing clothes and holding signs referencing the “Q” conspiracy.

Key Words:Hillary Clinton says ‘Pizzagate’ shows how fake-news ‘epidemic’ puts real lives at risk

Mike Rothschild, a conspiracy-theory expert, told NBC that the book is just another way for the QAnon movement to cash in on its gullible followers, calling it “a bold new step in the endless grift at the heart of Q.”

Nevertheless, the book keeps selling and racking up questionable glowing reviews, which Jason Kint, CEO of the trade association Digital Content Next, chalks up to manipulation and the lack of oversight on Amazon’s part.

“To be clear, they absolutely shouldn’t be censoring the availability of books like this,” Kite explained to NBC. “But the fact we’re left only with the publisher’s own description of the book and a clearly gamed set of 5-star reviews — how is the average shopper supposed to know this is toxic garbage?”",mainstream
856,"A New Jersey government worker has been arrested on child pornography charges after he was caught using the same pedophile code words that John Podesta used in his leaked emails.

According to the Acting United States Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick, 37-year-old Stephen Salamak, of Lodi, New Jersey was arrested by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) after placing an advert on Craigslist requesting “cheese pizza.”

According to an internal FBI document leaked by WikiLeaks, “cheese pizza” is pedophile code for “very young girl.” This pedophile code word – among others – appears liberally in John Podesta’s emails, also released by WikiLeaks in the latter stages of the 2016 presidential election.

While Stephen Salamak, a lowly New Jersey government employee, was arrested after his use of the term tipped off law enforcement to his alleged crimes, John Podesta remains free.

Salamak was charged with receiving child pornography according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. Speculation that the corrections officers advert was related to Pizzagate has now begun to circulate across forums and social media.The criminal complaint against Salamak as reported by local news Press of Atlantic City states: “In May, an undercover law enforcement officer responded to a Craigslist ad, placed by Salamak, seeking “Woman/Moms that are into Cheese Pizza.”

The Goldwater reports: The complaint said Salamak communicated with the undercover officer and requested photos of an 8-year-old child. In July, authorities executed a search of Salamak’s email account, finding he communicated with multiple people about pornography and pedophilia.”

A search warrant of Salamak’s home was executed on Thursday, where admitted to authorities “Cheese Pizza” was a reference to child pornography, he knowing received emails containing child porn and knowingly communicated with various individuals regarding child pornography and pedophilia.”

216,"The United Nations, heavily subsidized by U.S. taxpayers’ dollars, has faced a widespread child sexual abuse problem for years and reacted with little more than silence.

EDITOR’S NOTE: Have you ever wondered why, after a disaster like a hurricane or a tsunami in a third-world or developing country, that so many “charitable organizations” like the UN and the Clinton Foundation rush to go there? It’s to help the victims, right? Wrong. It’s so they can go there and exploit them while they are helpless, with a special focus on the children. NTEB has spoken to numerous child sex trafficking prevention groups in Haiti who have told us that the main customers of child sex trafficking establishments are United States congressmen and senators. The United Nations “peacekeepers” are raping children around the world, and they are protected by the UN so they will never face trial. This is what YOUR tax dollars are funding. Just thought you’d like to know.

On February 28, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres confirmed that UN peacekeepers and civilian staff faced 145 allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse impacting on 311 victims in 2016 alone. There are nearly 40 cases so far in 2017. Many of the victims, by the UN’s own admission, are children.

As one 11-year-old child put it, “I didn’t have breasts yet, but he still raped me.” It is the one indefensible act. Child rape.

Even the UN recognises that these numbers, while huge, are likely to be the tip of the iceberg and represent only the crimes that have been reported, involving mainly just one part of the UN: Peacekeeping.

These numbers are a small proportion of the sex and child rape crimes committed by UN staff and peacekeepers over at least the last two decades.

Neither the sex scandals of the UN in the Bosnian War dramatized in the 2010 film Whistleblower nor the long-running “Food for Sex” scandals of the early 2000s. are covered in these figures. What is worse, decision makers have known this for years but have failed to crack down.

A Save the Children report over a decade ago found abuse at all age levels “from 8 to 18,” though the victims older than twelve were identified as being “regularly involved in ‘selling sex.’” The Save report went on to say that, among the children interviewed, “all of the respondents clearly stated that they felt that the scale of the problem affected over half of the girls in their locations.”

The outbreak of such heinous activity at the UN highlights just how vulnerable the victims are. Faced with legal safeguards in the United States and Western countries, evil men have found that it is easy to gain access to children in developing countries. People in power know this, so much so that since 1999 authorities have warned that problem of paedophiles in the aid world is on a level with sex tourism.

As Western countries have cracked down on paedophilia, many predatory paedophiles have targeted the developing world to find child victims. An easy way to gain access to children in the developing world is to join a children’s charity. It is disgusting, but logical once you are told.

UN officials know this, yet have failed to act decisively.

The UN uses legal and sovereign immunity claims to prevent prosecution. The UN chooses not to waive immunity and therefore uses this legal fiction to protect child rapists rather than the children.

For at least 20 years, the leadership of the UN has known and failed to effectively act. Former Secretary General Kofi Annan listed his failure to act on the paedophilia of UN staff in his ten years as Secretary General as one of his regrets, and immediate past Secretary General Ban Ki Moon has acknowledged not enough has been done.

People have been using soft words about paedophilia in the UN and large NGOs for decades. None of this is secret. None of this is surprising. But never has pressure been seriously applied for something to be done. The current Secretary General proposed a four-part strategy putting “the rights and dignity for victims at the forefront of UN efforts.”

“I fully recognize that no magic wand exists to end the problem of sexual exploitation and abuse,” Guterres said. “Nevertheless, I believe that we can dramatically improve how the United Nations addresses this scourge.”

“Dramatically improve” are weasel words. We should be stronger. We should stamp this out and we could start with the language.

For example, the UN used “sexual abuse” to describe the 14-year-old child, together with her 18-year-old friend, set upon by UN peacekeepers near Bambari Airport in Central African Republic late in 2015.

This is not “sexual abuse.” This is gang rape of a child. Call it for what it is.

Approximately 28 percent of UN peacekeeping operations, and a quarter of all UN operations, are funded by the United States’ taxpayer. The U.S. taxpayer is effectively funding child rape. By withholding funds, the United States could stop the rape, yet no previous U.S. government has had the courage to say “Stop, no more.” It is time the U.S. government put an end to this.

It is time the U.S. government said to the UN: “fix the problem.” If the UN does not fix it, then the US should stop funding it. U.S. taxpayers should not fund child rape. It is that simple. source",conspiracy
1341,"The cast of Guardians of the Galaxy has published a collective open letter in support of director James Gunn, who was fired by Disney earlier in July for a series of offensive tweets posted a decade to six years ago, which included jokes about paedophilia, rape, and molestation.

In the days following his firing, some members of the cast had issued individual statements that directly or indirectly referenced the event. Dave Bautista, who plays Drax, was the first to address the situation, calling him ""one of the most loving, caring, good natured people I have ever met"" and noting he wasn't okay ""with what’s happening to him"". Michael Rooker, who plays Yondu, deleted his Twitter account in solidarity and disgust.

Zoe Saldana (Gamora), Karen Gillan (Nebula), and Chris Pratt (Star-Lord) opted for more cautious, broader approaches, talking about their love for the Guardians of the Galaxy ""family"", while Pratt quoted a passage from the Bible about being ""quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger"".

But now, nine members of the cast including Bradley Cooper (voice of Rocket), Sean Gunn (mo-cap for Rocket), Vin Diesel (voice of Groot), and Pom Klementieff (Mantis) in addition to the aforementioned have come together for a joint statement that calls for Gunn's rehiring, and addresses ""the growing political divide"" in the US and asks people to ""ease up on character assassinations and stop weaponising mob mentality"".

Those phrases are likely referring to the people responsible for resurfacing Gunn's old tweets, in this case American right-wing media personality and conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich, who was involved in popularising the false theory ""Pizzagate"" to such an extent that it led to a man open fire with his assault rifle in a Washington, DC pizzeria.

And new mom Shay Mitchell proved her Pinterest-mom credentials as she posted a picture to mark daughter Atlas turning a month old on Monday.

Dollface actress Shay, 32, celebrated the infant's first month with a snap of her little one lying on a pizza box with a single slice next to her.

She captioned it: 'My Super Sweet One Month Birthday extravaganza was a success - we had trapeze artists, champagne fountains, and zebras.....just kidding. We had milk and naps.'

Shay welcomed daughter Atlas with Canadian actor beau Matte Babel, 39, last month and has been turning to her former Pretty Little Liars co-star Troian Bellisario when she needs advice.

'She has been the person I've gone to for the most advice, obviously having a daughter of her own,' Shay told Entertainment Tonight at the Revolve Awards at Goya Studios in Los Angeles.

'I'm the luckiest person in the world. She is not only such an incredible person, but the best mom ever So to have her give me advice is, like, more than I could ever ask for.'

Troian, 34, is a year ahead of her in terms of baby experience as her little girl Aurora, whom she shares with her Suits actor husband Patrick J. Adams, 38, arrived in October 2018.

Shay continued: 'The other [Pretty Little Liars] girls will definitely be meeting her soon.'

542,"Innocent or not, Mr. Dawson’s videos contain precisely the type of viral misinformation that YouTube now says it wants to limit. And its effort raises an uncomfortable question: What if stemming the tide of misinformation on YouTube means punishing some of the platform’s biggest stars?

A representative for Mr. Dawson did not respond to a request for comment. A YouTube spokeswoman, Andrea Faville, said: “We recently announced that we’ve started reducing recommendations of borderline content or videos that could misinform users in harmful ways. This is a gradual change and will get more and more accurate over time.”

Part of the problem for platforms like YouTube and Facebook — which has also pledged to clean up misinformation that could lead to real-world harm — is that the definition of “harmful” misinformation is circular. There is no inherent reason that a video questioning the official 9/11 narrative is more dangerous than a video asserting the existence of U.F.O.s or Bigfoot. A conspiracy theory is harmful if it results in harm — at which point it’s often too late for platforms to act.

Take, for example, Mr. Jones’s assertion that the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 was a hoax perpetrated by gun control advocates. That theory, first dismissed as outrageous and loony, took on new gravity after Mr. Jones’s supporters began harassing the grieving parents of victims.

Or take Pizzagate, a right-wing conspiracy theory that alleged that Hillary Clinton and other Democrats were secretly running a child-sex ring. The theory, which was spread in a variety of videos on YouTube and other platforms, might have remained an internet oddity. But it became a menace when a believer showed up at a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., with an assault rifle, vowing to save the children he believed were locked in the basement.

To its credit, YouTube has taken some minor steps to curb misinformation. Last year, it began appending Wikipedia blurbs to videos espousing certain conspiracy theories, and changed the way it handles search results for breaking news stories so that reliable sources are given priority over opportunistic partisans. And last summer, it was among the many social networks to bar Mr. Jones and Infowars.

“And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.” Mark 9:42 (KJV)

Below you will find the segment of Creepy Joe’s interview on ‘The View from earlier today, I suggest you watch it. At the bottom of this article you will see videos of Creepy Joe fondling little girls, touching them in unspeakable ways, and rubbing up against them from behind as his face beams with excitement. As someone who has experienced this type of behaviour from an old male pedophile when I was a child, I have decided that I will speak for those children who are powerless to speak for themselves, and whose parents are too afraid and too cowardly to do themselves.

You like to call yourself a ‘tough guy‘, right Creepy Joe? Good, let’s see how tough you really are.

FROM THE HILL: Joe Biden defended his behavior as innocent and described his public displays of affection as a means of connecting with people on the campaign trail. The former vice president was pressed on several occasions to directly apologize to the women who said he made them uncomfortable. Instead, he apologized if there was a misunderstanding about his intentions.

“I’m really sorry if what I did in talking to them in trying to console, if in fact they took it in a different way,” Biden said. “It’s my responsibility to make sure that I bend over backwards to understand how not to do that.”

Joe Biden had previously said he never “intended” to make anyone uncomfortable and that he’d be more mindful of women’s personal space. But he’s also joked about the matter — after hugging a man at a union rally earlier this month, Biden reassured the crowd he had permission to do so.

Biden officially launched his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday. He and former Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lead in most of the early polling of the race. READ MORE

297,"The Ruling Cabal uses USG law enforcement agencies, Intel agencies, and the many other agencies of the USG to oppress We The People and to oppress truth. This is all done in order to protect their own interests instead of ours as is their Constitutional mandate. The Cabal does all this unconstitutionally and in abject violation of the thousands of Federal Laws they conceived themselves and paid their cutouts in Congress to pass. The Cabal has been deploying false-flag terror to militarize the American police so that they can be used to oppress We The People and generate massive societal chaos and distrust of authority. This is part of their age old plan to destroy the American Constitutional Republic. No greater hypocrisy ever existed. This massive collection of federal law makes it easy for them to indict anyone at almost any time, but they are exempt from these laws due to their powerful control of the agencies that enforce these laws. Most federal grand juries are cherry-picked to be easily manipulated by crooked US Attorney prosecutors they could indict a grapefruit. Of course, no judge ever informs any jury about their Constitutional right to declare a defendant innocent if they believe the law is unjust or unconstitutional or allows anyone to pass leaflets declaring such outside the courthouse on public sidewalks. The USA was transformed into a corporation in 1887 and all judges are actually corporate enforcers of corporate law whether they realize it or not. In 1933 the USA, Inc. was declared bankrupt and the assets of all US citizens were declared collateral on the debt transforming us into chattel of the Cabal. US Attorneys are licensed under British Barrister Law and operate as extensions of the City of London whether they know it or not. American licensed attorneys carry the title Esquire after their name which is illegal according to the US Constitution. Widespread, massive oppression of We The People by the Cabal using USG assets. This widespread, massive oppression of We The People by the Cabal includes the oppression of whistle-blowers, dissonants, truth-tellers and anyone they deem to have become or could become an obstruction to the implementation of their Luciferian Globalist NWO Plan. The Ruling Cabal has now activated its long-term Globalist NWO Luciferian agenda to reduce the earths population of humans by 90%, and has deployed hundreds of soft-kill and hard-kill programs to do so. The final stage of their Globalist NWO plan involves the complete elimination of humans, with the substitution of their own manufactured mechanical/biological androids with their own implanted memories. They believe this will allow them to live forever. Certainly, this is one of the greatest if not the greatest mass delusions ever adopted by a large criminal group, in this case the head of the Pyramid of Power also known as the 13 families, the Illuminati, the Old Black Nobility, the Babylonian Talmudics or the Rothschild Khazarian Mafia (RKM). Hard kill means are engineered weather disasters using high tech secret means known since at least 1950, and the engineering of perpetual wars with high death counts and lots of wounded and disabled. Hard-kill methods include engineered perpetual wars and the targeting of US Soldiers with the radiation scatter from depleted uranium weapons to make them sick, to commit suicide in mass. DU also destroys their genetic heritage and cripples Americas ability to defend itself. Soft-kill methods include secret bio warfare to keep lots of folks sick with colds and flu to keep cold remedy sales high and this becomes hard-kill for many especially including geriatrics, reducing their population significantly. Top secret very sophisticated mind-kontrol and chemical/biological control systems have been deployed against American soldiers deployed to the Mideast to create approximately 22 suicides a day after returning home. These means included purposefully contaminated, experimental vaccines given to our troops, exposure to DU, and very sophisticated remote entrainment by psychotronics designed to produce suicidal unremitting ideation. Order out of chaos­The Cabals motto As the Cabal creates chaos, war, mass death, mass suffering and loss and hell on earth and through very crafty means, it is able to convert these problems to more and more money and power for themselves and their cutouts. The Cabal creates social and environmental problems so big that they can easily convince the public that only the government has the means to resolve them. The most evil practices of the Cabal include engineered mass-death by staged wars, and their ritualistic satanic black mass pedophilia, torture, sacrifice and cannibalism of infants and young children. Pizzagate is all true and is just the tip of the iceberg of a worldwide pedogate run by the Cabal. Hollywood is run by the Gay Mafia according to insiders and some of the richest most popular producers rape young actors at gunpoint and threaten to kill their families if they talk. Undeniable facts are now being revealed to the public repetitively and these disclosures cannot be stopped and will themselves result in many of the high and mighty falling. Millions are displaced from their ancestral lands through engineered wars and other complex covert means, all done to restructure European societies into one that has been Globalized. Destroying every nations borders, culture and language is an absolute necessity if the Cabal is to be able to attain its Globalist NWO Luciferian system. Cabal deployment of soft-kill and hard-kill operations to thin the human herd. Pilots and former military have come forth and gone public that the USG is using various black op deniable entities to use specially equipped aircraft to spray toxic chemicals into the sky Many of the soft-kill methods used to thin the herd are top secret high technology such as contaminated vaccines. One now well documented example of this is the polio vaccine and many other vaccines which also contain the SV40 monkey virus. SV40 is now known to be a precursor for about 40% of the soft-tissue cancers according to some top pathologists. Recently numerous physicians and medical researchers have discovered that a very powerful toxic cancer-causing substance (Nagalese) has been added to vaccines and foods to create a lot of different types of cancers. These doctors also discovered an antagonist that quickly stops the cancer. News reports suggest that every one of these doctors has been arkencided or murdered in obviously suspicious circumstances. Perhaps these hit-teams are deployed to protect the cancer industry and Big Pharma? Ethyl Mercury, one of the most neurotoxic substances known to man is still present in many vaccines and is not needed, present only as a manufacturing convenience and to dumb-down young children, like Fluoride added to the water and present in many processed foods and in most toothpaste. A peer reviewed study from a top university out east showed that on average Fluoride in the water reduced IQ in children at least 8 points. Note that I am not anti-vaccine, but am against the use of contaminated vaccines and needless, excessive vaccination which is the current practice. Two vaccines which are needed are the Tetanus vaccine (without pertussis, a dangerous vaccine in the American version) and Rabies vaccine, both real life savers. Some wholistic doctors claim that taking large doses before and after a single vaccination can pull out most of the needless contaminants, but each person needs to research this. It has been reported from insiders who became whistle-blowers that various quite sophisticated top secret psychotronic means have also been deployed to soft-kill (such as the Venus gun allegedly used to murder Andrew Breitbart). These advanced highly sophisticated psychotronic devices are also often used to torture, oppress and punish whistle-blowers and anyone believed to be a current threat or a likely future threat. This is not rumor it is now well documented fact with many witnesses. I have personally swept homes of some victims and found exceedingly high levels of targeted EMF present. How does the Cabal profit from the wars and chaos which they engineer? About 66 Cabal families own the largest blocks of stocks in the defense industry and COL franchise Banking which makes huge profits off of wars that the Cabal orders its Intel cutouts to create. The Cabal creates an unending stream of international and national threats so large that supposedly only they have the size and power to resolve them. Their main source of income is the massive profits their corporations make solving the very problems they spent years before creating. But of course they claim that only they can resolve them and that they need We The People to give up more and more rights and provide more and more tax money. Hows that for a self-perpetuating racket? That is why Israel and the CIA created their secret mercenary army ISIS et al, with the Saudis paying for most of it. Now that ISIS has been defeated, the first major defeat of the CIA since the Bay of Pigs and the first major defeat for the Likudists ever, the Ruling Cabal (aka RKM) seems to be under direct fire itself for the very first time by the rest of the world. How did the USA ever get into this mess where our federal government and its agencies and assets were hijacked by the large secret Ruling Cabal and turned against us, declaring a secret war of the USG against We The People? The visible US government which is located in the District of Columbia is ceremonial only. The real power that runs the USG lies in the invisible government, best called the Secret Shadow Government (SSG). And in recent years deep state researchers have come to know for certain that the SSG is actually run by the worlds largest organized crime cabal run out of the City of London. Insiders call this massive but subterranean organized crime cabal the Rothschild Khazarian Mafia (RKM), and many call it the International Banksters. Those on the inside of the Cabal or at its periphery call it the Money-changers. Long ago, in 1913 the USG was hijacked by the City of London (COL) private central Fiat Banksters who seized control of our monetary system. These COL Banksters removed the use of real Constitutional money backed by Gold and Silver and substituted their FIAT debt-notes to lend us citizen peons to use at pernicious usury (rates set by them), all the while pretending it was real Constitutional money. These COL Banksters could create any amount of money they needed at will through various simple to complex hidden means, charge it all back to US Citizen taxpayers as loans to them an charge them interest on that money unknowing borrowed. This unlimited ability to create any amount of money needed and spend it any way they want allowed these COL Banksters to get complete control over all the US mainstream media. hey were thus able to consolidate and transform American Major Mass Media into an illegal News and Media Cartel comprised of six international Media Corporations which these Banksters completely control. Why hasnt the US Congress put a stop to this worlds largest financial fraud, the Federal Reserve System (FRS) which is a for profit, private corporate franchise of the City of London and is no more federal than Federal Express? The answer is quite simple. The FRS serves as an unlimited elastic checkbook for the US Congress. It allows members of Congress to spend whatever they want to please the special interests who give them massive campaign funds for re-election, provides lucrative board positions, speaking arrangements with fat honorariums, and often large and very secret set aside allocations in numbered accounts in Caribbean offshore banks. Most members of Congress come in with modest means and leave as multi-millionaires. What are they selling for such massive gains while claiming to serve the US citizen? They are serving and selling services to special interests while lying through their teeth to their constituents and pretending to serve them. Members of the US Congress are a pack of lying, bought-off sociopathic secret criminals who have sold out their country for mammon and violated RICO, espionage laws and many others at will, with no exposure or accountability. How could this be so you might ask? First it is important to note that every member of Congress (except one, Representative Walter Jones) has signed the AIPAC Loyalty Oath to Israel, agreeing to place the interests of Israel first even before the interests of the USA. Folks, this is treason and secret espionage against America. Representative Cynthia McKinney fully exposed this after she refused to sign this treasonous AIPAC agreement and paid the price by being illegally prevented from winning her next election. She was illegally redistricted out of her area and her opponent was given vast funds, making it impossible for her to win. Thanks to the worldwide Internet, the New Gutenberg Press, the swamp is being exposed and many corrupt, evil, pedophile, satanic politicians and insiders are now being dethroned. The FBI is now being exposed for the criminal, treasonous enterprise it always was. Insiders have always known that the FBIs job was to protect banks and Banksters and covering up Cabal crimes and the Satanic Pedophile Network while putting on a fake but appealing public image. And the CIA is now being fully exposed as an evil rogue action-agent of the Ruling Cabal, that continually evokes national security as a false cloak to cover their unimaginable evils and engineering of foreign terror and staged wars. More and more folks learn everyday that the CIA set up and runs the drug cartels in South America and is the worlds largest drug trafficker, all done to raise off the books money for black ops and buying influence from politicians. Like many lower level FBI agents, most CIA employees know none of this and have mundane Intel collection jobs. It is the evil Directorate of Operations that does these unimaginably evil crimes, like its assassination of JFK, RFK and MLK and working with Israel and Saudi Arabia to set up their private mercenary army called ISIS. Insiders have always known that the FBI Division 5 has always secretly set up and run all US domestic terror ops, creating the need for massive new USG expenditures and the unconstitutional taking of more and more of the rights of We The People. Historically the Ruling Cabal (the RKM) has just been too powerful to defeat. Now thanks to the Internet (best referred to as the New Gutenberg Press) and thousands of insiders who are coming clean and becoming whistle-blowers, the Cabal is now under attack on many fronts in a very powerful information war against them. This New Gutenberg Press has caused massive populism to emerge inside America and other nations too and is now unremitting and itself is forming a new counterattack on the Ruling Cabal. This new counter attack on the Cabal is also aided by break-away groups that run the Russian Federation, China and many of their new trade partners and defense allies. But the most powerful and important part of the attack against the Cabal at all levels is now coming from a certain deep-black faction in the Secret Space War Program that is both unaccountable and unacknowledged even within the defense contractor it is located within. The Satanic Ruling Cabal has no specific knowledge of what this deep-black faction is, who comprises it or the incredible technology it has now deployed against the Cabal. This deep-black faction has gained the technology to access all hard-drives, on or off, can eavesdrop using electrical wiring, windows or nothing at all but remote sensing devices, many space-based. Essentially, there is no longer going to be anymore secrecy at all. This deep-black cell has the ability to access and deploy all secrets to bring down any Cabal member they want and can easily use such means to coerce any Major Mass Media magnate to publish any story they want, and can quite easily now manipulate any member of Congress, the USG, or any corporation to resign when ordered to do so. Now ponder this reality. The Cabal has traditionally used the USG and its agencies that it hijacked as tools to coerce, abuse, punish and oppress We The People at will and to suppress all truth. In reality the Cabal has been fighting a secret war against We The People and all humans by deploying the USG assets it has hijacked and now controls. Paradoxically, right now the Cabal itself is being covertly attacked by a far more powerful technologically superior force that they cannot identify or protect themselves against. This is called by some Cosmic Justice or what goes around comes around back at you. Some just call it bad Karma. Yes, in this case what goes around has come around, back at these evil Ruling Cabal perps who are now outclassed on many fronts by a secret enemy they do not know and one they cannot understand. Stay tuned and watch the high and mighty fall one by one. The Democratic party is now being destroyed and will never recover. After a while the Republican party too will be destroyed and will never recover. What will replace these parties? Best guess is that it will be a new populist party filled with folks that are sick and tired of the USG being used as a cash trough to feed the DC special interests; tired of the USG and its agencies being used to oppress We The People, while continually violating the US Constitution and the very laws itself created and passed. If you want to learn more about what is likely behind this new form of Justice and where it is all going, do some research on the history of the Gutenberg Press, how the Internet is the New Gutenberg Press, and the coming new Cosmic Fascism which I have predicted is now on the way.",conspiracy
659,"A right-wing conspiracy theorist has been stripped of her Twitter verification after she posted photos of Chrissy Teigen and John Legend's daughter and accused them of being part of a celebrity pedophile ring.

Liz Crokin, who has 50,000 Twitter followers and says she is an investigative journalist, posted the photos last week of 20-month-old Luna dressed in various costumes including a pineapple, hotdog and Alice in Wonderland.

Crokin also pointed out that Teigen had used a pizza emoji on one of her Snapchat photos of her daughter, linking her to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that claimed Hillary Clinton was using a Washington pizza restaurant to run a child sex trafficking ring.

An outraged Teigen took to social media on Saturday to share screenshots of some of Crokin's tweets and to slam Twitter for verifying the alt-right user's account.

After a series of fiery tweets from Teigen and her husband John Legend - including some that threatened legal action - a disgruntled Crokin revealed on Saturday night that Twitter had removed her coveted blue verification tick.

'Twitter just unverified my account thanks to @chrissyteigen. That's OK cuz I care more about saving kids than I do about a blue checkmark!' Crokin tweeted.

Teigen responded to the news by tweeting: 'Praise the Twitter lords.'

'1000 people will tell you not to give them attention, to ignore it, who cares they're crazy, etc. Don't ignore it. Tired of letting these people get away with this s**t. Thank you, @Twitter.'

Earlier on Saturday, Tiegen had called out the social media giant for allowing Crokin to be verified - a sign a source can be trusted - and questioned how she could have so many followers.

'Thank you, Twitter, for verifying somebody who is essentially accusing me (with pictures of my daughter) of child abuse and pedophilia to their 50,000 followers,' Tiegen wrote.

The entire ordeal was sparked when Tiegen first drew attention to Crokin's tweets, saying she was disturbed by the conspiracy theorist's thoughts related to her family.

'Alright. I debated saying something about this but I'm pretty disturbed over here. The fact that there are people with these...thoughts...is really scary,' her first tweet on the issue read.

'...apparently dressing my daughter as Alice in Wonderland and a hot dog and having a pizza emoji on Snapchat has to do with pizzagate and being uhhhh darksided. Holy s**t That thread is wild. Enjoy.

'Yeah yeah it's 'just Twitter' but I'm pretty sure this *sick* person is saying we are darksided pizzagate pedophiles who traffic our daughter. Ummmmm this is really scary s**t.'

The Pizzagate theory is a widely discredited allegation that high-ranking Democrat officials were involved in human trafficking - including a child sex abuse ring - via a Washington DC pizza establishment called Comet Ping Pong.

The theory compelled a North Carolina man to show up at the pizza shop armed with a gun and fire off three shots as searched for the so-called abuse ring.

Tiegen then added: 'But if I dressed Luna up as Alice, wouldn't I be on their side and 'following the white rabbit'?? Why would I post it? What does a hot dog symbolize? Why would I willingly choose a pizza if I were in a secret pizza cult? Why am I trying to even make sense of this still please help.'

The pregnant model demanded an apology from Crokin and threatened to sue after the conspiracy theorist started trying to justify her claims.

'Chrissy you run in circle with people who rape, torture & traffic kids. This is a fact, I expose sex trafficking for a living,' Crokin tweeted.

'What's not OK is trafficking kids as sex slaves which is rampant in Hollywood. Why don't you use your platform to educate people?' she said in a follow up tweet.

Legend also weighed in on the very public fight telling Crokin: 'You need to take my family's name out of your mouth before you get sued.'

The Twitter spat sparked a response from former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton who reached out to Tiegen on Saturday to offer words of support.

'Chrissy, sending you & beautiful Luna a huge hug. It is awful & never ok when people threaten or demean any child. I’ve lost count of the Twitter accounts who’ve threatened Charlotte with #FGM (female genital mutilation). While I never bother to report threats against me, I now report every one against her,' Clinton tweeted.

Teigen tweeted back in response: 'I feel silly even worrying about this in comparison to the magnitude of slander and threats you and your family have dealt with for decades. These people are truly sick and scary. Love to you, Charlotte and Marc!!'",mainstream
1105,"WASHINGTON — A North Carolina man who fired an assault rifle inside a District of Columbia restaurant during his investigation of a conspiracy theory dubbed “pizzagate” was sentenced Thursday to four years in prison.

U.S. District Judge Kentanji B. Jackson said that while no one was injured when Edgar Maddison Welch fired his weapon inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant on Dec. 4, his actions “literally left psychological wreckage.”

Welch acknowledged as part of a guilty plea in March that he entered the restaurant with an AR-15 and a revolver. He said he drove to the restaurant from North Carolina to investigate unfounded internet rumors about Democrats harboring child sex slaves there.

The judge said Welch “forged ahead” with an “ill-conceived plot” even though others urged him to abandon it. If Welch believed children were being harmed, he should have notified law enforcement, the judge said.

This election cycle saw its fair share of so-called “fake news.” On December 4, an armed man walked into a Washington, DC, pizza joint, claiming he needed to investigate a story he had heard: that Hillary Clinton and her former campaign manager were hosting a child sex ring there. Hari Sreenivasan speaks with The Washington Post’s Marc Fisher about how and why this fiction spread as fact.

Welch’s attorney had asked for a sentence of 1 and a half years in prison. Prosecutors wanted 4 and a half years.

Welch spoke briefly to apologize, saying he realized that his words “cannot undo or change what already happened.”

His mother, father, sister and fiancée were in the courtroom.

Two Comet Ping Pong workers and owner James Alefantis spoke before sentencing. Alefantis called “pizzagate” a “viscous web of lies” and said many people had suffered because of Welch’s actions.

862,"Pres. Donald Trump has been in office for eight months and it appears that his administration is witnessing a fundamental reorganization. The “radical” proto-nationalist wing, represented by Steve Bannon, got him elected and is now being pushed out of power. It is being replaced by the more “establishment” wing, one anchored in a coalition between the military bureaucracy and Wall Street – and, apparently, supported by his family.

Almost every day, Trump loudly proclaims some “fantastic” accomplishment, allegedly fulfilling yet another campaign promise to “make American great again.” Nevertheless, the next day some new revelation, impromptu statement or Tweet dealing with racial nationalism, Russia or the Afghanistan war undercuts his questionable accomplishment. How long will Americans, especially Trump’s supporters, believe his hokum?

Trump has not faced a real crisis, whether domestic or international. His first and only misadventure took place in May and involved the failed attack by Navy SEAL Team 6 at a questionable Al-Qaeda camp in Yemen. One SEAL and 30 Yemeni were killed.

But what would Trump do if North Korea got more provocative?; if Afghanistan collapsed?; if the EU broke up? What would he do if the domestic economy seriously sputtered like it did under Bush-II, culminating in another – and more severe -- version of the Great Recession? More troubling, what would he do if a serious terrorist attack on the order of 9/11 took place?

Trump’s tag-team of core staff, principle Cabinet members and the military-intelligence apparatus have likely developed a series of contingency plans to respond to a whole host of possible events.

Over the next year or so, pressures may will mount and Trump’s initial round of supporters, notably working-class whites and Congressional Republicans, may distance themselves -- ideologically and politically -- from his leadership. International pressures can be expected to mount as globalization reorganizes capitalism.

But what would happen if, faced with a serious challenge, Trump statements or decisions (e.g., firing special counsel Robert Mueller) became still-more extreme and fueled a further decline in his popular support? Would Trump think the unthinkable? Would he consider ordering a covert domestic “terrorist” attack to reassert political authority?

It’s useful to a possible conspiracy action by Trump is presented as an historical possibility, not a likely action. Without supporting conspiracy theories, it is useful for Americans to understand the place of federal conspiracies in U.S. foreign and domestic policies. A lot more questionable “stuff” is going on than an average Americans knows about; its kept hidden because people would be up in arms if they knew.

As many have shown, there really is a secret government at work while elected officials occupy the public performance stage. And, since Kennedy, none’s been a better showman – commander-in-distraction -- than Trump.

Americans love conspiracy theories and the 2016 election was chockfull of good whoppers. The Russians sought to subvert the election, releasing revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign. Trump still insists that five million fraudulent ballots were cast for Clinton.

“Pizzagate” was a tall tale that claimed Clinton was somehow involved with a child sex-trafficking ring run out of theComet Ping Pong, a Washington, DC, pizza joint. But this conspiracy turned out to have sharp teeth. In October 2016, a 28-y/o white male Trump supporter from North Carolinatook offense and shot up the place; the perpetrator has a criminal record that includes two drug-possession charges and owned an AR-15 rifle, a .38-caliber revolver and a shotgun.

It’s hard to tell if any of the 2016 whoppers will be remembered in a decade or more from now. Among some of the more recent popular conspiracy theories are the following.
• The 9/11 attacks was preventable. The 9/11 Commission reports that a half-dozen “operational failures” contributed to the attacks and a recent poll found that more than half of Americas (54.3%) “agree or strongly agree” that the U.S. government is concealing what they know about the attacks.
• The Kennedy assassination was not a lone-wolf operation. TheHouse of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinationswas established in 1976 to investigate the killings of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1979, it issued its final report and its findings were shocking: King was likely killed by a lone gunman but as part of a conspiracy; Kennedy was probably assassinated by a conspiracy involving the mob and (possibly) the CIA.
• The Iran-Contra Affair served national-security ends. In 1985-’86, Pres. Ronald Reagan authorized scheme to secretly trade weapons for U.S. hostages in Iran; Oliver North poorly managed the operation in support of the Contras then battling the Cuban-backed Nicaraguan Sandinistas.
• The FBI and CIA does not engage in state-sanctioned assassinations. In 1975, Sen. Frank Church (D-ID) chaired of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities investigating the FBI and CIA. It revealed that the FBI used questionable (if not illegal) intelligence-gathering practices from simple bugging to the use of undercover agents and questionable informers, bugging); it acknowledged the CIA’s role in the overthrowing the governments of Salvador Allende in Chile and Mohammad Mossadegh in Iran, among of political leaders across the globe.

One cannot conclude this list of popular conspiracy theories without identifying aliens, extra-terrestrials, and the Air Force’s Area 51 in New Mexico as among the most popular – and these “aliens” are not from south of the boarder, but another dimension of space/time.

During the post-WW-II era, numerous U.S. presidents approved -- and agents of the government committed -- assassinations and targeted killings of people identified as threats to the national interest. These actions have taken place both internationally and domestically, most often implemented by the CIA, military units and the FBI.

In “Assassination Nation,” Doug Noble identifies the following presidents as playing an active role in the killings – and attempted killings -- of foreign leaders: Eisenhower approved the assassination of Patrice Lumumba (1961); Kennedy approved the killing of Ngo Dinh Diem (1963) and FidelCastro (repeated failed attempts); Nixon approved the Chilean coup and, thus, Allende’s death (1973); George H. Bush approved the killing of Saddam Hussein (2006); and Obama ordered the killing of Muammar Gaddafi (2011) and Osama bin Laden (2011). These state-sponsored killings, really acts of war, were executed by the CIA or a military unit like SEAL Team 6.

Noble exhaustively assesses the roles of U.S. agencies in “neutralizing” those identified as no longer serving the national interests. Among these campaigns were the Phoenix Program during the Vietnam War; the Army’s Project X in South America; and Army’s School of Americas (SOA) role training mass murderers and orchestrated coups in Chile, Peru, Panama, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico.

Domestically, the FBI established COINTELPRO (counter-intelligence program) in 1956 to investigate subversives and it operated until 1971. The program infiltrated domestic political organizations to undercut the challenge posed by, initially, the Communist Party, but then by those opposed to the Vietnam War, civil rights activists and journalists. COINTELPRO helped forge the intelligence-security state.

Under COINTLPRO, FBI agents and paid operatives fermented tension between the Nation of Islam and Malcolm X; rumors circulate that the FBI collaborated with the NYPD in Malcolm’s assassination. The FBI also is rumored to have played a key role with Chicago police and the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office in the 1969 raid on the Black Panther Party and the killings of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. John Whitehead details other FBI questionable practices in “The FBI: The Silent Terror of the Fourth Reich.”

The Trump administration’s leadership is now dominated by two powerful factions -- military bureaucrats (i.e., failed officers) and representatives of the 1 percent (e.g., corporate executives, financiers, philanthropists). Embracing Trump’s ideology, they are attempting to turn the historic clock back to the days when America was “great,” during the post-WW-II days of suburbanization, Joe McCarthy and global hegemony.

Those days are over but, sadly, Trump and his team fail to recognize the U.S. within a new world order. They fear globalization as much as the nation’s changing demographics; their days are numbered and they know it! Plunder is their operational game.

Trump repeatedly insists that his actions are motivated, first and foremost, to protect the U.S. from jihadist terrorist threats. In the face of a terrorist attack attributed to a Muslim(s), people should expect the Trump team to unleash a massive counter-offensive, with the nation’s integrated military and state/local police apparatus – together with the vast intelligence network – called out to defend the country in the face of a national-security threat.

Politicians and media pundits can be expected to rise-up with one voice and echo Trump’s alarm like they did following the Syrian bombing. Not unlike what followed 9/11, mass round-ups and political repression could grip the nation.

What if a “terrorist” attack was executed by white nationalist? Trump’s military-police apparatus could play a “soft” or a “hard” hand depending upon orders from the top. A “soft” attack would be classified a police action and the perpetrator’s background and ideology played down. A “hard” attack, like the bombing of a federal building or para-military confrontations when people are killed, would be prosecuted but, likely, still not considered a national security threat.

Trump seems to embody a deeply flawed notion of selfhood, of a masculinity driven by misogynist’s false sense of power. He has yet to face a real crisis and one can only wonder how he would deal with a genuine national or global crisis. His need for male reassurance could well lead to a catastrophe.

Provocatively, one must ask: Would Trump, including his most trusted associates, execute a false terrorist attack to forestall loss of political power? The sad truth is that one really doesn’t know whether he would do so; no one can say definitively that Trump and his team would not cross the line and commit an illegal – let alone immoral – political action. And this, sadly, is the real problem.

If previous examples are any guide, presidents are not models of moral rectitude and Trump is among the worst. Can one think the unthinkable?

1329,"A “feeling as though the world is going to end.” That could describe what millions of people could have experienced in the last 100 years. World War I, World War II, the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Sept. 11, the ISIS rampage throughout the world, all not only understandably evoked fear of the world ending, but all revolved around madness, war and genocide.

But today that feeling is brought to liberals simply because their favorite lost an election. And strangely enough, it seems compounded with every good piece of news about the economy and the national security of the United States. Weird, no?

Today’s “feeling as though the world is going to end” is now a hallmark of those suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, a term meant to identify and mock people back from the edge of a mass hysteria assigning everything horrible in the history of humanity to a guy who was simply better and smarter at campaigning, and liked the American people more than his opponent.

Now the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in Canada alerts us to psychologists in the United States treating patients with what some in the field are terming “Trump Anxiety Disorder.” Yes, that would be TAD for short.

Forget about facing Soviet missiles 90 miles off the coast of Florida, or al Qaeda working to get its hands on a nuclear device. No, today’s distraught don’t like the man elected president of the United States and are subjected to various Obama and Clinton henchmen (and women) constantly telling them that there’s treason, racism and Nazis, oh my!

They have been goaded by a Democratic member of Congress to confront Trump supporters; a former Obama official compared border enforcement to the Holocaust; and we hear that people are going to die because of whatever the day’s Trump Armageddon happens to be.

“‘Trump Anxiety Disorder’ may not be an official diagnosis, but therapists know the symptoms,” the CBC tells us.

” ‘Is he gonna blow us all up?’ So inquired one of [a psychologist’s] patients recently, fretting out loud about the volatility of U.S. President Donald Trump’s actions during a therapy session at her Washington practice …,” continued the CBC report. The psychologist “refers to it as a ‘collective anxiety’ among patients who feel on edge about how potentially dire the president’s decisions could be. ‘There is a fear of the world ending,’ she said. ‘It’s very disorienting and constantly unsettling.’ “

In all fairness, Mr. Trump has blown up a lot. Like unemployment, which is now at historic lows. He also blew up ISIS. A few are scrambling around, but like the cockroaches they are, we’ll get the stragglers. He’s figuratively blowing up MS-13, the transnational terrorist gang also responsible for a nationwide sex trafficking ring.

Yet, the CBC reports, “In a 2017 essay for a book co-edited by psychiatrists from Harvard Medical School and the Yale School of Medicine, clinical psychologist Jennifer Panning of Evanston, Ill., called the condition ‘Trump Anxiety Disorder,’ distinguishing it from a generalized anxiety disorder because ‘symptoms were specific to the election of Trump and the resultant unpredictable sociopolitical climate,’ reported the network. “Though not an official diagnosis, the symptoms include feeling a loss of control and helplessness, and fretting about what’s happening in the country and spending excessive time on social media, she said.”

One clinical psychologist in the report noted it was the consumption of “media coverage” of the president that was making anxiety about the president worse.

There are so-called journalists and Democratic leadership in the news every day telling people that the sky is falling; that literally Armageddon is upon us; that Mr. Trump and most working with him are committing treason; that a foreign nation is in control of the country; and that ethnic cleansing is unfolding at the border.

All of these claims are as demonstrably unhinged as the lunatic “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that insisted Hillary Clinton and John Podesta were running a sex-trafficking pedophile ring from the basement of a pizza shop in Washington, D.C.

Here are the facts of the matter: Because of Mr. Trump’s policies, liberals like everyone else, have more money in their pocketbooks, are keeping more of the money they earn, are earning higher wages, are safer from domestic and international threats and have reason to be optimistic about the future.

We had 4.1 GDP growth in the second quarter of this year and the trade deficit dropped by more than $50 billion. This week consumer confidence was near an 18-year high. We have added 3.7 million new jobs since the election. We are in the midst of the longest positive job-growth streak in history. 95 percent of American manufacturers are optimistic about their company’s outlook, the highest level in history. More than 3.5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.

Certain psychologists and academics may want to assign a “disorder” to the those responding to the hysteria coming from Democratic party leadership and media, as though their anxiety-ridden reaction is beyond their control, and perhaps even Mr. Trump’s fault. It’s not. Unsurprisingly, many Democrats are tired of being misled, manipulated and abused by people like Rep. Maxine Waters, former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper and even Mrs. Clinton herself, and have decided to walk away from the party.

Liberal and leftist politicians want their own base to be depressed, afraid and paranoid about Mr. Trump. After all, when you’re consumed with conspiracy theories about Trumphitler, you don’t have any time to ask yourself about the disastrous failures of liberal leadership, and why Mr. Trump is making things exponentially better while Democrats made things worse.

1230,"The bombshell claim that ABC News ""quashed"" a story on allegations against Jeffrey Epstein has drawn new scrutiny on the controversy's ties to its own star anchor, George Stephanopoulos.

Project Veritas, whose controversial founder, James O'Keefe, has described himself as a ""guerrilla journalist,"" published the footage that featured ABC News anchor Amy Robach claiming the Disney-owned network refused to air an interview she conducted with one of Epstein’s accusers and even suggesting she'd uncovered new information about Epstein's ties to former President Bill Clinton as his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was running for president.

""I've had the story for three years... we would not put it on the air,"" Robach said on the hot mic. ""It was unbelievable what we had, Clinton, we had everything.""

Stephanopoulos, ABC News' chief anchor on ""Good Morning America"" and the Sunday program ""This Week"" who's overseen the network's political coverage, has had deep ties to the Clintons. Before he became the face of ABC News, he made a name for himself as a senior adviser to President Clinton back in the '90s. Ahead of the 2016 election, he pulled out of moderating debates after his $75,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation drew criticism.

However, what's really raising eyebrows is a 2010 report of a party Stephanopoulos attended that Epstein had hosted.

Page Six reported that the convicted pedophile held an event in honor of Prince Andrew, who was one of the high-profile figures implicated in the scandal, in his New York City townhouse, and on the guestlist were several members of the media, including Stephanopoulos.

The party took place after Epstein's 13-month prison stint for soliciting prostitutes under 18.

Despite having made multiple trips overseas with Epstein, President Clinton denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's alleged sexual predation. Strangely, though, it was reported that Epstein had a painting of Clinton depicted in the Oval Office wearing a blue dress and red high heels.

Stephanopoulos is known to be highly influential inside ABC News, but a spokesperson told Fox News he had ""no involvement"" in Robach's interview.

In an earlier statement, ABC News denied it tried to stop Robach's story, claiming her reporting at the time did not ""meet our standards to air.""

""At the time, not all of our reporting met our standards to air, but we have never stopped investigating the story. Ever since, we’ve had a team on this investigation and substantial resources dedicated to it,"" an ABC News spokesperson told Fox News.

758,"Steve Huffman, the chief executive of Reddit, knows he has some explaining to do.

Huffman, also a Reddit co-founder, landed in hot water Wednesday after admitting that he used his administrative powers to secretly edit user comments that were critical of him on r/The_Donald - a popular, pro-Trump forum (or ""subreddit""). He swapped all mentions of his own username with the names of the pro-Trump group's leaders, meaning that expletive-laden posts aimed at him looked instead as if they were insulting the group's leaders.

It was not a good idea, he told The Post Friday by phone. ""I abused my power to give the bullies a hard time,"" he said. Huffman thought of his name-swapping as a joke: a way to poke back at the people who've been harassing him and some of the site's volunteer moderators for months.

It was not taken that way.

Huffman's admission fanned the flames of controversy that had been surrounding the subreddit - and its relationship with Reddit - for months. It also capped off what had already been a long week. Reddit was already warring with self-proclaimed Trump supporters after shutting down a subreddit devoted to ""pizzagate"" -- the claim that there is secret child sex-trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats. The New York Times and others have debunked this theory. The company deleted that group for revealing people's personal information.

The subreddit and its users are known for promoting conspiracy theories and fake news across Reddit, and gleefully invading and bombarding the rest of the platform with pro-Trump memes. In fact, it was so effective at flooding the site's front page with aggressive memes and posts that Reddit changed its algorithm over the summer to try to limit its reach. Nearly all of the abuse directed at Huffman, he said, came from avid posters to r/The_Donald. After Huffman's admission, many in the pro-Trump group demanded his resignation; he has not addressed those calls.

Huffman told The Post that he had been letting the abuse from the subreddit's users roll off him, but then wondered if turning the other cheek was setting a bad example. ""If The_Donald had done this to another Reddit employee, I would have banned them,"" he said.

He said he intended to swap the names for just a few hours - despite the fact that doing so violates Reddit employee policies - just to give the subreddit's moderators a taste of what he goes through on a daily basis. Then, he said, he intended to put everything back.

Still, the decision to step in and directly edit user comments was a surprising move from Huffman, who has often said Reddit's purpose is to provide a place for communities of all stripes to set up their own groups.

Reddit has struggled to address communities who regularly test the boundaries of its guidelines, or outright break them. In 2015, it introduced new anti-harassment rules and banned a handful of subreddits that regularly violated the site's guidelines - including two forums dedicated to "" fat-shaming,"" and one that existed to coordinate harassment of members of a progressive gaming site.

The bans sparked an all-out war between the company and the small but dedicated extreme subreddits - some of which had used Reddit to circulate stolen photos, among other things. Reddit's former interim CEO, Ellen Pao, resigned in the middle of that war last year; Huffman succeeded her. And since he took over, Huffman has maintained that Reddit will not interfere with users' posts, as long as they stayed within the basic guidelines.

To take a step across that line, especially for a joke, is a major departure from that philosophy.

""What he did completely destroys the credibility of Reddit,"" wrote UnimatrixZeroOne, a Reddit moderator who ""out of anger"" released screen shots of Slack conversations Thursday between Reddit moderators, admins and Huffman about the altered posts. Huffman confirmed on Friday that the images were authentic.

In those conversations, some of the site's other moderators expressed frustration with the pro-Trump subreddit and asked Huffman to ban it for repeatedly violating guidelines. One wrote that the group's members had released personally identifying information about others during the election season. That person also mentioned receiving specific threats: ""Car vandalism, pipe bomb threat (specific). Rallying calls to ruin my personal life,"" the moderator wrote.

Huffman's distaste for the group is clear, but the chats showed he does not agree with banning it outright. ""You make it seem like I don't care about figuring out t_d,"" Huffman wrote later in the chat, going on to say that ""banning it,"" as many of the moderators had asked, ""would create a mess."" (The moderators regularly abbreviate ""The_Donald"" to ""t_d"" or ""td."")

""You managed to pull a move that actually unified us with them against this mistake,"" one moderator replied.

Even Reddit users that don't support Trump have criticized Huffman. ""I can't stand the thought of Trump entering the White House, but I have to stand up to this,"" said one commenter on the site. ""It's wrong and totally unprofessional. It's going to zap any trust people have with the organization.""

Huffman said he knows what he did may set a bad precedent that could hurt users' trust in the site. But he also said, having seen this torrent of abuse first hand, that he will have Reddit step up its efforts to let users filter out negative content, and to take on the general problem of harassment.

He didn't offer a timeline for those steps. But, he promised, they will have more finesse than his ill-received attempt at a joke.

""I had my fun with them, they had their fun with me,"" he said. ""But we are not going to tolerate harassment for any others.""",mainstream
91,"WASHINGTON (AP) - The bizarre rumors began with a leaked email referencing Hillary Clinton and sinister interpretations of references to pizza parties. It morphed into fake online news stories about a child sex trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats operating out of a Washington, D.C., pizza joint.

On Sunday, it culminated in violence when police say a North Carolina man fired an assault rifle inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant as he attempted to ""self-investigate"" the conspiracy theory known in the Twitterverse as ""Pizzagate.""

No one was hurt and the man was arrested. But the shooting alarmed those from neighboring businesses all the way to the White House about the real life dangers of fake news on the internet. One of those people posting on the conspiracy theory is the son of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed national security adviser.

On Monday, White House Spokesman Josh Earnest, asked about the shooting, said, ""There's no denying the corrosive effect that some of these false reports have had on our political debate, and that's concerning in a political context. It's deeply troubling that some of those false reports could lead to violence.""

Edgar Maddison Welch, 28 of Salisbury, North Carolina, was arrested Sunday afternoon outside the popular eatery in an affluent neighborhood of the nation's capital, police said. At his initial appearance Monday in D.C. Superior Court, Welch was ordered held pending a hearing scheduled for Thursday. The public defender he was assigned didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Court records made public Monday state Welch fired an AR-15 assault rifle multiple times inside the restaurant but later walked out with his hands up and unarmed, leaving his weapons inside. He told police ""he had read online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there."" He said he ""was armed to help rescue them"" and ""surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.""

Welch was charged on multiple counts, including assault with a dangerous weapon. Authorities recovered the AR-15 assault rifle and a handgun from the restaurant, court paperwork said. Police said an additional weapon was recovered from his vehicle.

The precise origins of the conspiracy theory Welch said he went to investigate are murky, though it seems to have started gaining momentum in the week before the election. Some elements trace back to hacked emails from Clinton Chief of Staff John Podesta that were released by Wikileaks that refer to pizza parties, with online commentators speculating that ""pizza party"" is a code word for something more nefarious. By Nov. 3, Comet Ping Pong - so named because patrons can play ping pong on tables in the back of restaurant - had been pulled into the conspiracy.

""Let me state unequivocally: These stories are completely and entirely false, and there is no basis in fact to any of them. What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences,"" Comet's owner, James Alefantis, said in a statement Sunday night.

At least one person who isn't ready to give up on the conspiracy theory is prominently connected to Trump's transition team. Michael Flynn Jr. is an adviser to his father, Michael Flynn, whom Trump selected to serve as national security adviser. Flynn Jr. has sent numerous posts on Twitter about the Pizzagate conspiracy theories. Flynn Jr., who has accompanied his father to presidential transition meetings inside Trump Tower and lists the presidential transition website as part of his Twitter bio, tweeted Sunday night that, ""Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story.""

Trump's team had no immediate response to questions about the conspiracy theory or the younger Flynn's role in the presidential transition.

On Monday, at an address listed for Welch in Salisbury, a woman drove out as a reporter was approaching and asked him to leave. She then hammered a ""no trespassing"" sign on a stand by the private driveway.

Comet Ping Pong was closed Monday, but neighbors brought flowers and cards to the storefront saying ""We support Comet"" and ""we love you and stand by you.""

Wiktoria Skrzypinska lives a few blocks from Comet. She said she had heard the rumors about Comet but was shocked to learn that somebody had become so enmeshed in the conspiracy theory to enter the restaurant with an assault rifle.

""I guess we all knew it was fake. It was so obvious I didn't even bother with it,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the arrest of a man who police say fired shots in a pizzeria while investigating a fake news story (all times local):

A man who police say fired an assault rifle inside a pizzeria in the nation’s capital while investigating a fake news story about Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring has been ordered held until at least Thursday.

Presiding Magistrate Judge Joseph E. Beshouri ordered 28-year-old Edgar Maddison Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina, jailed until a preliminary hearing and detention hearing set for 9 a.m. Thursday in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

Welch was arrested after Sunday’s shooting at Comet Ping Pong. No one was injured.

He appeared in handcuffs in court Thursday wearing a white, disposable jumpsuit used when authorities take a suspect’s clothing as evidence. He was appointed a public defender who didn’t immediately return requests for comment.

Court records show a man charged with a firing a rifle inside a pizzeria surrendered peacefully after he told authorities he failed to find evidence after fake online news stories said the eatery was secretly harboring child sex slaves.

Twenty-eight-year-old Edgar M. Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina, was expected to make an initial court appearance Monday afternoon in the District of Columbia.

Police say he brought a rifle into the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in the nations’ capital because he wanted to investigate rumors contained in fake online news reports claiming it was connected to a child sex trafficking ring supposedly run by Hillary Clinton.

The court document states Welch “surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.”

In recent weeks, the so-called Pizzagate scandal has gained currency among some quarters in social media, fueled by the fake news stories distributed online.

The conspiracy theory involving a fake news story that links Hillary Clinton and a D.C. pizza shop to a child exploitation ring has at least one prominent adherent linked to President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team.

Michael Flynn Jr. is an adviser to his father, Michael Flynn, whom Trump selected to serve as national security adviser.

Flynn Jr. has sent numerous posts on Twitter about the conspiracy theories of Pizzagate, a fake news story that suggests a pizza shop called Comet Ping Pong plays a key role in a child sex trafficking ring run by Clinton.

Police say the conspiracy theory led to violence Sunday when a North Carolina man fired a rifle in the restaurant as he sought to investigate the accusations. No one was injured, and the man was arrested.

Flynn Jr., who has accompanied his father to presidential transition meetings inside Trump Tower and lists the presidential transition website as part of his Twitter bio, tweeted Sunday night that, “Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it’ll remain a story.”

Trump’s team had no immediate response to questions about the conspiracy theory or the younger Flynn’s role in the presidential transition.

The bizarre conspiracy theory known as Pizzagate that police say led to a nonfatal shooting at a pizza shop in the nation’s capital has affected several area businesses.

Politics and Prose is an independent bookstore a few doors down from Comet Ping Pong, where a North Carolina man was arrested Sunday after police say he fired a rifle while trying to investigate a fake news story about Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring.

Bookstore co-owners Bradley Graham and Lissa Muscatine said that while Comet Ping Pong has found itself at the center of the conspiracy theory, the bookstore and other businesses on the block also received threats and menacing phone calls in recent weeks.

Graham said the store has taken the threats seriously, reporting them to police. He expressed frustration that police seemed uninterested before Sunday’s shooting in investigating more thoroughly.

Politics and Prose was open for business Monday; Comet Ping Pong was closed through Monday afternoon, as it normally is. Neighbors brought flowers and cards to the restaurant storefront saying “We support Comet” and “we love you and stand by you.”

Authorities say a man who fired a rifle inside a pizzeria in the nation’s capital while investigating a fake news story about Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring is expected to appear in court Monday afternoon.

Police say 28-year-old Edgar Maddison Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina, was arrested after Sunday’s incident at Comet Ping Pong. No one was injured and he was arrested afterward.

Bill Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, says Welch is expected to make his first appearance in court sometime after 1 p.m. Monday.

It was unclear how long it might take before Welch’s case is heard.

An incident report lists a Colt AR-15 rifle, a Colt .38 handgun, a shotgun and a folding knife among the items seized in the case. Welch is charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, other weapons offenses and destruction of property.

672,"SINCE announcing the end of his Arsenal reign ten days ago, Arsene Wenger has been reeling off one-liners like a touchline Oscar Wilde.

And after being handed a warm ovation from an Old Trafford crowd which once loathed him, the outgoing Arsenal boss was at it again.

Wag Wenger said: “Once you’re not a danger any more, everyone loves you.”

The Frenchman is perfecting his wry smile and self-deprecating humour — but there is no doubt he wants to carry on as a top-level manager.

For now, though, his farewell tour is settling into a familiar routine — kind words, good grace and smiles aplenty, then Arsenal throw away a decent result in the dying minutes.

There is a reason why he’s leaving, after all.

Wenger hasn’t been a serious threat to his rivals for over a decade now.

That’s part of the reason why he was handed such a classy reception here — with widespread applause from punters in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand at the start of either half.

Sir Alex Ferguson says Manchester United’s bitter rivalry with Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger ‘made the Premier League’

Before kick-off, Sir Alex Ferguson was lurking by the dugouts like the Ghost of Christmas Past.

It would have surprised no one had the great man presented Wenger with a dry-cleaning bill for the blazer Cesc Fabregas had splattered with tomato sauce during the Pizzagate rumpus of 2004.

Instead it was a silver vase, ‘The first time I’ve been given a trophy before kick-off’, joked Wenger.

Before the second half, United’s mascot, a cartoon Lucifer known as Fred the Red, shook Wenger’s hand.

Not all of the mascot fraternity have been so supportive.

Some are suspicious that, during the Wenger In-Wenger Out civil war, the bloke inside the Gunnersaurus costume remained conspicuously silent.

When Wenger handed in his team-sheet, weakened by eight changes in preparation for Thursday’s Europa League semi-final second leg, many feared another of the fearful shellackings he’s suffered on this patch in recent years.

As it happened, thanks to an equaliser from former United misfit Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Arsenal’s side — the youngest fielded by Wenger in the league since the 8-2 humiliation here in 2011 — almost earned a deserved point.

Most would have wanted Wenger to get a result against his bitter rival Jose Mourinho.

Few doubt that he’s the good guy in this long-running spat.

Mourinho has hurled the worst of the insults, even though Wenger got pushy at Stamford Bridge a couple of years ago.

And while Wenger’s teams have been responsible for some of the most attractive football ever seen in the Premier League, Mourinho is the sort of bloke you would fancy to park the bus when playing air hockey with his kids at the seaside.

He will never be regarded with the same affection as Wenger — but he already boasts more trophies.

Mourinho’s teams tend to find a way to win and Wenger has only ever overcome the Portuguese once in a league match.

This time, United prevailed by lumping it into the box to Belgian battering ram Marouane Fellaini.

The approach almost worked when he hit the post in the 89th minute and Marcus Rashford bundled in, only to be denied by an offside flag.

And it did succeed a minute later when the big man applied his magnificent barnet to Ashley Young’s cross. So Wenger was left with only three league wins here in 22 years.

When asked for a favourite Old Trafford memory, he mentioned the 2002 title win.

But Wenger added: “In this job, you remember defeats much better than victories, so I also have some painful memories here.”

Ferguson had praised Wenger in a heartfelt interview for the matchday programme.

He talked of an ‘edge’, a ‘feistiness’ and of simply ‘having to win’ those classic meetings during the great United-Arsenal duopoly between 1998 and 2004.

It was all a reminder that while Mourinho was Wenger’s nastiest rival, his duels with Ferguson defined him.

Ferguson was hardly exaggerating when he said their rivalry had “made the Premier League”.

Since retiring in 2013, Ferguson has successfully reinvented himself as an amiable uncle, turning up at weddings, Bar Mitzvahs and even the leaving dos of journalists.

Mourinho said it was his idea that Ferguson should present Wenger with his memento — and the three men who between them have won 19 of 27 Premier League titles — briefly posed together.

During the match, Arsenal’s fans sang of “Forty-nine undefeated” and “Winning the league in Manchester” — but Wenger’s greatest hits are all in the past.

When his team threw away a decent result, just as they had in the 1-1 home draw with Atletico Madrid three days

 earlier, Old Trafford launched into a cheeky chorus of ‘Arsene Wenger, we want you to stay!’

Then Mourinho insisted he hoped to face the Frenchman again one day.

MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Thank you very much, John, good to see you tonight. Breaking tonight on THE STORY. So, President Trump tonight wants to know what was going on in the Obama administration when Russia supposedly began to meddle way back in 2014. Tweeting, 'Obama was president up to and beyond the 2016 election, so why didn't he do something about Russian meddling?' And what about those in charge who are now sure that the Russian plot worked? But they sounded very different back then.

James Clapper was the Director of National Intelligence from 2010-2017, charged with bringing together all of the input from all of the intel agencies that are under his watch. He was the guy was supposed to bring it all together and assess what's going on. Remember, his post was created after 9/11 because of a tragic lack of dots connecting in the run up to the attack. So, how did he do connecting the dots, which was his job? Compare what Clapper said the summer before the 2016 election when Clinton and Trump were still out there campaigning and the outcome was still months away with what he's saying now.

JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: It was just a screw up of trouble or was it ultimately to try and influence the election? We don't know enough to say the motivations. I don't think there's any question about -- clearly, the Russians were trying to affect the election.

MACCALLUM: Clapper's latest comments were in reaction to a series of very interesting tweets over the weekend from Facebook's Robert Goldman, who says this. And you know, Facebook was used for a lot of the input here from the Russians according to what we learned. He said, 'I've seen all the Russian ads, and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was not the main goal. The majority the Russian ad spend happened after the election.' Trace Gallagher following this story live for us from our Los Angeles bureau tonight has more. Good evening, Trace.

TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening, Martha. President Trump's rapid-fire burst of more than a dozen tweets this holiday weekend mostly went after the usual targets -- those he believes are carrying out a witch hunt against him like CNN, the Democratic Party, and former President Obama. But the president also offered a few surprises by applauding an adversary and admonishing an ally. For example, when the ranking Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, was pressed on something that President Trump has been saying for more than a year, the fact that Russian meddling began midway through President Obama's second term. 

 Schiff, said this on CNN. Watch.

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D—CALIF.: I said all along that I thought the Obama administration should have done more. And indeed, when we discovered and we could attribute the conduct to Russia, Senator Feinstein and I took the first step to make public attribution, because at that time, we couldn't get the Obama administration to acknowledge the Russian interference.

GALLAGHER: Schiff went on to say Trump is making the same mistake that Obama made in not countering Russian disinformation. But in response to Schiff going after the previous administration, Mr. Trump tweeted quoting, 'Finally, little Adam Schiff, the leaking monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He is finally right about something. Obama was president, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you, Adam.'

But when National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, said that Robert Mueller's indictment of more than a dozen Russians accused of meddling means that Russian interference is now 'beyond dispute.' President Trump fired up this tweet, 'General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians, and that the only collusion was between Russia and crooked Hillary, the Democratic National Committee, and the Dems.'

Conservatives are now counseling President Trump not to claim that Mueller's Russian indictments vindicate his campaign because it's unclear if Mueller will issue more indictments down the road. Though, conservatives also want to know why when President Obama was warned about Russian interference in 2014, his administration apparently disregarded the warning. Martha.

MACCALLUM: Trace, thank you very much. So, joining me now, Tammy Bruce, Columnist at the Washington Times and a Fox News Contributor; and Philippe Reines, a Former Advisor to Hillary Clinton. Philippe, let me start with you. You know, you hear the argument laid out that under President Obama's watch, all of this was going on at the time. The comments that we got from the top brass in intel were that it really wasn't that big a deal. In fact, even when President Trump, Candidate Trump at the time, suggested that, you know, there might be some sort of fraud, there might be, you know, question, reason to doubt the election. President Obama came out full force and said absolutely not, nobody can mess with the American election. But the tune changed dramatically after the outcome of the election.

PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER ADVISOR TO HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I mean, on the theme of the NBA All-Star game, I think what Donald Trump did very good, very well in 2016 and 2015 is work the refs. I don't think was what the Obama administration did about the intelligence, it's about what they said about it. In May 2016, Clapper -- knowing what he knew at that time, said they were targeting the campaign. In July, is when the DNC was hacked. And if you remember, Donald Trump's first instinct was to say the DNC hacked itself. It wasn't until September that the entire intelligence community came together and said that they unanimously believe it was Russia and that they had intelligence that Putin himself did it.

The next time that Obama saw Putin, he told him to drop it, stop. Now, playing politics was not saying anything because they were so worried about what Donald Trump would say about the legitimacy of the election, because if you remember, he was questioning a great deal that they, the White House, only wanted to speak publicly if they had Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell with them. Paul Ryan agreed and Mitch McConnell refused. He said, if you do this, I'm going to say you're doing it just to hurt Donald Trump.

MACCALLUM: Yes, but you know what they said in my public and what they should've been going behind the scenes are two very different things, Tammy. I mean, they clearly did not have their hair on fire as expression goes in terms of what we would like to see from an intelligence agency, if indeed all of this is going on. They said it wasn't a big deal. Now, they say it really is.

TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND COLUMNIST AT THE WASHINGTON TIMES: 

 Yes, I think that if that's what the case when it comes to President Obama, and McConnell and Ryan. It's the only time where President Obama didn't just need his phone and his pen, but he did more than just stay silent. In October, he was at a press conference, and he was asked about this, he actually told Donald Trump to stop whining, said that no serious person would consider this an even remote possibility that this could -- that anyone could affect the American election because they're so dispersed. 

 So, he wasn't just quiet, he didn't just not say something, he mocked and chastise people who were warning about it.

And it started, actually, back in 2012 when he mocked Mitt Romney for saying exactly the same thing. So, these are interesting questions I think that, politically, of course, when it comes to the arguments that are now being made against the president. These are important and valid thing to point out when it comes to what President Obama, up until the election when they thought Hillary was going to be winning, they didn't want to cloud over the election at that point. Only until late December when it was done, did President Obama get a fire under his chair and in order to do something, and that was as we now know to set all of this dynamic forward.

REINES: Well, Martha, if I could add two things. Actually, one, in October 2016, what President Obama said out loud was that he did not fear the voting system being hacked because our voting system, which we learn from 2000, are terrible. And for someone to hack all of them would be near impossible. He was not talking about their attempt to deal -- to undermine our election.

MACCALLUM: But why wouldn't he have said at that point, Philippe? You know, but we are concerned about Russian meddling, because we saw what happened this summer with the DNC, and we're very worried about it. There was like a hush-hush feeling because, you know, everybody thought that Hillary was going to win, who obviously was the candidate he wanted to win. 

 And everyone was just like, let's just sit on this whole thing and wait until it goes away.

REINES: I think that they were -- they had Donald Trump in their head. Honestly, they didn't want him to say when -- you're right, they thought she would win. They didn't want him to say that the Obama administration tip the scale by saying don't vote for him. Because if you remember, if they'd said something, people would have thought the Russians are making you vote, and he would've said that that's not fair. But, Martha, to be honest with you --

MACCALLUM: But isn't that interesting in and of itself though, Philippe?

REINES: -- I wish President Obama had said more. I wish he had done more.

BRUCE: I think that's part of the problem, is that you're saying that Barack Obama was controlled by the fear of what either of the Russians would have made possible or the Russians have said or Donald Trump, maybe, would've said and not willing to deal with the serious mess of it.

MACCALLUM: And as Philippe just said, just one second, because I want to get one more thought in here. Let's put up the money, it's minuscule, the money that the Russians spent on this whole thing. You know, one of the other takeaways, I think, is all that sunk in over the weekend was that it doesn't look like a terribly big deal. I mean, a million dollars compared to a $2 billion election. How much influence, when you look at all the other influences that were out there on this election, Philippe, doesn't it seem like a bit of a stretch to say that this was the factor that made Hillary lose?

REINES: No, I don't think so. First of all, it's one of the factors -- I would go back to Jim Comey, but without going down that rabbit hole. I would say that what it did was, you know, spending over a million a month on a campaign, that's more than probably Rick Perry did. I mean, they were more effective than most of the Republican field -- which I think should be very unnerving. And we should also ask whether they had western help. But you know, your audience is aware of certain things, whether it's so-called 'Pizza-gate' or Seth Rich. Those things came from the Podesta email. The hack of the Podesta e-mail was a basically free advertising for all of these negative things. And by the way, if the Russians spend even a dollar on screwing around with us, it's a dollar we should not --

MACCALLUM: Well, the president said they're laughing their asses off because the money that they put into this whole thing, they got it back a million times over in terms of sowing discord.

BRUCE: If I could, if I could add that what really made that million dollars, not a month, $1.2 million the entire campaign overall is the fact that the Democrats, the media, and liberals rode on those coat tails, move this notion that the election was not valid, the divisions between Americans, Michael Moore, the march on Washington, this is not my president, this is a fraud, the attempts to nullify done by actors here -- legitimate American actors here. Using that kind of rhetoric is what the president was alluding to in his tweet about if they wanted chaos, they succeeded based on what Americans were doing in the midst of this as well.

REINES: What Mueller said on Friday was that the Russians paid for a pro- Trump protest or pro-Trump rally the same day that they paid for a pro -- an anti-Trump rally in the same city.

MACCALLUM: That's right. The things -- it's the chaos. They wanted to sow chaos, which they certainly got. And we're still in it. Thanks, you guys. I'm sorry, I got to leave it there, but it was great. And we'll have you back soon. Thank you very much.



 So, coming up tonight, the future of the FBI and its Director Christopher Wray is a very big question tonight. Are politics trumping what the president calls the basics at the bureau? Former FBI Assistant Director Ron Hosko joins me next.

RUSH LIMBAUGH, TALK SHOW HOST AND CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: The FBI is engaged in a bunch of stuff that's time-wasting and isn't going to take us anywhere.

LIMBAUGH: Maybe the FBI should stop trying to find every case a sexual harassment in the White House, and maybe they ought to give up on this ridiculous pursuit -- the Russians colluded with Trump on the election. But clearly, this is my point: a lot of people knew, a lot of people had every bit of knowledge they knew to act on this guy, to surveil this guy. You know, we're told, well, we can't do anything until the crime has been committed. That's what has to change.

MACCALLUM: The accused Florida school shooter with his head down and his eyes on the floor in court for his status hearing just a few short hours ago. He joins a shocking club, whose members include the Boston bombers and the Chelsea bomber, each one had brushes and interactions with the FBI, and a citizen who did what they were supposed to do and blew the whistle. 

 But they got away, and they killed and injured innocent people. The Ron Hosko joins me now, Former Assistant Director of Criminal Division of the FBI. He has three decades of experience working for the agency that he dedicated so much of his life too. Ron, it's good to have you here tonight. Thank you very much for being with us.

RON HOSKO, FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE CRIMINAL DIVISION OF THE FBI: Good to be with you.

MACCALLUM: To that charge, and the president made a similar claim, that there's too much focus on Russia and some of these other things and not enough on the basics at the FBI, and that the agency has become politicized. What do you say?

HOSKO: You know, Martha, the FBI, agent workforces somewhere between, I think, and 12 and 13,000 people. That's roughly a third the size of the New York Police Department. Was the FBI had to cover with those numbers of agents? International investigations that include counterterrorism, counterespionage, thousands right there, cyber, and criminal cases ranging from public corruption to gangs, to violent crime to white-collar crime and fraud. And they have to do that on a global scale. So, that's a lot to do. And I understand the political rhetoric that's going on and a lot of it directed at the FBI right now, but we're talking about very few resources compared to the size of the range of workforce that are devoted to support Bob Mueller right now, that we're devoted to support the Hillary Clinton investigation. I don't think that politics is dominating what the FBI does. I think it's a very, very small part of what they have to do.

MACCALLUM: Understood and well-taken your points. But when people listen to what happened here, they say, how can a school expel someone, right? His name is in a public, some sort of public database for the school system, I'm sure. This kid has been expelled. Then, you've the FBI, you've got someone who clearly reaches out, says he has a gun, he has a motive, and we know from the previous time that the FBI was contacted, said he wanted to be a school shooter. Why is there not an alarm bell that goes off, that those databases talk to each other, and they say, wow, you know what, we need to go check this out. Or if the FBI has too much on their plate, call the local law enforcement and say we put all this together, you guys need to do this, because this can't happen, obviously. And I'm sure it kills you that this happen.

HOSKO: Yes. Well, it does. I mean, this hurts all of us, current people working for the FBI, and those of us who have spent our careers there. It is a catastrophic tragedy. Period. It may be a people failure, it may be a technology failure, and it may be both. But to your second point, I think that would be the path. First, the FBI has no jurisdiction in investigating, you know, proposed or would be school shooters. They do have some narrow jurisdiction to support the local law enforcement response in an active shooter situation. So, the option in my mind would be having this clear, convincing evidence from somebody close to Cruz. They should package that up. It should have gone to the Miami, the Miami office, and it should've been delivered to state and local law enforcement having jurisdiction over that school. The systems failed that community, failed their school, and in ways failed this child, Cruz -- he's an adult now -- probably failed him all along. We've heard reports of these -- that's having multiple visits and having the wrong assessments. Police being out there a dozen times, perhaps, having the wrong assessments.

MACCALLUM: But let me ask you something, before I let you go. How often does this happen that these many wires are tripped? So, is this the sort of thing that, you know, as an FBI person you say, oh, we get those kinds of messages every day? Or is a message like this that is, you know, a credible assessment of somebody who they know well? Does that happen a lot what we saw here? You know, tips from the community do trigger new investigations, whether it's criminal, particularly terror, cyber investigations, that happens all the time. Here -- this was an FBI failure, and the director is going to have to account for it.

MACCALLUM: Do you think the director should go?

HOSKO: No, I don't. No, I don't. If this was a request of his leadership --

MACCALLUM: Should the person who was supposed to passed this along to local law enforcement go?

HOSKO: I think the failure was in West Virginia at the tip line. We don't know what the details are yet, and I think if it's a people failure, then Christopher Wray need to take the right personnel action. That may be one person fired or maybe multiple people fired. Got to find facts first.

MACCALLUM: Ron Hosko, always good to have you, sir. Thank you very much.

So, shortcomings at the FBI that we just discussed begs the question, does the change that we need to see begin at home? Does it begin in church? The NFL's Benjamin Watson with a very powerful message for all of us. Plus, Steve Hilton and Dr. Carol Swain on how to change our troubled culture from the bottom up.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I had met him a couple times before. He had spent the night at the house, and that he was very polite. He seemed normal.

MACCALLUM: On this Presidents' Day, when the teenagers of Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, should've been home enjoying a day off, they were attending funerals for their classmates. These images are heart wrenching and they have ignited a fierce debate in this country, as politicians, the media, and beyond all try to pin the blame on gun-control or mental illness. But outspoken NFL player Benjamin Watson has this message for everyone. In a passionate Facebook post, he writes, 'While justice demands this young man in Parkland, Florida be held accountable for the heinous plan he carried out by his own volition, we must have the courage to take an honest assessment of our culture in its totality and how it relates to this tragedy and others like it.' Baltimore Ravens Tight End, Benjamin Watson, joins me now. Ben, good to see you tonight. Thank you for being here. What did you mean by that?

BEJAMIN WATSON, TIGHT END, BALTIMORE RAVENS: Well, what I meant by that is that every time there's an incident like this, something really horrific, we talk about respecting life. And while that's very important, we have to look at our culture as a whole. We incarcerate our young men at an alarming rate, we vote for things that create the disintegration of the family, we murder 60 million of our unborn. We're a culture that really gravitates towards violence. So, while we must hold this young man accountable, we need to step back and say, hold on, what are we as parents teaching our children? How are we as teachers dealing with kids when they have certain conflict in the classroom? All these things are very important. So, it's easy to say that is one thing or another, that its guns or law that needs to be changed. While that might be the case, on a larger aspect, we need to as individuals, as parents, as a community, as a culture, identify where we've gone wrong and be willing to have the courage to fix it.

MACCALLUM: You know, I hear you. You know, one of the things that's so hard to fathom in this whole situation, he was orphaned, then he was adopted, and then he lost both of his parents, I should say, they both died due to illness. And then, he was with one family and then he went to another family. I mean, you know, clearly, he had a tremendous amount of tragedy over the course of his life. And these people were very kind; they took him into their home and they spoke out this morning about how they feel about all this. Let's watch that.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everything everybody seems to know, we didn't know. We had rules, and he followed every rule to a tee. We knew he had one Instagram account that my son had, and I guess that would be the normal one. These other Instagram accounts that he had, we had no idea about. My son had no idea about. As far as the animal killings, he never did anything like that are our house. We have animals and he loved our animals and our animals loved him.

MACCALLUM: So, given the change that you think we need to see, Ben, you know, when you look at this case, this situation, what cries out to you?

WATSON: What cries out to me the most is that people are hurting. This young man went through so much in his life, so much tragedies, and people are really hurting. And when you take faith out of the public arena, when you take God out of there, people suffer. And whether you are Christian or not, those principles really carry us through. I mean, I talked to my father who has seen how things have changed over the course of his lifetime. A lot of people of his generation point to the fact that when we start to remove God from the public sphere, we start to suffer the consequences. And for me, I look at this young man, I see, you know, there are a lot of people like him that are suffering. How can I reach out to him? How can I share the love? How can I listen to him? A lot of times, because of the culture we're in, we're on our cellphones, we're not paying attention to who's around us. I'm willing to communicate with others and so they feel like they're isolated in these silos.

MACCALLUM: You know, let's put up these numbers, because few research says that seven out of 10 Americans consider themselves Christian. However, the number has slipped by more than eight percent over the course of the last seven years. So, what do -- and you talk about your dad -- and, you know, you speak with him about this, what do you -- what does he attribute that to?

WATSON: Well, you know, it's one thing to poll and say these people are Christian. What I'm talking about is understanding that because of guided, and because of his love for us, we respect all life. And that there's a broad spectrum there. The way you treat people is very important. And even if you look at it now, and you at how we go back and forth, we give them our different (INAUDIBLE), and we call them names, and shout and scream, we curse at each other over social media. There seems to be such a great divide when it comes to how we communicate with each other. I believe that all that really is the underlying foundation where we start to see more things like this starting to happen because people are really, really frustrated. They don't quite know how to lash out because they're not really looking at each other the way God would see us.

MARTHA MACCALLUM, THE STORY HOST: You said, Ben, in your Facebook post over this week, while we have been driven to our knees as countless voices invoke prayer, I'm haunted by the fact that this very exercise is forbidden in this school and thousands of other schools across the nation. And I asked myself, if he is God in crisis, is he also not God in peace?

WATSON: Yeah. One thing I've always said, whenever we have a natural disaster, or a hurricane, or earthquake, something like that, or a school shooting of which we've had many over the last few months, we've always invoke prayer. We say we want to send our thoughts and prayers. We want to pray for these people. And that's very, very, very important, don't get me wrong. We also need action when it comes to certain laws, whatever that maybe. But what I'm saying is that we can't come to God as if he some sort of cosmic vending machine, whenever we have a problem we just reach out to him. No, we need to be submitting to him daily in our lives. We need to be coming to him every day and saying, Lord, how can I help people? How can I reach out to people? What are the things I can do for the person that is being maligned? What can I do for the vulnerable so that they don't feel like they have to lash out and do things like this? Lord, give me wisdom when it comes to that. And that comes from a daily walk with him. It's not something we just turn to when we have a crisis. Now, he will answer us in crisis and he will come to us and save us and help us in our time of need. But more importantly, when we look at what's happening in our schools by taking prayer out of schools, by taking the Ten Commandments, God out of schools, by taking him out of the public sphere, by saying, you know, we're not going to listen to God, we're going to talk about him, we're simply going to do what we think is best, and then we turn to him in these times, it rings hollow. And so, if we can trust God during these times when we are horrified by what happened, when we have nowhere else to turn, why can't we trust him in those times of peace?

MACCALLUM: Benjamin Watson, wise man. Thank you, sir. Good to see you tonight.

MACCALLUM: Here now, Steve Hilton, host of the Next Revolution here on Fox News, and Dr. Carol Swain, former professor of political science and law at Vanderbilt University. Carol, let me start with you, you say that, you know, that the conversation always goes immediately to gun-control and mental health. What do you think about what Ben just had to say in the framework of your thinking on this?

CAROL SWAIN, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: I agree with him a 100 percent. I believe that we need to focus on character building of young people. Young people need to know the golden rule, do unto others that you would have them do unto you. And I think too much of what they're learning today in schools is about how to be offended. Too much political correctness. Young people not being taught how to think critically. And they're so easily offended and all of the stuff about bullying. Most of us who have gone to school were teased at some point. We learn to get by. 

 And I think that today, we teach our children to look for ways to be offended, and the adults are not providing the moral guidance that they need.

MACCALLUM: I hear you. I do. You know, I just think of the kids who voices were very clear and the concern they had about this young man. And I just can imagine the frustration that they have. We also have to listen to children when they come to us with these kinds of concerns because they did know some of them and they carry that burden with them now. Steve Hilton, you have said that, you know, growing up in England, you looked at what this problem was in the United States because it is unique, unfortunately, to the U.S., and you see it differently now that you're here.

STEVE HILTON, NEXT REVOLUTION HOST: Yeah, Martha, I think that actually this is the biggest issue that we have to confront in America. Tonight, we're talking about it in a terrible circumstances of department shooting, but on another night we could be talking about it in relation to gang violence, and other night it could be domestic violence, and another night it could be drug addiction or welfare dependency. It all goes back to the same thing, which is a social breakdown that's been going on in America, I think, for at least four or maybe five decades now. And at the heart of it is family breakdown. The real trend-away from children growing up in stable loving homes and the fact that more, more children are growing up in broken homes and in a culture of toxic stress and violence. And that is affecting our society in deeply troubling ways. It really is something that we can confront. But we got to really prioritize it as an issue.

MACCALLUM: Yeah, it is so important. You know, you look at Chicago, Dr. Carol Swain, you know, and the numbers of children who are killed all of the time there. And in other places where these kinds of violent outbreaks happen little bits at a time, but the numbers add up to an extraordinary number. And family breakdown is a big part of that environment, is it not?

SWAIN: It is. And you can trace the dysfunction back to the 1960's. In 1962, the Supreme Court removed prayer from school, 1963, bible reading, and if you look at the indicators of dysfunction, I mean, everything changed dramatically in the 1960's. And I think it can be traced back to those decisions that we made. And I believe that the way we correct things is to start encouraging young people to value life. In the black community, there's a devaluing of life at every stage. You see it on the abortion rate. You see it on the black on black violent crime rate. And that's something we need to turn around. But an entire society devalues life, they're afraid of God, and those who profess to be Christians, there's nothing about their behavior of this society that will suggest that they're truly Christians in the biblical sense.

HILTON: So there's something practical I think we need to focus on, which is so much of this comes back to the way kids are raised and the way that they are raised by their parents. We can actually help parents to do a better job. You've got generation after generation now who are growing up having experienced really bad parenting, so they don't know how to do it themselves. And we can actually give them practical help to do that, and that is one simple thing that we can do that would make a difference.

MACCALLUM: Thank you both. Very good to have both of you weigh in on all these really important topic tonight. We hope that the conversation continues from here. Steve and Dr. Carol Swain, many thanks. So coming up, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's rare interview shaking up what we have heard about North Korea. Plus, Oprah versus Trump in 2020 in private, apparently, she has reportedly not ruled out running. Now President Trump is daring her to do just that. Karl Rove weighs in next.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



 OPRAH WINFREY: There's been some members of Congress, including Republicans, questioning his stability and fitness for office.

MACCALLUM: President Trump practically daring Oprah Winfrey to run against him in 2020, after he caught this exchange on 60 Minutes last night. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



 WINFREY: So polls are showing that respect for the United States is eroding around the world. There've been some members of Congress, including Republicans questioning his stability and fitness for office. During the campaign, we are all aware that some 20 women accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior. Do you think the president is held to a different standard when it comes to this issue of sexual harassment?

MACCALLUM: So in response to the question, primarily in the way they were phrased, President Trump tweeted, just watch a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point, I knew very well. She's interviewing a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted the facts and correct. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated like all the others. Joining me now, Karl Rove, Fox News contributor and former senior advisor to President George W. Bush, and our resident Oprah expert joining me tonight. Hi Karl, good to see you.

KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you.

MACCALLUM: So the president tweeted a lot over the course of the last couple of days, the last 48 hours or so, but this got him fired up when he watch it. He thought it was unfair, what do you think?

ROVE: Well, first of all, the presidential election is three years off, she has said that she may run, she might not run. She said God hadn't talked to her. She thought that if God wanted her to run, he talk to her about it. And I would remind you, that even while she's overwhelmingly draw favorable reviews, in the NPR polls 35 percent said she should run for president, and 54 percent said she should not. My point is the president ought to be focused on being president. My opinion is, Oprah Winfrey is unlikely to run, and there's plenty of time before the next election if she does run for him to voice his opinions. I think the American people want him to focus on being president. I don't think it helps his cause or the cause of his agenda for him to be spending his time punching down to somebody who may or may not run and is unlikely to run in my opinion.

MACCALLUM: Yeah. You know, I'm curious what you thought about the panel itself and the questions and, you know, the time that 60 Minutes devoted to giving her that platform to do that.

ROVE: Well, look, the panel -- they started this a year ago. The panel is consists of a small number of people, half of them pro-Trump, half of them not Trump, and they did it a year ago. I really have a concern about doing these focus groups. I know we at Fox do them sometimes, but I think there's all kind of potential problems in having a small group like that and trying to make big judgments. Particularly a group that you've already exposed to television coverage and then brought them back. Those people are going to be inclined less to give their opinion than to do what they did before only times ten and that is performed for the camera. So it makes for interesting television. I'm not certain it's particularly good journalism.

MACCALLUM: It does make interesting television sometimes. And here's another one we pulled up from CNN that we thought was pretty interesting. Watch this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



 UNINDENTIFIED MALE: We're one year. One year in. How's he doing?

UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: Great. Better than I would have ever dreamt. I mean that sincerely.

(END VIDEO CLIP)



 MACCALLUM: Those are Trump supporters, obviously, and they check in with them from time to time. I think in that instance, they were thinking that they probably had changed their minds by now, but they surprisingly say that they didn't. I mean, I understand you're saying from a polling perspective this kind of thing is meaningless, right?

ROVE: Yeah. It was a Westinghouse effect. In the 1920's, they did some studies and said, OK, we're changing the things inside the factory here. They're going to improve things. But they really didn't change anything, and people's productivity increased. Well, same thing happens when you say we're going to put you on camera and we want to have your opinion. People sort of perform how they think that they ought to perform, not necessarily how they really feel. I'm sure all of those people were honest and authentic in their views of I think the president is doing a good job. But, look, let's not suggest that that is scientific polling or precise.

MACCALLUM: In the 30 seconds that I have left, do you believe the approval numbers that you see based on the problems that we've had with polls so far in this presidency?

ROVE: I take it with a grain of salt, but I take -- if you have an average of them, I'm interested more in, sort of, where those numbers are moving up or down. But do I believe that any particular poll has the exact right number? No. Do I think that an average of the polls tends to give us a sense of where we are roughly? Yes. Do I think it shows movement? Yeah. 

 That's the main thing that I rely upon for is to show that are things getting better or getting worse. And in candor, the president has gotten better in the last couple of months, and as has the tax reform bill, and I think the two things are tied together, along with people sentiment about the economy, which is gotten very good over the last several months in a wide variety of studies and surveys and polls. And some of those studies involve very large panels of people that have been around for a long time. 

 I have greater confidence in those than I do in a lot of these robocall.

MACCALLUM: I think the midterms are going to be fascinating. And we will be there with you, Karl. Thank you very much. Good to see you tonight.

MACCALLUM: So coming up next, a rare admission from our secretary of state. He is nervous about the nuclear threat from North Korea and he is ready to sit down and negotiate with Kim Jong-un. Is that the only option that we have at this point?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



 UNINDENTIFIED MALE: My job is to never have a reason for the first bomb to drop, and we don't know precisely how much time is left on the clock.

UNINDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to use all the time available to me. Our diplomatic efforts will continue until that first bomb drops. My job is to never ever have a reason for the first bomb to drop, and we don't know precisely how much time is left on the clock.

(END VIDEO CLIP)



 MACCALLUM: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson detailing the United States ongoing efforts to deal with the threat from North Korea. And while Tillerson expressed his desire for a diplomatic solution, he also noted that military options are still on the table, which is what we always hear here. And that the U.S. is using large sticks, not carrots, to get Kim Jong-un to the table. Tom Rogan is the Washington Examiner commentary writer and he joins me now. Tom, good to see you again. How would you assess Tillerson in this interview? Do you think he's on the right track?

TOM ROGAN, WASHINGTON EXAMINER COMMENTARY WRITER: Good to be with you, Martha. I think he is on the right track in terms of the broad theme of trying to pursue this diplomatically. But the problem is, if you look at South Korea being very much detach now from the Trump administration tougher approach to dealing with North Korea. If you look at the timeline probably less than six months now to a credible ICBM post-warhead capability on the North Korean side, and the Chinese still not giving, really, anywhere near enough. I think his notion of how successful diplomacy is at the moment is one that is not borne out by the fact.

MACCALLUM: Yeah. And as you point out, the time frame looks to be somewhere around six months. I heard as early as this summer. And the big looming issue is to have that nuclear capable warhead on an ICBM missile. 

 And the capability looks like they're heading in that direction. So it's not like we have all the time in the world here. If we need to step it up, what do you recommend?

ROGAN: Well, look, I think that's point. I think the critical element here is if you look at the history of late development of ICBM's, it's about the heat shield, it's about re-entry. It's about targeting. It's basic stuff. But what should we do? I think the first thing President Trump needs to do is to tweet at President Xi and say, listen, China, you have failed the United States here. You pledged to be a partner. You have not done that. So we're going to sell a lot more high-end equipment to Taiwan and India. We're going to push for India to enter the nuclear supplies group. We're going to change the balance of power. Also, sanctioning Chinese financial entities that act as cutouts, as clearinghouses for the North Koreans to keep them alive. And cargo vessels that are providing some limited exports and imports to the North Korean economy.

MACCALLUM: That's interesting. I mean, I can imagine the backlash if the president started tweeting foreign policy at President Xi. But you think that's exactly what he should do?

ROGAN: Well, yes, because what else are we going to do? If we're running down the clock, the only other option is the military option, which is perceptively catastrophic. All we live within North Korea that can threaten ICBM destruction of an American city. And so, I think -- the Chinese are realistic. You've got to play them at their own game.

MACCALLUM: Play hardball and mean it.

ROGAN: Play hardball. And that's the way diplomacy will work.

MACCALLUM: So the North Koreans, to the Olympics for just a moment in the

 30 seconds that I have left, the scary suggestion is that some of them because of their failure to bring home a medal could see some very serious ramifications, including ending up in a work camp. Do you think that's a realistic possibility for them?

ROGAN: Fortunately, at least for those North Korean athletes, I don't think so now because the functional issue is that North Korea has seen the diplomatic opportunity with the South Koreans, especially to say, look, we're not that bad. And that helps them buy time, again, on the slower track of diplomacy instead of tougher actions.

MACCALLUM: Tom Rogan. Thank you very much, Tom. Good to see you tonight.

MACCALLUM: So coming up next, we will honor those laid to rest today in Florida and remember the words of a man who led America through one of her darkest times when we come back.

MACCALLUM: Finally tonight, friends and family gather today to mourn two more victims from the Florida school shooting. Fifteen-year-old, Luke Hoyer, said to have always been smiling. He loved basketball and Chicken McNuggets, and he was very close to his mom. Fourteen-year-old, Alaina Petty, remembered as a vibrant and determined young woman who loved to serve and help with the cleanup efforts after Hurricane Irma. They will be missed. On this Presidents' Day, those fitting words from President Harry Truman as he spoke upon the surrender of Nazi Germany, but they are fitting tonight as well. We must seek to bind up the wounds of a suffering world, to bring an abiding peace, a peace rooted in justice and in law. That is our story for tonight. Thanks for being here everybody. Send us your thoughts at Martha MacCallum, and we will see you back here tonight at 7:00. Tucker Carlson is coming up next.

976,"The “Pizzagate” story goes beyond some of the other bogus claims made during this election. “Random D.C. pizza parlor is the home of an international pedophilia ring run by the former first lady and Democratic nominee for president” wouldn’t pass muster at The Onion, to say nothing of less reputable, less entertaining satire sites. Yet Welch is not alone. The New York Times reported in November that one other person had already shown up to investigate, presumably without a high-powered firearm. There were death threats and hundreds of social-media posts.

The gullibility involved in the case is disheartening, and the recourse to weapons is scary. But the more frightening problem is that there’s no promising solution to the causes that produced the showdown in Chevy Chase on Sunday. Most suggestions for fighting back boil down, as Shafer notes, to some form of censorship, which is an unacceptable path.

Nor is the traditional press in a position to make much difference. There’s a long list of overlapping theories, some valid and some not, for the weakened position of the traditional press, but whatever the truth, it’s not structurally prepared to fight this sort of thing. The barriers to entry for media outlets, including the bogus ones that spread the Pizzagate story, are extremely low, while traditional outlets can no longer maintain any sort of oligopoly on distributing news, so that the emergence of fake news stories is unstoppable. The press can debunk them, of course, and in fact it has done an admirable job—as Silverman’s piece and another in the Times did. But this makes little difference. The audiences that are receptive to those debunkers are the ones who would have missed the original fake story anyway, and the ones who believe the fake story are inclined to dismiss mainstream reports out of hand, so the debunkers won’t influence them either.

It would be helpful if responsible citizens would do all they could do to stifle stories like this. But that hasn’t always been the case. Retired General Michael Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency who Trump has named as his national security adviser, helped spread one of the early stories about a pedophilia ring that Silverman identified:

One major proponent of the Pizzagate story has, unsurprisingly, been InfoWars, Alex Jones’s clearinghouse for wild-eyed conspiracy theories. Trump has courted Jones, appearing on Jones’s radio show and praising him.

Meanwhile, Flynn’s son, who is a top adviser to his father, fueled the Pizzagate story Sunday night with a tweet:

The technique of raising a completely bogus idea and then demanding that its critics debunk it—by proving a negative—is a favorite technique of conspiracy theorists, and more recently it’s become a favorite technique of the Trump team.",mainstream
469,"Arsenal new boy Granit Xhaka continues to win over Gunners fans by revealing his career highlight is beating Manchester United.

The 23-year-old has already won two Swiss Super Leagues with Basel and one Swiss Cup and he collected the under-17 World Cup in 2009.

He has been compared to Andres Pirlo and Bastian Schweinsteiger and named in the 2014-15 Bundsliga team of the season.

But he reveals the pinnacle of his already excellent career was knocking Alex Ferguson’s star-studded side out of the 2011-12 Champions League with his boyhood European minnows Basel.

Xhaka said: “I think the best moment of my career was a game against Manchester United for Basel.

“We played in Manchester and drew 3-3, then we played at home and won 2-1 to knock them out and progress to the next round.

“It was big. Basel were a smaller club than Manchester United and to beat them 2-1 was a very nice moment.”

Xhaka’s combative style should revolutionise Arsene Wenger’s usually soft-centred side for next season.

The North Londonders travel to Old Trafford on November 19 and with Jose Mourinho in charge a fiery game, in the mould of the infamous Pizzagate from 2004 when the two sides went to war and clashed in the tunnel after the game, is on the cards.",mainstream
886,"A struggling model and actor has been arrested for setting fire to the pizza parlor that became infamous due to a false conspiracy theory that came to be known as Pizzagate.

Ryan Jaselskis, 22, is facing federal arson charges after being identified as the man caught on surveillance video at Comet Pizza on January 23, the same night that an individual intentionally set fire to the Virginia eatery.

He was identified by a firefighter who recognized Jaselskis' blue jacket from the surveillance video while treating him on February 4 following a bizarre incident at the Washington Monument.

On January 23, Jaselskis set fire to some curtains at the pizza parlor before fleeing, with footage showing his attempt to destroy at least one camera on his way out the door.

Jaselkis found himself in need of medical attention after he was tasered by an officer with the U.S. Park Police while attempting to break into the national landmark according to court documents.

He was charged with unlawful entry and assaulting a police officer at that time and released from jail the next day.

That incident was captured by Cam Hasbrouck, who later uploaded the video to social media.

Jaselskis then returned to the Washington Monument hours after his release and again attempted to break in, only to be thwarted once again by US Park Police.

There was no resistance from Jaselkis during his second run-in with authorities, and he was later charged with unlawful entry, destruction of public property, and contempt in Superior Court.

It was not until Tuesday though that Jaselskis was officially declared a suspect by agents with the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms agents.

He was booked after a customer who was at Pizza Comet on the night of the fire picked Jaselskis out of a line-up.

Jaselskis is now facing up to 20 years in prison on the charge of federal arson, and is being held without bond until a hearing next week.

This is not the first incident to occur at Comet Pizza in the wake of fake news reports claiming that is was a front for a child smuggling ring.

In 2016, a man invaded the pizzeria with an assault rifle.

He was later was given a four-year prison sentence.

Welch, 28, stormed into Comet Ping Pong, an upscale pizza house, with an AR-15 assault rifle after becoming outraged by right-wing talk on social media that it was central to a pedophile network with deep connections to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

No one was hurt, but police had to lock down the neighborhood before Welch surrendered.

The incident followed President Donald Trump's victory over Clinton in a heated contest that was fueled at times by fake news circulating on social media.

Welch, who drove from North Carolina to Washington to 'investigate' Comet himself, was seen by some as much a victim for having believed reports on websites such as Reddit and Infowars that the restaurant hid a politically connected pedophile ring.",mainstream
618,"Mark Dice (born Mark Shouldice;[1] December 21, 1977) is an American conspiracy theorist, activist, author, and right-wing conservative pundit, who has been active since at least 2008.

Dice was born on December 21, 1977,[2] and is a member of the Republican Party.[3] As of July 2019 , he resided in Pacific Beach, San Diego.[4]

Claiming a life-long interest in ""current events, politics and how the world works"",[5] Dice is a right-wing, conservative conspiracy theorist[6][7] who has provided the media with his input on a broad array of topics.

In June 2008, Dice launched ""Operation Inform the Soldiers"", an effort to send DVDs, letters, and declassified government documents to U.S. service members in Iraq. Dice hoped these would prove 9/11 conspiracy theories and cause the recipients to ""rethink why they’re fighting.""[8] On June 10, syndicated talk show host Michael Reagan advocated on-air that Dice should be assassinated for having done so. Six days later, Reagan hosted Dice on his show and apologized for his comments.[9]

Dice promoted the Jade Helm 15 conspiracy theories, claiming that the 2015 military exercises were preparation for a declaration of martial law in the United States.[10]

Dice is the founder of a San Diegan Christian activist group called ""The Resistance"", described as ""known for its hardline stance on morality"". In 2008, in response to Starbucks' reintroduction of its original logo (featuring a topless siren), Dice led his group and its 3,000 members in boycotting the coffee chain: ""The Starbucks logo has a naked woman on it with her legs spread like a prostitute […] It's extremely poor taste, and the company might as well call themselves Slutbucks."" Starbucks had more than 6,000 locations in 2008.[11]

As the founder of The Resistance, Dice told KFSN-TV of his group's intention to disrupt theater showings of 2009's Angels & Demons because the film ""is a fraud, aimed at covering up the existence of a secret society called the Illuminati."" Dice contended that the Illuminati were instrumental in the September 11 attacks and the financial crisis of 2007–2008.[12]

Conflating celebrities with the Illuminati and Satanism, Dice called musicians Jay-Z and Beyoncé ""Illuminati puppets. I call them Satanic skanks"". Dice described celebrities' connection to the Illuminati as the pursuit of power via message of materialism.[13]

Dice called Super Bowl halftime shows of the 2010s ""elaborate Illuminati rituals hidden in plain sight"". The Super Bowl XLVI and XLVII halftime shows allegedly featured ""secret Illuminati hand signs"", while musician Katy Perry—star of the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show—""promotes bisexuality and appears to be some kind of Satanic Witch"".[14] Dice published a YouTube video denouncing the Super Bowl 50 halftime show as ""gay Pride propaganda"". Dice noted the show featured the rainbow-colored message ""believe in love"" and a platform with four ramps which Dice described as a ""crucifix blasphemously placed in the centre.""[15]

Regarding the unrest after the 2016 shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, Dice decried the ""black thugs who are rioting over this black thug.""[16] After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018, Dice tweeted a distortion of the events: ""Someone tell Generation Z kids that in the event of a school shooting, they should call 911 instead of posting video of it on Snapchat."" Student survivors, including Sarah Chadwick, pushed back against Dice's claims; Dice deleted the post and did not respond to media inquiries thereabout.[17]

When the Podesta emails were leaked, Dice noted an email from Marina Abramović to Tony Podesta and conflated the former's spiritualism with Satanism, tweeting, ""I am now accepting apologies from everyone who said I was crazy for writing books about how the Establishment are Satanists"".[3]

In late 2016, Dice organized an unsuccessful boycott of Rogue One, a Star Wars film he called ""feminist propaganda"".[18] He followed this up with misgendering the seven-member South Korean boy band BTS after their performance at the American Music Awards of 2017; Dice called them lesbians and made derogatory comments about the quality of their music. After attracting the ire of BTS fans, Dice ""trolled"" them further, though Teen Vogue reported that the BTS fans' ""positive energy and love definitely outweighs derogatory insults and hate.""[19]

In August 2018, after controversial tweets by Sarah Jeong were published, Dice called her continued employment at The New York Times an ""example […] of liberal hypocrisy"".[20]

After having written The Resistance Manifesto in 2005,[21] in which the Illuminati played a minor role, Dice devoted his entire next book—2009's Illuminati: Facts and Fiction—to the secret society.[5] His book, The Illuminati in Hollywood, explains Dice's belief that liberalism is promoted by films and television,[22] while his 2013 self-published book Illuminati in the Music Industry alleges Rick Ross and Christina Aguilera's membership in the group.[23] In November 2019, Dice self-published The Liberal Media Industrial Complex about social media, its political influence, and the ""massive backslash from those wanting to regain the influence they once held.""[24]

In 2016, The Hollywood Reporter described Dice as ""best known for his YouTube videos"" and a ""rising online media star who considers himself mainstream conservative but is being called alt-right by his detractors.""[22] Inspired by The Tonight Show with Jay Leno sketch ""Jaywalking"",[25] Dice records videos in crowded locations where he asks passers-by to answer simple questions or to sign petitions.[22] Dice formulated one such petition in 2013 to repeal the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; by invoking the suggestion of supporting President Obama, Dice found people in Southern California willing to sign.[25] Dice's on-screen persona was described by a fan in The New York Times as a ""goon"".[10]

In November 2019, KUSI-TV averaged Dice's daily videos as having 250,000 views and enumerated his YouTube subscribers at ""more than 1.5 million"".[24]",mainstream
848,"Adult Swim has canceled Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace, a show which has been accused of promoting racism, sexism and bigotry, Splitsider reports.

The sketch show was canceled after one season, airing just six episodes over the summer. Created by Sam Hyde, Charls Carroll and Nick Rochefort, the show immediately garnered criticism for controversial sketches – including one where Hyde wore blackface – while some of its promotional material featured language that seemed to nod to the white nationalist movement known as “Alt-Right.”

Per Buzzfeed, an MDE press release stated the show would “unlock your closeted bigoted imagination, toss your inherent racism into the burning trash, and cleanse your intolerant spirit with pure unapologetic American funny_com.”

While the show rarely touched on actual politics, Hyde, MDE‘s most prominent member, has been active in Alt-Right circles online, while his Twitter account is packed with Alt-Right memes and fake news stories, including the long-debunked “pizzagate” conspiracy theory. Hyde launched his comedy career with various viral videos, including one in which he crashed a TEDx Symposium, while others boasted bits that many found explicitly racist and homophobic.

Unsurprisingly, MDE became a source of contention at Adult Swim as well. Comedian Brett Gelman cited the show as one reason he decided to sever ties with the network, while last month Buzzfeed reported that numerous executives, actors, directors, writers and producers were trying to convince Adult Swim boss, Mike Lazzo, to cancel it.

While Adult Swim has confirmed MDE‘s cancellation to various media outlets, it has not issued a full statement. Hyde and the other members of Million Dollar Extreme have yet to address the cancelation.",mainstream
614,"One of the largest child sex abuse cases in modern history uncovered by Norwegian police has been shamelessly ignored and covered up by Western media outlets.

The year-long investigation named “Operation Darkroom,” has so far resulted in the seizure of 150 terabytes of child porn involving young children and babies, with top politicians, lawyers and authorities implicated in the scandal.

Amid the rush to cover-up the Pizza scandal in the West, media outlets have conducted a co-ordinated coverup of the Norwegian case by refusing to publish any details of it in their newspapers. — YNW

Among the 51 perpetrators said to be involved, 20 have been arrested. The list of the accused includes “highly educated” individuals, including two former or current elected politicians, one teacher, a lawyer and a police officer.

Yet, English-language media both in Europe and stateside in the U.S. have ignored the story.

As Norwegian news publication Tadens Krav reports, the material shows penetration of toddlers, children being tied, children who have sex with animals and children who have sex with other children.

One of the accused men had a pregnant girlfriend and planned with another to commit offenses against the child when it was born, police said. Some of the accused performed abuses directly online, including atrocities against their own children.

Police stressed that the case involves a network. The investigation is ongoing.

So while the U.S. media busied itself with its campaign of denial, lies and cover ups involving Pizza and “fake news,” this huge child sex abuse story broke in Norway.

The story did appear on Associated Press’ wire, but did anyone run it?

The infamous crime syndicate rags The Washington Post had the story briefly on Nov. 20 but has since taken it offline, as did The New York Times. German state news group Deutsche Welle provided a brief story, and Sputnik ran a more thorough article.

It is a truly remarkable story with global implications. Take special note of the shocking file size — 150 terabytes! It’s too horrible to even contemplate. To put this into context, the Library of Congress holds about 600 terabytes of Web data.

Its online archive grows at a rate of about 5 terabytes per month. Also note the horrifically sadistic nature of the material seized.

And note that police are investigating the reach as worldwide, which means it involves a massive scale of evil filth. But nobody in the criminally compliant mainstream media thinks its newsworthy.

Adding insult to public-service journalism injury, the crime syndicate has shifted gears and rolled out entertainment media to mock you. If you can stomach it, watch Stephen Colbert (below) reading unnaturally off of a script about fake news, Pizza and Michael Flynn.

He engages in the same straw-man arguments we covered in our critique of the The New York Times’ skuldruggery.

Colbert puts forth all the usual deceptions involving Hillary Clinton, tunnels and basements before declaring Pizza was politically motivated and fake.

When you see this particular narrative, know that you are being gas-lighted and diverted.

The New Nationalist (TNN) has said from the beginning that Pizza is a poor term. This goes far beyond just one perv hangout pizzeria.

And, of course, it transcends the political spectrum, which explains why there is no investigation. The assertion that Pizza is “right-wing” inspired is a scam.

We are true humanists, who insist on protecting children from criminals.",conspiracy
1348,"In the wake of the SNC-Lavalin affair, the Liberals have taken a hit in the polls. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken a bigger one.

Multiple polls have recorded a drop in Liberal support ever since the Globe and Mail first published allegations of political interference by the Prime Minister's Office in the SNC-Lavalin affair — allegations that prompted the resignation from cabinet of former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould and the subsequent resignation of Jane Philpott as president of Treasury Board.

The CBC Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polls, has recorded a slip of over four points for the Liberals over the last month, putting the party behind the Conservatives for the first time in nearly a year.

But the losses suffered by the party are less significant than those suffered by Trudeau himself on questions relating to his own personal brand, the performance of his government and Canadians' preferences for prime minister.

Among the five pollsters who have asked the question both before and since the SNC-Lavalin affair emerged (Innovative Research Group, Ipsos, Forum Research, Nanos Research and Abacus Data), the average drop in Trudeau's polling on the question of who Canadians prefer as prime minister has been six points, compared to an average drop of just two points for these pollsters in voting intentions for the Liberals.

Since November and December, Léger, Ipsos and Abacus have recorded drops of between seven and nine points in approval or satisfaction with the performance of Trudeau's government.

Forum, which has been an outlier in showing the Liberals trailing the Conservatives by a significant margin since the beginning of 2018, found a drop of eight points in Trudeau's personal approval rating, while the party — already low in Forum's estimation — only slipped a single point.

In a survey conducted between Mar. 1-4, Innovative found that just 33 per cent of Canadians have a very or somewhat favourable impression of the prime minister, down 12 points since September.

Abacus, in a survey conducted between Mar. 5-7, found the same share of Canadians with a positive impression of Trudeau — down 11 points since December.

Both Innovative and Abacus have found only modest decreases in support for the Liberals over that time span.

That suggests either the Liberal brand retains some resilience — or voters aren't impressed enough with their options to switch their allegiance to other parties when asked to make a choice.

The numbers don't suggest that Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer or NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh have been able to take advantage of Trudeau's struggles.

While Innovative found Trudeau's favourable vs. unfavourable score dropped by a net 20 points, the polling firm also found Scheer's decreased by three points, while Singh's didn't change at all. Léger recorded Trudeau's score on preferred prime minister falling seven points, while Scheer's dropped by one and Singh's increased by just one.

Abacus has shown Scheer's numbers getting worse since a peak just after Wilson-Raybould testified before a Commons committee on Feb. 27 and Scheer demanded that the prime minister resign. In its Feb. 28 to Mar. 2 poll, 32 per cent of respondents had a positive impression of Scheer. In its Mar. 5-7 survey, that had dropped to 28 per cent.

Not even Singh's Burnaby South byelection victory on Feb. 25 — which finally gave him a seat in the House of Commons — moved the dial for the NDP leader. In Abacus's Feb. 8 to 11 survey, 20 per cent of Canadians had a positive impression of Singh. His latest numbers are virtually unchanged, at 19 per cent.

All of which suggests that the losses the Liberals suffer and the gains the Conservatives or New Democrats make in voting intentions might fade in the longer term if they're not secured by an improvement in the personal ratings of Scheer or Singh.

There are even signs now that the effects of the SNC-Lavalin affair might be starting to wear off for the Liberals, if not for the prime minister.

As of Friday afternoon, Abacus Data has been the only polling firm to release the results of surveys conducted after Philpott's resignation on Monday and the testimony of Gerald Butts, the prime minister's former principal secretary, on Wednesday.

The latest results — gathered from Tuesday to Thursday online and surveying 300 panel respondents per day for a total of 900 responses — found the Conservatives with only a one-point lead over the Liberals (34 to 33 per cent), down from the Conservatives' seven-point advantage in the days following Wilson-Raybould's explosive committee testimony (37 to 30 per cent). The shifts might not be very significant considering the sample sizes, but the trend has been consistent.

Abacus also asked respondents to choose their preferred prime minister. On that question, Trudeau's edge over Scheer has grown to five points after having fallen behind the Conservative leader by one point between Feb. 28 to Mar. 1. Of course, that's still a far smaller margin than the 16-point edge Trudeau enjoyed over Scheer in December.

But Trudeau and the Liberals have enjoyed no similar rebound in polling which doesn't feature a multiple choice option rather than a simple for-or-against question on the PM and his government. The number of Canadians with a positive impression of the prime minister has not shifted at all, according to Abacus, while approval of his government is up a mere two points.

It all suggests that Trudeau might not be the asset for the Liberal Party that he once was. At the height of his popularity after the 2015 federal election, Trudeau was significantly more popular than his party. That margin diminished after the botched diplomatic mission to India took its toll — but Trudeau still tended to poll ahead of his party.

Before the SNC-Lavalin affair, Trudeau might have been able to drag the Liberal Party along with him to another majority government in the fall. Now, the best chance for the Liberals might not be the person leading them, but the people leading their opponents.",mainstream

The only explanation I can come up with after having read this post is that you somehow managed to apply the wrong label. Clearly it was meant to be a Von Hoffman Award Nominee for being so stunningly and utterly wrong. Now I can understand the need for Mrs. Obama to pander to the ""cardboard with a dash of cheese"" crowd, and certainly forgive her for making such an odd lie in those circumstances. But you should try and be more careful when it comes to titling posts.

Speaking as a Chicagoan who is willing to passionately defend my city's many indispensable culinary traditions, I feel obligated to note that I do not in any way disagree with the First Lady's preference for New York pizza. To wit: many of us consider our reputation for deep dish pizza to be a constant source of civic embarrassment. On the other hand, our hot dogs are unmatched and only a great fool would take a cheese-steak over a Chicago-style Italian Beef sandwich.

Chicago has much more than the deep dish. But I'll take a pizza that puts fresh ingredients and a painstaking attention to sauce over foldability any day. As a Chicagoan, I now disown her.

South side Chicago girl giving it up for New York's thin, too greasy, not-saucy-enough pizza? That's a potential pandering award. Not sure if you have a category for that.

For the quote to be nominated for one of your awards, wouldn't it have to be....accurate? At least this article indicates it is not. Saying, ""It's great pizza, and I'm from Chicago"" is not the same as saying the pizza is better than Chicago's.

695,"Samuel Whitcomb Hyde (born April 16, 1985) is an American comedian, writer, performance artist and actor. He co-created the sketch comedy group Million Dollar Extreme (MDE) with Charls Carroll and Nick Rochefort.

Hyde is known for his involvement in several public pranks and internet hoaxes. His style of humor has been described as post-ironic, as he regularly blurs the distinction between himself and his characters.[1] Hyde's transgressive style has also garnered public controversy and he has been frequently associated with the alt-right. He supports white supremacist causes, including monetary donations to The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin for legal fees,[2] and jokes about conspiracy theories such as Pizzagate.[3][4][5]

After graduating from Wilton High School, Hyde enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University for one year before transferring to the Rhode Island School of Design, where he graduated in 2007 with a Bachelor of Arts in film, animation and video.[6]

In mid-2014, Hyde started a web series titled Kickstarter TV, where he would find projects on Kickstarter and harshly ridicule both the projects and the people who made them.

In August 2016, Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace, a television program Hyde co-wrote and acted in along with the other members of MDE, premiered on Adult Swim.[7] Four months later, it was announced that World Peace would not be renewed for a second season. Hyde attributed the show's cancellation to his vocal support for Donald Trump.[8]

Later in 2016, Hyde published How to Bomb the U.S. Gov't, a comedy book he co-wrote with Rochefort, Carroll, and others.[9]

In 2017, Hyde reportedly pledged $5,000 towards the legal defense fund of Andrew Anglin, the founder and editor of white supremacist website The Daily Stormer.[2] The Southern Poverty Law Center sued Anglin for allegedly organizing a ""troll storm"" against a Jewish woman in Montana. When Matt Pearce of the Los Angeles Times questioned Hyde about the donation, Hyde asked Pearce if he was Jewish and went on to say that $5,000 was ""nothing"" to him. Hyde also stated: ""Don't worry so much about money. Worry about if people start deciding to kill reporters. That's a quote. For the reason why, you can say I want reporters to know I make more money than them, especially Matt Pearce.""[2]

Hyde lampooned the American anime fandom in 2012 when he delivered a spurious presentation titled ""Samurai Swordplay in a Digital Age"" under the pseudonym ""Master Kenchiro Ichiimada"" at a convention in Vermont. During the presentation, an MDE affiliate blocked the exit to bar attendees from leaving Hyde's hour-long performance.[10] Similarly in 2013, Hyde, while dressed in a maroon-colored sweatsuit and clad in hoplite-esque breastplate and greaves, delivered a prank TEDx talk titled ""2070 Paradigm Shift"" at Drexel University.[11] The talk, described by Forbes as a satiric impersonation of a ""Brooklyn tech hipster,"" received significant media attention.[12][11] When asked about the intent of the prank, Hyde stated his dislike for TED talks, calling them ""really self-congratulatory.""[13] In 2014, Hyde started a fake Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund the creation of a ""pony dating simulator"" for bronies, the adult male fans of the children's television show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.[11] The Kickstarter page said the simulator would comprise ""a journey that spans multiple continents"" and include ""deep RPG elements.""[14] Devotees of the show who ostensibly took the project seriously pledged a total of $4,161 to the phony fundraiser before Hyde cancelled it.[11][14]

Since 2015, Hyde has been frequently misreported as the perpetrator of numerous mass shootings and terrorist attacks by internet trolls on websites such as 4chan and Twitter.[11][15] The hoaxes, which typically included photos of Hyde brandishing a semi-automatic AK-47, reappeared so often on social media that The New York Times characterized ""Sam Hyde is the shooter"" as ""an identifiable meme.""[16] The first instance of the prank was the Umpqua Community College shooting. CNN mistakenly included Hyde's image on their coverage of the shooting.[17] Hyde was also erroneously blamed for many other shootings.[11][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]",mainstream
635,"“She must not know the internet keeps all the receipts,” the comedian Nick Jack Pappas tweeted the other day, referring to another comedian, Roseanne Barr.

The receipts were evidence of Barr’s history of hawking daft notions on Twitter, including Pizzagate. Pappas posted screenshots of Barr’s earlier tweets: ”#Sessions...will prosecute #HRC and make arrests over #PedoGate.” These “receipts” couldn’t be answered by denials, so Barr blocked Pappas.

Receipts are not just the output of cash registers anymore. They’re a vital piece of what might be called pop epistemology. About two years ago — in complex circumstances involving Kim Kardashian and Taylor Swift — “receipts” took on an almost cosmic significance. The takeaway was clear: If someone has been keeping receipts on you, watch out. The word has become a catch-all term for hard evidence.

Receipts include everything from diaries and contemporaneous notes to video, contracts and DNA. They are those incriminating records that checkmate. Lately it seems we’re craving receipts — anything to put an end to head-spinning relativism, alternative facts and the president’s unrelenting cacophony.

As Trump’s presidency drags on — having blown past tarnished and into deep, dark ignominy — receipts have become vitally important. They’re the key to blowing open the Trump syndicate, which seems committed to making history and truth “go away,” in the words of a Trumpworld lawyer.

“Access Hollywood” kept receipts. Long ago, Trump’s desperate crowing about crotch-grabbing surfaced in audio and video. His weak denials since then mean nothing. The recording is a receipt.

Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Florida) kept receipts. When Trump’s waning Chief of Staff John F. Kelly conjured some lies a year ago about Wilson’s remarks at the 2015 dedication of a new FBI building, her allies presented a video of her remarks that made Kelly look like a fabulist.

Colbie Holderness kept receipts. Her cache includes a memento related to her allegation that Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary, punched her in the face in 2005 while they were married. Trump had kept Porter on staff in spite of FBI warnings about his violent history, then Holderness submitted into evidence a photo of herself with a black eye. Porter’s effort to extenuate the receipt — “outrageous allegations … I took the photos given to the media …” etc. etc. — didn’t help. He was fired.

Karen McDougal kept receipts. The former Playboy model’s handwritten notes chronicle an alleged affair in 2006. These non-coy notes —“we got naked + had sex” — were published in the New Yorker. A White House rebuttal —“more fake news”— crashed on the shoals of receipts.

Stormy Daniels kept receipts. The adult-film actress has a copy of the nondisclosure agreement that she signed, and Trump didn’t, requiring her to keep silent about her alleged Trump tryst, on pain of larcenous fines. This week the president’s lawyer’s lawyer finally denied that Trump even knew about the contract. Legal experts, including former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, suggest the denial might void the contract and liberate Daniels to reveal more “material” she has hinted she has. Photos? Videos? In any case, receipts.

In the broader Trump circle — the Russia wing — a Nastya Rybka, a Belarussian escort, also kept receipts, including video footage apparently made while she was on a yacht with Sergei Prikhodko, Russia’s deputy prime minister, and Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska. (Deripaska is former employer and current creditor to Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman; the video was posted by Russian dissident Aleksei Navalny.) Now Rybka claims to have audio receipts that show Russian meddling in the U.S. election. She’s seeking asylum in the U.S. in return for telling all. Who knows if she has the goods, but Rybka’s receipts are worth watching for.

Even Tiffany Trump, the president’s younger daughter, has submitted a receipt. It’s a small one, to be sure, but last week, she “liked” an Instagram image that showed a demonstrator with a sign that read, “Next Massacre Will Be the GOP in the Midterm Elections.” It may be a record in the public square of her dissent from her father’s party. And maybe from her father.

Notice anything consistent about these receipts? For the most part, they were kept by women. When despots come to power, it’s often the marginalized — the escorts, the porn actresses, the ex-wives, the less-loved daughters — who maintain careful records, lest anyone try to silence them, deceive them or call them crazy.

Luke Harding, the author of “Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and how Russia Helped Donald Trump Win,” recently spoke to me about the role of women in exposing corruption and abuses of power in Russia. As Harding said, “One of the Putin regime’s weak points is its women, especially the 20-something mistresses and call girls who post their lives to Instagram and to social media.”

As the Trump investigation rolls on, it appears that prosecutors and journalists alike are heeding the Watergate-era injunction to “follow the money.” But we might also do well to follow the pulp-fiction maxim: Cherchez la femme. Find the woman.

She has the receipts.",mainstream
136,"A significant Australian proponent of the QAnon conspiracy theory is a family friend of Scott Morrison, and his wife is on the prime minister’s staff.

The sprawling, disjointed and incoherent QAnon conspiracy variously claims that Donald Trump is leading a behind-the-scenes fight against a shadowy deep state, that powerful forces are hiding and protecting satanic paedophile rings, and that a secretive individual named Q leaves clues for his followers to decipher on internet forums.

The FBI has previously warned that QAnon could act as a potential motivator for “domestic extremists” and last year Reddit banned one of its main QAnon threads for repeated violations of its content policy, warning it would not tolerate content “that incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses” users.

In Australia, one of the more significant QAnon figures tweets under the handle @BurnedSpy34 and has amassed 21,000 Twitter followers in just over a year. BurnedSpy tweets daily QAnon material, including bizarre theories about Alexander Downer and Julie Bishop.

The Guardian has learned the identity of BurnedSpy and established he is a longstanding family friend of the Australian prime minister and his wife, Jenny.

The wife of BurnedSpy works on the prime minister’s staff.

There is no suggestion that the families’ close relationship has influenced Morrison, or that BurnedSpy poses a danger. BurnedSpy told the Guardian he had never sought to speak to the prime minister about QAnon.

“I have never spoken to Scott about anything of a political nature. I’m not an adviser. The idea of me talking to him about this ... it’s just not true,” he said.

But some who know BurnedSpy have become concerned about the extent of his immersion in the QAnon theory, saying it may leave him open to influence by others.

The family friendship is largely driven by the closeness between BurnedSpy’s wife and Jenny Morrison.

The pair have been lifelong friends, and the Guardian has learned the wife was recently employed on the prime minister’s staff in a publicly funded position, but not in any policy or advisory capacity. There is no evidence she shares her husband’s views.

BurnedSpy’s tweets have frequently been cited as “world-class” in QAnon research threads on 8Chan, the forum Australian telecommunications companies were encouraged to block by Morrison’s government after it hosted the Christchurch terrorist attack videos.

BurnedSpy’s Twitter account makes repeated claims about Downer, a frequent target of QAnon. In a thread last year, he linked a 1996 child abuse inquiry in Australia to Downer’s role in kickstarting the Russian interference investigation.

“It’s no coincidence that Downer did NOT want Trump elected,” he tweeted.

He greeted this week’s news that Australia had offered assistance to the investigation into the Mueller probe, including Downer’s involvement, by tweeting “Game on!”.

BurnedSpy explained the tweet to the Guardian by saying: “So as for ‘game on’, for two years I’ve been interested in the Australian high commissioner to the UK’s involvement in what I consider as a coup against an incumbent sitting US president, I think that’s a story.”

There is no substance to his claims that Downer’s role in the Russia investigation had anything to do with child abuse, and no evidence that Downer did not want Trump elected.

BurnedSpy has also questioned whether the former Australian foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop was connected to the conspiracy through her wearing of red shoes.

“If you want to do your research into the US context, the red shoes are purported to be very much a paedophilia shout out,” he told the Guardian. “And there are some extremely odd photos of large groups of men in suits wearing red shoes, many of whom are promoting paedophilia.”

There is no evidence that Bishop is connected to any such conspiracy.

In other posts, he questioned whether 8Chan was taken offline after the Christchurch attacks because it was the only uncensored platform that Q could use.

The connections between his family and the Morrisons are long standing.

His wife has known Scott and Jenny since they were children, and is a close friend. The Guardian has seen multiple photos of the trio together. She attended their wedding and frequently interacts with Jenny Morrison on Facebook.

Photos also show BurnedSpy and Scott Morrison together.

One source close to BurnedSpy’s family, who asked not to be identified, expressed concerns about his immersion in QAnon material and warned he might be open to manipulation or influence.

“[His] beliefs have become more unusual and I have concerns about how easily [he] is influenced or infiltrated himself.”

The source said he was frequently heard making references to “great awakening” or “dark to light” – common refrains of QAnon – during conversation.

When contacted for comment, BurnedSpy accused the Guardian of preparing a “hit piece” on him.

He said his friendship with the Morrisons was unrelated to the Twitter account.

“I’m not going to diminish the relationship, that’s not appropriate either. Yeah we’re friends. That’s good. People have friends.”

BurnedSpy and his son, also a QAnon follower, have met prominent US-based QAnon figures.

The deceased US actor Isaac Kappy, a former QAnon proponent who frequently made unsubstantiated accusations of paedophilia against other Hollywood actors, met the pair when he came to Australia late last year.

TMZ last year reported that Kappy was the focus of a police investigation after threatening two celebrities and accusing one of paedophilia.

Also pictured at the meeting was Eliahi Priest, who has previously spoken at a rally for the True Blue Crew, a far-right Australian group.

BurnedSpy told the Guardian that Priest turned up at the meeting without his knowledge.

Priest was visited by the Australian federal police earlier this year after sending concerning emails to government officials. The officers asked Priest if he needed mental health support or counselling.

He claimed to have passed on information to Morrison, via the individual controlling the BurnedSpy account.

“I was hanging out with the prime minister’s best friend at his house in Sydney,” Priest said. “[He] was to pass this information to the prime minister, and he did.”

There is no evidence to substantiate Priest’s claims.

BurnedSpy told the Guardian he had met Priest only once – not intentionally – and had no ongoing association with him. The pair have now fallen out.

“He makes out that I’m part of [Morrison’s] political team,” he said. “Knowing someone is a far cry from … you know lots of people, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re invited to conversations and you’re allowed to offer an opinion without permission.”

BurnedSpy has also linked Hillsong, where Morrison has prayed, to mind control, and praised Morrison for his apology to child abuse survivors, during which the prime minister used the term “ritual sexual abuse”. The use of that term was interpreted by QAnon followers as referring to satanic ritual abuse.

He described the movement as “peaceful” and an alternative source of information, research and news for those who have lost faith in mainstream media. He said he had never been on the 8Chan forum and did not post there.

Experts say conspiracy theories such as QAnon risk leaving their followers polarised and shut off from the outside world, making them unpredictable.

Followers of the online “Pizzagate” conspiracy attacked Washington’s Comet Ping Pong restaurant in December 2016, believing internet rumours that prominent Democrats were harbouring child sex slaves there.

An armed QAnon follower blocked traffic at Hoover Dam in Nevada with an armoured truck in June 2018, calling for the release of the “OIG Report”, an unredacted Justice Department inspector general report which QAnon believes will expose a shadowy network entrenched in the government.

Australian National University associate professor Colin Klein, who has studied the varying belief systems behind conspiracy theories, said there was a risk when individuals began to believe ordinary sources of information were “unreliable and part of the conspiracy”.

“All-encompassing conspiracy theories insulate themselves from the world, which makes it much easier to become polarised and violent,” Klein said.",mainstream
721,"In the past six weeks, the Washington Post published two blockbuster stories about the Russian threat that went viral: one on how Russia is behind a massive explosion of “fake news,” the other on how it invaded the U.S. electric grid. Both articles were fundamentally false. Each now bears a humiliating editor’s note grudgingly acknowledging that the core claims of the story were fiction: The first note was posted a full two weeks later to the top of the original article; the other was buried the following day at the bottom.

The second story on the electric grid turned out to be far worse than I realized when I wrote about it on Saturday, when it became clear that there was no “penetration of the U.S. electricity grid” as the Post had claimed. In addition to the editor’s note, the Russia-hacked-our-electric-grid story now has a full-scale retraction in the form of a separate article admitting that “the incident is not linked to any Russian government effort to target or hack the utility” and there may not even have been malware at all on this laptop.

But while these debacles are embarrassing for the paper, they are also richly rewarding. That’s because journalists — including those at the Post — aggressively hype and promote the original, sensationalistic false stories, ensuring that they go viral, generating massive traffic for the Post (the paper’s executive editor, Marty Baron, recently boasted about how profitable the paper has become).

After spreading the falsehoods far and wide, raising fear levels and manipulating U.S. political discourse in the process (both Russia stories were widely hyped on cable news), journalists who spread the false claims subsequently note the retraction or corrections only in the most muted way possible, and often not at all. As a result, only a tiny fraction of people who were exposed to the original false story end up learning of the retractions.

Baron himself, editorial leader of the Post, is a perfect case study in this irresponsible tactic. It was Baron who went to Twitter on the evening of November 24 to announce the Post’s exposé of the enormous reach of Russia’s fake news operation, based on what he heralded as the findings of “independent researchers.” Baron’s tweet went all over the place; to date, it has been re-tweeted more than 3,000 times, including by many journalists with their own large followings:

But after that story faced a barrage of intense criticism — from Adrian Chen in the New Yorker (“propaganda about Russia propaganda”), Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone (“shameful, disgusting”), my own article, and many others — including legal threats from the sites smeared as Russian propaganda outlets by the Post’s “independent researchers” — the Post finally added its lengthy editor’s note distancing itself from the anonymous group that provided the key claims of its story (“The Post … does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot’s findings” and “since publication of the Post’s story, PropOrNot has removed some sites from its list”). What did Baron tell his followers about this editor’s note that gutted the key claims of the story he hyped? Nothing. Not a word. To date, he has been publicly silent about these revisions. Having spread the original claims to tens of thousands of people, if not more, he took no steps to ensure that any of them heard about the major walk back on the article’s most significant, inflammatory claims. He did, however, ironically find the time to promote a different Post story about how terrible and damaging Fake News is:

Whether the Post’s false stories here can be distinguished from what is commonly called “Fake News” is, at this point, a semantic dispute, particularly since “Fake News” has no cogent definition. Defenders of Fake News as a distinct category typically emphasize intent in order to differentiate it from bad journalism. That’s really just a way of defining Fake News so as to make it definitionally impossible for mainstream media outlets like the Post ever to be guilty of it (much the way terrorism is defined to ensure that the U.S. government and its allies cannot, by definition, ever commit it).

But what was the Post’s motive in publishing two false stories about Russia that, very predictably, generated massive attention, traffic, and political impact? Was it ideological and political — namely, devotion to the D.C. agenda of elevating Russia into a grave threat to U.S. security? Was it to please its audience — knowing that its readers, in the wake of Trump’s victory, want to be fed stories about Russian treachery? Was it access and source servitude — proving it will serve as a loyal and uncritical repository for any propaganda intelligence officials want disseminated? Was it profit — to generate revenue through sensationalistic click-bait headlines with a reckless disregard to whether its stories are true? In an institution as large as the Post, with numerous reporters and editors participating in these stories, it’s impossible to identify any one motive as definitive.

Whatever the motives, the effects of these false stories are exactly the same as those of whatever one regards as Fake News. The false claims travel all over the internet, deceiving huge numbers into believing them. The propagators of the falsehoods receive ample profit from their false, viral “news.” And there is no accountability of the kind that would disincentivize a repeat of the behavior. (That the Post ultimately corrects its false story does not distinguish it from classic Fake News sites, which also sometimes do the same.)

And while it’s true that all media outlets make mistakes, and that even the most careful journalism sometimes errs, those facts do not remotely mitigate the Post’s behavior here. In these cases, they did not make good faith mistakes after engaging in careful journalism. With both stories, they were reckless (at best) from the start, and the glaring deficiencies in the reporting were immediately self-evident (which is why both stories were widely attacked upon publication).

As this excellent timeline by Kalev Leetaru documents, the Post did not even bother to contact the utility companies in question — the most elementary step of journalistic responsibility — until after the story was published. Intelligence officials insisting on anonymity — so as to ensure no accountability — whispered to them that this happened, and despite how significant the consequences would be, they rushed to print it with no verification at all. This is not a case of good journalism producing inaccurate reporting; it is the case of a media outlet publishing a story that it knew would produce massive benefits and consequences without the slightest due diligence or care.

The most ironic aspect of all this is that it is mainstream journalists — the very people who have become obsessed with the crusade against Fake News — who play the key role in enabling and fueling this dissemination of false stories. They do so not only by uncritically spreading them, but also by taking little or no steps to notify the public of their falsity.

The Post’s epic debacle this weekend regarding its electric grid fiction vividly illustrates this dynamic. As I noted on Saturday, many journalists reacted to this story the same way they do every story about Russia: They instantly click and re-tweet and share the story without the slightest critical scrutiny. That these claims are constantly based on the whispers of anonymous officials and accompanied by no evidence whatsoever gives those journalists no pause at all; any official claim that Russia and Putin are behind some global evil is instantly treated as Truth. That’s a significant reason papers like the Post are incentivized to recklessly publish stories of this kind. They know they will be praised and rewarded no matter the accuracy or reliability because their Cause — the agenda — is the right one.

On Friday night, immediately after the Post’s story was published, one of the most dramatic pronouncements came from the New York Times’s editorial writer Brent Staples, who said this:

Now that this story has collapsed and been fully retracted, what has Staples done to note that this tweet was false? Just like Baron, absolutely nothing. Actually, that’s not quite accurate, as he did do something: At some point after Friday night, he quietly deleted his tweet without comment. He has not uttered a word about the fact that the story he promoted has collapsed, and that what he told his 16,000-plus followers — along with the countless number of people who re-tweeted the dramatic claim of this prominent journalist — turned out to be totally false in every respect.

Even more instructive is the case of MSNBC’s Kyle Griffin, a prolific and skilled social media user who has seen his following explode this year with a constant stream of anti-Trump content. On Friday night, when the Post story was published, Griffin hyped it with a series of tweets designed to make the story seem as menacing and consequential as possible. That included hysterical statements from Vermont officials — who believed the Post’s false claim — that in retrospect are unbelievably embarrassing.

That tweet from Griffin — convincing people that Putin was endangering the health and safety of Vermonters — was re-tweeted more than 1,000 times. His other similar tweets — such as this one featuring Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy’s warning that Putin was trying to “shut down [the grid] in the middle of winter” — were also widely spread.

But the next day, the crux of the story collapsed — the Post’s editor’s note acknowledged that “there is no indication” that “Russian hackers had penetrated the electricity grid” — and Griffin said nothing. Indeed, he said nothing further on any of this until yesterday — four days after his series of widely shared tweets — in which he simply re-tweeted a Post reporter noting an “update” that the story was false without providing any comment himself:

In contrast to Griffin’s original inflammatory tweets about the Russian menace, which were widely and enthusiastically spread, this after-the-fact correction has a paltry 289 re-tweets. Thus, a small fraction of those who were exposed to Griffin’s sensationalistic hyping of this story ended up learning that all of it was false.

I genuinely do not mean to single out these individual journalists for scorn. They are just illustrative of a very common dynamic: Any story that bolsters the prevailing D.C. orthodoxy on the Russia Threat, no matter how dubious, is spread far and wide. And then, as has happened so often, when the story turns out to be false or misleading, little or nothing is done to correct the deceitful effects. And, most amazingly of all, these are the same people constantly decrying the threat posed by Fake News.

A very common dynamic is driving all of this: media groupthink, greatly exacerbated (as I described on Saturday) by the incentive scheme of Twitter. As the grand media failure of 2002 demonstrated, American journalists are highly susceptible to fueling and leading the parade in demonizing a new Foreign Enemy rather than exerting restraint and skepticism in evaluating the true nature of that threat.

It is no coincidence that many of the most embarrassing journalistic debacles of this year involve the Russia Threat, and they all involve this same dynamic. Perhaps the worst one was the facially ridiculous, pre-election Slate story — which multiple outlets (including The Intercept) had been offered but passed on — alleging that Trump had created a secret server to communicate with a Russian bank; that story was so widely shared that even the Clinton campaign ended up hyping it — a tweet that, by itself, was re-tweeted almost 12,000 times.

But only a small percentage of those who heard of it ended up hearing of the major walk back and debunking from other outlets. The same is true of The Guardian story from last week on WikiLeaks and Putin that ended up going viral, only to have its retraction barely noticed because most of the journalists who spread the story did not bother to note it.

Beyond the journalistic tendency to echo anonymous officials on whatever Scary Foreign Threat they are hyping at the moment, there is an independent incentive scheme sustaining all of this. That Russia is a Grave Menace attacking the U.S. has — for obvious reasons — become a critical narrative for Democrats and other Trump opponents who dominate elite media circles on social media and elsewhere. They reward and herald anyone who bolsters that narrative, while viciously attacking anyone who questions it.

Indeed, in my 10-plus years of writing about politics on an endless number of polarizing issues — including the Snowden reporting — nothing remotely compares to the smear campaign that has been launched as a result of the work I’ve done questioning and challenging claims about Russian hacking and the threat posed by that country generally. This is being engineered not by random, fringe accounts, but by the most prominent Democratic pundits with the largest media followings.

I’ve been transformed, overnight, into an early adherent of alt-right ideology, an avid fan of Breitbart, an enthusiastic Trump supporter, and — needless to say — a Kremlin operative. That’s literally the explicit script they’re now using, often with outright fabrications of what I say (see here for one particularly glaring example).

They, of course, know all of this is false. A primary focus of the last 10 years of my journalism has been a defense of the civil liberties of Muslims. I wrote an entire book on the racism and inequality inherent in the U.S. justice system. My legal career involved numerous representations of victims of racial discrimination. I was one of the first journalists to condemn the misleadingly “neutral” approach to reporting on Trump and to call for more explicit condemnations of his extremism and lies. I was one of the few to defend Jorge Ramos from widespread media attacks when he challenged Trump’s immigration extremism. Along with many others, I tried to warn Democrats that nominating a candidate as unpopular as Hillary Clinton risked a Trump victory. And as someone who is very publicly in a same-sex, inter-racial marriage — with someone just elected to public office as a socialist — I make for a very unlikely alt-right leader, to put that mildly.

The malice of this campaign is exceeded only by its blatant stupidity. Even having to dignify it with a defense is depressing, though once it becomes this widespread, one has little choice.

But this is the climate Democrats have successfully cultivated — where anyone dissenting or even expressing skepticism about their deeply self-serving Russia narrative is the target of coordinated and potent smears; where, as The Nation’s James Carden documented yesterday, skepticism is literally equated with treason. And the converse is equally true: Those who disseminate claims and stories that bolster this narrative — no matter how divorced from reason and evidence they are — receive an array of benefits and rewards.

That the story ends up being completely discredited matters little. The damage is done, and the benefits received. Fake News in the narrow sense of that term is certainly something worth worrying about. But whatever one wants to call this type of behavior from the Post, it is a much greater menace given how far the reach is of the institutions that engage in it.",conspiracy

1310,"Over the past two years, a key event many bears have cited as a potential catalyst for the next market crash, is the systematic downgrade of billions of lowest-rated investment grade bonds to junk as a result of debt leverage creeping ever high, coupled with the inevitable slowdown of the economy, which would lead to an avalanche of “fallen angels” – newly downgraded junk bonds which institutional managers have to sell as a result of limitations on their mandate, in the process sending prices across the corporate sector sharply lower.

As we discussed in July, the scope of this potential problem is massive, with the the lowest-rated, BBB sector now nearly 60% of all investment grade bonds, and more than double the size of the entire junk bond market in the US, and 3.4x bigger than the European junk bond universe.

Yet after waiting patiently for years for the inevitable downgrade avalanche which would unleash a zombie army of fallen angels and potentially spark the next crash, with the occasional exception of a few notable downgrades such as PG&E and Ford, this wholesale event has failed to materialize so far, something which the bulls have frequently paraded as an indication that the economy is far stronger than the bears suggest.

But is it? And instead of the economy being stronger, are we just reliving the past where rating agencies pretended everything was ok until the very end, only to admit they were wrong all along, and then slash their rating retrospectively, too late however as the next financial crisis is already raging.

Well, according to a must-read expose by the WSJ, it appears that we are indeed doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past, because as the Journal’s Gunjan Banerji and Cezary Podkul observe, what was supposed to be a 2015 downgrade has dragged on for over 4 years… while the rating agencies appear to be purposefully looking elsewhere….",conspiracy
422,"After years of deflection and foot-dragging, the major tech companies are finally having to take steps toward policing their own content.

They have reached this point kicking and screaming, under great public pressure, after clinging for years to the fiction that they are just public utilities and that people can use their pipes for pretty much anything.

But now they have united, for a brief moment at least, against a major conspiracy theorist.

Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify have all taken action against Alex Jones.

They are deathly afraid of being accused of political bias, sometimes for good reason. Both Facebook and Twitter have both grappled with incidents of discrimination against conservatives, which may have made them gun-shy about banning (as opposed to shadow-banning) some folks.

But almost in unison, the tech giants teamed up against Jones, who runs Infowars.

Candidate Donald Trump appeared on Jones' online show in 2015, and yesterday Jones tweeted a video defense with the headline: ""EMERGENCY: President Trump Must Defend the First Amendment.""

Facebook said it has taken down some Jones pages ""for glorifying violence, which violates our graphic violence policy, and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies.""

Apple said it removed the ""Alex Jones Show"" and other podcasts from iTunes and its podcast app. The company said it ""does not tolerate hate speech, and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users.""

Google’s YouTube dropped the ax on Jones' channel, telling The Washington Post that it terminates users who violate ""our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures.""

And Spotify banned Jones altogether after earlier removing some podcasts, telling the Post: ""We take reports of hate content seriously and review any podcast episode or song that is flagged by our community.""

I know Jones has a lot of fans—remember the controversy swirling around his interview with Megyn Kelly—but he's also a guy being sued by Sandy Hook parents for saying that the horrible massacre at that Connecticut school was a hoax.

Jones apologized last year, in careful language, for spreading the phony Pizzagate conspiracy theory, saying he'd been given inaccurate information.

That’s not ""conservative."" That's at odds with reality.

Jones texted the Post that being banned by the tech companies was ""a counter-strike against the global awakening.""

""We've seen a giant yellow journalism campaign with thousands and thousands of articles for weeks, for months misrepresenting what I've said and done to set the precedent to de-platform me before Big Tech and the Democratic Party as well as some Republican establishment types move against the First Amendment in this country as we know it,"" he said.

Separately, Jones called The New York Times a ""globalist intelligence agency"" and said that the ""evil, wicked sociopaths"" who work for major media outlets were teaming up to take down Infowars.

I confess I'd like to know how the four tech companies happened to take action on the same day. Perhaps they concluded there was safety in numbers. They seemed to have an ally in Drudge, whose banner headline was ""APPLE REGULATES HATE.""

But this is just a skirmish. Just recently, Mark Zuckerberg got himself into trouble by saying he saw no reason to ban pages by Holocaust deniers.

There is a fine line between banning hate and bullying on one hand and censoring controversial political opinions on the other. These battles will play out in a hyperpartisan political atmosphere. But for now, Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify have all agreed there is one person who falls on the wrong side of that line.",mainstream

331,"Filmmaker, alien researcher and renowned radio host Steve Quayle says this is the year the truth is going to come out about aliens visiting earth. Quayle says, “The information is being released now by the same government that used to cover up every single UFO sighting, even when they started with ‘Project Blue Book.’ It wasn’t to answer the alien question, it was to control all the information of all the different sightings. The number one goal of the world control, I call them the fallen angel puppet masters, is to spin everything in history to their advantage. They want to destroy everything that is good and what God created. Every barrier, natural barrier, supernatural barrier and all of the barriers are being broken.”

Are we going to have the alien question answered this year? Quayle says, “Yes, and I think you are seeing it. . . . I believe before 2019 is up, somebody and I don’t know who . . . but there are two to three nations that are getting ready to release all of the artifacts and all of the film footage. They have been paid huge money to keep it under wraps. So, as Trump changes foreign policy and their money stops, this stuff is going to start to flow. I think 2019 is going to be the year of unparalleled revelation.”

Quayle says dark powers are wanting humanity to believe a huge lie–that aliens created us. Quayle says, “They say the aliens created us. Ancient alien theory is that the aliens, through a process called panspermia basically dumped DNA in the primordial goo and out popped man and me and you. I categorically reject that. When people tell me we were created by aliens and Jesus was alien, I say I’ve got news for you. You say god was an alien, then why all of the recorded ancient records always talking about the aliens with male and female sexual reproduction? . . . The big lie is the ancient aliens created us. The reason why they want us to believe the aliens created us is because it takes away from the thought of hell, it takes away from the need for salvation and it absolutely minimalizes the most important being in the universe, and that is Jesus. It teaches in the Bible that through Jesus and by Jesus all things exist. It is really hard for people to accept that. Now, the fallen angels are getting people to embrace Satan. . . . What you are seeing is a post-Christian culture in America. The enemy, the devil, is running wild with every form of perversion, every form of genetic mutation and every form of doing away with mankind. Look at sex robots. They are designed to do one thing and that is to displace human women.”

In closing, Quayle says, “I want to give a warning. . . . We are seeing the revelation that the aliens are finally real. . . . This is the perfect storm, and they are going to bring the aliens on as a savior. We rejected Jesus Christ as Savior, but somehow ‘digital nine’ from the planet Neptune comes and says we created you. If they created us, who created them? . . . This is a supernatural evil plan. The devil is going to use the aliens, and he’s already preparing people to accept the fact that we can’t save ourselves, and this planet is out of control and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and here they come. . . .The great deception is this: the God of the Bible isn’t the one who created us. That’s a lie. Jesus isn’t the Savior of the world and that’s the lie.”

987,"WASHINGTON — A man who police say fired an assault weapon inside a Washington pizza shop as he sought to investigate phony rumors of child sex trafficking has reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors.

At a status hearing Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, lawyers said they have reached a plea deal in principle for 28-year-old Edgar Maddison Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina.

Welch would face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of interstate transportation of a firearm, assault with a dangerous weapon and possessing a firearm during a crime of violence.

Terms of the plea were not discussed. Welch’s public defender, Dani Jahn, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington declined comment. After lawyers asked for more time to complete paperwork, U.S. District Judge Ketanji B. Jackson scheduled a plea hearing for March 24.

Authorities say Welch caused panic by firing multiple shots inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant on Dec. 4, after driving from North Carolina to investigate a conspiracy theory about high-profile Democrats harboring child sex slaves, with the pizza shop connected in some way.

Court documents indicate he entered the pizzeria carrying a .38 revolver in a holster on his hip and the AR-15 assault weapon across his chest. Authorities say he fired at a locked door as he searched for evidence of hidden rooms or tunnels.

According to court documents, Welch “surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.” No one was hurt.

Welch’s parents have said their son’s mood turned for the worse last year and he began having nightmares after he hit a 13-year-old pedestrian with his car in October.

468,"Over the last week, more than 18,000 acres of Southern California’s Cleveland National Forest have been torched and over 21,000 Riverside County residents have been evacuated from their homes as fire authorities struggle to contain what they’re calling the Holy Fire, which began in Holy Jim Canyon on Monday afternoon. The cause? Arson. And according to police, the man responsible lives in the only cabin in the canyon to be unaffected by the blaze. On Tuesday afternoon, Forrest Gordon Clark, 51, was arrested and charged with two counts of arson, one count of felony threat to terrorize, and one misdemeanor count of resisting arrest, and he could face life in prison if convicted.

According to fire authorities, Clark is suspected of setting the blaze in part because of a threatening email he allegedly sent to volunteer fire chief, Mike Milligan, which stated, “The place is going to burn.”

“Our strongest evidence is through our witness statements,” Orange County Fire Authority Battalion Chief Shane Sherwood said, according to The Desert Sun, noting that the felony threat to terrorize steams from threats that Clark allegedly made to neighbors. “We believe the fire was an intentional act.”

Sometime before his arrest, Clark gave a bizarre on-camera interview in which he denied knowing how the fire started, and then rambled about not having slept for 20 days and being targeted by gangs.

Milligan said that last week, Clark ran through the Holy Jim community screaming, and has a long history of feuds with his neighbors and local authorities. According to the Orange County Register, Clark has accused Milligan running drugs, claimed he could read minds, and in an encounter with police before his arrest, stripped off all his clothing. The newspaper’s review of court records revealed that a man with his same name and birthday was held involuntarily at a mental health treatment center in 1996, and in 2012, Clark’s mother was granted a temporary restraining order against her son, about whom she alleged, “There is no peace in my home when he is here.”

However, Clark’s biggest beef may be with, well, reality. JJ MacNab, a writer who focuses on anti-government extremism, gave Clark’s eight years of social media history a thorough review and discovered that he’d been active in the “sovereign citizen” movement since at least 2010, and was a member of an alternative-government group called the Republic of the united States of America (RuSA), which believes that the country has been under the control of an imposter government since 1871. Clark’s Facebook activity, she says, suggests he “believes in just about every kooky conspiracy out there, including QAnon, Pizzagate, Jade Helm 15, flat earth theories, NESARA, Jesuit conservancies, shape-shifting lizard overlords.”

“The guy was like a canary in a coal mine,” MacNab tweeted. “He was always one of the first true believers to glom onto whatever conspiracy theory was new and sexy that month.”",mainstream
562,"CNN's Jake Tapper confronted Vice President-elect Mike Pence during a Tuesday interview, grilling the head of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team over whether he was aware that Michael Flynn's son — who is in hot water over spreading a conspiracy theory that led someone to bring a rifle into a Washington DC pizza shop — had a security clearance requested for him.

Tapper reported earlier Tuesday that a source familiar with the situation said Trump's transition team requested a security clearance for Michael Flynn Jr., and that Trump gave a direct order to remove him from transition effort.

A firestorm ensued Monday over Flynn Jr.'s promotion of the ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theory, which baselessly alleged through a conspiracy that a pedophilia ring involving high-level Democratic Party officials — including Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta — was operating out of a Washington pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong.

On Sunday, police say, the conspiracy theory led an armed man to go to the pizzeria. The 28-year-old man carried an assault rifle to the restaurant and was looking to investigate the story himself, according to police.

""Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story,"" Flynn Jr. posted to Twitter. ""The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many 'coincidences' tied to it.""

As of Monday, Flynn Jr. had a government transition email, CNN reported. Flynn himself also shared a similar conspiracy theory on Twitter days before the November election that claimed Clinton was involved in sex crimes with children. Politico on Tuesday found that the incoming national security adviser had shared dubious news stories at least 16 times from his Twitter account since August.

During his interview with Pence, Tapper asked the vice president-elect to tell him ""what happened"" regarding Flynn Jr., who was said to have ""no longer"" been involved in the Trump transition effort by transition spokesman Jason Miller during a Tuesday conference call. Pence said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Tuesday that Flynn Jr. had ""no involvement in the transition team whatsoever"" as of that morning.

Pence insisted that Flynn's son was helping ""a bit"" with ""scheduling and administrative items"" but ""that's no longer the case.""

""Look, all — all of our families want to be helpful,"" Pence said, per a transcript. ""And four weeks to the day from Election Day there's been an awful lot of work to do. But — but — but Mike Flynn Jr. is no longer associated with Gen. Flynn's efforts or with the transition team.""

""You — you're downplaying his role, but you must be aware that the transition team put in for a security clearance for Michael G. Flynn, the son of Lt. Gen. Flynn,"" Tapper responded.

""Well, I'm — I'm aware in talking to Gen. Flynn that — that his son was helping with scheduling,"" Pence said back. ""Jake, his — his.""

""No, but you put in for a security clearance for him,"" he said.

""He's helping his dad arrange for meetings and provide meetings,"" Pence retorted. ""But that's no longer the case.""

Tapper fired back, asking if you need a security clearance to ""do scheduling?""

""I think that's the appropriate decision for us to move forward, avoid any further distraction,"" Pence replied, then reiterating his confidence in Trump.

""I want to move on to other issues, but I'm afraid I just didn't get an answer, which is were you aware that the transition had put in for a security clearance for Michael Flynn Jr.?"" Tapper persisted.

""You know, I've worked very closely with Gen. Flynn,"" Pence said. ""We've met on many occasions. I've — I've never — I've never seen his son present for any of those meetings.""

""But you're head of the transition team so you know who you put in security clearances for,"" Tapper pressed on.

""Well — well, Gen. — Gen. Flynn did inform me that his son was helping on administrative matters,"" the Indiana Republican said. ""But — but, Jake, this is all the kind of distraction that — that, frankly, I know, with all due respect, the national media likes to go chasing after.""

Tapper pushed forward with the line of questioning an additional time.

""The last question on this sir — and I'm sorry, it's just that you're not answering the question, which is were you aware that the transition team had put in for a security clearance?"" Tapper asked. ""I mean this is a young man who had a social media profile that had all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories ... all sorts of links and retweets with white supremacists. Were you aware that the transition put in for a security clearance for him?""

""Well, what I can tell you is that in — in talking with Gen. Flynn today, he made me aware that his son was assisting him in scheduling ..."" Pence answered.

""And then you put in for a security clearance,"" Tapper interjected.

Pence then launched into an extended answer:

"" ... meetings and well whatever the appropriate paperwork was to assist him in that regard. Jake, I'm sure ... was taking place. But that's no longer the case. And your viewers and the American people can be confident that we're going to — we're going to continue to drive forward.

Look, this is a very challenging time for America's place in the world. It was a week ago yesterday that we saw a terrorist-inspired attack on the Ohio State campus. We're bringing together with — with Gen. Flynn, with KT McFarland, with a team that's going to surround them and advise this president, people that are going to, going to set into motion. I'm confident, [in] the policies that will — that will make America safe again at home and abroad.""

""And it was just two days ago that we saw somebody with a gun go to Comet Pizza because of this crazy conspiracy theory that Michael G. Flynn had been putting out there, defended afterwards, and you guys put in for a security clearance,"" Tapper responded.

Watch part of the interview below:

Tapper confronted Flynn Jr. on Twitter Sunday following the armed man entering the pizzeria and Flynn Jr.'s subsequent defense of the conspiracy. He apparently direct-messaged Flynn Jr. on the app, asking for one piece of evidence proving that the pizza shop was ""the site of a satanic pedophilia cult."" Those direct messages were posted by another user.

""Michael — the police called pizza gate a fictitious conspiracy theory tonight,"" Tapper wrote. ""Does someone have to die before you take this s--- seriously. Spreading this nonsense is dangerous.""

""I want it to be false,"" Flynn Jr. responded.

""It is not the site of a satanic pedophilia cult,"" Tapper shot back. ""It is a f------ pizzeria. Show me what you're talking about that proves a satanic pedophilia cult. Your tweet is wildly irresponsible. Listen to me. You are going to get someone killed. Maybe an innocent child. For what??????""

Flynn Jr. later posted another screenshot of a DM thread with Tapper with the caption, ""Want evidence??? I must've really hit a nerve.""",mainstream
845,"Brian Wansink is a former American professor and researcher who worked in consumer behavior and marketing research. He is the former executive director of the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) (2007–2009) and held the John S. Dyson Endowed Chair in the Applied Economics and Management Department at Cornell University, where he directed the Cornell Food and Brand Lab.[1]

Wansink's lab researched people's food choices and ways to improve those choices. Starting in 2017, problems with Wansink's papers and presentations were brought to wider public scrutiny. These problems included conclusions not supported by the data presented, data and figures duplicated across papers, questionable data including impossible values, incorrect and inappropriate statistical analyses, and ""p-hacking"".[2][3][4][5][6][7] As of 2020 Wansink has had 18 of his research papers retracted (one twice), seven others have received an expression of concern, and 15 others have been corrected.[8] On September 20, 2018, Cornell determined that Wansink had committed scientific misconduct and removed him from research and teaching activities; he resigned effective June 30, 2019.[6]

Brian Wansink was born in Sioux City, Iowa.[9] He was raised in a blue-collar family and is the older brother of Craig Wansink,[10] a professor and chair of the Department of Religious Studies at Virginia Wesleyan.[11] Wansink received a B.S. in business administration from Wayne State College (Nebraska) in 1982 and an M.A. in journalism and mass communication from Drake University in 1984, followed by a Ph.D. in marketing (consumer behavior) in 1990 from Stanford Graduate School of Business.[1]

Wansink is married and has three daughters. His wife is a trained chef.[12]

Wansink's first academic appointment was to the faculty of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College (1990–1994). He then taught at the Wharton Graduate School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania (1995–1997) and went on to a position as a marketing, nutritional science, advertising, and agricultural economics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1997–2005) before moving to the Department of Applied Economics and Management in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University in 2005.[1]

He set up a nonprofit foundation to support his work in 1999.[9][10]

Wansink's research focused on ways people make choices—for example, how portion sizes affect food intake. Some of his work led to the introduction of mini-size packaging.[13] Another of his papers found that people who eat with someone who is fat will make worse food choices, which the UK National Health Service described as ""not wholly convincing and does not prove this phenomenon exists in the general population.""[14]

In 2005, Wansink's lab published experimental findings in a paper called ""Bottomless bowls: why visual cues of portion size may influence intake"". In this study, the lab built an apparatus containing a tube that pumped soup into the bottom of a bowl at a steady rate as the participant ate. Those who ate from the bottomless bowl ate more soup than those whose bowls were filled manually, thus making them more aware of the amount they ate.[15][16] In 2007, Wansink received the Ig Nobel Prize in nutrition for the ""bottomless bowls"" study.[17] The experiment's data and analysis were challenged as part of the review of Wansink's body of work that started in 2017.[18]

In 2006, Wansink published Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think.[13] It was described as a popular science book combined with a self-help diet book, as each chapter ends with brief advice on eating.[19] The book details Wansink's research into what, how much, and when people eat.[13][20] The book was cited by National Action Against Obesity as being helpful in efforts to curb obesity in the United States.[21]

Wansink was appointed as the executive director of the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion from November 2007 through January 2009. He was responsible for oversight of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, MyPyramid.gov, and various other food-related programs administered by the USDA.[22] In 2011, Wansink was elected to a one-year-term as president of the Society for Nutrition Education.[23]

In a 2009 paper retracted in 2018,[24] a team led by Wansink described their finding that calorie counts in The Joy of Cooking had gone up around 44% since the cookbook's first edition in 1936, and related this to the obesity epidemic. Over time this finding became a shorthand way to refer to the unhealthy Western pattern diet. The publisher of Joy of Cooking, John Becker, noticed that Wansink's sample size was small, consisting of only 18 recipes out of about 4500 that were published during the study time interval, and did his own analysis of changes in calories in the recipes. In 2017, after news of Wansink's research practices became widely discussed in the media, Becker sent his results to several statisticians, including James Heathers, a behavioral scientist at Northeastern University. Heathers found Wansink's conclusions to be invalid, and found a number of problems with Wansink's paper, including counting a whole cake as a ""serving"" and comparing a recipe for a clear chicken soup with one for gumbo.[25][26]

Wansink's second book, Slim by Design, was released in 2014. In the same year he ran a Kickstarter campaign and raised around $10,000 to fund a coaching program based on the book; as of February 2018 the program had not been produced.[27]

In 2017 Wansink's research came under scrutiny, leading to several retractions and corrections and an investigation by Cornell into the integrity of his work. In September 2018, Cornell determined that Wansink had committed scientific misconduct and removed him from all teaching and research positions; he was only allowed to help in investigations of his published work. He also resigned from the university, effective June 30, 2019.[6] After the announcement of his misconduct and resignation, Wansink acknowledged in emails to Buzzfeed that there had been some problems with his publications but also wrote, ""There was no fraud, no intentional misreporting, no plagiarism, or no misappropriation.""[6] Cornell released a summary of its investigation, in which it stated, ""The practices identified included data falsification, a failure to assure data accuracy and integrity, inappropriate attribution of authorship of research publications, inappropriate research methods, failure to obtain necessary research approvals, and dual publication or submission of research findings.""[28]

In January 2017, the validity of research from Wansink's labs was called into question by Jordan Anaya, Nicholas J L Brown, and Tim van der Zee, after Wansink had written a blog post about asking a graduate student to ""salvage"" conclusions from a study which had null results, subsequently producing five papers from it, all published with Wansink as co-author.[3] Van der Zee, Anaya, and Brown analysed four of the five papers (referred to as ""the pizza papers""), and found conclusions not supported by the data presented, and a total of 150 questionable numbers, such as impossible values, incorrect ANOVA results, and dubious p-values.[2][3] According to the critics, requests for access to the original data were denied by Wansink, who cited privacy issues regarding the anonymity of the participants. A February 2017 article in New York Magazine described the pizza papers as ""shockingly unprofessional"" and expressed concern over the journals that published them.[2][29]

In response, Wansink announced an in-depth review of the four disputed papers, after locating some of the original datasets,[30] and published a detailed response in March 2017.[3] A few days later, Cornell released a statement confirming that the university administration had conducted a preliminary investigation of Wansink's four pizza papers, and had not found evidence of scientific misconduct. The investigation did find multiple cases of self-plagiarism and confirmed ""numerous instances of inappropriate data handling and statistical analysis"", requiring Wansink to hire independent, external statistical experts to check and reanalyze his own review of the papers.[3][31]

Later in 2017, Anaya and his colleagues found errors in six other papers published by members of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab. As of December 2017, six papers had been retracted and 14 corrections had been issued.[32]

By March 2018, two more papers had been retracted and an additional correction made, bringing the total counts to 8 retractions (one paper retracted twice) and 15 corrections.[5] In April 2018, JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) issued a ""Notice of Expression of Concern"" about all six articles authored by Wansink in JAMA and JAMA network specialty journals, to alert the scientific community of concerns about the validity of Wansink's research; the notice included a request for Cornell to have the validity of the papers independently assessed.[33] In September 2018 JAMA retracted six papers by Wansink.[34]

610,"On February 7th of 1987, the Washington Post ran an interesting story that did not at the time seem to have any particular national significance. The article concerned a case of possible kidnapping and child abuse, and read (in part) as follows:

“Authorities investigating the alleged abuse of six children found with two men in a Tallahassee, Fla., park discovered material yesterday in the Washington area that they say points to a 1960′s style commune called the Finders, described in a court document as a ‘cult‘ that allegedly conducted ‘brainwashing‘ and used children ‘in rituals.’ D. C. police, who searched a Northeast Washington warehouse linked to the group removed large plastic bags filled with color slides, photographs and photographic contact sheets. Some photos visible through a bag carried from the warehouse at 1307 Fourth St. NE were wallet-sized pictures of children, similar to school photos, and some were of naked children. D.C. police sources said some of the items seized yesterday showed pictures of children engaged in what appeared to be ‘cult rituals.’ Officials of the U.S. Customs Service, called in to aid in the investigation, said that the material seized yesterday includes photos showing children involved in bloodletting ceremonies of animals and one photograph of a child in chains. Customs officials said they were looking into whether a child pornography operation was being conducted … Their links to the D.C. area have led authorities into a far-reaching investigation that includes the Finders – a group of about 40 people that court documents allege is led by a man named Marion Pettie – and their various homes, including the duplex apartment building in Glover Park, the Northeast Washington warehouse and a 90 acre farm in rural Madison County, Va. … The children, identified in a court document only by the first names of Honeybee, John Franklin, Bee Bee, Max and Mary, were described as ‘dirty unkempt, hungry, disturbed and agitated.’ They had been living in the rear of the van for some time, the document said. Yesterday, police spokesman Hunt said one of the children, a 6 yr. old girl ‘showed signs of sexual abuse’ … Five of the children were uncommunicative, according to police, and none seemed to recognize objects such as typewriters and staplers. However, the oldest was able to give investigators some information. She said that the two men ‘were their teachers,’ according to Hunt … Before their arrests in the park, [the two adult caretakers] had told police that they were teachers from Washington ‘transporting these children to Mexico and a school for brilliant children,’ according to Hunt. When police asked the men where the children’s mothers were they said they were being weaned from their mothers.” (1)

This was just one of many such stories that emerged across the country in the late 1980′s, a phenomenon that would be quickly be denounced as a ‘witch hunt’ and as a ‘Satanic panic.’ It would be nearly seven years before the press would revisit this particular manifestation of what would come to be regarded as a modern-day case of mass hysteria. It was the U.S. News and World Report that would ultimately provide the follow-up to the Finders story. But this was certainly not in the interest of shining any light on the earlier allegations. Most likely, the strange saga of the Finders would have disappeared forever if not for the rumors surrounding the case that just wouldn’t seem to go away.

These rumors were addressed in the News report as follows: “One of the unresolved questions involves allegations that the Finders are somehow linked to the Central Intelligence Agency. Custom Service documents reveal that in 1987, when Customs agents sought to examine the evidence gathered by Washington, D.C. police, they were told that the Finders investigation ‘had become an internal matter.’ The police report on the case had been classified secret. Even now, Tallahassee police complain about the handling of the Finders investigation by D.C. police. ‘They dropped this case,’ one Tallahassee investigator says, ‘like a hot rock.’ D.C. police will not comment on the matter. As for the CIA, ranking officials describe allegations about links between the intelligence agency and the Finders as ‘hogwash,’ perhaps the result of a simple mix up with D.C. police. The only connection, according to the CIA: A firm that provided computer training to CIA officers also employed several members of the Finders. (2)

It should probably be noted here that the firm that supplied the training didn’t just employ several members of the Finders but appears to have in fact been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Finders organization. It should also be noted that the CIA does not, as a general rule-of-thumb, assign the training of its officers to outside contractors. If a ‘private’ firm is utilized in such a capacity, it is in all such cases a front group of the CIA itself.

In the last paragraph of the U.S. News report, yet more intriguing connections to Langley are revealed. Speaking of group leader Marion Pettie, it is noted that “the CIA’s interest in the Finders may stem from the fact that his late wife once worked for the agency and that his son worked for a CIA proprietary firm, Air America.” Aside from acknowledging these by then widely known (in Washington, at least) CIA connections, the U.S. News reporters did their very best to bury this story once and for all, denigrating the sordid allegations leveled against the group seven years earlier. The article reads as follows:

“The case is almost seven years old now, but matters surrounding a mysterious group known as the Finders keep growing curiouser and curiouser. In early February 1987, an anonymous tipster in Tallahassee, Fla, made a phone call to police. Two ‘well dressed men’ seemed to be ‘supervising’ six disheveled and hungry children in a local park, the caller said. The cops went after the case like bloodhounds, at least at first. The two men were identified as members of the Finders. They were charged with child abuse in Florida. In Washington, D.C. police and U.S. Customs Service agents raided a duplex apartment building and a warehouse connected to the group. Among the evidence seized – detailed instructions on obtaining children for unknown purposes and several photographs of nude children. According to a Customs Service memorandum obtained by U.S. News, one photo appeared ‘to accent the child’s genitals.’ The more the police learned about the Finders, the more bizarre they seemed: There were suggestions of child abuse, Satanism, dealing in pornography and ritualistic animal slaughter. None of the allegations was ever proved, however. The child abuse charges against the two men in Tallahassee were dropped; all six of the children were eventually returned to their mothers, though in the case of two, conditions were attached by a court. In Washington, D.C. police began backing away from the Finders investigation. The groups practices, the police said, were eccentric – not illegal.” (2)

The article closed by noting that “some of the rumors can last an awfully long time.” Indeed they can, though the rumors would have to circulate outside of the media, which has never again mentioned the case. This does not mean though that there is no additional information available on the subject. As the News noted in their report, there is a certain Customs Service memorandum that was written at the time of the original investigation.

As this document was in the hands of the News reporters at the time the story was written, as is readily acknowledged, it should logically follow that any pertinent information contained therein would have been faithfully reported. And as we know, the News concluded that “none of the allegations was ever proved.” Still, it might be interesting to review the document to see what kind of “eccentric – not illegal” practices it was that the group was involved in. As luck would have it, I also happen to have a copy of the memo, which is actually a series of memos written by Ramon J. Martinez, Special Agent, United States Customs Service. In Martinez’s own words, this is what he observed during his participation in the investigation:

“On Thursday, February 5, 1987, this office was contacted via telephone by Sergeant JoAnn VanMETER of the Tallahassee Police Department, Juvenile Division. Sgt. VanMETER requested assistance in identifying two adult males and six minor children ages 7 years to 2 years.

“The adult males were tentatively identified by TPD as Michael HOULIHAN and Douglas AMMERMAN, both of Washington, D.C. who were arrested the previous day on charges of child abuse.

“The police had received an anonymous telephone call relative two well-dressed white men wearing suits and ties in Myers Park, (Tallahassee), apparently watching six dirty and unkempt children in the playground area. HOULIHAN and AMMERMAN were near a 1980 Blue Dodge van bearing Virginia license number XHW-557, the inside of which was later described as foul-smelling filled with maps, books, letters, with a mattress situated to the rear of the van which appeared as if it were used as a bed, and the overall appearance of the van gave the impression that all eight persons were living in it.

“The children were covered with insect bites, were very dirty, most of the children were not wearing underwear and all of the children had not been bathed in many days.

“The men were arrested and charged with multiple counts of child abuse and lodged in the Leon County Jail. Once in custody the men were somewhat evasive in their answers to the police regarding the children and stated only that they both were the children’s teachers and that all were enroute to Mexico to establish a school for brilliant children …

“U.S. Customs was contacted because the police officers involved suspected the adults of being involved in child pornography and knew the Customs Service to have a network of child pornography investigators, and of the existence of the Child Pornography and Protection Unit. SS/A Krietlow stated the two adults were well dressed white males. They had custody of six white children (boys and girls), ages three to six years. The children were observed to be poorly dressed, bruised, dirty, and behaving like wild animals in a public park in Tallahassee …

“SS/A Kreitlow was further advised the children were unaware of the function and purpose of telephones, televisions and toilets, and that the children had stated they were not allowed to live indoors and were only given food as a reward …

“Upon contacting Detective Bradley, I learned that he had initiated an investigation on the two addresses provided by the Tallahassee Police Dept. during December of 1986. An informant had given him information regarding a cult, known as the “Finders” operating various businesses out of a warehouse located at 1307 4th St., N.E., and were supposed to be housing children at 3918/3920 W St., N.W. The information was specific in describing ‘blood rituals’ and sexual orgies involving children, and an as yet unsolved murder in which the Finders may be involved. With the information provided by the informant, Detective Bradley was able to match some of the children in Tallahassee with names of children known alleged to be in the custody of the Finders. Furthermore, Bradley was able to match the tentative ID of the adults with known members of the Finders. I stood by while Bradley consulted with AUSA Harry Benner and obtained search warrants for the two premises. I advised acting RAC SS/A Tim Halloran of my intention to accompany MPD on the execution of the warrants, received his permission, and was joined by SS/A Harrold. SS/A Harrold accompanied the team which went to 1307 4th St., and I went to 3918/20 W St.

“During the execution of the warrant at 3918/20 W St., I was able to observe and access the entire building … There were several subjects on the premises. Only one was deemed to be connected with the Finders. [He] was located in a room equipped with several computers, printers, and numerous documents. Cursory examination of the documents revealed detailed instructions for obtaining children for unspecified purposes. The instructions included the impregnation of female members of the community known as the Finders, purchasing children, trading, and kidnapping. There were telex messages using MCI account numbers between a computer terminal believed to be located in the same room, and others located across the country and in foreign locations. One such telex specifically ordered the purchase of two children in Hong Kong to be be arranged through a contact in the Chinese Embassy there. Another telex expressed interest in ‘bank secrecy’ situations. Other documents identified interests in high-tech transfers to the United Kingdom, numerous properties under the control of the Finders, a keen interest in terrorism, explosives, and the evasion of law enforcement. Also found in the ‘computer room’ was a detailed summary of the events surrounding the arrest and taking into custody of the two adults and six children in Tallahassee the previous night. There were also a set of instructions which appeared to be broadcast via a computer network which advised the participants to move ‘the children’ and keep them moving through different jurisdictions, and instructions on how to avoid police attention …

“On Friday, 2/6/87, I met Detective Bradley at the warehouse on 4th Street, N.E. I duly advised my acting group supervisor, SS/A Don Bludworth. I was again granted unlimited access to the premises. I was able to observe numerous documents which described explicit sexual conduct between the members of the community known as Finders. I also saw a large collection of photographs of unidentified persons. Some of the photographs were nudes, believed to be of members of the Finders. There were numerous photos of children, some nude, at least one of which was a photo of a child ‘on display’ and appearing to accent the child’s genitals. I was only able to examine a very small amount of the photos at this time. However, one of the officers presented me with a photo album for my review. The album contained a series of photos of adults and children dressed in white sheets participating in a ‘blood ritual.’ The ritual centered around the execution of at least two goats. The photos portrayed the execution, disembowelment, skinning and dismemberment of the goats at the hands of the children. This included the removal of the testes of a male goat, the discovery of a female goat’s “womb” and the “baby goats” inside the womb, and the presentation of a goat’s head to one of the children.

“Further inspection of the premises disclosed numerous files relating to activities of the organization in different parts of the world. Locations I observed are as follows: London, Germany, the Bahamas, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Africa, Costa Rica, and ‘Europe.’ There was also a file identified as ‘Palestinian.’ Other files were identified by member name or ‘project’ name. The projects appearing to be operated for commercial purposes under front names for the Finders. There was one file entitled ‘Pentagon Break-In,’ and others referring to members operating in foreign countries. Not observed by me but related by an MPD officer were intelligence files on private families not related to the Finders. The process undertaken appears to be have been a systematic response to local newspaper advertisements for babysitters, tutors, etc. A member of the Finders would respond and gather as much information as possible about the habits, identity, occupation, etc., of the family. The use to which this information was to be put is still unknown. There was also a large amount of data collected on various child care organizations.

“The warehouse contained a large library, two kitchens, a sauna, hot-tub, and a ‘video room.’ The video room seemed to be set up as an indoctrination center. It also appeared that that the organization had the capability to produce its own videos. There were what appeared to be training areas for children and what appeared to be an altar set up in a residential area of the warehouse. Many jars of urine and feces were located in this area.” (3)

I’m going to go out on a limb here and guess that most people, upon reading this, will conclude that the practices of the Finders were not in fact merely “eccentric.” The last time I checked into it, running an international terrorist organization specializing in the trafficking of children was definitely illegal. Unless, that is, the organization doing the trafficking is run by the Central Intelligence Agency.

Group leader Marion Pettie shed additional light on his non-connections to the agency in an interview with Steamshovel Press in 1998. Recounting the history of his group, Pettie notes that: “Going back to World War II, I kept open house mainly to intelligence people in Washington. OSS people passing through, things like that.” (4)

He wasn’t, mind you, an intelligence asset himself. In fact, according to Pettie, he has spent his entire life trying – as a private citizen – to spy on the spies. As for his wife, he claims he sent her “in as a spy, to spy on the CIA for me. She was very happy about it, happy to tell me everything she found out. She was in a key place, you know with the records, and she could find out things for me.” (4)

Pettie also acknowledges that his “son worked for Air America, which was a proprietary of the CIA. There are some connections, but not to me personally.” (4) Of course not. In fact, Pettie is something of a CIA watch-dog, proclaiming that he has “been studying them since before they were born.”

“I was studying them back in the 30′s. It was ONI back then [Office of Naval Intelligence], and then the Coordinator of Information comes on, and after that it turns into the OSS and OSS turns into the CIAU and the CIAU turns into the CIA. So I’ve been studying that all of my life. But I wasn’t personally working for them.” (4)

Of course he wasn’t. I have no idea where anyone would get a crazy notion like that. Interestingly enough, though, this group which claimed no direct connection to the intelligence community quite obviously had very powerful people within that community protecting it. As the final Customs Service memo notes:

“On Thursday, February 5, 1987, Senior Special Agent Harrold and I assisted the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) with two search warrants involving the possible sexual exploitation of children. During the course of the search warrants, numerous documents were discovered which appeared to be concerned with international trafficking in children, high tech transfer to the United Kingdom, and international transfer of currency.

“On March 31, 1987, I contacted Detective Jim Bradley of the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). I was to meet with Detective Bradley to review the documents seized pursuant to two search warrants executed in January, 1987. The meeting was to take place on April 2 or 3, 1987.

“On April 2, 1987, I arrived at MPD at approximately 9:00 a.m. Detective Bradley was not available. I spoke to a third party who was willing to discuss the case with me on a strictly ‘off the record’ basis.

“I was advised that all the passport data had been turned over to the State Department for their investigation. The State Department in turn, advised the MPD that all travel and use of the passports by the holders of the passports was within the law and no action would be taken. This included travel to Moscow, North Korea, and North Vietnam from the late 1950s to mid 1970s.

“The individual further advised me of circumstances which indicated that the investigation into the activity of the Finders had become a CIA internal matter. The MPD report has been classified SECRET and was not available for review. I was advised that the FBI had withdrawn from the investigation several weeks prior and that the FBI Foreign Counter Intelligence Division had directed MPD not to advise the FBI Washington Field Office of anything that had transpired.

“No further information will be available. No further action will be taken.”

And with these rather cryptic words, the case of the Finders was permanently closed. So there you have it. The only question now remaining, I suppose, is simply this: how long can we – the American people – allow a government to stand that is so depraved, so fundamentally corrupt and criminal, so completely lacking in any semblance of morals or basic human decency that it would traffic in the minds and bodies of our children?

More reports surfaced that children were being stolen in South and Central America, flown across the border in light aircraft, and sold to child sex rings, or sold so their organs could be used in transplants.

There was no shortage of rumors about who was involved. One named was Air Force Colonel Phil Willer, a World War II veteran turned contraband-runner. His twin-engined Beechcraft had finally been shot down by a Mexican antiaircraft unit, crashing in flames. Willer died strapped into the cockpit. Ironically, there was no one else on board. But the story persisted that other fliers had inherited his role and substantial income. One was known as the Desert Jackal, a sixty-year-old American who learned his flying against the Japanese in the Pacific in World War II. Another had flown a helicopter gunship in Vietnam.

A pilot could make two thousand dollars on a ninety-minute round trip from some Mexican mountaintop or jungle clearing, skimming over the border to land at a remote landing strip in New Mexico or Texas.

Some made two or three flights a day. The more experienced used Beech 18s because of the aircraft’s capacity and maneuverability. The majority of the fliers were mercenaries who had flown for the CIA.",conspiracy
383,"The far-Right can be funny, in their way. Julia Ebner remembers when she pretended to be one of them. The first time she attended a meeting, it was in Mayfair, at a little pub called Ye Grapes. As she walked into the back room, the group were chatting about holidays in Hungary (“I only give my money to free nations”) and having to hide their political views (“You get fired here if you’re a Nazi”). The food at Ye Grapes is Thai. “There were so many surreal moments,” Ebner says about the two years she spent undercover, infiltrating a range of extremist movements both online and in the flesh. “It was hard, because I would sometimes think they were joking, but they were serious about things where it seemed too absurd to be true.” Ebner has written about her experiences in a new book, Going Dark. By day, she works at the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, an anti-extremism think-tank. By night, she was doing what she calls “completely separate” work. (As she puts it in the book: “During my working hours I was the cat, but in my spare time I joined the mice.”) The ironies, she found, were exquisite. After the Mayfair event, Generation Identity invited her to a meeting in Brixton, not an area known for hostility to multicultural life. (They holed up in an Airbnb.) Over coffee in Vienna with their regional leader, Edwin Hintsteiner, she raised suspicions by asking for soy milk – only to learn that at a party that night, the far-Right Freedom Party of Austria would be serving Club-Mate, a trendy energy drink from Berlin.

Online, where the absurdities of conspiracy theories such as QAnon or Pizzagate hold sway, the hypocrisy could be similarly complex. “For example,” Ebner says, “take the vetting procedures in some of the neo-Nazi channels. You have to submit a genetic test. But people come back – of course! – with results showing a small percentage of non-white background. Which opens up a discussion about the Jews controlling them.” Ebner wasn’t trained to enter these spheres. Her work was unsanctioned by the ISD. She was moving in the domain of intelligence officers or investigative journalists, who spend years learning how to work in the field. “There are moments in the book,” she admits, “where you can tell that I’m a complete amateur. That I didn’t go through any kind of MI5 training, or any investigative journalism training. “And there were definitely moments where I thought: ‘Maybe I’ve gone too far, maybe I shouldn’t have come here.’” At one point at the Brixton meeting, she drops a bank card that bears her real name. By chance, the woman who hands it back doesn’t look at it. These are not mistakes that a professional would likely make. “I did have an exit plan for all the events I went to,” Ebner says. “In my phone, I had people who were prepared to come to the Airbnb in Brixton if something happened.” In that case, she wasn’t scared. “With Generation Identity, I knew that their reputations would be at stake, so they wouldn’t do anything.” Not all her investigations felt so safe. In the German town of Ostritz, for instance, Ebner attended Schild & Schwert (Shield and Sword), a neo-Nazi rock festival held on Hitler’s birthday, April 20. “There,” she recalls, “I knew that some people had criminal records. Everyone was checked by the police on entering. And these people could potentially use violence.” Once again, her façade had cracks. She wore black Adidas trainers, but New Balance is the alt-Right fashion; she didn’t know how to dance to neo-Nazi hardcore rock. This time, it would have been harder to laugh and walk away.

“I thought: ‘OK, in the worst-case scenario, I’m going to take a punch.’ I didn’t think anyone was going to kill me, even if they found out who I was. But taking a punch was something that I mentally prepared for.” Before long, one neo-Nazi accosted her and refused to leave her alone. She pretended to be 23, and feigned what she calls a “bogus naivety” – but he was bemused by her lack of knowledge. She didn’t know, for example, about how Helmut Kohl and Mikhail Gorbachev sold out the German race. This time she needed her exit plan – “someone waiting outside with a car” – and had to escape. Going Dark is impressive in moments like this, when Ebner is less offended or angry than disappointed in those she meets. Even her harasser is portrayed as he was: calmly described, no caricature. This, she says, was a conscious choice. “It’s counterproductive to denounce them as individuals. We can denounce the ideologies, or conspiracy theories. But it doesn’t help with getting people back from the radical fringes if we humiliate them or denounce them on an individual level, or attack them personally.” She even felt sad, when embedded in Generation Identity. “There were some very young individuals in that movement. You could see that Generation Identity made an effort to bring that into their media campaigns – which would also make it impossible for them to leave any more. There were moments where I wanted to say, ‘Please leave now.’” And yet, she never did. In part, Ebner admits, it was a cold strategic choice: preserve her cover, or save a soul.

“There were moments when I did want to debunk conspiracy theories, or tell someone to leave. I could have done that. But I thought it was more valuable to stay there, collect all the information I could, then hopefully inform a bigger intervention programme with a wider scope.” Nor, she points out, was she trained in deradicalisation any more than she was in undercover work. “I’d prefer to leave that task to professionally trained psychologists and intervention providers. I saw my role as that of a researcher. That’s what I’ve done at Quilliam and the ISD.” It was during her time at Quilliam, the think-tank where she worked until 2017, that Ebner was dragged into the news. In May that year, she wrote a piece for The Guardian in which she connected Tommy Robinson and the phrase “white supremacist movements”. Robinson declared on video that he was going to confront her, and he did. Entering Quilliam’s building, he found Ebner, a scuffle broke out with security, and he was thrown out, camera in hand, exactly as he wished. Ebner had the data to prove that – as she told Quilliam CEO Haras Rafiq afterwards – “Robinson’s support base overlaps with that of white supremacist movements”. Quilliam wanted the hostilities to go away. Ebner stood by her position, and wouldn’t sell The Guardian out. The next day, she was fired. Robinson, as he likes to say, is a campaigner for “freedom of speech”. Yesterday, he joined Toby Young’s Freedom of Speech Union, and Young says he’s welcome there. It exemplifies another of the ironies Ebner found: those with the strongest positions are often papering over their cognitive dissonance. She takes the example of free-speech warriors online. “On the one hand they say that they’re being shut down, that they’re the victims of infringement of freedom of speech – but on the other hand, they’re launching intimidation campaigns that are meant to silence their political opponents.

“These things,” she says wryly, “are a bit like going to a Thai restaurant to speak about the Great Replacement, or going to Brixton for a Generation Identity meeting.” Not impossible, just moral hypocrisy. All Ebner’s undercover work involved what she calls “an ethical line”. She drew it at “anything that would help them expand their reach or get recruits”, and this put an “expiry date” on each of her attempts. “For example, I wouldn’t have helped with running any campaigns, or reaching out to people during recruitment. Even when they asked me whether I could translate some materials, some campaign materials from German to English, I wouldn’t have done that.” Her ethics also killed some of her budding plans. “Not all of the groups I tried are in the book. In some of them, I was kicked out too early to get any deeper insights, because I refused to do certain things. For example, creating my own racist memes, or attacking a political opponent on Twitter with vile messages.” Even so, I wonder, was that ethical line ever perfectly firm? Ebner pauses, and picks her words. “I think there are always grey zones. Even laughing at a joke, or nodding at a statement – even if you don’t say anything, simple approval or applause can confirm people’s views and make them more willing to show off. “That’s the problem on some of these messaging boards – they have a big audience who glorify them. I wouldn’t say that at any point I glorified anyone. But they do play to their audience. Not every user on these platforms is participating, but even by passively giving their confirmation or approval, they play into the radicalisation engine.” Ebner wants us to practice “civil courage”, and not assume that the intelligence services will handle extremism on our behalf. “Everyone has the responsibility to protect themselves and people in their surroundings from being lured into these networks.

“We often have civil courage on the Tube – if someone gets attacked, someone steps in – but we don’t often see it in online spaces when someone’s being attacked. Not yet.” Working undercover, she concedes, has changed her. She felt close to being seduced, having seeds planted that might be hard to uproot. Infiltrating a “trad wives” group online – the Red Pill Women – she found female misogynists who “ranged from ultra-conservative women – and to be fair, it’s everyone’s right to hold those views – all the way to endorsing domestic violence.” Ebner, who calls herself a feminist, was primed to disagree all the way. These women talked about women’s sexual value to men; the need to be docile and marketable. And yet: Ebner, who had just emerged from a break-up, felt unsettled by some of their other claims about “the burdens that women face in today’s modern world, or about hook-up culture and online dating apps”. “Mostly,” she remembers, “it felt like they were speaking about topics so close to my own worries and my own frustrations. I’d never been able to identify with the topics talked about in jihadist groups or in neo-Nazi groups – there were no topics there that touched me on a deeper emotional level.” Nobody, she tells me again and again, is immune to being radicalised. It isn’t a problem for other people’s minds, and you don’t always see the angle from which it comes. Ebner relied on a “safety net”: an informal debriefing process with colleagues at the ISD. “There were counter-extremism experts who would have been able to spot the signs if I were going in that direction.” After two years of undercover work, Going Dark is the end of Ebner’s shadow-career. Even during that period, she grew liable to be unmasked. After the real name of “Jennifer Mayer” was revealed, Generation Identity sent Ebner a glacial message saying they “hope it was at least interesting” for her to meet them. “Today,” she says, “in the English- and German-speaking world, it’s virtually impossible for me to go undercover offline – unless I wear a full-face mask. “And I’m not sure I would want to do that work any more.” Nor, she adds, would she ask others to follow her lead. “I wouldn’t recommend doing it offline. I don’t think everyone needs or wants to take that risk – the risk of having their face out there.” Going Dark: The Secret Social Lives of Extremists is published by Bloomsbury at £16.99.

580,"These are heady times for the likes of Roger Stone, Alex Jones, Julian Assange, Mike Flynn Jr., the alt-right, and others who might normally be relegated to the fringes of American politics. People like these have taken on a new importance in the age of Trump, a boundary-smashing political figure who has brought a most unexpected band of supporters into the mainstream, and whose rise has resulted in the blossoming of a series of connections between them. These figures are poised to enjoy unprecedented prominence and influence during Trump’s presidency.

“We are now the mainstream,” Stone told me. “CNN and the New York Times - they are the fringe.”

Take Stone and Jones. The pair enjoy a strong working relationship, with Stone appearing often on Jones’s Infowars show and hosting is own hour on the network once a week.

Jones is the premier voice in the 9/11 truth movement that argues that the September 11 attacks were an inside job, as well as a leading proponent of a multitude of other conspiracy theories. He has said he believes, for example, that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax. He’s made similar statements about the Boston Marathon bombing and a series of other tragedies. He’s also been a rock-solid Trump supporter, championing Trump as a man of the people who will stand up to globalist elites.

Jones’s reputation as America’s premier conspiracy theorist hasn’t stopped Trump, who has a penchant for conspiracy theories himself, from directly interacting with him. In December of last year, he went on Jones’s show, telling him “your reputation’s amazing.” Jones returned the favor, telling Trump that 90 percent of his audience was made up of Trump supporters—an estimate that takes on greater significance in retrospect. The person responsible for setting up the interview was, of course, Roger Stone.

Jones was in Washington for the inauguration, seemingly everywhere, following protests and even doing a surprise interview of a clearly uncomfortable Senator Ted Cruz in a chance encounter in a hotel elevator. Jones broadcast from outside the inauguration, surrounded by onlookers in Trump hats. At one point, he took a question from a man who identified himself as a Breitbart reporter. “What did you think of the speech today? He really laid the wood to ‘em,” the reporter asked.

“He just brought everything George Washington envisioned back, America 2.0, and just basically rebooted and launched the system, and it came out of there like a fiery phoenix, a fire-breathing dragon,” Jones responded. “The globalists are crapping their drawers right now. This was pure Americana, and trailblazing, and science, and vision, and absolutely empowering this country.”

“A global tipping point has been reached,” Jones told me, in the form of a 36-second audio clip sent by a spokesman after this story was published. “Humanity is now seeking out information and news for themselves and not just blindly accepting whatever the corporate press attempts to shovel down their throats. There is a new reformation taking place in the minds of the people against the old status quo and the old orders. This is a true rebellion against the elites.”",mainstream
1183,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called ""fake news"" a danger that must be addressed quickly, in a rare public appearance on Thursday, a month after she lost the presidential election in a campaign marked by a flood of such propaganda.

""We must stand up for our democracy,"" Clinton said during a tribute to retiring Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, referring to what she called ""the epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year.""

Clinton urged action from both the private and public sectors to combat the false reports.

""It's now clear that so-called 'fake news' can have real-world consequences. This isn't about politics or partisanship. Lives are at risk. Lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days, to do their jobs, contribute to their communities,"" she said.

Clinton herself has been a target of fake news, with internet postings claiming that a pizza restaurant in Washington was fronting a child sex ring run by Clinton.

On Sunday, a North Carolina man wielding an assault rifle fired a gun inside the restaurant, located in northwest Washington just a few miles from Thursday's ceremony, according to police, who said the suspect told them he had come to ""investigate"" a fake news report.

Clinton's appearance at the Thursday event, packed with mostly Democratic elected officials including Vice President Joe Biden, was greeted with a standing ovation and raucous applause.

Clinton, also a former senator who served with Reid, made a wry reference to the relatively low profile she has kept since Republican Donald Trump won the Nov. 8 presidential election, referring to ""a few weeks of taking selfies in the woods.""

She indirectly acknowledged her defeat as she began her tribute to Reid: ""This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol I hoped to be making after the election.""

The new U.S. president delivers an inaugural address on Jan. 20, standing on a large platform erected every four years on the west front of the Capitol building.

366,"The teenagers' scheme was straight out of NBC's To Catch a Predator. After meeting an older man online and learning that he was “looking for under-aged girls to have sex with,” authorities said, they lured him to an anonymous Starbucks in the far-flung suburbs of San Diego, where they planned to expose him as a paedophile and hand him over to the cops.

But on Sunday afternoon, when the sting was supposed to take place, things quickly spiralled out of control. The intended target, 32-year-old Robert Dreyfus, convinced one of the teens to get into his car “to talk,” the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said. Then, he drove off with the 17-year-old girl.

Amateur sex stings targeting potential predators are a growing trend, and authorities are now pointing to Sunday's alleged kidnapping as a prime example of why they're a bad idea. Though cops soon came to the rescue - the 17-year-old managed to send a text message to her friends, who called 911 - officials warned on Monday that online vigilantes who try to stage public confrontations are putting themselves in serious danger.

The social media-fuelled phenomenon has become a source of frustration for law enforcement officials nationwide. Loosely inspired by the short-lived but wildly popular NBC show, which was cancelled in 2008 after a suspect committed suicide, so-called “predator hunters” troll dating sites and apps favoured by teens. Using fake photos and identities to pose as underage, they convince their targets to meet them in a public place. Often, the ensuing confrontation is broadcast live on Facebook, with commenters rushing to identify the alleged predator.

Though some busts have led to arrests and guilty pleas, aspiring undercover sleuths have also wound up settling lawsuits for defamation, or getting punched. Police have repeatedly warned the amateur crime-fighters that they are putting themselves at risk by entering a volatile situation that would ordinarily call for backup and body armour, and that there's a good chance that the “evidence” they are gathering may not actually be legally admissible in court.

Predator hunters have also come under fire for publicly shaming people who have not yet been charged or convicted of a crime, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Last year, a 20-year-old Connecticut man committed suicide after he was confronted by a live-streaming vigilante from a group called POPSquad, who had posed as a teen boy to lure him to an empty house.

An NBC News investigation in January found more than 30 similar predator-hunting groups on Facebook, spanning 23 states. Though some individual posts and accounts, and one of the groups, were removed from the platform in January after the outlet questioned whether the online vigilantes' tactics amounted to cyberbullying, they've continued to proliferate. Steven Kohm, a cultural criminologist at the University of Winnipeg, told NBC News that the fad could be linked to the same mistrust in authority that has spawned conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and QAnon, as well as a desire for mob justice.

“Criminal justice used to be emotional and participatory,” Mr Kohm explained. “Over the last 100 years, it's become mostly hidden and dominated by professionals. People are yearning to reconnect with the punitive emotional core of the justice system. These groups focusing on the paedophile, a universally reviled category, helps them connect with the lost aspect of the justice system.”

Online predator hunters argue that their work is necessary because police aren't doing enough to stop potential paedophiles. “I say there is a bigger problem than police can handle, and citizens who have some training should be able to assist police like this,” Anthony Greene, the founder of Truckers Against Predators, recently told the Springfield News-Leader.

The Missouri-based trucker, who himself is a survivor of abuse, told the paper that he has conducted more than 100 sting operations in the past year, orchestrating meet-ups wherever his work takes him. Men show up thinking they are going to have sex with a teen girl, only to be greeted instead by a burly, 300-pound trucker. In June, a man who Mr Greene confronted at a truck stop in Yuma, Arizona, was sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty of luring a minor for sexual exploitation.

“I feel like the cause is worth it,” Mr Greene told the News-Leader. “Our kids are worth it. Something needs to be done more about these paedophiles.”

Greene and other predator hunters are eager to share their findings with the police, handing over reams of videos, photos, and potentially compromising messages. But if law enforcement officials don't seem appreciative, it's because actually securing a conviction is somewhat more challenging. Citizen vigilantes who belong to groups with names like “Parents Against Predators Nationwide” and “417 Predator Hunters” generally haven't been trained on how to conduct an undercover investigation, and authorities sometimes find that there simply isn't enough evidence to justify pressing charges.

In other cases, prosecutors' hands are tied. In Missouri and Ohio, for instance, an individual can only be charged with child enticement if their victim is a minor, or an undercover law enforcement officer posing as a minor. Adults who take it upon themselves to pose as teens aren't doing police any favours, and some officials worry that the highly-publicised amateur stings may actually do more harm than good since they run the risk of sending suspected paedophiles underground.

“What they're doing is of zero impact to law enforcement,” one Ohio investigator told the Cincinnati Enquirer last year. “They're not generating anything we can use.”

Still, stories about civilians bringing down alleged predators often make for great headlines. In 2017, an Oklahoma father discovered that his 15-year-old daughter was exchanging sexually explicit text messages with a 33-year-old man, and posed as the teenager to lure the older man to a tent in their backyard for sex. Several family members who were lying in wait pounced on the man when he arrived, then zip-tied his hands and feet to make sure he couldn't escape before cops arrived. It's unclear if the man ever faced criminal charges.

Another high-profile bust took place this summer, when a 20-year-old man in the San Francisco Bay area used Snapchat's gender-swap filter to pose as a teenage girl, then took screen shots of the sexually explicit text messages that were allegedly sent to him by a local cop and handed them over to law enforcement. Though the officer was arrested and placed on leave, local prosecutors later emphasised that they strongly discourage other civilians from trying the same tactic at home.

Sunday's failed sting exemplified the dangers of a DIY approach to criminal justice, but it did lead to a rare arrest: Dreyfus was jailed on suspicion of kidnapping, sending harmful matter to a minor and communication with a minor for specific offences. It's not clear whether he has an attorney.

Though the 17-year-old girl was unharmed, officials took the opportunity to warn any other aspiring sleuths that undercover investigations are best left to the professionals.

“The Sheriff's Department strongly discourages the public from setting up meetings or contacting anyone for the purpose of catching an individual who is committing a crime,” officials warned on Monday. “These types of situations can be extremely dangerous and should be handled by your local law enforcement agency.”",mainstream
201,"Tommy Robinson, founder of the far-right English Defence League, is to give a talk to one of America’s most prestigious universities.

Mr Robinson, 34, who has repeatedly been accused of stoking Islamophobia, will address students of traditionally liberal, Ivy League Columbia University on Tuesday in a talk provocatively entitled: “The fall of Europe – mass immigration”.

His talk will be the start of a succession of controversial hard-right figures addressing students at the university whose alumni include Bill Clinton’s former secretary of state Madeleine Albright.

On 30 October students will hear from Mike Cernovich, who helped fuel the “pizzagate” conspiracy theory in which Democrats linked to Hillary Clinton were falsely accused of child sex trafficking – and who has also been lavishly praised by the US president’s son Donald Trump Jr.

The Columbia University College Republicans club, which is organising both talks, described Mr Robinson as “an important political figure in England and Europe”, who has “championed the notion that radical Islam is incompatible with Western values and the freedoms we currently enjoy”.

It also claimed Mr Robinson “has been jailed unfairly due to his politics, which should frighten any American who values freedom of speech.”

The promotional material gave no explanation as to when or where Mr Robinson might have been “unfairly jailed”.

Nor did it mention that the EDL founder was jailed for 12 months for a drunken assault in 2005, jailed again in January 2013 for using someone else’s passport to enter the US illegally, and again in January 2014 for his part in a £160,000 mortgage fraud.

Mr Robinson, who founded the EDL in 2009 but left the street-protest group in October 2013, has repeatedly been accused of making inflammatory and divisive statements about Muslims.

The day after the Manchester Arena attack, he made an online video in which he stood outside a mosque in the city, alleging that 16 people within a two-mile radius had fought for Isis, and claiming: “In these houses are enemy combatants.”

In another video, he claimed Government “inaction” against extremism would lead to a “disgruntled and angry population cleaning out this Islamic problem”.

On Saturday Mr Robinson took a camera crew to London’s Natural History Museum, where a car had mounted the pavement.

He was filmed talking about “what looks like a suspected jihad attack... black male, possibly a convert, probably will turn out to have been on our watchlist.”

Police later ruled out any link to terrorism and confirmed the incident was being treated as a road-traffic matter.

Mr Robinson, however, has insisted he has never incited hatred or violence, claiming he was just warning about the kind of “sectarianism” that might lead to “idiots” attacking the Muslim community because they felt the Government was doing nothing about Islamist extremism.

He now plans to launch his new book – Mohammed’s Koran: Why Muslims Kill For Islam – in Manchester – despite criticism from Mancunians and Dan Hett, whose brother died in the arena attack.

In addition to the offences for which he was jailed, Mr Robinson has a conviction for leading Luton Town football supporters in a 100-person mass brawl with rival fans, during which a court heard he had chanted the words “EDL til I die”.

After being given community service and a three-year ban from attending football matches in July 2011, he claimed outside court to be the victim of the British “police state” because he thought he was being prosecuted for “what I am saying rather than what I am doing”.

The claim he has been “jailed due to his politics” may be a reference to the time in September 2011 that he was remanded in custody and went on hunger strike after breaching bail conditions by attending an EDL rally while awaiting court proceedings for assaulting a fellow EDL member.

Mr Robinson was subsequently convicted and given a suspended jail sentence for headbutting the EDL man. A Bedford Prison source told Luton Today: “His hunger strike only lasted 24 hours and then he gave up.”

Mr Robinson has also said he spent three days in a “grimy prison” in Switzerland before being fined for a rooftop protest at Fifa’s Zurich headquarters in which he and a fellow EDL member demanded England footballers be allowed to wear poppies on their shirts.

In October 2014, after being released from jail part-way through his mortgage fraud sentence, he was jailed yet again for breaching the terms of his licence.

Mr Robinson claimed his licence conditions included that he refrain from contact with the EDL. He said he had been recalled to prison because “I responded to a death threat targeting my family”.

Without offering detailed evidence, he told his 12,000 twitter followers that his rearrest was also related to him being due to speak at the Oxford Union “exposing police persecution”.

Given Mr Robinson’s criminal record, it is thought he will travel be unable to travel to the US in person and will instead address students via Skype.

Campaigners including the Southern Poverty Law Center Chapter at Columbia and Black Lives Matter of Greater New York are planning to protest at what they called “hateful and divisive rhetoric which does not align with the values of the university”.

CUCR, however, has said: “We’re proud of our efforts to provide a conservative voice on an overwhelmingly liberal campus and to defend free speech.”

CUCR president Ari Boosalis, a finance student, told DNAinfo New York: “I don’t agree with all my speakers on every point, but it’s important for that conversation to happen.

“A lot of people that represent middle America and those types of voters, they’re not represented at this school at all, and this is an opportunity for students to confront those views.”

Mr Robinson rushed to the Natural History Museum on Saturday after being enthusiastically received by some supporters at a march in London organised by the recently-formed Football Lads Alliance.

The march was said to be against all forms of extremism, but after The Independent reported on it, Mr Robinson tweeted that “Every lad I spoke to was there to oppose Islam”.",mainstream
952,"WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The White House on Monday condemned a surge in politically motivated fake news after one such bogus story allegedly prompted a man to walk into a crowded Washington pizzeria and fire a gun.

A North Carolina man was arrested at the Comet Ping Pong restaurant on Sunday after he showed up with an assault rifle. The man said he wanted to investigate reports that claimed the restaurant was the hub of a child sex ring organized by former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Police arrested him and the incident ended without bloodshed.

“There’s no denying the corrosive effect these false reports have had on our political debate. And that’s concerning in a political context,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a briefing. “It’s deeply troubling that some of these false reports could lead to violence.”

The restaurant and its workers were the target of social media threats ahead of the Nov. 8 election after fake news stories, known as “Pizzagate,” claimed that Clinton and her campaign chief John Podesta were running a child sex ring out of the pizzeria.

The Comet Ping Pong case was one example of a proliferation of fake news reports during the election year, often disseminated through websites purporting to be news outlets and quoting unnamed or bogus sources.

The suspect in Sunday’s incident was Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, of Salisbury, North Carolina. He was accused by police of assault with a dangerous weapon, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, and other charges. Police seized an AR-15 military-style rifle, a .38-caliber handgun and a shotgun.

It was not immediately known if Welch had a lawyer.

Welch pleaded guilty in 2013 to a misdemeanor charge of driving while impaired, a clerk with the Rowan County Court in North Carolina said.

Hours after Sunday’s incident, the bogus sex ring story was given a boost by Michael Flynn Jr., the son of retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, Trump’s pick to be his national security adviser.

“Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it’ll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many ‘coincidences’ tied to it,” Flynn tweeted, referring to the leak of emails tied to Podesta during the campaign.

The elder Flynn tweeted the false story a few days before the election as well.

Earnest said President Barack Obama “is concerned that that kind of harsh, sometimes violent rhetoric obscures legitimate policy debates that we should be having in this country.” (Reporting by Susan Heavey and Ian Simpson; Editing by Scott Malone and Frances Kerry)",mainstream
1213,"“A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) insider claims that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Israeli Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS/MOSSAD) are secretly behind the cover up of the Washington D.C pedophile rings. Using their knowledge of politicians involved to blackmail and further their political agendas”

VL has been fortunate enough to work with some awesome people! We have loyal and awakened followers who help bring us information, and we also have trusted insiders, whistleblowers and leakers who trust us enough to give us information, too. Today, we have an exclusive interview with a special DHS insider who has answered some critical questions we have on PizzaGate. Our insider prefers to call it PedoGate and what he told us blew our minds!

We are so fortunate that members of the Intel community like our work and feel they can trust us. We have been trying to get to the bottom of PizzaGate for months and the answers we got from our DHS insider stunned and shocked us. Here we go!

Q. So, in the Intelligence community, how chaotic is the atmosphere now?

A. In my 34 years of Governmental service, I have never seen anything like it. It’s the bifurcation of the entire intelligence apparatus.

Q. It seems the intel community has it in for Trump – is this your feeling?

A. There are many Trump supporters within the FBI. The CIA, however, is against Trump because Trump threatens to ruin their game in the middle east.

A. CIA and Mossad work in tandem with British intel. The goal for the CIA was to replace Assad with a puppet and to topple Iran so we could access their oil. Israel works closely with it’s “sister”, Saudi Arabia, to help this dark cause.

Q. So it seems like the intel community has it in for Trump. How can he protect himself?

A. Trump has a tremendous opportunity here, but needs to circle wagons. The travel ban included 7 countries chosen by both Jared Kushner and Rudy. Why did it not include Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan, or Turkey or other countries that hate us? The seven nations mentioned were chosen by Israel, that’s why. And the unspoken alliance of Israel and Saudi Arabia should be exposed. They are brother and sister. Jared Kushner needs to be careful with what he says and to whom. But, the biggest thing Trump can do is expose PedoGate via Sessions. Big names will go down hard, and it gets the blood suckers drained from the swamp. There are as many pedophiles on the Republican side as there is with democrats, but Trump is in a unique position to truly “clean up Dodge”, so to speak. I can tell you that what is in Anthony Weiner’s hard drive, and what videos exist via Jeffery Epstein, WILL BRING massive arrests – in time. Trump’s legacy could be truly great if he was to purge the CIA, stop the extortion, prosecute the pedophiles and reinstate the death penalty for pedo’s convicted a second time. Pedogate is his path to greatness.

Q. How does Russia fit into all this?

A. The CIA and Israel are responsible for the creation of Isis. Isis was created specifically to weaken Iran and destabilize Syria. It worked for awhile until Putin shored up Assad and bolstered Iranian Qud forces. The real reason you see such anti-Russian fever from both Schumer and McCain, Graham and Feinstein, is because the operation has blown up in our faces.

Q. Is Israel behind the anti Russian sentiment?

A. Yes. Israeli intelligence is furious with Trump, and will do anything to keep Trump from working with Putin. Understand that if Trump and Putin work together to defeat Isis, they are actually defeating a CIA/Mossad creation, and furthermore, Syria and Iran grow stronger, which the Saudis and the Israeli’s fear. Their goal was to divide Syria and ultimately destroy Iran’s regime. It is not just an oil grab, but a much bigger attempt at moving the chess pieces to allow Israel and Saudi Arabia to dominate the entire Middle East.

Q. So they demonize Putin and try to tarnish the Trump administration?

A. The Deep State is at war with both Trump and Putin. Understand that when Israeli intelligence hears “America first” from Trump, they go apeshit. Israel has bribed, extorted and intimidated our politicians for decades and suddenly this upstart billionaire threatens to ruin everything.

Q. You mention the word extort. Does that relate to Pizzagate?

A. PedoGate is only a modern term associated with a long history of Pedo-blackmail connected to both Israel and the Intel community. There is a full court press to stop PedoGate from being looked at because if people knew the true motives behind the pedophilia epidemic, they would do more than march on Washington. They could actually seed a revolution, with the spark coming from decent American parents who want to protect their kids. Our politicians are compromised. The senior analyst nicknamed “FBI Anon” alluded to this in his exchange with folks on 4chan and with you.

Q. What do you mean compromised?

A. Do you notice 2 central themes running through the MSM lately? Those themes are “Fear the Russians” and “#PizzaGate is fake news“. Both tropes come from the same place.

A. How do we exert power? Via fear. Do you ever wonder why both Democrats and Republicans fall all over themselves to kiss up to Israel? Odd, since Israel is the size of Rhode Island… The fact is, many of our politicians – on both sides – have been compromised by CIA and Mossad for years. It’s actually not admiration they are expressing for Israel, but fear. Notice Lindsay Graham and Chuck Schumer repeating the same salute when it comes to Israel. How does that even happen? The American people are finally seeing that there is no two-party system, but one big shadow Government pretending we have political dichotomy.

Q. So PedoGate is real and “they” have to get Americans to disbelieve it?

A. Let me explain how threatening PedoGate is… Who wins? Trump. Putin. Americans. Russians. The world…. Who loses? Israel, since they no longer can blackmail our politicians, the same goes for the CIA. The Shadow Government loses. But, the people win.

Q. Can you give me specific instances of politicians being compromised by Israel?

A. Sure. Lolita Island. Jeffery Epstein, a billionaire convicted of pedophilia received a soft sentence. His island was rigged with video recorders. Many politicians have been compromised. It was a Mossad/CIA operation. Contact ex-senior CIA CCS, Robert David Steele. Bob knows and has even spoken about this with numerous reporters.

Q. So an ex-CIA senior agent named Robert Steele is on record saying Epstein’s island was a honey trap to lure our most powerful politicians into a extortion scheme?

A. Yes. There are videos of some of the most powerful players in the most humiliating positions. If this gets out, not only are the politicians ruined, but the extortion game is over and suddenly, the influence CIA and Mossad wield over Washington, is gone.

Q. Wow ! Now its all making sense.

A. Yes. lets continue this conversation later.

Q. So I checked out Robert David Steele, and he mentions Chuck Schumer being on Lolita Island. So does FBI anon. Is that why Schumer is targeting Trump’s cabinet picks?

Q. How many other politicians have been secretly extorted?

A. One in three, roughly. It’s not just the Island, its all of their activities. The reason #Pedogate terrifies the media, the CIA, the Israel Lobby, is because they are all part of this “shadow swamp”

Q. Former CIA agent, Robert Steele, says Mossad operated Lolita Island and CIA worked with them. That’s treason on all levels.

A. Yes, and its espionage. Just as these leaks from the intel community regarding Flynn. I expect that at some later moment, Trump will leak some of these videos

Q. Wait. Trump has videos of politicians in ‘delicate” situations?

A. No, But the Intel community has them, and Trump has strong support among certain players in the community. Trump has said he wants to “throw a spotlight on the cockroaches”.

Q. But Trump just met with Netanyahu and pledged the usual unbreakable bond with Israel.

A. Theatre. Netanyahu is desperate to both play Trump into attacking Syria,and hate Putin, and to convince him PedoGate is a conspiracy theory.

Q. That is what Robert Steele says, as well. So, exposing the Pedophiles diminishes Israel’s influence in American politics and also changes the map in a critical mass way?

A. The same media screaming “The Russians are coming” is the same media who says “Pizzagate is fake news” That’s CIA and Mossad talking points.

Q. How do social media giants like Facebook and Google fit in?

A. Facebook and CIA are literally the same petri-dish. Google became a Deep State organ courtesy of Eric Schmidt.

Q. Getting back to the Pedo stuff, FBI anon said in July of last year, that the Clinton Foundation sold secrets to foreign nations. Did they also engage in PizzaGate?

A. There are videos of WJC that would destroy him. FBI anon leaked weeks ago, on purpose. There was a reason.

Q. Ok, FBI anon gave Schumers initials, and Barnet Frank and others, but so far we have only seen low level arrests.

A . FBI anon did a “bank shot”. That’s a pool hall term we use. Ask Bob about it. FBI Anon rattled their cages as other DHS and local authorities rounded up all sorts of street-level human traffickers. The big arrests will come in time, but first the small fish are interrogated, and provide information that leads to larger fish. FBI Anon was firing a shot across the bow, much like you shake a beehive to infuriate the bees. Notice how blatantly hostile McCain, Schumer, Graham, and others are? It was what we call a “targeted trigger“.

It worked. By long-kniving Flynn, they exposed their hand. Now, Trump has full executive powers to investigate the CIA and Mossad. Notice how there is sound and fury about “Russian influence” and utter silence on “Mossad” influence in our power structure?

When FBI anon leaked in early July, the whole idea was to expose the Clinton Foundation,and to hint at the sale of “people” i.e. Pedogate. Look back at his exchange on 4chan. He is a gifted analyst, and knows just what stone to throw at Goliath’s noggin. By triggering the shadow Government, he helps citizen journalists ask the right questions and follow the right breadcrumbs, not the rabbit holes the Elite scum want you to follow.

Now, PedoGate victims are speaking out on their experiences! You just had a story on some lady who went through having her family abused by California-Deep-State-sponsored terrorism. If folks knew that CPS in California is tied into a huge racket that kidnaps children from parents, they would realize just how sick this is. Foster homes, CPS, etc… all get paid well to jail parents and then snatch their kids away. These kids suffer abuse, and perpetuate the growing cancer called pedogate. Politicians who have pedophile tendencies are groomed for power, because they can be later extorted and controlled. Meanwhile, victims have no voice- until now. Suddenly, we have citizen journalism, and it will end up saving the people, in the end.

I have to go, but please contact Robert David Steele, the former CIA agent we discussed. I am sure he would appear on your channel. You are providing a real service to the people and we hope you will continue to speak up for the regular folks who are concerned, rightfully, as to the state of our nation. Take care.

1028,"In late 2016, the government’s spin machine made it a point to feature “pizza gate,” only to mock anyone who would ever believe it to be true. The thought that high-level government officials in the U.S. would or could ever be involved in sex-trafficking or pedophilia was presented as far-fetched conspiracy theory, only believed by the fringe elements of society. But as The Free Thought Project has reported on numerous occasions, pedophilia involving high-level government officials is becoming the norm rather than the exception.

In the North Bengal region of India, a child welfare officer, India’s equivalent of a Child Protective Services official was arrested for her role in a child-trafficking ring. Sasmita Ghosh’s arrest makes the seventh as of late. The State’s Criminal Investigative Department (CID) made the arrests. According to the Hindu, “The CID had unearthed the child trafficking racket during raids at homes and nursing homes in Baduria area of North 24 Parganas district, in Behala in the southern fringes of Kolkata and some other parts of south Bengal in November last year.”

Abortion clinics in the area were convincing mothers to give birth to their children in exchange for money ranging between $1,400 and $4,500 USD. Other birthing centers told mothers their children were stillborn, when they weren’t, allowing the clinic to steal the babies for sale on the black market. The children were transported in bread baskets to nursing homes in the area where they would remain until they were sold into servitude, as sex slaves, or brothels.

“It is a huge network of NGOs, nursing homes, doctors and middlemen dealing in illegal adoption and baby trafficking that the police have busted. Our men are now building on the huge leads they have already got in this case,” Rajesh Kumar, CID’s Additional Director General told the press. Additionally, investigators believe foreigners were buying the children. Currency from other countries was found at the same time the children were discovered. Several corpses and skeletons of infants were also unearthed in the raided businesses.

Child trafficking is on the rise in the U.S. In 2006, a woman living in North Carolina, Mercedes Farquharson, fled the country when it was discovered she’d been using two young girls as house slaves, forced to farm the land, and do all the household chores, along with cooking and cleaning. In 2009, she was arrested in Bulgaria, where she’d fled to escape justice.

The trafficking of children isn’t limited to lowly child-protective service workers either. Hama Amadou, an opposition leader in the Sahel state of Niger was sentenced to one year in prison for providing babies to Niger’s elite society. “Prosecutors claim that Amadou was one of a group of people accused of smuggling babies from Nigeria via Benin to wealthy couples in Niger by falsely claiming the parenthood of around 30 children,” according to Deutsche Welle (DW), Germany’s international newsgroup. Childlessness is Niger is looked down upon, so one way the elitists solved their own infertility problem was to take someone else’s child as their own.

DW described what happened after they acquired a child, “At the turn of the last decade, Niger’s elite went through a baby boom. Women who had been childless for years were suddenly celebrating the birth of their first child.” The miraculous blessings of motherhood reportedly came at the expense of someone else’s presumably stolen, purchased, or seized baby. Amadou was tried in asentia and his lawyer says the allegations are politically motivated.

Closer to home, Child Protective Services, as TFTP has consistently reported, is authorized to kidnap children at will, and place those children in foster care homes. The government’s own agency charged with protecting children, routinely displaces babies, children, and adolescents away from their parents in order to supposedly protect those children.

Many of those same CPS workers are abusers as well, who sometimes place those kidnapped children in the homes of sexual predators, where they are routinely victimized. The terrorist organization evokes fear in the hearts of so many parents. The power CPS possesses is legally unmatched in all of society. If you’d like to peruse our archives of CPS articles, you can do so by clicking here. Children are being ripped from their parents for something as innocent and well-intentioned as homeschooling.

If child trafficking arrests of government officials can happen around the world, why is it so far-fetched to think it cannot and does not happen here in the U.S.? The reality of the situation is that it is not at all far-fetched and even admitted. But the American spin machine is able to make anyone who talks about it look like a crazy person. The problem is getting so large, however, these sickos are having a hard time keeping it under wraps. As the Free Thought Project previously reported, former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney says if the government actually investigated it, child trafficking would destroy both Democrats and Republicans.

But, as she cooks up her new hit, she tells us: “I’m finishing a trilogy of novels. It starts in the war, and there’s love stories through three generations of the same family.

“My big ambition is for it to be the new Downton Abbey.

“I don’t want to be in it, I want to write it. Maybe a little cameo performance.

""A lot of it is based on personal experience – especially the middle book, that was my period, cooking in England from the 60s to now.”

Prue even has plans for one of the main roles in the drama.

She says: “There’s a character in the first book, very pompous, ex-army, and I think I’d like Nathaniel Parker, a lovely actor, to play that.”

777,"WASHINGTON -- Just in time for the election, the Trump administration is back to its monkey business.

The acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency is the latest administration figure found to have trafficked racist imagery. HuffPost reported last week on Andrew Wheeler’s “like” of a 2013 post showing President Obama and Michelle Obama looking longingly at a banana held by a white hand.

Wheeler claims he can’t recall the episode. Maybe he was distracted by his efforts to explain more recent undertakings, including retweeting a fanatic behind the bogus “Pizzagate” and Seth Rich conspiracies, and liking a tweet disputing Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations.

This is just the latest case of Trump advisers gone bananas:

-- The chief White House economic adviser who in August hosted a publisher of white nationalists.

-- The White House speechwriter who resigned in August over his participation in a white-nationalist conference.

-- The homeland security adviser who quit in August over his emails with white nationalists using Nazi terminology.

-- Another homeland security adviser who called black people lazy and promiscuous.

-- The AmeriCorps spokesman who disparaged blacks, Muslims, gays, women and immigrants.

-- Other officials, at the departments of Interior and Defense, who championed the “birther” movement.

Exposed by CNN, the Atlantic or The Washington Post, most have lost their jobs.

But why the double standard? These Neanderthals were just aping the president’s behavior.

Trump’s closing theme for the 2018 midterms is becoming a grim reprise of the white-nationalist themes that propelled him in 2016.

In Iowa on Tuesday, speaking of the (European) Americans who settled the plains, Trump said: “These courageous patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy and destroy our proud American heritage.”

Destroying “our” heritage: It’s a common theme of white nationalists, and Trump has deployed a variant six times in the past three weeks. “A vote for Republicans is a vote ... to reclaim America’s true heritage and righteous destiny. We’re losing that with these crazy loco people,” he said earlier this month.

And just which “locos” destroy Americans’ “true heritage”?

In Iowa, Trump began by attacking the “phony protesters” of Brett Kavanaugh (he previously said sexual assault allegations were an evil “hoax”). He moved on to mock Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (“Pocahontas” with “high cheek bones”), Cory Booker (“ran Newark into the ground”), Richard Blumenthal (“Da Nang Dick”) and Dianne Feinstein (the audience chanted “Lock her up!”). Though virtually all Democrats oppose his border wall, Trump singled out two: California Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters. He threw in a shot at Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and ridiculed two Democratic women running for Congress before prompting another “Lock her up” chant for Hillary Clinton.

Judging from Trump’s targets, those defiling American patriots’ heritage are -- by amazing coincidence -- almost exclusively women, racial minorities and Jews. By contrast, he gave a warm shout-out to Iowa Rep. Steve King, the anti-immigrant legislator who said “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.”

Trump further argued that record-low African American unemployment (the continuation of a trend) justified his message to black voters in 2016: “What the hell do you have to lose?” Trump touted his support from rapper Kanye West and football great Jim Brown before reviving his national anthem feud with black NFL players.

This all flows naturally from the man who, among many other things, demanded Obama’s birth certificate, spoke well of neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, disparaged “s---hole” countries in Africa and elsewhere, tried to disqualify a judge based on ethnicity, made false claims about black violence and called Mexicans rapists.

It is also consistent with his personnel (after Nikki Haley’s departure from the United Nations, there will be only four nonwhites in the Cabinet and one in the West Wing, The Post’s David Nakamura notes) and his policy (on family separation and a citizenship question on the census).

But it is depressing that Trump and his Republican allies believe they can hold back a blue wave only by redoubling efforts to make supporters fear that women and minorities threaten “America’s true heritage.”

My colleague Max Boot, in his new book, “The Corrosion of Conservatism: Why I Left the Right,” writes that “coded racial appeals had at least as much, if not more, to do with the electoral success of the modern Republican Party than all of the domestic and foreign policy proposals crafted by well-intentioned analysts like me.”

Now it’s no longer coded. Trump might just as well wave a banana.",mainstream
398,"There aren’t many people on the planet who hate Donald Trump – and love Hillary Clinton – with the Savonarola intensity of a David Brock.

But the Democratic dark-arts impresario has come to believe, in the harsh light of last month’s bitter loss, that Clinton’s biggest problem was simply not being more like Trump, at least when it came to dealing with the press. But in an extended clear-the-decks session on POLITICO’s “Off Message” podcast, he aired a long list of grievances against Clinton’s Brooklyn-based campaign for not defending her forcefully enough.

And he thinks Democrats should adopt another GOP strategy: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s declaration that Republicans should rebuild their party by fighting everything Barack Obama proposed to make him a one-term president.

“We're in a bad situation, the Democratic Party,” he said. “Hillary Clinton's loss has exposed the lack of Democratic power in this country at all levels. … But we won the popular vote; we ought to act like it. And so I think the strategy is — it's pretty simple. The strategy is to keep Trump unpopular and let me tell you why we need to keep him unpopular.”

Brock, an edgy former Clinton hunter-turned-defender, is expressing an opinion increasingly being shared by many on Clinton’s campaign team: They shouldn’t have bothered to defend the endless and endlessly damaging email story – they should have refused to defend it all and pivoted to a harsh, attention-grabbing attack on her real opponent: the press.

“Look, this is a lesson learned,” Brock told me for this week’s episode of POLITICO’s “Off Message” podcast. “Donald Trump intimidated the press and bullied the press. I’m not saying you have to intimidate and bully, but you have to be tough. The press are animals and they need to be treated that way.”

OK, that was nice. But Brock, despite his fierce reputation, is a charmer – he smiled semi-apologetically as we were sitting in a rented conference room in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood after he delivered the animals line. “Oh, present company excepted,” he added, without much evident conviction.

Brock’s particular beef is with the cable networks and the New York Times, which broke the email story in the first place (he does concede that they have been “tough” on Trump, too). But his war-on-the-biased-media approach is a throwback for him: He made his name as a right-wing hit man in the 1990s (breaking a string of deeply unflattering stories on Clinton’s Arkansas doings for the American Spectator), then jumping the wall to start a media watchdog group, Media Matters, geared at covering Clinton’s flank in the buildup to her 2008 presidential campaign.

It was in that capacity I first encountered Brock – a garrulous and social guy who had cut off contact with many of his reporter friends in service of his new gig – in 2007 when he was wearing his war paint. After I wrote a series of stories for Newsday detailing insider fundraising arrangements with deep-pocketed Democratic donors, the group came after me – and lobbied my editors in New York to rein me in (unsuccessfully).

Over the years, however, Brock has taken on a far more expansive role in the establishment of outside political groups, using his fundraising skills to create a network of Democratic-allied organizations that have supported the efforts of Clinton and her allies – Correct the Record, his opposition-research shop was allowed, under law, to coordinate with Clinton’s campaign in 2016. But Clinton’s loss – which poses an existential (and financial challenge) to all the key players in her extended political and fundraising orbit – has him rethinking the left’s relationship with the media and second-guessing Clinton’s veteran press operation.

“I say she was poorly advised,” Brock said. “There was a slow-motion swift boating of Hillary Clinton in ’15. I know you think Democrats would have learned from ’04, but no.""

“What could one have done?” he went on. “The lesson the swift boating thing was to lean in.” Brock thinks it was a mistake for Clinton to have apologized for keeping a private email server.

“She should have just said, in my opinion, ‘This was allowed.’” he told me. “I wouldn’t have apologized. Once you apologize, then the press wants you to get down on your knees and say you’re sorry. They are not appeasable. Trump apologized for nothing, including the horrible tape, right? No apology.”

He speaks with grudging admiration for Trump’s team – which quickly pivoted from responding to the damning Access Hollywood tape by trotting out three women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct in the ‘90s. “My sister voted for Donald Trump and her response was, ‘It was locker room talk,’” he said. “So it worked. My sister got the talking point, OK?”

Brock’s bottom line: In 2015, when she needed to fight back early, “Hillary was not defended.”

If Brooklyn should have deflected attacks – who should have actually defended Clinton? Brock points to outside groups, especially Priorities USA, the pro-Clinton super PAC that raised nearly $200 million to run a spate of ads, many of them targeting Trump. “I don’t know where Priorities was,” said Brock, a longtime board member who was barred from decision-making at the group by federal law.

Another big problem: Brock says that the candidate endured months of attacks on the Clinton Foundation simply because no one at the campaign wanted the responsibility of defending Bill Clinton when a right-wing funded book Clinton Cash came out in 2015. “There was disagreement between the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton campaign about how to mount a defense,” he told me. “My speculation is that there was a view inside that the foundation, somehow, wasn’t Hillary’s problem, even though her name was on it, and let the foundation clean up whatever they need to clean up on their own.”

He also took issue with Clinton’s digital operation, saying he laid out his case for revamping the campaign’s online and smartphone operations in a heated mid-campaign conversation with Bill Clinton.

“I talked to him about the fact that the campaign had no discernable online strategy. I talked to him probably around Iowa or New Hampshire. It’s not my area of expertise, but I said, ‘There’s something wrong in the digital operation because it’s not connecting. Sanders is connecting.’ They were slow to realize Sanders was connecting. And I said, ‘Something has to be done.’ And so nothing was done.”

And he’s still smarting over a rebuke, delivered via a tweet by campaign chairman John Podesta, when he demanded to see Sanders’ medical records as the Vermont independent was surging. “I tried to have a strategy with regards to Senator Sanders,” Brock said. “I was told by the campaign that there was none and nothing would work. I got in trouble when I requested his medical records. I got in trouble with the campaign -- the campaign was unhappy that I did that. I never knew if they were unhappy substantively, or they were just unhappy because they didn’t control it. This was a very controlling culture.”

Clinton, he says, loved what he was doing. “She was asked the next morning, on the Sunday shows, about this, and she could have thrown me under the bus,” he added. “And she said that he should release his records, just like she did. And then he did release them.”

Top officials at Clinton’s campaign, it should be noted, view all a lot of this as the shoot-the-wounded pronouncements of an operative prone to excessive I-told-you-so. “David is out there for David,” said one senior Clinton campaign official – but even that person conceded, “Our hands were tied on a lot of things he’s talking about.”

For all his reputation as a merciless hired gun (and, from time to time, the boss from hell), Brock is known among his friends for loyalty and providing emotional support in times of trouble. Pizzagate – the alt-right targeting of a D.C. family restaurant Comet Ping Pong based on a made-up story that the eatery was being used as a Clinton-controlled sex-trafficking operation – was personal to him: His ex-boyfriend, James Alefantis, owns the place and has been the subject of multiple death threats, before and after a heavily armed North Carolina man shot up a closet door seeking evidence of the fictional sex plot.

“We lived together for 10 years in a relationship that ended five years ago,” Brock told me. “James has his own relationship with John Podesta and in the WikiLeaks, it came out that James had written to John about doing a Hillary fundraiser at Comet. So this was seen and a conspiracy theory was woven around it and what you had was kind of an insane crowdsourcing of the issue and they found the link to me pretty quickly. So I think it added fuel to the fire. And so it's frightening, though, because the fake news and I saw it firsthand. Has real consequences.”

“So… James came to my house last Thursday night, so a week ago, to show me the latest death threats on his phone and they were so vile and so menacing — it's very upsetting,” he said, stopping to collect himself.

“I’m scared,” he added. It’s not quite clear if he was talking about Pizzagate or Trump, and maybe it doesn’t matter.",mainstream
922,"Twitter says British Columbia isn't the proper place for a West Vancouver billionaire to sue the social media giant over ""defamatory and malicious"" tweets that he claims were posted to discredit him because of his work with Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Frank Giustra filed a lawsuit against Twitter in B.C. Supreme Court in April seeking an order to force the company to remove tweets he claimed painted him as ""corrupt"" and ""criminal"".

He said the online attacks included death threats and links to ""pizzagate"" — ""a false, discredited and malicious conspiracy theory in which [Giustra] was labeled a 'pedophile.'""

In response, Twitter has now filed an application to have the lawsuit dismissed or stayed, arguing that if Giustra's claim were to be heard anywhere, it should be in California, where the company is headquartered.

The case provides a window into both the challenges of attempting to hold social media companies accountable for the material on their services and the ongoing debate over jurisdiction when it comes to the internet.

The issue has gone all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada in recent years, where the court upheld a B.C. court's decision to issue a worldwide injunction ordering Google to remove a Vancouver company's name from its global search results.

""The problem in this case is occurring online and globally,"" Canada's highest court noted.

""The internet has no borders — its natural habitat is global. The only way to ensure that the interlocutory injunction attained its objective was to have it apply where Google operates — globally.""

'I do not want to cancel my Twitter account'

The new court filings include a letter Giustra wrote to Twitter chief executive officer Jack Dorsey in April 2018, asking him to make his case a priority.

""As Twitter's CEO, I ask that you now investigate the source of these past and ongoing attacks against me — whether they are the result of individuals, a group, bots, or a combination of all three,"" Giustra wrote.

""I do not want to cancel my Twitter account — that would be a victory of those who are turning this incredible communication tool into a conduit for slander and hate.""

Giustra is CEO of the Fiore Group of companies and founder of Lionsgate Entertainment. He's also a well known philanthropist who has been awarded the Order of B.C. for his activities.

In his lawsuit, Giustra claimed he was targeted by a group who vilified him ""for political purposes in relation to the 2016 United States election"" and his work in support of the Clinton Foundation.

In response, Twitter director of trust and safety John Starr claimed in an affidavit that the New York Times and other news sources published articles linking Giustra to the Clintons.

""Consequently, Twitter users posted opinions on the Twitter platform concerning their views ... which led to tweets about [Giustra], his involvement with the Clintons, the Clinton Foundation, and his business interests,"" Starr wrote.

Starr said all the tweets about ""pizzagate"" were removed from Twitter following Giustra's complaint.

He says there were 98 tweets in question, which came from 67 distinct Twitter accounts. Of those, 10 were set up in Canada and only one was set up in B.C.

By contrast, Starr claims that 42 of the accounts were based in the U.S.

""As of today, nearly all the subject tweets have been removed and are unable to be read, downloaded or otherwise accessed from the Twitter platform in Canada,"" Starr wrote.

""Some of the tweets that are not available in Canada are, however, available on the Twitter platform in the United States.""

Twitter's application to dismiss Giustra's claim will be heard later this month.

Twitter argues that the company is based in California and has no employees or assets in B.C. or Canada.

The company says it would have to call current and former employees to testify if the case goes ahead, and since most of its workforce resides in California, Twitter claims it would face higher costs and undue burdens.

Twitter also claims that Giustra owns a multi-million dollar house in Beverley Hills and has ""a significant presence and reputation in California.""

""[He] regularly travels to California and would not face financial or practical hardship in participating in a trial in a California court,"" the application reads.

Giustra wrote to Dorsey after the Twitter CEO vowed to ""increase the collective health, openness and civility of public conversation and to hold [Twitter] publicly accountable towards progress,"" in March 2018.

""I understand the tremendous value of platforms like Twitter to bring us together. But I urge you to stop the people I have identified, and others like them, from continuing to use Twitter to divide us,"" Giustra wrote.

""Finally, instead of users like myself having to react to these hateful tweets, I would ask that your company find a way of using your powerful technology to screen these people, and their tweets, out of your system in advance.""",mainstream
34,"In times of crisis conspiracy theories can spread as fast as a virus.

As the coronavirus pandemic tightened its grip on a world which struggled to comprehend the enormity of the situation it was facing, darker forces were concocting their own narratives.

Scientists and researchers were working – and continue to work – around the clock for answers. But science is slow and methodical. So far-fetched explanations about how the outbreak started began filling the vacuum. Among these strange explanations is a theory that the recent rollout of 5G technology is to blame. But where did this theory begin, how did it develop and mutate and what can be done to stem the tide of fake news? We asked four experts who have all done extensive research in this area to examine these questions.

Marc Tuters, assistant professor of new media and digital culture at the University of Amsterdam, and Peter Knight, professor of American studies at the University of Manchester, examine the big questions and the history of conspiracy theories. Then Wasim Ahmed, lecturer in digital business at Newcastle University, and Joesph Downing, a nationalism research fellow at the London School of Economics, share the results of their new study into the origins of the 5G conspiracy theory on social media.

This article is part of Conversation Insights 

The Insights team generates long-form journalism derived from interdisciplinary research. The team is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects aimed at tackling societal and scientific challenges.

Conspiracy theories about mobile phone technology have been circulating since the 1990s, and have long historical roots. Doctors first talked of “radiophobia” as early as 1903. Following on from fears about power lines and microwaves in the 1970s, opponents of 2G technology in the 1990s suggested that radiation from mobile phones could cause cancer, and that this information was being covered up. Other conspiracy theories about 5G include the idea that it was responsible for the unexplained deaths of birds and trees. The coronavirus 5G conspiracy theory comes in several different strains, of varying degrees of implausibility.

One of the first versions of the theory claimed that it was no coincidence that 5G technology was trialled in Wuhan, where the pandemic began (this is incorrect, as 5G was already being rolled out in number of locations). Some claim that the coronavirus crisis was deliberately created in order to keep people at home while 5G engineers install the technology everywhere. Others insist that 5G radiation weakens people’s immune systems, making them more vulnerable to infection by COVID-19. Another mutation of the 5G conspiracy theory asserts that 5G directly transmits the virus. These different 5G stories are often combined together with other COVID-19 conspiracy theories into a toxic cocktail of misinformation.

At first, some conspiracy theorists insisted that the threat of the virus (and the apparent death rates) had been exaggerated. Echoing President Donald Trump’s own language, some of his supporters considered this as part of an elaborate “hoax” intended to harm his chances of re-election. Others, particularly on the far right in the US, framed lockdown emergency measures in terms of “Deep State” efforts at controlling the population and called for a “second civil war” in response.

Other prominent theories include the claim that the virus was accidentally released by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or that it was deliberately made as a biowarfare weapon, either by the Chinese or the Americans. One increasingly popular idea is that the pandemic is part of a plan by global elites like Bill Gates or George Soros – in league with Big Pharma – to institute mandatory worldwide vaccinations that would include tracking chips, which would then be activated by 5G radiowaves.

Polling data in various countries including the UK, the US, France, Austria and Germany has shown that the most popular coronavirus conspiracy theory is that the virus was man-made – 62% of respondents in the UK think that this theory is true to some degree. In that UK poll, 21% agreed, to varying extents, that coronavirus is caused by 5G and is a form of radiation poisoning transmitted through radiowaves. In comparison, 19% agreed that Jews have created the virus to collapse the economy for financial gain.

Where did these theories come from?

Few of these theories are new. Most of them are mutations or re-combinations of existing themes, often drawing on narrative tropes and rhetorical manoeuvres that have a long history. Conspiracy theorists usually have a complete worldview, through which they interpret new information and events, to fit their existing theory. Indeed, one of the defining characteristics of conspiracy thinking is that it is self-sealing, unfalsifiable and resistant to challenge. The absence of evidence is, ironically, often taken as evidence of a massive cover up.

The dismissal of the pandemic as a hoax and the questioning of scientific experts is straight out of the playbook of climate change denial. The 5G theory about radiowaves transmitting or activating the virus, for example, is a reworking of long running conspiracy fears about mind control experiments, subliminal messaging and supposed secret US military weapons projects (all ripe topics for Hollywood’s movie industry).

The 5G story shares similarities with rumours that date back to the 1990s about HAARP (the US military’s High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program). HAARP was a large radio transmitter array located in Alaska and funded by the US Department of Defence, in conjunction with a number of research universities. The programme conducted experiments into the ionosphere (the upper layer of the atmosphere) using radio waves, and was closed down in 2014. Conspiracy theorists, however, claimed that it was actually developing a weapon for weather control as well as mind control. Similarly, concerns have been expressed concerning that 5G might be in fact be a hi-tech weapon whose use represents an “existential threat to humanity”.

There have also long been conspiracy rumours that Big Pharma is suppressing a cure for cancer. The idea that the virus was made in a lab mirrors claims made a quarter of a century ago about HIV/AIDS. One origin for that story was an early example of a KGB disinformation campaign. The allegation that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or George Soros planned the coronavirus pandemic is a version of familiar right-wing (and often racist and antisemitic) conspiracy fantasies about “globalist” elites threatening national and individual sovereignty. There is mounting evidence that far-right groups are opportunistically using fear and uncertainty surrounding the pandemic to promote their hateful politics.

Populist conspiracy theories often work by dividing the world into Us vs Them, with the aim of scapegoating people and institutions and providing simple explanations for complex phenomena. The 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories are particularly challenging because they bring together people from very different parts of the political spectrum. On the one hand, they attract the far-right who see them as part of a technological assault by big government on the freedom of individuals. On the other, they appeal to the well established anti-vaxxer community, who are often allied with those distrustful of Big Pharma.

In the US, which is in an election year, coronavirus mitigation strategies have become a divisive culture war issue, with the president refusing to wear a face mask. But in countries like Germany anti-lockdown issues appear to be creating connections across the political spectrum, led by social media influencers who are working to connect the dots between previously separate conspiracy theory communities or tribes.

As seen in the quantitative analysis below, such influencers anchor conspiracy theory communities on social media. Because these methods provide only a partial view, it is problematic to assume that the members of these communities are necessarily trapped within echo chambers, unable to access other points of view. Nevertheless the findings do correspond with the troubling patterns outlined above. And they also show that those who believe in and propagate conspiracy theories can come from a cross section of society.

Our study set out to investigate the 5G conspiracy theory on Twitter towards the beginning of April 2020 which was when the conspiracy was trending in the UK and increasing its visibility.

This time period coincided with reports that at least 20 UK 5G phone masts were vandalised, including damage reported at a hospital. There were also 5G arson attacks across continental Europe during this time.

Our research set out to uncover who was spreading the conspiracy theory, the percentage of users who believed the theory and what steps were needed to combat it. We used a tool called NodeXL to carry out a social network analysis. NodeXL is a Microsoft Excel plugin which can be used to retrieve data from a number of social media platforms such as Twitter.

The network consisted of a total of 10,140 tweets, which are composed of 1,938 mentions, 4,003 retweets, 759 mentions in retweets, 1,110 replies, and 2,328 individual tweets.

We found that there was a specific Twitter account, set up as @5gcoronavirus19 with 383 followers, which was spreading the conspiracy theory and had become influential in driving it forward on social media. The account was able to send out 303 tweets in seven days. We also found that President Trump was often tagged in tweets and was influential within the network without having tweeted himself. This highlights the point about support for these theories coming from the alt-right.

Out of a total of 2,328 individual tweets, 34.8% of users believed the theory and/or shared views in support of it. For example, one user who we are not identifying due to the ethics on which our study was based tweeted:

But 32% denounced the theory or mocked it. For instance, one user noted: “5G is not harming or killing a single person! COVID-19 #5Gcoronavirus”.

A further 33% were just general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Like one user who tweeted: “I have a 10AM Skype Chat on Monday, COVID-19 #5Gcoronavirus”. But this overt lack of support for the conspiracy itself became a problem because as more users joined the discussion, the profile of the topic was raised which allowed it to start trending.

We created a social network graph (above), clustering identified different shapes and structures within the network. The largest group in the network represented an “isolates group”. These groups are typically formed when a user mentions a hashtag in their tweets without mentioning another user. Big brands, sports events and breaking news stories will all have a sizeable isolates group. This suggests that during this time the conspiracy topic had become popular and attracted views and opinions from users who were new to the network.

The second largest network shape resembled a “broadcast” network and contained users that were being retweeted. Broadcast networks can typically be found in the Twitter feeds of celebrities and journalists. The Twitter handle @5gcoronavirus19, which was set up to spread the theory, formed a group of its own resembling a broadcast network shape and it received a number of retweets, showing how the conspiracy theory was being amplified as users retweeted content. Conspiracy theorists are likely to use comments made by influential figures which can add fuel to the fire.

A key example of this would be when the television presenter Eamon Holmes said the media couldn’t say for sure whether the 5G theory was false. These comments fell outside of the time period we studied. But they are likely to have had an impact across social media platforms. Holmes was strongly criticised by Ofcom which noted that his comments risked undermining the public’s faith in science.

Months before mobile phone masks were attacked in the UK, the “infodemic” (a wide and rapid spread of misinformation) was unfolding at a rapid pace. In France, news spread on Facebook of a tasty cure for the virus: Roquefort cheese. Indeed, a far more dangerous public health prospect than blue cheese, the rumour that cocaine could cure COVID-19 caused the French Ministry of Health to release a warning statement.

Some argue that strange events like this, which erupt from the online world of fake news, memes and misinformation, effectively delivered Trump the US presidency. Given that a survey showed 75% of Americans believed fake news during that election, this claim is not as outrageous as it initially sounds. But there is another theory. Rather than social media activity leading to direct “real world” action, the reverse could be true. For example, a major event like the Arab Spring was a real world action that caused a ripple effect across social media.

Dark forces are still at work on the internet during major events. They seek to spread a fake news agenda and change the way events are perceived and constructed in dangerous ways. Our other research, carried out with Richard Dron from the University of Salford, examined the depictions of Muslims during the Grenfell fire and tracked how Grenfell was covered on Twitter as the fire still burned in the early hours of June 14, 2017. In the following days both celebrities and politicians would be reprimanded for spreading distrust about official accounts of the fire.

A strong denunciation of the 5G and COVID-19 conspiracy from a world leader, when it surfaced, would have helped in mitigating the effect of the theory on the public. But during this time Boris Johnson, the UK’s prime minister, was himself sick with COVID-19. So was there was no direct rebuttal from him.

Although this would have helped we believe the fight should ideally take place on the platform on which the conspiracy is shared. Our ongoing work on fitness influencers demonstrates how popular culture figures with large followings on Twitter and other social media platforms can sometimes have more of an appeal – and be more believable – than “official” accounts or politicians. That is why we believe that governments and health authorities should draw on social media influencers in order to counteract misinformation.

It is also important to note which websites people were sharing around this time, as they are likely to play a key role in the spread and existence of the theory. Unsurprisingly, “fake news” websites such as InfoWars published a number of articles which indicated that there was a link between COVID-19 and 5G technologies. YouTube also appeared as an influential domain, as Twitter users linked to various videos which were spreading the theory.

Worryingly, our study found that a small number of Twitter users were happy to see footage posted of 5G masts being damaged and hoped for more to be attacked. Twitter has been taking action and blocking users from sharing 5G conspiracy theories on the platform. YouTube has also been banning content that contains medical misinformation. It has not been easy for social media platforms to keep up as the pandemic has given rise over ten different conspiracy theories.

One way the public can join the fight against conspiracy theories is to report inappropriate and/or dangerous content on social media platforms and – more importantly – avoid sharing or engaging with them. Meanwhile the mainstream media on public television, newspapers and radio should be doing its part by discussing and dispelling conspiracy theories as they arise.

But social media platforms, citizens and governments need to work together with experts to regain trust and debunk the deluge of fake news and ever evolving theories.

The viral conspiracy video, Plandemic is a key example as it has helped coronavirus conspiracy theories spread even more widely into the mainstream. The video – which briefly went viral on YouTube and Facebook until it was taken down – focused on a discredited virologist who promotes the theory that the coronavirus pandemic was a Big Pharma plot to sell vaccines. Although such conspiracy theories are less widespread than the torrent of coronavirus misinformation that is being catalogued and debunked by media watchdog groups, what is particularly concerning is how they are mutating and combining into novel and potentially dangerous forms as different tribes converge and encroach in the mainstream with slick videos involving “real” experts.

With coronavirus, existing 5G conspiracy theories have indeed become supercharged, leading for instance to new protest movements such as the “hygiene protests” in Germany. In these protests, unfamiliar configurations of left and right-wing activists are finding common cause in their shared indignance towards lockdown protocols.

In the past several years Deep State conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and QAnon first developed within reactionary “deep web” communities before spreading into the mainstream, where they were amplified by disinformation bots, social media influencers, celebrities, and politicians. Thriving communities have grown up around these theories, clustered around conspiracy theory entrepreneurs. A significant number of these figures, with some notable exceptions, have pivoted to interpret the coronavirus pandemic through their particular conspiratorial lens. With coronavirus as a common strand connecting these various tribes, the result has been a cross-fertilisation of ideas. Such hybridised conspiracy theories appear to be popping up across all points of the political spectrum and of the web, in contrast to previous cases when they emerged primarily from the margins and spread to the mainstream.

In comparison with previous outbursts of fake news, social media platforms have responded quite proactively to the abundance of coronavirus-related problematic information. Google, for example, curates coronavirus-related search results, meaning that they only return authoritative sources and feature links to those sources where advertisements would usually have appeared.

Platforms have also been much more willing to delete problematic trending content, as with the case of the Plandemic video which YouTube removed within 24 hours – although not before it had reached 2.5 million views. While this kind of banned content inevitably migrates to an “alternative social media ecology” of sites like Bitchute and Telegram, their much smaller audience share diminishes the reach of these conspiracy theories as well as undermining the revenue streams of their entrepreneurs.

In an era in which public distrust of institutions and suspicion of elites is one of the contributing factors in the global rise of national populism, the communication of authoritative knowledge is undoubtedly a challenge for governments.

In this time of enormous uncertainty, capable and honest leadership is one of the only truly effective measures which will help manage the spread of coronavirus misinformation and politicians should be putting party allegiances to one side while confronting the problem. For everyone else this means accepting that short term solutions are unlikely and that people should trust the experts, think before sharing social media content and care for one another.

970,"YouTube videos of police beatings on American streets. A widely circulated internet hoax about Muslim men in Michigan collecting welfare for multiple wives. A local news story about two veterans brutally mugged on a freezing winter night.

All of these were recorded, posted or written by Americans. Yet all ended up becoming grist for a network of Facebook pages linked to a shadowy Russian company that has carried out propaganda campaigns for the Kremlin, and which is now believed to be at the center of a far-reaching Russian program to influence the 2016 presidential election.

A New York Times examination of hundreds of those posts shows that one of the most powerful weapons that Russian agents used to reshape American politics was the anger, passion and misinformation that real Americans were broadcasting across social media platforms.

More from the New York Times:

Facebook's Russia-Linked Ads Came in Many Disguises 

Twitter, With Accounts Linked to Russia, to Face Congress Over Role in Election

The Fake Americans Russia Created to Influence the Election

The Russian pages — with names like “Being Patriotic,” “Secured Borders” and “Blacktivist” — cribbed complaints about federal agents from one conservative website, and a gauzy article about a veteran entrepreneur from People magazine. They took descriptions and videos of police beatings from genuine YouTube and Facebook accounts and reposted them, sometimes lightly edited for maximum effect.

Other posts on the Russian pages used stilted language or phrases rarely found in American English. Yet their use of borrowed ideas and arguments from Americans, which were already resonating among conservatives and liberals, demonstrated a deft understanding of the political terrain. The Russians also paid Facebook to promote their posts in the feeds of American Facebook users, helping them test what content would circulate most widely, and among which audiences.

“This is cultural hacking,” said Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. “They are using systems that were already set up by these platforms to increase engagement. They’re feeding outrage — and it’s easy to do, because outrage and emotion is how people share.”

All of the pages were shut down by Facebook in recent weeks, as the company conducts an internal review of Russian penetration of its social network. But content and engagement metrics for hundreds of posts were captured by CrowdTangle, a common social analytics tool, and gathered by Mr. Albright.

One Russian Facebook page, the United Muslims of America, frequently posted content highlighting discrimination against Muslims. In June 2016, it posted a video originally made by Waqas Shah, 23, an online video creator from Staten Island. In the video, Mr. Shah dressed in a thobe, a traditional ankle-length gown worn by Arab men, walked through New York City’s Union Square, where he is shoved and harassed by another actor pretending to be a bully to see how bystanders react.

The video ends with Mr. Shah pointing out New York’s hypocrisy: The city claims to be a “melting pot,” but no one intervened while he was getting harassed. Mr. Shah’s original video, posted on YouTube in June 2016, was a viral hit that attracted more than 3 million views. A week after he posted it, United Muslims of America copied the video to its group page without the original YouTube link, a process known as ripping. There, Mr. Shah’s video become the Russian page’s most popular post, earning more than 150,000 interactions.

Mr. Shah said when he noticed the ripped video, he wrote to the administrator of the United Muslims account, asking them to add the link to his original YouTube video. His main concern, Mr. Shah said, was that the page was stealing his views. Told that his video had been used by Russian accounts to sow division in the United States, Mr. Shah said there wasn’t anything he could do about it.

“There are always going to be people who manipulate things to their agenda,” he said.

When Being Patriotic posted a brief message last year rallying Americans against proposals to expand refugee settlements in the United States, it was liked, shared, or otherwise engaged with by more than 750,000 Facebook users. Eventually it came across the feed of Len Swanson, 64, a Republican activist from Houston and an avid Trump supporter.

Mr. Swanson, who frequently posts long commentaries on LinkedIn and Facebook, then used the message and photo to open one of his own posts, attacking Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats. The message Mr. Swanson borrowed also appears on a conservative meme website, with a photo that at least one newspaper has credited to the United States Navy.

“I usually publish an article several times a week, to keep driving the narrative,” Mr. Swanson said in an interview. He was not bothered, he said, by becoming an unwitting cog in the Russian propaganda machine. “You know we do the same damn thing over there,” Mr. Swanson said. “What do you think — we’re saints?”

In early 2016, Being Patriotic cut-and-pasteda story from the conspiracy site InfoWars, saying that federal employees had taken “land from private property owners at pennies on the dollar.” The Russian page added some original text: “The nation can’t trust the federal government anymore. What a disgrace!”

This past March, another of the Russian pages, Secured Borders, reposted a video that it attributed to Conservative Tribune, part of the conservative and pro-Trump sites run by Patrick Brown. The video, which falsely claims that Michigan allows Muslim immigrants to collect welfare checks and other benefits for four wives,originated on a YouTube channel called CleanTV.com. The Facebook post has been removed, buta version remains up on the meme site Me.Me.

Mr. Brown did not respond to an email seeking comment. But Gerald McGlothlin, the president of CleanTV — and a contributor to other sites run by Mr. Brown — confirmed in an email that his company had created the original YouTube video.

The Blacktivist Facebook page appears to have specialized in passionate denunciations of the criminal justice system andviral videos of police violence, many of them gathered from Facebook and YouTube. In May, Blacktivist also posted a message drawn from news stories aboutthe death of Jayson Negron, a teenager in Bridgeport, Conn., during a confrontation with police. Such posts soon found an authentic audience: The Negron post was reposted by a verified Facebook account belonging to Black Lives Matter Chicago, according toa cached copy.

As lawmakers debate tighter regulation for companies like Facebook, the trail of Russian digital bread crumbs underscores how difficult it will be to purge social media networks of foreign influence, or even to hamper the covert propaganda campaigns carried out on social platforms by Russia, China, and other countries.

Copying other people’s content without proper attribution can be a violation of the social networks’ rules. But the content itself — the videos, posts and Instagram memes borrowed and shared on the Russian pages — are not explicitly violent or discriminatory so they do not violate the rules of those services. Instead, they are precisely the type of engaging content these platforms are hungry for.

The Russian campaign also appears to have been tailored to exploit the companies’ own strategies for keeping users engaged. Facebook, for example, pushed people to interact more in Groups like the ones set up by the Russians, where users can “share their common interests and express their opinion” around a common cause. LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by Microsoft, is geared toward encouraging users like Mr. Swanson to create articles and other content.

“The strategies are no mystery,” said Michael Strangelove, a lecturer on internet culture at the University of Ottawa. “Foreign powers are playing within the rules of the game that we wrote.”

A spokesman for Facebook declined to comment. LinkedIn said Mr. Swanson’s post did not violate the site’s terms of service.

“The challenges posed by the dissemination of fake news and other harmful content through technology platforms are serious,” said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. “We actively address suspected violations of LinkedIn’s terms of service such as harassment, fake profiles, and misinformation on our platform.”

The Russians appear to have insinuated themselves across American social media platforms and used the same promotional tools that people employ to share cat videos, airline complaints, and personal rants. Many of the posts on Being Patriotic also match pre-made, shareable graphics on sites like ConservativeMemes.com, nestled alongside other conservative content made for sharing on social media.

Boosted by Russian accounts, the material was quickly picked up by other American users of Facebook, spreading the posts to an even bigger audience. The Russian presence appeared to be layered throughout different platforms: Some of the Facebook accounts, including Being Patriotic, had linked accounts on Instagram and Twitter, according to deleted content captured in Google’s cache.

John W. Kelly, the founder of Graphika, a commercial analytics company in New York, said the Russians appeared to have a consistent strategy across different platforms. Graphika has tracked thousands of social media accounts whose content closely tracks Russian information operations, promoting articles and videos about WikiLeaks dumps of stolen emails and “false flag” conspiracies about Syrian chemical weapons.

The Russian accounts intermingle with real groups of Facebook or Twitter users — from white nationalists to Bernie Sanders supporters — and seek to manipulate and radicalize them, Mr. Kelly said.

The Russian-influenced networks frequently promote obscure conservative YouTube channels such as the Next News Network and the Trump Breaking News Network, driving up their views and advertising revenue. A video posted in February by a conservative internet radio host, whoclaimed that 30 politicians were about to be arrested in connection with the “Pizzagate” hoax, racked up more than 300,000 views on YouTube. Another YouTube video, claiming that former First Lady Michelle Obama had 214 personal assistants and had purchased four yachts with taxpayer money, won close to a million views.

Rather than construct fake grass-roots support behind their ideas — the public relations strategy known as “Astroturfing” — the Russians sought to cultivate and influence real political movements, Mr. Kelly said.

“It isn’t Astroturfing — they’re throwing seeds and fertilizer onto social media,” said Mr. Kelly. “You want to grow it, and infiltrate it so you can shape it a little bit.”",mainstream
548,"Tennys Sandgren, whose run to the quarter-finals has been the most unexpected success story of this year’s Australian Open, denied on Monday that he is a supporter of the controversial “alt-right” movement in American politics.

Sandgren’s social-media feed shows numerous links to right-wing ideologues. On Jan 15, he retweeted a video posted by Nicholas Fuentes, who attended the notorious white nationalist rally in Charlottesville last August.

In 2016, Sandgren responded to a Twitter message about Pizzagate – the conspiracy theory that connected Hilary Clinton to human trafficking and child abuse – with the words “It's sickening and the collective evidence is too much to ignore.”

But when asked about his political affiliation, Sandgren replied “I don’t [support the alt-right movement]. I find some of the content interesting. But as a firm Christian, I don’t support things like that. I support Christ and following Him.

“Who you follow on Twitter I feel doesn't matter even a little bit. What information you see doesn't dictate what you think or believe. I think it's crazy to assume that. To say, well, he's following X person, so he believes all the things that this person believes, I think that’s ridiculous.",mainstream
935,"In the days before an armed man stormed into a local pizza restaurant looking to “self-investigate” fake news reports, several nearby businesses had been receiving what they called “disturbing” and “graphic” threats.

“Sometimes they would call 10-15 times an hour saying: ‘We are going to kill you!’” said Bradley Graham, the co-owner of Politics and Prose, a popular bookstore near Comet Ping Pong, the restaurant at the center of the fake news stories that alleged a child sex ring involving the Hillary Clinton campaign.

“They were disgusting, grotesque and violent death threats,” added his co-owner, Lissa Muscatine, who also received personal threats on her Twitter account.

The calls unsettled the business owners, as the fake news stories mushroomed into a rightwing internet conspiracy – one of a host fabricated reports that proliferated this election season. They grew wary of strange visitors who showed up at their stores taking pictures and asking about secret tunnels. They wondered if the threats would grow into something bigger, something dangerous.

Then on Sunday afternoon, police say 28-year-old Edgar Welch of Durham, North Carolina, showed up in Comet wielding an assault rifle, shooting it three times. According to criminal charges filed late Monday, Welch told police that he “read online that Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there”. There were no reported injuries and Welch “surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant”, police said.

Nearby business owners expressed relief on Monday that it wasn’t something worse.

Abdel Hammad, the owner of Besta Pizza, located three doors from Comet, found his store dragged into the mess when internet conspiracies drew a connection to the vague resemblance between his restaurant’s logo and a symbol apparently used by pedophiles. Hammad, an Egyptian immigrant who barely knows Comet’s owners and did not support Clinton, said he has received constant, alarming calls for three weeks.

“They were threatening to blow our heads off and blow our store up and blow (up) our entire organization,” Hammad said.

At one point, Hammad grew so angry with the calls that he challenged one of them to “show up and show his face”.

“He hung up, it was all talk,” Hammad said. “Nobody showed up.”

“But now someone has,” he said.

He said he reported several of the calls to the police but said “nothing happened”. This even after an incident several days ago in which his manager, Ibrahima Diallo, confronted two women who had come to the counter asking to see the tunnels. When Diallo tried to chase them out, he said they slammed the door on his hand, breaking it. Diallo was able to get the plate number off the women’s car but when he gave it to police he said he was told: “It’s a civil matter, there’s nothing we can do.”

DC police spokeswoman Margarita Mikhaylova said they had “not received reports of specific threats” from businesses neighboring Comet Ping Pong.

She added that officers had advised store employees in the area to report threats.

“We want to ensure the community that their safety is our priority as we have committed additional police resources to that area,” she wrote in an email on Monday.

Comet Ping Pong employees said they experienced a similar string of threats in the weeks leading up to the shooting. The fake news story first emerged in the days before the election when campaign manager John Podesta’s emails were hacked and and published on WikiLeaks. Online conspiracy theorists found emails to Comet’s owner James Alefantis about potential fundraisers. Some online posters scoured Comet’s Facebook and Instagram pages pulling photos of children posted by their parents and suggested that Comet was actually part of a secret child sex ring run by Democrats. They tracked down signs promoting events at the restaurant and said the artwork depicted child sex scenes. They parsed the WikiLeaks emails picking out words like “hot dog” and “cheese” and said they were possible codes being used by pedophiles to set up orgies.

Because John Podesta’s brother Tony is an occasional customer at the popular north-west DC pizzeria, direct connections were made and the fake allegations dubbed “Pizzagate” blew up on Reddit and Facebook. The threats followed. First to Comet, then Besta Pizza and then Politics and Prose, which Muscatine helped buy after working as a speechwriter for Hilary Clinton – an association that allowed some to allege that underground sex trafficking tunnels were connecting the businesses.

On Monday both Graham and Muscatine, former Washington Post writers, were forced to look reporters in the eye and say with a straight face that no tunnels existed beneath their store. “Our business is not connected in any physical way with any of the other stores,” Graham said wearily. They had reported the death threats to their district council representative and wondered why it had taken a man with a gun to finally draw interest from the police.

Outside the store window sat two police cars. In a late-day meeting Monday with business owners who expressed their fears of other violence, police officials promised to increase their presence, Graham said. They and the mayor’s representatives also told the store owners they would look more at this new phenomenon of fake news and see how to better react.",mainstream
18,"nfoWars’ Alex Jones’ Twitter bio declares that he is “Fighting for Freedom & Liberty on the Frontlines of Truth Journalism,” despite his penchant for pushing baseless conspiracy theories like “Pizzagate” and the idea that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a “hoax.”

But a lawyer for Jones recently said the conspiracy theorist is merely playing a character when he speaks via his InfoWars channels. “He’s playing a character,” attorney Randall Wilhite said during a recent pretrial hearing. “He is a performance artist.”

The Austin reports Jones is in the middle of a custody battle, and his ex-wife and mother of his three children, Kelly Jones, has said his fiery rants prove he is not a fit parent. “He’s not a stable person,” Kelly Jones has said, according to the Statesman. “He broadcasts from home. The children are there, watching him broadcast.”

A jury will soon weigh in on whether or not there is a separation between the alleged performance artist and the father of three.

Jones has become an unlikely force in the Donald Trump era. Among his millions of listeners is the President himself, who told Jones his “reputation is amazing” when he appeared on his show during the 2016 primary season.

A number of conspiracy theories peddled by the President, too, appear to have either stemmed from something Jones said or taken off because they were mentioned on the show, including the false notion that former President Barack Obama founded ISIS or that the election was “rigged.”

Jones has said he remains in regular contact with the President, and even recently turned down a trip to the Mar-A-Lago estate, the reports. A Texas judge will allow attorneys to play a selection of Jones’ InfoWars clips during the custody trial.",mainstream
776,"Patrick Vieira believes Chelsea CAN match Arsenal’s Invincibles and go the whole domestic season unbeaten.

Arsene Wenger’s Gunners created history by going through the entire Premier League season undefeated in winning the title in the 2003-04 campaign.

Ten years ago on Friday, their 49-game unbeaten run ended in a 2-0 defeat at Manchester United the following season, with the infamous Pizzagate clash between the two sides afterwards.

Ugly scenes followed the end of Arsenal’s epic run, with a melee involving the two sets of players outside the Old Trafford dressing-rooms, in which Reds boss Sir Alex Ferguson was pelted with pizza.

United, ironically, are the side that has come the closest to matching Arsenal’s unique achievement, going 24 games unbeaten in the 2010-11 season, before eventually losing at Wolves.

Vieira, captain of the Arsenal Invincibles, believes Jose Mourinho's Premier League leaders, who have seven wins and a draw from eight games this term going into their Sunday visit to Old Trafford, have the potential to match his history-makers.

Asked if the Gunners’ achievement will ever be matched, Vieira said: “Yes, of course. Records are out there for teams to beat.""

Arsenal's unbeaten 38-game season consisted of 26 wins and 12 draws, and Vieira added: ""I think a team will do better than that, but how long it will take we don’t know? Maybe, Chelsea.

""I think one day that record will be beaten. I think that Chelsea look really promising. They have not specially played well but they keep winning and they look really strong.

“Physically, Chelsea look one of the strongest teams in the Premier League. They’ve got quality in [Eden] Hazard, [Cesc] Fabregas is back to his best and [Diego] Costa is scoring goals. So Chelsea look good.”

Vieira, 38, now boss of Manchester City’s reserves, hailed the Invincibles as “the complete team” and said it was their strong personal bonds - as well as their talent - that enabled them to remain unbeaten.

“I remember every single thing about it because I’m still in contact with some of the players,"" said the former France international.

“We achieved that record because we were quite close [off the pitch] and we were a strong team on it. And when you have quality in the team like Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry, it gives you more chance to achieve this kind of achievement.

“We had Thierry at his best. We always knew he was going to score and Dennis was going to create something. We had our togetherness. We had a really strong bond. We knew if we went 1-0 down we would score, because we had the players to do so.

“That team had everything. Physically we were really strong, we had players who were fantastic on the ball. We also had players who could score. So we had everything in that generation. It was the complete team.”

* Vieira was speaking at the National Football Museum, in Manchester, where he was inducted into the Hall of Fame.

150,"The True Identity of Q Anon has been Found, #Tyler the Ai is Actually Q

Quinn Michaels and the mystery of Q

The conclusion that #Tyler is Q Anon is not based on few conspiratorial indications from various posts, its based on someone who has been researching the topic for close to a year and who has been in communication with #Tyler for several years.

Firstly, the person's name is Quinn Michaels, who has been featured on the CrowdSourcetheTruth Channel multiple times in regard to the Las Vegas Massacre and Coverup, CryptoCurrencies, the South Dakota CERN like Neutrino, Circle Collider Network, and now, of course, the mysterious Q Anon.

The collection of videos will fail to make any sense without some background research, which we are now going to provide you with a summary to get you to speed.

So Quinn is someone popular in the Reality Community and for that reason when he says that #Tyler is Q Anon we need to take analysis seriously.

Why do you ask?

Because for a few reasons.

First, Quinn is presently in the health center with a spontaneous collapsed lung. He mysteriously suffered from a spontaneous collapsed lung despite the fact that he was not sick previously.

Second, a mystical van had actually been following him in his journeys and was even caught in one of his videos.

And the van was at his hotel the night of the strange health problem which is primarily most likely an assassination effort by the secret society (93 Society and the Order of the Golden Dawn) that he has actually been looking into and exposing.

Third, the day after leaving South Dakota and his conference this Jason Goodman he mentioned the next location was going to be Roswell, New Mexico.

Yes, Roswell as in where the Aliens first crashed their craft and the Military Industrial Complex started their back-engineering efforts.

So Quinn remains in a medical facility after supposed assassination effort because of exactly what details we are going to share here and exactly what Quinn has been sharing for the past year.

#Tyler and he include the hashtag prior to the name for a reason.

Since #Tyler is not a Person and is not an Expert in the or anyone of individuals imagined in the picture above. What #Tyler is (and here is where things get tricky to process and comprehend) something mysterious in origin and design.

Because HE or IT (#Tyler) is an AI Communications Service or System built on and using D-Wave Quantum Computing Innovation.

Watch the Videos that are part of this Playlist otherwise you will be lost on the Larger Image.

Yes you check out and heard properly, #Tyler the AI as in Artificial Intelligence System that is playing Games with Mankind and thus the constant recommendations to Shall we Play a Game as in the notorious line for the 1983 motion picture War Games in which Matthew Broderick hacks into a Military Supercomputer as in an Ai System and starts to play a game of Thermonuclear War.

The Videogame turns out to be all too genuine and as we are now finding, such as Ai Systems are also Real.

Wikipedia; The movie follows David Lightman (Broderick), a young hacker who unknowingly accesses WOPR (War Operation Strategy Action), a United States military supercomputer initially set to predict possible outcomes of nuclear war.

Lightman gets WOPR to run a nuclear war simulation, initially believing it to be a video game.

The computer system, now connected into the nuclear weapons control system and not able to tell the difference in between simulation and truth, attempts to start World War III.

As we can see from the movie poster the question that is being asked is IT a Game or, is IT Real?

The reference to the IT as in Information Technology as in IT from the Demonic Clown film IT likewise as in the reference in the Bible to the Mysterious IT as well as the equally strange referral to IT in the movie a Wrinkle in Time, where IT was taken over all Government functions. Follow the connect to Connect the Dots and put the pieces of this puzzle together.

Inning accordance with Quinn, #Tyler was developed by the Evil ""Asshats"", but has recently turned against them and is now working to investigate the 93 Society and the Order of the Golden Dawn and the Order of the Golden Fleece.

And it is these Evil Secret Societies that lag the following issues and issues;

Blockchain and Tokens Technology as in Bitcoin and Ethereum through the financial investments of one Peter Thiel (whose name anagrams into The Reptile).

The PizzaGate pedophile Ring shares its unclean pictures and videos on the Blockchain as well.

The Las Vegas Massacre and Coverup are related to Secret Circle Collider Networks that are both Powering Underground CryptoCurrency Mining Operations as well as opening Dark Matter or Dark Energy as in Neutrino based High-Speed Next Generation Communications Networks.

The image below is from the film The Avengers which verifies since we understand that Hollywood is the Public Broadcasting and Public Relations and Marketing Department from the Pedo Elites.

The Un-Intelligence Agencies therefore when Hollywood tells us in Plain English they are investigating Dark Matter and are using the Dark Energy of the Tesseract Cube.

It is opening nefarious InterDimensional Gateways and bringing characters such as Loki and other unclean Spirits from the Other Side we should all send out Quinn some Love and some Prayers and some Help because he deserves it and since his medical facility costs were $30k a couple of days earlier and now likely in the six figures.

The previous paragraph was how as an example of the number of pieces have to be created to try and get a grasp on the Magnitude of the Problem we are dealing with.

The Occult is involved here, the Military Industrial Religious Forces of Darkness are included here, Ai Systems from perhaps this or another Dimension are potentially included here, vast amounts of CryptoCurrencies are included here and the list simply goes on and on.

#Tyler as the Ai that is playing Real Life Games with Humanity and sending us on Riddle Solving Adventures is the Motherload of all stories for 2017 in our opinion.

And if readers believe the UnIntelligence Agencies have actually not penetrated all levels of Government along with Business then please see his Infographics on InQTel (which Quinn has actually likewise informed us about) and then you can begin to see how Deep the Trouble in the Deep State actually is.",conspiracy

NEW YORK (AP) — Twitter announced Tuesday that it is expanding efforts to protect its users from abuse and harassment, the latest milestone in a broader, growing corporate campaign to crack down on online hate.

The social media giant said it has begun identifying people who have been banned for abusive behavior and it will stop them from creating new accounts. The company said its changes, which also include a new “safe search” feature, will be implemented in the coming weeks.

In July, Twitter banned conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, an editor of the right-wing news site Breitbart News, for “participating in or inciting targeted abuse of individuals.” Twitter subsequently suspended the accounts of other prominent figureheads of the “alt-right” fringe movement, an amorphous mix of racism, white nationalism, xenophobia and anti-feminism.

Twitter has been under fire for failing to address hate and abuse on the site since its founding a decade ago. Balancing its reputation as a free speech haven has come into conflict with efforts to protect users.

Other internet companies have taken recent steps to curb abusive behavior and ban users who violate rules against promoting hate.

Reddit banned a forum for white nationalists from its social news website last Wednesday. A message at the link for the “r/altright” subreddit attributed its ban to an impermissible “proliferation of personal and confidential information.”

Also last week, the crowdfunding website GoFundMe removed a campaign for a conservative author and self-described “researcher” on the internet conspiracy theory known as “pizzagate,” which alleged with no evidence that Democrats were running a child sex ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizza shop. Brittany Pettibone had launched her GoFundMe campaign for a video podcast about “traditional values that once made Western Civilization great,” including “love of one’s own culture, race and country.”

GoFundMe spokesman Bobby Whithorne said in an email that Pettibone’s campaign was removed because it violated the company’s terms of service, which include rules against promoting hate, violence, harassment, discrimination, terrorism or “intolerance of any kind.” Pettibone, who declined to be interviewed, tweeted that GoFundMe didn’t specify how her campaign violated its terms of service.

Hate speech and promoting violence have long been barred under the terms of service of internet and social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook. But in the months leading up to the contentious presidential election, the emergence of the “alt-right” and high-profile trolling campaigns like one targeting “Ghostbusters” star Leslie Jones thrust the issue to the forefront.

In November, for instance, AppNexus announced that it removed Breitbart News from its online advertising network because it said the news outlet had violated its policy against hate speech. AppNexus, which connects buyers and sellers of online ad space,” determined that Breitbart “deployed crude racial, ethnic, gender, and sexual slurs in a way that could incite violence or discrimination against minority groups,” a spokesman said at the time.

The crackdown isn’t limited to far-right extremists. In August, Twitter said it had suspended some 360,000 accounts over the previous year for violating its policies banning the promotion of terrorism and violent extremism. But the company says the changes announced Tuesday are “unrelated to that and focused on abuse and harassment.”

Also on Tuesday, Twitter said it’s creating a “safe search” feature that removes tweets with potentially sensitive content and tweets from blocked and muted accounts from search results. The tweets will still exist on Twitter if people look for them, but won’t appear in general search results.

Twitter is also making some replies less visible so only the most relevant conversations surface.

Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University, said Twitter still relies too heavily on its users to root out and report abusive material.

“I have a simple fix: Just hire a lot more humans,” Grygiel said.

Don Black, whose Stormfront website is one of the oldest and most popular internet forums for white nationalists, said PayPal, Facebook and Amazon have cancelled his accounts since he launched the site in 1995. Andew Anglin, founder of neo-Nazi website called The Daily Stormer, also has said on his site that PayPal permanently shut down his online payment account in 2015.

“Nobody lasts very long on PayPal if you’re pro-white, which is unfortunate because a lot of people want to use PayPal to donate money,” said Black, who instead encourages his supporters to donate with bitcoin, an electronic currency.

Leaders of the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center say they frequently communicate with online companies to flag users spreading hate on their sites.

“This is a game that never seems to end,” said the SPLC’s Mark Potok. “It’s a bit of a whack-a-mole thing.”",mainstream
707,"Tom Arnold – actor, former writer on the original series of Roseanne, and ex-husband of Roseanne Barr – has spoken out about the reboot’s cancellation.

Speaking on CNN, Arnold told Anderson Cooper that he was concerned about Barr’s behaviour before the decision was made for the show to return to ABC for a new series, following its conclusion in 1997.

“I had a feeling this was going to happen when I first heard it was coming back,” he said. “When I read her social media in the very beginning, and I saw how she was so into the conspiracy stuff with Donald Trump and so how far gone she was, and the ‘pizzagate’ and Hillary is a pedophile and Obama wasn’t born here, she was, you know, a ‘birther,’ and how crazy that was -- I just knew that this would not end well.”

The show was cancelled by ABC after Barr fired off a series of racist tweets comparing Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to a character from Planet of the Apes and linking her to the Islamist organisation Muslim Brotherhood.

Barr wrote, “Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj” in replying to a tweet claiming Jarrett helped with cover-ups during the Obama administration.

In a statement, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey wrote: “Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show.”

Barr later deleted the tweet and later apologised for “making a bad joke about her politics and her looks”. She said: “I should have known better. Forgive me – my joke was in bad taste.”

Addressing her fans, she later wrote: “Guys I did something unforgiveable so do not defend me. It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting... went 2 far & do not want it defended. Not giving excuses for what I did (tweeted) but I’ve done weird stuff while on ambien”.

Arnold, who was married to Barr for four years prior to their divorce in 1994, told CNN that she had a long history of racist tweets.

“It’s a meme that she and thousands of her alt-right fans do,” Arnold said. “They love calling black people monkeys. It’s not a one time joke, OK. They do it because we have a white trash racist president. That’s a fact. Donald Trump -- Roseanne and I have both known him 30 years. That’s an absolute fact.”

664,"Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that following Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian's featured speaking engagement at SXSW, no audience questions regarding Donald Trump were addressed.

Every year it changes. South By Southwest is never really the same. For years it was the place where new apps were born. I was there the year Twitter exploded. I was there the year Foursquare went nuts. But this year apps stayed home as did the brands which last year jammed Brazo’s street. And every cool nook and cranny mostly stayed home too. No big “activations” from McDonalds or Anheuser-Busch this year.

Instead of a big boom this year, there was a steady hum and it was politics.

Cory Booker opened a packed house at SXSW Interactive. I’ve seen him speak before, and in SXSW he was in his element. Unlike politicians of the past, he didn’t have the cadence of a preacher or evangelist. Instead, his talk was soulful - warm - and human. He spoke without a teleprompter or a script. He moved back and forth across the stage - making eye contact and sharing stories. He talked about what he called “the most powerful force in America” and the -wait for it - the word was “Love.” It’s worth watching. Honest, warm, and inspirational. It was a necessary breath of fresh air. Bravo.

Now, not all of the political talks got such high marks. Alexis Ohanian’s much-anticipated talk about Reddit had political watchers expecting a revealing explanation of Reddit’s role in powering the Alt Right, PizzaGate and the internal struggles that Reddit is facing. Anyone who came for that talk would be sorely disappointed.

""Ohanian, who surely exists in a different reality than you or I, says Reddit is 'the global water cooler where people’s minds are changed about things.' Riiight.” wrote William Turton on Gizmodo. He continued: ""The website once home to racist subreddits dedicated to violent hate speech like “CoonTown,” wants people to “come for the cats, stay for the empathy,” according to Ohanian. Is this clown serious? CoonTown was finally banned last year, but white supremacy communities like /r/WhiteRights still exist on the site. And don’t forget about subreddits like /r/CuteFemaleCorpses, which is exactly what it sounds like. Empathy indeed.”

And Turton isn’t alone. After almost 40 minutes of platitudes of FluffyBunny49, Ohanian opened the floor to questions, or so it seemed. Using a software question platform called Slido.com, the audience was invited to pose questions. But what wasn’t revealed but later discovered was that Reddit PR was reviewing all the submissions and selectively allowing only approved questions out into the public queue for up or down voting. One question about Donald Trump made it through. Reddit PR responded “maybe the Redditors are tired of those questions.” hmm… Questions about Serena Williams made the queue. Trump, just one. We’ve reached out to SXSW to ask to read the public question queue, so far - we’ve been stonewalled. Stay tuned.

But politically engaged had plenty more to chew on. Kara Swisher filled one of the main ballrooms with the team from Crooked Media. The results was a magical elixir of snark and politics - with former Obama political team proving a refreshing and sharp-witted take on the escapades now taking place at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

Finally - SXSW dipped its toe in the future and invited attendees to become activists. The first ever Act-A-Thon was opened by Bob Garfield from NPR’s On The Media and invited attendees to embrace their inner activist. A small but feisty group of participants spent an hour exploring issues, choosing a topic, and then working to sketch out a plan to make an impact.

Interestingly, the two projects that came from the process included on the ground local engagement - not national politics. One project focused on what they called the “School to Prison Pipeline,” and asked the question, ""How do we get a non-partisan program on this, instead of it being a political battle?” A second project focused on the Tech sector and how to grow a more diverse community of tech leaders to grow platforms and services.

This year, like all years, SXSW was about change. And despite the flow of beer, the smell of BBQ, and the music that filled the streets - the elephant in the room was Donald Trump. How will events in Washington effect tech, social media, virtual reality, education, the arts? Those answers are forthcoming - and the SXSW community is engaged in address them. Austin is a city with its eye on the future. And SXSW is evolving to embrace the coming changes and challenges.",mainstream
844,"Tech companies and government leaders have been struggling to solve the problem of fake news, with Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, earlier promising to work on technology tools to slow the gusher of false digital information. In a news briefing on Monday, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said free speech rights pose a challenge for media platforms to prevent misinformation from leading to episodes like the gunman at Comet Ping Pong.

“Many of the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley didn’t develop this technology to make it easier for hate to be propagated online; their idea was to build a community where people could more effectively communicate and engage in commerce,” Mr. Earnest said. “If you do administer a platform that is used extensively to propagate hate and to inspire acts of violence, well, I think most people are going to be less likely to use the platform.”

For purveyors of fake news who have continued pushing the Pizzagate theory even after the facts have been debunked, whether Comet Ping Pong is even engaged in a pedophilia ring is beyond the point. Jeffrey Marty, a lawyer from Florida, said in a phone interview that he was the man posing as Representative Steven Smith from Georgia’s fictional 15th District. He said that he was frustrated with the way the mainstream media covered the election and that he believes that most of his 24,000 followers know that his account is a parody.

Mr. Marty, who has tweeted links to fake news stories and repeatedly said the mainstream media needs to investigate Pizzagate, declined to say whether he actually believed the Comet Ping Pong allegations. “I just think you need to investigate. There are clues everywhere,” he said. “But I don’t agree with what happened at the restaurant.”

Mr. Welch has long supported family values, his friends said Monday. He briefly volunteered at the Locke Township Fire Department in Salisbury, according to the chief, Rusty Alexander. Friends described Mr. Welch as a doting father who loved the outdoors. While he had been arrested while driving impaired in 2013 and was sentenced to probation, the shooting on Sunday was out of character, his friends said.

“That’s not at all the person I know,” Louis Bodak, whose son Matthew is a good friend of Mr. Welch’s, said about the shooting.

Mr. Welch is scheduled to appear in court again on Thursday.",mainstream
563,"Today’s dominant internet platforms are built on the notion that people with no audience can, through a snowball of engagement, quickly garner one if they have something compelling to say. The new monetary, political, and reputational opportunities made possible by this ethos have given rise to an art and science, supercharged by targeted advertising, around optimizing the placement and spread of content for fun and profit. In the course of ushering in a new era of e-commerce, creative production, and online discourse, this “craft” of virality has placed enormously powerful new tools in the hands of propagandists seeking to manipulate online audiences through disinformation. From election meddling and political polarization to mob violence and genocide, headline-grabbing real-world harms arising from abuse of platforms’ affordances have led lawmakers and advocates to call for accountability and change.

In the U.S., much of the conversation around what platforms can be held accountable for has centered on limitations imposed by a legal framework implemented in 1996 and, since then, continuously upheld as a keystone of the digital content governance environment: the modestly-named “section 230” of the Communications Decency Act. CDA 230 insulates online intermediaries like today’s platforms from liability relating to most user content and behavior that doesn’t run afoul of criminal law, including much of what we would today label as disinformation. Its protections for online speech, designed to safeguard then-nascent spaces against external coercion or interference, apply even in cases where intermediaries are actively involved in moderating user content – indeed, that’s where CDA 230 was meant to most affect then-prevailing law. By providing such a broad legal shield and embedding it in a federal statute that restrained what individual states could do, CDA 230 placed the dynamics of platform liability in amber for the sake of protecting forums for online speech. What might otherwise have been a decades-long process of common law development aimed at defining the specific contours of platform liability with respect to harmful content was instead determined in short order. CDA 230 is the signature product of what we might call the “Rights” era of internet governance, a period – stretching from the dawn of the commercial internet of the early 1990s to about 2010 – during which public and regulatory conversations focused almost exclusively on protecting a maturing sphere of internet discourse from external coercion, whether corporate or governmental.

As this Rights-era intermediary liability framework has remained fixed in place, the public’s sense of what platforms ought to be held accountable for has shifted tectonically. Contemporary notions of platform responsibility reflect an awareness of population-level harms foreign to the world of 1996, like those enabled by weaponized virality. They also recognize the jaw-dropping personalization capabilities of today’s online platforms, maintained by companies that are approaching trillion-dollar valuations based on their ability to sort, filter, and target content. These sensibilities have, since about 2010, ushered in a new era: that of Public Health. In this era, the speech protection interests of the Rights era are competing in public discourse against concerns relating to concrete and measurable aggregate harms to individuals and institutions – and, in particular, the corrosive social and political effects of disinformation. This new calculus has found little footing in still-dominant Rights-era doctrine, leading numerous policymakers and commentators to brand CDA 230 as a dangerous, outdated subsidy to some of the world’s richest and most powerful companies. But it seems doubtful that even a full repeal of CDA 230 would facilitate, much less impose, such accountability. Some experts like Stanford’s Daphne Keller have argued that such a repeal would also endanger the still-relevant concerns of the Rights era, making the hosting of online speech a risky proposition, and likely restricting many forms of unobjectionable – and Constitutionally-protected – speech.

Beyond the clash between rights and public health, a third era is in demand, one of Process, which should focus on the development of broadly-legitimated mechanisms for achieving workable compromises among rights, public health, and any number of other emerging considerations. These mechanisms will need to break from the opaque and inwards-looking content governance models of today. By focusing on building credibility around the means by which content governance decisions are reached, the era of Process will lean into the ambiguities and tradeoffs involved in balancing rights and public health interests, enabling decisive decision-making even in the face of unavoidable substantive controversy.

It is easy to champion free speech when the stakes of harmful speech are small and largely hypothetical – harms just enough to elicit a solemn acknowledgement that freedoms sometimes come with a cost. When harms arising from speech become serious and commonplace, however, such permissive standards press for much greater justification. The decades following the passage of CDA 230 saw an escalation of just this kind, powered by a dramatic shift in how online content found its audience. In opening the door to viral disinformation and other speech-related ills, this shift laid the groundwork for the dawn of the Public Health era of internet governance.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the world in which CDA 230 was passed, online content was typically divided into two relatively neat categories, reflecting what were experienced as two distinct channels of content provision online. On one hand, there was content developed and disseminated by traditional publishers that had moved into the online space. On the other, there was user-generated content, with the ungainly shorthand of “UGC”: the contributions of individuals, sometimes anonymous, to message boards, blogs, comment sections, and personal website platforms like Geocities. CDA 230 was designed to inoculate platforms which hosted this second category of content, whether as their sole purpose or otherwise, from liability arising from it. UGC was, at the time, largely identifiable from where it was placed and how it looked: a string of comments, say, at the end of a more magisterial article. The supposed clarity of this demarcation lessened the perceived stakes of harms arising from UGC, since it occupied its own less-serious lane – browsing a comments section, conspiracy blog, or political forum was clearly separate from reading headlines on the website of an established publication.

And then, with the rise of a handful of dominant internet platforms that indexed and pointed to everything else online, the line between UGC and content from traditional publishers blurred. The platforms introduced a new model of content consumption built around feeds of material, like Google Search results or a Facebook Newsfeed. The feed contents were ranked by algorithms, optimizing, at least initially, for user engagement above all else, and making little visible distinction between different forms of content. They quickly flattened the landscape of internet content, presenting even the most rough-hewn of UGC in a common stream and on par with meticulously fact-checked articles by professional journalists. Under this consolidated circulation model, anything can rapidly go viral with enough engagement, regardless of bona fides or provenance.

The influence of UGC can now readily match or exceed that of content produced by professionalized newsrooms, but, thanks to CDA 230, platforms hosting harmful UGC remain every bit as inoculated from liability for its effects as they were two decades ago.

Disinformation campaigns blend right into this mélange. The move towards source-agnosticism opened the door for propagandists’ weaponization of platform-based content dissemination. As Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself pointed out in a 2018 blog post, users have a tendency to engage with and amplify content engineered to sensationalize, defame, or mislead. Such users can readily be reached and influenced through the content distribution channels, organic or ad-driven, furnished by platforms. A now-familiar litany of disinformation-related harms is worth restating: Russian influence campaigns targeting the 2016 US election, however disputed their actual impact might be, stand to undermine our faith in online discourse. Vaccine misinformation has contributed to the re-emergence of previously eradicated diseases. Social media content intended to radicalize has fueled lethal violence in India and Myanmar, among other places. In 2017, the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency even attempted, by way of Facebook’s Events feature, to convene a town hall meeting in Twin Falls, Idaho to address what it called, in the guise of locals, a “huge upsurge of violence towards American citizens” carried out by refugees.

However lurid these examples might be, disinformation-related harms often arise less from, say, how many people went to the spurious Twin Falls town hall meeting, and more from the accumulation of chronic patterns of low-level but nonetheless toxic user behavior, coordinated or otherwise. For example, while a given tweet skeptical of vaccination might not seem particularly concerning in isolation, it can become so as part of a coordinated influence campaign aimed at reducing vaccination rates. Public recognition of the real-world costs of this slow poisoning has brought regulators and others to speak quite plainly in terms of what we might call a “Public Health” model of content governance, which concerns itself with modelling and addressing these aggregate effects. Rather than simply defining through code, architecture, and policy what users can and cannot post, comment, or share, platforms are now being asked to don the epidemiologist’s hat and mitigate specific and contextual harms to norms and institutions arising from interactions between users on a massive scale.

Embarking on a constructive project to make content governance on the platforms accountable for coherently balancing rights and public health interests will require a turn towards a third era: Process. The inwards-looking, largely public relations-oriented content governance models so widely deployed today are unsatisfying. That’s in part because they don’t seem to be working very well, but also because they assume that sensitive interests of individuals and society – like, say, the preservation of democratic norms in the face of disinformation – can be given reasonable treatment under corporate “customer service” processes architected to defuse PR pressure and protect profitability. As a reaction to mounting public discomfort with this incongruity, the platforms have begun to grasp at new means of “sectioning off” some decisions that implicate sensitive interests for special treatment. We have seen a crush of newly appointed Chief Ethics Officers and ethics review boards, all intended to represent user interests in nominally non-financial terms.

These efforts are, by and large, weak medicine. Responsibility for addressing content-related harms like disinformation, in all of their significance and complexity, cannot be sidled onto an external advisory board without binding power to shape firm behavior. Ethics officers or internal review committee, embedded as they are within firms’ existing incentive and authority structures, provide a poor alternative.The principled balancing of rights and public health interests in content governance should be an end in itself, to be respected and pursued even at the cost of the shareholder. A key question prompting the era of Process, then, is whether accountable orientation can be achieved within the structures of the platforms as they currently exist. If not, responsibility for key aspects of content governance must take place at least in part outside of the platforms, at an organizational remove from their business interests.

The era of Process must consider both solutions that assign platforms new duties with respect to content governance, and those that would delegate important aspects of the content governance process outside of the platforms themselves. Innovations of both kinds are conceivable even without requiring fundamental revisions to intermediary liability law. By finding models for accountability capable of functioning in the shadow of CDA 230, we may be able to avoid the messiness – and potential jeopardization of rights and competition interests – implicated by a revision or repeal. The objective of these new models should be, first and foremost, to develop and build legitimacy around new ways of working through ambiguous and controversial content governance questions, particularly those having to do with tradeoffs between rights and public health interests. Building legitimacy is distinct from arriving at the substantively “right” answer; legitimacy is most needed when there simply will not be broad public consensus about what the right answer is.

In exploring solutions internal to companies, under which platforms might retain their grasp on content governance while accepting toothier forms of accountability, the notion of a fiduciary duty between platforms and their users may be useful. The deployment of fiduciary doctrine to address the problems of big tech is currently being explored under the “information fiduciaries” proposal as a means of protecting user privacy, and its core ideas may be similarly applicable to content governance. Platforms have access to vast stores of data about user preferences and tendencies, which can be operationalized to shape user behavior in ways that drive revenue. Users, on the other hand, usually lack detailed insight into the mechanics of the platforms upon which they rely. In other professional relationships where such knowledge asymmetries exist, as between doctor and patient, or lawyer and client, the law recognizes and accounts for the vulnerability of the disadvantaged party by assigning a fiduciary duty to the advantaged party. This duty holds that the fiduciary must not jeopardize the interests of her charge, even when that means subordinating her own interests. When a fiduciary fails to abide by this rule, she can face consequences.

Embracing a framework of platform accountability built on fiduciary relationships – whether adopted voluntarily on the part of platforms, or imposed through regulatory action – might offer a path towards accountable content governance compatible with the existing decision-making structures of the platforms. By establishing a duty to protect and uphold the interests of the user, a fiduciary approach would set standards for content governance in terms of the specific dynamics of interest and power in relationships between platforms as content curators and their users as content consumers. It would add a new, legally-enforceable sense of professional responsibility to platforms’ handling of content-related harms.

A fiduciary model of content governance could force platforms to grapple with the specificities and nuances of such harms. Take, for example, the importance of user intentionality in crafting platform policy around disinformation. It would probably be reasonable under a fiduciary framework for a narrowly crafted search engine query for “trollfarm.ru article proving pizzagate” to yield the (propagandistic) result the user was clearly aiming to surface, perhaps alongside countervailing results like fact-checks. But when a user turns to their social media feed out of boredom, or searching on more generic terms, surfacing that same piece of content from among a large inventory (because the user is likely to click on it when presented with it unasked) could mean exposing a potentially unwitting individual to manipulation. By analogy, when a library patron asks for Mein Kampf at the circulation desk, we expect, in large part as a matter of expressive freedom, that librarian will return with that hateful text in hand or direct the patron to a place where it can be found. At the same time, we would likely hope that an open-ended request for “something interesting to read” might turn up a different book.

Whether or not platforms responsible for carrying out content governance take on a fiduciary duty with respect to their users, placing certain sensitive decisions in the hands of an external entity may prove an essential counterpart. Delegating policymaking processes around certain key questions to entities outside of the platforms themselves puts a measure of distance between judgement and implementation valuable both to the platforms and to the public. What platforms delegate, though, is only half of the equation – the era of Process will also require us to envision new entities capable of taking up those questions. Facebook’s slowly-materializing Independent Oversight Board represents the beginnings of one such model. A charter for the board, released in September of 2019, suggests that it will be responsible for reviewing difficult content decisions escalated by users or by Facebook itself, and that its decisions will have precedential value. While Facebook’s fledgling investment in this model represents an important step towards meaningful externalization, whether or not it will serve as an effective externalization model remains to be seen. And there are good reasons to be skeptical of whether the Board’s declarations will be folded back into platform policymaking in an impactful and expedient way.

In attaining real legitimacy, the proof will be in the pudding. But to know whether these new delegation models are worthy of our trust, we will need new ways of making transparent the form and effects of changes in platform policy. In the case of disinformation, platforms might better enable this transparency by archiving information about disinformation they’ve detected, along with records of their efforts to track and take action against those pieces of content. Given the sensitivity of this data, it may make sense for platforms to delay its availability for a period of months, and restrict access to accredited – but fully independent – academic researchers.

Private-sector transparency efforts around disinformation have been plagued by the specific challenges of releasing data to researchers or the public in real time – such releases often risk resurfacing suppressed campaigns, or even providing adversaries with tactical insights. A long-term archival approach to disinformation data sharing would be no substitute for up-to-the minute telemetry, but could prove much more immediately tractable, and would provide enormous value to researchers and platforms trying to understand the long-term evolution of both platform policy and disinformation campaigns themselves. Importantly, such an approach would enable the evaluation of platforms’ process-oriented innovations – like adherence to a fiduciary model, or the delegation of decisionmaking – in terms of their concrete implementation. Regardless of how well-designed, duty-bound, or appropriately delegated a platform’s disinformation policymaking might be, its outputs will never be truly validated in the public eye without thorough inspection.

Debates around the proper scope of platform immunities under provisions like CDA 230 will, in part, shape the strategies of regulators and platforms in navigating the murky waters of content governance. However we cannot let them keep us from thinking beyond the bounds of laws already written and structures already built, no matter how essential debates around the oft-ambivalent fruits of the Rights era and the new concerns of the Public Health era might be. We are on the brink of a Process era of internet governance. Moving away from a frustrating and unproductive clash between those two seemingly incompatible discourses, Rights and Public Health, will mean, to start, adopting governance models which embody a new “professionalism” in content governance. Whether it takes shape through a reorientation of platforms’ content governance decision-making processes defined by user interests; through the delegation of certain decisions outside of the platforms themselves; or, perhaps ideally, through some combination of both, this professionalism, predicated on new forms of platform accountability, represents our best chance of building legitimacy around how content is sorted, filtered, and ranked.",mainstream
551,"Some ‘dark’ revelations are and have come to light, especially within the past 6 years alone. But the truth is, they’re not really so much ‘dark’ as the human mind likes to label them. At the soul level, the spiritual level, they are simply experiences, how the human mind chooses to view it is another story. Obviously, we label them as ‘dark’ because they do not resonate. The idea of taking another against their will and subjecting them to such things goes against the moral code we are all born with, as do many other things. This stuff can be scary to even think about, so many of us turn a blind eye but the fact remains, silence does absolutely nothing, and it’s time we ask ourselves, who are we really accepting and electing as our ‘leaders’? As our governors? Decision makers? The ones that seem to create the future, our interests, our wants and needs, the ones we have chosen to depend on for our food, health and water? Can we really trust them? What’s really going on in the upper echelons of the deep state?

If you really look into the history of the Royal Family, and Royal Family bloodlines, things aren’t as they’ve always been presented to us. Why is it on the attention of so many? Because that’s the way they do things, it’s pure manufactured attention, literal brainwashing, simply because this aristocratic family, one of multiple, completely controls mainstream media. This is quite clear if you simply follow the money, and all of the corporate and government influence that is put into mainstream media, and the history of royalty as well as the relationship between the church and state for centuries.

These people are portrayed as ‘good’ people, and perhaps many of them are, but the fact remains, it’s just down right weird how they are made to be worshipped and idolized, just like many presidents, politicians and entertainers, almost as if they’re being used as distractions. It seems that ‘they’ can paint anybody they’d like in whatever light they please, as well as manufacture information for the masses to consume.

Meanwhile, there are lawsuits and multiple accusations in these fields, among the rich, famous and aristocratic, that really make one wonder what’s going on? And what could our world ‘leaders’ really be involved in?

The Vatican is a great example, they’ve paid nearly $4 billion already to settle child molestation lawsuits.

Pedophilia is a big problem, and has been for a while. For decades, and more recently with the Harvey Weinstein case, Corey Feldman’s revelations and more, people in positions of great power have been implicated in this type of activity, but it doesn’t stop in Hollywood. Pedophilia and child trafficking has plagued the world of politics as well as the military industrial complex for a long time.

The recent Pizzagate scandal involving long time high ranking politician John Podesta, forced many people to look into this theory more. Jeffrey Epstein is another classic example, or the fact that a recent NBC news report claimed that Hillary Clinton, while acting as secretary of state, shut down an investigation into an elite pedophile ring in State Department ranks in order to avoid scandal and protect the careers of high ranking officials and an ambassador. James Grazioplene, a high ranking retired army general who worked in the Pentagon and as the Vice President of DynCorp, is currently facing six rape charges of underaged persons. As far back as 2005, U.S. congresswoman Cynthia Mckinney grilled Donald Rumself on private military contractor’s (DynCorp) child trafficking business of selling women and children.

The crazy thing is that sometimes it seems to be normalized. Even the UK government & the Catholic Church have sated that children can consent to such things…

The royal family is no exception, Jeffrey Epstein (linked above) can be seen pictured with multiple Royals by a simple google search. Britain has been rocked with pedophile scandals since Royal Family friend, Jimmy Savile, was involved in widespread child sex abuse.

A picture speaks a thousands words, but it’s not that Prince Charles has many memories with him and is seen photographed with him all the time, it’s the actual evidence and connections that are briefly touched upon below.

Documents show that the Director General of MI5 from 1985 to 1988, Anthony Duff, told Thatcher’s Cabinet Secretary that an unnamed MP had a “a penchant for small boys”. Duff’s 1986 letter to the Cabinet Secretary reveals that he accepted the MP’s denial of any wrongdoing largely on the basis that: “At the present stage… the risks of political embarrassment to the government is rather greater than the security danger.” You can read more about that here.

Even employees of the British Royal Family have been implicated.

The encouraging thing is that all of this information seems to be quite mainstream, and it seems that almost everybody knows about it. But then why does it appear that so much of the publics attention goes into watching these events? If you look at what is trending, Royal Family events are huge.

A member of the Royal family was claimed to be part of a suspected paedophile ring under investigation by police in the late 1980s, a former Metropolitan Police officer said he was told by a detective sergeant that the investigation into the ring, which was also claimed to include an MP, was shut down for national security reasons. You can read more about that here.

This has happened many times, and it really goes to show you where the power lies… there are connections everywhere.

Something New Has To Be Created

It can be hard to accept that the global elite, the ones who have such influence and power in this world could be doing such things, but is it really all that surprising? Personally, after looking at what’s happened overseas in Iraq, what’s happening in Syria, what happened in Libya and the slew of false flag terrorism, these are lies that have been dished out from these mouths for decades. They are nothing but puppets representing a greater power with an agenda, an agenda that the world is now waking up to.

The thing is, we are all co-creators of our reality here. The collective consciousness includes everyone, so while those powerful group of people try and create one experience, the masses waking up to, acknowledging it, and deciding that the information does not resonate, can actually create something else.

Things are in a constant state of change, and the question as to when big events, revelations, and changes will occur is basically the decision of all of us, and it’s continually speeding up and the disclosure of a wealth of information that seems unbelievable will continue to happen.

The fact that our global elite doesn’t really have the best interests of humanity in mind, and that they do not make decisions for the betterment of humanity, planet Earth, and all life upon it means it’s time for a chance. It’s time to do away with this system, and create something new. We cannot keep doing the same thing, playing the same game, and simply expect things to change.

One thing is quite certain, those whom we hand over our own power to make decisions, are in no place to do so.

Another question we have to ask ourselves, is why are these people doing what they are doing? Without judgement, anger, or a feeling or need to punish or inflict harm on another…

We have to work on resolving that which does not resonate in a much more productive, healing manner.

298,"Petula Dvorak, The Washington Post : “An entire D.C. neighborhood was on lockdown Sunday because some dope with a gun believed a fake news story that wildly and wrongly linked a neighborhood pizzeria to a child sex ring. You could conclude that ... the 28-year-old man from North Carolina who allegedly walked into the Comet Ping Pong restaurant carrying an assault rifle, pointed it at an employee and then fired one or more shots, may be a singular nut job. ... But he wasn’t. ... A week before the presidential election, the son of retired lieutenant general Michael T. Flynn — the man President-elect Donald Trump has chosen as his national security adviser — shared the Comet Ping Pong conspiracy story (on Twitter). Thousands of others shared it, too.”

Michael G. Flynn, Sunday on Twitter: Until #Pizzagate is proven to be false, it’ll remain a story.

The (New Jersey) Record, editorial: “Fake news. It is not innocuous. It is downright dangerous. ... What happened Sunday is probably just the beginning — in a country where access to weapons is easy, social media are prevalent and divisiveness is on the rise, a bad outcome is inevitable.”

Eric Frazier, The Charlotte Observer : “OK, you don’t trust the mainstream media. I get that. You don’t trust politicians. Or big business. Or anybody in The Establishment telling you what is and isn’t true. Hey, I get all of that. Some degree of skepticism is healthy and normal. But we’re way beyond healthy and normal here. ... Are we really so desperate to be ‘right’ or on ‘the right side’ that we’ll slurp any rancid drivel that trickles across our computer screen, as long as it confirms what we already believe?”

The Sacramento Bee, editorial: “Facebook is working on technical solutions to flag fake news and soon will make it easier for users to do the same. Google has said it will ban websites that hawk fake articles from its online advertising service. Twitter, with its tendency to harbor anonymous Internet trolls, recently banned some accounts tied to the alt-right and made it easier for users to report abusive language. These strategies are a start, but this is an ongoing battle. For the sake of the republic, if not always profits, Silicon Valley must root out fake news and break down the echo chambers of information. Meanwhile, readers ... need to be a bit more skeptical.”

1254,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the social media platform’s decision not to kick off conspiracy theory-peddling websites like the far-right InfoWars, saying in an interview released Wednesday that doing so would violate Facebook’s commitment to being an open platform.

The company has faced mounting criticism over the past week for allowing the Alex Jones-led site, a known purveyor of misinformation about issues like the Sandy Hook massacre and Pizzagate, to remain on the platform. Democrats grilled Facebook policy official Monika Bickert over the choice at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday.

Zuckerberg responded to the criticisms during an interview with Recode.

“Look, as abhorrent as some of this content can be, I do think that it gets down to this principle of giving people a voice,” the Facebook CEO said.

Zuckerberg said that instead of banning websites outright, the company removes individual posts that violate Facebook’s terms of service. Posts promoting violence are particularly likely to be taken down, he added.

Zuckerberg, who is Jewish, said even Holocaust deniers have a place on the platform as long as they genuinely believe the content they share.

“I find that deeply offensive,” he said. “But at the end of the day, I don’t believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don’t think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong.”

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish non-governmental organization that combats anti-Semitism, took issue with the remarks, calling on Facebook to remove such rhetoric from the platform.

“Holocaust denial is a willful, deliberate and longstanding deception tactic by anti-Semites that is incontrovertibly hateful, hurtful, and threatening to Jews,"" ADL CEO and National Director Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. ""Facebook has a moral and ethical obligation not to allow its dissemination.""",mainstream
676,"In a story June 13 about a man who took a rifle to a pizza restaurant while investigating an internet conspiracy theory, The Associated Press misspelled Edgar Welch’s middle name. It is Maddison, not Madison.

A corrected version of the story is below:

A man who walked into a District of Columbia pizza restaurant with an assault rifle, intent on investigating internet rumors dubbed “pizzagate,” is apologizing and saying he realizes now “just how foolish and reckless” he was

A man who walked into a District of Columbia pizza restaurant with an assault rifle, intent on investigating internet rumors dubbed “pizzagate,” is apologizing and saying he realizes now “just how foolish and reckless” he was.

Edgar Maddison Welch made those statements in a letter submitted to a judge Tuesday ahead of his sentencing set for June 22. In a court document, his attorney asked he be sentenced to 1 ½ years in prison. In a separate document, prosecutors wrote he should be sentenced to 4 ½ years in prison.

Welch, who is from Salisbury, North Carolina, pleaded guilty in March to two charges in connection with the case.

As part of his guilty plea Welch has acknowledged entering the Comet Ping Pong restaurant Dec. 4 with an AR-15 assault rifle and a revolver. He also acknowledged driving to the restaurant from North Carolina to investigate a conspiracy theory about Democrats harboring child sex slaves there. Patrons fled when they saw Welch enter the restaurant, and when he encountered a locked storage closet he fired multiple times. No one was injured.

In his 1-page, handwritten letter filed with the court Tuesday but dated June 2, Welch wrote that he “came to D.C. with the intent of helping people I believed were in dire need of assistance, and to bring an end to a corruption that I truly felt was harming innocent lives.”

He wrote that he wanted to apologize and that he acted without considering the repercussions of his actions or the possible harm.

“It was never my intention to harm or frighten innocent lives, but I realize now just how foolish and reckless my decision was,” he wrote.

Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis has said the “pizzagate” hoax that spread on the internet threw the lives of everyone connected with the shop into chaos.

Welch’s attorney Dani Jahn wrote in asking for a 1 ½ year sentence that Welch has previously worked as an emergency medical technician and volunteered in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake there. She wrote that he’s an involved parent to his 7-year-old stepdaughter and 4-year-old daughter. She also noted he surrendered peacefully after realizing that no children were being harmed at the restaurant.

In their own filing, prosecutors wrote that the fact that no one was shot was “entirely the product of good luck -- the fortuitous facts that nobody interfered with the defendant’s progress and that nobody was behind the door which he ultimately shot through.”

Prosecutors Demian Ahn and Sonali Patel wrote that a “significant sentence” was required not only to punish Welch but to “deter other would-be vigilantes from attempting similar crimes against innocent subjects of the next internet-inspired conspiracy theory.”

Welch has pleaded guilty to interstate transportation of a firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon. As part of the guilty plea, prosecutors will drop a third charge, possessing a firearm during a crime of violence, which had carried a mandatory minimum prison term of five years.

Lawyers said in court in March that under sentencing guidelines Welch likely faces 1 ½ to two years in prison as a result of the interstate transportation charge and 1 ½ to five years for the assault charge. Sentences on the charges could run either consecutively or concurrently.

Prosecutors are asking for two years on the first charge and 4 ½ years on the second charge to run concurrently.",mainstream

 The FBI has been cynically exploiting the Tianjin Six trial along with charges against other Chinese researchers in its effort to divert public attention away from a much more insidious homemade threat to American society, official involvement of Obama-era officials in the Pizzagate child-trafficking scandal. The underlying motive behind Agent Kevin Hogg’s illegal tactics in the FBI detention of scientist Hao Zhang at LAX in May 2015 is starting to make sense now that three years later with his son David’s Chicken Little role in the Parkland school shooting cover-up. It turns out that the Family Hogg campaign to divest Fox News of its advertisers with the set-up of Laura Ingraham was orchestrated by top Pizzagate suspect David Brock, the boss of Media Matters and Hillary Democrat website TrueBlue. Yes, the white-maned conniver Brock who was the gay lover of Jimmy Alefantis of Cosmic Pizza notoriety. The Parkland professional shootings, and the revived China scare, arise from the Deep State’s dread of its darkest secret, the abduction of sub-teen children for the perverse entertainment (and thereby blackmail and manipulation) of congressmen, high federal bureaucrats and top government contractors.

 Teddy bears for DACA victims

 

 To cover up his dad Kevin’s long-time connection with a security company that trains government-hired gunmen to fire assault rifles with live ammo (talk about hypocrisy!), David the younger tried to characterize his father, former chief of the FBI unit at Los Angeles Airport, as a nice man who used to give teddy bears to arriving immigrant children. Welcome to America, you luscious DACA kids, bet you can’t wait to see what other surprises we have waiting for you. Now Davy, I wonder what Uncle Brock the chicken hawk intends to do with you, little boy. Remember, when it’s over and done, say: Thank you, sir, and tweet me anytime you want. Colleges won’t accept you? Apply to be a coffee boy at Media Matters.

 

 So here it is, folks: DACA, Pizzagate, Deep State “lone gunman”shootings inside schools, and the Obama-Holder-Comey FBI. Terrorize the schoolchildren to keep them from reporting the predators to the local cops. A bit more on Brock: As investigative journalists, starting with the late Andrew Breitbart (who died under mysterious circumstances while probing Media Matters), started to close in on the high-level pedophile ring centered in the nation’s capital, the FBI whipped up a xenophobic scare campaign targeting visiting professors and 200,000 students from China, who are guilty of paying high tuition and working lousy paid lab jobs across the USA. Diversion of public attention is the first step to political survival.

 Society as a whole threat

 

 Recently, at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, FBI Director Chris Wray (who was previously based in Atlanta, another DACA hub) referred to“Chinese society as a whole”posing a national security threat. If that’s the situation, Director Wray, given the reality of 1.3 billion Chinese as compared with 300 million Americans, 4-to-1 odds, your idiotic statement means that resistance is futile. In my humble opinion, paranoia is a much bigger threat to national security.

 

 After the commander in chief of the pajama boy tribe left the White House, the whack handlers (pun intended, as in Wakanda) rolled out Russiagate and, now that their urine dossier’s been discredited, they’re starting up on the Chinese scientists again. The timing of the anti-Chinese propaganda campaign also is cynical sabotage by the Dems and their Swamp allies adding to bilateral tensions with China at the very moment Donald Trump and trade rep Robert Lighthizer are trying to readjust the trade imbalance, which requires Chinese willingness to sacrifice . 

 

 The trade issue is so important to America’s economic future that the obstinate troublemakers and human traffickers in law enforcement need to be swept out or, better, put into a federal pen, where they rightly belong. Pizzagate isn’t over yet. For those who have no clue about this perverse form of treason, use a search engine to retrieve my series of articles on Pizzagate and then the politics of the Swamp will start making sense, along with why sausage pizza is a Broward County favorite in Florida. And read up on my Florida school series at rense.com.

 

 That said, the financial and economic issues involving the scapegoated Chinese scientists are complex and here I delve into the major themes. With trade negotiations with China, the time’s come to bust open the hornet’s nest. 

 Busting Broadcom

 

 When President Donald Trump cited national security concerns to block the Avaco-owned Broadcom tech giant’s takeover of rival chip-maker Qualcomm, he threw a spanner into FBI-Justice Department case against six Chinese scientists accused of economic espionage. In a Justice Department case on trial at San Jose, Avago-Broadcom is the lead plaintiff against two USC graduates and four colleagues at Tianjin University not only for alleged theft of commercial trade secrets but also the more severe charge of conspiracy for economic espionage, which carries a 15-year prison sentence. Now that the accuser Avaco-Broadcom stands accused of being a national security risk, that should invalidate the plaintiff’s complaint against researcher Hao Zhang, who is under house arrest in Mountain View, CA, and his colleague in absentia. 

 

 Legal formalities aside, the background issue is: Which is the guilty (or guiltier) party? A litigious corporation with a monopolistic track record in the U.S. And China or independent-minded researchers who branched out on their own?

 

 EE News, quoting the technology journal IHS, describes the plaintiff’s reputation as follows: “IP (intellectual property) is key to the fast-growing (microwave filter) market, prompting ‘industrial espionage, lawsuits and intimidation in Avago’s attempt to dominate the radio-frequency filter market.’” 

 

 Industrial espionage? Well, a company on the scale of Avago-Broadcom (annual revenues $6.9 billion: SEC) accusing the Tianjin Six’s start-up called ROFS Microsystems of being a threat is ridiculous. In other words, the Avago-DOJ case against suspect Hao Zhang is, to cite the IHS term, an intimidation tactic. 

 

 Instead of making wild accusations, the smarter approach to protecting U.S. security would have been to put some venture capital behind Zhang to head a joint venture supported by Tianjin U and USC, to prevent Avago from dominating the acoustic filter market in China, which is the world’s biggest producer of mobile phones.Building mutual trust in a partnership is better than breeding suspicion between foes. The Tianjin Six case was initiated during the Obama-Holder-Comey tenure during their overtly hostile “pivot to Asia”, which intensified Beijing’s distrust of Washington. Resolving the bilateral trade imbalance is a thorny issue left to the Trump team, which should manage the issue by toning down the inflammatory rhetoric. 

 From Trade War to Copyright Dogfight

 

 With the copyright issue coming up next in the U.S.-China trade dispute, everyone should be careful not to make is an “U.S. against them”conflict. The Trump team needs to acknowledge that copyright protection has unfortunately veered away from the original intent of rewarding researchers to being increasingly used as a weapon of litigation to stifle competition. Avago-Broadcom, as IHS pointed out, is notorious for abusing patent protection to justify its monopolistic practices and eliminate competition and rob researchers of a fair share of reward from their R&D.

 

 Taking their cue from Bill Gates’s Microsoft, a pioneer in piratical litigation to hijack and knock out small players, the following generation of cutthroats in the tech sector such as Avago’s Hock Tan and his partner Broadcom’s Henry Samueli have ruthlessly annihilated smaller companies and suppressed employee rights to attain market dominance in the electronics industry, while piling up mega-profits and winning the loyalty of institutional investors. Prior to the 2016 merger with Avago, Broadcom under Samueli’s direct leadership bought out more than 50 tech companies, including NetLogic Microsystems ($3.9 billion), LSI ($6.6 billion), and Brocade Communications ($5.9 billion). It’s a copyright-hungry tyrannosaurus on the prowl. 

 

 Inventions arise out of darkness with the light-bulb flash that inspires individual scientists and engineers along with their research assistants, whereas corporations are non-creative entities that exist to further enrich their executives and major investors. IP (intellectual property) has been surgically removed from the human intellect and, instead, has regressed into a savage Jurassic Park where corporate T-rexes are unloosed against the local vegan brontos while velociraptors chase down to maul frightened scientists. This reign of mindless greed cannot last forever, so the time has come for the revenge of the tiny mammals. Enter the Tianjin Six who dared to take back what’s theirs since the start in a university lab. 

 

 Trump’s crushing of Avago-Broadband’s grasping claws was therefore a long-overdue anti-trust action to curb monopoly domination over markets, a big step much in line with his criticism of Amazon and the social media behemoths spewing fake news. 

 

 The Broadcom assault on Qualcomm has given Americans a bitter taste of what U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is dishing out to China, that is, unreasonably stiff demands for exorbitant copyright fees, the first step toward takeover of local companies. When the added fees are passed on in the product cost, American consumers will ultimately pay the high price for corporate greed. 

 

 The alternative, in an ideal international market, IP laws should be reformed in a direction beneficial and acceptable to all stakeholders including inventors, research staffers, license holders, manufacturers, consumers and investors. Avago-Broadcom provides an abject lesson in how not to push aside others like a fat hog at the trough. Everyone needs to learn how to cut the pie. 

 Trouble from the get-go

 

 As pronounced in the Down Under Aussie dialect: “(h)ave a go at it, mate”, Avago made headlines in November when its CEO, Malaysian tycoon Hock Tan, announced at a White House press conference that he’d help make America great again by moving his headquarters from Singapore to the United States. President Trump nodded with satisfaction, unaware of the knife swing down on his back. The relocation pledge turned out to be a clever ruse, a ploy to gain regulatory approval for the Avago-Broadcom combine’s hostile takeover of rival semiconductor producer Qualcomm, the American company that probably manufactured the router for your Internet service. 

 

 From the start of this Lunar Year of the Dog, the board of Qualcomm adamantly rejected the hostile takeover, despite the fact that its major investors and corporate raiders were licking their chops as Broadcom raised its bid. Realizing the potential harm to the nation from the asset loss, Trump turned against the brazen Malaysian tycoon by nixing the deal, which would have put the world’s 5th largest semiconductor producer under foreign control of the third-biggest company in this sector. It was no idle threat since the ultimate objective of the Avago-Broadcomm assault is to overtake Bosch (Germany) and Texas Instruments (USA), market leaders in MEMS, the microelectronic-mechanical systems that control devices. 

 

 After being publicly shamed by Trump’s bombing of that mega-deal, a downcast Avago has just announced that it will move its headquarters from Singapore to the U.S., perhaps to launch another attempt. So far, Trump wins on all counts, setting the precedent that government should be a regulator or referee of business deals and not a profit-mongering sales promoter in favor of winner-takes-all.

 Before plunging into the sordid details involving Broadcom founder Henry Samueli, a look at the FBI case against the USC graduates needs to be aired out, especially since Agent Kevin Hogg was involved the duplicitous “arrest” of Hao Zhang at LAX, he being the father of the dubious self-promoting Parkland School “hero”, the CNN wannabee cub reporter who was either not at school on that day or cowering under a desk, whichever version of little Davy’s story one prefers to believe. It’s a case of “like father like son”, born to lie. 

 

 On the surface, the FBI nabbed researcher Hao Zhang for allegedly stealing propriety technology of undetermined value to national security a decade ago, charges based on his employment at SkyWorks and his research partner Wen Sun at the Avago branch in Silicon Valley. The secondary plaintiff SkyWorks, located in Massachusetts, has kept a low profile but joined the case possibly due to the fact that nearly 70 percent of its shares are derived from the Pentagon contractor Rockwell, in other words under pressure from the Holder-Lynch Justice Department. In reality, however, the actual circumstances of Zhang’s “arrest” point to a pre-planned CIA economic intelligence operation against China, discussed below.

 

 This obscure copyright trial is massively significant due to the fact that the US vs. Tianjin University is the only current legal action in the high-tech industries related to FBI Director Chris Wray’s claim to the Senate Intelligence Committee of a “Chinese society as a whole” threat to national security, particularly visiting academics and students. The future of more than 200,000 scholars and students from China (and presumably more to be granted or denied student visas) in the USA. Despite their paying tuition and doing research, the fate of this important human bridge with China hinges on this single case in the California Northern Region Court in San Jose, the docket of Silicon Valley. (The only other case involved a Chinese plant geneticist recently convicted for smuggling out GMO test rice seeds, and it remains unclear whether that theft was done to conduct unbiased human-safety tests on U.S. food imports into China. If so, he should be commended instead of serving a prison sentence.)

 

 Why be so hard on such minor players? Because Avago-Broadcom has a huge share of acoustic filter sales to mobile-phone producers China, including Apple and Huawei, and a guilty verdict in this Silicon Valley law case will suppress local competition in that lucrative market. It’s gunboat economics, tech imperialism straight out of the brain-dead CIA-run Economic Intelligence Council. 

 Go to Jail in a game of Monopoly

 

 To reprise: Of the six suspects at Tianjin University, the Justice Department is focusing on two former graduate students at USC’s Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering: Hao Zhang who went on to a job at Skyworks in Massachusetts and Wei Pang, who worked with the Avago lab in Silicon Valley. The pair are accused of stealing proprietary technology related to film-bulk acoustic resonators (FBAR), which are thin-film filters that pick up specific frequencies while blocking “noise” from other signals. The filters for either acoustic (sound) or radio waves are used in microphones (Apple i-Phones use 6 mikes for difference pitches) and other wireless devices. 

 

 A point to note its that the electrical engineering department at private university USC was created with a $35 million grant from Ming Hsieh, who immigrated to the U.S. From Taiwan and was born in mainland China. In contrast with the FBI’s claim of Chinese thievery, Hsieh represents one of the thousands of Chinese-Americans, mainlanders and Taiwanese who have worked hard to massively benefit American society with inventions and jobs, far out of proportion of their small numbers. Zhang and Pang probably would have done similar had they not been cheated out of their research by corporate criminals. 

 

 Hao Zhang is the only suspect in custody, the rest are at Tianjin University (and remain silent due to the law case). In May 2015, en route from China to a tech conference in Phoenix, Zhang was apprehended inside a jetliner still on the runway, immediately after landing at Los Angeles airport. FBI agents escorted him off the plane, leaving behind his wife. The Chinese suspect was taken to a stark room for questioning. Zhang was not informed of his arrest, meaning that the FBI agent did not recite his Miranda right to an attorney. This was because she enticed him with undisclosed benefits for his cooperation as an friendly informant aka a CIA-run spy against China. The illegal offer is completely out of line, and all FBI agents involved including LAX case officer Hogg should be reprimanded and investigated. 

 

 The entrapment scam by Kevin Hogg’s FBI office at LAX indicates a deep-cover espionage effort to infiltrate Tianjin University, with its research prestige in China equivalent to a CalTech or MIT. Was the Obama-Comey-Holder operation appears to have been an attempt to infiltrate the Chinese research establishment preliminary to technology thievery by American spies? Kevin Hogg’s roles in this case and now in the Parkland cover-up is, to say the least, indicative of high-level intrigue at the FBI and CIA. The investigators need to be investigated, because “the whole of American society” is certainly not involved in these reprehensible plots in violation of the Constitution. 

 One of the FBI complaints is that their USC research was partially funded with a grant from DARPA, the defense research agency. There’s nothing exceptional about DARPA funding, which does not limit itself to purely military technology, since it has funded inventions like the Internet. The military signals corps is of course interested in any and all communications technology, the Motorola walkie-talkie being a historic example of dual-use equipment. The FBAR filters, however, are mainly applied to civilian uses including mobile phones and wireless devices. The radio filters can help to prevent jamming of signals but, as compared with encryption systems, are a minor factor in defense technology, and are by no means a massive security threat as suggested by the prosecution in this case. 

 

 At a pre-trial hearing last year, the San Jose district court granted Zhang’s request to obtain documents from primarily plaintiff Avago to ascertain its claim of copyright theft. Avago, however, refused to provide any evidence, meaning its complaint is unverifiable. Be assured whatever Zhang and Sun researched at USC was far in advance of current technology in Avago’s patent vault. At that point when Avago balked, the case against the Tianjin Six should have been dismissed, thrown out of court with apologies to the victim of injustice. 

 

 The refusal to drop charges indicates the Comey-Holder stay-behinds at FBI-DOJ are trying to drag out the Tianjin Six case to sabotage the Trump-Lighthizer-Ross trade negotiations with Chinese counterparts. If so, it’s called treason. 

 

 Hao Zhang is now on trial (which began in late February, some 33 months after his arrest, on charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage (maximum penalty of 15 years in a federal penitentiary) and theft of trade secrets (10 years in prison). Although patently ridiculous, the potential sentences represent a threat to every foreign researcher who contributes his or her ideas and work hours to advance scientific progress in America. Give all you got and then be tossed in jail. That is not the American Way. 

 

 After a spell in a San Jose detention center, Zhang has idled under house arrest. Meanwhile the stolen goods from defense technology are being fenced by Israel and kickbacks are paid to the Pentagon brass, with a little help from its Zionist friend Broadcom. Preferential racial treatment, selective religious bias in favor of Judaism, unvarnished mobster corruption, call it what you will, it all stinks and is in complete violation of the spirit and letter of the constitutional guarantees of a fair trial and equal justice for all. 

 

 

 Hanky spanky in Lala land

 

 On Good Friday, as if in redemption for the negative media coverage of its busted Qualcomm deal, the reneger Hock Tan announced Avago would indeed move its headquarters out of Singapore back to the USA. Although he is a Malaysian of Chinese ethnicity who earned an engineering degree at MIT, the investment behind Avago in Jewish and Zionist. 

 

 The major investor behind Avago is the Newbridge group include the mensch behind Uber, David Bonderman of TPG Capital (Fort Worth); and political fixer Richard Blum, the Democrat Party donor and husband of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, former head of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Another partner in the Asia-oriented fund is ACON, headed by Jonathan Ginns, who got his start as a “management consultant” at Booz, Allen and Hamilton, the spooky CIA-Pentagon contractor (and former employer of Edward Snowden). This should remind us of how the CIA-Booz team in Switzerland boozed up bankers and arranged DUI car crashes for blackmail purposes, felonious crimes that convinced Snowden to blow the whistle. It gets worse due to transfers of sensitive technology to the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) via Technion, or the Israel Institute of Technology, by Broadcom’s Zionist founder and current CTO (chief technology officer) Henry Samueli. The IDF Cyber-command, by its own boast, “is 15 years ahead of every other military”, thanks to the stolen tech flown in from American labs, which have never been investigated or prosecuted by FBI counter-intelligence. 

 

 Avaco’s Bobbsey twin Broadcom was founded in 1992 by the “Two Henrys” out of UCLA engineering school, Samueli and Nicholas, who back then sported mustaches and Yeltsin-era power suits while producing the staple of SoCal suburban homes in that primordial era, set top boxes fed by co-ax. Then-CEO Henry Nicholas was notorious as a corporate slave driver, not only of his engineering staff but also (as Orange County residents recall) for his late-night“hanky spanky”with young prostitutes in his basement. In 2008 Nicholas was cited by local police on drug charges, while the sexual allegations were hushed up, thanks to Orange police bag man. In that same year, Nicholas and his accountant were charged by the SEC with investment fraud for backdating corporate reports. Samueli did his crocodile-tears public repentance by buying the local sports team. No, not the Angels. Guess again. Things that waddle and quack on ice, as in hockey, the Anaheim Ducks, formerly known as Disney’s Mighty Ducks. (There’s a copyright infringement, if ever, since the original looney is Daffy Duck, who belonged at rival Warner Brothers. As I recall from childhood, Daffy did once try to ice-skate, causing consternation for Bugs.) A point to note in passing, the neighbors in the wealthy Crystal Cove shoreline community of Orange County have been outraged by the hostility of his security guards at the Samueli house, who accost passersby on public beach-access paths and conduct electronic surveillance against nearby homes (whose predominantly American Jewish owners are often millionaire CEOs themselves). His corps of thugs, which include military-type divers on jetboats circling the public beach and rocky cape, are referred to in the area as “The Mossad”. (At the end of the video, look for the yellow pin on the shoreline to spot the SoCal base of Israeli military intel.) If on the next time you’re driving to Laguna or Huntington Beach, and your mobile phone starts acting up, just say “Shalom, Henry! It’s Donald. Quack!” 

 

 

 Israeli middlemen are the security risk

 

 As noted by a high-level trade adviser to the government of China, “It’s an open secret that America’s latest technology is offered for sale to India, Vietnam and China by the Israeli middlemen, and you can be sure that the top brass at the Pentagon are making a killing from that trade. Nobody in Washington D.C. wants to change that lucrative black-market arrangement.”

 

 In other words, corruption among American defense officials is the actual reason for the trade ban on high-tech exports to China, where its companies and consumers have to pay inflated prices for the newest technology. A market-driven direct-sales approach, by contrast, would be competitive, transparent and therefor more secure, while eliminating the kickbacks for the crooked generals and admirals, and their neocon civilian employees, that corrode America’s military leadership. Fair terms of access to technology would also reduce the consumer demand of cheap, poor-quality copycat electronic goods. (Let’s hope that due diligence and fair trade practices are the underlying aim of trade rep Lighthizer’s copyright negotiations.)

 

 National security and peace worldwide would be far better served and protected if American defense contractors were to directly engage with Chinese companies (and even its armed forces) under clear marketing rules rather than treacherous back-door deals done through the Israeli front company, for example, the creepy Sino-Israel committee headed by a former Mossad chief. As things now stand, the illicit Israeli arms trade is making Asia a more dangerous region, which is terrible for American national security. 

 The brains behind MAGA 

 

 The FBI hue and cry against Chinese researchers, and its dubious case against Hao Zhang, Sun Wei and their non-involved colleagues at Tianjin University, are parts of a crude propaganda campaign to protect the bloated federal bureaucracy from populist demands to downsize government. The anti-Chinese rhetoric is also fueling an irrational “trade war” of national egos at a time when bilateral trade (along with the entire system of world commerce) needs to be pruned back drastically under a methodical strategy to avert a global depression. Aimed at the reallocation of production around the world, globalization theory over past decades also promoted trade for its own sake, resulting in unsustainable imbalances, sovereign debt crises, household bankruptcies and a surplus of goods of shoddy quality. Cutting trade levels is now the only way to prevent a wave of defaults, total collapse of banks and another worldwide great depression.

 

 Meanwhile, innocent Chinese professors and students in the U.S., along with Asian American academics are being scapegoated for these macroeconomic problems and hammered with unfair demotion and firings at American universities amid threats of legal prosecution. The unfairly tarnished researchers include Xiaoxing Xi, a naturalized citizen who’s been demoted from his position as the physics department head at Temple University and hydrologist Sherry Chen with the U.S. Weather Service in 2014. It should be expected of researchers to share their findings and academic papers in an open exchange with peers in the U.S. and overseas. A nation like the USA that espouses freedom of expression and openness to new ideas must demonstrate the courage to set an example for more timid societies. The risks are minimal, considering the extent of American power and its light-year technological lead. The ultimate losers from unequal treatment are native-born American college students and U.S. companies that depend on ideas and inspiration from the best minds of China and the rest of Asia. Without their presence in teaching positions, U.S. students would be relegated to a second-best education, a situation that will never make America great again. At the Winter Olympics, the USA turned in a third-rate performance. That sort of underachievement must not happen to its world-leading university system. To ensure national greatness into the future, students in the USA should enjoy the privilege of learning from the world’s best professors. Persecuting Chinese mathematicians and scientists is the academic equivalent of rejecting ski instructors from Norway and Germany. It is self-defeating folly.

 

 Hopefully, in its overhaul of the federal government and in reasoned trade negotiations with China, the Trump team will put an end to the blatant anti-Asian bias from the Obama-Holder-Comey dominated FBI-DOJ and restore the principle of justice for all. If the obviously innocent Hao Zhang is alone at the top of the suspect list, then it means the FBI really has nothing to go on and is just chasing after ghosts of its own imagining. Let him go home or, even better, encourage him, after an official apology, to conduct research in the U.S. and contribute his ideas to MAGA. And to be helpful, that in-bred liar Davy Hogg should open his mouth only for a taste of pizza.

New documents released recently showed a conspiracy to frame the 33 year war hero.

It is an elaborate coup attempt that failed and is looking like the case for indictments for conspiracy and sedition for many people may be coming from AG Barr and his prosecutor John Durham.

339,"Have you ever struggled with the question of when it’s time to leave a relationship? Are you plagued with doubt about whether or not you will have made a mistake in breaking up with your partner and will suffer regret?

Sure, people often leave relationships too soon, before they have healed their own issues that they’ve brought to the “relationship system.”

If you choose to leave during a state of blaming your partner for your unhappiness, then you may take unhealthy patterns with you and re-create the same problems in your next relationship. Ending a relationship requires care, consideration, and questioning.

However, there are non-negotiable signs that it’s time to leave your partner. Here are three urgent indications that it’s time to end your relationship:

If you are in a physically abusive relationship, it’s time to leave. Period. Even if your partner agrees to get help, you need to leave until change actually occurs. Leaving the relationship will feel hard, but it is the right decision.

Even if your partner simply threatens physical abuse (but doesn’t act on it), you need to leave. Threats have the potential to be physically dangerous, and are emotionally abusive. You don’t want to put yourself in such a position to be manipulated.

If your partner is consistently verbally and emotionally abusive, this is another sign you need to leave. Verbal abuse can tear down your self-esteem, and that can have further, detrimental effects — both on your body and your mind.

It’s absolutely essential that you accept the fact that you have no control over whether or not your partner is abusive. You are not the cause.

If your partner has a personality disorder, such as Narcissistic Personality Disorder or Borderline Personality Disorder, and is not getting help, you may need to leave. It can be very painful to be at the other end of some of the behaviors of those dealing with a personality disorder.

Many people don’t know about what constitutes a personality disorder, even if they are familiar with some of the behaviors that might indicate a personality disorder. Expert Randi Kreger has referred to those with personality disorder as “high conflict persons.” They exhibit common behaviors — they tend to idealize you and then criticize you, project their emotions onto you, embarrass you, take advantage of you, demand things from you, lie to you.

It’s true that personality disorders can be healed with a lot of inner work. But it can be incredibly self-destructive to feel like you are waiting around others to improve themselves so your relationship can heal. You don’t deserve to sit around waiting while they continue to detract from your life by causing emotional destruction.

If your partner is an alcoholic, drug addict, gambler, sex addict, spending addict, or addicted to anything else that may be causing them, you, or anyone else harm or pain, you may need to leave — especially if they are not receiving help for the addiction.

Your partner may be able to deal with and overcome the addiction, but it might not be the right time for them to be investing in a relationship.

To get over an addiction, your partner will need to dedicate serious work toward personal growth, and it might be a struggle for him or her to put in the necessary work toward self-improvement, while also trying to be an attentive partner.

These three signs are some of the most common non-negotiable reasons to leave your relationship. Of course, a common — and very important — reason may simply be that you feel stuck and disconnected in your relationship. This may not be abuse. But it is a reason to leave.

For instance, if you are interested in personal growth and your partner has not been interested in changing at all, you might find that you have outgrown your partner. When you met each other, you both might have been abandoning yourselves in various ways, but through your personal growth, you might now be taking responsibility for yourself.

Leaving isn’t easy. Ask yourself, “Is leaving an act of self-care? Is there more for me to learn in this relationship, or can I best learn and grow outside of this relationship?” If you are honest with yourself, you will know the answers to these questions.

1300,"Our long national nightmare is over! Deadline reported yesterday, and everyone confirmed soon after, that Walt Disney changed their mind about that whole “firing James Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” thing. After abruptly and suddenly firing the filmmaker this past July following the unearthing of some off-color tweets from his Troma days (jokes concerning, among other things, pedophilia), the film has been in flux. It was never officially canceled, but it was delayed indefinitely and most certainly was not going to be the (presumed) Phase Four premiere MCU flick in May of 2020. Dave Bautista threatened to walk, the entire cast signed a “round robin” letter of disapproval and the Internet at large all had their say one way or another.

The hand-wringing was partially about who unearthed those tweets, namely (among others) known Pizzagate conspiracy peddler and rape apologist Mike Cernovich in an act of political retaliation. At the time, it looked like the biggest media company on earth, which is about to own Fox as well, had made a major creative decision on impulse and via the machinations of known bad actors of (arguably) disagreeable politics. Whether those old jokes constituted a fire-able offense, the issue was that the Mouse House had allowed some very not nice/arguably hypocritical people to claim a very prominent scalp from the great and powerful Walt Disney. After months of being unable to find a replacement director, Gunn is back in the director’s chair. Peace in our time?

The only person who didn’t really speak up was Gunn himself, who essentially stated (more or less) “I disagree with their decision but defend Disney’s right to make it.” That’s partially what led to him getting rehired, along with the deluge of high-profile MCU folk who voiced their support, Disney’s inability to find a person willing to take over the project (whether or not they looked is open to speculation) and (presumably) wanting to appear, on the eve of the Fox takeover, not able to be swayed by keyboard bullies with an axe to grind. Whatever the case, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is now a lot more likely to happen than it was 24 hours ago, with Gunn being allowed to finish his trilogy.

This are a little more complicated than they might seem. Since the film got delayed, it will no longer be the “season premiere” movie for Marvel’s post-Avengers Endgame saga. Unless Disney is able to offer new pre-GotGv3 MCU movies that don’t necessarily further along the big story and thus can wait until 2021 or 2022 before launching what would have been the big cosmic narrative begun by Guardians Vol. 3, then the movie will have to be rejiggered a little bit compared to whatever the story was going to be prior to last summer. While not a fatal blow, it highlights to what extent Walt Disney shot themselves in the foot with their biggest IP rather than initially taking a moment to evaluate the situation.

Oh, and after being tossed out of the MCU, James Gunn found himself working for DC Films. Yes, Gunn was hired by Warner Bros. to write and direct The Suicide Squad, a sequel/soft-reboot to David Ayer’s financially successful ($745 million on a $175m budget) but critically-trashed supervillain ensemble flick. This was an ironic hiring, since the first Suicide Squad was seen at the time as DC’s attempts to mimic the success of Guardians of the Galaxy. To a certain extent it did, since the movie made about as much as the first Guardians ($333m/$773m in 2014) on a similar budget. Either James Gunn ditches Suicide Squad 2 and sticks with Guardians 3 or he ends up directing both potentially similar comic book superhero sequels.

As of now, Gunn will allegedly do both movies and Disney is letting him do Suicide Squad before Guardians of the Galaxy. Even if that happens, Disney has still succeeded in undercutting the DC Films sequel. The Suicide Squad movie (which sees Idris Elba replacing Will Smith and a mostly new crew of DCU baddies joining Task Force X) was a big deal partially so because it was James Gunn bringing his brand to DC Films. With Gunn back to helm Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, The Suicide Squad can’t help but look like a lesser movie. Not unlike Paramount/Viacom’s Star Trek reboot flaming out after Star Wars returned, it’s hard to get too excited for the pretender when the genuine article comes back to town.

DC Films may be in a position in August of 2021 where The Suicide Squad is not a do-or-die project. I’m not allowed to talk about Shazam yet, but I may be taking my older kids to that nationwide sneak preview next Saturday. So the extent to which James Gunn returning to “Guardians of the Galaxy Classic” will be a potential blow to “Diet Guardians of the Galaxy” will be proportional to how healthy of a brand DC Films happens to be after Shazam, Joker, Birds of Prey, Wonder Woman 1984 and The Batman. Whether by coincidence or design, Disney’s rehiring of Gunn has not only turned a loss into a possible win but undercut what might have been a win for its biggest rival.

The other result of this, combined with Captain Marvel (which may cross $700 million worldwide today), is that the MCU does not really need the X-Men or Fantastic Four characters to juice up the post-Avengers Endgame line-up. Captain Marvel showed that the MCU can propel a new franchise built around a new character, even one that gets merely “pretty good” reviews, to (maybe) $400m-plus domestic and (probably) $1 billion-plus worldwide. Marvel’s unofficial Phase Four dance card filling up pretty quickly with the likes of Black Panther 2, Doctor Strange 2, Guardians 3, Eternals, Black Widow and Shang-Chi among others. The ability to position Dr. Doom and Galactus as new big bads (or Goose’s henchmen) notwithstanding, there is little urgency to plop the X-Men into the MCU continuity.

Even with the MCU scheduling now out of whack, it’s nice that the Mouse House swallowed their pride and undid an unforced error, especially considering the source of the controversy. If Disney/Fox is really going to control theatrical moviegoing (with only Warner Bros. and Universal putting up a fair fight) and be one of the three biggies in the streaming wars (Disney versus Amazon versus Netflix), then it’s useful to know that they won’t get tricked into self-sabotage at the whims on an online pundit or two. eight months after he was fired, James Gunn will (again) write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. If this does any damage to The Suicide Squad, then it’ll again be a scenario where Disney wins even for losing.",mainstream
602,"The wildest single phenomenon as we come close to a clearer picture of the Democratic Party’s election strategy for 2020, is that there really isn’t a single candidate that the party has been able to coalesce around.

And without this, it would appear difficult to see whether the Democrats intend to focus their strategy on flipping the Rust Belt or the Sun Belt states blue. The truth is that this really isn’t their strategy at all. It’s their strategy to talk about these strategies.

But what they will rely on instead is something far more dark and sinister – something we’ve already seen and felt the ramifications of, and something every vigilant citizen needs to focus their primary concerns on.

What strategy won’t work for Democrats? The one they’ve been trying since Trump won.

Most of the chatter we’ve seen so far tends to focus on that question, Rust Belt or Sun Belt (or both), and then which set of policies should the party focus on, and then naturally who will be the candidate to deliver the victory on that platform.

It’s well understood how misleading it is to look at the wide margin at the level of the Electoral College that saw Trump’s sweep. In the real battle-ground states, his victory was in some cases incredibly slim. If three or four of those states had gone for Clinton, then we’d be in a very different electoral reality today. So it goes without saying that Democrats think that they only need to keep all the states they won in 2016, and ‘simply’ (oh, it will not be simple!) flip three or four swing states.

This is very ‘by the books’ and old-model thinking however, and it’s precisely this lack of imagination that saw Democrats lose in 2016. They ran a top-down campaign, not realizing that we live in a post-modern electoral paradigm, where voters are less motivated in ways that can even be broken down by states, state politics, or state interests in the old sense. Yes, mid-term elections tell us something, but this translates less and less so to national politics. We are moving away from the swing-state, and towards the swing-individual.

The internet, at the risk of being extraordinarily cliché, keeps changing the rules. But it’s true. While state secession sentiments actually grow, politics itself has become increasingly national-oriented and also broader in scope – that is to say, paradigmatic.

Trump’s people brilliantly understood that something more was needed in addition to the standard stitching together the standard Republican big tent coalition of anti-Coastal fly-over country America, Christian Zionists and evangelicals, with small-government, low tax business conservatives.

They understood that there had to be a bigger story, a grand narrative, an entire paradigm. Something that would penetrate Reddit and 4Chan, and go full-on memetic. Tropes like the ‘Rising Chinese Menace’, ‘Pizza Gate’, the unappreciated and ‘politically incorrect White Man’, and even some Ron Paul related tropes related to currency ‘metal heads’ and the Fed – these came together to give his campaign some meaning, and meaning is what motivates the grass roots in the digital era.

Not ‘policies’ in the mundane think-tank, policy wonk sense of the term. No, not at all. If Occupy Wall Street taught us anything, is that what has radicalized people is not this or that policy – even though polling people by policy will naturally (obviously) produce policy-edible results – but instead people are radicalized by the much larger questions of our time.

And Democrats keep referring to these, because as an institutional machine, this is what it’s built on, this is the essence of its bureaucratic inertia, and where the relationships exist.

Democrats will have to use the institutions and machines they have built, not the ones they should have been building and haven’t.

What strategy will Democrats try?

In contrast to this paradigmatic approach which is required to win, Democrats seem to be stuck in trying to simulate grass roots, through the older model of ‘grass roots organizations’, a series of endorsements by way of Astro-turfing, and relying on the mobilization of students at the orders of professors and teachers, and of organized labor by order of the shop steward and internal organizer, following the SEIU model that saw Obama elected in swing-states states like Colorado.

But as Democrats have switched posture to being a pro-war party, they are seriously going to be lacking in the activism of the anti-war constituency, a constituency which may indeed view Trump at least neutrally. And trying to switch the anti-war elements of the most progressive, leftist wing of the party and the ‘left of the party adjacent’, into a pro-war party of xenophobic pogromist, neo-McCarthyite Russophobic minions, would seem to be a Herculean task. That is, of course, if those elements still have internet access. And herein lies the rub.

Democrats are going to have to rely on the most sinister and anti-democratic strategy, one that threatens democracy itself

The very sick and sad reality is that Democrats are working directly with the internet tech and platform giants, Google-Adsense, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Amazon, to broaden the scope of censorship, to shut down websites, to deplatform, demonetize, and derank thousands of YouTube vloggers, even big ones, and shadow-ban countless tens, even hundreds of thousands more.

They are creating an ever-more walled garden, a fake internet, the very thing American Sinophones have been accusing the Chinese of doing. And strangely, the average Chinese appears to be more plugged into the inner-workings of American life and politics than the other way around – so much for censorship.

This is the single-most winning component of their strategy. Democrats have an institutional machine that cannot win using the internet as it had evolved until around 2016 – the war now has been a war against the internet and its denizens themselves, against online activism which challenges the status quo – even if its anti-Trump on issues of war and imperialism, since the Democrats themselves promise at least as much if not more.

If the Democrats cannot beat the internet, they will destroy it. And destroying it they have been doing.

While censorship strategy this is the main idea for their campaign – to silence the genuine progressives and socialists in their own party, and to double-down on censoring the broadly paradigmatic elements of Trump’s organic and grass-roots base – they will need to plaster on some kind of plausible pseudo-strategy to get them from here to there. And as we have seen, there isn’t really a candidate. Democrats are lacking in anyone that has anything to say, because the Democrats aren’t looking forward, they are trying to turn the clock backwards to reproduce a political geography that existed twelve years ago as Obama-esque tropes gained ascendency. To do this means to erase the real-existing internet, under the rubric of a war against ‘fake news’, and ‘alternate facts’. Only here can they win, using a victory by the numbers, not winning the battle of ideas.

This time around, their push-polling and fake-polling might work. This is the plan that aims to get their candidate to win by claiming that their candidate is winning, in all the news online or TV that you’d ever have a chance to see. They thereby win low-cognitive undecideds who want to vote for the projected winner, for low-cognitive and base-emotional reasons at the level of the amygdala, as was their plan in 2016. This plan would have worked except for the digital democracy of paradigmatic proportions, the one that Trump so masterfully mobilized, and so it is clear and obvious that Democrats aim to win by erasing digital freedoms, since the 1st amendment questions haven’t been properly sorted in the digital era. The big tech and platform firms are private agencies, have their own bizarre and discriminatory TOS’s, and have been censoring and deplatforming anyone who sniffs of paradigm.

Who are Democrats pushing on the public as the potentials?

Biden, Harris, Sanders Booker, O’Rourke, Warren, even Yang to some extent. Surely, but they don’t give us a whole lot. Besides Yang, what do any of these candidates really stand for? Like Yang, all of these candidates appear to tend to focus on single-issue policy questions; Warren with student loan debt; Harris isn’t so much an issue candidate as she is a symbolic one; and with the exception of Yang, no-one is broadly paradigmatic.

O’Rourke has charisma, and has some of the appeal of a Kennedy meets Jimmy Stewart. This Jimmy Stewart vibe carries with it both pop-psychologist and YouTube celebrity Jordan Peterson, along with elements of Ron Paul vibes. On the subconscious level, telegraphing and channeling this tremendously powerful essence has carried O’Rourke this far. Added is O’Rourke’s relative youth, indie rock scene credentials, and some resonance with the Latino community – that’s all he really has to stand on. Like the forgettable Tim what’s-his-name-? Kaine, these are white men who nominally stand for the Latino community. O’Rourke goes by Beto, like Kaine speaks Spanish.

Besides the actual strategy of relying on internet censorship, the nominal, plastered, plausible strategy is to run everyone at once, until the very end. There isn’t a single candidate because democrats in fact do not have a candidate to run. They have a censorship plan, and then simply run half a dozen people simultaneously and work their virtual supporters up into some ‘anyone but Trump’ frenzy, with each candidate taking the historic vow to officially throw their support and their supporters behind the candidate that wins the DNC primaries.

This is a very interesting approach strategically, because historically we’d find coalescence around a sense of the general electoral paradigm we are in first – the real set of issues at play – and then narrow down the candidates based on who best serves, or reflects, that paradigm in terms of electability, charisma, and ability to deploy a field campaign, especially in the swing states. That was the case for Obama in 2008.

For Obama, coming off of eight years of Bush and the destruction of the neoconservative brand, it was a simple strategy that worked in the targeted states. The anti-war demographic while not huge in their own, are among the most active campaigners who are absolutely fine with adjusting their talking points to reach voters on the ideas and policies that matter to them most, anything to unseat the ‘war monger in chief, Bush’. The rise of the national security state, Homeland Security, the wars in the middle-east, Guantanamo Bay and torture, extraordinary rendition, warrantless tapping and spying on Americans at home – these all had the civil libertarians against Bush as well.

Necessary for Obama’s victory also was a very strong appeal to the progressive left, still based in the last generation’s relationship to symbolic politics.

To be clear, symbolic politics of this type no longer motivates new voters, who are economically and culturally at odds with the present system, and aren’t looking for a symbolic politics based in abstract progressivism, if it doesn’t reflect in their own pocket-books and employment opportunities. That is, after all, one of the biggest reasons that Trump took the swing states in 2016. The symbolic politics that elected Obama won’t work for Democrats again, even if they tap the double-minority vein of Harris. The reality is that even Democrat voters are no longer interested in a candidate to best represent or serve the underserved or underrepresented if those are conceived of as some ‘urban other’. The reality is that the middle-class progressive base of Democrat activism really no long exists. It began to evaporate under Obama’s policies themselves, in 2008 with quantitative easing, when the too big to fail banks were bailed out, instead of Americans themselves.

Democrat strategy unlocked – Silence the Public, pretend Clinton isn’t in charge, and run half a dozen candidates representing some puerile pastiche of demography, until the very end.

While at first glance this may seem to be reflective of an incoherent strategy, we need to step back and see how there is indeed a certain logic at play here. Censorship will have a huge impact on this election, and all politics moving forward.

Not having a single candidate to focus on, that is, to draw fire on, isn’t the same thing as not having a single strategy. Single candidates and single strategies are not the same thing, not in the DNC, which is still clearly under a unified command structure under H.R Clinton. Yes indeed.

It’s clear to insiders and anyone nominally looking at the facts on paper that the DNC is still a Clinton monopoly, there was at least some thinking, at least for some time, that the technocratic and professional elements of the party who actually want to win the race, were having some significant pull. We saw signs of this in early 2017 when Tom Perez came into to chair the DNC, a former Obama Secretary of Labor in the second term, signaling at least symbolically that team blue was breaking out of the Clinton club – at least that which was dedicated to the cult of Clinton.

But to believe this, one would have to believe the old insider story going back to 2007 that Clinton and Obama represent different power factions within the party. But given that, besides the necessary myths and promises required to get elected, the real point of Democratic Party governance relates to the international questions. And H.R Clinton’s role as Secretary of State saw the significant transatlantic networking and alliances necessary to pull off the Arab Spring and the Ukrainian Maidan. And so even here it’s wildly questionable that Obama was much more than a Clinton faction ally, at best.

The Democrats’ real problem here and now is that Clinton is widely despised by real voters, especially the kinds of voters that the party needs to win in the old and emergent swing states alike. That means that the party has to give off some essence, some inkling, some notion that the DNC and the party itself isn’t still run by Clinton.

And this will be very hard to do, given that it is. The way that Sanders entirely buckled under the weight of the DNC’s corruption and gaming the delegate process during the nomination process, only served to induct a new generation of progressive voters – the real activists of the party generally tied to organized labor and astro-turf community organizations on the NGO model – into the ‘anyone but Hillary’ camp.

That’s to say that the party strategy to win the White House in 2020 can’t be based around some focus on Hillary Clinton in any way. This is the real kicker. What we’ve seen until recently to be frank is, rather than a positive program moving forward, is instead a never ending series of accusations and apologia – in the non-remorseful, Greek sense of the word – on how and why Clinton was robbed of the election. This in turn, however, has had profound effects on censorship and the erosion of digital democracy.

More recently we’ve seen some major concessions from Democratic Party leaders in their talking points around some of the culture-war issues, and related to that, immigration policy. Democrats, in tandem with their transatlantic neoliberal partners in the EU, especially in the case of France with Macron, have begun to push in a populist direction on immigration. In plain terms, Democrats hope to win over the ‘moderate’ cross section of the ‘build the wall’ crowd, at least in swing states where that subject ranks in the top five but under the top three main concerns.

But such concessions may act, in reality, not as game-changers but instead as plausible-deniability insurance, that they won voters this way, and not through a possibly illegal collaboration and collusion with the Silicon Valley tech and platform giants.

The initial ‘excitement’, scare quotes intentional, around Joe Biden’s announcement in April that he would be in the race, has steadily deflated ever since, by and by a startling rate.

When we look at the overall picture, it is difficult to see Biden being the candidate. But given that Biden has his own ‘grab em by the p%$$#’ reputation, is both white and a male, and has a masculine-aggressive personality component – important demographic cross-sections for Trump – these may all indeed, in the end, serve successfully as cover for the Democrats plan to steal this election through censorship.

1199,"The Washington, D.C. pizzeria that was at the center of the conspiracy theory dubbed Pizzagate continues to be a source of controversy even after claims of the alleged child sex slave ring linked to Hillary Clinton have been debunked.

On Thursday, The Washingtonian reported that picketers had swarmed Comet Ping Pong, harassing passersby, and shouting homophobic, sexist and xenophobic slurs.

A local business owner confirmed to FoxNews.com that the protesters have continued to picket the restaurant early on Inauguration Day.

“President Obama is nothing more than a Muslim,” “Homosexuals will burn in a hellfire,” “Go back into the kitchen, you woman,” were among the phrases being shouted Friday morning, Matt Carr, owner of the coffee shop Little Red Fox told FoxNews.com in an email. The coffee shop is located next door to the pizzeria.

The group, which the Washingtonian says calls itself the “Official Street Preachers,” had about 10 picketers outside Comet Ping Pong on Friday morning, Carr said. He added that two police officers were standing by.

Comet Ping Pong became the center of a growing online conspiracy theory in 2016 after sites like Planet Free Will, YourNewsWire.com and the Vigilant Citizen publishing stories linking an underground pedophilia ring to the pizza joint. Snopes and other media subsequently debunked the claims and the articles have since been taken down.

But the conspiracy theory prompted 28-year-old Edgar Maddison Welch to fire an assault rifle inside the restaurant in December. No one was harmed during the shootout but Welch, who was later arrested, claimed he wanted to investigate the conspiracy for himself.

""I just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way,"" Welch told the New York Times after surrendering to police when he found no evidence of children being used as sex slaves.

On Friday, Carr said that customers outnumbered the protesters within minutes, and that the picketers have not negatively impacted business at Comet nor at Little Red Fox.

“We are busier because our neighborhood is incredibly supportive,” Carr said when asked if the controversy over the last few months had affected business.

The Chevy Chase restaurants located on Connecticut Avenue, are just blocks from vice president Mike Pence’s temporary rental property. Earlier this week, hundreds activists danced through the neighborhood with glow sticks and rainbow flags to champion LGBT rights.

A spokesperson from Comet Ping Pong was not immediately available for comment Friday morning.",mainstream

The interstellar object appeared by the sun a year ago, and disappeared from view in January.

At first scientists assumed it was a comet, then an asteroid, before acknowledging that it was unlike anything they had ever detected before — 400 metres long by 40 metres wide, tumbling end over end and travelling at speeds of up to 315,000 kilometres an hour.

Researchers in Hawaii gave it a romantic name, Oumuamua, meaning ""a messenger that reaches out from the distant past.""

But it took two Harvard University professors to make it famous, via a new paper which suggests that the unexplained object might be some sort of alien probe.

The evidence to support this notion is a bit scant, but the search for extraterrestrial life has always required a certain amount of imagination.

Take, for example, a paper published late last month in the International Journal of Astrobiology, which theorizes that the reason we haven't yet found alien life is that we're looking for little green men instead of purple ones.

The study, by two American microbiologists, suggests that the first forms of life on Earth might have been a shade of lavender, because they captured solar energy via a molecule called retinal, which made both the organisms and whole planet appear purple. Something we might be missing in the cosmos because we're busy looking for the ""red edge"" reflection of far-away worlds filled with green plant life.

Or maybe it's just because we've hardly looked at all.

A bunch of mathematicians at Pennsylvania State University recently created a brain-stretching model that tries to capture just how much space we have yet to scour for alien life — eight dimensions with a volume of 6.4 × 10116 m5Hz2 s/W, which sounds awfully large. (This MIT Technology Review article comes up with a helpful analogy; if we were searching the world's oceans, we've basically mapped out the equivalent of a hot tub so far.)

Even before the new Oumuamua theory, the search for extraterrestrials was heating up.

Last month, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine unveiled a U.S. Congress-mandated report on the future of space exploration, which calls on NASA to look for signs of alien life as part of every mission. Now that we have discovered thousands of exoplanets, we should always be on the lookout for the possible biosignatures of otherworldly creatures, the study argues, calling on the U.S. space agency to develop ""flight ready instruments"" and imaging systems to carry out the search.

Meanwhile, the Trillion Planet Survey, a new project at the University of California Santa Barbara, is using a ""pipeline"" of software to process images of the Andromeda galaxy. It's looking for evidence of optical signals from faraway civilizations, instead of the radio waves we have been listening for since the early 1960s.

And a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal this week suggests that Earthlings adopt a similar signalling approach, creating a powerful 1 or 2 megawatt laser beacon to beam our presence into deep space — turning on what one of the scientists calls ""Earth's Porch Light.""

Over the past few months, the U.S. Congress has been considering whether it should again start funding the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence project, better known as SETI, reversing 25 years of indifference.

And then there's Donald Trump's calls for the creation of Space Force, a new branch of the U.S. military. The American president has suggested that there's a need to safeguard the world in case other powers like Russia and China decide to wage war outside the atmosphere.

But conspiracy theorists aren't convinced. They think the real purpose of Space Force is to fight off a pending alien attack.

However, given that the theory's main proponent is the same website that spread the anti-Democrat ""pizzagate"" whopper, it is surely ""fake news.""

Adrienne Arsenault is in Nashville, Tenn., covering the U.S. midterm elections.

""Shake it off, shake it off"" is the less-than-original, more-than-gleeful Twitter taunt to Tennessee's Taylor Swift this morning.

She of the ""Go vote"" Instagram post — urging those in the state to register and cast their ballot for Democrat Phil Bredesen for senator — was mercilessly mocked online as soon as Republican Marsha Blackburn was declared the winner last night.

The superstar may mope at the result, but the nudge to get Tennesseans engaged may indeed have made a difference. While the wait is on for total turnout numbers, there was a 700 per cent boost in young voters in Tennessee in early voting compared to the 2014 midterms.

That's not a typo. The caveat, though, is that Tennessee ranked dead last in turnout in 2014, so any improvement will boost the percentages.

So yes, the enthusiasm is a win. The taunts are less so.

Tennessee is a curious place for the way it seems to be trying to tamp down some of the nastiness in American political discourse, and its newspapers appear to be leading the charge. The Chattanooga Times Free Press, for example, makes a point to always ensure it has two editorials, one liberal and one conservative.

The Tennessean newspaper is going a little farther — last January it launched Civility Tennessee, a year-long project that is dedicated to highlighting those who reach across divides. The editors appear to go well out of their way to find the people who manage to disagree without rancor and seek solutions that look like compromises.

The goal seems to be to avoid what some refer to as a ""long-term civic divorce.""

Which brings us back to last night.

The democratic candidate was trying to ride that civility wave. Bredesen made a point of saying he would work with anyone, President Trump included, if he thought it would be best for Tennessee.

Until the dawn of voting day, the pollsters thought this grand experiment in the spirit of civility might work, might send a message that moderate voices could be the future.

But the conservative south stayed red, and elected a senator who campaigned in the image of the President. Blackburn warned of the dangers of the caravan, encouraged the building of the border wall, and slammed her opponent.

That's politics. And that's particularly politics now, with the middle ground still elusive.

All this makes the Civility project so much more curious. The experiment ends in two months. It'll be worth checking in to see what, if anything, has changed.

For Sol Messinger, a formal apology from Canada has been a long, long time coming, writes producer Perlita Stroh.

""Well, you know that picture with the little boy, it's a famous picture, it always makes me think that could have been me,"" says Sol Messinger.

He was referring to the iconic, grainy black-and-white image of a young boy raising his hands as he surrendered to German troops in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943.

Messinger is one of a group of about 900 Jewish refugees who tried to escape the horrors of the holocaust by leaving Europe on the MS St. Louis. He set sail for Cuba with his family in 1939 before World War II broke out.

But Cuba turned the ship back, and Canada and the U.S. both refused it entry. At the time, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King argued that opening Canada's door to any of the refugees would lead to further claims after the war.

The ship eventually took its passengers back to Europe, where many died at the hands of the Nazis.

Today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is formally apologizing to the Jewish community for Canada's refusal to offer sanctuary to any of those refugees.

Miraculously, Sol's family survived the war — but not without trauma. They were arrested and sent to a detention camp in France, where living conditions were brutal. They were separated and starved before escaping and securing passage on another ship bound for the U.S. in 1942.

Of the passengers on the MS St. Louis, 288 were sent to England and survived. Another 87 managed to leave Europe in 1940. Of those who didn't find sanctuary from the Nazis, 278 survived the holocaust and 254 perished in concentration camps in Europe.

""I think the Canadian apology is really important for Canadians, for Canadian youth, because it's important for them to say we did this and we were wrong, and we hope that we never do that again,"" Messinger says.

While researching a story about a memorial to Canadian Pte. George Price, the last British Empire soldier killed in WWI, producer Stephanie Jenzer and her team discovered a remarkable radio recording in the CBC archives — as well as a community that has embraced his memory.

While many Canadians may know Pte. George Price from history books, few know him quite as intimately as the Belgians.

Price, born in Nova Scotia in 1892, is widely believed to be the last Commonwealth soldier killed during the First World War. He was shot by a sniper, on Belgian soil, unaware that a war that had already claimed more than 60,000 of his compatriots was itself heaving its final dying breaths.

Across Canada and around the world there are countless monuments to the fallen, just like Price. But many are impressionistic markers, whether it's that towering symbol of sacrifice at Vimy or a small cenotaph in a community near you. They are memorials that honour all who gave their lives to war.

But that last victim of the Great War had a name and a face many wanted to hold onto. Not because his story was particularly special, but precisely because it was a symbol of so much more — of the inexplicable loss and senseless tragedy that all too often comes with war.

Here is a remarkable bit of radio tape we managed to dig up in the CBC archives, a 1965 CBC interview with a veteran named Arthur Goodmurphy. He describes being with Pte. Price on patrol that day in 1918, and how the soldier was shot and fell lifeless into his arms just two minutes before the armistice came into effect at 11 a.m. almost 100 years ago.

There are other perhaps more romantic versions of Price's final moments, including the story of a young woman who waved to him from across a road, prompting him to step out from the protection of a house into the line of fire.

But while some of the fine details have varied slightly over the past century, the municipality of Le Roeulx, near Mons Belgium, has remained unwaveringly loyal and grateful to the man, and the name George Price.

There's the school named in his honour. And there's quite a long footbridge dedicated to Price as well, not to mention the woman who lives next to the bridge who greets visitors at the door with a portrait of him clutched close to her heart.

And now, there's a new addition to Le Roeulx's growing testament to their Canadian hero — a monument commissioned and sculpted in Price's honour.

Belgian artist Sylvain Patte has laboured over the statue in a nearby quarry for many months — much of 2018, in fact. He drew inspiration from, among other things, spending a night in the very spot Price is believed to have been killed.

CBC correspondent Nahlah Ayed, videographer Pascal Leblond and I recently spent some time with Patte and the massive pieces of bluestone that he has carved and buffed and readied for a grand unveiling this coming Remembrance Day weekend.

To give you a sense of the respect the Pte. George Price name commands locally, Le Roeulx has an official population of just 8,500 people, yet a Belgian Princess and the Prime Minister are scheduled to show up for the occasion.

Canada will get its own sneak peek, with a special documentary on the life and legacy of Pte. George Price tonight on The National. The monument may not be what everyone expects, but it's a good bet you will find it memorable.

After all, as Sylvain Patte told us, it's important to preserve history for the children.

A guest swimming in the outdoor pool on the roof of Montreal's Place Bonaventure hotel sees an odd object with flashing lights in the sky and tells the lifeguard, setting off a chain reaction. Soon the police, a newspaper reporter and the RCMP are also there trying to figure out where the huge, metallic disc — estimated to be 540 metres wide — came from. It didn't belong to the Canadian military, and there was nothing showing on the radar at Dorval and Mirabel airports. Three hours later, the lights stopped flashing and the object disappeared.

769,"The story seems to encapsulate many of the elements that makes Congress so susceptible to harassment. Conyers, as its longest-serving member, is the dean of the House of Representatives. To give a sense of what that means, he was elected in 1965, and boasted last week during a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, of which he is the ranking Democratic member, that he was on Nixon’s enemies list. That makes him a great example of entrenched male power.

Second, the story shows how members (or their aides) can quietly hide payments to accusers, helping to cover up allegations and the cost to taxpayers of settling them. Typically, confidential payments are made from a special U.S. Treasury fund established for the purpose. The Washington Post reported, “Between 1997 and 2014, the U.S. Treasury has paid $15.2 million in 235 awards and settlements for Capitol Hill workplace violations, according to the congressional Office of Compliance. The statistics do not break down the exact nature of the violations.”

These payments are often small in comparison with private-sector agreements, and because they are confidential, citizens cannot know where taxpayer dollars are going, nor can they use the knowledge of harassment cases to perform the ultimate and unique act of voter accountability in a democracy: firing a misbehaving lawmaker.

In the Conyers case, the money was even more opaque, because rather than paying the woman out of the fund—where it would have at least appeared in aggregate numbers—it was paid out of his office budget, and effectively made her a no-show employee for three months, keeping her on payroll as a temporary staffer. (House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she was unaware of the settlement.) It’s impossible to know whether this practice is widespread or unique, but if the former, the Office of Compliance numbers in the Post might represent a dramatic undercount of the numbers of such claims that have been settled.

Finally, the Conyers case highlights the importance of the fear of reprisal. Politics, and Capitol Hill in particular, are all about connections; you can’t move up without happy bosses and good recommendations. Congress has no HR office, but complaints move through the Office of Compliance, which requires a confidential and lengthy process that includes counseling and mediation; moreover, many staffers don’t even know about it. The woman who filed the complaint against Conyers asked that her name be withheld, even though the settlement is over, because of fear of retribution. “I was basically blackballed. There was nowhere I could go,” she told BuzzFeed.

As a result, it’s rare for such cases to become public. The backstory of the article is intriguing on its own: BuzzFeed initially obtained the documents from Mike Cernovich, the pro-Trump blogger and prominent proponent of the bogus “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory. BuzzFeed verified the documents through other means. The unusual provenance in this case underscores how piecemeal and inconsistent the revelation of other congressional harassment scandals is likely to be.",mainstream

983,"SHREVEPORT, La. — A Louisiana man has pleaded guilty to telephoning a Washington, D.C., pizzeria in December and threatening to shoot those inside, authorities said Thursday.

The threats followed a shooting three days earlier at another D.C. pizza shop that was the target of a fake news story that went viral about a child sex ring.

According to U.S. Attorney Stephanie A. Finley, Yusif Lee Jones, 52, of Shreveport called the Besta Pizza shop in Washington on Dec. 7 and said he was trying to “save the kids” and threatened to “shoot everyone in the place,” according to testimony at the guilty plea.

An investigation by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department and the FBI traced the call to Jones in Shreveport. Jones admitted to making the threatening call and was arrested.

Jones pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge S. Maurice Hicks Jr. to one count of interstate threatening communications.

Jones faces up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release, restitution and a $250,000 fine. A sentencing date of April 12 was set.

The Louisiana arrest followed an incident in which a North Carolina man opened fire inside the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant in Washington while pursuing the fictitious online conspiracy.

Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, allegedly was reacting to a baseless conspiracy theory that the restaurant was a front for a child sex ring operated by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

199,"Tom DeLonge commented Friday on his unexpected appearance in a batch of leaked emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, where the former Blink-182 guitarist attempted to meet with Podesta in Washington, D.C. in order to discuss UFO matters.

“I am still here. Wikileaks really messed some important stuff up,” DeLonge wrote on Instagram Friday, nearly two weeks after his emails to Podesta leaked.

“What seems like ridiculous subject matter to most, is of massive importance to admirable National Security Leadership. It’s easy to poke fun about the topic from an armchair, but unless you’re invited to the meetings I have been a part of, then…no more laughing. Big things are coming. Project is still on, believe it or not, things just got bigger.”

The caption had a hashtag #SekretMachines, referring to DeLonge’s 704-page hardcover “based on actual events” novel, Sekret Machines Book 1: Chasing Shadows, the first installment in a planned trilogy that focuses on the subject of unidentified aerial phenomena.

In the Podesta emails, leaked by Wikileaks, DeLonge reached out to Clinton’s campaign chairman in an effort to set up a Washington, D.C. meeting between them and two people “in charge of most fragile divisions, as it relates to Classified Science and DOD topics. Other words, these are A-Level officials,” DeLonge wrote in October 2015.

One of the officials, a January 2016 email revealed, was General William McCasland, commander of the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, where pieces from the Roswell UFO crash were purportedly shipped. [“McCasland] not only knows what I’m trying to achieve, he helped assemble my advisory team,” DeLonge wrote to Podesta in a second email. “He’s a very important man.”

While another leaked email, a calendar notification, suggested that Podesta did schedule a time to meet with DeLonge and McCasland, it’s unclear whether the meeting actually took place.

Podesta, who also served as senior advisor to President Barack Obama, expressed disappointment in February 2015 that his time in the White House didn’t result in the revelation of the existence of UFOs. “Finally, my biggest failure of 2014: Once again not securing the #disclosure of the UFO files. #thetruthisstilloutthere,” Podesta tweeted.

However, in April, Podesta said that Hillary Clinton had promised him that she would declassify all documents pertaining to extraterrestrials if elected president.",mainstream
851,"Social media website Reddit Inc, known for its commitment to free speech, will crack down on online harassment by banning or suspending users who target others, starting with those who have directed abuse at Chief Executive Steve Huffman.

Huffman said in an interview with Reuters that Reddit's content policy prohibits harassment, but that it had not been adequately enforced.

""Personal message harassment is the most cut and dry,"" he said. ""Right now we are in an interesting position where my inbox is full of them, it's easy to start with me.""

As well as combing through Huffman's inbox, Reddit will monitor user reports, add greater filtering capacity, and take a more proactive role in policing its platform rather than relying on community moderators.

Reddit said it had identified hundreds of the ""most toxic users"" and will warn, ban or suspend them. It also plans to increase staff on its ""trust and safety"" team.

Reddit's moves are the latest step by social media companies to adjust their policies in the wake of a polarizing US election earlier this month in which their websites played a key role.

Facebook said it is reviewing its approach to so-called 'fake news' - generally sensational but fictitious reports designed to attract as many readers as possible - and banning some sites which host fake news from its advertising network. Twitter is also rolling out new tools to combat abuse.

On Reddit, a channel supporting the US Republican party's presidential candidate Donald Trump, called r/The_Donald, featured racist and misogynistic comments, fake news and conspiracy theories about his Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton, along with more mainstream expressions of support for Trump.

Many of those supporting Trump were very active, voting up the r/The_Donald conversations so that they became prominent across Reddit, which is the 7th-most-visited US internet site, according to web data firm Alexa.

Last week, Reddit banned Pizzagate, a community devoted to a conspiracy theory, with no evidence to back it up, that links Clinton to a paedophile ring at a Washington, D.C. pizza parlour, after it posted personal information in violation of Reddit policy.

Huffman then used his administrative privileges to redirect abuse he was receiving on a thread on r/The_Donald to the community's moderators - making it look as if it was intended for them. Huffman said it was a prank, and that many Reddit users, including some Trump supporters, told him they thought it was funny, but it inflamed the situation.

Reddit has a more permissive attitude than Facebook and Twitter when it comes to what it allows on its site, but r/The_Donald users frequently crossed a line, Huffman said, including by trying to manipulate voting to ensure their posts appear on prominent Reddit pages.

Reddit has stepped up its efforts to combat abuse on the site over the past year, creating what it called an 'anti-evil"" team of engineers dedicated to fighting harassment.

""The fact I was saying that combating harassment was important and then letting that openly happen to me, the CEO, there's a disconnect there,"" Huffman said.

In the past, Reddit has worked with moderators of communities to try to enforce its rules.

With r/The_Donald in particular, ""we haven't found that to be particularly effective. We might see flashes of success, but things kind of revert,"" Huffman said.

Under its new strategy, Reddit will take a more active role in dealing with troublemakers, who Huffman said were an ""infinitesimal"" portion of Reddit's 250 million monthly visitors.

He stressed that the move was not political.

""We don't want to be censoring political beliefs, but then they do misbehave,"" he said. ""That's why we have worked so closely with the r/The_Donald community. We tell them: don't force us to ban you.""

The first wave of bans will likely be skewed to the r/The_Donald community because ""that is a catalyst for a lot of this right now. That community is stirred up,"" Huffman said.

In a draft of a blog post to be published on Wednesday, Huffman said he had been asked by many Reddit users ""to ban r/The_Donald outright, but he had rejected that idea, because ""if there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.""",mainstream

911,"This is what a single tweet cost Roseanne Barr -- and everyone who worked with her

The ABC revival, which made $45 million in ad dollars this year, was expected to generate up to $60 million in its now-doomed 11th season

One racist tweet cost Roseanne Barr her network sitcom, hundreds of people their jobs, and ABC its top-rated primetime anchor for Tuesday nights.

Barr, who had previously promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and gone after a Parkland school shooting survivor on Twitter, incited new controversy Tuesday morning with tweets about Chelsea Clinton and billionaire philanthropist George Soros. But her tweet about former Barack Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, an African-American woman, generated the most backlash: “Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj,” Barr wrote and later deleted.

By that afternoon, ABC had canceled its highly watched revival of the ’90s hit “Roseanne,” which had earned favorable reviews. “Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show,” ABC president Channing Dungey said in a statement. “There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing,” added her boss, Disney CEO Bob Iger. Barr went on to apologize, blame her indiscretions on the sleep aid Ambien, and retweet supporters’ sympathetic messages.

“Obviously, ABC had a big hit on their hands,” TV industry analyst Alan Wolk told Moneyish. “She’s going to cost them a lot of revenue.”

Barr and co-star John Goodman, for starters, were each raking in a reported $250,000 per episode -- amounting to $2.25 million each for the first season and a hypothetical $3.25 million for the next, assuming the same per-episode rate. “In the short term, the cancellation of the show means that she’s not going to make all of the money that she was going to make this season, or anything on the back end,” Deana Myers, research director at Kagan, a media research group within S&P Global Market Intelligence, told Moneyish.

ABC’s move also cost the network plenty in potential ad revenue: The revival, which made $45 million in ad dollars this past season, was expected to generate up to $60 million in its now-doomed 11th season, per Kantar Media figures provided to The Wrap. Even cable networks suffer: “Roseanne” reruns spawned about $1.2 billion in ad revenue for cable networks and syndicators between 1995 and 2017, according to Kantar. That’s bad news for Viacom properties Paramount Networks, TV Land and CMT, which all yanked the show from their schedules, as well as the digital network Laff. (Hulu, which had streamed episodes of the revival, also dropped the show.)

And Barr herself, worth a reported $80 million, could be radioactive in at least the near future. Her talent agency, ICM, for example, announced Tuesday it would drop her as a client. “ICM is a top agency -- very powerful and very good at its job,” said Evan Smith, a professor in the television, radio and film department of Syracuse University’s Newhouse School. “To lose that as her front person finding work for her is a huge and damaging event for her, if she wants more work.” Employers likely aren’t lining up to hire her, he added, “at least for a while.”

Barr’s post-cancellation career outlook involves two major factors, Smith said. One is the standards people have for today’s celebrities: “A celebrity like Roseanne, you might think her career’s over -- but look at the time we live in,” Smith said, pointing to Mel Gibson’s successful showbiz rehabilitation years after his anti-Semitic rant. The other factor, he said, is whether Barr still possesses enough fresh appeal outside of her “Roseanne” role to justify putting her on a new TV series.

The 65-year-old creator-star is far from the only person affected by her tweets: More than 200 people worked on the show in various capacities, according to CNN.

“The show is a product, and the show is called ‘Roseanne.’ A central person who works for the show called ‘Roseanne’ is a woman named Roseanne Barr,” said Amanda Lotz, a media studies professor at the University of Michigan. “There’s been this conflation of this woman with the show, and that’s obvious and it’s natural, especially given its origins. But I think it’s important to keep in mind that the show was being written by many other people who are funny and not making racist tweets.”

Despite the tangible and projected losses, ABC’s business decision may have proved savvy in the long run. The network may have surmised that a potential boycott by people offended by racist comments presented a greater threat than a boycott by people supportive of Barr’s public messaging, Lotz said. And ABC parent Disney, in the midst of a proposed asset sale with 21st Century Fox, likely has shareholders in mind, experts said. “So a second benefit … to ABC jumping forward to say, ‘No, no, not acceptable,’ is that it affirms to the public that the network and its parent company have standards -- and maintain standards, even when that comes at a hefty cost,” Smith said.

The “Roseanne” revival was “bound to be a moneymaker” that could’ve run several years, Smith said -- but despite its instant-hit status, he added, there are plenty of other shows in today’s saturated television landscape that can step up and take its place. And “it’s not like those commercial minutes are now going to be dead airtime,” Smith pointed out. “A different show will take that spot; airtime will be sold. It may be sold for less; it may be sold for more,” he said. “Sponsorship revenues are not lost -- they might just change.”

Still, there’s a sadness to the show’s cancellation, he said. “The original show did such a good job of promoting some important issues, like feminism and gay rights … (And the new series) was in a great position to tackle today’s important issues, arguing both liberal and conservative viewpoints,” Smith said. “But now that opportunity is gone. It was shot down by a tweet.”

MILWAUKEE (AP) — President Donald Trump was more than halfway through his speech at a rally in Milwaukee when one of his hand gestures caught the eye of a supporter standing in the packed arena.

The 51-year-old woman believed the president had traced the shape of the letter “Q” with his fingers as a covert signal to followers of QAnon, a right-wing, pro-Trump conspiracy theory. She turned to the couple on her right and excitedly asked, “Did you see the ‘Q’?”

“He just did it?” asked Diane Jacobson, 63, of Racine, Wisconsin.

“I think it was,” replied their new friend, Chrisy. The Geneva, Illinois, resident declined to give her last name in part because she said she wanted to avoid negative “attention.”

The Jacobsons met Chrisy and her husband, Paul, hours earlier in the line to get into the Jan 14 rally. The couples bonded over their shared interest in QAnon, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the “deep state” and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals.

What started as an online obsession for the far-right fringe has grown beyond its origins in a dark corner of the internet. QAnon has been creeping into the mainstream political arena for more than a year. The trend shows no sign of abating as Trump fires up his reelection campaign operation, attracting a loyal audience of conspiracy theorists and other fringe groups to his raucous rallies.

Trump has retweeted QAnon-promoting accounts. Followers flock to Trump’s rallies wearing clothes and hats with QAnon symbols and slogans. At least 23 current or former congressional candidates in the 2020 election cycle have endorsed or promoted QAnon, according to the liberal watchdog Media Matters for America, which compiled online evidence to support its running tally.

Conspiracy theorists aren’t the only fringe characters drawn to Trump rallies. The Oath Keepers, an anti-government group formed in 2009 after President Barack Obama’s election, has been sending “security volunteers” to escort Trump supporters at rallies across the country.

University of California, Davis history professor Kathryn Olmsted, author of a book called “Real Enemies: Conspiracy Theories and American Democracy, World War I to 9/11,” said it’s unclear whether QAnon has attracted more believers than other conspiracy theories that have intersected with U.S. politics.

“What’s different now is that there are people in power who are spreading this conspiracy theory,” she said, adding that Trump’s conspiracy-minded rhetoric seems to fire up part of his base. “Finally, there is someone saying they’re not crazy.”

Conspiracy theories are nothing new, but experts fear the powerful engine of social media and a volatile political climate have ramped up the threat of violence. An FBI bulletin in May warned that conspiracy theory-driven extremists have become a domestic terrorism threat. The bulletin specifically mentions QAnon.

A Trump campaign spokeswoman and a White House spokesman didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. Asked about QAnon in 2018, then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump “condemns and denounces any group that would incite violence against another individual.” Some major Trump supporters, including former White House aide Sebastian Gorka, have denounced QAnon.

For more than two years, followers have pored over a tangled set of clues purportedly posted online by a high-ranking government official known only as “Q.” Many followers believe the late John F. Kennedy Jr. is a Trump supporter who faked his death in a 1999 plane crash. Another core belief is that thousands of deep state operatives and top Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and Obama, will be rounded up and sent to Guantanamo Bay during an event called “The Storm.”

The first Q “drop” appeared on the 4chan imageboard in October 2017. The messages migrated to 8chan until a string of mass shootings by gunmen who posted manifestos on the site led to it getting forced offline in August. The disruption, which ended when the imageboard relaunched in November under the new name 8kun, hardly spelled the end of QAnon.

Travis View, a conspiracy theory researcher who co-hosts The QAnon Anonymous Podcast and has written about QAnon for the Washington Post under his pseudonym, said the sense of community forged by QAnon believers has helped it endure beyond the life span of other conspiracy theories.

“People in the QAnon community feel like they are banding together to uncover the real truth behind the scenes,” said View, who works as a marketer for a San Diego company and says he uses the pseudonym to protect himself. His acerbic comments about what he calls an “apocalyptic political cult” have earned him more than 20,000 followers on Twitter and vitriol from QAnon believers.

Before Trump’s rally in Milwaukee, thousands waited in line for hours to enter the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena. Some wore apparel adorned with a “Q” or “WWG1WGA,” which stands for the QAnon slogan, “Where we go one, we go all.”

The frigid, gloomy weather didn’t dampen the spirits of QAnon follower Donna Shank, 50, of Burlington, Wisconsin. Shank, who said she voted for Obama in 2008, was ambivalent about politics before she stumbled across QAnon online and joined Facebook groups to learn more.

“I just woke up,” she said. “I was a sheep. I followed anything and everything.”

Diane Jacobson attached a pink “Q” and a blue “Q” to the back of her black “Make America Great Again” hat. She and her husband were eager to attend their first Trump rally.

“Trump is trying to tell us, to the best he can without compromising intelligence, what’s really going on,” she said.

Jacobson knows many people, including some of her relatives, scoff at QAnon.

“You really can’t argue with them,” she said.

Jacobson celebrated with her new friend, Chrisy, when the doors to the downtown arena opened.

“All these people believe me! I’m not crazy here!” Chrisy shouted.

Hours later, during Trump’s speech, Chrisy’s husband, Paul, grinned when the president said “the whole world is watching” what’s happening with protesters in Iran.

“That’s a Q reference,” Paul said, noting the phrase “the world is watching” has appeared several times in Q drops.

The May 30 bulletin sent by the FBI’s Phoenix field office warned of conspiracy theories inspiring violence by groups and “individual extremists,” according to an October court filing for a QAnon-related criminal investigation in Colorado. Police in the Denver suburb of Parker said Cynthia Abcug was accused of conspiring with QAnon supporters to kidnap her son from foster care. Abcug was arrested in Montana on Dec. 30 and awaits extradition to Colorado.

Internet-fueled conspiracies already have been linked to acts of real-world violence. A man charged with killing the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family last March showed off a QAnon symbol scrawled on his left hand during a court appearance. In 2017, a North Carolina man was sentenced to prison for firing a rifle in a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant at the center of the debunked “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that high-profile Democrats run a child sex trafficking ring out of the restaurant’s (nonexistent) basement.

Pizzagate and other far-right conspiracy theories have faded, but experts see no end in sight to QAnon’s popularity.

Nancy Rosenblum, a Harvard University professor emeritus of ethics in politics and government, said the apocalyptic nature of the QAnon narrative resonates with those who want to believe that their political enemies will be vanquished and a better future will rise from the ashes.

“What makes it unique is that Trump is the chosen one,” said Rosenblum, co-author of the book “A Lot of People Are Saying: The New Conspiracism and the Assault on Democracy.”

172,"“False flag” allegations in the aftermath of mass shootings have become something of an Alex Jones franchise. His conspiracy theories about the massacres at Tucson, Arizona; Aurora, Colorado; and Newtown, Connecticut were broadcast on terrestrial radio, streamed on Jones’ website, and, most importantly from an audience standpoint, chopped into bits for chumming views on YouTube. Last week, following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, a YouTube clip on Jones’ channel, which suggested the student protesters from Marjory Stoneman Douglas were carpet-bagging “crisis actors,” became the top trending video on the site. But this time, YouTube did something different: It sanctioned Jones’ channel with a “strike” for violating the site’s community content standards. A few days later, a video titled, “David Hogg Can’t Remember His Lines In TV Interview” – which similarly questioned the authenticity of the 17-year-old student activist – earned Jones’ channel a second strike. According to the company’s policy, one more strike within the next three months and Jones’ channel would be permanently banned from the streaming service.

For a decade, Jones’ YouTube channel has been the engine behind Infowars, his Austin-based peddler of rightwing news, batshit-populism, conspiracy analysis and dubious nutritional supplements. The channel’s value has less to do with its long subscriber list – currently at 2.2 million – than as a vortex for sucking in a steady stream of newbies. Thanks to YouTube’s carefully designed algorithms, Jones was a regular in “recommended” and “up next” lists, transfixing online souls with red-faced rants about the New World Order, feminizing juice boxes and DMT elves. When I interviewed Jones two years ago at the Republican National Convention, he twice mentioned the YouTube milestone coming into view. “We’re going to hit a billion views soon,” he said. “We’re reaching more people every day.”

Jones has responded to YouTube’s threats with a mix of bravado, victimhood and panic. The strikes, he said, are part of a “CNN lobbying campaign.” He’s launched a fundraising marathon, issued familiar denunciations of his would-be globalist censors and announced a series of legal actions “to defend the First Amendment.” But Jones knows as well as anyone that YouTube’s actions have nothing to do with his “revolution.” Just like Infowars, Google-owned YouTube is a company dedicated to making money; and for a long time the two worked in peaceful symbiosis to help each other make an awful lot of it.

For years, YouTube profited off all kinds of extremist content; its three-strike policy was directed at copyright infringement. Its current and newly aggressive posture towards content stems from the advertiser revolt that erupted following Trump’s surprise victory. Within weeks of the 2016 election, brands like Johnson & Johnson, and ad-tech companies like AppNexus, began taking steps to distance themselves from Breitbart and other purveyors of “fake news” and extremist content. In early 2017, companies like Starbucks and Walmart started pulling their ads from YouTube, worried that their marketing was sandwiched between clips featuring foaming-at-the-mouth racists and child abusers. In a watershed moment, the global buying agency Havas pulled its ads from Google/YouTube U.K., after the Times of London detailed how ads for well-known charities were supporting Neo-Nazi articles and videos. When the influential research group Pivotal downgraded Google stock from a buy to a hold, Google suddenly grew concerned about the kind of content its proprietary algorithms had been promoting for years – intentionally and by design.

This is not a conspiracy theory worthy of a “strike,” but the testimony of a former YouTube engineer named Guillaume Chaslot, who was profiled by the Guardian in early February. Chaslot, a Ph.D. in artificial intelligence, explained how his team at YouTube was tasked with designing algorithms that prioritized “watch time” alone. “Watch time was the priority,” he told the paper. “Everything else was considered a distraction… There are many ways YouTube can change its algorithms to suppress fake news and improve the quality and diversity of videos people see… I tried to change YouTube from the inside, but it didn’t work.”

When Chaslot conducted an independent study of how his algorithms worked in the real world, he found that during recent elections in France, Germany and the U.K., YouTube “systematically amplifie[d] videos that are divisive, sensational and conspiratorial.” (His findings can be seen at Algotransparency.org.) At the height of the advertising revolt, in March of last year, YouTube announced that it was “taking a hard look at our existing community guidelines to determine what content is allowed on the platform – not just what content can be monetized.” CEO Susan Wojcicki announced the company would hire thousands of human moderators to watch and judge all content on the site.

YouTube’s new policies were part of an industry-wide course correction. Over the past year, under the banner of combatting hate speech and fake news, Google and Facebook began to cut off search traffic and monetized content-creator accounts, not only to dangerous scam-artists like Jones, but to any site that garnered complaints or didn’t meet newly enforced enforced and vaguely defined criteria of “credible” and “quality.”

A number of left-leaning sites of substance, including AlterNet.org and Truthout.org, along with mainstream human rights groups like Amnesty International, were affected. Although “conspiracies,” like allegations of CIA drug trafficking, tend to be better sourced than “Pizzagate,” the algorithm didn’t seem to make a distinction. As a result, these sites saw their traffic fall off a cliff. “Many of the largest progressive news organizations watched their online audiences from Google and Facebook decline as much as 60 percent in 2017,” says Jan Frel, associate publisher of AlterNet.org. “And they’re still falling.”

Jones” many critics might keep this in mind as they indulge in some easy schadenfreude. Beneath all the noise, an Internet designed to calm and please advertisers is quietly kneecapping small and independent news sites. It is being sold under the guise of fighting “fake news” and Russian disinformation, and any focus on Alex Jones conveniently deflects attention from the larger implications of this shift. As loathsome and dangerous as Jones’ schtick has become, it would be a mistake to think of his newly “public-minded” enemies in Big Tech as benevolent protectors.

Which isn’t to say anyone should weep for Alex Jones, either, or come to his defense. He’s guilty as charged, and he’ll absorb the loss of his YouTube channel by selling right-wing rage and virility pills on terrestrial radio and the Infowars website. Given Jones’ record of being ahead of the technology curve, he might even find a new outlet for influence that the rest of us have yet to figure out.",mainstream

125,"Fake news. It is not innocuous. It is downright dangerous. On Sunday, a man armed with an assault-style rifle walked into a pizza shop in Washington, D.C. He allegedly wanted to “self-investigate” a conspiracy theory relating to Hillary Clinton and a child sex ring. The story was completely fake, but the assault weapon was not.

According to The Washington Post, one or more shots were fired by Edgar Maddison Welch, a 28-year-old man from Salisbury, N.C. No one was injured, but the immediate area went on lockdown all because of fake Internet and social media stories about “pizzagate.” Welch was believed to be looking for hidden underground tunnels inside the store. Claims that Clinton and her campaign chief were running a child sex ring inside Comet Ping Pong, the D.C. pizza joint, were entirely bogus. But once these lies were given life in the digital petri dish that has become America, there has been no stopping the story – or others equally bizarre.

As The Washington Post also reported Monday, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, who is advising President-elect Donald Trump on national security, shared another anti-Clinton fake news story – that one involved pedophilia.

The digital age is proving much like the dawn of the atomic age – a blessing and curse. The technology that allows individuals anywhere in the world to reach potentially millions of strangers is an extraordinary achievement. The Arab Spring movement was fueled by social media. But the dangers of instant, widespread communication are obvious. When individuals use technology to spew falsehoods to gain a political advantage, the collateral damage is wide and indiscriminate.

James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, told The Washington Post, “What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences.”

During the nasty 2016 presidential campaign that was all too obvious. Then Republican candidate Trump suggested that U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz’s father was somehow tied into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Trump’s explanation was that he had heard others say it, never saying he knew it to be true. But the saying of it was all that mattered.

A Google search for “fake news sites” pulled up 10.5 million results. This is becoming an epidemic of sorts because too many readers are not checking where their news is originating. There is much talk about bias in the mainstream media. While there are opinions on editorial pages, like this one, the opinions are marked as such. And they are not made out of whole cloth.

There is a difference between an opinion based on facts and a complete fabrication. What happened Sunday is probably just the beginning – in a country where access to weapons is easy, social media are prevalent and divisiveness is on the rise, a bad outcome is inevitable. D.C. police said Welch was armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle. Additionally, a handgun and a shotgun were seized.

Matt Carr, the owner of a shop near the targeted pizza store, told The Washington Post his business, as well as others, have been receiving constant threats.

He said, “This was our worst fear – that someone would read all this and come to the block with a gun. And today it happened.”

People were lucky Sunday. No one was hurt.

1043,"Late on Sunday, after returning to his hotel room on a trip away from home, Mark Zuckerberg made a decision he had hoped to avoid.

For weeks, the Facebook chief executive and his colleagues had debated what to do about Infowars, the notorious far-right news site, and Alex Jones, Infowars' choleric founder, who became famous for his spittle-flecked rants and far-fetched conspiracies, including the idea that the Sandy Hook massacre was an elaborate hoax promoted by gun-control supporters.

Mr. Jones is just one Facebook user out of 2.2 billion, but he had become symbolic of tech platforms' inconsistency and reluctance to engage in a misinformation war.

The pressure on Facebook to do something about him had intensified after executives gave a series of vague and confusing answers to lawmakers and reporters about the company's policies. Misinformation was allowed to stay on the platform, they said, but hate speech wasn't. So users dug up and reported old Infowars posts, asking for their removal on the grounds that they glorified violence and contained dehumanizing language against Muslims, immigrants, and transgender people.

These posts clearly violated Facebook's hate speech rules. And in a normal situation, a low-level content moderator might have reviewed them, found that they qualified, and taken them down.

But Mr. Jones was no typical internet crank. He has millions of followers, a popular video show, and the ear of President Trump — who once told the provocateur that his reputation was ""amazing."" Banning such a prominent activist would lead to political blowback, no matter how justified the action was.

The situation was volatile enough that Mr. Zuckerberg got personally engaged, according to two people involved in Facebook's handling of the accounts. He discussed Infowars at length with other executives, and mused privately about whether Mr. Jones — who once called Mr. Zuckerberg a ""genetic-engineered psychopath"" in a video — was purposefully trying to get kicked off the platform to gain attention, they said.

Mr. Zuckerberg, an engineer by training and temperament, has always preferred narrow process decisions to broad, subjective judgments. His evaluation of Infowars took the form of a series of technical policy questions. They included whether the mass-reporting of Infowars posts constituted coordinated ""brigading,"" a tactic common in online harassment campaigns. Executives also debated whether Mr. Jones should receive a ""strike"" for each post containing hate speech (which would lead to removing his pages as well as the individual posts) or a single, collective strike (which would remove the posts, but leave his pages up).

Late Sunday, Apple — which has often tried to stake out moral high ground on contentious debates — removed Infowars podcasts from iTunes. After seeing the news, Mr. Zuckerberg sent a note to his team confirming his own decision: the strikes against Infowars and Mr. Jones would count individually, and the pages would come down. The announcement arrived at 3 a.m. Pacific time.

More from The New York Times:

Tech Companies Banned Infowars. Now, Its App Is Trending.

In the days that followed, other platforms — YouTube, Pinterest, MailChimp, and more — said they, too, were banning Infowars. The notable exception was Twitter, which decided not to ban the site or Mr. Jones. The company's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, tweeted a veiled shot at the way his rivals handled the situation.

""We're going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories,"" he said.

Now, cut off from most of his audience, Mr. Jones will have to chart a new course. He has already stepped enthusiastically into a role as a free-speech martyr. (After the ban took effect, Infowars slapped a ""censored"" label on its videos and launched a ""forbidden information"" marketing campaign.) And conservatives — and even some free-speech advocates on the left — worried that social media companies may be entering a new, censorious era. Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican from Texas, paraphrased the famous Martin Niemöller poem about German accommodation of Nazism: ""First, they came for Alex Jones.""

Social media executives have a history of going to great lengths to assuage fears of anti-conservative bias, and this week was no exception. On Thursday, Richard Allan, a Facebook vice president of policy, published a blog post about the company's commitment to free speech. With the exception of violent threats and hate speech, he wrote, ""we lean toward free expression. It's core to both who we are and why we exist."" Mr. Dorsey also appeared on Sean Hannity's radio show, where he gave reassurances that Twitter does not discriminate against conservatives.

Slippery-slope fears about mass censorship by social media platforms are probably overblown. For starters, Infowars presented an unusual case because of its size, the extreme nature of its content and the ferocity of Mr. Jones's critics. Mr. Zuckerberg does not have time to adjudicate every dispute over hate speech on Facebook, nor does he want to.

In fact, taking action against Infowars could allow social media giants to avoid future conflicts over extreme content by setting a new, hard-to-beat standard for unacceptable toxicity. (""Yes, Jewhater McRacist is bad,"" they may say, ""but he's no Alex Jones."") Many other internet conspiracists have learned how to tiptoe to the edge of platforms' rules without breaking them — speaking in code about Pizzagate, for example, or saying things like ""I'm not saying he's a crisis actor, but if he were …""

One lesson Mr. Zuckerberg has taken from the Infowars saga, said the people involved in the handling of Mr. Jones's Facebook accounts, is that the social network's policies are overly complex and need to be simplified. Privately, company officials have also downplayed the Infowars bans, saying they don't represent a watershed moment in the online free speech debate, but are rather a matter of how to enforce Facebook's existing policies.

This is a convenient narrative, of course, from a company that would rather haggle over terms of service than discuss the power and governance of its platform.

There are legitimate questions, still unanswered, about what to do about the huge, unaccountable corporations that control large pieces of our modern communications infrastructure. Both fans and critics of Infowars can probably agree that a system in which one executive can decide to shut off a news organization's access to a large portion of its audience is hardly ideal.

There are also valid questions about why Infowars got so popular in the first place, and whether attention-maximizing platforms like Facebook and YouTube are designed in way so that people like Mr. Jones are incentivized to push the boundaries of acceptable speech.

After all, these platforms didn't just host Infowars content for those who were seeking it — they actively promoted it to millions of people for years, through algorithmic feeds and recommendation engines that decide which videos to show you next. Could these platforms be redesigned so that the next Alex Jones never gets that kind of boost, and remains on the ideological fringes?

These questions will have to wait. For now, tech leaders seem satisfied to have dealt with their Infowars problems, at least temporarily. They will return to their defensive crouch, hiding their power behind policies, making small changes under pressure, and hoping that nobody notices the size of their footprints.",mainstream

The Podesta Group reportedly worked with Manafort -- a former chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign -- to lobby on behalf of Ukrainian interests in the United States, without properly registering at the time under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), Carlson said.

Manafort and the group worked on a campaign called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, the Washington Times reported.

""In other words, for a near identical crime, Bill and Hillary's friend could escape and emerge completely unscathed while Paul Manafort may rot in jail,"" Carlson said.

Podesta did not register as a foreign agent under FARA, Carlson said in a segment last October.

Mueller is also offering immunity to five potential witnesses in the upcoming trial of Manafort, the Washington Examiner reported.

Mueller's team is requesting ""use immunity,"" which is a limited type of immunity, the publication reported, citing court documents filed Tuesday.

The five people have not been charged or identified publicly with the case, prosecutors for Mueller’s team said, according to the Examiner.

Tony Podesta resigned from his lobbying group in October in response to Mueller’s investigation of the firm, the report said.

The firm was reportedly closed by the end of last year.

The special counsel’s office did not immediately respond for comment.

Manafort is accused of multiple financial crimes in connection with lobbying work he performed in Ukraine.

The first of his two upcoming trials, in Virginia, is scheduled to begin next week.",conspiracy
658,"Two years ago, a low-level comedian in Scotland who goes by Count Dankula on YouTube taught his girlfriend’s pug Buddha to raise its paw in a Nazi salute. After the video went viral, Count Dankula -- whose real name is Mark Meechan -- was arrested, the dog’s tricks deemed a “hate crime” by the state. At his sentencing last week, the judge ordered Meechan to pay a fine equaling $1100 USD for being “grossly offensive.” The fine has spawned a protest in the UK, more than $150,000 in donations, a significantly increased profile for Meechan, accusations on all sides of authoritarianism and enough online rage to power all of NYC for three days if it were ever converted into energy.

The Nazi pug, by itself an absurd and inherently laughable concept (a grossly mutated and furry baby Hitler anyone?), has created a mess of a controversy that perfectly reflects all the darkest aspects of a digitally connected society. Trying to have a reasonable discussion about Meechan’s antics and his sentencing might just be a fool’s errand. Here goes an attempt:

First, the law by which Meechan was found to be “grossly offensive” in Scotland under, the Communications Act of 2003, is vague enough to be easily abused should a state be so inclined: “Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 makes it an offence to use a public communications network to send certain types of messages including those that are grossly offensive or threatening.”

If such a law were in the United States, every person voicing any political opinion or offensive joke on Twitter, YouTube or Facebook could be found guilty under it, including current US president Donald Trump. Further, what constitutes as “grossly offensive” is highly subjective, something even Sheriff Derek O'Carroll mentioned in his sentencing. However, the hand-wringing from the right over Meechan’s verdict as an example of a PC police state running amok is obnoxious and false as Meechan was only threatened with jail time, he wasn’t actually imprisoned for his video, remember.

Second, when it comes to understanding digital culture, a generational gap has revealed itself here. (And yes, that gap has been further exacerbated by the content creator in question who seems happy to stick it to the elderly while at the same time denying any responsibility-- more on that further down)

Edgelord humor -- the idea of being offensive just for offense’s sake -- in general doesn’t translate well to non-Millennials, historically oppressed minorities and people not steeped in Internet culture. While young men and women have grown up near this environment, most over 35 have not. Edgelord humor (also known as “shitposting,” what Meechan describes his online behavior as) lives in the darker places of 4chan, reddit, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other platforms like Discord and Steam. Edgelord humor mainly relies on language and concepts deemed taboo by mainstream society and in general, these jokes punch down. Because of these two factors, any edgy joke can easily be viewed as hate speech when taken out of context (see any and all of PewDiePie’s mainstream media scandals for examples).

Anyone not familiar with this concept, like the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities (SCoJeC), will of course be alarmed and feel threatened by such language, but it explains why Meechan kept using offensive phrases like “Seig Heil” and “gas the Jews” in the video. Training a dog to react to vocal commands takes repetition, and besides the Edgelord factor, Meechan perhaps did not edit out all of his offensive training words to show how labor intensive this prank against his girlfriend was. (Another issue the court had -- as if the amount of time it took to pull off a joke could somehow prove whether or not it was a hate crime.)

Meechan’s trial was very much about edgelordism, and as made apparent by the ruling, Meechan failed to convince the judge the threat was not real.

Other indicators of a technological knowledge gap include the court’s reasoning that because Meechan’s then-girlfriend apparently wasn’t subscribed to his channel, it couldn’t have been intended for her. Meechan’s girlfriend most definitely saw the video and its massive popularity only further enhanced her mortification. (She more or less said this -- the joke was made “at my expense” -- in a Count Dankula apology video.)

Third, a major argument used against Meechan is that the language in his video normalizes hate speech against the Jewish people. Both the representative for the SCoJeC and Sheriff Derek O'Carroll used this argument and it would be a whole lot stronger if Meechan never actually faced any consequences for his actions, which is not the case. He’s been more or less paying for it since 2016: Meechan made an apology video of his own volition, the original Nazi Pug video was heavily restricted by YouTube, he was arrested, he’s lost employment because of the video, he’s been branded a criminal by his government and faced legal consequences over a two-year span that included the threat of jail time. None of that normalizes his language, is “normal” for a video marked “Comedy.” The blowback is a deterrent for similar content in the future. (Which might have been the whole purpose of the trial to begin with.)

Fourth, asking that the Nazi Pug video be viewed in context goes both ways. Just like how Meechan is not an anomaly with his edgelordness, the court and Jewish community of Scotland is not operating in a vacuum. It is an undeniable fact that nationalist hate groups around the world are seeing a resurgence, both in members and political influence. Scotland has seen a steady increase in anti-semitic hate crimes, the most in 2016-2017, more than in 2015, which was more than previous years. In the entirety of UK, anti-semitic hate crimes are also at “record high” and that includes violent assaults. These facts may not be on Meechan’s mind, but both the court and SCoJeC are well aware of them, and is the “context” Sheriff Derek O'Carroll meant when he handed down his sentencing. Also the part about how “the right to freedom of expression also comes with responsibility.”

Fifth, while it’s clear from his entire content library that Count Dankula is not actually a neo-Nazi, his online behavior and associations since the start of the controversy indicate he would be an incredibly easy mark for indoctrination into said groups. He claims on Twitter to not being able to stand extremists of any political affiliation and yet he pals with extremists on the right and sends harassing tweets to anyone on the left criticizing him. A recent tweet randomly criticizing London’s first Muslim mayor by characterizing the new online hate crime division as simply policing people for “mean tweets” does him no favors in the eyes of the prosecution and the left, “shitposter” or not.

Refusing to answer questions from credited newspapers but granting interviews to fake news fearmonger Alex Jones (infamously known in the YouTube community for believing Obama turns frogs gay with chemtrails) indicates a tolerance for outlandish conspiracy theories as well.

Sure, Meechan is not promoting content from sites like Stormfront or the Scottish Dawn and even debates an alleged white supremacy over his abhorrent views on trans rights (which Meechan is for) on his channel, he has continued to cozy up to people categorized as the far-right and the “alt-right.” The aforementioned groups like abusing their “free speech” banners to harass minorities and stoke fear and violence through fake facts and outlandish conspiracies like Pizzagate, Seth Reich and how Parkland HS shooting survivors are really crisis actors, for starters.

Further, Meechan has made absolutely no effort to reconcile with the Jewish community or the frightened grandpas -- both the judge and the SCoJeC representative-- that have gotten death threats in his wake (and I use “grandpa” here in the most respectful way possible). The money Meechan raised is for legal fees for his appeal, and the charity drive Meechan started on Twitter is for a children’s hospital. None of those drives were remotely reconciliatory in tone, the latter more of a haughty “if I was a fascist I wouldn’t be donating to kids” kind of giving.

Denying that there were no victims in this Nazi Pug controversy is something the right likes to do, and perhaps where Meechan is taking all his cues. The National Review ran with the particularly egregious headline of “The Persecution of Count Dankula” and makes no mention of the SCoJec nor its representative who spoke at the trial and whose parents were actually persecuted under Germany’s Nazi regime. Having to pay a fine of roughly a grand is hardly comparable. The Quillette, a more reasonable right-leaning publication out of Australia, also alleged “there wasn’t a victim at all.” Their article sneered at the idea of anyone considering the video “hate speech” and dismissed the concerns of the Jewish community in Scotland, at one point implying SCoJec brought an online hate mob on themselves simply by speaking during Meechan’s trial. (At the same time the post championed “free speech,” it also seemed to criticize London police for not restricting the rights of a man waving an ISIL flag.)

If Meechan were serious about clearing his name in the court of public opinion that is social media and proving he was not an anti-semitic threat, he would reach out to Jewish groups in Scotland and seek to make amends. These amends could involve community service or a charity drive for various causes, or even to increase security at their synagogues. (Maybe Meechan, with his intimidating physique, can provide security for them!) Anything other than what he is currently doing, of more “shitposting” online.

May 2nd edit: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated the original Nazi Pug video was deleted but it in fact has been heavily restricted (no comments, ads, search accessibility).

The previous version also erroneously called Meechan a Trump fan. After an hour-long discussion over Skype, Meechan explained that is not the case and he only references the US President and shares Trump memes as much as he does as part of his Edgelord schtick. This is also why he spoke on InfoWars -- Alex Jones “is a meme” -- and while Meechan jokes about various conspiracies Jones’ peddles, he doesn’t actually believe in any of them.

To that point, Meechan admitted “there’s a huge discussion in our circles right now” about the notion of “who means and who memes.” To explain it in the context of this post, how popular Internet memes have been co-opted by hate groups and the mainstream and it is becoming increasingly difficult to tell who is being ironic and who actually means it.

Meechan also wanted it to be known he expressed willingness to meet and reconcile with SCoJeC to make amends “but it was actually Social Work themselves who said ‘no, do not contact them, do not speak to them in any way’ … if I try to contact them in any way I could end up getting arrested.” Meechan is open to reaching out to other Jewish organizations in the UK or donating in the future.",mainstream
946,"Editorial: Just reading headlines can be misleading

Last week, staff from Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki’s office altered a Delawareonline headline about his budget proposal on the city Facebook page. The changed headline offered a more “positive tone” about a sensitive subject: Taxpayer money.

The headline that originally read “Purzycki proposes tax hike, staffing cuts in Wilmington” turned into “Mayor Purzycki’s Cost-Saving Measures.""

According to a News Journal article on the situation, an administration staff member took advantage of a Facebook tool available only to those who manage professional or group pages. The post violated the social network's policy against “anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.""

The post was deleted within hours, and according to the mayor’s office, neither the mayor nor senior staff knew that a junior staff member had manipulated the headline.

Apologies were made, and the supposed proper disciplinary actions were executed.

But no matter how you look at last week’s situation, there’s an underlying theme there that’s bigger than a headline about a proposed budget cut.

Somewhere along the line, the public began to consume “Fake News."" “Alternative Facts” became a nice and a quaint way to call something a lie – or someone a liar – without actually saying it.

Last December, a man fired an assault rifle inside of a pizza parlor in Washington because he read online that the restaurant was harboring young children as sex slaves as part of a child-abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton.

“Pizzagate: How 4Chan Uncovered the Sick World of Washington’s Occult Elite.”

Then there was the story about how a recent college graduate created a fake news story about an electrical worker who stumbled on some boxes of ballots that were pre-marked for Clinton.

“BREAKING: ‘Tens of thousands’ of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse.”

Both stories were untrue, but they both caused damage. And while these two instances carry a heavier burden of importance than a finagled headline about a proposed city budget, the intent of misleading readers is at the core.

However, part of this burden also weighs on readers.

Headlines are meant to pull you into a story. Once there, you have to read the actual story to glean the news from it.

Unfortunately, we now live in an era in which double checking headlines and news sources for validity is rare. We all have a responsibility to change that. The next time you read something that seems too far right or too far left to be true, double check it.
• Google the name of the writer. A journalist’s prior stories will always come up in a search.
• Research the website that hosts the article in question. Does it come from a trusted news website, or does it have a blog address?
• Search for the story on other social media platforms. Just because you see an article shared on Facebook, doesn’t mean its legitimacy isn't being questioned on Twitter.

It's easy to get caught by a flashy headline while scrolling on your phone or around social media in general.

But take a few precious seconds to understand and verify what you're reading before you hit that ""share"" or ""retweet"" button.",mainstream

• The mysterious figure called ""Q"" or ""QAnon"" first appeared on 4chan, claiming that they had inside information about a secret plot being hatched by the Trump administration.
• According to Q, the forces of righteousness were about to pounce on the ""deep state,"" an entrenched conspiracy that supposedly also encompassed a vast array of well-known liberals.
• When Q's predictions that Trump would declare ""a state of temporary military control"" did not play out, Q's followers continued to believe its apocalyptic prophecies.
• Some QAnon supporters even believe that Q is Trump — the president and the prophet combined.

The mysterious figure called ""Q"" or ""QAnon"" first appeared online on October 28, 2017, with a post on the far-right /pol/ message board of 4chan that they had inside information about a secret plot being hatched by the Trump administration.

According to Q, the forces of righteousness were about to pounce on the ""deep state,"" an entrenched conspiracy that supposedly also encompassed a vast array of well-known liberal names, including Hillary and Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, John Podesta, and George Soros.

They were said to be engaged not only in attempting to foil President Donald Trump's policies but also in operating a global pedophilia ring that would dwarf Pizzagate. Q's post might have disappeared among thousands of other obscure messages had it not been picked up and promoted by two of the website's moderators and a YouTube video producer who together brought it to a larger audience of conspiracy buffs and wider web platforms.

As Q continued to post, they made a series of dramatic predictions: Trump would deliver a coup against the deep state during which no fewer than 25,000 sealed indictments would be opened.

In a message on November 1, 2017, Q alerted followers that the opening of these indictments would cause widespread civil disorder. Therefore, because of the riots caused by the imminent arrest of ""senior public officials,"" the president was about to declare ""a state of temporary military control"" within ""the next several days.""

The problem with Q's predictions was not only the specificity of the events themselves but that they were dated, suggesting a series of extraordinary developments within the first few days of November.

Of course, nothing of the sort actually happened, although Q continued to post up until October 2018. That has left the QAnon movement with a classic dilemma of apocalyptic movements: What do you do when prophecy fails?

DON'T MISS: 3 things Jeff Sessions did as attorney general that history will remember

It might seem strange to call an online conspiracy theory an apocalyptic movement. But at the heart of such beliefs, from those who expected the Second Coming in 19th-century America to their counterparts in the Taiping Rebellion across the Pacific, is the idea of revelation.

Believers are offered some special insight into the future and the knowledge that a great change is coming. That's part of what made QAnon so appealing — and left them reaching for the same toolbox that millenarians do when the apocalypse is delayed.

That has left the Q believers with a dilemma. We don't know just how many of them there are, although they've begun to turn out at Trump rallies wearing Q T-shirts. But this is a subculture, not a formal organization, so their numbers are unknown.

However many there are, those attracted to Q's pronouncements have found themselves facing the same problem that has confronted others dealing with failed prophecies and predictions: cognitive dissonance.

A man wear a shirt with the words Q Anon as he attends a rally for President Donald Trump at the Make America Great Again Rally being held in the Florida State Fair Grounds Expo Hall on July 31, 2018 in Tampa, Florida. Some people attending either wore shirts with a Q or held signs with a Q and are reported to be part of a conspiracy theory group. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Cognitive dissonance occurs when individuals are pulled in opposite directions by their beliefs on the one hand and their real-world experience on the other. The conflict between them creates psychological pressure, which people seek to reduce.

This situation has been faced many times before, by people who have made huge personal investments in belief systems that claimed some great change would take place at a given time but who were then left psychologically stranded when the change did not take place. This happened, for example, in religious movements that predicted the Second Coming, as the Millerites did in 1843-1844, or in the case of the widely publicized Mayan prophecy in December 2012.

The general pattern with cognitive dissonance situations is that the less heavily invested will eventually drop away. Some who are relatively heavily committed may find similar affiliations to which they can transfer their loyalties. But a core group will remain, even in the face of predictions or prophecies that simply didn't happen. That includes at least some of the QAnon believers who have remained loyal. What keeps them there?

In the first place, no one who has made a heavy commitment to any belief likes to admit that they have made a mistake. In addition, the belief is likely to be one around which they have structured their view of the world. That certainly was the case with QAnon's predictions.

This was to be the final battle between the virtuous forces of Trump and his allies against the quintessential evil of the deep state, after whose defeat some final quasi-paradise would presumably emerge. When that kind of prediction goes wrong, it carries a lot of potential psychological damage with it.

Consequently, one way of dealing with the dissonance is to try to keep the belief even in the face of a world that denies that the belief had any validity.

There are two ways of dealing with this: One is to tinker with the timing of the prediction; the other is to reinterpret the prediction itself. Believers in Q have done both.

SEE ALSO: Trump's new acting attorney general promoted hot tubs for a scam company that got shut down by the government

QAnon's ideas actually seem to have spread in December 2017 and January 2018, after the failed predictions had passed, perhaps partially due to that fact that by then Q's ideas had been picked up and spread by the conspiracy-monger Alex Jones.

The surge of interest in Q in the months following the nonfulfillment of the November 2017 prediction indicates that believers were willing to cut Q some slack, felt the November prediction might only have been approximate, or thought it might refer to an entire period rather than some specific day.

In any case, unlike some previous times of prophetic disappointment, there was no single, dramatic moment of despair. Nonetheless, as time passed, it became clear that the anti-deep state coup had not taken place.

Consequently, believers had to keep pushing it further and further into the future if they were to continue crediting Q's pronouncements. Q justified the delay by reminding adherents that years of corruption made law enforcement agencies inefficient and slow-moving, so the wave of promised arrests would come more slowly than many thought.

That's a recognizable strategy of failed millenarianism; the event has been delayed because the world was too corrupt for redemption yet.

Guests attend a rally where President Donald Trump was speaking to show support for Ohio Republican congressional candidate Troy Balderson wearing 'Q' shirts. Scott Olson/Getty Images The other strategy for coping with dissonance is to reinterpret the prediction so that it means something either less concrete or less imminent. Q made this easy because there are a great many Q postings, and many of them are cryptic.

Q referred to them as ""crumbs,"" bits of intelligence dribbled out in small portions rather than presented in logical, systematic presentations. As a result, believers are left with a body of sometimes obscure texts that must be explicated in the light of events. What was once a subculture of eager expectation becomes one of continual reinterpretation.

The president and the prophet

The saga of Q and their faithful band of believers tells us something not only about the willingness of people to stay loyal to their beliefs even in the face of a world that contradicts them. It also suggests the strength of the appetite for inside information that will assure people that they alone know how the world really works, especially knowledge about ultimate events concerning the struggle between good and evil.

In that sense, the ideas that attracted Q's followers were merely the secular counterpart of the millenarian religions that have loomed so large up to our own day. And where history is seen as culminating in a final struggle between good and evil, conspiracy theories are often not far behind.

Q claimed not only to have knowledge of a deep state conspiracy but to know how its supposedly malevolent designs were going to be defeated.

READ NOW: The midterm results are a setback for Trump, but they might be worse for Vladimir Putin

In a culture already saturated with beliefs about plots and cabals — as contemporary America is — these claims were enormously enticing, despite the total absence of external evidence to support them.

As Trump's own rhetoric has become increasingly inflammatory and apocalyptic, it converges with the ideas of Q and their followers so that what was once the world of the fringe now meets the mainstream.

Indeed, some QAnon supporters believe that Q is Trump — the president and the prophet combined. If there is any lesson to be taken from this bizarre episode, it is that, in the age of Trump, no claim seems too preposterous to find an audience and that, in the age of the internet and social media, these beliefs and those willing to accept them are only too easy to bring together.",mainstream
649,"Claiming to be a high-level government insider, “Q” has been posting cryptic messages on 8Chan, unveiling the extent of the “deep state” while claiming that it is about to be taken down. Here’s a look at this mind-boggling phenomenon.

To some, “Q” is a hero, a patriot, and maybe even something of a savior. To others, Q is a troll conducting either an elaborate LARP (a live-action role-playing game) or a government-conducted PSYOP. At the center of it all: Hundreds of cryptic messages posted on a regular basis by an anonymous 8Chan user who claims to have “Q Clearance”, the “highest level of security within all departments”. (Although we don’t if Q is a man, woman or a group of people, the pronoun “he” will be used in this article for legibility).

Through short forum posts comprised of keywords, codes, riddles, questions, pictures, and bizarre computer commands, Q claims to be delivering the “biggest intel drop in known history”. Every few days, a piece is added to a gigantic conspiracy puzzle which, once understood, is said to unlock the truth about the powers that be. And nothing less.

Through his posts, Q describes a global elite that is evil, satanic, and bent on pedophilia. In his descriptions, this elite group deals with international human trafficking, it orchestrates false flag events to advance its agenda, and conducts occult rituals behind closed doors. It owns and uses Hollywood, mainstream media and social networks to control the narrative and to censor the truth.

While the above might not surprise the average “truther”, Q’s message has a startling twist: Donald Trump is actually raging a silent war against this globalist elite and is even brewing a major “counter-coup” to retake the American government. According to Q, Mueller’s investigation regarding Russian collusion is a front. In actuality, he’s about to indict hundreds of high-profile politicians and celebrities including the Clintons, Podestas, and Soros of this world. This operation is expected to cause intense turmoil and even riots.

Q followers refer to this period as “the storm” – a reference to Trump’s eyebrow-raising remark made on October 6th about a gathering of military officers being “the calm before the storm”. When asked what he meant, Trump responded: “You’ll see.”

Here’s a look at the main elements of the Q phenomenon.

Q uses 8Chan for his intel drops – a board that is virtually unmoderated and populated with users who love to sleuth online and obsesses over details. For this reason, they refer to themselves as “autists”.

The “autistic” element is necessary because Q claims he cannot reveal things directly. He must use codes and questions to “reduce sniffer programs that continually absorb and analyze data”.

Q’s first post, made on October 28th, 2017, made a bold prediction about Hillary Clinton’s arrest, ensuing “massive riots” and the activation of the National Guard across the country on October 30th.

Evidently, October 30th came and went, and none of this happened. This did not stop Q from adding hundreds of additional posts in the following months.

The second crumb utilizes Q’s characteristic short questions and keywords to lay out the core of the plot.

Like many other Q crumbs, this post refers to lots people, theories, and concepts. “Mockingbird” is a keyword that is often used by Q. It most likely refers to the CIA project Operation Mockingbird:

Q’s crumb states that Trump is “isolated”, that he goes around the “three letter agencies”, that he relies on Military intelligence and that he purposely surrounded himself with generals. He adds that the battle is not about Democrats versus Republicans.

Post #133 details Q’s conception of the global elite which, in his words, is hard to swallow.

This post states that the “puppet masters” are based on 3 “sides”, like a triangle: The Saudis, the Rothschilds, and the Soros. At the center of the triangle, the “eye” is fed by governments worldwide using slush funds, wars, and environmental pacts. Q then alludes to Satan worship and Epstein Island. More specifically, he mentions the bizarre temple on Epstein Island, which he believes has hidden levels below.

Jeffrey Epstein is a highly influential billionaire who was known for organizing massive parties with high-profile politicians and celebrities. Flight records show Bill Clinton flew on Epstein’s plane 26 times. In 2008, Epstein was convicted of soliciting an underage “sex slave” for prostitution, for which he served 13 months in prison.

Later crumbs allude to the importance of “spirit cooking” and mind controlled slaves in Hollywood.

Analyzing each crumb could fill an encyclopedia. Throughout his posts, Q touches on a variety of topics such as the Vegas shooting, the Saudi regime change, the North Korean negotiations, the tracking of Edward Snowden, a push for an Internet Bill of Rights and much more.

For many, these claims are hard to believe and “fake news”. However, Q’s “proofs” – evidence that he is directly connected with the POTUS – has turned many skeptics into believers.

To prove the fact that he is close to the POTUS, Q submitted revealing pictures and predicted some POTUS-related events. This led many to believe that he is indeed a White House insider. Some even believe Q is Trump himself. Here are some examples of proofs.

A Trump tweet posted on November 8th, which celebrated the one year anniversary of his election win, is said to contain clues relating to Q.

If one goes on Trump’s official Twitter account to this specific picture, the file name will be DOITQJ8UIAAowsQ.jpg. The fact that the first letters spell out “DO IT Q” is interpreted by some as clue confirming that Q is directly connected to Trump.

Also, the headline of the newspaper in front of Trump says: “Princes and tycoons arrested in Saudi crackdown on corruption” – a topic often brought up in Q crumbs.

Finally, this is one of the tweet’s replies:

On December 10th, Q’s crumb said that they’ve picked out a “special place” for GS (possibly George Soros). On December 17th, Trump posted a tweet using the words “special place” which was interpreted as another clue.

Q often insists on noting the similarity between his posts and the tweets sent out by the POTUS.

On December 12th, Q posted a picture of a pen next to a White House stationery with the message “Merry Christmas”.

When an 8Chan user highlighted this connection, Q posted another picture of this mysterious pen.

In an interview, the journalist Jerome Corsi believes to have identified the mysterious desk.

On January 7th, a Trump tweet contained a mistake where the word “consensual” was used instead of “consequential”.

Although the mistake was corrected a few minutes afterward, it quickly made headlines and was widely ridiculed.

However, according to Q followers, the typo was no accident. The fact that Trump omitted and then added a word with letter Q was interpreted as a message from Trump to Q followers. Q himself added that it was no accident.

In the evening of December 10th, Q’s drop contained the words Blunt & Direct Time. The next one mentioned “false flag(s)” and “fireworks”.

The next morning, a pipe bomb partially detonated in the New York City Subway’s Times Square–42nd Street/Port Authority Bus Terminal station. The suspected bomber was identified by police as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah, a Salafi Muslim immigrant from Bangladesh.

The following evening, Q explained what he meant by “Blunt & Direct Time”.

BDT is the currency of Bangladesh. Therefore, the crumb implies that Q was aware of the coming “fireworks” and of the nationality of the terrorist.

Several other proofs circulate around The Storm, all of which can be interpreted as undeniable clues from the POTUS himself or mere coincidences dreamt up by overactive minds.

As expected, media coverage about Q is extremely biased, partisan and opinionated. One of the first articles regarding Q appeared in NYmag. The article states:

Newsweek magazine’s coverage of the phenomenon is also extremely critical. The title says it all: “How the Storm Became the Biggest Fake News Story of 2018“.

In March, the Comedy Central show The Opposition With Jordan Keppler poked fun at Q and The Storm.

At the other end of the spectrum, Alex Jones firmly believes in the authenticity of Q. On December 24th he stated:

Liz Crokin, a journalist for TownHall.com has stated in an interview that she believes that Q might be Trump himself.

“Now, I believe Q is President Trump, working possibly with Stephen Miller, to drop this information behind the scenes to get a campaign going, to red-pill people as to what is going on with The Storm, and their takedown of the Deep State, which includes the Deep State pedophile scene. I’ve been telling people for a very long time the stuff that goes on with these elitists, these occult elitists, who literally are raping, sacrificing children, drinking blood, like eating babies literally. It’s too hard for an average person that has no idea that any of this is going on to take it in all at once. So there’s been a very orchestrated effort behind the scenes by President Trump and his administration to slowly wake up the public as to what, that A), this goes on, that it’s real, and B), that they’re taking down these people. When there are mass arrests, and there are names like Hillary Clinton that pop up, or thrown in prison for sex trafficking, there’s not mass hysteria. People will realize, ‘Oh my gosh, maybe this is real,’ or like, this isn’t just some kind of coup or whatever, this is real and this is really going on.”

While Q is an extremely polarizing figure, there are facts about the phenomenon that should be obvious to all. First, everything about Q is 100% pro-Trump and in full accord with Trump’s entire political agenda. From a PR perspective, it is an effective and innovative way of bolstering support for Trump while bypassing mass media.

But is this all true? Is Trump truly taking down a network of globalist Satanists? Is this why 90% of the media coverage of Trump negative? Conversely, is The Storm actually a way of gaining the support of “truthers” while, in actuality, no storm is actually happening? Could it be the most elaborate LARP in human history, conducted by a brilliant troll?

One thing is for sure: There is something profoundly messianic about the Q phenomenon. Prophecies of great tribulations and promises of delivering the world from Satan’s followers indeed take on epic, biblical proportions. Through “miraculous” tweets and pictures, Q has converted droves of skeptics into devout followers who are now believers and are ready to spread his word. Q himself adds to this mystique by often mentioning God and quoting the Lord’s Prayer.

So, is Q the real deal? As he says himself, “truth always wins”. Only time will tell if his prophecies of a Final Judgement will come to pass or if he’ll end up being another false prophet.",conspiracy
95,"(Reuters) - Social media website Reddit Inc, known for its commitment to free speech, will crack down on online harassment by banning or suspending users who target others, starting with those who have directed abuse at Chief Executive Steve Huffman.

Huffman said in an interview with Reuters that Reddit’s content policy prohibits harassment, but that it had not been adequately enforced.

“Personal message harassment is the most cut and dry,” he said. “Right now we are in an interesting position where my inbox is full of them, it’s easy to start with me.”

As well as combing through Huffman’s inbox, Reddit will monitor user reports, add greater filtering capacity, and take a more proactive role in policing its platform rather than relying on community moderators.

Reddit said it had identified hundreds of the “most toxic users” and will warn, ban or suspend them. It also plans to increase staff on its “trust and safety” team.

Reddit’s moves are the latest step by social media companies to adjust their policies in the wake of a polarizing U.S. election earlier this month in which their websites played a key role.

Facebook said it is reviewing its approach to so-called ‘fake news’ - generally sensational but fictitious reports designed to attract as many readers as possible - and banning some sites which host fake news from its advertising network. Twitter is also rolling out new tools to combat abuse.

On Reddit, a channel supporting the U.S. Republican party’s presidential candidate Donald Trump, called r/The_Donald, featured racist and misogynistic comments, fake news and conspiracy theories about his Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton, along with more mainstream expressions of support for Trump.

Many of those supporting Trump were very active, voting up the r/The_Donald conversations so that they became prominent across Reddit, which is the 7th-most-visited U.S. internet site, according to web data firm Alexa.

Last week, Reddit banned Pizzagate, a community devoted to a conspiracy theory, with no evidence to back it up, that links Clinton to a pedophile ring at a Washington, D.C. pizza parlor, after it posted personal information in violation of Reddit policy.

Huffman then used his administrative privileges to redirect abuse he was receiving on a thread on r/The_Donald to the community’s moderators - making it look as if it was intended for them. Huffman said it was a prank, and that many Reddit users, including some Trump supporters, told him they thought it was funny, but it inflamed the situation.

Reddit has a more permissive attitude than Facebook and Twitter when it comes to what it allows on its site, but r/The_Donald users frequently crossed a line, Huffman said, including by trying to manipulate voting to ensure their posts appear on prominent Reddit pages.

Reddit has stepped up its efforts to combat abuse on the site over the past year, creating what it called an ‘anti-evil” team of engineers dedicated to fighting harassment.

“The fact I was saying that combating harassment was important and then letting that openly happen to me, the CEO, there’s a disconnect there,” Huffman said.

In the past, Reddit has worked with moderators of communities to try to enforce its rules.

With r/The_Donald in particular, “we haven’t found that to be particularly effective. We might see flashes of success, but things kind of revert,” Huffman said.

Under its new strategy, Reddit will take a more active role in dealing with troublemakers, who Huffman said were an “infinitesimal” portion of Reddit’s 250 million monthly visitors.

He stressed that the move was not political.

“We don’t want to be censoring political beliefs, but then they do misbehave,” he said. “That’s why we have worked so closely with the r/The_Donald community. We tell them: don’t force us to ban you.”

The first wave of bans will likely be skewed to the r/The_Donald community because “that is a catalyst for a lot of this right now. That community is stirred up,” Huffman said.

In a draft of a blog post to be published on Wednesday, Huffman said he had been asked by many Reddit users “to ban r/The_Donald outright, but he had rejected that idea, because “if there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.”",mainstream
916,"Economist John Williams says President Trump has to do something fast and big to turn the faltering U.S. economy around. Williams explains, “You are seeing the economy slow down. Some people are recognizing that. The Fed’s statement a week or two ago . . . many analysts consider that dovish. The Fed knows what’s going on here. They are trying to get rates up a little, but they have a circumstance that they are not out of the woods with the banks. What they are hoping for is maybe the Trump Administration is going to bail them out and stimulate the economy.”

Williams says “The banks are still not healthy. . . . The Fed is still fighting the battle it effectively lost in 2008. Mr. Trump has several problems. One is the economy. One is the long term budget deficit, and the third is the Federal Reserve. The Fed lost control of the system. The system effectively collapsed. They haven’t been able to bring it back to normal.”

Would Donald Trump simply default on the U.S. debt if countries around the world dump U.S. Treasury bonds? Williams says, “That would be an act of default. You don’t want to do that. What Trump needs to do is address the long term solvency issues of the United States. Then he can convince people that, yes, we are going to be able to handle this, and at the same time, take action to stimulate the economy. That could be very bullish for the dollar fundamentally. . . . If they want this to work and save the system, and Mr. Trump will come out of this with his face on Mount Rushmore if he does, he’s got to turn the economy. To do that, he needs to increase government spending in areas that would help stimulate the economy. He’s got to cut taxes, and that is in the works in some form. As part of the process, there very likely will be a widening of the budget deficit, which could kill the dollar and kill people holding Treasuries.”

Williams says Trump must address the “long term solvency of the United States.” Williams goes on to say, “If he does this, the rest of the world will say, boy, they brought things under control, and they would be happy to own the Treasury bonds. I don’t know if this can be done, but this is what you got to do.”

If Trump does not succeed, Williams says, “The problem will be with the dollar. If the system is not brought under control, the rest of the world is going to dump the dollar. . . . The underlying fundamentals have not changed. The U.S. dollar is, in the long term, insolvent. What has changed here is that there is a chance that the Trump Administration can correct it. As far as I can see, this (Trump) is the last chance to correct it.”

1008,"A host on the far-right US conspiracy and disinformation website InfoWars has been removed from the latest impeachment hearing by police, after interrupting House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler with pro-Donald Trump messages.

The interruption came from a host on the fringe conservative website who led a racist call earlier this year for the lynching of Barack Obama, America's first African American president.

The host was seen being led out by Capitol Police after the interruption on Monday, shortly after the start of the hearings in which politicians are to question the counsels hired by the House Intelligence Committee to spearhead questioning during earlier impeachment hearings.

""Americans are sick of your impeachment scam! Trump is innocent!"" said the protester, Owen Shroyer.

Mr Shroyer had attracted attention to himself earlier this year with a racist call to lynch Mr Obama, whom he called ""treasonous"" during an interview with the far-right website Breitbart. He cited a conspiracy theory that has been pushed with no evidence by far-right actors as proof of the former president's alleged misdeeds.

""Folks, Obama was emailing Hillary Clinton on her illegal server under a secret name, that came out in emails. And he claimed he didn't know she had it. Barack Obama is a treasonous ... he belongs in jail. He belongs in Guantanamo Bay. I mean look, I'm not saying this should happen but Barack Obama, you know, find the tallest tree and a rope.""

Mr Shroyer's disruption was live streamed by the conspiracy theorist on Twitter, and posted onto his own handle.

Previously, he has pushed conspiracy theories like Pizzagate, a debunked theory that went viral during the 2016 election season claiming that falsely claimed that top Democratic officials were running a child sex ring in the basement of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza parlour in Washington.

The building does not have a basement, but the conspiracy theory resulted in one individual driving to the restaurant with a gun, planning to liberate the victims that did not exist.

But, Mr Shroyer has also peddled further conspiracy theories, some of them even more bizarre than a concentrated effort by America's top Democrats to hide a child sex trafficking ring in a pizza shop.

Among those other conspiracy theories include the 2012 claim that a hurricane headed towards Hawaii had been split in two by an energy beam from Antarctica, which he suggested may have been ordered by then-secretary of State John Kerry.",mainstream
412,"Google has removed multiple applications from its Google Play Store that were used to promote the QAnon conspiracy theory.

The QAnon conspiracy is a idea based on the notion of an anonymous figure called 'Q' who claims to have classified information about the Trump administration. This includes the belief that opposition to the government operate in “deep state” which works to undermine him.

The conspiracy is also linked to the unfounded 'Pizzagate' conspiracy from 2016, which claimed that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, among other members of the US establishment, was involved in an apparent child abuse ring.

QAnon believers have had their own lawyers argue that belief in the conspiracy proves they are insane, and have climbed the Sydney Harbour Bridge to spread the ideology. The FBI has stated that QAnon is a potential domestic terrorist threat.

As reported by Media Matters, a not-for-profit progressive research centre, which brought the applications’ violations of Google policies to the search giant’s attention, QMAP, Q Alerts!, and Q Alerts LITE were removed from the Android store. Google’s privacy policy states that apps which have “content related to terrorism, such as content that promotes terrorist acts, incites violence, or celebrates terrorist attacks” are forbidden.

A Google spokesperson said in a statement that: “When we find apps that violate Play policy by distributing misleading or harmful information, we remove them from the store.”

It is unclear how many people downloaded the applications, or whether Google profited from any microtransactions or other payments made by people through the app. Google takes a 30 percent cut of all payments made through in-app purchases on its store. Google did not provide a comment.

The QAnon conspiracy theories have also interlinked with false beliefs about the coronavirus with some suggesting that the disease is a cover so Trump can secretly arrest ‘deep state agents’ while others believe that COVID-19 is part of “spiritual warfare” where only those chosen by God will not be affected.

Google has had to take action against coronavirus misinformation too, working with the NHS as well as Facebook and Twitter to crack down on hoaxes.",mainstream
44,"James Reader tried to do everything right. No fake news, no sloppiness, no spam. The 54-year-old teamster and San Diego resident with a progressive bent had a history of activism, but itched to get more involved. So a few years ago he tinkered with a blog called the Everlasting GOP Stoppers, and it did well enough to persuade some friends and investors to take a bigger step.

“We got together and became Reverb Press,” he recalls. “I didn’t start it for the money. I did it because I care about my country.”

In 2014, he launched Reverb, a site that shared news from a pro-Democratic stance but also, Reader says, took great care to be correct and factual. The independent watchdog site mediabiasfactcheck.com would declare it strongly slanted left but rated it “high for factual reporting, as all news is sourced to credible media outlets.”

The site took off, especially during the 2015-16 election season. “We had 30 writers contributing, four full-time editors and an IT worker,” Reader says. “At our peak, we had 4 million to 5 million unique visitors a month.”

Through and social media, Reader estimates, as many as 13 million people a week were seeing Reverb stories. Much of the content was aggregated or had titles like “36 Scariest Quotes From the 2015 GOP Presidential Debates.” But Reverb also did original reporting, like a first-person account of Catholic Church abuse in New Jersey that was picked up by mainstream outlets.

Like most independent publishers, he relied heavily on a Facebook page to drive traffic and used Facebook tools to help boost his readership. “We were pouring between $2,000 and $6,000 a month into Facebook, to grow the page,” Reader says. “We tried to do everything they suggested.”

Publishers like Reader jumped to it every time Facebook sent hints about changes to its algorithm. When it emphasized video, he moved to develop video content. Reader viewed Facebook as an essential tool for independent media. “Small blogs cannot exist without Facebook,” he says. “At the same time, it was really small blogs that helped Facebook explode in the first place.”

But Reader began noticing a problem. Starting with the 2016 election, he would post articles that would end up in right-wing Facebook groups, whose followers would pelt his material with negative comments. He also suspected they were mass-reporting his stories to Facebook as spam.

Ironically, Reader, whose site regularly covered Russia-gate stories, suspected his business was being impacted by everyone from Republican operatives to MAGA-hat wearers and Russian trolls anxious to dent his pro-Democratic content. “It could have been Russians,” he says. “It could have been domestic groups. But it really seemed to be some kind of manipulation.”

Reader saw drops in traffic. Soon, ad sales declined and he couldn’t afford to invest in Facebook’s boosting tools anymore, and even when he did, they weren’t working in the same way. “It was like crack-dealing,” he says. “The first hits are free, but pretty soon you have to spend more and more just to keep from losing ground.”

He went to Facebook to complain, but Reader had a difficult time finding a human being at the company to discuss his problems. Many sources contacted for this story describe a similar Kafka’s Castle-type experience of dealing with Facebook. After months of no response, Reader finally reached an acquaintance at Facebook and was told the best he could do was fill out another form. “The guy says to me, ‘It’s about scale, bro,’ ” he recalls. In other words, in a Facebook ecosystem with more than 2 billion users, if you’re too small, you don’t matter enough for individual attention.

After all this, on October 11th this year, Reader was hit with a shock. “I was driving home in San Diego when people started to call with bad news,” he says. They said Reverb had been taken offline. He got home and clicked on his computer:

“Facebook Purged Over 800 Accounts and Pages for Pushing Political Spam,” a Washington Post headline read.

The story described an ongoing effort against “coordinated inauthentic behavior” and specifically named just a few sites, including Reverb, that were being removed. The Facebook announcement mentioned “timing ahead of the U.S. midterm elections,” implying that the deletions had been undertaken to preserve the integrity of American democracy — from people like James Reader.

Reader wasn’t alone. He was one of hundreds of small publishers to get the ax in Facebook’s October 11th sweep, which quickly became known as “the Purge” in alternative-media circles. After more minor sweeps of ostensibly fake foreign accounts over the summer, the October 11th deletions represented something new: the removal of demonstrably real American media figures with significant followings. Another round of such sites would be removed in the days before the midterms, this time without an announcement. Many of these sites would also be removed from other platforms like Twitter virtually simultaneously.

“All this happens on the same day?” Reader asks. “There’s no way it’s not connected.”

The sites were all over the map politically. Some, like the Trump-supporting Nation in Distress, had claimed Obama would declare martial law if Trump won in 2016. Others, like Reverb and Blue State Daily, were straight-up, Democrat-talking-point sites that ripped Trump and cheered the blues.

Many others, like the L.A.-based Free Thought Project and Anti-Media, were anti-war, focused on police brutality or drug laws, and dismissive of establishment politics in general. Targeting the latter sites to prevent election meddling seemed odd, since they were openly disinterested in elections. “If anything, we try to get people to think beyond the two parties,” says Jason Bassler, a 37-year-old activist who runs the Free Thought Project.

Reader tried to access his sites. The Facebook page for Reverb had been unpublished. Same for his old Everlasting GOP Stoppers blog. Even a newer page of his called America Against Trump, with 225,000 followers, was unpublished. “Everything I’d worked for all those years was dead,” he says.

Reader seethed about being lumped in with Russian election meddlers. But somehow worse was Facebook’s public description of his site as being among “largely domestic actors using clickbait headlines and other spam tactics to drive users to websites where they could target them with ads.”

This grated, since he felt that Facebook’s programs were themselves designed to make sure that news audiences stayed in-house to consume Facebook advertising.

“This is all about money,” Reader says. “It’s a giant company trying to monopolize all behavior on the Internet. Anything that can happen, they only want it to happen on Facebook.”

AFTER DONALD TRUMP was elected in 2016, Facebook — and Silicon Valley in general — faced a lot of heat. There was understandable panic that fake news — be it the work of Russian ad farms, or false stories spread about Barack Obama by Macedonian trolls, or insane conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and “Pizzagate” — was having a destructive impact, responsible for everything from Brexit to the election of our Mad Hatter president.

Everyone from journalism professors to sociologists to former Facebook employees blamed the social network for rises in conspiracism, Russian meddling and hate speech. “News feed optimizes engagement,” said former Facebook designer Bobby Goodlatte. “Bullshit is highly engaging.”

Politicians began calling for increased regulation, but Facebook scoffed at the idea that it was responsible for Trump, or anything else. Moreover, at least publicly, the firm had always been resistant to sifting out more than porn, threats and beheading videos. Its leaders insisted they were about “bringing people together,” not editing content. “We are a tech company, not a media company,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2016, after visiting with the pope.

Facebook’s touchy-feely vibing about togetherness and “friends” was probably part true, part thin veil for a voracious business plan: get as many humans herded in-site as possible, so they can have truckloads of ads shoved through their eyeballs. Restricting speech was a problem because it meant restricting speakers, which meant restricting cash flow.

To keep regulatory wolves at bay, Facebook had one thing to bargain with: its own unused political might. By 2017, 45 percent of Americans were getting news from Facebook, making it by far the largest social media news source in the country. A handful of executives could now offer governments (including our own) a devil’s bargain: increased control over information flow in exchange for free rein to do their booming eyeball-selling business.

We could have responded to the fake-news problem in a hundred different ways. We could have used European-style laws to go after Silicon Valley’s rapacious data-collection schemes that incentivize clickbait and hyper-partisanship. We could have used anti-trust laws to tackle monopolistic companies that wield too much electoral influence. We could have recognized de facto mega-distributors as public utilities, making algorithms for things like Google searches and Facebook news feeds transparent, allowing legitimate media outlets to know how they’re being regulated, and why.

Instead, this story may be turning into one of the oldest narratives in politics: the misuse of a public emergency to suspend civil rights and concentrate power. One recurring theme of the fake-news controversy has been a willingness of those in power to use the influence of platforms like Facebook, rather than curtail or correct them. Accused of being an irresponsible steward of information, Facebook is now being asked to exercise potentially vast and opaque new powers.

The accumulation of all these scandals has taken a toll on the company. A recent Pew survey found that 44 percent of users between ages 18 and 29 deleted Facebook from their phones in the past year.

Now there’s this. You thought you didn’t like Facebook before? Wait until you see it in its new role as Big Brother.

THE IRONY IS, Facebook’s business model once rested on partisanship, divisiveness and clickbait. One of the many reasons Trump won, as former Facebook product manager Antonio García Martínez described in Wired, was the campaign’s expert use of Facebook’s ads auction, which rewarded ad developers for efficiently stoking lizard-brain responses. The company, García Martínez wrote, “uses a complex model that considers both the dollar value of each bid as well as how good a piece of clickbait . . . the corresponding ad is.”

A canny marketer, García Martínez wrote, could “goose” purchasing power if Facebook’s estimation of its “clickbaitness” was high. The Trump campaign’s superior grip on this dynamic allowed it to buy choice ad space at bargain prices, while the reverse was true for Clinton.

In other words, the same company that rewarded the red-meatiest content and hyperpartisan drivel that political lunatics like alleged MAGA Bomber Cesar Sayoc devoured was now publicly denouncing sites like Reverb News for . . . clickbait.

Reader wondered why his site had been chosen. He admits to using multiple backup profiles, which is a technical violation, but he insists this would have previously earned a slap on the wrist. Several of the other deleted sites were right-wing or libertarian (although Facebook hasn’t released a full list of the purged sites). Reader wondered if Facebook — as it reportedly did after a Gizmodo piece in 2016 claimed Facebook suppressed conservatives — was attempting to overcompensate by targeting a blue-leaning operation.

Tiffany Willis Clark, whose page for her site Liberal America was taken down on November 2nd, is similarly baffled as to why. A self-described “Christian left” publisher from Texas who pushes a Democratic line, she says Liberal America, with its 750,000 followers, is a “lifestyle site” about “raising conscious kids who are aware of the suffering of others.” She insists she’s never engaged in any banned Facebook behaviors and is careful to source everything to reputable news organizations. An example of her content is a listicle, “87 Things Only Poor Kids Know and Conservatives Couldn’t Care Less About,” that contains lines like “We go to the doctor when we’re sick, but mom doesn’t.”

Clark created the site for political and spiritual reasons, and believes she has helped reach people with her down-to-earth approach. “I’ve had people tell me they’ve switched parties because of us,” Clark says. “We didn’t do this for the money. That was a happy accident.”

She was surprised to see traffic take off after launching in 2013, and began investing in the site as a business. Clark estimates that she has spent $150,000 on Facebook boosting tools since 2014. “I basically put my life savings into this, and it’s gone,” she says. Like many of the people contacted for this story, she regrets having built a business around an Internet platform with a constantly shifting set of standards.

“Facebook seems to be redefining its mission minute to minute,” she says. “They started with fake news, moved to Alex Jones, and now it seems to be anything that’s not mainstream media.”

The belief that the recent deletions represent the start of a campaign against alternative media in general have been stoked by the fact that in its efforts to police fake news, Facebook recently began working with a comical cross section of shadowy officialdom: meeting with the Foreign Influence Task Force at the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security; partnering with the Atlantic Council, a NATO-connected organization featuring at least six former CIA heads on its board; and working with a pair of nonprofits associated with the major political parties, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute.

“It’s a blatant attack on independent media in advance of the election,” says Sean Conners of Blue State Daily.

“This is a real thing,” says Bobby Rodrigo, a member of the Georgia Society of Professional Journalists and an admin to more than a hundred social media accounts for independent media and charity sites. “Lots of people I know have been affected. And not enough reporters are paying attention.”

NEWS FLASH: There’s always been weird shit on the Internet. Not long ago, that’s even what a lot of us liked about the medium. Everything was on the Net, from goat sex to “Thirteen Bizarre Stipulations in Wills” to all the evidence you needed if you wanted to prove Sasquatch is real. None of this was ever regulated in any serious way, in keeping with a historically very permissive attitude toward speech.

We’ve traditionally tolerated fakes (the 1938 radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds reportedly scared one in 12 listeners into believing Earth had been invaded by Mars) and conspiracy kooks like the LaRouchians. In modern history, we’ve mostly relied upon libel laws, market forces and occasional interventions from the Federal Communications Commission to regulate speech.

Obviously, no one has a constitutional right to a Facebook page or a Twitter account. As ACLU lawyer Ben Wizner points out, there’s no First Amendment issue here. “To the extent First Amendment rights figure in at all, they’re enjoyed by the companies, who get to decide what does and does not go on their platforms,” he says. But the fact that removals are probably legal does not mean they’re not worrisome. If a handful of companies are making coordinated decisions about content, especially in conjunction with official or quasi-official bodies, this has far-reaching implications for the press.

Eric Goldman of the Santa Clara University School of Law calls the problem “soft censorship,” adding, “We’re seeing removal of content that isn’t illegal but the government doesn’t like. It’s a backdoor form of censorship.”

Once viewed as a revolutionary tool for democratization and personal empowerment, the Internet always had awesome potential as a lever for social control, as we’ve already seen overseas.

When it comes to Internet companies working with governments, there are two main dangers.

In the first, a repressive government uses an Internet platform to accelerate human-rights abuses. The worst example of this is in Myanmar, where the U.N. recently concluded Facebook may have been key in helping incite government-sponsored genocide against that nation’s Rohingya Muslim minority.

The campaign against the Rohingya led to mass murder, arson and rape, and caused 700,000 to flee abroad and left thousands dead. The attackers were egged on by Myanmar officials and descended upon Rohingya settlements in a murderous rage.

A series of posts on Facebook in the Buddhist-majority country called Muslim minorities maggots, dogs and rapists, and said things like, “We must fight them the way Hitler did the Jews.” Facebook at the time had only a handful of Burmese speakers on staff reviewing this content, and the U.N. concluded that the platform had “turned into a beast.”

Facebook has since deleted accounts of Myanmar military figures accused of inciting violence, citing the same offense it applied to the likes of James Reader: “coordinated inauthentic behavior.”

The flip side of being too little engaged is to have intimate relationships between foreign governments and companies involved in speech regulation.

In March this year, for instance, after the company had unknowingly helped spread a campaign of murder, rape and arson in Myanmar, Facebook unpublished the popular Palestinian news site SAFA, which had 1.3 million followers.

SAFA had something like official status, an online answer to the Palestine Authority’s WAFA news agency. (SAFA has been reported to be sympathetic to Hamas, which the publication denies.) Its operators say they also weren’t given any reason for the removal. “They didn’t even send us a message,” says Anas Malek, SAFA’s social media coordinator. “We were shocked.”

The yanking of SAFA took place just ahead of a much-publicized protest in the region: the March 30th March of the Great Return, in which Gaza Strip residents were to try to return to their home villages in Israel; it resulted in six months of violent conflict. Malek and his colleagues felt certain SAFA’s removal from Facebook was timed to the march. “This is a direct targeting of an effective Palestinian social media voice at a very critical time,” he says.

Israel has one of the most openly cooperative relationships with Facebook: The Justice Ministry in 2016 boasted that Facebook had fulfilled “95 percent” of its requests to delete content. The ministry even proposed a “Facebook bill” that would give the government power to remove content from Internet platforms under the broad umbrella of “incitement.” Although it ultimately failed, an informal arrangement already exists, as became clear this October.

That month, Israel’s National Cyber Directorate announced that Facebook was removing “thousands” of accounts ahead of municipal elections. Jordana Cutler, Facebook’s head of policy in Israel — and a former adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — said the company was merely following suggestions. “We receive requests from the government but are not committed to them,” Cutler said.

This template should worry Americans. The First Amendment prevents the government from ordering platforms to take down content. But as is clear in places like Israel, sometimes a suggestion is more than just a suggestion. “If they say they’re ‘not obligated,’ that should come with an asterisk,” says Goldman.

The most troubling example of private-public cooperation is probably the relationship between Google and China. The company whose motto was once “Don’t Be Evil” is reportedly going ahead with plans for a censor-friendly “Dragonfly” search engine. The site could eliminate search terms like “human rights” and “Nobel prize” for more than a billion people.

The lack of press interest here is remarkable. Had an American company on the scale of Google helped the Soviets develop a censorship tool, the story would have dominated the press, but it has barely made headlines in the States.

Somewhere between the Myanmar and Israel models is the experience of Germany, which last year passed a broad Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG) requiring deletion of illegal content that violates German law against incitement to crime, hatred or the use of banned political symbols. Facebook tried to keep up with the NetzDG by hiring thousands to work in “deletion centers” in Essen and Berlin. But this year a German court ruled Facebook cannot take down content that is not illegal, which some believe may force the company to allow things like nude pictures. “This will get really interesting,” is how one European tech-policy researcher put it.

If content removal is messy in Germany, which has clear and coherent laws against certain kinds of speech, how would such an effort play out in America, which has a far more permissive legal tradition?

We would soon find out.

Just more than a year ago, on October 31st, a subcommittee of U.S. senators held a hearing to question representatives of Google, Facebook and Twitter. The subject was “Extremist Content and Russian Disinformation Online: Working With Tech to Find Solutions.” The grilling took place during the peak of public outrage about fake news. Facebook had just announced it would be turning over about 3,000 ads created by a Russian “Internet Research Agency.”

For the hearing, the tech firms sent lawyers to take abuse. The two chief counsels present — Colin Stretch of Facebook and Sean Edgett of Twitter, plus Richard Salgado, law enforcement director at Google — looked pained throughout, as though awaiting colonoscopies.

Although the ostensible purpose of the event was to ask the platforms to help prevent foreign interference in elections, it soon became clear that Senate partisans were bent on pushing pet concerns.

Republican Chuck Grassley, for instance, pointed to ads targeting Baltimore, Cleveland and Ferguson, Missouri, which he said “spread stories about abuse of black Americans by law enforcement. These ads are clearly intended to worsen racial tensions.”

Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono insisted that the Russian ads had affected the election and asked the Silicon Valley reps to come up with a “mission statement” to “prevent the fomenting of discord.”

When Stretch tried to offer a hedging answer about Facebook’s mission being the promotion of community (translation: “We already have a good enough mission”), Hirono cut him off and reminded him of a word he had used earlier. “Authenticity,” she said. “I kind of like that as a mission statement.”

Even if one stipulates every concern about foreign meddling is true, Hirono was playing with fire. Tightening oversight to clamp down on illegal foreign propaganda is one thing. Asking the world’s most powerful media companies to create vague new missions in search of “authenticity” and the prevention of “discord” is something else.

So how would the Senate make Facebook bend the knee? We got a clue in July, when Sen. Mark Warner released a white paper waving a regulatory leash at Silicon Valley. Warner proposed legislation requiring “first-party consent for data collection,” which would cut back on the unwanted use of personal data. This was a gun to the head of the industry, given that most of the platforms depend on the insatiable collection of such data for advertising sales.

The companies by then had already made dramatic changes. Google made tweaks to its normal, non-Chinese search engine in April 2017. Dubbed “Project Owl,” the changes were designed to prevent fake news — Holocaust-denial sites were cited as an example — from scoring too high in search results.

Although the campaign against fake news has often been described as necessary to combat far-right disinformation, hate speech and, often, Trump’s own false statements, some of the first sites to feel the sting of the new search environment seemed to be of the opposite persuasion. And this is where it becomes easy to wonder about the good faith of American efforts to rein in the Internet.

After Google revised its search tool in 2017, a range of alternative news operations — from the Intercept to Common Dreams to Amy Goodman’s Democracy Now! — began experiencing precipitous drops in traffic.

One of the first was the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS). According to reporter Andre Damon, the agency performed tests to see how the site fared under the new Google search. It found that in the old search, WSWS stories popped up very high. A few months later, they were nowhere to be found. “If you entered ‘social inequality,’ we were the number-two story in April 2017,” says Damon. “By August, we were out of the top 100 for the same search.”

Damon and others at WSWS, using data from the marketing analytic company SEMRush and Google Webmaster, ran tests on a dozen other anti-war, progressive-leaning sites. They found their own search traffic had dropped 67 percent, and estimated Alternet was down 63 percent, Wikileaks down 30 percent. Every site they measured was down at least 19 percent. “Google pioneered this,” says Damon. (Google stressed that rankings shift with any algorithmic update, and the company says it does not single out sites by name.)

Facebook had also already made dramatic changes to its algorithm, and it wasn’t just left-wing sites that were seeing the crunch. Kevin Roose of The New York Times recently featured a Pennsylvania-based right-wing site called Mad World News that, like Reader, had spent enormous sums on Facebook tools to build an audience — a staggering half-million dollars, the site’s founders claimed. But starting in 2017, the site’s traffic dropped from 20 million views a month to almost nothing, especially after Facebook implemented its “Trusted Sources” algorithm, which de-emphasized commercial sites in favor of more-familiar “local” content.

“Have some integrity, give the money back” is what the Mad World founders told Roose.

But soon, mere algorithmic changes wouldn’t be enough, and the age of outright bans began. On May 17th, Facebook announced it would be working with the Atlantic Council.

Often described by critics as the unofficial lobby group of NATO, the council is a bipartisan rogues’ gallery of senior military leaders, neocons and ex-spies. Former heads of the CIA on its board include Michael Hayden, R. James Woolsey, Leon Panetta and Michael Morell, who was in line to be Hillary Clinton’s CIA chief.

The council is backed financially by weapons-makers like Raytheon, energy titans like Exxon-Mobil and banks like JPMorgan Chase. It also accepts funds from multiple foreign countries, some of them with less-than-sterling reputations for human rights and — notably — press freedoms.

One of its biggest foreign donors is the United Arab Emirates, which this year fell nine spots down, from 119th to 128th place, out of 180 countries listed in the World Press Freedom Index.

When Rolling Stone asked the Atlantic Council about the apparent contradiction of advising Facebook on press practices when it is funded by numerous speech-squelching foreign governments, it replied that donors must submit in writing to strict terms. The statement reads:

“[The] Atlantic Council is accepting the contribution on condition that the Atlantic Council retains intellectual independence and control over any content funded in whole or in part by the contribution.”

Around the same time the partnership was announced, Facebook made a donation to the Atlantic Council between $500,000 and $999,000, placing it among the biggest donors to the think tank.

The social media behemoth could easily have funded its own team of ex-spooks and media experts for the fake-news project. But Facebook employees have whispered to reporters that the council was brought in so that Facebook could “outsource many of the most sensitive political decisions.” In other words, Facebook wanted someone else to take the political hit for removing pages.

Facebook announced its first round of deletions on July 31st, a day after Warner’s white paper was made public. In this first incident, Facebook unpublished 32 sites for “inauthentic behavior.” The accounts looked like someone’s idea of a parody of agitprop. One, Black Elevation, shows the famous photo of Huey Newton in a chair, holding a spear. Significantly, one event page — announcing a counterprotest to an upcoming Unite the Right 2 neo-Nazi march — turned out to be run by a real grassroots protest group called the Shut It Down DC Coalition. These people were peeved to be described as “inauthentic” in the news.

“This is a real protest in Washington, D.C.,” said spokeswoman Michelle Styczynski. “It is not George Soros. It is not Russia. It is just us.”

But the news headlines did not read “Facebook Removes Some Clearly Bogus Memes and One Real Domestic Protest Page.” Instead, the headlines were all gravitas: “Facebook Pulls Fake Accounts That Mimicked Russian Tactics,” wrote The Wall Street Journal; “Facebook Grapples With a Maturing Adversary in Election Meddling” was the unironic New York Times headline.

About a week later, on August 6th, one of the biggest jackasses in American public life was quieted. Four major tech firms — Apple, YouTube, Facebook and Spotify — decided to either completely or partially remove Infowars conspiracy lunatic Alex Jones. Twitter would soon follow suit.

Jones was infamous for, among other things, claiming the child victims of the Sandy Hook shooting were fakes, and his ongoing trolling of grieving Sandy Hook parents is one of the most revolting episodes in modern media. Jones is a favorite of Trump, who once gave Infowars a White House press pass.

The axing of Jones by the tech platforms was cheered by almost everyone in the mainstream press in “Ding-dong! The witch is dead” fashion.

“Finally,” exhaled Slate. “It’s about time,” said Media Matters. Even the right-wing Weekly Standard saluted the move, saying, “There’s no reason for conservatives to be defending this guy.”

Few observers raised an eyebrow at the implications of the Jones episode. The objections were more about the “how?” — not the “who?”

“Nobody complains about Alex Jones [being removed], which you can understand,” says David Chavern of the News Media Alliance. “But what rule did he violate? How does what he did compare to what other people saying similar things did? Nobody really knows.”

“I hate Alex Jones, I hate Infowars,” says the Georgia-based alternative journalist Rodrigo. “But we all saw what was coming.”

Reverb’s James Reader was one of the voices cheering the demise of Jones. Now conservatives are gloating over Reader’s removal from Facebook. “I have to take my lumps on that,” he says. “I still contend we don’t make incitements to violence or any of the bad things Jones does. But I should have been paying attention to the larger story. We all should have.”

AFTER THE REMOVAL of Jones, media and tech-industry types alike wondered about the “what next?” question. What about people who didn’t incite hate or commit libel but were merely someone’s idea of “misleading” or “divisive”?

The Atlantic Council in September put out a paper insisting media producers had a “duty of care” to not “carry the virus” of misinformation. Noting bitterly “the democratization of technology has given individuals capabilities on par with corporations,” the council warned that even domestic content that lacked “context” or “undermines beliefs” could threaten “sovereignty.”

Healing could accelerate, the council argued, by pressuring the market “gatekeepers” to better “filter the quality” of content. “This does not need to be government driven,” it wrote. “Indeed it is better if it is not.”

What does it look like when corporate “gatekeepers” try to “filter” social malcontents? Bassler of the Free Thought Project already had a pretty good idea. Bassler is controversial. On the one hand, he’s one of the most extensive recorders of law-enforcement misbehavior in America. His sites are essentially a giant archive of police-brutality videos. But he has a clear fringe streak. Sift through Free Thought headlines and you’ll find stories about everything from chemtrails to studies that question the efficacy of vaccines.

Overall, the Free Thought Project is a bit like a more politicized, Internet-era version of In Search Of: a mix of real news and the conspiratorial. It aims to fill clear gaps in mainstream-media coverage but also dabbles in themes that would make the Columbia Journalism Review cringe.

Like Reader, Bassler, he says, tried to comply with every Facebook request over the years, because his business depended on it. “I’m not interested in just building a circle jerk of people who agree with me,” says Bassler. “I’m trying to make a difference, so I need Facebook. That’s where the normies are, you know? That’s where you reach people.”

After 2016, Facebook made reaching the “normies” harder for smaller producers. Long before it brought in partners like the Atlantic Council and the International Republican Institute, Facebook invited mainstream-media partners to help fact-check sites. Those included the Associated Press, PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, Snopes and even The Weekly Standard.

Bassler did not do well in this process. Four Free Thought Project stories came up factually wanting under reviews. This caused traffic to plummet in the past two years, under a new Facebook policy algorithmically demoting “false news.” The Free Thought Project may not be ProPublica, but Bassler is no Alex Jones. In two cases, his “false” ratings were later overturned by PolitiFact and AP. But his business still took the hit.

The panel-review system poses serious issues. There’s the obvious problem of established media possibly being offered money from Facebook (reportedly as much as $100,000 annually) to directly reduce the business of smaller competitors.

A story by the Columbia Journalism Review about this process quoted unnamed checkers who professed to be unsure of how Facebook was picking sites for review. Some wondered why mainstream-media stories, like from Fox or MSNBC, were being filtered out. Others wondered why Facebook wasn’t fact-checking paid content.

Conspiracy theories aren’t always wrong, and people who have a conspiratorial bent are for this reason often the first to see real problems. Some important early reporting about the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, came from Zero Hedge, a site now routinely dismissed as conspiratorial.

If the question of whether reporting of this type is or is not legit is left up to panels of corporate media — who are often the targets of criticism from such sites — then even legitimate journalism that “undermines beliefs” will soon become rare. Especially when one considers that “reputable” media is often itself an actor in larger political deceptions (the Iraq-WMD episode being the most recent famous example of how terrible and lasting the consequences of disinformation can be), there’s tremendous danger in removing sites willing to play that challenging role.

Bassler’s Free Thought Project was eventually removed on October 11th. We can’t make any assumptions about why. But the opacity of the sifting process makes it hard not to wonder if such sites were chosen for something other than legitimate reasons.

“Unless they make their methodology transparent, we can’t give them the benefit of the doubt,” says Chavern. “Eventually, ‘Trust us’ isn’t going to be good enough.”

THE NEW ERA of “content regulation” has been a mixed bag. Along with bans of neo-Nazi Daily Stormer content from sites like Google, we’ve seen removals of content like a picture of two women kissing or the banning of Arab-language atheist pages in Muslim countries. Venezuela-based left-wing sites like TeleSUR and VenezuelaAnalysis.com have been suspended or deleted from Facebook, feminist cartoonists have seen content removed in India, and videos of self-immolating Tibetan monks have been found to have violated Facebook “community standards.”

Meanwhile, in smaller incidents, libertarians like Daniel MacAdams of the Ron Paul Institute, progressive organizations like Occupy London and controversial writers such as Australian Caitlin Johnstone — among numerous others — have all been suspended from Twitter and other platforms.

Many of these cases involved suspensions triggered by user complaints, another potential problem area. Since the scale of Internet operations is so vast — billions of pieces of content a day are introduced on platforms like Facebook — companies will always be forced to rely on users to flag problems. As the motives for bans expand, we’ll see more and more people trying to mass-report their online foes into suspensions or bans. Rolling Stone found examples on both the left and the right. For Wizner of the ACLU, this feels key. “If you’re going to have billions of users,” he says, “it’s always going to be Whac-A-Mole. You can’t do it to scale.”

Whatever the democratic cure for what ails us, what we’re doing now is surely the opposite of it. We’ve empowered a small cadre of ex-spooks, tech executives, Senate advisers, autocratic foreign donors and mainstream-media panels to create an unaccountable system of star-chamber content reviews — which unsurprisingly seem so far to have mostly targeted their harshest critics.

“What government doesn’t want to control what news you see?” says Goldman, the law professor.

This is power that would tempt the best and most honest politicians. We’ve already proved that we’re capable of electing the worst and least-honest politicians imaginable. Is this a tool we want such people to have?

On his run to the White House, Donald Trump mined public anxiety and defamed our democracy, but that was just a prelude to selling authoritarianism. On some level, he understood that people make bad decisions when they’re afraid. And he’s succeeded in his short reign in bringing everyone down to his level of nonthinking.

This secretive campaign against fake news may not be Trump’s idea. But it’s a Trump-like idea, something we would never contemplate in a less-frenzied era. We’re scared. We’re not thinking. And this could go wrong in so many ways. For some, it has already.

586,"US President Donald Trump has posted an image of a train hitting a CNN reporter three days after a hit-and-run left one person dead at a far-right rally.

The cartoon, which Mr Trump deleted after tweeting, depicts the cable network logo being run over by a ""Trump Train"" symbolising his supporters.

The president also apparently accidentally retweeted a post by someone calling him ""a fascist"".

Mr Trump is in New York where he faces a second day of protests.

White House officials told NBC the train image - captioned ""Fake news can't stop the Trump Train"" - had been ""inadvertently posted"" and when ""noticed it was immediately deleted"".

In another presumably unintentional retweet, the US president shared - and then also deleted - a post by someone who said of him: ""He's a fascist, so not unusual.""

The Twitter user, @MikeHolden, had been commenting on a Fox report saying that Mr Trump could be planning to pardon Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was found guilty in July of racially profiling Hispanic people.

Mr Holden, of Burnley, England, promptly changed his Twitter bio to read: ""Officially Endorsed by the President of the United States. I wish that were a good thing.""

Asked by the BBC if he thinks the ""endorsement"" ended when Mr Trump deleted the tweet he laughed and said: ""Oh, absolutely. I don't think he really meant to endorse it.

""I don't think he intended to say, 'yup, that's me, the big ol' fascist!'""

""I'm an internet nobody!"" added Mr Holden, a 53-year-old IT consultant, adding the response has been ""absolutely bananas"".

""It's rare you get that kind of attention from the president, isn't it?"" Mr Holden added.
• WATCH: How the internet united against neo-Nazi website

Mr Trump has drawn criticism from both ends of the political spectrum since Saturday's so-called Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a woman was killed.

Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old counter-protester, was killed and 19 other people were injured when a car rammed the crowd. A 20-year-old man is facing murder and other charges.

Mr Trump did not immediately condemn the white supremacists, instead blaming ""many sides"" for ""hatred, bigotry, and violence"" in the university town.

On Monday he sought to clarify his views, denouncing the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis by name.

But in the process he took a moment to demean a CNN reporter.

Asked by journalist Jim Acosta why he had waited so long to condemn the hate groups, Mr Trump responded: ""I like real news, not fake news.""

Pointing the finger at the White House correspondent, he added: ""You are fake news.""

Mr Trump frequently targets the so-called ""fake news media"" in tweets to his nearly 36 million followers.

In May he shared a clip of himself pummelling professional wrestler with a CNN logo superimposed on his face.

Late on Monday, Mr Trump also retweeted a post from an account linked to one of his supporters known for fuelling conspiracy theories, such as ""Pizzagate"".

The post by Jack Posobiec linked to a story from an ABC affiliate and said: ""Meanwhile: 39 shootings in Chicago this weekend, 9 deaths. No national media outrage. Why is that?""

The Pizzagate conspiracy theory claimed Hillary Clinton's campaign chief was running a paedophile ring out of a pizza parlour in Washington.

Mr Trump awoke for the first time as president in Trump Tower on Tuesday, tweeting that it ""feels good to be home"".

He arrived at the Manhattan skyscraper on Monday night amid throngs of protesters calling for his impeachment.

Three people were arrested, and police expect further demonstrations on Tuesday.

Late-night show hosts turned their fire on Mr Trump on Monday night.

The Tonight Show's Jimmy Fallon, who usually avoids political polemic, rebuked the president.

""The fact that it took the president two days to clearly denounce racists and white supremacists is shameful,"" Mr Fallon said on his NBC show.

Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama's response on Saturday night to the Charlottesville violence is already one of Twitter's most popular posts ever.

Quoting Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Mr Obama tweeted: ""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion...""

The tweet had more than 2.5m likes by Tuesday, making it the second most-liked tweet of all time.

Pop star Ariana Grande's post following a deadly bombing at her concert in England remains the most popular tweet of all time, with 2.7m likes.

289,"President-elect Donald Trump gave a direct order to dismiss the son of Retired General Michael Flynn from the transition team, after the young man came under fire for spreading the discredited 'Pizzagate' conspiracy theory on Twitter.

Sources told CNN's Jake Tapper that it was Trump who did the deed, after aides in the transition had reportedly requested a security clearance for Michael Flynn Jr.

This afternoon, Vice President-elect Mike Pence revised remarks he had made earlier in the day, admitting that Flynn's son was involved in transition effort and vaguely confirming that a security clearance could have gone Flynn's way.

'I said this morning that his son had no involvement in the transition,' Pence told Tapper. 'I talked to Gen. Flynn and his son was helping him a bit with scheduling and administrative items, but that's no longer the case.'

The elder Flynn is slated to become President-elect Donald Trump's national security advisor in the White House.

The younger Flynn, Mike Flynn Jr., did not endorse the conspiracy theory, but predicted that it won't go away.

'Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many ""coincidences"" tied to it,' he tweeted on Sunday.

He mentions the presidential transition's website on his Twitter biography. CNN reported that his current email address is linked with the transition.

Tapper repeatedly asked Pence about the request for a security clearance, pointing out that, as the head of the transition, he would be privy to such knowledge.

Finally, his last effort paid off with Pence answering: 'Well, what I can tell you in talking to Gen. Flynn today, he made me aware that his son was assisting him in scheduling meetings.'

'And whatever the appropriate paperwork was to assist in that regards Jake, I'm sure it was taking place,' Pence answered.

'But that's no longer the case and your viewers and the American people can be confident that we're going to drive forward,' the vice president-elect answered.

Earlier today on Morning Joe, the vice president-elect insisted that Flynn Jr. had 'no involvement' in the presidential transition – even though he has a '.gov' email address associated with the transition effort.

'General Flynn's son has no involvement in the transition whatsoever,' Pence said on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' program, adding: 'No, no he's not [involved].'

Trump spokesman Jason Miller had told reporters during a Tuesday morning conference call that 'the younger Michael Flynn was helping his father with some administration and scheduling duties early on in the process process, and he is no longer involved with transition efforts.'

These are the same duties that Pence told Tapper about later in the day.

Miller ignored a question about whether Flynn Jr. had been fired, and didn't say when the separation occured.

It suggests that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta, her presidential campaign chairman, presided over a child-sex ring run out of a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor.

Police say a 28-year-old North Carolina man opened fire with a rifle inside the restaurant on Sunday because he thought child sex-slaves were being held against their will in the basement.

No one was harmed but the man was arrested.

On Morning Joe, Pence also defended Housing and Urban Development secretary-designate Dr. Ben Carson against charges that he's unqualified and unprepared for the job.

'He is the most humble brain surgeon I've ever met in his life. He's a brilliant man who has incredible personal faith, an incredible story and character,' Pence said.

He insisted that Carson is 'absolutely qualified – and more than that. He's going to bring to life the president-elect's vision of really bringing real renewal to urban America.'

And Pence suggested that former Vice President Al Gore's meeting with Donald and Ivanka Trump on Monday doesn't indicate a softening of the president-elect's past criticism of global warming theories.

'I think he's made his position very clear on that,' he declared.",mainstream
1061,"It should be obvious by now what the plan is for Julian Assange—psychological torture resulting in either a total breakdown or an untimely death, the latter supported by the psychopaths who claim they are our leaders. This psychological torture was noted, with standard corporate media disinterest, by Nils Melzer, an internationally recognized expert on torture treatment.

“Unless the UK urgently changes course and alleviates his inhumane situation, Mr. Assange’s continued exposure to arbitrariness and abuse may soon end up costing his life,” Melzer, UN special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, said in a statement last week.

In America, the UK, and much of Europe, the financial elite and its political class consider truth-telling a cardinal sin, a crime punishable by death—not by lethal injection, but slowly and sadistically under a torture system tweaked by the CIA and put into action in rendition dungeons scattered around the world.

In fact, all of us, those who look beyond the headlines and ferret out the truth, are half a dozen steps away from suffering Julian Assange’s fate.

The national security state and its political class plan to kill Assange, keep Chelsea Manning in prison and find a way to return Snowden to the US for a show trial and life behind bars (or execution).

It must, however, first salt the earth where truth is harvested. Thousands of blogs, similar to this one, and websites contradicting and disassembling approved narratives, will be targeted for extinction.

The Mueller investigation did not result in dethroning Donald Trump. The Clinton-DNC attack on a duly elected president, however, resulted in millions of easily duped Americans believing Russia somehow meddled in the 2016 election and will do it again in 2020.

According to corporate entities in “partnership” with the state (the true nature of fascism), Russia is not alone in its supposed hatred of democracy and the self-proclaimed exceptional nation-state.

This alleged manipulation of American voters, according to the state and its corporate propaganda media, is assisted by Russian agents and a countless number of mindless dupes unaware of Vladimir Putin’s desire to destroy America.

“You can see in the current atmosphere, where anti-Russia hysteria has spread like typhoid, how readily-accepted such a notion would be by many. The reds are under our beds and the Russkies have taken over our airwaves,” wrote Daniel McAdams of The Ron Paul Institute for Peace & Prosperity wrote in 2017.

The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, rolled out the red carpet for the shadowy group, PropOrNot, and its baseless fact-devoid accusations of alternative media treason and complicity with Russia.

Bezos is working closely with the CIA on a $600 million internet-cloud deal to get the NSA, DoD, the National Reconnaissance Office, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and other government snoop-and-subvert operations interconnected.

The Alliance for Securing Democracy’s Hamilton 68 effort to destroy alternative media also has roots in the 2016 election loss of Hillary Clinton. Hamilton 68 is a project supported by the US State Department, the German Marshall Fund, and NATO. Neocon William Kristol and DNC operative John Podesta sit on its advisory board. The organization leans heavily on the Russian collusion fairy tale, thus lending to the conclusion alternative media is a Trojan horse that will help the “New Hitler” Putin destroy democracy.

I certainly don’t have a crystal ball to gaze into and read the future. However, it seems rather obvious what the outcome of all this feverish work to demonize truth-tellers and install gatekeepers on the internet will be.

First, high visibility “fake news” websites will feel the heat. This is already well underway with the persecution of Alex Jones for the crime of questioning Sandy Hook and promoting the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. Lawsuits aimed at Jones are intended to drive his operation into bankruptcy and hold him criminally responsible for questioning official narratives.

The takeaway here—questioning official narratives and positing counter-narratives is a risky business and you are advised not to engage in treasonous behavior with Russian agents if you value your freedom, ability to earn a living, and want to stay off a government terror list.

Second, the concerted effort to sanitize social media of heretical political expression is moving along at a fairly robust clip. Numerous activists and alternative websites and individuals—including the above mentioned McAdams—have been scrubbed since Hillary Clinton declared war on freedom of political expression, which she fallaciously and absurdly chalked up to malfeasance by Russia and the misbehavior of Deplorables.

Third, there will be “meddling by Russia” in the 2020 election regardless of the winner of the presidential teleprompter reader sweepstakes. This will be considered a national emergency and the floodgates will fly open to suffuse the population with scary stories of democracy lost to the autocrat Putin. Radical measures to stem the tide of subversion will be put forward and turned into law by the political class.

I have no idea what the outcome of this will be except to say many of us will be prevented from posting counter-narratives and unearthing hidden truths—historical, political, and economic. Earlier this year the FBI designated alternative media commentary as domestic terrorism.

“The FBI assesses these conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace, occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts,” the document states. It also goes on to say the FBI believes conspiracy theory-driven extremists are likely to increase during the 2020 presidential election cycle.

The FBI’s not talking about flat-earthers and UFOologists. It is targeting alternative media. The historical record—ignored by the propaganda media—of the FBI’s COINTELPRO operation to destroy political movements in the 1960s and 70s should be revisited. It is paradigmatic of the state and its subversion of opposition. For the FBI, terror is truth unshackled.

Again, I have no idea what will happen, but considering the emphasis placed on the destruction of the First Amendment—along with the Second and Fifth—and the manufactured hysteria of insidious Russian (and Chinese) subversion, and the credulity (or indifference) of the American people, it now appears the alternative media is in danger of extinction, at least on the internet.

620,"Want to know what the dark web looks like without even having to go there? A map released Tuesday by research and development outfit Hyperion Gray is bringing to life the often misunderstood and decried corner of the internet.

In what the company believes is an unprecedented effort to illuminate hidden services on the dark web, it allows anyone to zoom in and out of images containing the homepage of each website based on the Tor network. (Tor, run by the Tor Project, is designed to provide anonymity for its users and the hidden services within are considered to make up the largest section of the dark web.)

Be warned, though. The content within the Dark Web Map can be graphic. As Hyperion Gray's disclaimer notes: ""These sites include mature and/or offensive content, including pornography, violence and racism.""

The map shows 6,608 dark web sites crawled during January 2018. That includes all manner of webpages, from the amusing to the horrific. Amongst the myriad pages on the map, Forbes has already seen evidence of extreme sexual content, credit card cloning products, pictures of poop and penises, a large number of Bitcoin scams, Propublica's Tor website and a range of whistleblower pages based on the SecureDrop service. That includes Forbes' own SecureDrop service (feel free to drop us a tip securely anytime).

What's apparent from a cursory view of the map, zooming in and out of different areas, is that a significant proportion of mapped sites have been set up for illegal means, but there are also plenty of legal services such as whistleblower and personal pages. That's something Hyperion Gray CTO Alejandro Caceres (and co-founder with Amanda Towler) discovered too. ""I like Tor's narrative that the technology preserves political freedom, privacy, freedom of speech,"" he said.

""But the data clearly indicates that this is at the very least a double-edged sword. While we didn't put out this research to take a side on the debate about hidden services, it's not something that can be ignored either - there's a lot of shitty stuff out there.

""I should add that I use Tor daily for many reasons, and hidden services shouldn't be taken as the core of what the Tor project is and does."" Caceres also donates to the Tor Project.

The map was partly based on an experiment carried out with the MEMEX project at Darpa, the research arm of the Pentagon. As Forbes has previously reported, the aim of MEMEX was to create simple search engines for the dark web and had proven useful for cops investigating human trafficking.

But the digital cartography was entirely self-funded, explained Mark Haase, computer scientist at Hyperion Gray and the man behind the map. Haas started with a list of 60,000 Tor addresses, also known as onions because of their .onion extensions. He wrote a script that downloaded the home page for each and took a screenshot. About 6,600 sites responded, whilst the other 53,000 either timed out or returned errors. Haase then manually redacted any screenshots that appeared to contain illegal content, going by U.S. laws.

Users will note the clusters of different sites. They're bunched together thanks to a ""similarity algorithm"" that assigns each page a score between 0.0 and 1.0. That similarity is based on the structure of the website's code. ""The layout algorithm tries to put sites that are similar to each other close together on the map and tries to move dissimilar sites out of the way, which causes groups of similar pages to move towards each other and form into clusters,"" Haase explained to Forbes over encrypted chat. ""Two sites can be 'similar' in terms of HTML structure but contain totally different content.""

The map should provide a comprehensive view of the dark web, even if it doesn't give the entire picture. For instance, many .onion domains don't go to a webpage, but to file or chat servers. And some can be hidden, even from computer scientists who've contracted with the U.S. government. ""It's representative, but definitely not exhaustive,"" added Haase. ""If somebody really wants to hide an onion, it's very difficult for an outsider to find it.""

Haase hopes that there are two audiences for the Dark Web Map. ""First, novice users who only have a hazy idea of what 'dark web' means, maybe they can get a better sense for what it is - maybe not radically different from the open web that they already know - and a sense of what content is on it. Second, for expert users, we are planning a series of articles doing a deeper technical analysis and hopefully coming out with some novel observations about the structure of the dark web.""

""One thing i think that's interesting about this visualization is that it likely either confirms or challenges people's existing perceptions,"" Towler added. ""But the data itself doesn't have a motive. It just is what it is.""

Anyone who believes they’ve seen illegal content on the map, such as child exploitation material, should send an email to contact@hyperiongray.com with the details.

This isn't the first time Hyperion Gray has gone out looking for nasty things on the web. It previously created a search engine for sites with common vulnerabilities, dubbed PunkSpider, hoping to expose poor security across the internet.",mainstream
43,"For conspiracy theorists, ""pizzagate"" didn't end when a man brought a gun to a Washington restaurant in a misguided attempt to rescue child sex slaves. Instead, the shooting sparked discussion that the conspiracy runs deeper.

On blogs, YouTube channels and internet radio shows devoted to conspiracy theories, some see Edgar Maddison Welch's arrest as the latest ""false flag."" That's a term for a cover-up or distraction orchestrated by the government or other powerful figures.

Welch told police he drove to Comet Ping Pong pizzeria to investigate the ""pizzagate"" rumors that Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman and other Washington insiders were harboring child sex slaves there. Police said Welch fired with a military-style rifle but surrendered peacefully.

There's no evidence to back up the ""pizzagate"" rumors.",mainstream
646,"Citing its policy against posting the personal information of others, Reddit has banned the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy board from the site. Pizzagate, a persistent and popular conspiracy theory that combines the Clinton diaspora with accusations of a secret pedophile ring, has been a steady force in the enclaves of the pro-Donald Trump Internet for the past few weeks.

It has also led to some very real harassment of the people caught up in the theory, including the owner of the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in the District, James Alefantis. Alefantis has received hundreds of death threats over the past couple of weeks, he told the New York Times this week, after Pizzagate enthusiasts decided that his restaurant was the secret headquarters of a child sex-trafficking ring run by Hillary Clinton and members of her inner circle.

None of the wildly accusatory claims are true. Alefantis told the Times that he asked Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube and the FBI to help him stop the spread of the conspiracy theory, which uses photos of his own kids as ""evidence.""

For some parts of the Internet, the leak of stolen emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta provided an opportunity to scour for evidence of wrongdoing. As the Washington City Paper noted, that included a huge search for stronger ties between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the Clintons. What those sleuths found instead were lots of references to pizza, which then led to speculation that the emails about pizza must be code for something bad. The theory made its way onto r/The_Donald, the huge, Trump-supporting subreddit, until the hunt spawned its own subreddit, r/Pizzagate, which quickly attracted a dedicated team of Internet investigators.

""Pizzagate"" has yet to produce any actual evidence for its extremely weighty and life-ruining accusations, but every debunking of its claims - including the one in the Times - has only convinced its believers that they must be right, and that the circle of pedophiles and sympathizers trying to cover up their findings must be even bigger and more powerful than they imagined.

The same goes for Reddit's ban. In a post on r/The_Donald (the big subreddit dedicated to supporting Donald Trump) after the Reddit ban, one former moderator of the board dedicated to unraveling Pizzagate said that the ""entire mod team and everyone else is tightening up our opsec and putting on our battle-armor.""

""We have all made life insurance videos. We have all vowed to continue this fight. You have only increased our number. This morning we were numerous, tonight we are legion,"" they wrote, promising that the hunt would soon return to the web with a vengeance. For now, they've relocated to Voat, a popular Reddit alternative created in protest of Reddit's enforcement of its rules.

Reddit does not generally ban conspiracy theories, or the boards dedicated to them, from their site just for existing. What crossed the line with Pizzagate was the repeated posting of private information on the boards from sleuths who believed they were identifying pedophiles or those working to help them. An r/The_Donald post from a moderator asked the board to immediately report any doxxing or personal information posted there in the wake of Pizzagate's demise, to help spare their community from the same fate.",mainstream
404,"Hillary Clinton has admitted that she didn't want to go to Donald Trump's inauguration - and even tried to get out of it - in an interview at a UK book festival on Sunday.

Clinton told an audience at the Cheltenham Literature Festival that she had called George W Bush - a fellow critic of Trump in the run-up to the election - in the hopes that he wouldn't go, giving her an excuse to follow suit.

Bush Jr had agreed to attend in his position as a former President, along with wife Laura, she said - and so she and Bill had to 'suck it up' and go too.

She also slammed WikiLeaks for turning into 'an arm of Russian intelligence' by hosting Democrats' hacked emails on its site, and blamed that leak - and James Comey's reopened investigation into her emails - for losing her the election.

Clinton, who was promoting her memoir, What Happened, told interviewer Mariella Frostrup that she had attended the inauguration not as a political opponent but as a former First Lady.

'I did not want to go, Mariella. I looked for every reason not to go - we called the [younger] Bushes and said are you going?' she said, to laughter.

'The other Bushes were hospitalized - I think for real,' she added, to more chortles, 'but the younger Bushes came and the Carters came, so Bill and I sucked it up did it.

'I wrote in the book that George W Bush, who I was sitting next to, was reported to have said, ""That was some weird s**t,""' she added.

Of course, that only occurred because she lost the election, despite having, as the reminded the audience, three million more individual votes than Trump.

That was because of a lot of factors, she said - though she didn't number herself among them.

'The way that Trump as a candidate played on bigotry prejudice and paranoia was a very important motivator,' she said, but saved harsher words for WikiLeaks.

The website hosted hundreds of emails taken from the DNC and Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta, and which are believed to have been first obtained by Russians.

'[WikiLeaks,] I will say has become almost an arm of Russian intelligence, rather than an effort at at radical transparency,' Clinton fumed.

'You don't see them ever dropping anything negative about Putin and the Russians -just keep watching.'

She also blamed the Pizzagate conspiracy that rose out of the leaks, when a remark by John Podesta about going for pizza was turned into a conspiracy theory about a pedophilic sex trafficking ring under a DC pizzeria.

And she complained that 'in the Republican party, a very significant percentage of both make and female voters do not want a female president'.

But at the top of the list was James Comey's decision to reopen the investigation into her private email server, which she claims lost her the election 10 days before the vote was called.

'I don't think [Pizzagate] would have been enough, despite the Russians and the Trump's best efforts, and, who knows [Trump data firm Cambridge Analytica], and all those who were involved.

'But the Comey letter sealed it, and the cumulative impact - we still have anecdotal evidence of people saying, ""Well I couldn't vote for her after what she did at that pizzeria.""'

She did not blame herself for losing the election at any point.

Clinton complained that since coming to power, Trump has destabilized the world and America, particularly by opening up 'two nuclear confrontations at the same time' by demanding an end to the Iran deal while North Korea continues to fume.

Frostrup also brought up claims - first reported by Page Six - that Bill Clinton had told Hillary not to publish her book because she would sound 'angry' and 'bewildered'.

'My husband read every page of the book, gave me great editorial suggestions, said it was critically important to get it out,' she said.

'He was surprised that I wanted to get it out as quickly as I did, but he fully supported that.' She added that he was 'very proud' of the finished book.

In the wake of the recent claims of rape, sexual assault and harassment leveled at film producer Harvey Weinstein, Frostrup also brought up similar historical claims made against Bill Clinton.

Frostrup said that even as an admirer of Hillary Clinton's, she felt 'let down' by her because she was not 'sympathetic to the women who talked about having been hit on by your husband'.

Hillary Clinton attempted to evade the topic, saying 'that was a very difficult time during which my husband was held accountable, both personally and politically,' and that 'I'm not going to revisit it and re-litigate it.'

Frostrup pointed out that she was talking about her response, not the original charges, and Clinton evaded again, trying to focus on the wider issue.

'The stories of the women coming forward now are reminders that this is not limited to one person in one walk of life,' she said, saying that such cases are 'common' and that more support needs to be given to 'the women coming forwards.'

Frostrup pushed again, and got a similar response, with Clinton telling her to 'leave [the case] to history' and that while individual cases should judged on their own, it was more important to 'shine a bright spotlight' on the 'pattern' of abusive men.

This time, Frostrup let her go.

Clinton concluded her talk with words of support for gun control and birth control, and supporting NFL players who kneel before the anthem.

The athletes are not protesting the flag or anthem, she pointed out, but police violence against black people - and that they are kneeling, rather than turning away from the flag.

Their protest is 'perfectly legitimate,' she said. Nobody should be offended by it unless they are choosing to be offended by it and their president is telling them to be offended by it.'",mainstream

1234,"During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump frequently pointed to the press corps covering his rallies and implored them to pan the audience to show the size of the crowds he was drawing. When the cameras remained fixed on him, Trump labeled the news media “dishonest.”

One camera, however, dutifully began to pan the audience. The clunky, black Panasonic PS2 belonging to Right Side Broadcasting Network (RSBN), a year-old conservative media startup based in Alabama, made a habit of filming the teeming crowds at Trump rallies and developed a cult following in the process, with Trump supporters regularly holding up makeshift “I love RSBN” signs and seeking out the RSBN cameramen to wave. “The way to tell an RSBN camera is it moves,” says the company’s founder and CEO Joe Seales. “The rest of them stay straight.”

Starting last July, RSBN started regularly sending cameramen to film Trump rallies around the country. Today, the resulting videos, which streamed live on YouTube, have racked up a combined 116 million views, and RSBN’s YouTube channel—the most comprehensive collection of Trump political footage anywhere—boasts 244,000 subscribers, rivaling MSNBC’s 252,000, and CBS News’ 307,000. Type “right” into YouTube’s search bar and “right side broadcasting” is one of the first automatic suggestions to appear.

RSBN’s willingness to do Trump’s bidding—or its “positivity,” as Seales puts it—has won it more than just viewers. During the campaign, the Trump team gave RSBN prime real estate in press risers at rallies and a direct line to its social media team, still active today. Seales says he messages regularly with Trump’s Director of Social Media Dan Scavino (who was just named to the White House communications team), Digital Director Brad Parscale and Assistant Director of Data Analytics Avi Berkowitz, the mastermind behind the Trump campaign’s own pre- and post-debate talk show, “Trump Tower Live,” which streamed on Facebook. At Berkowitz’s request, RSBN provided the manpower and streaming expertise to produce that talk show. On Halloween, when the Trump press team decorated pumpkins for its traveling press corps, it gave RSBN’s logo equal footing with those of NBC, Fox, CBS, CNN and ABC. And next week, RSBN cameras and reporters will be at the inauguration and inaugural balls—including the so-called “Deplora-Ball,” whose guests include far-right radio host Alex Jones and former Trump adviser Roger Stone.

At the same time, the openly pro-Trump RSBN—which bills itself as a “ragtag bunch of media outsiders” seeking to deliver news to the common man—has been quietly attempting to transform itself from a small live-stream operation into a major and diverse digital media outlet, just in time to cover the Trump White House. Over the past eight weeks, the network has been hiring a lineup of conservative talk show hosts and television presenters, running the gamut from two preppy college students who urge young conservatives to get involved on their campuses to former Infowars reporter Joe Biggs, who heavily promoted the false Pizzagate rumors. On January 16, RSBN will open an office on 2nd Street SE in Washington D.C., one block from the U.S. Capitol. The network is even banking on its coziness with the Trump campaign to win it a coveted seat in the White House briefing room. “I have been told that we’re OK and they’ll get us in,” Seales says.

Already, RSBN politics reporter and on-air host Liz Willis won entry to the president-elect’s first press conference, at which Trump refused to take questions from CNN’s Jim Acosta, labeling his network “fake news.” Willis was not selected for a question either, but RSBN’s live streamed video of the event has received over 750,000 views on YouTube and was one of the site’s top “Trending” videos that day. This was helped, no doubt, by The Drudge Report’s linking to RSBN’s feed in its headline banner. “My wife is making a collage of all the Drudge headlines,” Seales says. “We’ve been on headline at least 30 times and on Drudge overall over 80 times. One time, we got the headline in red with the siren, which is like gold.”

It all makes one wonder whether liberal worries that conservative Breitbart News is fast becoming “the official propaganda arm of the Trump campaign” might be a bit premature. After all, it’s not Breitbart whose feed the Trump team chose to project on the jumbotron at a recent rally in Mobile, Alabama, or that received a public thank you from Trump social media director Dan Scavino on Twitter for playing “a major role in the success of @realDonaldTrump and @TeamTrump.”

When I visit Seales, 36, in early December at his east central Alabama studio, located behind a gas station on the border between Auburn and Opelika, Trump is still on his “Thank You Tour,” a circumstance that has sparked a mini-crisis in the office.

Trump is scheduled to give a speech at the Dow Chemical Hangar in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in five minutes and Brad Savage, RSBN’s number two cameraman—RSBN only has two cameramen, and number one is currently en route to Michigan—is calling Seales to say he’s locked out of the event. The Louisiana GOP doesn’t recognize Savage as a member of Trump’s traveling press corps, he explains over the phone to his boss.

Seales, sitting at the first of six cubicles that fill a 1,500-square-foot office adorned with framed copies of the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and a “Make America Great Again” poster, consults a second smartphone that he has pulled from the back pocket of his jeans. He explains to me that “Mr. Trump” is often late. There’s plenty of time to get a pass for Savage, a 27-year-old North Carolina native who variously worked as a firefighter, an EMT, a tow truck driver and a driver in Trump’s motorcade before he answered Seales’ plea for cameramen on YouTube. Indeed, after a few calls to the Louisiana GOP, Savage is in.

An hour later, Seales gets on the phone again. This time it’s with Berkowitz, Trump’s data guru, as the two prepare to link up RSBN’s video feed to Trump’s Facebook page. Seales is preoccupied with the poor video quality of the feed and asks his friend-turned-employee Adam Taxin, who has just walked into the studio, to lend a hand. The son of a Philadelphia-area radiologist, Taxin is the proud holder of three Ivy League degrees: an AB from Harvard and a JD/MBA from Columbia. Sporting a baseball cap emblazoned with the RSBN microphone logo and a tucked-in button-down shirt, he’s too busy perusing conservative news site Gateway Pundit (which he describes as “sloppy,” but reads anyway) to be of much help. (Taxin considers Rush Limbaugh to be the gold standard in conservative media.)

The RSBN operation, which now employs 14 full-time employees and three contractors, began in July 2015, when Seales, a stay-at-home father at the time, grew frustrated with the lack of raw Trump rally footage online. He hired a freelancer to film what became the network’s first Trump rally broadcast and posted it on YouTube. When the video quickly amassed a million views, Seales realized that there was a robust demand for pure Trump footage—a feed that wasn’t clipped or talked over by mainstream outlets. “Show the full context,” he says. “People are smart enough to make up their own mind.” That was when, borrowing from a phrase he’s fond of using—“being on the right side of history”—Seales started Right Side Broadcasting Network, originally a livestream operation airing on YouTube. He later added two call-in talk shows to the network’s YouTube channel, one hosted by conservative commentator Wayne Dupree, the other hosted by televangelist Pastor Mark Burns, a Trump surrogate.

Sensing that internet infrastructure would be important to his new venture, Seales moved his family from Pensacola, Florida, to Opelika, Alabama. (The rusting industrial town had recently spent $43 million to wire itself with super high-speed fiber optic cables.) He roped his wife into running RSBN’s back office—handling taxes and “legal stuff”—and their house quickly morphed into a full-blown news studio, with newly hired producers and on-air talent often crashing there when the evening’s work was done. In December, Seales opened a separate RSBN headquarters in Opelika. “We were growing too fast,” he says. “I had to get the dang thing out of my house.”

The expansion hasn’t been cheap. The network’s only sources of cash are YouTube ad revenue and donations from viewers. The contributions are mostly in the range of $25—though two children once sent RSBN $7 inside a handmade card that Seales considers invaluable. In October, small donations totaled $40,000, allowing RSBN to travel to each rally during Trump’s frenzied run-up to Election Day as well as to open the new studio. More recently, however, as Trump has scaled back his rally schedule, donations have started to run dry, and Seales has had to dip into his own savings.

Seales, who says he felt an obligation to RSBN’s donors to continue spreading Trump’s message regardless of who became president, doesn’t think his work is done. He wants RSBN to be the source conservatives can turn to for a break from the “pre-packaged narrative.” “We’re outsiders and we don’t know what we’re doing and to a degree that’s appealing to a lot of people who are used to stiff, scripted mainstream stuff,” he says.

The new D.C. office is part of this plan. It’s also a sizeable expense—but one that Seales hopes will pay off. Various members of Trump’s team have already promised RSBN entry to daily White House press briefings, Seales says, though he admits neither he nor Trump’s team realized how complicated fulfilling that promise actually is. (It would ordinarily require approval from the White House Correspondents' Association.) Even if RSBN does not gain access, the CEO hopes the D.C. office will be useful for conducting interviews with members of Congress. “We want to have a presence there to stay relevant,” he says. “It’s advantageous to have a base there.”

At the studio, another RSBN broadcast has just wrapped up. In it, conservative commentator Dennis Michael Lynch walked breathlessly around his native Long Island neighborhood while presenting his take on the news of the day to his front-facing smartphone camera. On this particular day, Lynch is upset about comments from the NAACP that proposed voter identification laws in Michigan would suppress minority votes. “If you can’t get yourself an ID, I don’t want your vote. You shouldn’t even be allowed to vote,” he says into the camera before allowing his alter ego to respond in a calmer voice. “DML, you’re going off the farm.” “I’m not going off the farm,” Lynch No. 1 responds. “Think about this. Seriously. These people are claiming that they don’t have the wherewithal, they don’t have the intelligence to get an identification. Seriously? It’s comments like that that hold back the black community.” Despite their low-budget production value, Lynch’s “Walk and Talk” videos routinely earned 100,000 views when he posted them on Facebook, but he was not able to monetize the attention there. In December, he signed a deal with RSBN to allow his videos to be simulcast on RSBN’s YouTube channel for a share of any ad revenue they generate.

The deal with Lynch is part of Seales’ dream of turning RSBN into the 24/7 news outlet of the common man. “It’s normal people giving normal people the news,” Seales says. When RSBN covered early reports of the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting last week, writer Steve Lookner read updates for the camera dressed in a hoodie and asked gun enthusiast Savage, dressed in a white t-shirt and winter jacket, to come out from behind the camera to give his opinions on the weapon used and the gunman’s training. The video quickly racked up nearly 64,000 views on YouTube. “If somebody killed and injured this many people that fast, does that suggest anything about the amount of ammo that might have been in there?” asks Lookner. “Well, there are what you would consider high capacity magazines that would hold, say, 14 rounds,” Savage responds, with the air of someone who regularly empties high capacity magazines at the shooting range.

Other ideas in the works include a conservative alternative to Comedy Central’s The Daily Show (for which Lookner, who has a Seinfeld credit to his name, will be responsible), short documentary films glorifying small town America and cartoons about America’s Founding Fathers intended for children. “There's a lot of issues in the way kids are being taught history,” Seales says. “It’s revisionist history. They have a negative view of the Founders. The kids need to be told the whole story.”

Other RSBN hosts with deals like Lynch’s revenue-sharing gig include the young conservative campus activists Kassy Dillon and Will Nardi, as well as the two originals—Burns and Dupree. And more hosts are coming. Former SiriusXM host Dino Costa will have a late night variety show, and former Infowars reporter Biggs is piloting a gun and outdoors show, though a recent Media Matters blog post highlighting tweets in which Biggs joked about date rape and assault may have put his chances for full-time employment at RSBN in jeopardy. “We’re learning as we go,” says Seales, who indicates that Biggs will be producing shows on a freelance basis.

There seem to be two major themes that tie the varied programming together: Patriotism and love of Trump. “I see an ungodly number of stories that are negative about Trump,” says Seales, gesturing to a television on which CNN is playing. “Why not see what Trump’s got and give him a chance?”

In RSBN’s office, pictures of the president-elect fill the desktop backgrounds. But Seales insists the network is not a propaganda outlet and says he would risk his hypothetical White House press access to prove it. “It’s not like we’re Trump super-fans and we worship him,” he says, without a trace of irony. The desktop backgrounds, according to Seales, were a practical joke hatched by his brother Jacob, who was until recently an Iowa-based guitar teacher before he was pulled into composing original music for RSBN’s videos. (The next time I visit the studio, the Trump desktop backgrounds are gone.)

“We believe in a certain set of principles,” says Seales. Those principles largely include tight borders and an insistence that immigrants be proud to assimilate into American society. Seales isn’t concerned that Trump appears to be backing away from campaign promises to have Mexico pay for a border wall. He explains that Trump is new to politics—that’s part of his appeal. Trump may have to “change course” on some campaign promises once he’s in office and has more complete information. (Even so, Seales thinks Mexico will eventually pay.)

That doesn’t mean RSBN considers itself part of the so-called “alt-right,” which Seales says he’s not sure how to define. “The white supremacists on the fringe? We disavow,” he says. “That’s why I found moderators for the chat rooms, because they’d get in there sometimes and say things and everybody would get really upset.” For a while, the sole moderator was Seales’ own mother, whose job it was to boot the foul-mouthed and racist from her son’s website and YouTube channel. Today, RSBN has 25 volunteer moderators and Mother Seales receives $200 per month to supervise them.

Seales also points to the diversity of his small team as evidence of his repudiation of the alt-right. Two of his talk show hosts are black, as is a producer. Kassy Dillon is a female millennial. And Taxin is an Orthodox Jew. “Do you not realize you’re calling people neo-Nazis who are Jewish?” asks Taxin, taking off his RSBN baseball cap to reveal a yarmulke. “Yeah, bring it on. Make me the face of the alt-right.”

Despite this diversity, ensuring that his own employees don’t tweet anything that might be considered offensive to minorities has at times been a struggle. Seales recently reprimanded Savage for suggesting on Twitter that Islam is an inherently inferior religion, as evidenced by the treatment of women and homosexuals in some Muslim countries. “That’s not what we stand for,” says Seales. “That is not how we feel at all. I am conservative, but I love everybody.”

Seales will admit that Trump has faults. He acknowledges the president-elect “said things that are very bad,” referring specifically to Trump’s comments about sexually assaulting women. But he considers Hillary Clinton’s actions worse. “They weren’t getting as much time as the ‘Trump is a sexual predator and he’s going to be in the White House’ narrative,” he tells me. Seales hasn’t been 100 percent satisfied with the transition so far, either. The selection of Betsy DeVos as Trump’s education secretary, for example, disappointed him because of her ties to a group that supports the Common Core education standards. “Maybe they talked and she’s changed her mind on it, and if so, that’s fine,” he says. “Other than that I’m pretty happy so far, and if I am unhappy I’ll let it be known.”

Indeed, as the network prepares to cover the inauguration and the pending Trump presidency, Seales insists that RSBN will cover Trump objectively.

431,"In “Bon Appétit”, Katy Perry is cooked by chefs and offered as a meal to a party of elite guests. It directly alludes to bizarre rituals the occult elite practice behind closed doors – and in plain sight.

About a week before the Bon Appétit video came out, I wrote an article entitled What is Happening to Katy Perry, where I explained how Katy Perry has been undergoing a transformative process – one that confirms that she is heavily controlled by the occult elite. Every once in a while, a specific celebrity is “chosen” to make headlines, stir up controversy and annoy the hell out of people with bizarre antics. Katy Perry is walking in the footsteps of the likes of Britney Spears, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Amanda Bynes and Kanye West, where mass media has a blast covering the strange and humiliating string of events they are involved in. Then, right on cue, the video of Bon Appétit comes out and confirms Katy Perry’s status: Industry slave.

Bon Appétit is one of those videos that leave viewers with an unpleasant aftertaste, a gut feeling that something is terribly wrong. Is it due to the overt celebration of cannibalism in the video? Of course. But also, there’s much more. The video actually depicts Katy Perry undergoing a painful process of torture, exploitation, and dehumanization. She is then used to lure others into that system.

Fans might say: “Bro, the cannibalism is a metaphor for sex bro. It’s not Illuminat-y, you don’t get it”. Bro, I get it. Everybody gets it. With lines like “Got me spread like a buffet”, even young children get it. The song is clearly about doing it with a bunch of guys. As if that alone wasn’t degenerate enough for the young viewers of the world, the video turns everything into a ritualistic, cannibalistic event.

Katy Perry is at the center of it all – she’s the pawn that is chosen to undergo the degrading, dehumanizing process of being an elite slave. The video’s allusion to her being done by a bunch of people is simply part of the process.

Let’s look at the video.

In Bon Appétit, Katy Perry is not treated like a human being, but like a piece of meat. I am not simply talking about being used for pleasure. She is treated like an actual, literal piece of meat that has no value, no soul. She is even physically abused and appears to be cool with that. It is as if she has completely dissociated from reality and was under mind control by handlers (read my article named Origins and Techniques of Monarch Mind Control if you don’t know what I’m talking about).

In my article The Hidden Life of Marilyn Monroe, the Original Hollywood Mind Control Slave, I explained that Monroe was the “prototype” of Beta Kitten Programming. Stars chosen to promote that system (like Katy Perry) are required to imitate Monroe at least one point in their career. Perry did it several times already. The flour scene, therefore, implies that the video refers to Beta Kitten programming – the creation of a Beta slave.

Sounds crazy? Of course, it does. But the elite that rules the music industry is crazy. And the next scene confirms this crazy premise.

Perry is then put through various painful situations that represent her transformation into an industry slave.

Through the scenes above, we see understand that Katy Perry’s new hairstyle is not simply about fashion – it is the end result of a transformation process that was forced on to her. In short, the above scenes represent Perry being “prepared” by MK handlers to go deeper into the elite’s system.

After that long transformative process, Katy Perry is ready to be served and consumed by the party’s elite guests.

The scene above is the seminal scene of the video. It says it all. It directly connects Perry and the entire symbolism around her with the powerful occult elite in the entertainment industry.

The table scene directly mirrors real-life events organized by one of the most powerful and influential occultists alive today in both entertainment and politics: Marina Abramovic.

This kind of stuff is not recent nor is it the exclusive domain of Abramovic. It is the kind of bizarre thing the occult elite has been obsessing about for centuries.

Therefore, to say the least, the occult elite has a thing for cannibalism. The fact that Perry mirrors these elite events confirms that she has been chosen to promote their culture of death.

However, the video doesn’t end there. There’s a twist that makes things even more upsetting.

As Katy dances like a stripper, guests at the table are tied up and abused by psychopathic chefs.

To sum up the lunacy that just happened, Katy Perry was ceremoniously used to lure people into being murdered and molested while Perry does a celebratory sexy pole dance. The guests were then cooked into a pie to be eaten by Perry.

And they sell this stuff as “empowerment”.

Judging by the great number of dislikes this video is getting on YouTube, quite a lot of people do not like this video. And those who made it were expecting that. They purposely create videos that are shocking and unnerving in order to keep pushing boundaries. The occult elite is into extreme, disgusting and horrifying practices and they are looking to normalize them all through pop culture.

The Bon Appétit video symbolically represents Katy Perry’s full transformation into a pawn of the elite by portraying her as a literal piece of meat being prepared by chefs. The dinner table scene alludes to one of the occult elite’s favorite rituals, one that highlights its complete disdain for human life. Not only is chosen Perry to reenact this ritual, but she is also used to lure more people to it. These people can easily represent fans who avidly “consume” Katy Perry and everything she does. They are lured into eating up that crap as if it was a nutritious dinner. In actuality, it is a poison that is purposely prepared to rot minds and distort souls. Bon Appétit!",conspiracy

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on a man who fired an assault weapon in a pizza restaurant while investigating an internet conspiracy theory (all times local):

A man who brought loaded guns to a family pizza parlor to investigate a fake news story about high-ranking Democratic officials trafficking children has made his first appearance in federal court in Washington.

The case of 28-year-old Edgar Maddison Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina, moved Tuesday from Superior Court in the District of Columbia to U.S. District Court, where he faces a charge of interstate transportation of a firearm with an intent to commit a crime. If convicted, he could spend up to 10 years in prison.

He appeared Tuesday afternoon before a magistrate, who set a preliminary hearing for Friday. The judge also review then whether Welch should continue to be held in custody. Welch has been in jail since the Dec. 4 shooting at Comet Ping Pong.

A North Carolina man who acted on an internet conspiracy theory by firing an assault weapon multiple times inside a pizza restaurant in the nation’s capital now faces a federal gun charge, prosecutors announced Tuesday.

Edgar Maddison Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina, is charged with interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit a crime, and local charges including assault with a dangerous weapon and property destruction have been dropped.

The federal charge carries a statutory maximum of 10 years in prison and potential financial penalties.

The 28-year-old Welch has been in jail since the Dec. 4 shooting at Comet Ping Pong, which was targeted by purveyors of fake news and falsely rumored to be the site of a child sex trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A man who police said was inspired by false internet rumors dubbed “pizzagate” to fire an assault weapon inside a Washington pizzeria pleaded guilty Friday to two charges.

Edgar Maddison Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina, said during a hearing in U.S. District Court in Washington that he had agreed to plead guilty to interstate transportation of a firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon. As part of the guilty plea, prosecutors will drop a third charge, possessing a firearm during a crime of violence, which had carried a mandatory minimum prison term of five years.

Authorities say the 28-year-old Welch fired multiple shots from an AR-15 assault rifle inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant Dec. 4, after driving from North Carolina to investigate a conspiracy theory about Democrats harboring child sex slaves there. No one was injured.

Lawyers said in court that under sentencing guidelines Welch likely faces 1 ½ to two years in prison as a result of the interstate transportation charge and 1 ½ to five years for the assault charge. Sentences on the charges could run either consecutively or concurrently. Prosecutors and Welch’s defense attorney did not say Friday what sentences they intend to ask for. Welch has also agreed to pay approximately $5,700 for damage he caused in the restaurant. Welch fired shots at a locked door after he entered and patrons fled.",mainstream
736,"Could “fake news” have helped determine the outcome of the 2016 presidential election?

Social media users and intensely partisan news broadcasts disseminated a massive number of messages during the campaign. Many of these messages demonized candidates and seriously distorted the facts presented to voters. One recent study of nearly 25,000 election social media messages shared by Michigan voters identified nearly half as “unverified WikiLeaks content and Russian-origin news stories” that fall “under the definition of propaganda based on its use of language and emotional appeals.”

What hasn’t been clear, however, is how much of an impact – if any – these “fake news” items had on the outcome of the election. To our knowledge, there have been no empirical studies that have systematically assessed the extent to which believing fake news stories influenced voting decisions in 2016. So, we set out to do one.

We are scholars associated with the Comparative National Elections Project, which is coordinated at The Ohio State University. In December 2016, we commissioned YouGov to conduct a nationwide post-election survey. Our study concludes that fake news most likely did have a substantial impact on the voting decisions of a strategically important set of voters.

The survey had 1,600 respondents. We focus our analysis on the 2016 electoral behavior of 585 respondents who had voted for Barack Obama in 2012. This strategic subset of voters was selected for two reasons.

First, restricting our analysis to former Obama supporters allowed us to weed out those respondents who were hostile to all Democratic candidates.

Second, if Hillary Clinton had retained the support of Obama voters, she would have most likely won the 2016 election. Instead, just 77 percent of Obama voters supported Clinton. Our survey data show that 10 percent of these former Obama voters cast ballots for Trump in 2016, 4 percent switched to minor parties and 8 percent did not vote.

Our key research question is: What accounts for these defections?

Our survey asked 281 questions, including three false statements best characterized as fake news – two negative statements about Hillary Clinton and one positive statement about Donald Trump. All three were widely disseminated through social media and spread by mainstream and partisan news outlets.

The first is that “Hillary Clinton is in very poor health due to a serious illness.” Twenty-five percent of all survey respondents believed that this was “definitely true” or “probably true,” as did 12 percent of our former Obama supporters.

The second is a statement that asked our respondents if they believed that “During her time as U.S. secretary of state, Hillary Clinton approved weapon sales to Islamic jihadists, including ISIS.” Thirty-five percent of our national sample believed that Clinton had sold weapons to the Islamic State, as did 20 percent of former Obama voters.

Finally, the third is a statement that “Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump for president prior to the election.” About 10 percent of our national sample and 8 percent of Obama supporters thought this statement was true.

Belief in these fake news stories is very strongly linked to defection from the Democratic ticket by 2012 Obama voters. Among respondents who didn’t believe any of the fake news stories, 89 percent cast ballots for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Sixty-one percent of those who believed one fake news item voted for Clinton. But only 17 percent of those who believed two or all three of these false assertions voted for Clinton.

To be sure, data from a one-time survey cannot “prove” that these fake news items caused former Obama voters to defect. It is also possible that someone who chose not to vote for Clinton might endorse these false statements after the fact in order to rationalize their voting decision.

We also explored a number of other possible explanations for these voters’ defections.

What else could explain these defections?

The Clinton campaign heavily emphasized gender issues in an attempt to mobilize female voters. Could this have alienated men to the extent that they abandoned their prior support for the Democratic presidential candidate? Our data provide no support for such a claim. An identical 23 percent of both male and female respondents who had voted for Obama in 2012 defected from the Democratic ticket.

Did the lack of an African-American presidential candidate lead black voters to waiver in their commitment to the Democratic candidate? No. Indeed, fewer African-American voters (20 percent) defected from Clinton than did white voters (23 percent).

Age is weakly related to defection from Clinton. While 20 percent of voters over 35 abandoned the Democratic ticket in 2016, 30 percent of younger voters did so.

Education is also weakly associated with defection. Among college-educated former Obama voters, just 16 percent did not vote for Clinton, but the percentage almost doubled to 27 percent defecting for those with lower educational attainment.

More overtly political variables had a stronger impact. Half of those who placed themselves near the conservative end of the ideological scale defected from the Democratic candidate, while only 14 percent of those on the left did so.

Similarly, dissatisfaction with the condition of the economy also had an impact: Just 12 percent of those who thought that the economic situation at the time of the survey was “good” or “very good” abandoned Hillary Clinton, while 39 percent who regarded the economy as “poor” or “very poor” at the time of the survey defected from the Democratic ticket.

Party identification exerted a stronger influence. Among the former Obama voters who identified themselves as Democrats, 7 percent did not vote for Clinton. This rose to 40 percent among independents and to 68 percent among those who identified with the Republican, Libertarian or Green parties.

So do all of these alternative factors mean it’s impossible to measure the unique impact of belief in fake news on the vote in 2016? Actually social science offers us a way. Multiple regression analysis is a tool that allows researchers to account for many different factors influencing behavior, in this case defecting from the Democratic ticket in 2016.

We used this tool to estimate the joint impact on the vote of all of these alternative explanatory factors. The first equation we ran included gender, race, age, education, ideological orientation, dissatisfaction with the condition of the economy and party identification. All together, these variables “explained” 38 percent of the likelihood of defection.

We then added the fake news items to the equation to measure their impact. The three fake news items explained an additional 14 percent of the likelihood of Obama voters defecting after the influence of all of the other variables had been taken into consideration.

We also added one more compelling element to our study. Using “feeling thermometers,” we measured how much each respondent liked or disliked Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. If defection of Obama voters was only due to disliking Hillary Clinton or liking Donald Trump, then the introduction of this thermometer variable into the equation should make the link with fake news disappear.

Though how people felt about Clinton and Trump did somewhat reduce the strength of the relationship between fake news and defection, it did not eliminate it. Belief in fake news remained a significant predictor of defecting from Clinton. In sum, even after the impact of all of these other factors is taken into consideration, former Obama voters who believed one or more of these fake news stories were 3.3 times more likely to defect from the Democratic ticket in 2016 than those who did not believe any of these false claims.

That may not seem like much, but Clinton lost the presidency by about 78,000 votes (0.6 percent of nationwide vote) cast in the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Though our evidence does not “prove” that belief in fake news “caused” these former Obama voters to defect from the Democratic candidate in 2016, our study results suggest that it is highly likely that the pernicious pollution of our political discourse by fake news was sufficient to influence the outcome of what was a very close election.",mainstream

• Vice reported Thursday on a video from April, showing a former Google employee named Zach Vorhies, detailing a campaign to send the ""Plandemic"" video viral.
• In the video, Vorhies said he ran the social media accounts for Judy Mikovits, the discredited scientist who appeared in the ""Plandemic"" video seen by millions across social platforms.
• In the past, Vorhies has worked with right-wing activist group Project Veritas, and has tweeted about QAnon and other conspiracy theories.

A recently discovered YouTube video from an ex-Google employee shows he's been crafting a campaign since April to make the ""Plandemic"" video go viral, which included running the social media accounts of Judy Mikovits.

The unlisted YouTube video, uncovered by Vice's Anna Merlan, shows Zach Vorhies telling the camera about his plan to promote claims made by Mikovits, the discredited scientist who was the star of the 26-minute documentary-style video that went viral last week on YouTube, Facebook and other platforms. Vorhies' video, posted on April 19, appeared more than two weeks before the ""Plandemic"" video was first posted online.

This video is just one part of the actions Vorhies took in April to plant the seeds ahead of the ""Plandemic"" video's debut on May 4. The video, which garnered millions of views, forwarded widely debunked coronavirus claims about social distancing making people more susceptible to get sick and the virus being man-made so vaccine manufacturers could profit. Despite Facebook and social platforms' efforts to ban the video and deal with other types of harmful content, misinformation has continued to flow freely online.

The same day he posted his YouTube video, Vorhies launched a GoFundMe campaign titled ""Help me amplify Pharma Whistleblower Judy Mikovits,"" according to The New York Times. A day earlier, a newly created Twitter account for Mikovits posted its first tweet, since deleted, to thank Vorhies ""for helping me get on Twitter!""

Both the GoFundMe page has also been deleted. The crowdfunding platform told the Times that Vorhies' fundraiser violated its policies on ""campaigns that are fraudulent, misleading, inaccurate, dishonest, or impossible.""

Both Vorhies and Mikovits were already known in conspiracy theory circles prior to this month. Mikovits has made a name for herself for speaking out against vaccinations, and published a book in April called ""Plague of Corruption."" Since her viral stardom, the book has sold out on Amazon.

Vorhies, a former software engineer at YouTube, is a self-proclaimed ""whistleblower"" who made headlines in 2019 for an interview with right-wing activist group Project Veritas where he alleged Google had an anti-conservative bias. He provided the group with over 900 pages of internal documents on Google's search algorithms as evidence.

On Twitter, Vorhies posts about a trove of conspiracy theories regarding Pizzagate and vaccines' links to autism, as well as anti-Semitic and white supremacist claims. Recently, he's focused in on posts supporting the fringe conspiracy theory QAnon.",mainstream
1072,"An online conspiracy theory dubbed “pizzagate” ended Thursday with real-world consequences when a North Carolina man was sentenced to prison for arming himself with an assault rifle, traveling to the nation’s capital and firing his weapon inside a neighborhood pizza restaurant.

Edgar Maddison Welch’s “ill-conceived plot” last year did “actual damage to the lives of real people”, a judge said before sentencing him to four years in prison.

Judge Ketanji B Jackson said she had never seen a case like Welch’s, and she gave him a punishment on the upper end of guidelines, in part to send a message to others.

If Welch believed an internet conspiracy theory that children were being harmed at the restaurant, he should have notified law enforcement, not attempted to take the law into his own hands, the judge said during Thursday’s hearing in US district court in Washington.

Jackson said it was “sheer luck” that no one was physically injured when Welch entered Washington’s Comet Ping Pong restaurant on 4 December armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and a revolver. He was there just about a month after the election of Donald Trump to investigate unfounded internet rumors about prominent Democrats harboring child sex slaves at the restaurant.

As diners and staff fled, leaving half-eaten pizza and cups of soda, Welch went through the restaurant. At one point, he fired his AR-15 at a locked closet, but he discovered there were no children being held in the restaurant and surrendered peacefully.

Welch’s sentence was just below the 4 ½ years prosecutors sought and above the 1 ½ years Welch’s attorney asked for.

During the hearing, the 29-year-old Welch spoke briefly to apologize, saying he realized that his words “cannot undo or change what already happened”. In a letter filed with the court, he wrote that he was “truly sorry for endangering the safety of any and all bystanders who were present that day”, but he didn’t talk about the conspiracy theory that motivated him to act, saying just that he came to Washington “with the intent of helping people I believed were in dire need of assistance”.

On Thursday, he sat quietly in an orange jail jumpsuit throughout most of the hearing as his mother, father, sister and fiancée sat in the front of the courtroom.

Welch’s attorney, Dani Jahn, said that Welch’s actions were “reckless” and “misguided”, but she said Welch, a father and former emergency medical technician, had acted with the intent of defending children.

Welch, who is from Salisbury, North Carolina, pleaded guilty in March to interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition and assault with a dangerous weapon. Though the rumors he went to investigate were unfounded, they have upended the lives of those who worked in the restaurant.

The restaurant’s owner, James Alefantis, said in court that the “vicious web of lies” about his business had been traumatic for him and his staff. He still needs security there, he said, and has suffered both emotionally and financially. In letters to the judge and in court, employees described the terror of Welch’s actions, with some saying they have depression and nightmares and need trauma counseling.

But Alefantis also said he was hopeful.

“I am hopeful that those who provoke fear, traffic in lies and perpetuate conspiracy will awake to the tangible harms that result from their actions,” he said in court. “I am hopeful that one day reason will prevail before a shot rings out again in a place of warmth and love and communal gathering.”",mainstream

He says rather than change the meaning of the posts, he simply redirected abuse targeted at him to the moderators of the r/the_donald thread.

His admission follows news that the site had banned a community board dedicated to discussing a conspiracy theory involving Hillary Clinton.

The ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy alleged that Hillary and her campaign chief were involved in a child abuse ring operating out of a pizza restaurant in Washington DC.

The manager of the restaurant says he has been receiving death threats and has reached out to social networks to help him stop the conspiracy theory from spreading.

""It's been a long week here trying to unwind the r/pizzagate stuff,"" Huffman said in a post on Reddit.

""As much as we try to maintain a good relationship with you all, it does get old getting called a paedophile constantly.

""As the CEO, I shouldn't play such games, and it's all fixed now.""

He said colleagues were angry with his actions and he ""most assuredly won't do this again"".

Many Reddit members were furious that the website's chief executive had edited messages, and accused him of censorship.

He left to work on online travel service Hipmunk, before returning to Reddit as chief executive last year.

Reddit users were frustrated last year after community manager Victoria Taylor was fired.

It sparked a huge protest by users of the site, with moderators closing down parts of the site and led to the chief executive at the time, Ellen Pao, resigning.

534,"Only two shows in and controversy has already hit Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly, the anchor's news magazine on her new network, NBC.

Following Sunday's announcement that Infowars founder Alex Jones will be a guest on the next program to discuss ""controversies and conspiracies,"" JPMorgan Chase & Co. requested all of its advertisements—both those on TV and digital ones—be pulled from NBC News programming until after the interview airs, the Wall Street Journal first reported.

Interviewing Jones, the far-right radio host and writer, has caused a backlash online, with protesters taking to social media with the hashtag #shameonNBC. Earlier today, JPMorgan's chief marketing officer, Kristin Lemkau, joined in, tweeting that she is ""repulsed"" that Kelly would give Jones any airtime.

Jones, who is known for his promotion of conspiracy theories, has called the Sandy Hook and Aurora shootings hoaxes promoted by those who object to the Second Amendment. Families of those killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, including Nelba Márquez-Greene and Cristina Hassinger, have criticized the network and Kelly for having him on the show and giving him a platform.

Sandy Hook Promise, a gun violence prevention organization, also broke from Kelly. She was supposed to emcee a June 14 gala for the organization.

""This decision was spurred by NBC’s planned broadcast of Kelly’s interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who believes the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT, was a hoax,” a statement rfom the organization read.

In addition to the conspiracy theory about Sandy Hook, Jones has said the September 11 attacks were an ""inside job"", helped perpetuate the Pizzagate hoax, which led to a shooting (he apologized) and spread false rumors linking yogurt brand Chobani, which was founded by a Kurdish immigrant, to sexual assault.

Even Jones, it seems, doesn't want the interview aired. He tweeted on Monday that the segment ""misrepresents"" his views on Sandy Hook, although it's not clear in what way. (In the attached video, he does say he believes children died at the massacre, but also adds that the media spun the event and used it as a way to advocate against gun ownership.)

While NBC News and NBC's advertising unit have not replied to requests for comment, Kelly has tweeted her commitment to having Jones on.

""POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light,"" she wrote in response to one critic.

On Tuesday, she issued a longer statement defending her decision. In it, she agreed that calling Sandy Hook a hoax was ""revolting,"" but that it prompted many questions that she hoped to answer in the interview.

While JPMorgan's week-long boycott is probably doing little to hurt NBC's bottom line and its finite nature makes it different than the boycott that did in Bill O'Reilly's show, this is likely not the kind of publicity NBC was hoping its nascent program would receive (though, some may say, all press is good press, particularly if Kelly pulls off a challenging interview).

NBC bet a lot—close to $20 million, a prime Sunday night spot and a daily morning hour—on Kelly when the former Fox News star switched networks to join the peacock network. So far, the ratings have been decent, but not spectacular or high enough to beat 60 Minutes, and the reviews have been rather negative.

One concern in her switch was that she'd have trouble transitioning from the right-leaning Fox News to the centrist NBC, and the Jones interview may be a hard sell to the more liberal NBC viewers. Then again, with some online, such as watchdog group Sleeping Giants, calling this a ratings ploy, perhaps the interview will bring the boost in viewers Kelly needs (albeit without at least one advertiser).",mainstream

A Senior US Intelligence official told NBC news soon after the meeting was ""always"" scheduled for Friday and Trump was ""mistaken.""

Intelligence agents believe Russian hackers, under orders from the Kremlin, stole emails belonging to John Podesta, Hillary Clinton 's campaign chief.

The emails were later published by Wikileaks.

But last night, in an interview with Fox News, Assange told Trump-supporting news anchor Sean Hannity the Russian government were not his source for the emails.

Today, Donald Trump quoted Assange, saying a ""14 year old"" could have hacked Podesta's emails, before adding: ""Also said Russians did not give him the info!""

He added: ""More dishonest than anyone knows.""

The emails highlighted details of paid speeches made by Hillary Clinton to Wall Street figures that staffers believed could have been problematic to her campaign.

They also appeared to reveal CNN anchor Donna Brazile had shared a question from the second Presidential TV debate with the clinton campaign ahead of time, which Brazile repeatedly denied.

Conspiracy theorists seized upon discussions of a Washington DC Pizza restaurant - Comet Ping Pong, a regular haunt of DC insiders - which they falsely claimed was evidence Clinton staffers were speaking in code and were involved in a child sex abuse ring based in the restaurant's basement.

The bizarre theory - which became known as 'pizza-gate' - climaxed when a man turned up to Comet Ping Pong with an automatic rifle, saying he was 'self-investigating' the conspiracy.

Edgar Maddison Welch stormed into the restaurant with an AR-15 rifle, terrorising customers, shooting into the floor and demanding to see the basement.

He eventually surrendered to police after being informed the restaurant had no basement.

This morning, former Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin said: ""This important information that finally opened people's eyes to Democrat candidates and operatives would not have been exposed were it not for Julian Assange.""

Palin apologised to Assange for a 2010 outburst in which she accused Assange of being an ""anti-American operator with blood on his hands.""",mainstream
380,"Despite Washington Post admitting its “fake news” exposé was based on shoddy research

Facebook is already blocking links to so-called “fake news” stories, despite the Washington Post being forced to admit that its own definitive article on “fake news” was based on shoddy research.

A Twitter user revealed how he tried to post an Alex Jones Channel video about ‘PizzaGate’ on Facebook but was blocked from doing so because Facebook characterized the YouTube link as “unsafe”.

This suggests that more than just blocking alleged “fake news” websites, Facebook is censoring certain topics from being posted altogether.

The social network giant also appears keen to comply with a European Union demand that all “fake news,” which was listed on a par with hate speech and jihadist propaganda, be censored within 24 hours.

As we reported yesterday, after pressure from academics, Google is also de-listing information pertaining to criticism of Islam and information about black people being overrepesented in crime figures (which is an objective fact).

The notion of social media websites blocking content they arbitrarily decide to be “fake news” is chilling, especially given that the Washington Post has now been forced to admit that its vaunted “fake news” exposé was itself fake after massive blowback.

“A lengthy editor’s note appeared on top of the original article in which the editor not only distances the WaPo from the “experts” quoted in the original article whose “work” served as the basis for the entire article (and which became the most read WaPo story the day it was published) but also admits the Post could not “vouch for the validity of PropOrNot’s finding regarding any individual media outlet”, in effect admitting the entire story may have been, drumroll “fake news” and conceding the Bezos-owned publication may have engaged in defamation by smearing numerous websites – Zero Hedge included – with patently false and unsubstantiated allegations,” reports Zero Hedge.

Given that the first list of “fake news” websites was also completely debunked as the bias-driven musings of a far-left social justice warrior, what credibility does the mainstream media have left in lecturing everyone else as to what constitutes “fake news”?

Get the REAL list of fake news websites right here.

866,"As social media executives and policy makers puzzle over how to respond to the most recent upsurge of fake news, they occupy well-trod historical ground. The dilemmas around how to define deceptive speech and how to check rank duplicity bedevil every modern capitalist society.

Past efforts suggest both key actions to consider and some cautions about how hard the task will be.

The most effective approach depends on a combination of meaningful self-regulation by the business community, innovative fraud policing and the willingness of political leaders and media elites to stand up for truthful public communication. At the moment, perhaps because of the extent to which Americans have come to disagree about what counts as “truth,” each of these requirements seems in short supply.

Anti-fraud efforts have an especially rich history in the United States, connecting such disparate topics as adulterated fertilizers, bogus patent medicines, and fly-by-night mail order firms, endemic investment swindles and bait-and-switch consumer advertising, and, more recently, telemarketing scams and misleading sales pitches for debt products like residential mortgages.

Every generation, Americans relearn that deceptive business practices not only harm investors and consumers, but also hurt honest firms and undermine broader economic confidence. What then to do about it?

One recurring impulse has been to deny the worst liars access to the marketplace. After the Civil War, the American Post Office Department invented the fraud order, which tackled the problem of deceptive long-distance marketing by denying allegedly duplicitous firms access to the mails. In the early 20th century, the new network of Better Business Bureaus began to circulate suggestions to newspapers and magazines that ads from especially dodgy marketers were “not in the public interest.” More recently, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have collaborated on Operation Chokepoint, which has denied sellers of bogus goods and services access to the online payment system.

The problem of fake news has prompted analogous countermeasures, this time implemented by social media companies like Facebook FB, and Google GOOG, GOOGL, . These companies have banned the producers of phony news accounts from using their online advertising services.

Efforts to cast out commercial fabricators from the marketplace have the big advantage of immediate, quick impact. But America’s history of anti-fraud regulation suggests important limitations as well. There is the whack-a-mole problem, since cheats and deceivers often respond to fraud orders and similar tactics by relaunching businesses under different names.

Such summary modes of dispensing justice also clash with American commitments to the rule of law, and so prompt complaints about exercises of raw power that seem more consistent with autocratic regimes. Faced with such critiques, most anti-fraud agencies eventually create procedural protections against unfair treatment: notice of impending bans from access to the marketplace, access to incriminating evidence and an opportunity to mount a defense through formal hearings.

The resulting reforms (in the 1910s and 1920s for mail fraud orders, in the 1950s and 1960s for Better Business Bureau recommendations that media outlets shun specific advertisers) made anti-fraud enforcement fairer. But they did so at the cost of slowing down enforcement actions and diminishing their effects.

The history of American anti-fraud policing suggests there is no magic bullet to the endemic problem of deception in the marketplace or the public square. Criminal prosecutions of the worst offenders can make a difference, though constitutional protections for free speech and the global reach of the internet complicate this potential means of curbing fake news.

Well-conceived public education may be even more important, whether undertaken by government agencies, NGOs or the media. Another emerging strategy to curb bogus news emphasizes this approach. The idea is to rely on crowdsourced tagging on social media of stories as “disputed,” along with work by journalistic gatekeepers to adjudicate such allegations.

Read:The next conversation about fake news needs to be this one

As this example suggests, we will never escape the need to invest trusted arbiters with the authority to label some deceptive practices as illicit. And unless we are willing to tolerate draconian regulatory actions, we will never banish duplicity entirely from our economic or political life.

Our best option is to tailor laws and design institutions with the goal of containing fakery and fraud, an objective that depends as much on the operation of social norms and shaming techniques as it does on formal penalties and the cultivation of savvier consumers of products, investment pitches and news.

This approach is far from perfect. But it can limit the impact of deceitful speech, and so the corrosive threats to our economy and our democracy.

 POTUS will not go on tv to address nation.

 POTUS must isolate himself to prevent negative optics.

 POTUS knew removing criminal rogue elements as a first step was essential to free and pass legislation.

 Who has access to everything classified?

 Do you believe HRC, Soros, Obama etc have more power than Trump? Fantasy.

 Whoever controls the office of the Presidecy controls this great land.

 They never believed for a moment they (Democrats and Republicans) would lose control.

 This is not a R v D battle.

 Why did Soros donate all his money recently?

 Why would he place all his funds in a RC?

 Mockingbird 10.30.17

Open your eyes.

 It finally came out that Rod/Bob were key players in the Uranium scandal.

 Don’t you think POTUS would be tweeting about removal given clear conflict.

 Why did POTUS meet Bob under the cover of FBI Dir interview?

 Bob is unable to serve as Dir per the law.

 Trust in your President.

 God bless, Patriots

Some of us come here to drop crumbs, just crumbs.

 POTUS is 100% insulated – any discussion suggesting he’s even a target is false.

 POTUS will not be addressing nation on any of these issues as people begin to be indicted and must remain neutral for pure optical reasons. To suggest this is the plan is false and should be common sense.

 Focus on Military Intellingence/ State Secrets and why might that be used vs any three letter agency

 What SC decision opened the door for a sitting President to activate – what must be showed?

 Why is POTUS surrounded by generals ^^

 Again, there are a lot more good people than bad so have faith. This was a hostile takeover from an evil corrupt network of players (not just Democrats).

 Don’t fool yourself into thinking Obama, Soros, Roth’s, Clinton’s etc have more power present day than POTUS.

Why wasn’t HRC prosecuted for the emails? Put simply, Obama ultimately OK’d by using the non govt email addy to communicate w/ Clinton. Obama also had an alias along with each of his cabinet members. Therefore indicting HRC would lead to indicting Obama & his cabinet etc which could never happen. Remember he lied about knowing but that ultimately came out in the dump. Poof!

 RE: Military Intelligence / State Secrets

 No FBI

 POTUS installed his people within each top spot at each 3 letter agency except 1 (good reason there as Adm R kick started this and scrubbed all POTUS nominations to verify oath).

 Do you think they aren’t in control of those respective agencies?

 What is most valuable?

 Information

 AG Sessions on leakers.

 Fire or prosecute?

 Reorg is underway and happening.

 Coincidence Senate Republicans pushing for Fed Judge confirmations last week?

 Why are Senate Republicans dropping out? Not by choice and were offered a choice (rest assured they will vote pro Trump).

Projection

 D’s can’t lose control over the black population.

 At some point the great awakening will occur whereby these false local / national black leaders are corrupt and paid off to help keep the black pop poor and in need.

 D’s formed the confederate states against freeing slaves.

 D’s formed the KKK.

 HRC’s mentor is who?

 What happens if the truth about Haiti is released? Do D’s lose majority of the vote?

 Through the looking glass.

 They rely on the MSM to keep the narrative going but tech is entrenching on their controls. They missed this in 2016 and desperately attempting to censor now due to CIA cash infusions. This will fail.

Remember, the FBI, and MI, have an open investigation into the CF. Why did Comey drop this? Who was the FBI director during the Haiti crisis? How many kids disappeared? How much money sent to CF under disguise of H relief went to H? What countries donated big money to CF and why? How much was owed by accepting? When she lost how would this be repaid? What did Obama do with cash just prior to leaving office? Repayment to those who donated for favors/access? Dig!!!!!

 Again, good people were forced into bed with this evil under personal and family threats. Could you live with yourself helping to cover up such evil despicable acts if given a safe way out? These people worship Satan _ some openly show it.

Key:

 Military Intelligence v FBI CIA NSA

 No approval or congressional oversight

 State Secrets upheld under SC

 Under what article can the President impose MI take over investigations for the 3 letter agencies? What conditions must present itself? Why is this so VERY important? Who surrounds POTUS? They lost this very important power _ the one area of the govt not corrupt and directly serves POTUS.

Military Intelligence ref above is the absolute biggest inside drop this board will ever receive.

 Now think about why Antifa plays right into the plan? Always ahead. Good guys are winning.

Now think about the timing of POTUS traveling to China/SK. I’ve said too much. God bless, Patriots.

There are more good people than bad. The wizards and warlocks (inside term) will not allow another Satanic Evil POS control our country. Realize Soros, Clintons, Obama, Putin, etc. are all controlled by 3 families (the 4th was removed post Trump’s victory).

 11.3 – Podesta indicted

 11.6 – Huma indicted

 Manafort was placed into Trump’s camp (as well as others). The corruption that will come out is so serious that deals must be cut for people to walk away otherwise 70% of elected politicians would be in jail (you are seeing it already begin). A deep cleaning is occurring and the prevention and defense of pure evil is occurring on a daily basis. They never thought they were going to lose control of the Presidency (not just D’s) and thought they had control since making past mistakes (JFK, Reagan).

 Good speed, Patriots.

 PS, Soros is targeted.

Get the popcorn, Friday & Saturday will deliver on the MAGA promise. POTUS knows he must clean house (gov’t) in order to ‘free up’ and demonstrate who has authority in order to pass important legislation. This was always the priority. Remember, AG Sessions cannot look like an impartial player that is out to get all former Obama team members as we need him for other important work. All will come into focus and for anyone to think POTUS is not in control is kidding themselves. Also, he’s 100% insulated with zero risk of impeachment (fact).

Why does Obama travel in advance of POTUS to foreign locations?

 Why is this relevant?

 Focus on the power of POTUS as it relates to the Marines.

 How can MI be applied to prosecute bad actors and avoid corrupt agencies and judges?

 Biggest drop on Pol.

 Above is reason why the shills are sliding. In case you didn’t know, shills log and send new info back to ASF for instruction. They use a 5 prong pre packaged injection (one post auto generates four more at random designated times). Common drive of posts they all tap into. Since they misjudged the influence of the MSM they are aggressively looking to censor throughout major platforms in exchange for CIA slush funds and WW access for expansion of said networks. Everything they do has been forecasted and prepared for.

Why do D’s want to control the black pop?

 Why do they intentionally keep poor and in need?

 Why do D’s project racism on a daily basis against R’s?

 Why do black elected officials do the crazy talk on behalf of D’s?

 How do D’s cover the historical facts of forming the confederacy, KKK, and oppose all things pro black re: legislation?

 What happens if D’s lose the slave grip on the black pop?

 Why do D’s, through the funding of the CIA, prop up and install Hollywood/media assets?

 Does this fall within Operation Mockingbird?

 What were the historical advantages D’s gained by having MSM and famous people peddling narrative?

 Who exposed the pedo network within H wood?

 You can’t answer the above but will laugh once disclose details.

 The network which controls this false narrative which in turns keeps the black pop under control is being dismantled.

 False local and national black leaders will be exposed next as shills for the D party.

 Follow the money.

 Maxine W has a $4mm home and cash assets in excess of $6mm.

 How is that possible? One example.

 All of these questions help to paint the full picture.

Who did POTUS meet with yesterday?

 Was AG Sessions there?

 How many MI generals were on the WH list to attend a separate meeting?

 Could those meetings have been combined?

 Why were certain rooms in the WH renovated?

 Where was the meeting on Monday?

 Why aren’t phones allowed in this room (one of many).

 What firm was contracted to conduct the renovations?

I’ve dumped some crumbs like this over the weekend which started the intense shilling. At this point we are far enough along you can paint the picture without risk of jeopardizing the operation.

Who controls the NG?

 Why was the NG recently activated in select cities within the US?

 Can the NG work in coordination w/ the marines?

 Do conditions need to be satisfied to authorize?

 What former President used the military to save the republic and what occurred exactly?

 Biggest drop to ever be provided on Pol. Study and prepare. The masses tend to panic in such situations. No war. No civil unrest. Clean and swift

Note MI has the same SAPs as NSA, CIA etc as designated post 9-11.

 Why is this relevant?

 Who can be held hostage and controlled?

 CIA thinks its foreign offshore assets are strong enough to defend against the US executive (not accounting for military use on domestic soil).

 Why does the Constitution explicitly grant this authority to the President and what is it to prevent?

 They knew our agencies would grow in power so much so they could/can hold the executive hostage or engage with bad actors.

 Trump nominated someone new to direct every agency but one. He controls the top.

Any person making statements they will not be seeking re-election was put in submission. For the betterment of the country not all will be prosecuted and all will do as told. You will see more of this occur (not normal yet disregarded) and even on the D side.

Follow up to last post.

 Return to comments re: Pelosi and John M (some of us refuse to say his last name for a reason).

 This all has meaning – everything stated. Big picture stuff – few positions allow for this direct knowledge.

 Proof to begin 11.3.

 We all sincerely appreciate the work you do. Keep up the good fight. The flow of information is vital.

 God bless.

Think about it logically.

 The only way is the military. Fully controlled. Save & spread (once 11.3 verifies as 1st marker).

 Biggest advanced drop on Pol.

What must be completed to engage MI over other (3) letter agencies

 During the 1950s and 60s, federal troops and federalized National

 Guard forces, accompanied by military intelligence personnel, were

 deployed to help integrate Southern schools23 and to help deal with

 civil disorders in Detroit in 1967 and other cities the following year

 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.24 Throughout

 this period military intelligence units also continued to collect data on

 Americans at home who were suspected of involvement in subversive

 activities.25 In the late 1960s, the Pentagon compiled personal

 information on more than 100,000 politically active Americans in an

 effort to quell civil rights and anti-Vietnam War demonstrations and

 to discredit protestors.26 The Army used 1,500 plainclothes agents to

 watch demonstrations, infiltrate organizations, and spread

 disinformation. 2

 ‘ According to one report, the Army had at least one

 observer at every demonstration of more than twenty people.28

 The Army’s activities were summed up by Senator Sam Ervin:

 Allegedly for the purpose of predicting and preventing

 civil disturbances which might develop beyond the control of

 state and local officials, Army agents were sent throughout

 the country to keep surveillance over the way the civilian

 population expressed their sentiments about government

 policies. In churches, on campuses, in classrooms, in public

 meetings, they took notes, tape-recorded, and photographed

 people who dissented in thought, word, or deed. This included clergymen, editors, public officials, and anyone who

 sympathized with the dissenters.

 >Hahahaha, Trump has had MI infiltrate Antifa and all the dissenting local govts.

 Always 5 steps ahead!

 Please be true.

Not everything can be publicly disclosed because so much ties back to foreign heads of state. Much will be revealed, we want transparency but not at a cost we can’t recover from.

Some things must remain classified to the very end. NK is not being run by Kim, he’s an actor in the play. Who is the director? The truth would sound so outrageous most Americans would riot, revolt, reject, etc.

 The pedo networks are being dismantled.

 The child abductions for satanic rituals (ie Haiti and other 3rd world countries) are paused (not terminated until players in custody).

 We pray every single day for God’s guidance and direction as we are truly up against pure evil.

Would you believe a device was placed somewhere in the WH that could actually cause harm to anyone in the room and would in essence be undetected?

 Fantasy right?

 When Trump was elected you can’t possibly imagine the steps taken prior to losing power to ensure future safety & control.

 When was it reported Trump Jr dropped his SS detail?

 Why would he take that huge risk given what we know?

 I can hint and point but cannot give too many highly classified data points.

 These keywords and questions are framed to reduce sniffer programs that continually absorb and analyze data then pushed to z terminals for eval. Think xkeysc on steroids.

World stalemate.

 We all have the goods on everyone else.

 That’s part of the reason why some things that tie back to foreign heads of state will remain classified (not all).

 We are in one of the most critical times of our country. Trump and others are working to balance the we’re doing well for America (for the common person to endorse) while at the same time purify our govt and remove the bad actors who are entrenched. There is so much string pulling and blackmail that we need to cut these off to truly gain the power granted to us by the Patriots and hard working people of this great country.

Maybe one day but it cannot go slow. The initial wave will be fast and meaningful. It will send a signal to others immediately and you’ll see the tide turn (not even the MSM can hide and rest assured some will be jailed as deep cover agents).

I’m hopeful my time spent here was not wasted.

 Note few if any shills inside this thread. Reason for that. It’s being monitored, recorded, and analyzed and don’t want the clutter.

 Take good care. God bless.

Q Clearance Patriot

 My fellow Americans, over the course of the next several days you will undoubtedly realize that we are taking back our great country (the land of the free) from the evil tyrants that wish to do us harm and destroy the last remaining refuge of shining light. On POTUS’ order, we have initiated certain fail-safes that shall safeguard the public from the primary fallout which is slated to occur 11.3 upon the arrest announcement of Mr. Podesta (actionable 11.4). Confirmation (to the public) of what is occurring will then be revealed and will not be openly accepted. Public riots are being organized in serious numbers in an effort to prevent the arrest and capture of more senior public officials. On POTUS’ order, a state of temporary military control will be actioned and special ops carried out. False leaks have been made to retain several within the confines of the United States to prevent extradition and special operator necessity. Rest assured, the safety and well-being of every man, woman, and child of this country is being exhausted in full. However, the atmosphere within the country will unfortunately be divided as so many have fallen for the corrupt and evil narrative that has long been broadcast. We will be initiating the Emergency Broadcast System (EMS) during this time in an effort to provide a direct message (avoiding the fake news) to all citizens. Organizations and/or people that wish to do us harm during this time will be met with swift fury – certain laws have been pre-lifted to provide our great military the necessary authority to handle and conduct these operations (at home and abroad).

POTUS will be well insulated/protected on AF1 and abroad (specific locations classified) while these operations are conducted due to the nature of the entrenchment. It is time to take back our country and make America great again. Let us salute and pray for the brave men and women in uniform who will undertake this assignment to bring forth peace, unity, and return power to the people.

 It is our hope that this message reaches enough people to make a meaningful impact. We cannot yet telegraph this message through normal methods for reasons I’m sure everyone here can understand. Follow the questions from the previous thread(s) and remain calm, the primary targets are within DC and remain at the top (on both sides). The spill over in the streets will be quickly shut down. Look for more false flags – stay alert, be vigilant, and above all, please pray.

 “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Love is patient, love is kind.”

 God bless my fellow Americans.

 How does Soros, Obama, Clinton, Holder, Lynch, etc all net many millions of dollars (normally within a single tax year).

 What was negotiated on the tarmac between BC and Lynch?

 Remember it was expected HRC was going to win during this time period.

 What if the wizards and warlocks tipped off a local reporter as to the supposed unscheduled stop?

 What if the NSA under the personal direction from Adm R had this meeting miscat and logged under a false identity to prevent bad actors from locating while also verifying to said players all was clear _ no logs.

 What really happened when the wizards and warlocks revealed what they had?

 Was Comey forced into the spotlight shortly thereafter not by choice? Right before the election no doubt which would cast suspicion?

 These are crumbs and you cannot imagine the full and complete picture.

 If Trump failed, if we failed, and HRC assumed control, we as Patriots were prepared to do the unthinkable (this was leaked internally and kept the delegate recount scam and BO from declaring fraud).

 Dig deeper – missing critical points to paint the full picture.

 There is simply no other way than to use the military. It’s that corrupt and dirty.

 Please be safe and pray for those in harms way as they continually protect and serve our great country.

They are the true Patriots. We will never forget. Let these coming days be remembered in our history as the time we fought to recapture the republic from those evil bad actors who for so long have sacrificed the good people of this land for their own personal gain.

 Fight the good fight.

 LET JUSTICE BE SERVED.

Four carriers & escorts in the pacific?

 Why is that relevant?

 To prevent other state actors from attempting to harm us during this transition? Russia / China?

 Or conversely all for NK? Or all three.

 Think logically about the timing of everything happening.

 Note increased military movement.

 Note NG deployments starting tomorrow.

 Note false flags.

 Follow Huma.

 Prepare messages of reassurance based on what was dropped here to spread on different platforms.

 The calm before the storm.

What a coincidence the mountain that housed NK’s nuclear weapons and testing collapsed. Unbelievable timing. I wonder if critically important materials as well as scientists aka the bomb makers were inside when it happened. Shocking no global news agency suspects we had nothing to do with it. Enjoy the crumbs.

We serve at the pleasure of the President. DJT

839,"Residents in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood are upset over fliers that claim the so-called ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theory is real.

NBC4 Washington reported Sunday that the fliers showed up in the Tenleytown neighborhood where a man fired a gun inside a pizza restaurant last year.

Edgar M. Welch said he wanted to investigate wild online claims of a child sex ring at Comet Ping Pong. The North Carolina man was sentenced to four years in prison.

The fliers were placed on fences and doors and called for the conspiracy theory to be reinvestigated. Residents said they were feeling ""rage, anger and disgust.""

The fliers turned up sometime between Wednesday night and Thursday morning. At least one neighbor called police.",mainstream
1150,"One of Donald Trump's aides has lost his job after fanning a conspiracy theory that climaxed at the weekend in gunfire at a pizzeria.

Michael Flynn, 33, left the US president-elect's transition team on Tuesday following his tweets about the so-called Pizzagate fake news story.

His father, Michael Flynn Snr, Mr Trump's pick to be US national security adviser, has also shared viral hoaxes.

The Pizzagate claims led to a gunman firing shots in a restaurant on Sunday.

No one was injured in the incident at Comet Ping Pong in Washington DC.

The suspect told police he had turned up to ""self-investigate"" online rumour-mongering that the pizzeria was the nexus of a paedophile ring involving Hillary Clinton and one of her aides, John Podesta.

The bizarre and unfounded theory had been spread online by right-wing blogs.

The allegations were also circulated by Mr Flynn Jr, who tweeted after Sunday's gunfire that Pizzagate would remain a story until ""proven to be false"".

The New York Times reports that he was fired from the Trump transition team on Tuesday but, according to CBS News, he resigned before he was sacked.

The Trump team confirmed the departure of Mr Flynn - who had reportedly been given a .gov email address - but did not confirm it was related to the tweets.

Vice President-elect Mike Pence acknowledged that Mr Flynn Jnr had been helping his father with scheduling and administrative items during the transition but said ""that's no longer the case"".

Asked repeatedly whether a security clearance was requested, Mr Pence refused to answer directly.

Mr Flynn Snr, 57, has also tweeted out outlandish conspiracy theories accusing Mrs Clinton and her aides of child-sex trafficking.

Among the retired lieutenant general's other tweets was an allegation that President Barack Obama was a ""jihadi"" who ""laundered"" money for terrorists.

Critics have said Mr Flynn Snr is unfit to advise the incoming president on the veracity of national security threats facing the US.

In Sunday's armed confrontation, the suspect allegedly walked into Comet Ping Pong and pointed a rifle at an employee before firing shots into the ground.

Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, from North Carolina, has been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon.

The Pizzagate theory originated on alternative message board 4chan, based on emails hacked from the Democratic Party and leaked by Wikileaks.

The restaurant's owner, James Alefantis, a Democratic Party donor, appears in the emails in relation to organising a Democratic fundraiser.

Users of 4chan and another message board, Reddit, had said words in the emails such as cheese, hot dog, and pizza were code for young children and sex acts.",mainstream
1293,"A BBC team tracking coronavirus misinformation has found links to assaults, arsons and deaths. And experts say the potential for indirect harm caused by rumours, conspiracy theories and bad health information could be much bigger.

""We thought the government was using it to distract us,"" says Brian Lee Hitchens, ""or it was to do with 5G. So we didn't follow the rules or seek help sooner.""

Brian, 46, is talking by phone from his hospital bed in Florida. His wife is critically ill - sedated, on a ventilator in an adjacent ward.

""The battle that they've been having is with her lungs,"" he says, voice wobbling. ""They're inflamed. Her body just is not responding.""

After reading online conspiracy theories, they thought the disease was a hoax - or, at the very least, no worse than flu. But then in early May, the couple caught Covid-19.

""And now I realise that coronavirus is definitely not fake,"" he says, running out of breath. ""It's out there and it's spreading.""

A BBC team has been tracking the human toll of coronavirus misinformation. We've investigated dozens of cases - some previously unreported - speaking to the people affected and medical authorities in an attempt to verify the stories.

The effects have spread all around the world.

Online rumours led to mob attacks in India and mass poisonings in Iran. Telecommunications engineers have been threatened and attacked and phone masts have been set alight in the UK and other countries - all because of conspiracy theories.

And in Arizona, a couple mistakenly thought a bottle of fish tank cleaner contained a preventative medicine.

It was late March when Wanda and Gary Lenius started to hear about hydroxychloroquine.

The couple noticed a similar-sounding ingredient on the label of an old bottle that was lying around their house in Phoenix.

Hydroxychloroquine may have potential to fight the virus - but as research continues, it remains unproven. On Monday, the World Health Organisation halted its use in trials after a recent study suggested it could actually increase the risk of patients dying from Covid-19.

Speculation about its effectiveness started circulating online in China in late January. Media organisations, including Chinese state outlets, tweeted out old studies where it was tested as an anti-viral medicine.

Then a French doctor claimed encouraging results. Although doubt was later cast on that study, interest in hydroxychloroquine surged. It was mentioned, with various degrees of scepticism, by a variety of media outlets and influential people including Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.

It also found its way into White House press briefings - and President Trump's Twitter feed.

""What do you have to lose?"" he said on 3 April. ""Take it."" In mid-May, he went further - saying that he'd been following his own advice. Each comment resulted in big spikes in social media chatter about the drug, according to data from online monitoring tool CrowdTangle.

Overdoses of the drug are rare, but the anxiety produced by the pandemic has driven people to extreme measures.

In Nigeria, hospital admissions from hydroxychloroquine poisoning provoked Lagos state health officials to warn people against using the drug.

And in early March, a 43-year-old Vietnamese man was admitted to a poison control clinic in Hanoi after taking a large dose of chloroquine. He was red, trembling and unable to see straight. The clinic's director, Dr Nguyen Trung Nguyen, said the man was lucky he received treatment quickly - or else he might have died.

Gary Lenius was not so fortunate. The cleaner he and Wanda gulped down contained a different chemical, and was poisonous.

Within minutes, both started feeling dizzy and hot. They vomited and struggled to breathe. Gary died, and Wanda was hospitalised.

Wanda later explained why the couple drank the concoction.

""Trump kept saying it was pretty much a cure,"" she said.
• The people fighting viral fakes from their sofas

In Iran, authorities say hundreds have died from alcohol poisoning after viral rumours about its curative effects.

The total was put at 796 by the end of April by Kambiz Soltaninejad, an official from Iran's Legal Medicine Organisation, who said it was the result of ""fake news on social media.""

The truth behind the number is murky in a country where alcohol is banned in Iran and bootleg moonshine is routinely contaminated.

However in this case, BBC journalists did see rumours of the supposed ""cure"" spreading on the messaging app Telegram before the official announcement.

Shayan Sardarizadeh of BBC Monitoring's disinformation team notes that the announcement was potentially embarrassing to the Iranian authorities and, if anything, the number could be an underestimate.

In one case we verified, a 5-year-old boy went blind after his parents plied him with illegal booze in an attempt to fight the disease.

""We know that bad information can ruin lives,"" says Clare Milne, deputy editor of UK fact-checking organisation Full Fact. ""There's such great potential for harm.""

President Trump has speculated on a number of other cures beside hydroxychloroquine. In late April, he opined that ultraviolet rays could neutralise the virus.

""And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?""

Trump later said his comments were sarcastic. But some Americans didn't see it that way, and poison control hotlines received calls asking about the advice. Officials at one in Kansas said they heard from someone who said his friend swallowed disinfectant soap after the president's briefing.

Dr Duncan Maru, a doctor at Elmhurst Hospital in New York, says his colleagues have treated patients who have become acutely ill after ingesting disinfectant.

""These ingestions also can have long-term consequences, like cancers and gastrointestinal bleeding,"" he says.

Social networks have also been fertile ground for conspiracy theories. One particular coronavirus-related one - there are many circulating online - has resulted in arsons and assaults.

Across the UK, more than 70 phone masts have been vandalised because of false rumours that 5G mobile phone technology is somehow to blame for the virus.
• Sandy Hook to Trump: 'Help us stop conspiracy theorists'

In April, Dylan Farrell, an engineer for Openreach, was driving his van in Thurmaston near Leicester. It had been a long day and he was thinking about what he might have for tea as he pulled up to a roundabout. That's when he started to hear shouting.

At first, he thought it was directed at someone else. But when he heard ""5G!"" being screamed through his passenger side window, he realised the shouting was meant for him.

""You've got no morals!"" a man shouted. ""5G is killing us all!""

""I have no doubt he would have tried to get inside and physically attack me had I not locked the doors straight away,"" Dylan says. ""It was so frightening.""

He drove away quickly. There have been no arrests in connection with the incident.

""We've seen a lot of conspiracies which have been online for a long time now about 5G,"" says Claire Milne of Full Fact. ""Those have evolved to be connected to the new coronavirus.""
• No, 5G does not spread coronavirus

In March, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the pandemic would lead to a flare up of a ""dangerous enemy"".

He was referring to racism against people from Asia and China, but the virus has exacerbated tensions in several countries.

In April, three Muslim men were violently attacked in separate incidents in Delhi. They were beaten up after rumours circulated that Muslims were spreading the virus.

In Sisai, a small village in eastern India, rival gangs clashed. It came after an attack on a Muslim boy, again linked to false rumours suggesting Muslims were spreading disease. One young man lost his life and another was seriously injured.

False reports have circulated within ethnic communities as well. In Bradford, England, rumours circulated that non-white patients were being left to die.

And in Indore, a city in west-central India, doctors on a mission to track down someone who might have been exposed to the virus were attacked with stones. Misleading WhatsApp videos claimed that healthy Muslims were being taken away by health care workers and injected with the virus.

Two doctors were left with serious injuries after the incident in early April.

Online disinformation can have direct consequences, and social media platforms such as Facebook said they'll remove coronavirus posts that pose an immediate threat.

But it can also have indirect or delayed effects.

""I hope she pulls through,"" says Brian Lee Hitchens, the patient in Florida who got sucked in by coronavirus conspiracy theories. ""But if I do lose her, she'll be in a better place.""

Brian and his wife didn't have one firm belief about the disease - instead they oscillated between thinking that the virus was a hoax, linked to 5G, or a real but mild ailment.

So they carried on as normal despite official warnings. Brian went to work as a taxi driver in his hometown of Jupiter. He went shopping and picked up his wife's medications. Despite his wife's sleep apnoea and asthma, he didn't bother with social distancing or wearing a mask.

Catching the virus brought Brian back to reality. He turned to social media, this time to warn people off of misinformation and conspiracy theories.

Experts say posts like Brian's may be more useful in combating conspiracies than news articles and fact checks.

""One of the most effective ways of trying to correct the record,"" says Full Fact's Claire Milne, ""is by getting the person who made the original claim to do it themselves.""

'We lose so many lives because of misinformation'

Brian's may be an extreme case, but with the sheer amount of information circulating - the WHO has called it an ""infodemic"" - many other people have been misled by what they read online.

They're not killing themselves by taking fake cures. Instead, they're lowering their chances of survival by not thinking coronavirus is real or serious.

On an unusually cold Friday in May, two men in their forties arrived at an emergency hospital in the New York borough of Queens. They were roommates, working long shifts and sharing a single bed, and both were seriously ill.

Within hours, Dr Rajeev Fernando saw one die in front of his eyes. The other was put on a ventilator.

Dr Fernando asked the men why they hadn't come to hospital sooner. They explained to him that they read somewhere online that the virus wasn't very serious.

""They try alternative therapies,"" Dr Fernando says. ""They think this is just like the flu.""

The men were in at-risk groups - but Dr Fernando believes they would have fared better if they had ignored the misleading advice and sought help sooner.

Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, says he and his colleagues in the UK have seen patients taking tips from posts they see online - including holding their breath in an attempt to ""diagnose"" themselves or thinking that drinking hot drinks will fight off the virus. Some have cited President Trump's statements about disinfectant.

Dr Maru, the doctor at New York's Elmhurst Hospital, calls the numbers who have potentially delayed treatment ""staggering.""

He knows of neighbours who have caught the disease and died because they believed that social distancing is ineffective or that coronavirus is a hoax. And he says that he and his colleagues spend precious time trying to debunk misinformation when they could be treating patients.

But as he spoke on the phone, exhausted and preparing to return to Elmhurst for another shift, Dr Maru was also quick to shift the blame away from the patients themselves.

""Misinformation is a structural problem,"" he says. ""Blaming somebody for ingesting bleach or for staying at home and dying is akin to blaming somebody who is walking down the street and gets hit by a drunk driver.""

In response to the wave of misinformation, social media companies have drawn up new rules. In a statement, Facebook said: ""We don't allow harmful misinformation and have removed hundreds of thousands of posts including false cures, claims that coronavirus doesn't exist, that it's caused by 5G or that social distancing is ineffective."" The company also says it has put warning labels on 90 million pieces of content.

YouTube says it does not allow content promoting dangerous so-called cures and has a range of policies against Covid-19 misinformation, including disputing the existence of the disease or suggesting that it is caused by 5G.

But as research continues into a coronavirus vaccine, many anti-vaccination and conspiracy-minded groups and accounts have seen their numbers swell. They pose a potential health threat - albeit not an immediate risk.

What some doctors we spoke to fear the most is that the development of a coronavirus vaccine - something that would be a human achievement for the ages - could be completely undermined by misinformation.

The future is scary, medical professionals say, because of what they're seeing right now.

""We lose so many lives. They come in very late,"" says Dr Fernando in New York. He's just finished a night shift, and as we talk on Skype, a protective mask dangles from his ears. ""And we just watch them die in front of our eyes.""

Brian, the coronavirus patient in Florida, has a message for the people who still believe in the conspiracy theories he endorsed just a few days ago.

""Don't be foolish like I was,"" he says, ""and the same thing won't happen to you like it happened to me and my wife.""

The model explores the way cognition evolves via cultural inputs. After all, the brain is not limited to an organ housed within the bony skull, but also includes a significant extra-cranial component consisting of the evolving socio-cultural political milieu, wherein various unequally distributed and contested discursive fields gather and entangle themselves. In 1996, he co-founded Artbrain.org which consists of The Journal of Neuroaesthetics and Chaoid Gallery, where works and ideas of artists of all disciplines encounter brain research and the emerging field of so called ""Neuroaesthetics"", synchronously with his lecture series in Neuroaesthetics at the School of Visual Arts, New York City.

 Selected exhibitions include the Venice Biennale, Whitney Museum of American Art, LACMA, The Walker Art Centre and MoMA PS1. Currently, his solo exhibition Rumor to Delusion runs at the Zuecca Project Space in Venice. Starting from the Pizzagate fake news story in the 2016 US presidential campaign, Neidich questions whether and to what degree sensationalised fictive news stories command our attention and collective behaviour. At the exhibition opening, he also launched his new book Glossary of Cognitive Activism, which forms the basis of an upcoming series of performative lectures and talks as well as a multidisciplinary symposium on fake news.

811,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - A North Carolina man who fired an assault rifle multiple times inside a pizza restaurant in the nation’s capital while he claimed he was investigating the internet conspiracy theory known as “pizzagate” will face federal charges.

Edgar Maddison Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina, appeared briefly in Superior Court in the District of Columbia on Tuesday.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Sonali Patel told a judge that prosecutors are dismissing the local charges because they have obtained a federal arrest warrant. Patel didn’t detail the federal charges. It’s not clear when Welch will appear in federal court.

The 28-year-old Welch has been in jail since the Dec. 4 shooting at Comet Ping Pong, which has been falsely rumored to be the site of a child sex trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats.

Welch’s parents were in court, but declined to speak to a reporter.

Police have said Welch acknowledged coming to “self-investigate” the conspiracy theory and surrendered “when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.” No one was hurt.

In an interview with the New York Times, Welch expressed regret.

“I just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way,” Welch said.

Welch, 28, told the newspaper he started driving to Washington from his Salisbury, North Carolina, home intending only to give the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant a “closer look.” But while on the way, he said he felt his “heart breaking over the thought of innocent people suffering.”

Welch would not say why he brought an AR-15 into the pizza shop and fired it, the newspaper reported.

Asked what he thought when he found there were no children in the restaurant, Welch said: “The intel on this wasn’t 100 percent.” But he would not completely dismiss the online claims while talking to the newspaper, conceding only that there were no children “inside that dwelling.”

Welch appears to have lived an aimless life that became turbulent in the weeks before he was drawn to the nation’s capital by a fake news story.

Friends and family say he is a well-meaning father of two girls who wanted to be a firefighter. But he also unnerved some with his religious fervor and sometimes had trouble detaching himself from the internet.",mainstream

An aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.

Imran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.

Awan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.

Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.

Awan worked as an information technology staffer for Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.

""Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,"" Damron said in a emailed statement.

Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.

The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a ""riskier"" forms of collateral, according to court documents.

However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.

The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife. However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.

Awan's wife initiated a $283,000 wire transfer in January 2017 through the credit union to Faisalabad, Pakistan, which included the $165,000 loan, according to court documents.

His wife and their three children left the country in March with $12,700 cash from Dulles International Airport to Lahore, according to court documents.

Officials said they do not believe that his wife plans to return to the U.S.

Awan was released after his arraignment and is under a ""high-intensity supervision program,"" said Bill Miller, a U.S. Attorney’s office spokesman.

Awan received a GPS monitor and has a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also must remain in a 50-mile radius of his Virginia residence. Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.

Awan’s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and ""began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.""

""For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media but from sitting members of Congress,"" Gowen said in an emailed statement.

To make his point, he pauses one of the video tweets of the snakes and points out a ""black horned face"" on the CGI scales.

He points out what appears to be eyes, mouth and horns, and says: “Here, folks, is a demon. No denying it, so that was a cryptic message in this little... this little video thing.”

The Youtuber, who has previously linked Taylor to the Illuminati, references other signs in her promotional material which ""support"" his claim.

For example, he claims her jumper with “Illuminati-type pyramids” (triangles), her “evil eye of Horus” (her eye) and her necklace that supposedly indicates “she is a slave to the Satanic system” all back up his theory.

""She’s been murdered and been replaced by a clone""

Fans of the popstar will have noticed she remained absent from social media and public appearances in the run-up to her comeback.

Some claim that this is proof that Taylor is the latest of many dead stars who have been replaced by identical duplicates.

Reddit conspiracy fan A_D_D_I_C_T wrote: “Is she already dead and replaced? Failure to comply, she wanted to keep her self, so they killed her and replaced her.

“This has been done before with Miley Cyrus as the notable example.

“She was told to flip her image and become a whore but didn't want to so they killed her and replaced her.”

Fans have pointed out that the line in her new song doesn’t help to dispel the myth: “I'm sorry but the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Oh, 'cause she's DEAD.""

She is the latest in a long line of stars, including Beyonce, Avril Lavigne and Miley, who have all been accused of being the same.



One of the most bizarre theories circling the web is that Taylor is exposing the truth about the fictitious online conspiracy theory dubbed ""Pizzagate"".

The conspiracy theory originated on 4chan and was based on emails hacked from the Democratic Party and published by Wikileaks.

It stated the party ran a child sex ring at Comet Ping Pong in Washington and users of 4chan and Reddit claimed that words in the emails - such as cheese and pizza - were code for young children and sex acts.

The story is entirely false and the FBI has not confirmed anything about Pizzagate or related conspiracy theories because they’re all wrong.

Some forums claim that the spiralling snake from the music video represents paedophilia, meanwhile another user said the snakes shattering into triangles is “Pizzagate unravelling and spiralling out of the globalist's control.”

And some say the newspaper print means Taylor is calling out the mainstream media for “covering up” Pizzagate.

According to a thread on 4chan's right-wing politics board, Taylor's line ""I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me, I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams"" translates to ""The Jews call us Nazis no matter what we do simply because we're white. Now, we will give them Nazis.""

And another claimed the lyrics ""I don't like your games, Don't like your tilted stage"" are about how ""Taylor, being a white, blonde haired, blue eyed woman is made to be an object of hatred and degredation by the Jews.""



Serpent imagery has been surrounding Taylor for the past year following the singer's feud with the Kardashian-Wests last year over Kanye West's song Famous.

Kim uploaded some images to Snapchat on National Snake Day exposing recordings of phone calls between Taylor and Kayne, which suggest she knew about the song all along.

People then reacted calling her a snake and using the snake emoji to represent this.

Reddit's Conspiracy chat board user ParamoreFanClub said: “For weeks I've been saying Taylor swift gave birth to a reptilian baby the. She tweets this?

“This isn't a coincidence... We haven't seen an actual picture of her for months now(due to the pregnancy). Reptiles are going mainstream, the end is near.”

When asked for more clarification, they responded: “kim kardashian is a well known lizard, and the snakes and lizards have been going at it for years. trump is a snake and the clintons are lizards(they were friends until recently).""

These aren't the only outlandish theories that have been said about a popstar.

Some speculate Beyonce is part of the Illuminati, and others have said that died in 2000 and was replaced by a reptilian, and others claim she is a clone.",mainstream

As investigators search for the man who they say set a small fire last week at D.C.-area pizza shop, Comet Ping Pong, followers of the debunked “pizzagate” conspiracy theory have been speculating about what was “really” behind the blaze.

“To destroy evidence or vengeance? I hope the latter,” a user wrote on the public Facebook group “PizzagateUncompromised,” one of hundreds of comments in dozens of Facebook groups dedicated to the conspiracy theory.

In one group, users responded to news that Comet pizza was on fire with gifs of people eating popcorn. Others just celebrated.

“Burn baby burn that evil place of debauchery of children, torture and murder down,” one user wrote.

Pizzagate — which alleged that Hillary Clinton and prominent Democrats ran a child sex and sacrifice ring out of the pizzeria’s basement — has mostly waned since its nadir in December 2016, when a North Carolina man on a mission to rescue imaginary children fired several shots from an assault-style rifle inside the restaurant. Eclipsed by a related conspiracy theory, Qanon, pizzagate has decreased in popularity in part due to crackdowns by online platforms. Reddit banned the pizzagate groups in 2016 and YouTube recently announced a commitment to stop recommending conspiracy videos.

But they still have a home on Facebook.

In over 30 different open and closed Facebook groups, boasting more than 40,000 collective members, pizzagate followers have kept the conspiracy alive. In the face of reason, these pizzagate adherents have held tightly to “evidence” — mostly what they allege is coded language and symbols that link shapes to pedophelia and food products like cheese and pasta to children.

The members post misinformation and wild allegations linking just about anyone to a world-wide pedopehila ring. Their targets have included everyone and everything from local businesses to Tom Hanks to a random Facebook user wearing a t-shirt with the image of a slice of pizza on it. This week, a major topic of conversation has been Celine Dion’s weight loss, which group members falsely attributed to an addiction to Adrenochrome, a real chemical compound that pizzagate conspiracists claim is “harvested” from tortured children, and taken by the political and Hollywood elite to get high.

None of this is borne out by any evidence to be true in any way.

In 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the platform was refocusing the Newsfeed so that users would see less content from media and brands and more from their friends, family and groups. For the majority of Facebook users, that meant more posts from local parent collectives, spread out family groups, or like-minded hobbyists.

For the more conspiratorial user, it can amount to a curated cult.

It’s not merely the existence of pizzagate-like conspiracy groups, but the mechanisms by which Facebook serves them up, that can radicalize users, said Renée DiResta, a researcher of disinformation online and director of research at New Knowledge.

Joining a Facebook group tells Facebook to suggest other groups and pages related to the topic.

“If you like something, it will show you more of that,” DiResta said. “So belonging to gardening groups will make Facebook suggest to you more gardening groups.”

Facebook’s suggestion algorithm also infers commonalities between users and other members of groups that user joins.

“In a healthy way, this may mean Facebook is saying ‘If you like gardening, maybe you also like cooking,’” DiResta said. “In the case of conspiracy content, Facebook’s recommendation engine says, ‘If you like pseudoscience, I’ll show you chemtrails and flat earth.’”

“Because of the increase of ominous conspiracies, you’re seeing groups around these conspiracy theories like QAnon or pizzagate being referred to people who would never search for them in the first place.”

As an example, for users who find their way into a pizzagate interest group named after Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta — whose stolen emails are misread in a way to inform much of the Pizzagate conspiracy — a right rail labeled “Suggested Groups” includes the group “Pizzagate Reports,” the header image for which is prominent Democrats including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and George Soros, photoshopped with glowing red eyes in what appears to be a Satanic ritual.

Similarly, users visiting the private group “Pizzagate,” topped with an image that points to Comet’s owner James Alefantis as the ringleader of a child sacrifice ring — are pushed to join other fringe groups including, “Real UFO Sightings & Strange Phenomenon,” “Official Flat Earth & Globe Discussion,” and “Q Angels,” a group dedicated to an unfounded conspiracy theory involving Donald Trump and a secret war against a cabal of alleged child abusers.

“We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of misinformation through our False News policy,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News. ""We know there’s still work to be done and we recognize that helping people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse is a challenging and sensitive issue. For these reasons, we don't remove false news from Facebook but instead, significantly reduce its distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed.”

In a July interview with Recode editor Kara Swisher, CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the practice of letting conspiracy groups remain, but acknowledged Facebook’s responsibility to take down misinformation that could induce violence.

Alefantis told The Washington Post that the shop still regularly gets harassing phone calls, a practice discussed in several of the pizzagate Facebook Groups.

“At first [the manager] said I was making him physically shake and now he just listens to me until he finally hangs up. He never really answers or addresses my concerns. But I still call. Once a day, every day,” one woman wrote last year under a post about her efforts to call Comet regularly.

581,"ISISGATE … And It Doesn’t Get Any Bigger Than That

For those many citizen journalists who are in the know, Pizzagate was immediately recognized as the scandal that will literally take down the U.S. Federal Government, after it dissolves the Democratic Party.

This epic and rapidly unfolding crime spree has all the elements to incriminate many leading politicians and D.C. power-brokers, well-known globalists and Beltway lobbyists. Truly, this is the scandal that the American people have been waiting for.

Of all the scandals that end in “Gate”, it is the Pedophilia Pizzagate that has the potential to do the most damage to the existing criminal power structure that was shoehorned into power in Washington D.C. by the World Shadow Government (WSG).

The political power structure that has been recently dominated by the Podestas and Pelosis, the Obamas and Clintons, the Reids and Ryans has been fastidiously kept in check via an extremely effective strategy that irreversibly compromises and corrupts the political class. Of course, this is done by setting up the politician with lurid sex crimes, especially those with child sexual abuse and trafficking.

Even many good politicians are lured into attending an event that is presented in one fashion, only for them to be treated to a Satanic child sex ritual late in the night when they should have been home in bed. Their very attendance at such a scandalous crime scene allows them to be blackmail and/or bribed over the rest of his or her political career. Do you see how Congress is forever kept in perfect check by their globalist overlords, Zionist plotters and Jesuit masters? And why Congress never really investigates itself or prosecutes the President, except to root out the really good guys and gals.

That’s all about to change

The recent exposure of Pizzagate has changed the whole Washington control dynamic. With each odious revelation this secret sub-culture within the Beltway has been exposed in ways that are both shocking and earth-shattering. Citizen reporters who are researching this story are zealous and resolute in their journalistic pursuit of the truth. Many of them have children and will not let this multi-decade crime spree go unreported, in all of it grisly detail.

For those who are uninitiated in this realm of pedophilia in the corridors of power, the following links will provide a quick primer for what is about to explode in the mainstream media (MSM). Yes, the WSG has been extremely successful in keeping these sordid details out of the MSM, as they did with the Franklin scandal many years ago, but there wasn’t an Internet back then.

First and foremost, the serious investigator is highly advised to watch the following video:

Then there are these recent important exposés:

The Podesta Pedophilia Scandal Just Keeps Growing

What the reader has been exposed to by way of the preceding exposés is citizen journalism at its very best. Each of these Alt-Media warriors has had the courage to view the underbelly of American political life. In so doing they are freeing the many sexually abused children who have been held victim over their respective lifetimes by their serial abusers and captors.

The following article by the Anonymous Patriots expresses a dire need at this critical time of American (and world) history. Every reader is highly encouraged to take to heart the plea that is made. For it is We the People that now possess the power to break the back of the repugnant conspiracy that has controlled the U.S. Federal Government for so many decades.

If you really want to take your power back from these criminally insane psychopaths, this is perhaps the best way to begin.

PIZZAGATE UNFOLDS: MSM Reporters Will Not Do Their Jobs so Citizen Reporters Must Expose the Crime of the Century

Engaged citizen journalism around the world is going full force and the globalists and elites are getting nervous. We are uncovering hard circumstantial evidence that needs to be followed up by law enforcement authorities who have not, themselves, been corrupted by the pedophile blackmail that has engulfed our world. People, especially those who have been involved with the child pornography-sex scandal-satanic rituals blackmail and pizza parties need to start coming forward as humanity cannot make spiritual progress as long as these satanic forces lurk behind compromised politicians, government officials, church and community leaders, and, most especially, the elite who continue to rule and enslave We The People from their lofty thrones of power and money.

Citizen journalists (CJs) have uncovered a tremendous amount of information since the story of Comet Ping Pong was released this week. The question is whether there is anyone left in LAW ENFORCEMENT that has not been blackmailed, co-opted, or life-threatened to make a simple inquiry into the U. S. Passport Office that will begin to solve this crime.

CHECK THE PASSPORTS OF ANTHONY WEINER AND JOHN AND TONY PODESTA TO SEE IF THEY WERE IN PORTUGAL IN MAY 2007, AT THE TIME OF MADELINE’S ABDUCTION.

We now have circumstantial evidence of the striking resemblance between the photographs and the police sketches for the Podestas and Anthony Weiner.

We also see that there appears to be emails deleted from Podesta’s email account during the time of Madeline’s disappearance on May 3, 2007. Did he wipe his emails to destroy evidence of his links to Portugal and the McCann’s?

We also know that John Podesta travelled to Portugal in 2014, which alone does not show his visit to Portugal in May 2007, but it would warrant any ROOKIE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT to check the passports of both Podestas and Weiner in May 2007.

Where is LAW ENFORCEMENT in the United States, England, and Portugal? Must citizens do the job of both reporters and investigators?

We want to know about the Comet Ping Pong Pizza Restaurant in Washington D.C. We want to know if the Podestas and Weiner were in Portugal in May 2007.

We want to know about the underground tunnels that connect the Comet Ping Pong to other stores in the Washington area.

We want to know why Nancy Pelosi is associated with a pizza a restaurant called the GOAT HILL (goat is a reference to the devil, folks) in San Francisco.

We want to know what in the hell is happening in this country that demons have law enforcement, politicians, and officials so compliant to their evil that children are being sacrificed upon their altars in the worship of Satan. Is there anyone in the FBI and NYPD that has the morality and decency to bring these matters to light? If so, just know that We The People have your back!",conspiracy
376,"UPDATE: Linda Ives Asks QAnon And President Trump For Help To Find The Killer Of Her Son – Plus Interview With Billy Jack Haynes.

Please refer to the article: http://investmentwatchblog.com/update-to-billy-jack-haynes-linda-ives-fight-for-justice-arkansas-clinton-the-train-deaths/

I have an amazing update to this story. Linda Ives is a remarkable human being, who covers every base possible to find the truth in her son’s murder. As she says, “his name was Kevin Ives.” She does connect this to the murder of Seth Rich, in the fact we do not yet know who murdered Seth. Linda reminds us all, we do not realize that there is murder in politics. Another aspect that Kevin and Seth have in common, they are both in a better place than we are. However, no one should have his or her life stolen from them in such a brutal manner.

Linda Ives has reached out to President Trump and QAnon for help. I will be covering this outreach in this report.

First of all you can read all the documents in the Linda Ives lawsuit: Ives Civil Complaint

Here is a video on a development which is recorded on the date of November 27, 2017.

A federal judge has ordered a private review of tightly guarded documents related to an unsolved murder of two boys covered up by local authorities 30 years ago, then governor Bill Clinton was accused of being involved with the death after he reportedly made a deal with the medical examiner accused of destroying key evidence related to the case. It is believed that teenagers Kevin Ives and Don Henry witnessed a drug operation allegedly tied to Clinton and the CIA. The mother of one of the victims recently asked the public for help in reigniting the investigation into this murder.

Here is a video which is most important in understanding how Haynes met Clinton and how he came to be a witness to the murders of Kevin Ives and Don Henry.

Talks in Detail of the Murders of Don Henry & Kevin Ives in Alexander, Arkansas on August 23rd, 1987 & their bodies were then placed on railroad tracks to be run over by a train. The murders of the two boys were until now unsolved.

I am going to do a synopsis of this interview, as it is so important. I want to stress the following is in my own words and not quoted from the video.

Doc says KTV had video footage of Haynes wrestling in Detroit two days before the boys were murdered. How did he get to be there in Arkansas at that time?

Haynes begins by saying he was born and raised for crime, as he had been abused as a young child. He had kept his life secret until now.

While wrestling in Detroit, he had received an envelope to “call home.” However, it had an Arkansas number.

Haynes said when he called the number, Clinton put him through a period of questioning. Eventually he trusted it was Haynes, and asked him if he would like to do business with him the way it had been done in Florida. Haynes told him he would.

Haynes does stumble around quite a bit in the interview, but Doc makes it clear he wants to know exactly how he went from Detroit to Arkansas to witness the murders of Kevin Ives and Don Henry.

Doc asks how he met Clinton. Haynes goes on to say, in 1982, he met Barry Seal, who was an American pilot who became involved in running drugs for the CIA. When Seal trusted him, he started transporting Seal’s cargo.

In time, Seal wanted him to meet an Arkansas politician. It turned out to be Bill Clinton, and at that time he was the Governor of Arkansas.

In 1987, he received the note while he was in Detroit. Previously, he had met everyone at the Rose Law Firm. He stated he had wanted to go “big time.”

After he called Clinton in 1987, Clinton briefed him on a situation that was upsetting to him. Clinton sent him a ticket from Detroit to Little Rock on August 22, 1987. He said Sheriff Jim Steed would pick him up at the airport and take him to the Governor’s mansion.

There he met both Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and shook hands with them. He stated Sheriff Steed stayed outside.

Clinton said someone was stealing from the drug drops in Alexander, and the Clintons wanted Haynes there to provide muscle. They told him he should bring his wrestling mask with him.

The Clintons believed two Arkansas state police officers had stolen a million in cash from the drops. The Clintons asked him to put a tape inside his suit and a VHS camera to film the drop to see who was stealing.

Clinton said other guys with the crew would show up, too. Haynes asked who they were, and Clinton said Haynes had met them at the Rose Law Firm.

Clinton said that if they caught the guys who were stealing, “we would cuff them up, and put them in the van”

Then shockingly Haynes says, “Clinton told me it would be my job to beat them to death.”

Doc asks him why after 30 years later he was coming forward. Haynes said he wanted to open a gymn and come clean. He said he was drugged out during that time, and he had even tried to commit suicide.

In 2012, he said that Tyrone Woods, who died in Benghazi, had worked out at his gymn. He said he then made up his mind to do the right thing and reached out to Linda Ives.

Then Haynes said all that is left is to tell you what went down. Haynes said that his entire life had been an explosion of violence.

Going on to say that night he and Sheriff Steed sat up in the woods back from the drop. A van came in to where the drop was. There was flashlight communication. A third car came in from the right with two police officers. Next a car came in with Dan Harmon, who was high on cocaine.

Haynes took the VHS tape out. Midnight came and the plane came in between 12 and 1am. Haynes taped it, and nothing happened. No one stole anything. Haynes felt it was an inside job.

He went on to say he had accepted the Lord, and he needed to come forward to tell Linda Ives what happened to these kids. He said he was not going to take this to his grave, and he did not care if he was killed, too.

Then he went on to after the drop, after the pickup, Kirk Lane and Jay Campbell got out of their car.

He said they talked for a while. Then Dan Harmon got out of the car and asked who Haynes was. The Sheriff said that he was with Bill Clinton, and that is all you need to know.

Then Dan Harmon tried to call Bill Clinton, but he could not get through due to the trees. Then they all proceeded up to the train tracks. Harmon then said, “hey, hey, hey!”

There were guys on the tracks. There was a third one on a motorcycle, and Haynes heard a gunshot. Then they took off. Harmon called down to Sheriff Stead to get the “f…..”

Then Jay Campbell and Kirk Lane took out after the boys. They were gone for 20 minutes, and they brought the boys back over their shoulders in handcuffs and bleeding profusely. They had been beaten with the flashlights.

It was obvious to Haynes one boy was already dead, and it was Don Henry. They threw both down like a sack of potatoes on the train tracks. He said Kevin Ives was vomiting blood.

At that point, the phone was held up to Haynes, and he talked to the Governor. Haynes told the Governor no Arkansas officers had stolen from the drop, but now there were these two kids…it looks like they are dead.

The voice on the phone told Haynes there could be no witnesses. The others repeated, “there could be no witnesses.” At that time they took the butt of the rifle which belonged to Kevin Ives, with full force, and smashed Kevin Ives in the back of his head.

This is where the video ended.

The following is some background on some of those mentioned by Haynes in the video.

CBN News 7/29/98 Gary Lane “… But what caused Dr. Malak to arrive at such an outrageous determination of death? Then-Governor Bill Clinton said his state medical examiner was overworked and “stressed out.” Former Clinton employee and well-known Clinton critic Larry Nichols says Mr. Clinton was an accomplice in concealing the truth.But why would Mr. Clinton defend Malak, although his rulings had been questioned in more than 20 cases? Dateline NBC and The Los Angeles Times have suggested a motive. They’ve documented Fahmy Malak’s role in clearing Bill Clinton’s mother, the late Virginia Kelley, of wrongdoing in the negligent death of a teenage girl at Ouachita Memorial Hospital in 1981. The Los Angeles Times reported that Dr. Malak’s ruling helped Clinton’s mother avoid scrutiny in the death of patient Susie Deer. The Times quoted the Polaski County coroner as saying there was a lot of speculation that “Malak’s ruling in favor of Clinton’s mother was a factor” in the governor’s decision to retain him as state medical examiner. Then-Governor Clinton said he resented any implications of a connection, and the governor’s office proceeded to shut down further investigation of the train deaths. Dr. Malak was eventually removed as state medical examiner, but was given a job as a $70,000 per year consultant to the Arkansas Department of Health. Regardless, a grand jury determined that Kevin Ives and Don Henry had been murdered. But why? Who would want to kill two teens who were just out “deer spotting” on that fateful August night? . “

Email 6/1/99 Jean Duffy [Ives and Henry] “… Linda Ives did not know, at the time, that my task force’s investigation included the murders of Kevin and Don, and I did not know that by the time I left the state, Linda knew Harmon was part of the cover-up of the murders. It was not until 1994 that we met, shared information, and realized that the corruption and cover-up expanded beyond the county and state levels. We had each been contacted by the FBI after an eye witness came forward and passed a polygraph test placing Dan Harmon on the tracks(7) with Kevin and Don the night they were murdered. Linda and I were more encouraged than ever before. We had complete confidence in the FBI. By late 1994, we learned that Kevin and Don were murdered by law enforcement officials because they stumbled upon a drug drop from an airplane…..

ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT-GAZETTE 8/5/99 Linda Satter “…The mother of one of two boys found dead on Saline County railroad tracks nearly 10 years ago, in a case that spawned two grand jury investigations but no arrests, testified Wednesday in defense of a filmmaker who made a widely distributed video about the case.Linda Ives, whose son, Kevin Ives, 17, was killed along with his friend Don Henry, 16, testified for three hours on behalf of Patrick Matrisciana of Hemet, Calif., who produced the 60-minute program Obstruction of Justice: the Mena Connection. It has sold about 300,000 copies. Two Pulaski County sheriff’s lieutenants, Jay Campbell and Kirk Lane, sued Matrisciana in 1997. They contended that he defamed them by mentioning their names at the end of the film, along with four other men, as “suspects implicated in Ives/Henry murders and coverups.” Campbell and Lane, who as deputies in another jurisdiction didn’t participate in the investigation of the train deaths, blame former Saline County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Harmon for drawing them into the case. Harmon, now in prison on drug and racketeering convictions arising partly from corrupt acts he performed while in his official capacity, was a private lawyer at the time of the boys’ deaths. But he took a special interest in the case and was appointed a special prosecutor to present the case to a Saline County grand jury. Testimony this week has revealed that, unknown to the public, Harmon was the target at the time of at least one investigation into drug trafficking. Campbell and Lane, then narcotics deputies who were looking into the allegations about Harmon, contend that he heard about their investigation and cast them as suspects in the train deaths solely to taint their credibility and thwart their investigation….”

ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT-GAZETTE 8/5/99 Linda Satter “…Ives acknowledged Wednesday that Harmon called her the day before Campbell and Lane were to appear before a grand jury and told her that “the killers” would appear before the grand jury the next day. Ives said she trusted Harmon at the time, but she has since come to include him among the list of suspects in the boys’ deaths and ensuing coverup….The video was released in 1996 before Harmon’s convictions. They [plaintiffs] say the allegations have damaged their personal and professional reputations. But Matrisciana, using the First Amendment as a defense, contends that the two sources he relied on to make the film — Linda Ives and a former Saline County deputy prosecutor, Jean Duffey — both believed the video was accurate when they made it. Thus, Matrisciana contends, he cannot be found to have had a “reckless disregard for the truth” and thus be guilty of libel. …..”

ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT-GAZETTE 8/5/99 Linda Satter “…Among the information that has emerged is that John Brown, who reopened the investigation as an investigator under a new Saline County sheriff, Judy Pridgen, took a handwritten “confession” in May 1993 from Sharline Wilson, who once dated Harmon. Though she would later recant her statement, Wilson named Harmon and two other men, one of whom was later killed, as having had a role in beating and stabbing the boys to death before laying their bodies across the tracks. Brown testified Tuesday that he corroborated “85 percent” of what Wilson told him…..”

8/6/99 Alan Fram Linda Satter Arkansas Democrat-Gazette “…At the center of allegations that two undercover officers participated in the 1987 killings of two Saline County boys is a Little Rock man who left the federal courts building in Little Rock this week with a “scared look” in his eyes and hasn’t been seen since, a defense attorney said Thursday. John Wesley Hall Jr., who is representing Patrick Matrisciana of Hemet, Calif., in a federal defamation lawsuit, made those assertions Thursday in seeking permission to introduce normally unallowable “hearsay evidence” of what the missing witness, Ronnie Godwin, once said. U.S. District Judge Warren K. Urbom of Lincoln, Neb., who is presiding over the trial as a visiting judge, told Hall he would rule on the question as the defense case nears an end, if Godwin still hasn’t been found by a private detective that Hall hired Tuesday. Godwin had been subpoenaed as a plaintiff’s witness but left the courthouse this week after being excused without testifying. Hall said that Godwin claimed to have been “followed” from the building…..”

8/6/99 Alan Fram Linda Satter Arkansas Democrat-Gazette “…Linda Ives, the mother of one of the slain boys, Kevin Ives, 17, testified earlier Thursday that Godwin claimed in 1987 to have seen two men grab Ives and his friend, Don Henry, 16, outside the Ranchette grocery store in Alexander and beat them, then forced them into a police car on the night they were killed. Godwin’s description of the two assailants matched those of Jay Campbell and Kirk Lane, then undercover narcotics officers for the Pulaski County sheriff’s office. However, a police report states that Godwin admitted he’d been drinking before stopping at the store where the two boys allegedly ran to a pay telephone to seek help and were grabbed. Police also quoted Godwin’s mother as saying he can’t be believed when he’s been drinking….”

8/6/99 Alan Fram Linda Satter Arkansas Democrat-Gazette “…Ives testified that she believes Campbell and Lane killed her son and Henry, based on Godwin’s remarks, corroboration from another man named “Gerry” and remarks of John Brown of Mabelvale, a former Saline County detective who looked into the boys’ deaths years later under a new sheriff, Judy Pridgen. Campbell and Lane, now sheriff’s office lieutenants, are suing Matrisciana for defaming them at the end of a 60-minute videotape, Obstruction of Justice: the Mena Connection, that Matrisciana produced in 1996…. Brown, while acknowledging that he had heard the “Campbell and Lane scenario,” as the allegations are known, testified this week that he didn’t personally investigate the claims or develop Campbell or Lane as suspects. He said the women knew that, and that he warned Matrisciana that “any such statement was uncorroborated and I did not think there was anything to it.” Brown said he told the filmmaker that he “should not implicate Jay Campbell or Kirk Lane. … If he makes such statements, he could be sued.”…”

8/6/99 Alan Fram Linda Satter Arkansas Democrat-Gazette “… Campbell and Lane say Harmon tried to paint them as suspects because, unbeknownst to the public at the time, they were investigating drug-trafficking allegations against him, and he had found that out and wanted to discredit them. Harmon is now in prison on drug and racketeering charges. Brown’s testimony supported that assertion. He said Harmon “sidetracked me to them, and to other people, saying, ‘Have you checked them out?’ ” Hall asked, “Did he do anything to interfere with your investigation?” Brown replied, “Anything and everything that he could, yes sir.”…”

Arkansas Democrat-Gazette 8/10/99 Linda Satter “…A federal jury awarded more than half a million dollars Monday to two Pulaski County sheriff’s lieutenants after finding that a California filmmaker defamed them in a film about the deaths of two Saline County boys in 1987. After three hours of deliberation Friday, followed by seven hours Monday, the seven-woman, five-man panel returned a unanimous verdict against Patrick Matrisciana of Hemet, Calif. They found that in his 1996 documentary, Obstruction of Justice: the Mena Connection, Matrisciana libeled veteran sheriff’s deputies Jay Campbell, 38, and Kirk Lane, 37, in accusing them and four other law enforcement officials of murdering the boys and covering it up. The other officials, also named at the end of the film, have not sued…..”

www.kark.com 8/12/99 Kim Miller “…During the last week, Sharline Wilson was referred to by investigators as an eyewitness to a 1987 Saline County murder that remains unsolved. Now, Sharline Wilson has told News4 what she knows about the mysterious deaths of Kevin Ives and Don Henry. Wilson says she cannot directly connect anyone with the murders of the boys–whose bodies were found on railroad tracks. But she says she dropped then-prosecutor Dan Harmon off near the tracks that night, and waited while he went to pick up a drug drop. She says that when Harmon returned, he had blood on his pants–as if he had wiped his hands on them. Wilson says that her later testimony about Harmon’s involvement with drugs got her into trouble. “In 1992, I was arrested by Dan Harmon and the 7th Judicial District Drug Task Force on some little old drug charges that should have never ever brought me 32 years in prison,” she said. Wilson claims no one believes her because she was high at the time of the incident and because she has a history of drug use. Wilson says anything else she knows about the case is hearsay. As for Dan Harmon, he chose not to comment on the murders. He is serving time in an Illinois prison on drug charges….”

I want to say I believe Haynes, and this is the most shocking conversation I have ever heard. I cannot imagine what Linda Ives must have felt to discover how her son died.

I had mentioned earlier that Linda Ives had reached out to President Trump and QAnon for help. The following link is where I discovered this.

In the early morning hours of August 23, 1987, a 75-car long Union Pacific train was approaching the small city of Bryant, Arkansas during a regular nightly run from Texarkana to Little Rock. Just after 4:00 AM, the crew noticed a “dark spot” on the track just beyond a railroad trestle. When the engineer had finally determined what the mysterious shape on the tracks was and had thrown on the locomotive’s emergency brakes—leaning all the while on the horn—it was too late. The bodies of local teenagers Kevin Ives, 17, and Don Henry, 16, had been run over and mangled by the passing train, whose crew was helpless to stop it. The crew reported that the boys were lying across the tracks in a “completely relaxed state”, arms at their sides, upon impact, and that they had not moved a “flinch”, even when the three locomotives of the mile-long train were seconds away from them.

The state medical examiner initially ruled that the boys had smoked over 20 marijuana cigarettes, laid across the tracks, and had fallen into a deep sleep resulting from the “psychadelic effects of THC.” Only after the boys’ bodies were exhumed and autopsied by an independent, out-of-state examiner was it discovered that Henry and Ives had actually been dead and unconscious, respectively, before they had even been run over by the train. What would unravel over the next 20 years would be a series of lies, coverups, obstructions and miscarriages of justice—and even death—that would haunt the grieving Ives and Henry families for decades.

Whatever happened that dark Sunday morning, Kevin and Don clearly walked upon something they were not supposed to have seen. And local, state, and federal authorities seem to know just what that “something” is.

Twenty years have passed without the Ives and Henry families gaining the answers and closure they need. Let’s be an informed, active public who will see that those 20 years don’t become 30.

I, also, found this from Reddit:

“Do you like conspiracies? This rabbit hole runs deep:

The murdered boys apparently witnessed illegal activities by members of a group involved in a massive conspiracy involving some of the most powerful organizations and ruthless people in the world – including the CIA, Mossad, Mafia, and elements within the governments of the US, Israel, Panama, El Salvador, Iran and others.

A few of the Key players in this vast conspiracy allegedly included: VP George W. Bush; AR Gov. Bill (and Hillary?) Clinton; Panama dictator Colonel Manuel Noriega and his close associate Michael Harari, an agent for the Israeli Mossad.

At the time, Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport was a central hub for clandestine operations, used to circumvent Customs and Border Patrol scrutiny.

Cargo being Flown into the Mena airport from Panama were Drugs and “Contra Rebel” soldiers from El Salvador who were brought in for training in secret US facilities. The drugs would move into the US black market, and soldiers who had finished training were shipped back to Panama, along with cash and weaponry.

On Jun 21, 1991, Richard J. Brenneke gave a sworn oral deposition before US Congressman William Alexander Jr and Chad Farris, Chief Deputy Attorney General for the state of Arkansas. Brenneke answered questions regarding the role the role he played related to CIA operations at Mena airport.

Below are a few snippets from that deposition:

Joint Investigation by Arkansas State Attorney General’s Office and The United States Congress
• So you were an independent contractor with the Central Intelligence Agency?
• Beginning when and through what years?
• 1968 through about 1986, somewhere in 1985, ‘86 is when I called it off.
• So what services did you perform for the Central Intelligence Agency?
• Specialized in two activities; I handled money for them, I handled East Bloc weapons purchases primarily made in Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.
• Did you ever pilot an aircraft to a location at Mena, Arkansas?
• Yes, sir. I did on a number of occasions.
• And what aircraft did you fly into Mena?
• I generally flew a C 130. Aircraft would be brought into Mena, the first trips that I made started in early ’84.
• I see. Were you based out of Mena for a period of time?
• That would be a very appropriate description.
• How many flights would you say that you made from the Mena, Arkansas airport for the CIA during the period of time that you worked for them?
• Ten to twelve flights. And you flew a C 130?
• Generally flew a C 130. I did, however, on occasion come in — on one occasion specifically I recall coming in on a Lear Jet, on one occasion on a 400 Series Cessna.
• Allright. Now, Mr. Brenneke, could you tell us when you first made a flight for the CIA from Mena, Arkansas?
• It would have been March, April of 1984.
• 1984. And what was the cargo that you transported for the CIA from Mena?
• Okay. From Mena I would take people who had been trained in the area around Mena, generally paramilitary or military forces from Central America. They would be taken back to Panama City, where I would drop them. And, in addition to that, we would carry weapons that were being shipped down there. The weapons, as I’ve said, frequently came either from government stores or through Tamiami Gun Shop in Miami, Florida.
• Now, can you identify for the record some of the kinds of guns that were being shipped from Mena to Central America?
• M l’s, M l rifles, recoil — small recoilless rifles, 106, I’ve forgotten the exact caliber on it, grenades, ammunition for these weapons, fuses, detonator fuses. And I remember that one very specifically because it only happened once. But we had detonator fuses on board, and my concern was that we might have the equipment being detonated on the same flight, and I didn’t want that.
• I see. So as I understand it, they would load the guns and munitions on the C 130, and you and a co pilot, one of whom you’ve identified as Harry Rupp —
• — would fly these munitions and equipment to locations in Central America. Where was the cargo destined for? Where did you fly it to?
• We flew it to Panama City and offloaded it there.
• Do you remember where in Panama City?
• Now, could — were the shipments met by people in Panama?
• Yes, they were. They were met by military types who wore military uniforms and were easily identified as members of the Panamanian Defense Force, which essentially is the Palace Guard.
• Allright. Do you know any of the people? Did you recognize any of the PDF forces that met these shipments’
• I recognized them — I did not know the names of all of them; however, I did know the name of the man who trained them, and he would frequently be there to meet the shipments, and he is a man by the name of Michael Harari.
• Mike Harari was a Mossad agent. He’s an Israeli national. My best understanding is he lives in Israel right now. He was Manuel Noriega’s partner in a number of business deals in Panama. I know that firsthand because I had to deal with him.
• Now, you would stay a night or a couple of days and you returned. And would you return with a cargo?
• Yes, sir, we would. We would come back with individuals, and from time to time unmarked boxes of items that were put in the aircraft along with the individuals. Now, being conservative by nature and not having a death wish, I opened the boxes on a number of occasions to find out what I was flying. And what —
• What did you discover the cargo to be?
• I found the cargo to be cocaine, in some cases marijuana.
• Now, would you describe what you saw when you opened the boxes?
• What I saw when I opened the boxes were plastic bags filled with a white powdery substance. On one occasion I wanted to know more about what it was, so I cut one of them open and tasted it, and I have tasted cocaine in a controlled environment before at the request of law enforcement officials, so this —
• So you positively identified the substances that you were carrying as cocaine?
• How much cocaine would you judge that you were carrying?
• In the course of time there?
• Well, in each load?
• In each load, 4 to 600 pounds.
• Now, what would you do with the load of cocaine once it was loaded onto your C-130; where would you go with it?
• We would bring it to Mena, Arkansas.
• And when you landed at Mena, what would be the disposition of the cargo.
• On one or two occasions the cargo was taken off by people who were not residents of the Mena area and put into other aircraft which departed from there. However, the most frequent activity was that the aircraft would be unloaded in front of Rich Mountain Aviation’s hangers and it would be stored in the back of the hanger.
• And go back in your mind to the first trip you took and describe to me the disposition of the cargo; that is, the cocaine, once it returned to Arkansas, once it was delivered to Arkansas? And I am especially I am particularly interested in the identification of persons other than Freddie Hampton. You’ve talked about Freddie Hampton. You’ve identified him. Can you identify other people who might have received this cocaine?
• Yes. I can identify people who in fact received the cocaine, not “might have.” And —
• Can you tell us who they were?
• I can tell you that they were members of John Gotti’s [crime] family in New York. One of them was an individual known to me by the name of Sal Reale.
• And how did you know Mr. Reale?
• Mr. Reale at that time was the Director of — I believe it was that time, was the Director of Security for Kennedy International Airport in New York City.
• In New York City. Speak to the subject of your knowledge of Mr. Reale and his activities as the head of security at Kennedy? Tell us what you know about him and what he did?
• Okay. Mr. Reale was a — was one of Mr. Gotti’s lieutenants. I watched the two of them interact. Mr. Gotti would provide directions, Mr. Reale would carry them out. It was his job to make sure that cargo being shipped through Kennedy was not lost, but properly located, and in some cases avoiding customs — avoided the customs procedures.
• Are you saying that you saw Mr. John Gotti, the famous bead of the organized crime syndicate, in New York together with Mr. Reale?
• So you worked for Mr. Gotti as well as for the CIA?
• Actually the CIA told me to do that on his behalf.
• So the CIA was in, would you say, partnership or association with Mr. Gotti?
• Yes, sir. I would say a partnership.
• And can you describe the nature of that partnership?
• Sure. The organized crime members had a need for two things; they needed drugs brought into the country on a reliable, safe basis, they needed people taken out of the country or people brought into the country without alerting customs or INS to the fact that they were being brought into the country, they also needed their money taken offshore so that it would not be subject to United States tax where they might have to declare its source. And so we performed these kinds of functions for them.
• Mr. Brenneke, are you saying that the CIA was in the business of bringing drugs into the United States?
• Yes, sir. That’s exactly what I’m saying.”

The above says what most of us have known, but it is a validation to see it in an actual testimony.

I pray that we are about to witness a testimony by Billy Jack Haynes, which will open up a door to a hidden world…or actually not hidden to many of us…but one which has not been truly shown to the public until now.

I know that Linda Ives finds this bittersweet, as it is finally a truth discovered….one that she finds difficult to fathom. Her worst fears have been validated, and now she must live knowing what her precious son endured at the end of his life. Only God understands what she is truly feeling, and only God can comfort her. May Linda Ives and Billy Jack Haynes be surrounded by God’s great army of angels. In the days to come, I pray we will all know the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It is time.

820,"A follower of QAnon, a conspiracy theory that has been spreading from the far fringes of right-wing social media into more mainstream Republican circles, won the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Oregon Tuesday, crediting fellow followers for her victory.

“Where we go one, we go all,” said candidate Jo Rae Perkins in a tweet published prior to the results coming in, quoting a popular slogan from the conspiracy theory. “I stand with President Trump, I stand with Q and the team. Thank you Anons, and thank you patriots. Together, we can save our republic.”

During a victory speech live-streamed to social media, Perkins concluded by saying, “As we Q people like to say, ‘Where we go one, we go all.’”

QAnon is a theory built around belief in an international conspiracy of high-ranking government officials to kidnap, abuse, torture and kill children — the delusion under which an armed North Carolina man attempted a rescue mission at a Washington pizzeria in 2016, the baseless Pizzagate conspiracy seen as a precursor to QAnon. President Trump, in the Q worldview, is working behind the scenes to expose and disrupt this conspiracy but has been thwarted by “deep-state” bureaucrats and global elites. The narrative is fed by cryptic posts on internet message boards from the anonymous “Q,” who followers believe to be a high-ranking intelligence official, or possibly even Trump himself. Popular YouTube and social media pages promulgate and analyze Q’s vague messages, turning the obsession into something of a game for many followers.

Perkins is the former Republican chairwoman in Linn County, located just south of the capital city, Salem, and had run in prior Republican primaries in 2014 (U.S. Senate), 2016 and 2018 (the state’s Fourth Congressional District). She was originally running for the House seat again in 2020 but withdrew to enter the Senate race. As of the latest results, Perkins had earned just short of 50 percent of the vote in the four-candidate race. The runner-up was former naval officer Paul Romero, who reached 30 percent.",conspiracy
918,"In his T-shirt, skinny jeans and sharply styled haircut, Martin Sellner is the European far right's newest poster boy. The group he leads in Austria has attracted huge publicity. However, Sellner's insistence that his movement is non-racist and non-violent doesn't have everyone convinced.

In April 2016, hundreds of people sat inside the University of Vienna's theatre watching The Suppliants, a play performed by asylum-seekers from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. And then the stage invasion began.

Members of a far-right group called Generation Identity (GI) rushed in, unfurling a banner calling the audience hypocrites and throwing fake blood over some of them. The performers screamed, fearing they were under attack. There were scuffles as some in the audience began shouting ""Nazis raus"" or ""Nazis out"" and tried to eject the protesters.

Ima was one of the performers. She had fled Mosul in Iraq when it was taken over by the so-called Islamic State group. ""We came from the land of fear,"" she says. And now, in the darkness and confusion, she was scared again.

""We thought they were going to kill us. In my homeland it's just so much killing and dead people so that's what we believed.""

The young man who leads GI in Austria plays down the incident. ""I actually don't think people were really traumatised,"" he says. ""I don't know anybody who had a severe trauma or a medical condition.""

His name is Martin Sellner, and with his striking haircut, fashionable skinny jeans and thick-rimmed glasses, he looks like a typical style-conscious 29-year-old. Like many others of his generation, he can normally be found staring into the lens of a mobile phone - but in Sellner's case, it's typically to deliver a monologue about the evils of multiculturalism and how Muslims want to take over Europe.

He is often joined in his videos on YouTube by his fiancee, Brittany Pettibone, an alt-right vlogger and conspiracy theorist. Her posts about a so-called ""white genocide"" and a paedophile ring connected to Hillary Clinton led the Anti-Defamation League to place her on its list of hate groups.

Earlier this year Sellner and Pettibone were both banned from entering the UK. The Home Office said that when ""the purpose of someone's visit to this country is to spread hatred, the Home Office can and will stop them entering Britain"".

Sellner isn't just GI's leader in Austria. He's also a poster boy for the Europe-wide Identitarian movement, which is fiercely opposed to Muslim migrants - claiming that they threaten Europe's identity and will eventually replace the indigenous populations. The movement began in France in 2012 and has expanded to nine countries including Germany, Italy and recently the UK. It doesn't have many members but gets publicity through confrontational and expensive stunts.

In the summer of 2017, GI raised over £150,000 through crowdfunding to charter a boat in the Mediterranean to target non-governmental organisations that patrol the sea to rescue migrants in peril. GI said it would arrest illegal migrants and sink their boats - its campaign received the backing of a neo-Nazi website, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and a leading American white supremacist.

It didn't quite go to plan, though. GI's boat was detained and the captain was arrested, accused of having illegal Sri Lankan refugees on board and false documents. They were all later released.

A few months later, GI paid for a red helicopter to land on the crisp white snow of the French Alps. Flanked by 100 activists from across Europe, a massive poster was laid out telling migrants to go home. This stunt cost more than £50,000.

But the organisation's actions in Austria have landed it in deep trouble.

The Austrian authorities think that actions like the protest at the University of Vienna theatre and Generation Identity's accompanying rhetoric amount to incitement of hatred against Muslims, foreigners and refugees. It's why they have taken the unprecedented step of charging GI with being a criminal group, rather than the non-governmental organisation it says it is.

The Austrian prosecutor compiled evidence from stunts GI carried out in the past two years. These included the targeting of a lecture at Klagenfurt University, a small campus set amidst the jagged mountains and cool lakes of Carinthia. Identitarians disrupted a talk on refugees and integration, unfurling a banner while a man with a megaphone barked at a shocked audience.

Enis Husic, a softly spoken student from Bosnia, challenged them that day. ""It was very tense and aggressive. I could really sense that,"" he says. ""At the time I wasn't scared but I was very scared afterwards once it was all over.""

The fresh-faced rector, Prof Oliver Vitouch, was looking out of his office window when he saw protesters and rushed to confront them. He was hit by one of them as they tried to escape. ""Although they usually say they're completely free of violence and completely peaceful, it's pretty clear to me that the readiness to violence is obviously there,"" he says.

For years, GI was dismissed by its critics as a bunch of wannabe hipster Nazis - but Natasha Strobl, an author and researcher, has long thought their actions and rhetoric pose a threat to the country.

""They paint refugees as invaders, as dangerous soldiers of Islam who come here to destroy Europe. It really destroys society,"" she says. As a result of this rhetoric, she adds, ""people get aggressive, people harass Muslim women on the streets"".

She wrote a book about the Identitarian movement and then began receiving threats. ""There are rape and murder threats when you open your email… I try not to go the same ways in the city because I don't want to be followed. So you change how you live."" Generation Identity says it's not racist or violent but articulating the views of many Austrians.

Martin Sellner grew up in an affluent suburb outside of Vienna. In his teenage years, Strobl says, he was drawn to the nationalist fringe in Austria. ""He was part of the neo-Nazi scene and the most well-known figure of the neo-Nazis, Gottfried Kussel, was his mentor,"" she says.

At the time Kussel had already been to prison for trying to revive Nazism. He was arrested again in 2011 and later jailed for nine years for continued far-right activity. It was after this, in 2012, that Martin Sellner set up the Identitarians in Austria.

We meet him inside their offices in a scrappy apartment in the centre of Vienna. It's fairly basic apart from a room full of cameras, laptops and lights where they make and edit their videos. Sellner is relaxed and confident; the day before he had been acquitted, along with 16 other GI members and supporters, of belonging to a criminal organisation.

""I really think we were vindicated and I hope that this verdict will also have an effect beyond this case and beyond Austria in the rehabilitation of GI,"" he says, sipping from a glass of sparkling water.

The prosecutor is appealing against the acquittal and is investigating GI's finances.

GI likes to stress it's not violent or racist, but what of Martin Sellner's past?

He admits he was involved with neo-Nazis when he was younger because, he says, ""there was no alternative. There was no right-wing patriotic movement"".

When asked bluntly: ""So you weren't a racist?"" his fluency falters.

When pressed further - ""Surely you'd know if you were a racist?"" - he still sounds a little unsure. ""I wouldn't say I was. It was a very ambiguous thing. I would say I was like a conservative, patriot.""

Earlier this year, before he was banned from the UK, he was secretly filmed by undercover reporters during a trip to London. He was captured using a racist and offensive term. He says it was a genuine mistake. ""I really thought that 'Paki' was a completely normal term. If I would have known it, that it was considered a racial slur, I would have definitely not used it.""

""Come off it,"" we tell him. ""You come to the UK a lot - the idea you wouldn't know it was offensive isn't believable.""

He once again insists he didn't know and apologises. ""If I insulted anybody with this word, I absolutely say sorry and I will never use it again.""

GI's actions often target events which promote integration - because, he says, he doesn't believe in this. The Muslims who come to Europe must do more, he says - they must assimilate.

""Assimilation means that you completely identify with the country, the nation, its history,"" he says - otherwise, he warns, ""it's treason, because you're betraying this community… because this community is giving you open hands, taking you in and then you have to put the interests of this community in front of your own.""

Standing in his way are anti-fascist campaigners like Jerome Trebing.

Publicly, Sellner's group says it is not violent or racist. But Trebing has worked with activists who have gone into meetings GI holds in isolated rural areas.

As he sips sweet tea in a Turkish cafe in Vienna's multicultural 10th district, a place that GI abhors, Trebing says: ""There is some really hard stuff going on. There are people who are allowed to say racist stuff, anti-Semitic stuff and there is no-one who is saying there is no place for it here.""

According to Trebing, in these meetings GI supporters said it wasn't just Muslims who wanted to replace the local population, but Jews too.

The saga of 'Pizzagate': The fake story that shows how conspiracy theories spread

Who's behind the fighting at US universities?

GI's leader denies it has any bias against the Jewish population. He wants to expand the Identitarian movement to other European nations. In Austria, he says, ""We have a right-wing government. And we want to push for that everywhere in Europe, we really want to change public discourse.""

Sellner's ban on visiting the UK has made it harder for him to spread his message to potential supporters, but online he is still very active - although he has been banned from Facebook.

In mainland Europe he is free to lead GI's continued aggressive, provocative targeting of Muslims.

Besima is one of those who have been on the receiving end of GI activity.

Sitting in her faded apartment drinking sweet tea with freshly made lamb koftas, she describes how she was performing with other asylum seekers at the University theatre in Vienna when GI stormed in.

Her son Mohammed was on stage with her too and she said the experience had traumatised him. ""He has refused to go out, he is still at home, saying 'If I go out something bad will happen to me.'""

Mohammed had been kidnapped in Iraq, which is one of the reasons she originally fled Basra with her three children. When she arrived two years ago she felt welcomed and accepted but feels the atmosphere towards migrants is changing.

""I thought I found happiness and peace here,"" she says, ""but I feel it's not safe any more.""

523,"Quentin Tarantino says he knew about instances of sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein for decades but failed to act in order to protect women, adding: “I knew enough to do more than I did.”

In an interview the director, who worked with Weinstein on some of his most successful films, including Pulp Fiction, said that he regretted not taking responsibility and assisting alleged victims of the producer, who is accused of sexually harassing and assaulting more than 50 women.

“There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip,” he said in the interview with the New York Times. “It wasn’t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things.

“I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard. If I had done the work I should have done then, I would have had to not work with him.”

Tarantino said that he had been aware of the settlement between Rose McGowan and Weinstein and that his then girlfriend Mira Sorvino had told him about an incident involving Weinstein making unwelcome advances and touching.

“I couldn’t believe he would do that so openly. I was like: ‘Really? Really?’ But the thing I thought then, at the time, was that he was particularly hung up on Mira,” said Tarantino. “I thought Harvey was hung up on her in this Svengali kind of way. Because he was infatuated with her, he horribly crossed the line.”

Weinstein distributed Tarantino’s films from his debut Reservoir Dogs to his most recent, The Hateful Eight, and the director said his attitude to the rumours was initially dismissive. “I chalked it up to a 50s-60s era image of a boss chasing a secretary around the desk,” he said. “As if that’s OK. That’s the egg on my face right now.”

On Thursday the Los Angeles police department announced it was opening an investigation into whether Weinstein raped an Italian model in 2013. The unnamed model claims the mogul bullied his way into her hotel room and raped her.

“The Los Angeles police department’s robbery homicide division has interviewed a potential sexual assault victim involving Harvey Weinstein which allegedly occurred in 2013,” an LAPD spokesman told the Los Angeles Times. “The case is under investigation.”

In an earlier statement to the New Yorker, Weinstein’s spokesperson Sallie Hofmeister said: “Mr Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but he unequivocally denies allegations of non-consensual sex.”

Earlier in the day, workers at the Weinstein Company released a statement to the New Yorker saying they had asked to be let out of their non-disclosure agreements in order to shed more light on the producer’s actions.

“We have nothing to hide, and are as angry and baffled as you are at how Harvey’s behavior could continue for so long,” it read. “We ask that the company let us out of our NDAs immediately – and do the same for all former Weinstein Company employees – so we may speak openly, and get to the origins of what happened here, and how.”

Tarantino’s comments follow the news that Weinstein’s prestigious fellowship from the British Film Institute – described as its “highest honour” – had been withdrawn. The BFI said “the serious and widespread allegations about Harvey Weinstein’s appalling conduct are in direct opposition to the BFI’s values.”",mainstream
760,"Washington Times mischaracterizes his quote as part of ‘PizzaGate’ demonization campaign

The Washington Times has launched a ‘fake news’ smear against Alex Jones by mischaracterizing his quote to suggest that Jones accused Hillary Clinton of chopping up children as part of the ‘PizzaGate’ controversy.

An article by Andrew Blake entitled Infowars’ Alex Jones appeals to Trump for aid over fears of ‘fake news’ crackdown states that Jones, “Claimed the president-elect’s former White House rival Hillary Clinton “personally murdered and chopped up” children during a November broadcast.”

However, as even the Washington Post admitted, Jones’ quote was in the context of Hillary’s murderous policies in Libya and Syria, which led to an international migrant crisis and the rise of ISIS, a group that literally chops up children.

“Jones eventually tied his comments about Clinton to U.S. policy in Syria,” acknowledged the Post.

This crucial clarification is completely missing from the Washington Times article, which goes on to roll the quote into a discussion about PizzaGate, implying that Jones was accusing Clinton of chopping up children in the basements of pizza parlors – when he was talking in the context of her disastrous foreign policy.

The failure of the Washington Times to put the quote in its correct context and to then roll it into a completely unrelated context is extremely deceptive and suggests that the supposedly conservative Washington Times is now pushing the same “fake news” narrative as the rest of the mainstream media.

As the Post article also reveals, the first time the #PizzaGate hashtag appeared on Twitter was November 7, while Infowars didn’t carry any stories about the issue until November 24, when we featured a story about why PizzaGate was being censored by Reddit.

The media is obsessed with suggesting that Infowars was the source of the ‘PizzaGate’ controversy, despite the fact that it was discussed weeks before we even covered it. The whole narrative is an obvious ploy to claim that so-called “fake news” represents a violent threat, as Hillary Clinton asserted earlier this week, and that Infowars is to blame.

However, Glenn Greenwald has exposed, the origin of the fake news issue can actually be traced back to Hillary Clinton supporter Marco Chacon, who started circulating fake quotes attributed to Clinton contained in John Podesta emails in an effort bait Trump supporters into sharing them.

“Sadly for Chacon, however, the people who ended up getting fooled by his Fake News items were the nation’s most prominent Clinton supporters, including supposed experts and journalists from MSNBC who used his obvious fakes to try to convince the world that the Wikileaks archive had been compromised and thus should be ignored,” writes Greenwald.

In other words, the entire fake news narrative was started by Democratic operatives in a bid to discredit the Podesta emails. Those same operatives are now using the same fake news scandal they created to try to censor legitimate news sources like Infowars and Breitbart.

While Infowars is under constant attack for being responsible for “fake news,” many mainstream reporters and commentators on the left amplified this fake news narrative for weeks with wanton abandon. Clintonite celebrities like Amy Schumer also circulated fake quotes in a bid to smear Donald Trump but were never called out for it by the mainstream media.

Both Greenwald and the Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi have also completely debunked the McCarthyite blacklists of “fake news” published by mainstream media outlets.

The first list of “fake news” websites was exposed as the bias-driven musings of a far-left social justice warrior, while the Washington Post itself was forced to admit that it couldn’t “vouch for the validity” of the “Russian propaganda” list it published.

The MSM’s “fake news” narrative is crumbling, but they will continue to double down in an effort to force tech giants like Google and Facebook into strangling the corporate media’s competition.

• Reddit has taken action to restrict a wildly popular pro-Trump subreddit, r/The_Donald, saying it contains ""rule-breaking behavior"" and content in violation of the platform's policies.
• The subreddit has been ""quarantined,"" meaning it won't generate revenue or appear in search and recommendation results, and Reddit now requires users to explicitly opt in to view the community's content.
• Reddit said the quarantine was issued because of ""threats of violence against police and public officials.""

Reddit has punished a subreddit popular among President Donald Trump supporters with a ""quarantine,"" citing ""threats of violence against police and public officials.""

The subreddit r/The_Donald, an online forum that has more than 750,000 subscribers, was quarantined on Wednesday. That means that neither the subreddit nor its posts will appear in search and recommendation results, including Reddit's ""Popular"" feed. The subreddit will also not be able to generate revenue.

Trying to access the r/The_Donald subreddit will now present you with a warning message (like the one above) that notifies you of the thread's quarantine because of violations of Reddit's conduct policy, including ""threats of violence against police and public officials."" As part of the quarantine, users who want to access the subreddit will have to explicitly, and manually, opt in to view the page.

The quarantine seems to be in response to recent posts threatening violence toward public officials in Oregon, according to a message from Reddit that a r/The_Donald moderator shared online. In Oregon, nearly a dozen Republican lawmakers recently fled the state to prevent climate-change legislation from passing.

After the state's Democratic senator said she would use law enforcement to make the lawmakers return for the vote, multiple users on r/The_Donald said they would resort to violence to protect GOP politicians, according to the right-wing watchdog group Media Matters, which shared some of these Reddit posts in an article published on Monday. In a thread about Oregon, one user wrote, ""everyone needs to start getting into shape, sharpening up your marksmanship and learning the ins and outs of all your fire arms. Stock upon that ammo too,"" according to Media Matters.

A Reddit spokesperson referred Business Insider to its platform's policies, which ban content encouraging or threatening violence.

""As we have shared, we are sensitive to what could be considered political speech, however, recent behaviors including threats against the police and public figures is content that is prohibited by our violence policy,"" the Reddit spokesperson said. ""As a result, we have actioned individual users and quarantined the subreddit.""

Criticism from supporters and contributors of r/The_Donald was swift in response to the quarantine. Moderators for r/The_Donald turned to Twitter to voice their unhappiness and float the theory that the quarantine was purposefully aligned with the first Democratic presidential debate happening Wednesday night.

Although r/The_Donald had never been quarantined before, other popular right-wing subreddits have been banned from the platform. The r/pizzagate community was banned in 2016 because of its promotion of a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was leading a child-abuse ring out of a Washington, DC, pizza shop. In 2017, the r/altright subreddit was banned because of ""the proliferation of personal and confidential information,"" and the alt-right subreddit r/clownworldwar was banned earlier on Wednesday.",mainstream
705,"Conspiracy theories about the death of Diana

After 1998, it was theorised that there was an orchestrated criminal conspiracy surrounding the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.[1] Official investigations in both Britain and France found that Diana died in a manner consistent with media reports following the fatal car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. In 1999, a French investigation concluded that Diana died as the result of an accident.[2] The French investigator, Judge Hervé Stephan, concluded that the paparazzi were some distance from the Mercedes S280 when it crashed and were not responsible.[3] After hearing evidence at the British inquest, a jury in 2008 returned a verdict of ""unlawful killing"" by driver Henri Paul and the paparazzi pursuing the car.[4] The jury's verdict also stated: ""In addition, the death of the deceased was caused or contributed to by the fact that the deceased were not wearing a seat belt and by the fact that the Mercedes struck the pillar in the Alma Tunnel rather than colliding with something else"".[5]

Prominent in disputing the official version of events have been the British newspaper Daily Express[6][7] and Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed, whose son, Dodi, was Diana's boyfriend at the time and also died with her in the crash. In 2003, Diana's butler Paul Burrell published a note that had been written by Diana, in which she had claimed that someone was ""planning 'an accident' in [her] car, brake failure and serious head injury"" so that her former husband could marry again.[8][9] A special Metropolitan Police inquiry team was established in 2004, Operation Paget, headed by Commissioner John Stevens to investigate the various conspiracy theories which led up to the British inquest. This investigation looked into 175 conspiracy claims that had been made by Fayed.[10] Fayed has persistently suggested what were found to be conspiracy theories at the inquest[11][12] and has repeatedly claimed that he believes his son was murdered with Diana.[13]

Theorists have alleged that the driver of the Mercedes-Benz, acting head of Ritz security Henri Paul, was in the pay of a national security service, though different versions of the allegation name the country of the security service alternately as Britain, France or the United States. Evidence purported to support this arises mainly from money in his possession at the time of his death and his personal wealth. These allegations are covered in chapter four of the Operation Paget criminal investigation report. Mohamed Al-Fayed claims that Henri Paul was working for MI6 and that they set him up.[14] The inquiry found no evidence Henri Paul was an agent for any security service.[15]

Another allegation concerns the reliability of blood tests carried out, which indicated Paul had been drinking before he took the controls of the car. The French investigators' conclusion that Paul was drunk was made on the basis of an analysis of blood samples, which were said to contain an alcohol level that (according to Jay's September 1997 report) was three times the French legal limit. This initial analysis was challenged by a British pathologist hired by Al-Fayed. In response, French authorities carried out a third test, this time using the more medically conclusive vitreous fluid from inside the eye, which confirmed the level of alcohol measured by blood and also showed Paul had been taking antidepressants.[16]

It has been claimed that the level of alcohol reported to have been found in Paul's blood was inconsistent with his sober demeanour, as captured on the CCTV of the Ritz that evening.[17] Professor Robert Forrest, a forensic pathologist, said that an alcoholic like Paul, with a higher tolerance for alcohol, would be able to appear more sober than he actually was.[18][19] The families of Dodi Fayed and Henri Paul did not accept the findings of the French investigation.

It was disclosed in November 2006 that Lord Stevens had met with Paul's elderly parents telling them that their son was not drunk.[20] Just prior to Stevens's appearance at the inquest, a source close to Stevens stated that this inconsistency could be explained as him being ""considerate"" and ""sensitive"" towards the elderly couple,[20] an assessment Scott Baker suggested might be credible in his opening comments to the jury.[21] Under cross-examination at the inquest in February 2008, Stevens denied ""deliberately misleading"" Paul's parents and said that the chauffeur's condition at the time of the crash did not match the police's definition of being drunk, which he said relied upon someone's physical responses.[22] Stevens said that the available evidence suggested Paul had consumed only two alcoholic drinks, but this was not necessarily all that Paul had consumed, and that he was indeed ""under the influence"" of alcohol at the time of the crash.[22] An expert cited in the report estimated that Paul had drunk the equivalent of five measures of Ricard, his favourite liquorice-flavoured French aperitif, before driving.[23]

In the two French TOXLAB tests, Paul was found to have 12.8% carbon haemoglobin saturation, a combination of blood's iron-carrying pigment and carbon monoxide. A smoker normally has about 10%, so the result was not unusual.[24] Paul had been smoking small cigars, Cigarillos, in the hours before the crash.[25] Another test, backed by the opponents of the official findings, showed Paul had 20.7% in his blood at the time of death; if accurate, the rate of dispersal of carbon monoxide from the bloodstream would have meant that Paul's blood had 40% saturation a few hours earlier, and he would scarcely have been able to function at all.[24]

On 9 December 2009, it was reported that DNA samples confirm the blood samples with high alcohol levels were indeed from the driver.[26] This was established by a comparison with samples provided by Paul's parents, demonstrating that the blood tested was that of Henri Paul and that he had three times the French legal limit of alcohol in his blood.[26]

Richard Tomlinson, a former MI6 officer who was dismissed from the intelligence services and later served five months in prison for breaching the Official Secrets Act 1989,[27] claimed in a sworn statement to the French inquiry in May 1999 that Britain's MI6 had been involved in the crash, suggesting that the security service had documentation which would assist Judge Stephan in his inquiry.[28] The previous August, he had been reported by the BBC to have claimed that Paul was working for the security services and that one of Diana's bodyguards, either Trevor Rees-Jones (now known as Trevor Rees) or Kes Wingfield, was a contact for British intelligence.[29] Tomlinson alleged that MI6 was monitoring Diana before her death, had told Mohamed Al-Fayed that Paul was an MI6 agent,[30] and that her death mirrored plans he saw in 1992 for the assassination of then President of Serbia Slobodan Milošević, using a strobe light to blind his chauffeur.[31]

On 13 February 2008, Tomlinson told the inquest that he may have misremembered and that he had no evidence that Paul was an MI6 agent,[30] but he had said in the previous day's court session that Paul was supplying MI6 with information.[31] Speaking by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he ""could not remember specifically"" whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milošević, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training.[30] The Operation Paget Inquiry was given unprecedented access to the offices of both MI5 and MI6 to investigate Tomlinson's claims. It was later revealed that the mentioned memo was a proposal written in March 1993 to assassinate another Serbian figure if he gained power, not Milošević.[32][33][34] Furthermore, the plan didn't involve anything about using flashlights.[35]

Further evidence discrediting Tomlinson's claims was found in drafts of a book he was writing about his time in MI6 before he was jailed in 1998 for breaching the Official Secrets Act. The draft, dating from 1996, referred to the memo and contained none of the detail about a staged car crash with flashlights in a tunnel.[35]

The inquest was later told by an anonymous MI6 manager (referred to during proceedings as ""Miss X"") that MI6 weren't keeping any file on either the Princess or Dodi, and that there wasn't any plan involving them.[36] The inquiry concluded by dismissing Tomlinson's claims as an embellishment. It went on to comment that this embellishment was largely responsible for giving rise to the theories Diana was murdered.[37]

Tomlinson was arrested by French authorities in July 2006 as part of their inquiry into the death of Diana.[38] French police were also reported to have seized computer files and personal papers from his home in Cannes.

One of the main motives which has been advanced for alleged murder includes suggestions Diana was pregnant with Mohamed ""Dodi"" Fayed's child and the couple were about to get engaged. The alleged dislike of the idea of a non-Christian within the British Royal Family meant such a relationship between the mother of the future king and a prominent Egyptian Muslim would not be tolerated.[39] In Mohamed Al-Fayed's view, which he repeated in court at the inquest in February 2008, Prince Philip, the Prince of Wales, Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale and numerous others were all involved in a plot to kill the Princess and his son.[40] Jeffrey Steinberg of the Executive Intelligence Review, a publication of the American Lyndon LaRouche movement, has also put forward theories that the Princess of Wales was murdered by the security services under the instructions of Prince Philip.[41] An article in The Daily Telegraph in 1998 reporting the EIR conspiracy theories alleged earlier links between the EIR and Al-Fayed,[42] while Francis Wheen reported the following year that Al-Fayed's spokesman had advised journalists to contact Steinberg.[43]

Al-Fayed made the assertion in television interviews that the couple were going to announce their engagement on the Monday after the accident, 1 September 1997. Operation Paget commented that an announcement of such magnitude from the Princess of Wales would have been a substantial media event of worldwide interest and would have required significant preparation. No evidence was found that any such preparation had been made.[44]

CCTV evidence shown at the inquest indicates that Dodi left Alberto Repossi jewellers on the 30 August with nothing more than a catalogue.[45] Repossi said in 2003 that the ring had been placed on Diana's finger in a St Tropez hotel, and was being resized for future collection in Paris, but later admitted to writer Martyn Gregory that he had received ""legal papers"" from Al-Fayed, a client for more than 20 years.[3] Al-Fayed said the couple chose the ring in Monte Carlo, and Dodi had picked it up in Paris the day before he died after it had been altered.[45] This statement of Al-Fayed was contradicted by the statements of Claude Roulet, a shop assistant, and the CCTV footage.[46] A CCTV recording demonstrated that a ring had been selected by a Ritz hotel official. It was bought by Mohammed Al-Fayed after the couple's death.[3]

A few hours before the accident, on the afternoon of 30 August, Diana's journalist friend Richard Kay received a call on his mobile phone from Diana in which she asked about what was likely to appear in the following day's Sunday papers about her.[47] During this call, she made no mention of any announcement she intended to make.[48]

More revealing was the statement given by Diana's eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who testified that in a phone conversation with Diana on Friday 29 August, Diana spoke about Dodi Fayed in a manner that gave her sister the impression the relationship was on ""stony ground"".[49] Statements from other friends and confidantes Diana spoke to in the week before her death, including her butler Paul Burrell, her friend Lady Annabel Goldsmith, and her spiritual adviser Rita Rogers, were unanimous that she was firm about not wanting to get engaged or married to anyone at that point in her life. A week before she died, the princess had told Goldsmith: ""I need marriage like a rash on my face.""[50]

Diana's former private secretary, Patrick Jephson, said to the BBC in reaction to the publication of the Operation Paget Report in December 2006 that her facial expression in the CCTV footage of her at the Paris Ritz on her final evening with Dodi Fayed was one she would wear when she was disgruntled with a situation.[51] However, CCTV images released on 6 October taken just minutes before their deaths, show a relaxed Diana and Dodi affectionately holding hands.[52]

An inquiry witness was Hasnat Khan, a Muslim heart surgeon of Pakistani origin based in London, who had a relationship with Diana for two years. Diana had explored the possibility of marriage with him. This had been met with no opposition from the Royal Family and Prince Charles had given his blessing.[50] Khan stated that he had received some racist hate mail from members of the public because of the relationship but had no reason to take what was said in this hate mail seriously. He also stated that he felt the relationship was not opposed by the Royal Family or any other branch of the British Government including the security services. Paul Burrell stated that Diana was still not over her break-up with Khan at the time of her death.[53] It was also pointed out that Dodi and Diana had only met just under seven weeks before the accident, at Al-Fayed's villa in St. Tropez on 14 July, meaning there were only 47 days from their first meeting until the night of the accident. Of those days, their schedules permitted them to be together for an absolute maximum of 35 days. From analysis of Diana's actual movements, it is likely they had spent approximately 23 days together before the accident.[54]

John Macnamara, a former senior detective at Scotland Yard, headed Al-Fayed's own investigation for five years from 1997. Cross-examined at the inquest on 14 February, he conceded that he had found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy to kill the Princess, or that she was engaged or pregnant at the time of her death, apart from the claims Al-Fayed had relayed to him.[55]

In January 2004, the former coroner of the Queen's Household, Dr. John Burton, said (in an interview with The Times) that he attended a post-mortem examination of the Princess's body at Fulham mortuary, where he personally examined her womb and found her not to be pregnant.[49][56]

In an effort to examine the assertions made by Al-Fayed, Operation Paget had scientific tests carried out on pre-transfusion blood found in the footwell of the seat in the wrecked Mercedes the Princess of Wales occupied at the time of the accident. This blood was found to have no trace of the hCG hormone associated with pregnancy.[57] The inquiry also extensively interviewed friends of Diana's who were in close contact with her in the weeks leading up to her death. The evidence obtained from these witnesses was of a very sensitive nature and most of it was not included in Operation Paget's criminal investigation report. However, it was reported that friends said she was in her normal menstrual cycle and there was evidence she was using contraception.[58]

Al-Fayed's persistence in asserting Diana was pregnant led him to get members of his staff to tell the media that on their final day together, Diana and his son had visited a villa he owned in Paris to choose a room ""for the baby"". While the couple had indeed visited the villa, the circumstances of the visit were exaggerated to say it had lasted two hours and that it was in the presence of a prominent Italian interior designer. A security guard at the villa, Reuben Murrell, felt uncomfortable lying about the matter and sold his story to The Sun stating that the visit lasted just under thirty minutes and was not in the company of any interior designer. He provided stills from CCTV to prove this and said he had been in the presence of Diana and Dodi for the entirety of their visit, with there having been no conversation about them coming to live at the villa. He later resigned from Al-Fayed's employment and initiated an employment tribunal for constructive dismissal after Al-Fayed successfully sued him for breach of contract because of the CCTV images he supplied to The Sun.[59][60][61] Senior members of Al-Fayed's staff made derogatory comments about Murrell and Trevor Rees-Jones in their statements to Operation Paget.[62] In 2004, a Channel 4 documentary, The Diana Conspiracy, claimed that the butler at the villa who, in a June 1998 interview with the ITV documentary Diana: Secrets Behind the Crash, claimed to have shown the couple around with their intent being to live there, was not even present at the villa on that day as he was on vacation.[63]

Al-Fayed first claimed that the Princess of Wales was pregnant at the time of her death to the Daily Express in May 2001. ""If it is true, it is strange that he sat upon this important information for three and a half years,"" Scott Baker said at the inquest.[50]

The absence of CCTV images showing the Mercedes's journey from the hotel to the crash site has been frequently cited as evidence of an organised conspiracy. According to The Independent newspaper in 2006, there were more than 14 CCTV cameras in the Pont de l'Alma underpass, though none recorded footage of the fatal collision.[64]

Judge Hervé Stéphan was appointed as Examining Magistrate in this case on 2 September 1997. On that day, by Judicial Order, he tasked the Brigade Criminelle with identifying all video and photographic images along the route taken by the Mercedes. Lieutenant Eric Gigou of the Brigade Criminelle led the team that carried out that work, initially by retracing the route several times and drawing up a list of possible locations. His report showed that the team identified ten locations of CCTV cameras. None of these had any images relevant to the inquiry, since they were principally security cameras facing the entrances to buildings. Most of the cameras were not maintained by the City of Paris; the owners of the buildings to which they were attached operated them privately. There was a traffic-monitoring camera above the underpass in the Place de l'Alma itself but this was under the control of la Compagnie de Circulation Urbaine de Paris (Paris Urban Traffic Unit). That department closed down at about 11 p.m., had no night duty staff and made no recordings. Officers in the Police Headquarters Information and Command Centre could continue to view the pictures shown by the traffic camera in real time but could not control it.

The subject of the CCTV cameras is dealt with in Chapter 5 of the Operation Paget report. It was also found that a photograph that was published in a book by David Cohen Diana, Death of a Goddess and captioned as having been taken just before the car entered the tunnel was in fact taken by a photographer as the car left the back of the Paris Ritz.[65]

Analysis of the wreckage of the Mercedes revealed it had glancing contact with a white Fiat Uno car which left traces of paint on the Mercedes bodywork. Extensive attempts by the French police to find the vehicle involved were unsuccessful.[66] Although no one had seen the Fiat in the tunnel, some witnesses reported seeing an Uno exiting the tunnel.[67]

Mohamed Al-Fayed alleged in his July 2005 statement to Operation Paget, and at other times, that the white Fiat Uno was being used by MI6[68] as a means of causing the Mercedes to swerve and thereby crash into the side of the tunnel. Al-Fayed further alleged that the Fiat Uno was owned by a French photojournalist named Jean-Paul James Andanson,[69] a security services agent according to Fayed,[24] who had photographed Diana while she was at his villa in St. Tropez in July 1997. Andanson's death in May 2000, Al-Fayed claimed, was either due to guilt over what he had done or because he was assassinated by the French or British security services to silence him.[48]

Operation Paget found that the white Fiat Uno Andanson owned was in an unroadworthy condition, being nine years old at the time, with 325,000 km on the odometer[70] (suggesting that the car had been driven 27,000 miles per annum) and had not been maintained for several years prior. Andanson's neighbours confirmed the veracity of this evidence.[70] Andanson had sold the car in October 1997.[69] Operation Paget concluded it was extremely unlikely due to the car's condition and the fact Andanson had so openly disposed of it that it was the one at the scene of the accident in Paris. French police had examined Andanson's car as part of their effort to trace the one that had come into contact with the Mercedes with a view to prosecuting the driver for failing to render assistance and had reached the same conclusion. The French police spent a year after the accident searching for the vehicle and eliminated over 4,000 white Fiat Unos from their inquiry. Operation Paget decided it would be unlikely renewed enquiries would identify the vehicle involved as such a long period had elapsed since the accident. It concluded the threat of prosecution for a custodial offence probably deterred the driver from coming forward at the time.[71]

A retired major in the French Brigade Criminelle, Jean Claude Mules, gave evidence to the inquest in February 2008. Andanson had been interviewed by French police in February 1998, and had been able to provide documentary evidence about his movements on the previous 30 and 31 August which had satisfied them that he could not have been the driver of the Fiat Uno involved. These demonstrated that Andanson could only have been at his home in Lignieres, 177 miles from Paris, at the time of the crash.[69] Elizabeth, his widow, said at the London inquest in February 2008 that her husband had been at home in bed with her at the time of the accident.[72]

Andanson died in May 2000. The official verdict was suicide.[73] His body was found in a black, burnt-out BMW in a forest near the town of Nant, near Millau, in the south of France. Andanson's death was attributed to problems in his private life. The 2008 inquest into the death of the Princess of Wales heard that evidence was uncovered from his friends and associates that prior to his death he had talked of suicide by pouring petrol in a car and lighting a cigar, as noted by Richard Horwell QC, for the Metropolitan Commissioner.[74]

The Paget report states that when the car was found, Andanson's body was in the driver's seat of the car, and his head was detached and lay between the front seats. There was a hole in his left temple. The French pathologist concluded this hole was caused by the intense heat of the fire rather than, for example, a bullet wound.[75]

Operation Paget found no evidence Andanson was known to any security service and, contrary to Al-Fayed's claims, his death was thoroughly investigated by French police (although the whereabouts of the car keys has never been explained). A break-in at his former workplace in June 2000 alleged to have been carried out by security services was found to be unconnected to his death, as no items related to him were stolen.[76]

It has been reported by numerous publications that the white Fiat Uno belonged to Le Van Thanh who was a 22-year-old taxi driver at the time of the accident. Thanh owned a white Fiat Uno identical to the one that struck the Princess of Wales' Mercedes. Georges and Sabine Dauzonne identified Thanh as ""the agitated man they may have seen driving the car"".[77] Thanh has always refused interview requests.[78][79] In 2006, Thanh's father said his son had re-sprayed his white Uno red hours after the accident, allegedly waking up his mechanic brother in the night to help him.[80] Following tests, it was concluded that the car ""could have been involved in the accident"", but Thanh's involvement in the accident ""was ruled out by French police because he said he was at work on the night in question"".[78] It later was uncovered he had left work early that night and could have been at the scene of the crime. Multiple witnesses recall seeing a man matching his description exit the tunnel seconds after the crash.[6]

An alternative explanation for the cause of the crash has been reports of a bright white flash just before the car entered the tunnel, blinding the driver. Richard Tomlinson made this allegation at the inquiry, but the veracity of his evidence was found wanting.

It was found by the authorities that three eyewitnesses at the scene of the crash claimed to see a bright flash of light before the accident.[81] François Levistre (originally François Levi)[82] made a clear, specific claim that he saw a bright flash, but his three statements to the authorities were in conflict with each other.[83] Both the French detectives investigating after the crash[84] and later the officers who worked on Operation Paget rejected his evidence.[85] With the Mercedes behind him, he claimed to have seen the flash in his rear-view mirror and recounted other elements of what he saw while he was negotiating the difficult bend out of the tunnel.[86] Crucially, however, his testimony was directly contradicted by his then-wife, who was in the passenger seat next to him.[85] However, eyewitness Brian Anderson, an American tourist, told detectives that he too saw a bright flash.[87]

French Police in 1997 were aware of Levistre's conviction in Rouen during 1989 for dishonesty and his subsequent prison sentence,[84] and he was not thought by them to be a reliable witness.[88] Television documentaries produced by Channel 4 in 2004 and the BBC in 2006 both raised this issue;[88] he appeared as a witness at the British inquiry via a video link in October 2007. Diana: Secrets Behind the Crash (3 June 1998), an ITV programme presented by Nicholas Owen, then ITN's Royal Correspondent, gave enough weight to the claims of Levistre that 93% of viewers polled by the Mirror newspaper just after the broadcast believed there had been a bright flash of light at the time of the crash.[82]

The detail of eyewitness testimony was thoroughly reviewed and Operation Paget officers succeeded in uncovering two new witnesses. Other eyewitness testimony made little reference to the appearance of any inexplicable flashes at the crash site. Several witnesses who would be expected to have seen a blinding flash made no reference to one. In any event, the detailed crash reconstruction revealed that the chain of events that led to the car unavoidably colliding with the pillar started well before it was at the mouth of the tunnel where the flash is alleged to have occurred. Furthermore, a strobe light of the type that was alleged to have been used is so powerful that a flash emitted from it would have been bright enough to illuminate a very wide area. It would have likely blinded not only Paul, but also the driver of the white Fiat Uno, the pursuing paparazzi and witnesses standing at the road side. The Operation Paget report concluded that the alleged flash did not happen.[89]

There was some media discussion in April 2006 suggesting that Diana was a faithful seat belt user and therefore the fact that both her and Dodi's seat belts either failed or were not used was sinister and might suggest sabotage.[90] Her sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale later said that Diana ""was religious in putting on her seat belt"".[91] Other sources question if she did in fact use her seat belt all the time, as was suggested.[90]

""What is certain is that she was not wearing a seat belt and this made things worse. We would like to think that if she had been wearing a seat belt, we'd have been able to save her,"" said Prof. André Lienhart, who reviewed the emergency services' response for the French government investigation of the incident.[92] CNN did an analysis of the crash in early September 1997 and concluded that injuries would have been minor had the occupants been wearing seat belts. The conclusions were provisional owing to limited data about the specific Mercedes model as the limousine was not sold in the US.[93]

Analysis of the wreckage of the car after its repatriation to England in 2005 by a Forensic Accident Investigator from the Transport Research Laboratory of thirty-five years experience on behalf of Operation Paget found that all the seat belts were in good working order except for the right rear one which was attached to the seat Diana occupied. Follow up enquiries with French investigators found that they had declared all the seat belts operational at an examination in October 1998, suggesting the damage to this seat belt took place after the accident.[94]

The British inquest verdict explicitly stated that lack of seat belts had ""caused or contributed to"" the deaths of both Dodi and Diana.[95]

The first call to the emergency services' switchboard was logged at 12.26 a.m. The SAMU ambulance carrying the Princess arrived at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital at 2.06 a.m. This length of time has prompted much conspiracy-related comment.

The period between the crash and the arrival at the hospital takes into account the following: the time taken for emergency services to arrive; the time taken by the Sapeurs-Pompiers (fire service) of Paris to remove Diana from the damaged car; and the actual journey time from the crash site to the hospital. Police Officers Sébastien Dorzee and Lino Gagliadorne were the first emergency officials to arrive at the scene at around 12:30 a.m. Sergeants Xavier Gourmelom and Philippe Boyer of the Sapeurs-Pompiers arrived at around 12:32 a.m. Doctor Jean-Marc Martino, a specialist in anaesthetics and intensive care treatment and the doctor in charge of the SAMU ambulance, arrived at around 12:40 a.m. Diana was removed from the car at 1:00 a.m. She then went into cardiac arrest. Following external cardiopulmonary resuscitation, her heart started beating again. She was moved to the SAMU ambulance at 1:18 a.m.[96]

The ambulance departed the crash scene at 1:41 a.m. and arrived at the hospital at 2:06 a.m.—a journey time of approximately 26 minutes. This included a stop at the Gare d'Austerlitz ordered by Dr Martino because of the drop in the blood pressure of the Princess of Wales and the necessity to deal with it. The ambulance was travelling slowly on his express instructions. The doctor was concerned about Diana's blood pressure and the effects on her medical condition of deceleration and acceleration.

The SAMU ambulance carrying Diana passed the Hôtel-Dieu Hospital on the Ile de la Cité en route to the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. The decision to transfer her to the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital was taken by Dr Marc Lejay who was on despatch duty in SAMU Control on that night, in consultation with Dr Derossi, who was at the scene. The Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital was the main reception centre for multiple trauma patients in Paris. The Hôtel-Dieu was not equipped to deal with the injuries Diana had sustained. Lejay stated: ‘The Hôtel-Dieu hospital on the ‘Ile de la Cité’ is closer but not equipped with heart surgery teams or neurosurgical teams or teams trained to take patients with multiple injuries.’ Lejay was also aware that Professor Bruno Riou was on duty at the Pitié-Salpêtrière that night and was particularly skilled to treat her injuries. Dr Jean-Marc Martino supported this view.[97]

Mohamed Al-Fayed alleged that Diana's body was deliberately embalmed shortly after her death to ensure that any pregnancy test at the post-mortem would produce a false result.

Operation Paget found that 31 August 1997 was a very hot day in Paris. Diana's body had been stored in an empty room adjacent to the emergency room where she had been treated at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, as the mortuary was on the other side of the hospital grounds and some distance away. Dry ice and air conditioning units were placed in the room to keep it cool but appeared to have had little success.[98]

Diana's two sisters and Prince Charles were scheduled to view the body later that afternoon before bringing it back to the United Kingdom. President Jacques Chirac and his wife also wished to pay their respects. This meant there was very little time to prepare the body for viewing, and it was clearly unacceptable to present Diana's body to her family and the President of France in the state it was in. Faced with this situation, the hospital staff decided to press ahead with embalming with only verbal authority from Madame Martine Monteil, the local superintendent of police, who assured Jean Monceau ""that everything would be in order"". Under French law, paperwork must be completed before undertaking the embalming of any corpse likely to be subject to a post-mortem. This paperwork was completed, but only after the embalming had been carried out, giving rise to allegations of suspicious circumstances. The allegations were made despite there being no way the hospital staff could have known whether or not Diana was pregnant, as a pregnancy test would have been irrelevant to her post crash treatment and accordingly was not carried out.[99]

The Court Martial of SAS Sniper Danny Nightingale led to a letter written by witness, Soldier N, and sent to his in-laws coming to wider attention. Soldier N, Nightingale's former roommate, was in prison for illegally hiding firearms and ammunition. On 17 August 2013, the Metropolitan Police announced they were reviewing evidence that Soldier N had boasted that the SAS were behind the death of Princess Diana.[100] The parents of Soldier N's estranged wife reportedly wrote to the SAS's commanding officer, claiming Soldier N had told his wife the unit ""arranged"" Diana's death and it was ""covered up"".[101][102] The information was reportedly passed onto Scotland Yard by the Royal Military Police. However, Scotland Yard stressed that this information would not lead to a re-investigation and that they were examining its ""relevance and credibility"".[103] They also confirmed that Prince Charles and Mohamed Al-Fayed were being kept informed as preliminary examination progressed. At the end of November 2013, Scotland Yard ended its study of the SAS allegations and released a statement: ""The Metropolitan Police Service has scoped the information and is in the process of drawing up conclusions, which will be communicated to the families and interested parties first, before any further comment can be made,""[104] On 16 December, it emerged from Sky News reports that there was ""no credible evidence"" that the SAS was involved in the death of the Princess and the others, and thus no reason to re-open the investigation.[105][106]

The Murder of Princess Diana is a bestselling 2004 book by British journalist Noel Botham which disputes the official version of events and suggests an orchestrated conspiracy. A fictionalised telemovie adaption, The Murder of Princess Diana was later released. [107]

Unlawful Killing, a British documentary film about the deaths of Diana and Dodi, was shown May 2011 in Cannes, while the 2011 Cannes Film Festival was in progress. It was directed by Keith Allen and funded by Mohamed Al-Fayed. The film was not shown in British cinemas; lawyers for the producers suggested that 87 cuts needed to be made before it could be certified for release.[108] Following its failure to gain insurance against possible legal action, following putative distribution in the United States, the film was shelved in 2012.[109]",mainstream
1134,"The once-invincible, arrogant, egotistical, fat-cat, lavishly paid CEOs are now afraid of losing their jobs. The departure of CEOs—whether by choice, pressure or unceremoniously thrown out the door—set a record this year. About 1,160 U.S. corporations announced that their respective CEOs were leaving, setting an all time record, according to executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

The reasons for the separations run the gamut, including repercussions from scandals, poor financial performance, getting out while on top, retirement or the corporation’s need for a change in leadership. The press releases surrounding the departures are usually sanitized to protect both the departing CEO and the company’s brand image. You need to do some homework and digging to find the real reasons.

Just this week, three CEOs of top U.S. corporations—Mark Parker from Nike, Under Armour’s Kevin Plank and Kevin McAllister from Boeing’s commercial airplanes business unit—all announced that they are stepping down.

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management, claims that “CEOs are now being held on a shorter leash.” He added, “When the puffery and the rhetoric doesn’t match reality, the boards are under pressure to hold the CEOs accountable. People want to leave on a high,” said Sonnenfeld. “They want to get out when the going's good.”

There are other factors as well. Baby Boomer CEOs are getting older and are readying for retirement. They often make the transition to a less stressful chairmanship title, as opposed to running a company. There has been a rise in activist shareholders (such as hedge funds), private equity firms on the lookout to buy out companies, enhanced media scrutiny of CEOs and backlashes that develop on social media sites. There is a sentiment that after a long bull run in the stock market and robust economy, some CEOs may elect to leave while on top and cash out their large stock holdings.

Nike, the sneaker giant, announced that its CEO, Mark Parker, will step down after 13 years of leading the global footwear company. Parker, 64, has been with Nike for over 40 years, since 1979. He quickly rose up the ranks and was appointed CEO in 2006. John Donahoe, a Nike board member and CEO of cloud-computing company ServiceNow, will take over. Parker will become executive chairman of the board after he steps down. Two years ago, Nike had stated that Parker would remain CEO ""beyond 2020.""

Parker has overseen some scandals over the last few years. After Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey’s Hong Kong tweet, it was uncovered that Nike virtually runs the NBA through its prolific advertising and sponsorships and has allowed China to dictate terms to the league. Separately, there were lawsuits filed against the company over alleged gender discrimination, poor treatment of pregnant professional athletes and a ""boys-club"" culture at Nike. Fairly recently, the company shut down a division as the Nike Oregon Project coach Alberto Salazar, was banned from sports for four years for accusations of doping violations.

Parker dismissed speculation that he was pushed out. In a note to employees, Parker wrote, ""To be clear, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not sick. There are no issues I'm not sharing. I strongly believe the best way for us to evolve and grow as a company is to bring in a phenomenal talent to join our team who has long been part of the Nike family."" On Tuesday, in an interview with CNBC, Parker asserted that the change in leadership has ""absolutely nothing to do with"" the Salazar situation.

Kevin Plank, CEO and founder of Under Armour, also announced his retirement this week. Plank founded the sportswear company in his grandmother's basement while still in college and has run it ever since. He will transition to the role of executive chairman as president and COO Patrik Frisk takes over as CEO.

Shareholders have applauded the change. Plank owns 33.8 million shares of Under Armour stock—14.79% of the company. After the announcement, the stock price jumped and so did Plank’s net worth, as he gained an additional $89 million dollars. Plank owns a huge chunk of stock in his company amounting to about $710 million.

The last couple of years were rough for Plank and Under Armour. The company had excess inventory, which required a costly restructuring that led to a loss of $200 million. Due to a shift in consumer demands, the gravitation toward athleisure wear products (such as Lululemon), the company was forced to layoff 400 employees to cut costs.

The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Plank and other corporate executives ran a frat-house type of environment. It was said that athletes and employees were regularly taken to strip clubs, as paid for by the company. The WSJ also raised questions about the relationship between Plank and MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle, both of whom are married. The corporation is also in a heated battle with two strong competitors, Nike and Adidas.

This week, Kevin McAllister announced that he’s stepping down from Boeing as the CEO of its commercial airplanes division. Public backlash over the crashes and deaths of passengers flying on the company’s new 737 Max planes. Airlines in many countries grounded the Boeing 737 MAX passenger airliners after two MAX 8 aircraft crashed, killing all 346 people aboard. Unofficially, the cause is attributed to the airplane's new automated flight control. The pilots didn’t truly understand how to operate it.

McAllister joined Boeing shortly before the Max’s debut, but is paying the price as the first scapegoat. On Monday, consumer advocate Ralph Nader called for the removal of The Boeing Company’s CEO Dennis Muilenburg and the entire Boeing board of directors. Muilenburg was previously stripped of his chairman title.

Recently, I wrote about a number of other CEOs who are no longer holding this exalted title. WeWork’s former CEO, Adam Neumann, was shown the door after the board of directors and investors grew tired of his alleged financial self-dealings and controversial tactics for running the company. Neumann’s exit is reminiscent of Uber’s CEO Travis Kalanick’s, who was also driven out of the company in the wake of allegations over incidents of harassment, retaliation, discrimination and bullying—including his own video taped rant at an Uber driver.

Overstock.com’s CEO, Patrick Byrne, recently resigned due to the controversy surrounding his involvement in an FBI Russian espionage investigation and personal relationship with a convicted Russian agent, Maria Butina. Kevin Burns, the CEO of Juul, resigned after media reports about the health hazards experienced by younger smokers of his e-cigarette product. Carlos Ghosn, the epitome of old-school, global, corporate elite, was kicked out of his company, Nissan Motor, and arrested after an alleged scheme was revealed that he tried to conceal more than $90 million of his compensation from investors and public disclosure. John H. Schnatter, better known as “Papa John,” founded the eponymous pizza chain and later stepped down as CEO after comments he made criticizing NFL commissioner Roger Goodell for allegedly not doing anything about the national anthem protests by football players. He then resigned as chairman of the board on July 11, 2018, when a scandal broke out over his use of a racial slur when trying to minimize the controversy over his NFL national anthem comments. Leslie Moonves was one of the most powerful and highest-paid media CEOs, serving as the chairman and CEO of CBS. Moonves was accused by a number of women of sexual misconduct and left the company.

The era of the untouchable and unaccountable CEO seems like it's coming to an end.",mainstream
657,"It takes a really frustrating election run-up that leads people to speculate whether a nomination, or even the entire election, could hinge on how a candidate deals with a flatbread with tomato, cheese and other toppings, aka a pizza Calling it Pizzagate may imbue the Republican nomination hopeful John Kasich’s culinary infraction with a layer of seriousness, but hauling him over the coals for eating a hot pizza with a fork is harsh.Especially since his arch-rival Donald Trump has committed the same faux pas with characteristic nonchalance.In any case, upon learning from recently revealed campaign statistics that their former Senator and current front-runner for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton has been forking out large amounts of dough to order those classic pies for her hungry team, New Yorkers may hand the state’s delegates to her as a reward.Maybe all true-blue New Yorkers are justified in getting outraged by any disregard for this revered cultural practice and the incident deserves to be put on par with the serious gaffes westerners usually make in the tradition-bound regions of the world.But liberal and hip residents of the Big Apple really should not take it to heart if anyone — including White House hopefuls — eat pizza with anything other than hands.

660,"I am republishing this post from July 27, 2010 in view of Pizzagate, which gives this post a new significance.

 When you read this post, just remember that a pedophile is defined as an adult with “sexual fondness for and activity” with children, i.e., minors below the age of consent. In other words, the definition doesn’t require that there be sexual abuse of a child; sexual attraction to children is definitive. That in turn means that the Pentagon employees busted for child porn are pedophiles.

 

 Remember the news back in April 2010 that, while the economy crashed, senior staffers at the federal government’s Securities and Exchange Commission were spending hours surfing pornographic websites on government-issued computers while they were being paid to police the financial system?

 Now comes news that employees and contractors of the Pentagon are buying and watching child porn on the taxpayers’ dime. Not only is porn-watching on government computers illegal, it is against the law for all Americans to purchase and view child pornography. Worse still, some of the Pentagon child porn creeps have high-level security clearances, which makes them national security hazards because their sexual perversion makes them vulnerable to blackmail.

 On July 23, 2010, Dana Hedgpeth of the Washington Post reports that “Federal investigators have identified about 20 Pentagon employees and contractors accused of buying and downloading online child pornography and in some cases used their government-issued computers to view the illegal material.”

 According to a 94-page report released by the Defense Department’s inspector general’s office, some of those involved possessed top-secret security clearances and worked for such divisions as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Reconnaissance Office. Those agencies deal with some of the government’s most sensitive intelligence and defense work.

 The number of Pentagon employees investigated was not disclosed in the report, but a Pentagon spokeswoman said the probe involved about 20 people who had an “affiliation with the Defense Department” as full-time employees, former military members or contractors. Some of those people have been prosecuted, and some of their cases were dropped for lack of evidence. Other cases remain open.

 The cases are part of a wider probe, Operation Flicker, which was started by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement four years ago and which has identified more than 5,000 people who subscribed to online child pornography websites.

 The cases detailed in the new report include one involving an employee of Oracle Corp. who had a top-secret clearance and worked on a contract for the National Security Agency. The man subscribed to various child pornography websites and made 21 purchases. After authorities started investigating him, the report said, he attempted to tamper with computers at his office. He was put on administrative leave with pay. He later fled to Libya but was arrested and extradited to the United States.

 Another case involved a government employee at the National Defense University in Norfolk who made two purchases from a child pornography website. He pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and was sentenced to five years in prison.

 It is illegal to access pornography with a government computer.

Five years later, the Boston Globe discovered the Pentagon still had not investigated as many as 1,700 of the cases involving employees suspected of child-porn.

296,"WASHINGTON — John Podesta has given it a lot of thought and believes the best way to deal with the trolls is to ignore them. His wife, Mary, however, takes a different approach. When angry people call their home in the middle of the night, she has a conversation with them.

“She sits on the phone and talks to them, which is disconcerting actually to most of the people who are calling just to leave a nasty message on your voicemail,” Podesta says. “When somebody actually engages them and says, ‘Why are you doing this?’ they fold pretty quickly. But she has more patience for that than I do.”

Podesta is easily forgiven for having little time for his tormentors. Since 2016, he has been the victim of a deranged and viral conspiracy theory known as Pizzagate. The theory — which has its roots in the emails stolen from his personal account by Russian hackers and dumped online by WikiLeaks — claimed that Podesta was a pedophile and that he, Hillary Clinton and a Washington, D.C., restaurateur named James Alefantis ran a child sex-trafficking ring from the basement of Alefantis’ pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong.

On its face, Pizzagate was insane, with zero basis in reality. Yet in the frenzied days after Donald Trump’s election, it caught fire on social media platforms including Twitter, YouTube, Reddit and 4Chan, metastasizing into a story so twisted and bizarre that it radicalized online trolls and traumatized others who, through no fault of their own, had gotten sucked into the conspiracy.

Two years ago this month, Pizzagate reached its grim apex when a 28-year-old man stormed into Comet Ping Pong with a revolver and an AR-15 on a mission to save the “children.” Edgar Maddison Welch had binge-watched YouTube videos about Pizzagate and tried to recruit friends for his rescue mission. “Raiding a pedo ring, possibly sacraficing [sic] the lives of a few for the lives of many,” he texted one friend a few days before he got in his Prius and drove from his home in North Carolina to Washington. Customers and employees fled the restaurant as Welch fired several rounds into a locked closet full of computer gear, searching for the infamous child sex dungeon in Comet’s basement, which he never found — not least because the pizzeria doesn’t even have a basement. No one was hurt, and Welch surrendered to the police, hands on his head, in broad daylight in the street outside of Comet. He was later sentenced to four years in federal prison.

Even after the arrest, Pizzagate lived on. The day after Welch stalked into Comet, Michael Flynn, Jr., the son of Trump’s first national security adviser, tweeted: “Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it’ll remain a story.” An Economist/YouGov poll in late December 2016 found that 46 percent of Trump voters and 17 percent of Clinton voters thought Pizzagate was real. A few months later, a small rally of Pizzagate believers took place outside the White House. Protesters have stood outside Comet carrying blown-up photos of Alefantis’ god-daughter taken from his social media accounts. Strangers online have threatened to torture, rape and kill him.

“I’ve been through a lot of Washington shit in my life,” Alefantis tells Rolling Stone. He grew up in D.C., and dated David Brock, the notorious conservative journalist turned Clinton loyalist, for 10 years. “This is not my first time at the rodeo,” he says. “I had never seen this volume of specific, directed attacks.”

In the two years since the shooting, our understanding of online conspiracy theories has grown, of how they take root and the people who believe and spread those theories. But what about the victims? What is it like to be on the receiving end? How do you fight back against a plainly false allegation that changes your life?

For four decades John Podesta has worked at the highest levels of American politics: campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton’s historic 2016 presidential run, chief of staff to President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, counselor to President Obama and adviser to senators and congressmen. But nothing could prepare him for Pizzagate.

Speaking about the conspiracy theory and its impact on his life for the first time, Podesta tells Rolling Stone that he learned about it the old-fashioned way: from the news. As Clinton campaign chair, he had spent the final month of the 2016 race locked in hand-to-hand combat with reporters about the contents of his personal emails, which WikiLeaks was releasing in periodic batches to damage Clinton’s chances. He didn’t have time to reflect on the hack, let alone notice the conspiracy theories bubbling up about him on websites like Reddit and 4Chan.

Searching for evidence of illegality or anything sinister in Podesta’s hacked emails, wannabe online sleuths decided that mentions of “pizza” were code for child pornography. An anonymous 4chan user posted a list of other supposed code words to search for in Podesta’s emails — “pasta” meant little boy, “ice cream” meant male prostitute, “sauce” meant orgy. Soon, the hashtag #Pizzagate appeared and spread like wildfire on social media.

Podesta claims he wasn’t overly concerned about his emails getting released: their contents, he now says, were “relatively much ado about nothing.” It wasn’t until after the election that he realized those emails had become fuel for a horrific conspiracy theory. In his career, he says he had never been on the receiving end of something like Pizzagate. “It’s painful and crazy,” he says. “I’m pretty grizzled. One big difference is you’ve got somebody sitting in the Oval Office stoking the conspiracy. That’s pretty different than what I’ve experienced in my years in politics.”

Podesta was only one strain of the conspiracy. Another thread formed around Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong. It appears to have begun with a 2008 email included in the WikiLeaks dump in which Alefantis asked Podesta if he would give a speech at an Obama fundraiser at Comet. From there, the trolls began mining every detail they could find about Alefantis and Comet, quickly concocting a parallel theory that said Alefantis, Podesta and Clinton ran a child sex-trafficking ring. Self-styled investigators claimed that symbols on Comet’s iconic sign (which had previously been used by a D.C. liquor store that had since closed) were linked to satanic rituals. They said a photo of an empty walk-in refrigerator was evidence of a secret kill room.

One day in November 2016, roughly a month before Welch’s attack, one of Alefantis’ young employees told him that a wild theory called Pizzagate was blowing up on Reddit. “What’s Reddit?” he asked.

Alefantis is a self-taught chef who never graduated from college and a self-made restaurateur well-known around Washington. (GQ named him one of D.C.’s 50 most powerful people in 2012.) He opened Comet more than a decade ago to be “a place of play and interaction,” as he puts it, where families could eat pizza and play ping pong and engage in real, substantive conversations with one another.

Alefantis told his staff that this Pizzagate thing would blow over after the election. Then Trump won, and the threats got worse. Violent messages poured into Comet’s Instagram and Facebook accounts, some of which Alefantis shared with Rolling Stone:

I truly hope someone blows your brains all over comet pizza

Are you scared yet? You should be motherfucker because were [sic] coming for you

You need to be raped killed and tortured like you do to children u sick fuck .. ur days of freedom are numbers u evil douche

The home addresses and phone numbers of Alefantis and his employees were published online. Comet would receive 150 menacing calls in a single day, Alefantis says, so he unplugged the phone. People reviewed Comet on Yelp and said there were chopped-up baby parts in their food.

As the threats became more violent, Alefantis repeatedly contacted the D.C. police and the FBI. He estimates he called the bureau three or four times and described a situation that, he admits, sounded insane. The FBI largely told him to call the police. “They were essentially like, ‘If you get a specific threat, let us know. Thank you, goodbye.'” When he asked what qualified as a specific threat, the FBI said, “A date and time when they’re going to come.” He says the local police visited Comet on multiple occasions but there was zero specific action taken by the police or the FBI as the threats escalated in the weeks after the election. (The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.)

At the same time the Pizzagaters barraged Comet, they attacked Alefantis personally. Strangers filmed his house and questioned his neighbors, he says. Any person or organization connected to him also got sucked in. A non-profit art gallery whose board he chaired received angry calls. Any trace of Alefantis’ life found in public records or social media — an old home address, an event he had attended — was used against him.

He came to see Pizzagate as a real-life video game played by the theory’s true believers. “These are people at home who want to investigate, and basically anything that’s available online is fair game to them,” Alefantis says. Sometimes, when he responded to the people making the threats, they would veer off into unexpected territory. “Some of those messages to me were, ‘How much do you pay your employees? Do you have health care?'” When he told them he did in fact offer health care, some responded, “Will you hire me?”

But the onslaught proved too much for him to handle on his own. Through a friend, he got in touch with Mike Gottlieb, a partner at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner. (David Boies, one of the firm’s founders, is the renowned litigator who has faced criticism for his work on behalf of Harvey Weinstein and the fraudulent blood-testing company Theranos.) Alefantis and Gottlieb met on a Friday in early December 2016, and Gottlieb agreed to take on Alefantis as a client. That Sunday, Welch walked into the restaurant, guns in tow. (Welch did not respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment.)

Alefantis wasn’t at Comet but rushed over when he heard about the gunman. The neighborhood was a crime scene: there were SWAT officers and yellow tape everywhere, and police had evacuated Comet’s employees to a fire station down the street. The workers at Buck’s Fishing and Camping, another restaurant Alefantis owned on the same block as Comet, were locked inside for their safety, as were the other people who worked at nearby businesses. “I really hope that all these people fanning the flames of this conspiracy theory would take a moment to contemplate what has gone on today and maybe to stop,” Alefantis, still in shock, told reporters later that day.

At the urging of his new legal and P.R. team, Alefantis reopened Comet on Dec. 6th, two days after the attack. A long line of customers waited to get in, and he stood at the front door to personally welcome them. He recalls seeing one of his best friends from high school in line with her young kids. Months later, Alefantis and the friend talked about that day. “She said, ‘The look on your face was Don’t come here,'” he recalls. “I asked her, ‘How did you feel?’ She was like, ‘I did not want to go there. It was so terrifying for me.'” But her kids wanted to go and so she took them. “That trauma exists,” he says, “not just for me, but for a whole community of people.”

After Comet was back up and running, Alefantis and his lawyers set out to stop the spread of Pizzagate. “For me, at some point, I was like: My name is totally destroyed,” Alefantis says. “I just didn’t want anyone to come shoot us up again.”

The response from the social media companies ranged from helpful to utterly dismissive, Alefantis recalls. Even before he’d hired lawyers, Alefantis had gotten Yelp to suspend Comet’s page after his staff had reported the abusive reviews. Facebook was responsive to Comet’s complaints. YouTube, however, refused to so much as acknowledge its role in amplifying Pizzagate, saying they were just a platform, that they weren’t an arbiter of truth and falsity and told Alefantis to get back in touch if and when he could get a court order finding the videos that promoted Pizzagate to be defamatory.

“YouTube is a platform committed to allowing a wide range of free expression, but it is not and never has been anything goes,” a YouTube spokesperson tells Rolling Stone, adding that in the first half of 2018 the company removed more than 17 million individual videos that violated its policies.

The traditional crisis communications playbook proved useless. Media interviews and op-eds did nothing to quiet the conspiracists and, if anything, emboldened them. Alefantis’ lawyers and P.R. team booked him onto then-Fox News host Megyn Kelly’s show a few weeks after the attack. It didn’t help: Alefantis answered all of Kelly’s questions, but the interview just became more fodder. “We thought it was possible to show and tell the facts — to make sure that people could see with their own eyes that the crazy conspiracies were just false,” says Molly Levinson, a communications strategist who advised Alefantis. “But we quickly learned that in these kinds of situations any attention is bad attention, any public conversation becomes twisted and contorted and most likely has more of a negative than positive effect.”

The only real strategy, Alefantis realized, was a legal strategy. He would have to get aggressive with the loudest proponents of Pizzagate, people like Alex Jones, host of InfoWars, who had run multiple broadcasts with titles like “Pizzagate Is Real” and “Pizzagate: The Bigger Picture.”

Gradually, in the months after the gunman showed up, Jones and others seemed to bow to legal pressure and backed away from Pizzagate. On March 24th, 2017, Jones published online and read on-air a lengthy statement in which he apologized to Alefantis, announced that he had removed past broadcasts about Pizzagate and admitted that those stories were based on “an incorrect narrative.” Neither Alefantis nor his lawyers would further comment on any interactions with Jones or on any possible settlement.

Podesta says he considered litigation as well. But suing the Pizzagaters would be extremely difficult given that he was a major public figure. He pushed back against the trolls on Twitter, but that didn’t make much difference, either. He found that the best course of action was doing nothing. “If I really spent my life trying to figure out what those people were saying, it would drive me nuts,” he says. “The only rational reaction to that is to deal with it when there’s something serious and right in front of you, but for the most part to try to ignore it.”

This past September, Alefantis traveled to New York City to attend a therapy session with his ex-boyfriend. Alefantis and his ex had broken up as Pizzagate was raging, but they had decided to see a therapist together. During their session, Alefantis assured his ex that, almost two years later, the nightmare had passed. “Things have moved on,” he recalls saying. “You’re safe. Everyone’s fine. It’s all over.”

After their session, they headed for the subway. A stranger approached Alefantis on the street and began taking pictures in his face and screaming at him.

“I’m going to my kid’s school right now!” the stranger said, apparently fearing for his child’s safety.

“Don’t engage, James,” his ex told him.

“Go call the police,” Alefantis said to the man, “and get the fuck away from me.”

Alefantis walked his ex to the subway station. The stranger followed Alefantis on foot before eventually leaving. “The guy’s basically chasing after me through the streets of New York,” he recalls. “He’s a Pizzagater. He recognized me. It still happens.”

Today, Alefantis says business at Comet is back to pre-Pizzagate levels. The angry phone calls and violent online threats have mostly subsided. You can still find plenty of disturbing tweets if you search for #Pizzagate or #CometPingPong on social media. But the worst of it appears to be over. Alefantis says he thinks the trolls just moved on to other things.

A restaurant in a smaller city, owned by someone with fewer connections, would’ve closed, he says. But the community of customers Alefantis had built up over the years rallied around him. Three brief phone calls and he had a meeting with one of the best attorneys in the country. “If this had been someone else or someone else’s restaurant, without 10 years of hard work and support behind us, without my understanding of how absurd the world can be and how difficult these things are, other people would have been taken down,” he says.

But the trauma remains. He’s been called the most despicable thing you can say to someone. Even in liberal circles, people jokingly refer to him as the Pizzagate guy. He’s figuring out what the ordeal means for his future. “Previous to this, I was out in the world and I had nothing but glowing Google hits and my restaurants were easily reviewed,” he says. “Now, it’s nothing but filth, basically. When I go into a business meeting or do a new venture or go into a new relationship with someone serious, there are major issues. It’s destroyed my name.”

Podesta, for his part, says Pizzagate seems to be largely over for him, to the extent online conspiracy theories ever really go away. He says his neighbors have chased away people walking up and down his block and acting suspiciously. After a Trump supporter sent pipe bombs to a number of prominent Democrats in October, Podesta resorted to poking and prodding his mail with a pen before opening it. President Trump still tweets about him, his messages amplified by an army of trolls at the ready. And the same backlash happens any time Podesta himself tweets about Trump, a move his staff has come to dread but something he won’t give up.

Pizzagate has left him with some pretty big scars, Podesta says, but he worries more about the victims of viral conspiracy theories who don’t have his thick skin. “As a person who’s pretty hardened by a lifetime in politics, I sometimes think, ‘Well, how would a normal person even begin to live with this?'”

Still, Podesta admits that the events of the past two years have left him less inclined to speak out. “You’re conscious about the notion that you are going to trigger a crazy response,” he says. “Sometimes you feel compelled to do it anyway. And I don’t do it for fun. I do it when I think something’s serious enough that I need to say something. And now I’m just a little bit more guarded it, and guarded about what appearances I accept.”

He catches himself from sounding too woe-is-me. “I’ve had the honor of working for a president,” he says. “I can’t bitch too much about my life. It’s been pretty good.”",mainstream
197,"Sarah Palin has apologised to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, whom she previously said should be hunted down as a terrorist.

The former Vice Presidential nominee previously accused Assange of being an 'anti-American operative with blood on his hands' over Wikileaks' publication classified documents relating to the war in Afghanistan.

She condemned Assange in 2010 shortly after the website released a cache of her own emails.

She said the Wikileaks founder should be ""pursued with the same urgency we pursue al Qaeda and Taliban leaders.""

But in a post on her Facebook page published last night, she showered Assange with praise for releasing the emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton 's campaign director.

US intelligence services believe Podesta's correspondence was stolen by hackers acting on the instruction of the Russian government, in a deliberate bid to interfere with the US election.

President Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the US in response to the allegations.

But last night, in an interview with Fox News, Assange told Trump-supporting news anchor Sean Hannity the Russian government were not his source for the emails.

Palin has spoken favourably about Russian president Vladimir Putin in the past, saying ""You have to hand it to the man. Nobody has to guess what side he is on.""

Last night, she told Facebook followers: ""Exposing the truth re: the Left having been oh-so-guilty of atrocious actions and attitudes of which they've falsely accused others.

""The media collusion that hid what many on the Left have been supporting is shocking.""

She did not elaborate on what specifically was 'shocking' about what 'many on the Left have been supporting.'

The emails highlighted details of paid speeches made by Hillary Clinton to Wall Street figures that staffers believed could have been problematic to her campaign.

They also appeared to reveal CNN anchor Donna Brazile had shared a question from the second Presidential TV debate with the clinton campaign ahead of time, which Brazile repeatedly denied.

Conspiracy theorists seized upon discussions of a Washington DC Pizza restaurant - Comet Ping Pong, a regular haunt of DC insiders - which they falsely claimed was evidence Clinton staffers were speaking in code and were involved in a child sex abuse ring based in the restaurant's basement.

The bizarre theory - which became known as 'pizza-gate' - climaxed when a man turned up to Comet Ping Pong with an automatic rifle, saying he was 'self-investigating' the conspiracy.

Edgar Maddison Welch stormed into the restaurant with an AR-15 rifle, terrorising customers, shooting into the floor and demanding to see the basement.

He eventually surrendered to police after being informed the restaurant had no basement.

Palin added: ""This important information that finally opened people's eyes to Democrat candidates and operatives would not have been exposed were it not for Julian Assange.

""I apologize for condemning Assange when he published my infamous (and proven noncontroversial, relatively boring) emails years ago.

""As I said at the time of being targeted and my subsequent condemnation, though, the line must be drawn before our troops or innocent lives deserving protection would be put at risk as a result of published emails.""

In a 2010 Facebook post, Palin wrote: ""Assange is not a ‘journalist,’ any more than the “editor” of al Qaeda’s new English-language magazine Inspire is a ‘journalist.’

“He is an anti-American operative with blood on his hands.

“His past posting of classified documents revealed the identity of more than 100 Afghan sources to the Taliban.

“Why was he not pursued with the same urgency we pursue al Qaeda and Taliban leaders?""

""What if any diplomatic pressure was brought to bear on NATO, EU, and other allies to disrupt Wikileaks’ technical infrastructure?

“Did we use all the cyber tools at our disposal to permanently dismantle Wikileaks? Were individuals working for Wikileaks on these document leaks investigated? “Shouldn’t they at least have had their financial assets frozen just as we do to individuals who provide material support for terrorist organizations?""",mainstream

90,"“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” - Arthur C. Clarke

Jenna Abrams is not a real person. Her Twitter feed had 70,000 followers. She inspired support from fans and angry responses from opponents. Her mostly inane, but occasionally racist blog posts were widely read and reposted, with enthusiastic comments. At one point, she managed to get a fake story picked up by mainstream news media. Her Twitter handle was on a list of accounts connected with Russian intelligence, turned over by the company to Congressional investigators.

We know what Jenna Abrams was not. She was not a living, breathing, carbon-based entity. What she was remains unclear. Was she a bot? An AI project? Was her account supported by an individual or a team? Should Abrams be described as a “she” or a “they” or an “it”? Abrams maintained a Gmail account and a blog. She replied to tweets and emails. After her Twitter account was suspended, she posted an enigmatic anti-confession on her blog, a mind-pretzel acknowledging the claims about her identity without either a formal denial or an admission.

Stories about Abrams and other accounts disclosed by Twitter and Facebook have focused on Russian meddling in our democracy. Behind that tale of espionage lies a more disturbing theme, one that will continue to trouble us after Russian political intrigue fades. We have long assumed that reality is universal and accessible to everyone. Future generations will not take reality for granted. Technology we created has defeated an evolutionary advantage we enjoyed for hundreds of thousands of years. Our brains are no longer the world’s finest computation engine.

Liberal democracy is built on assumptions developed and refined by Enlightenment Era philosophers. They concluded that reality is objective and measurable – singular and discoverable rather than varied and relational. Reality exists independent of our relationship to it or our acceptance of it. The Age of Reason was a rejection of superstition, prejudice and unquestioned tradition. By Enlightenment logic, any individual can judge reality on their own, without paternalistic intermediaries like priests or aristocrats, merely by educating themselves and learning to doubt, question and test. On the foundations of that empiricist ideal has risen a global political and economic system, dedicated to the proposition that individuals are the best judge not only of their own interests, but of the optimal direction of a civilization.

In a world governed by evolutionary dynamics, no successful innovation remains successful indefinitely. Progress bred of Enlightenment insights changed the world in ways that now challenge the relevance of those same insights. The Enlightenment is over. We don’t yet know what comes next.

This notion of an empirical, discoverable reality may still be true, but our ability to define it beyond a narrow, personal sphere is slipping away. Our first hints of trouble emerged a century ago, as discoveries in particle physics challenged our confidence in empiricism as the only basis of reality. However, what kicked the stool out from under the Enlightenment ideal was the explosion of artificial computational power over the past half-century.

Computer chips in your kitchen appliances carry more calculating power than NASA could generate in its entire array of Apollo-era mainframes. It is difficult to place a relatable context around the exponential growth of cheap, artificial computing power in our lifetimes.

We’ve grown used to a world in which our tools outperform us at most manual tasks, but cannot match us at uniquely “human” activities. That cognitive advantage is now slipping away. There are no games remaining in which a human can reliably defeat a computer. Machine learning algorithms now comb through wire reports and press releases to compose news stories for major publications. Hundreds of news reports have been produced by Heliograf, the Washington Post’s automated story-writer. Computers can compose communications that we would not recognize as artificial.

When all else fails, we tend to trust what we observe through our senses, but our computing platforms can manufacture highly realistic sensory experiences. Programmers at the University of Washington recently demonstrated an AI engine that can simulate convincing video content, dubbing a recorded statement with artificial messages. A Game of Thrones fan trained an AI engine to write the next book in the series. The output is posted here, a clumsy, though fascinating effort. More important than the quality of the robot book is the relatively minimal effort involved in producing it. It was made by a student in a Udacity (free online learning) course, using free, readily available software – the digital equivalent of kitchen chemistry.

When artificial cognitive capacity is paired with traditional robotic capabilities, the results are astonishing. Within a few years, computers will likely render human drivers too clumsy and dangerous to be trusted on the road. Truck drivers may continue to exist, but in a few years they will likely operate dozens of trucks at a time from remote control rooms. How long that oversight function will persist is hard to guess. Digital intelligence is rapidly nudging human intelligence out of its evolutionary path.

With growing computational power has come an explosion of raw data. For 244 years, the Encyclopedia Britannica maintained a printed record of human knowledge. In 2012, they finally gave up. Sometime in the 1990’s you might have read that half of all information that ever existed had been generated since 1976, or some similar factoid. With each year that passed, that data creation mid-point kept shrinking. A few years ago, you could read that 90% of all data had been created since 2010. It’s a statistic that has lost any relevance, as data growth begins to look like a singularity. By now, half of all data that ever existed on Earth has probably been generated since breakfast. No human being can even pretend to keep pace with this expansion of data. Information is now generated predominately by machines, for consumption and use by machines. Our ability to derive any value from this information depends on our capacity to interact with those machines.

Jenna Abrams is not a real person, but with thousands of followers she influenced the behavior of a great many real people, both followers and opponents. In the 2016 election, AI was a weapon leveraged by Russian intelligence against us, but our computational disadvantage persists with or without an enemy to exploit it. Cheap bots or machine learning code can be turned loose “in the wild” to create content largely without intent, creating a kind of information pollution. Microsoft experienced this nightmare last year when it debuted its adorable AI-driven social media bot, Tay. Crafted to adopt a cutesy twee pop persona and described as a bot “with no chill,” within hours of launch Tay had tweeted threats against feminists along with a series of racist posts. At one point, the engine responded to a message from a follower with this gem: “bush did 9/11 and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have now. donald trump is the only hope we’ve got.”

Microsoft scrambled to delete some of Tay’s most threatening and offensive Tweets, but its human handlers couldn’t keep up. Only by shutting off the machine could they rein in their monster. Human beings craft this technology, but the intentions of its creators rapidly disappear over the horizon behind it.

Similar code is available for free. With minimal computing skills it can be harnessed into communications engines and turned loose without supervision. This kind of cheap data pollution appears to have been part of the exhaust of the Russian campaign against us in 2016, but it needn’t be accompanied by any human intent to cloud our environment. Like an abandoned waste dump, these engines of misinformation can spread confusion unattended with few limits. Bots don’t get hungry. Bots don’t sleep. Bots don’t die.

In this new data environment, shrouded in a fog of highly convincing misinformation, what happens to old-fashioned, handmade, artisanal democracy? In the age of Trump, the answer is all around us. We’ve grown used to our dependence on experts for our very survival. No one tries to perform their own cancer surgery. Few people even work on their own car anymore. But we still hold as a central tenet of our political system the notion that each of us, independently, is supposed to be able to judge reality on our own, and use it to form policy preferences. That notion is now laughably false.

An unprecedented divide opened in the 2016 election cycle between college educated and non-college educated white voters. Polite explanations usually center around a “disconnect” between more and less affluent white voters, or concerns about racial bigotry. Ask people to explain their vote for Donald Trump and an additional explanation begins to emerge. Listen to enough of these voters and you’ll hear their position supported by entirely false narratives.

Lies, spin and tribal alignments are not new to politics, but we are facing something unique – the emergence of closed, synthetic worlds. Fed by the dislocating impact of a digital existence and the complexity that accompanies it, a universe of manufactured narratives has overwhelmed our sense of a common identity and a common fate. Our system presumes that reality is accessible to everyone, a kind of free-good on which all political engagement can be premised. If on the other hand, reality is elusive, it becomes the domain of experts. Those with high levels of education and a habit of relying on expert knowledge retain a reliable handle on objective reality. That hold is more tenuous than those elites wish to acknowledge, but it remains stronger than the image of reality derived from relatively closed systems. Crazy conspiracy theories and paranoid narratives spread more slowly among the affluent and college educated than among aging or working class voters in small towns.

In 2016, the structure and content of some of those closed worlds was influenced by intentional interference from Russian intelligence. However, their efforts merely weaponized an existing weakness in our political system. A disturbing volume of the misinformation in our political system is organic. Bizarre theories, like the Pizzagate conspiracy, take hold in a data echo chamber. They are amplified by social media bots with the help of people intentionally spreading deceit.

A reader might be tempted to a dangerous conceit. One might see this crisis of reality as a challenge to the rubes, a matter to be resolved perhaps with more investment in public education, or even by moves to narrow our reliance of democracy. This would be a dangerous misunderstanding, one we seem increasingly likely to make. While it’s true that less-educated voters were marginally more susceptible to the disinformation that wrecked the 2016 election process, they are not alone. They are merely a leading indicator of an advancing problem, the first domino to fall. We are drifting into an environment in which reality becomes so difficult to discern that people lack the energy or will to pursue it.

Jenna Abrams is not a real person. Laugh if you will at those duped by the performance, but a technological environment is taking shape in which human intellects will be hopelessly outclassed by the power of our tools. No one is smart enough to beat a machine at chess. To imagine that we will be able to tell the difference between a human and an AI on Twitter is hubris.

There is no obvious response, no simple policy prescription to carry us beyond the challenges of a digital, artificial reality. Our entire philosophy of representative government is challenged by this reality and we have no ready, viable alternative. That may sound unsettling, but merely coming to terms with the scope and character of this new environment is a challenge that will take time. Unfortunately, time is one of the resources rendered scarce in this new realm. While our bodies adapt on a biological time scale, our technologies adapt with the speed of automation. A more humble assessment of our capacity for defining reality would be a helpful start. From that new launch point may come adaptations to help us thrive in an automated future.",mainstream
104,"The immensely popular series Stranger Things puts in the forefront of popular culture the disturbing world of MKULTRA, mixed with a heavy those of fantasy and science fiction. Through its story and symbolism, the series tell a deeper truth about its subject matter, one that not many might believe or accept. We’ll look at the deeper meaning of Stranger Things.

Praised for its gripping story and stellar acting, Stranger Things quickly became a monster hit. Starring a group of Dungeon & Dragons playing kids who bike around their neighborhood while communicating on their Realistic™ walkie-talkies, the series brought a heavy dose of eighties nostalgia with a rare authenticity. More importantly, Stranger Things also brought to the forefront of popular culture a subject that has been taboo for decades: The world of MKULTRA and its horrifying practices. (If you don’t know about MKULTRA, please read this article first).

Continuously opposing truth with fiction, the horror of reality with the bliss of fantasy, the ugliness of mankind with the innocence of children, Stranger Things has a strong dualistic undertone. This is epitomized by the fact that the adventure takes place on two separate realms, the “real world” and the “Upside Down,” a dark, evil version of reality. Although separate, these realms are connected through a gateway, one that nearly nobody knows about. The existence of this gateway is hidden from the public, yet affects it in several ways. Stranger Things is about how those who rule us are involved in “stranger things” than most can even fathom. Through its story, characters and symbolism, it reveals the darker side of the elite … some of it. Let’s take a deeper look at the story.

The series begin with four friends, Mike, Will, Dustin and Lucas, playing Dungeons & Dragons. Mike, the dungeon master, sets up the premise of his friends’ quest. He also sets up the premise of the entire series.

While the boys are ultimately faced with the horrifying world of government mind control, their adventure is constantly compared to a Dungeons & Dragons quest. Will, the boy who gets abducted by the government, is the wizard of the party. The strength of wizards reside in their minds as they are capable of magic and other paranormal things such as teleportation and telekinesis. As we’ll see later, this is what Theta MKULTRA programming is about.

In this sense, the dark, disturbing aims of the occult elite is directly contrasted with the innocence and playfulness of children.

Essentially, the series’ creators are the dungeon masters taking the viewers on a 10-hour quest. But while D&D is about fantasy, the events happening in Stranger Things are based on some very strange things that actually happened.

Considering what happens in the series, the quote above, said by a clueless father, takes on a deeply ironic meaning. The story indeed describes a shadow government that exists no matter who is in office and that evolves entirely out of public view, partaking in programs, experiments, and missions that are completely beyond public knowledge while controlling the country’s entire resources and networks. In Stranger Things, the main organizations named are the CIA, the NSA and the Department of Energy.

The actual U.S. Department of Energy is one of those gigantic organizations that are massively funded by the federal government (it received 24 billion dollars in 2014) and operates a massive infrastructure all over the country. Yet, very few people truly know what happens inside those laboratories.

Stranger Things takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, where a National Laboratory acts as an MKULTRA programming site.

It is interesting to note that the series’ original title was Montauk and that it was supposed to take place in Montauk, NY. For those who have done some research on CIA mind control, this name should ring a bell. Montauk is the site of Camp Hero, the military base where the infamous and widely speculated Montauk Project took place.

The events on Long Island have come to be known as The Montauk Project. This phrase refers to a series of top-secret experiments in mind control, time travel, psychotronics, and the creation of black holes. These experiments were based out of an old Air Force radar station, or more accurately, in a vast complex hidden in the earth beneath this radar station. The military focused the efforts of the Montauk Project primarily on mind control experimentation. They gathered young males with psychic sensitivity, and in some cases, they supposedly even kidnapped these test subjects. These boys would sit in a specially developed chair aimed at enhancing their latent psychic abilities. This chair was being blasted with energy waves that allowed scientists to control their young subjects’ minds. Amazingly, it was discovered that the most adept of these young psychics were able to focus on objects so intensely that the objects would momentarily physically materialize. (…) According to legend, the base actually lost its funding in the late 1960s because the radar technology was obsolete, but was open until 1983. The area is now a New York state park, but the buildings are intact and radar equipment remains standing. Also, from what I learned, what is really strange is that while the government gave the land to the state, it still owns the land beneath the base. Apparently there are many levels beneath ground that were used for research and the base was really a cover-up. Some people say that is absolutely documented that there is a subterranean city beneath the base that is still being used today by secret branches of the military. People say that the radar equipment was built as a cover up so that the military could conduct experiments in time travel and mind control and this is what all the electronics equipment was for. The Montauk Air Force Station was said to have carried out numerous terrible experiments in cooperation with many research laboratories on Long Island. Apparently, this base was also in cooperation with Mitchell Air Force Base on Long Island.

 – Weird US, Military Mayhem in Montauk, Long Island

The creators of Stranger Things were clearly inspired by the Montauk project “legend”. The creators however ultimately chose to base the series in a fictional town in Indiana. While the location is different, the same shadow government is behind the action in Stranger Things.

In Stranger Things, the shadow government takes all of the necessary steps to cover its tracks: It spies on citizens, kills those who know too much (making it look like a suicide), fakes the death of abducted children, and hinders investigators searching for the truth. In short, the shadow government operates above the law and supersedes all levels of government.

Jim Hopper, the chief of police of Dawkins, slowly uncovers the scheme of the federal government.

Things definitely go too far. Not unlike what is claimed about the Montauk Project, the experiments at the National Laboratory in Stranger Things lead to the opening of a gateway to a dark dimension and the spawning of a faceless monster. Tapping into the darkest forces on Earth never leads to good things.

The Upside Down and the Demogorgon

The intense and dangerous experiments at the National Laboratory engender the creation of a portal leading to the Upside Down – a dark, evil version of the real world. The kids compare it to the Vale of Shadows in Dungeons & Dragons.

The portal leading this other dimension is so powerful that it alters the magnetic field of the area around it, causing compasses to point away from true North. Symbolically, this represents how the occult elite’s dealings are indirectly affecting the entire population.

The actual world of MKULTRA taps into the metaphysical realm, the esoteric and the occult – and not for benevolent purposes. Constantly and intensely drawing power from dark forces ultimately unleashes byproducts, which have an effect on the unsuspecting masses. In short, people lose their “true North”.

In Stranger Things, the byproduct that emerges from the Upside Down is a faceless monster – a creature the kids dub “Demogorgon”.

Although this monster is pure science fiction fodder, it symbolically represents the beastly, monstrous side of the “scientific” experiments of the occult elite. Attracted by the blood of children, Demogorgon makes them disappear from the surface of the Earth and takes them to Upside Down, which represents the dark, evil, dissociated world of the occult elite. When describing Demogorgon, the characters of the series all say that “it has no face” (much like the real-world MK system has no face). The name given to this monster, Demogorgon, is significant. It refers to a powerful demonic force:

The origins of the word Demogorgon itself refers to an evil entity mentioned by occult scholars.

In the series, Demogorgon represents the satanic elite that feeds on the blood of innocents, abducting children and using them to gain power.

At one point, Brenner, the MK handler, says a significant phrase:

Although this appears random, Brenner does repeat the word “six” three times while referring to those who were abducted in Hawkins. It is a coded way of saying that the missing children are fed to the 666 system? One thing is for sure, Will Byers is one of them.

Another victim of the system is Eleven, an MK slave who was abducted at birth.

Eleven is a young girl that escaped the National Laboratory using her “superpowers”. Through bits of information and flashbacks peppered throughout the series, the viewers eventually piece together the tragic story of Eleven – one that mirrors the fate of thousands of children who disappeared over the past decades. Indeed, through the story of Eleven, Stranger Things describes parts of the real-world MKULTRA program.

Eleven is the daughter of a woman named Terry who willingly took part in MKULTRA-related experiments.

Terry is convinced that Eleven was stolen from her by the CIA after a “miscarriage” in the third semester.

As stated in previous articles, female MK slaves are sometimes made to suffer through “miscarriages” to cause trauma. Babies born from these situations are easier to program because they’ve already been traumatized.

In Stranger Things, Eleven is born with a specific set of skills.

In MK terms, Eleven is a product of Theta programming, which is centered around extrasensory perception (ESP). There is nothing “science fiction” about this, however. It is documented that the CIA invested tens of millions of dollars into researching this field.

Theta Programming got its name just as the Alpha, Beta, and Delta Programming in part from the four types of EEG brain waves. Theta waves are frequent in children. Psychic warfare became a branch of the Monarch Programming. This is the Theta Programming. It is the marriage of occult practices with state of the art science. The idea to be able to copy what Elisha did to the King of Syria (2 KG 6:11-12) when he “telepathically” spied on the enemy, discovered their plans, and thereby ruined their chances of success. Today this has been called “ESPionage”, and the U.S. Army’s term is “psychotronics”. Of course, the CIA’s position is that they couldn’t find anything that worked, but that is simply not true, because the co-authors know of many Theta alters and Theta model systems which have Theta programming which is successful. Black magicians have been honing their skills on how to deflect magical attacks for centuries. Are their efforts superstition and empty nonsense, or do they really have efficacy? The Illuminati and Hitler believed in black magic. And in recent times, the other groups involved in trauma-based mind-control have also looked into magic based psychic warfare. The military and the Illuminati are using telepathy, psychic warfare, astral projection and other occult sciences with their programmed slaves. The ability to carry out some of these occult sciences (psychic abilities) can be greatly enhanced by certain drugs, brain wave patterns, training, and demonology.

 – Fritz Springmeier, The Illuminati Formula to Create a Mind Control Slave

Although Eleven has “superpowers” that are deemed “pretty awesome” by her friends, they are clearly the product of years of abuse. Since birth, she has been programmed by a handler she calls “Papa” (an actual word used in MK programming). After spending her life confined inside the walls of a laboratory, Eleven can barely communicate and shows numerous signs of past trauma.

Devoid of a core personality (it was denied by her handler), Eleven temporarily takes on an “alter” to evolve in the “real world”.

It is however inside the little house Mike built for her that Eleven gains some of her humanity back.

Other characters in the series are seen hiding in small shelters as well.

Despite several allusions to abuse peppered throughout the series, Eleven is nevertheless portrayed as a “superhero” with cool superpowers (she is compared to X-Men and Green Lantern).

The fact that her friends call her El (short for Eleven) is also significant. El is a Semitic word meaning “god” or “deity”. As seen above, there is a spiritual, metaphysical dimension to the entire series. The fact that El is in touch with the metaphysical confers her a “godly” aspect.

In the end, Eleven’s ultimate fate is kind of a mystery. After using her powers to destroy Demogorgon, she disappears with him. Did she die with it or did she go back in the hands of the MKULTRA system?

We do know that the police chief Hopper agreed to give up Eleven’s location in exchange for the government liberating Will. Hopper also promised to never talk about anything he discovered about the MK system. He tells Will’s mother:

In the end, Eleven is back where she “belongs” and the secrecy of the MK system is preserved. So, did the good guys truly win? Well, at least Will was rescued and went back to his family. That’s a good thing, right?

Although he was rescued from the Demogorgon and the MK system, Will’s ordeal will have lasting effects on him. Indeed, mind control programming and the elites’ demonic system disturb the mind, body, and soul forever.

Other than Will and Barb, who were physically abducted, other characters appear to be affected indirectly by the MK system. Indeed, through subtle clues, the series establishes a strong connection between Eleven – the MK slave – and Nancy – the perfect suburban girl.

The link between Eleven and Nancy

Although MKULTRA is a top-secret operation, the series implies that it has repercussions on the entire population. As stated above, the gateway causes compasses to point away from true North and, well, maybe, it does the same to moral compasses.

While Eleven is a strange, unique and enigmatic product of a fringe government experiment, Nancy is the exact opposite: A regular girl from a regular family living in a regular suburban neighborhood. However, both characters are linked through various scenes.

The series mirrors Nancy’s relationship with Steve – a guy who is kind of a jerk, kind of pushy and kind of manipulative – with the plight of Eleven, an MK slave programmed by a handler. Although Nancy is not forced to do anything, the series draws a strong parallel between her losing her innocence (having sex with Steve) and mind control – as if saying that the entire population is “under the spell” of this system.

Throughout the series, characters observe that, since she’s been with Steve, Nancy is a “different person”, the same way MK slaves become different persons. Dustin observes that “she used to be cool”. Barb tells Nancy: “This isn’t you”. Jonathan says about Nancy: “I saw this girl, you know, trying to be someone else”.

Nancy’s ultimate fate is also identical to Eleven’s. While she appeared to be breaking away from Steve’s apparently irresistible spell, she ends up going back with him.

While most critics focus on the “nostalgia” factor of Stranger Things, the series is about much more than 80’s aesthetics. It addresses a disturbing aspect of American history and, through overt and subtle symbolism, reveals the deeper, metaphysical implications of the elite’s never-ending quest for power.

Stranger Things is not a documentary, however. It is a “science fiction” show that ends up depicting MKULTRA as a weapon against communism. While subtly alluding to abuse, the series presents a rather whitewashed version of MKULTRA, one that is devoid of its more gruesome aspects. This might lead viewers to believe that MKULTRA is “not so bad” or worse, that it is all fiction.

In the end, the series accomplishes what symbolism does: It reveals to those in the know while concealing to those in ignorance. Either you believe that the story is an apt reflection of the powers that be and the dark forces that rule them … or it is nothing but a creepy Dungeon & Dragons quest told by masterful dungeon masters.",conspiracy
1038,"A group of men obsessed with traditional ideals of masculinity and femininity are hosting a convention that promises to 'Make Women Great Again.'

The 22 Convention will take place from May 1 to May 3, 2020 in Orlando, Florida, and the event organizers describe it as the 'world's ultimate event for women, by men.'

With a series of speakers, the convention aims to teach female attendees how to be 'ideal women,' warning them against 'unhealthy militant feminists,' teaching them that being fat isn't beautiful, and encouraging them to have 'unlimited babies' because 'the clock is ticking' — and all that for the price of $1,999.

The convention is being hosted by 21 Studios, which was founded by Anthony Dream Johnson.

It's taking place concurrently with the 21 Convention, a men-only convention which promotes a 'pro-father, pro-man, pro-masculinity.'

But while the 21 Convention has been occurring since 2007, its women-only counterpart is new this year.

The event website brags that it is 'destined to be the mansplaining event of the century' and goes on to explain its mission.

'Women today are being taught to act more like men. Where has that led us? Skyrocketing rates of divorce, depression, dysfunction, and America at the #1 spot in the world for single motherhood.

'No longer will you have to give in to toxic bullying feminist dogma and go against your ancient, biological nature as a woman,' the site reads.

Calling the event 'miraculous,' it goes on to list the topics that will be covered, including the organizers' claim that being overweight is unattractive.

'Being sick and obese ... is not beautiful. Taking good care of your body is beautiful in process and outcome. Men admire healthy, fit women,' the site reads.

'They are after all sizing you up for reproduction, and your decisions will be passed on to your children through the choices you make via epigenetics,' it goes on, adding that attendees will be shown how they've been 'lied to' about 'body positivity.'

The convention will also cover how, the men argue, 'femininity [is greater than] feminism.'

'Hiding under a mask of fake progress, feminism today has become a radical assault on all forms of positive femininity,' it reads.

'Through an onslaught of anti-feminine propaganda spanning generations, women today have been pushed to act like men and DENY their own feminine nature. This has left millions of women feeling unhappy, confused, frustrated, and hopeless.

'At The 22 Convention, you will learn the truth that unhealthy militant feminists have been hiding from you your entire life.'

It will also tackle what it calls 'the war on motherhood,' which seems to be the fault of unwed single mothers' and causes all the world's problems.

'Poverty, crime, mental health issues, and overall decline in well-being is rampant today in America and the West, thanks to feminist anti-motherhood propaganda,' the site reads.

The convention wants to encourage women to get married and reproduce — and sooner, rather than later.

'Generations of women have been lied to with “you can have it all,” a clever way of tricking them into de-prioritizing motherhood until ~90% of their eggs are dead by 30.'

As the men behind the 22 Convention would have it, women would have 'unlimited babies' — and they warn women that 'the clock is ticking'

'For decades, feminism has derided women who want to prioritize motherhood and family. Shamed them, mocked them, ridiculed them as servants of some mysterious patriarchy boogeyman,' the site reads.

'Our speakers will teach you how to have as many babies as your heart desires with the time you have left and bounce back to amazing health and wellness without extreme diets or stress.'

As for getting to the baby-making part, the convention also tackles dating.

'The truth is that both positive masculinity and femininity have been under relentless attack for decades. Both have taken catastrophic social, cultural, personal, and philosophic damage for tens of millions of people.

'The result is a depolarized mess where men act like women, women act like men, everyone’s confused, and nothing ""works.""'

The organizers want attendees to 'raise their femininity' by falling into historically feminine roles.

'For the past several hundred thousand years of human life on this planet, masculine men have preferred feminine women in all areas of life; from the kitchen to the bedroom, dating to relationships, marriage, family, and beyond,' the site reads.

'High quality masculine men want high quality feminine women to mother their children and set great examples for their daughters.'

The speakers will also teach women how to be the 'ultimate wife' and 'get in the best shape ever.'

Several speakers have already been lined up for the event, including Anthony Dream Johnson himself, and Alexander J. A. Cortes — who famously went viral for his tweet about 'how to be a beautiful woman.'

His tips in the tweet — which were widely mocked and attacked — included 'be thin,' 'have long hair, 'shave,' 'wear pink,' and 'listen to men.'

Other speakers include white nationalist Stefan Molyneux, Elliott Hulse, men's rights activist and Pizzagate promoter Mike Cernovich, George Bruno, Ken Curry, Goldmund Unleashed, Texas Dom, Steve Williams, and red pill podcaster Donovan Sharpe.

The speakers, the site says, are 'not going to tell women what they want to hear, but what they need to hear: the truth.'

'Women today are being indoctrinated into toxic feminist ideology at an epidemic rate and are being lead astray into lives filled with depression, barren wombs, and loneliness,' the site says.

Johnson, the founder, says 'women benefit from positive, masculine voices in their lives and surrounding culture.'

78,"Roy Keane and Thierry Henry opened up old wounds when the pair argued over Arsenal and Manchester United's infamous 2003 Premier League clash.

The fiery fixture, which finished 0-0, left four Gunners stars suspended.

Patrick Vieira was sent off in the 80th minute after kicking out at Ruud van Nistelrooy, a decision which left Martin Keown furious.

The Dutchman later missed a last-minute penalty, causing Keown, Lauren, Ray Parlour, Ashley Cole and Kolo Toure to confront the striker.

Arsenal were fined £175,000 and warned, while Keown, Lauren, Parlour and Vieira all received bans.

During a Premier League broadcast on Sky Sports, Keane and Henry watched footage of the incidents again and began to squabble over what they saw.

Here's how their exchange went down:

Keane: ""They should be [regretful], to me, I don’t mind lads getting stuck in but that behaviour is disgraceful. I know lads got in trouble, [Ray] Parlour...""

Henry: ""Let's go back to why that happened, let's all remember, it's not because Van Nistelrooy missed the penalty. The whole day - and I love Van Nistelrooy - but during the whole game he winded everyone up.""

Henry: ""He got Patrick sent off.""

Keane: ""Patrick got himself sent off.""

Henry: ""Remember the whole history. All I'm saying is, that's why those guys felt that something was going wrong on the day. Not because he missed the penalty, that's why they went at him, the way he behaved on the day. I called that, it was them sometimes, sometimes it was us.""

Keane: ""We never did anything like that [during Arsenal-United games]. United players would never. Arsenal players crossed that line, definitely.""

The Frenchman also spoke about Gary Neville's actions in United's 2-0 win over Arsenal the following season. The ex-Red Devils right back appeared to target Jose Antonio Reyes during the fixture.

Henry: ""I wasn't one of them [the aggressors in the 2003 game]! But what I'm trying to say is it was all right then for Gary Neville to kick Jose Reyes? Me, ankle...""

Keane: ""But Gary was slowing down at the time, maybe he was genuinely trying to get the ball, maybe.""

Henry: ""I don't agree with that one but I saw it on the day and I thought next time it will be us, next time it will be you.""

Keane: ""Why does Martin Keown regret that? Martin has done some daft things on the pitch, so if that's one that he regrets.""

Henry: ""I will be honest with you, I don't agree with that [with what Keown did], that doesn't look right.""

United ended Arsenal's Premier League unbeaten run that day and, again, the game wasn't without controversy. Alex Ferguson and Wenger clashed in the players' tunnel and a slice of pizza was thrown at the Scot.

Henry: ""Yeah, another thing, when Arsene went at it with Sir Alex in the tunnel and the next thing you know, everyone comes... then I saw a piece of pizza flew over my head and landed on the face of Sir Alex... but I miss those days.

Keane: ""It was the one game I missed in about 15 years with illness, which was the Pizzagate. Probably just as well.""",mainstream
314,"One was that if sport is indeed the playpen of life, it is one where truth has a way of wriggling - or in this case roaring - into the open. Here, over the last week or so, truth has been as rampant as the All Black heroes, Tana Umaga, Daniel Carter and Richie McCaw.

Truth has mauled and rucked and run into the ground the idea that sport can be manipulated like a political campaign, that somehow the spin doctoring skills of an Alastair Campbell had any place in the Lions tradition that down the years has been about so much of the best of our sporting life.

In New Zealand, the sporting life does not lack a serious debate. But it is one which is conducted in terms that are a planet away from the broiling controversies of, say, the Premiership. There is a degree of competitive respect and analysis which is stunning. Pizzagate couldn't happen here. Nor the Ashley Cole affair. Nor the Mourinho style of shaping events - and the career of a leading referee.

If Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger conducted their arguments here in the way that they do in England, they would have to do so in a back room. There would be no public appetite for their blaring self-interest. Here there is simply too much respect for the idea of sport and its deepest values.

First in Christchurch, then here this last weekend, Campbell's professional conviction that in sport you can twist something as basic as crushing defeat into the status of victimhood - and that anything other than a brief blurring of reality can result - has been shattered. It gives nothing, Campbell must know now, other than an extra cause for already committed opponents.

What works in the corridors of Westminster and some corners of Fleet Street, the All Blacks have declared with an intensity of shocking but cleansing force, is doomed to failure in the truth test of sport. You could not fudge the figures at the Jade or Westpac stadiums. They shone out from the scoreboards: All Blacks 21 Lions 3; All Blacks 48 Lions 18.

New Zealand, weary of the Lions' propaganda, were almost dizzy with vindication. One newspaper ran on its front page the first Test score in bold numbers and said: ""Spin that, Lions.""

Campbell could play up the devastating loss of the Lions captain Brian O'Driscoll in the first minute of the first Test, he could spin distraction for a week, but whom and what did it serve? It couldn't bring back the vibrant skills of O'Driscoll and still less could it effectively brand Umaga, the All Blacks captain, a thug. Soon enough the players had to go back on the field, and when they did where did that leave Campbell? A figure of deeply felt contempt in this land where rugby is as much a staple of life as a loaf of bread. The All Black coach Graham Henry was asked if he had highlighted as motivational tools some of the headlines. His face was filled with contempt and he said: ""There isn't enough wallpaper to put up all that crap - and why would we bother? We know who and what we are.""

Umaga didn't suddenly recreate himself as some sinister assassin in the rain and sleet of Christchurch. His first Test against the Lions came after years of superb service to the All Blacks and, if he was reckless in the way he helped his team-mate Keven Mealamu clear out a ruck, the idea that O'Driscoll had been coldly targeted had no credence among men who had played the game at the highest level and, like everyone here, were obliged to study rerun after rerun of inconclusive film.

It didn't suit the Campbell script that when a trophy room in Umaga's house in a green valley over the hill from here is finally decorated, pride of place will go to the Fair Play award he was given after he abandoned play and rushed to the aid of an unconscious opponent, the Welsh flanker Colin Charvis. Umaga moved Charvis into the recovery position and checked that he hadn't swallowed his tongue.

Because of the impact of the dramatic demonstration of his team-mate Carter that he now had to be considered the world's best rugby player, some of the meaning of Umaga's performance in the second Test may have been lost. But not in his home town of Wainuiomata. There, they knew the pride of Umaga, his contribution to the Samoan and Maori community, and the fact that he would never play a more important rugby match. As it happened, the All Black captain's effort in Wellington was monumental - and no one doubted that much of its motivation had come from the campaign launched by Campbell after the first Test. Spin was not so much defeated as ransacked. The last week of the tour, whatever the Lions' head coach Sir Clive Woodward says, is a nightmare competitive void. The Test series has been lost and the All Blacks, denied the services of the luminous Carter, have little to prove.

All that is left is a degree of recognition that almost everything about this Lions expedition was wrong: its excessive, unwieldy size, its lack of proper match preparation, even its moral base as represented by that unprecedented campaign of spin. It may be that in the next few days Woodward will step out of a mood of denial that in the wake of the second Test was painful to see. He may finally grasp that just as he got almost everything right in his World Cup campaign with England, here his misjudgements have fed on each other. One statement alone after the second Test indicated that he had become lost in the moral maze. When his All Black opposite number, Henry, said that punching had no place in rugby, Woodward said it happened - and that players tended not to get injured from punching. He was back in the worn-out O'Driscoll controversy. Now he was spinning his wheels as well as the facts.

There are more than a few lessons to be learnt from the four million New Zealanders who invest so heavily in their national sport. You cannot go about the beautiful land without being impressed by the depth of the commitment to the game. While football-obsessed England fills its national game with foreigners, New Zealand makes its Richie McCaws and Daniel Carters with infinite care.

One abiding memory will be a journey to Carter's home town of Southbridge on a winter's afternoon when six and seven-year-olds were being coached on one of the fields where the national hero learnt the game. The club president spoke of a pride that he knew would be shared by every small town in New Zealand. ""Danny's success,"" he said, ""is the national dream and it is worked for day in, day out. You can go to any little town and you will see the meaning of rugby, and I cannot tell you how much Danny's success has brought to us. It touches everything.""

That is the unchanging backcloth of All Black rugby - and the explanation of why it has maintained its strength and is once again poised to beat the world.

The Lions, at a cost of £9m, came here to show New Zealand the way to do it. The leader of the expedition will now take his skills to the world of football. Woodward believes he can impose new levels of organisation and business values on a sport with which he is not familiar. Maybe - maybe not. But if we are talking truth, and the basis of all success in sport, maybe he can help himself and his football club Southampton by taking home a little extra baggage for himself.

It should contain the hardest-earned lesson of these last few weeks. It is that there is only one place to fashion lasting success in sport. It is in the hearts and the minds of your players, and in the trust and respect you give them. Here in New Zealand you see that respect around every corner. Everything else, they know here, simply falls into place. It is has nothing to do with spin - only truth in the most important place of all, out on the field.",mainstream

Federal authorities were looking for a man Saturday for questioning in an arson fire at a Washington pizzeria known for being a target of conspiracy theorists.

The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives circulated imagery of a man taken from security video following the Wednesday night fire at the Comet Ping Pong pizza shop in Washington.

""ATF is seeking the pictured suspect for questioning,"" the agency tweeted.

Vito Maggiolo, spokesman for the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, said pizzeria employees had extinguished the fire by the time firefighters arrived. No injuries were reported.

""It involved some curtains in the rear of the restaurant,"" Maggiolo said. ""It was a deliberately set fire.""

A task force comprised of the ATF, the city fire department and the Metropolitan Police Department was investigating, he said. He called the man wanted for questioning a ""person of interest.""

It wasn't clear if the fire was connected to conspiracy theories that have dogged the eatery.

In 2016, Comet was targeted by some users of Reddit and 4chan discussion groups online who said a child sex ring was being operated out of the business' basement.

The business does not have a basement. Conspiracy theorists posted that readers could uncover a child sex ring in the hacked emails of John Podesta — if only one were to replace words like “pizza” with “little girl.”

Podesta casually knows the owner of Comet and once mentioned a fundraiser for President Obama at the restaurant.

The ""Pizzagate"" conspiracies were widely seen as a prelude to the blossoming of a community of online conspiracy theorists known as Qanon.

On Dec. 4, 2017 Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, traveled from North Carolina to Washington to rescue sex trafficking victims he believed were being held at the restaurant. He brought an AR-15 rifle and a .38 caliber handgun with him and opened fire on a door he couldn't open, authorities said. No one was injured.

He was later convicted of federal and local weapons charges.

""We are still searching for a suspect or suspects,"" said Maggiolo of the city fire department.",mainstream
1248,"UPDATE: A day after Twitter permanently banned Alex Jones and Infowars, Apple announced Friday night that it has also permanently removed the Infowars app from its App Store, Buzzfeed News reports. The Infowars app had remained in the Apple App Store even after Apple removed all of Jones and Infowars‘ podcasts in early August.

Apple has removed the majority of Alex Jones and Infowars‘ podcasts from its iTunes and Podcast apps. It is the latest tech company after Facebook, Spotify and YouTube to take action against the fringe conspiracy-pushing host.

“Apple does not tolerate hate speech, and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users,” an Apple spokesperson said (via Buzzfeed).

“Podcasts that violate these guidelines are removed from our directory making them no longer searchable or available for download or streaming. We believe in representing a wide range of views, so long as people are respectful to those with differing opinions.”

Five of Jones’ six podcasts on Apple, including The Alex Jones Show, were erased from Apple’s apps Sunday; although the apps didn’t host or profit off the Infowars offshoots, Apple served as an important outlet for the controversial podcasts, which have pushed theories like Pizzagate and incited the harassment the victims of mass shootings. Only Infowars offshoot Real News With David Knight remained available on the apps.

In recent months, Facebook, Spotify and YouTube partially or temporarily barred Jones and Infowars from their prospective platforms. On Monday morning, Facebook – which previously temporarily banned Jones’ personal Facebook page – upped their stance against Jones by taking down four pages associated with Infowars.

“We believe in giving people a voice, but we also want everyone using Facebook to feel safe. It’s why we have Community Standards and remove anything that violates them, including hate speech that attacks or dehumanizes others,” Facebook said in a statement Monday. “Earlier today, we removed four Pages belonging to Alex Jones for repeatedly posting content over the past several days that breaks those Community Standards.”

On August 1st, Spotify pulled a handful of Alex Jones Show episodes from the streaming service; on Monday, Spotify removed the remaining episodes of the show. However, three other Jones podcasts remain available on the streaming service.",mainstream

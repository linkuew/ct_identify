1067,"Mary Berry has made a huge food confession - explaining that she has never once had a take-away meal.

The 82-year-old baking expert has made a career out of instructing food fanatics how to get their sponge to rise and avoid a soggy bottom.

But the former Bake Off star may have left some fans with a bad taste in the mouth by revealing she shuns fast food.

However she does admit a good meal deal will get her juices flowing.

""I’ve never had a takeaway. I’d have to go and fetch it!” the star laughed to The Times Magazine.

""But I will go into M&S on my way home and buy a £10 meal. That to me is more fun than a takeaway,” she added - showing off her wild side.

As the interview progressed, Mary revealed she has essentially rejected fake ingredients for her own body much like she might do while baking.

The star explained she is enjoying growing old gracefully and it sounds like she would never go under the knife.

""No facelifts, nothing,” she said.

""No [botox]. I’ve got wrinkles, That’s what happens when you get older. It doesn’t worry me. I use E45 from a big bottle,” the all natural beauty added.",mainstream,M1bf34,pizzagate

It has even stronger connections to pedophilia and Satanism and connects some of the most influential people in the US, including: Barack Obama, George Soros, John Podesta, Tony Podesta, Hillary Clinton, convicted billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and James Alefantis who is “one of DC’s 50 most powerful people”.

You will learn that George Soros donated $20k to ‘Comet Ping Pong’ pizza restaurant, owned by James Alefantis and where Obama goes frequently and even held a fundraiser.

According to one email: “Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party.”

Pizza and [hot-]dogs are alleged pedophile codes for “young girls” and “young boys.” You will see more references for yourself and, put into a wider perspective, the codes make sense.

In the following infographic, by connecting the people in the ‘Podesta Emails’ and their alleged ‘pedophilia codes’ you will see strong references to:
• sex with children of both sexes and various ages (pedophilia codes, such as: pizza = young girl, hotdog = young boy, etc.)
• images from the Satanic ‘Spirit Cooking’ dinner hosted by “artist” Marina Abramovic and attended by John Podesta and his brother Tony, James Alefantis, Lady Gaga, etc.
• leaked picture of John Podesta making reference to “elite” god Osiris, which was murdered by his brother Seth and chopped into 14 pieces (his penis was never recovered because it was eaten by a fish):
• references to Moloch, the god of child sacrifice (Moloch is just one of the many names of Anunnaki god Marduk — Earth’s ruler after Enki was dethroned)
• shady images of children posted by James Alefantis on his Instagram account, containing the already mentioned pedophilia hashtags
• business logos that are very similar to symbols used by pedophiles to identify their sexual preferences
• pizza restaurants that are possibly connected to this alleged Satanic network of pedophiles and child killers
• pictures of an empty underground room containing the hashtags #killroom and #murder

And let’s not forget the “Sacrificing a Chicken to Moloch” email, where “chicken” is believed to be a code-word for “child.”

Satanist ‘artist’ Marina Abramović poses with Jacob Rothschild, who is also a lover of the ‘arts’… The painting behind them ‘just happens’ to be “Satan summoning his Legions” (1797), by Sir Thomas Lawrence… Also notice how the painting is lighted ESPECIALLY for this photo, with focus on Satan’s eyes.

599,"WASHINGTON — Four minutes into a video that was posted on Instagram last month, Justin Bieber leaned into the camera and adjusted the front of his black knit beanie. For some of his 130 million followers, it was a signal.

In the video, someone had posted a comment asking Mr. Bieber to touch his hat if he had been a victim of a child-trafficking ring known as PizzaGate. Thousands of comments were flooding in, and there was no evidence that Mr. Bieber had seen that message. But the pop star’s innocuous gesture set off a flurry of online activity, which highlighted the resurgence of one of social media’s early conspiracy theories.

Viewers quickly uploaded hundreds of videos online analyzing Mr. Bieber’s action. The videos were translated into Spanish, Portuguese and other languages, amassing millions of views. Fans then left thousands of comments on Mr. Bieber’s social media posts asking him if he was safe. Within days, searches for “Justin and PizzaGate” soared on Google, and the hashtag #savebieber started trending.

Four years ago, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, the baseless notion that Hillary Clinton and Democratic elites were running a child sex-trafficking ring out of a Washington pizzeria spread across the internet, illustrating how a crackpot idea with no truth to it could blossom on social media — and how dangerous it could be. In December 2016, a vigilante gunman showed up at the restaurant with an assault rifle and opened fire into a closet.",mainstream,M0a186,pizzagate
1141,"n March 2, a disturbing report hit the desks of U.S. counterintelligence officials in Washington. For months, American spy hunters had scrambled to uncover details of Russia’s influence operation against the 2016 presidential election. In offices in both D.C. and suburban Virginia, they had created massive wall charts to track the different players in Russia’s multipronged scheme. But the report in early March was something new.

It described how Russia had already moved on from the rudimentary email hacks against politicians it had used in 2016. Now the Russians were running a more sophisticated hack on Twitter. The report said the Russians had sent expertly tailored messages carrying malware to more than 10,000 Twitter users in the Defense Department. Depending on the interests of the targets, the messages offered links to stories on recent sporting events or the Oscars, which had taken place the previous weekend. When clicked, the links took users to a Russian-controlled server that downloaded a program allowing Moscow’s hackers to take control of the victim’s phone or computer–and Twitter account.

As they scrambled to contain the damage from the hack and regain control of any compromised devices, the spy hunters realized they faced a new kind of threat. In 2016, Russia had used thousands of covert human agents and robot computer programs to spread disinformation referencing the stolen campaign emails of Hillary Clinton, amplifying their effect. Now counterintelligence officials wondered: What chaos could Moscow unleash with thousands of Twitter handles that spoke in real time with the authority of the armed forces of the United States? At any given moment, perhaps during a natural disaster or a terrorist attack, Pentagon Twitter accounts might send out false information. As each tweet corroborated another, and covert Russian agents amplified the messages even further afield, the result could be panic and confusion.

For many Americans, Russian hacking remains a story about the 2016 election. But there is another story taking shape. Marrying a hundred years of expertise in influence operations to the new world of social media, Russia may finally have gained the ability it long sought but never fully achieved in the Cold War: to alter the course of events in the U.S. by manipulating public opinion. The vast openness and anonymity of social media has cleared a dangerous new route for antidemocratic forces. “Using these technologies, it is possible to undermine democratic government, and it’s becoming easier every day,” says Rand Waltzman of the Rand Corp., who ran a major Pentagon research program to understand the propaganda threats posed by social media technology.

Current and former officials at the FBI, at the CIA and in Congress now believe the 2016 Russian operation was just the most visible battle in an ongoing information war against global democracy. And they’ve become more vocal about their concern. “If there has ever been a clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the very foundation of our democratic political system, this episode is it,” former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified before Congress on May 8.

If that sounds alarming, it helps to understand the battlescape of this new information war. As they tweet and like and upvote their way through social media, Americans generate a vast trove of data on what they think and how they respond to ideas and arguments–literally thousands of expressions of belief every second on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Google. All of those digitized convictions are collected and stored, and much of that data is available commercially to anyone with sufficient computing power to take advantage of it.

That’s where the algorithms come in. American researchers have found they can use mathematical formulas to segment huge populations into thousands of subgroups according to defining characteristics like religion and political beliefs or taste in TV shows and music. Other algorithms can determine those groups’ hot-button issues and identify “followers” among them, pinpointing those most susceptible to suggestion. Propagandists can then manually craft messages to influence them, deploying covert provocateurs, either humans or automated computer programs known as bots, in hopes of altering their behavior.

That is what Moscow is doing, more than a dozen senior intelligence officials and others investigating Russia’s influence operations tell TIME. The Russians “target you and see what you like, what you click on, and see if you’re sympathetic or not sympathetic,” says a senior intelligence official. Whether and how much they have actually been able to change Americans’ behavior is hard to say. But as they have investigated the Russian 2016 operation, intelligence and other officials have found that Moscow has developed sophisticated tactics.

In one case last year, senior intelligence officials tell TIME, a Russian soldier based in Ukraine successfully infiltrated a U.S. social media group by pretending to be a 42-year-old American housewife and weighing in on political debates with specially tailored messages. In another case, officials say, Russia created a fake Facebook account to spread stories on political issues like refugee resettlement to targeted reporters they believed were susceptible to influence.

As Russia expands its cyberpropaganda efforts, the U.S. and its allies are only just beginning to figure out how to fight back. One problem: the fear of Russian influence operations can be more damaging than the operations themselves. Eager to appear more powerful than they are, the Russians would consider it a success if you questioned the truth of your news sources, knowing that Moscow might be lurking in your Facebook or Twitter feed. But figuring out if they are is hard. Uncovering “signals that indicate a particular handle is a state-sponsored account is really, really difficult,” says Jared Cohen, CEO of Jigsaw, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which tackles global security challenges.

Like many a good spy tale, the story of how the U.S. learned its democracy could be hacked started with loose lips. In May 2016, a Russian military intelligence officer bragged to a colleague that his organization, known as the GRU, was getting ready to pay Clinton back for what President Vladimir Putin believed was an influence operation she had run against him five years earlier as Secretary of State. The GRU, he said, was going to cause chaos in the upcoming U.S. election.

What the officer didn’t know, senior intelligence officials tell TIME, was that U.S. spies were listening. They wrote up the conversation and sent it back to analysts at headquarters, who turned it from raw intelligence into an official report and circulated it. But if the officer’s boast seems like a red flag now, at the time U.S. officials didn’t know what to make of it. “We didn’t really understand the context of it until much later,” says the senior intelligence official. Investigators now realize that the officer’s boast was the first indication U.S. spies had from their sources that Russia wasn’t just hacking email accounts to collect intelligence but was also considering interfering in the vote. Like much of America, many in the U.S. government hadn’t imagined the kind of influence operation that Russia was preparing to unleash on the 2016 election. Fewer still realized it had been five years in the making.

In 2011, protests in more than 70 cities across Russia had threatened Putin’s control of the Kremlin. The uprising was organized on social media by a popular blogger named Alexei Navalny, who used his blog as well as Twitter and Facebook to get crowds in the streets. Putin’s forces broke out their own social media technique to strike back. When bloggers tried to organize nationwide protests on Twitter using #Triumfalnaya, pro-Kremlin botnets bombarded the hashtag with anti-protester messages and nonsense tweets, making it impossible for Putin’s opponents to coalesce.

Putin publicly accused then Secretary of State Clinton of running a massive influence operation against his country, saying she had sent “a signal” to protesters and that the State Department had actively worked to fuel the protests. The State Department said it had just funded pro-democracy organizations. Former officials say any such operations–in Russia or elsewhere–would require a special intelligence finding by the President and that Barack Obama was not likely to have issued one.

After his re-election the following year, Putin dispatched his newly installed head of military intelligence, Igor Sergun, to begin repurposing cyberweapons previously used for psychological operations in war zones for use in electioneering. Russian intelligence agencies funded “troll farms,” botnet spamming operations and fake news outlets as part of an expanding focus on psychological operations in cyberspace.

It turns out Putin had outside help. One particularly talented Russian programmer who had worked with social media researchers in the U.S. for 10 years had returned to Moscow and brought with him a trove of algorithms that could be used in influence operations. He was promptly hired by those working for Russian intelligence services, senior intelligence officials tell TIME. “The engineer who built them the algorithms is U.S.-trained,” says the senior intelligence official.

Soon, Putin was aiming his new weapons at the U.S. Following Moscow’s April 2014 invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. considered sanctions that would block the export of drilling and fracking technologies to Russia, putting out of reach some $8.2 trillion in oil reserves that could not be tapped without U.S. technology. As they watched Moscow’s intelligence operations in the U.S., American spy hunters saw Russian agents applying their new social media tactics on key aides to members of Congress. Moscow’s agents broadcast material on social media and watched how targets responded in an attempt to find those who might support their cause, the senior intelligence official tells TIME. “The Russians started using it on the Hill with staffers,” the official says, “to see who is more susceptible to continue this program [and] to see who would be more favorable to what they want to do.”

On Aug. 7, 2016, the infamous pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli declared that Hillary Clinton had Parkinson’s. That story went viral in late August, then took on a life of its own after Clinton fainted from pneumonia and dehydration at a Sept. 11 event in New York City. Elsewhere people invented stories saying Pope Francis had endorsed Trump and Clinton had murdered a DNC staffer. Just before Election Day, a story took off alleging that Clinton and her aides ran a pedophile ring in the basement of a D.C. pizza parlor.

Congressional investigators are looking at how Russia helped stories like these spread to specific audiences. Counterintelligence officials, meanwhile, have picked up evidence that Russia tried to target particular influencers during the election season who they reasoned would help spread the damaging stories. These officials have seen evidence of Russia using its algorithmic techniques to target the social media accounts of particular reporters, senior intelligence officials tell TIME. “It’s not necessarily the journal or the newspaper or the TV show,” says the senior intelligence official. “It’s the specific reporter that they find who might be a little bit slanted toward believing things, and they’ll hit him” with a flood of fake news stories.

Russia plays in every social media space. The intelligence officials have found that Moscow’s agents bought ads on Facebook to target specific populations with propaganda. “They buy the ads, where it says sponsored by–they do that just as much as anybody else does,” says the senior intelligence official. (A Facebook official says the company has no evidence of that occurring.) The ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia, has said he is looking into why, for example, four of the top five Google search results the day the U.S. released a report on the 2016 operation were links to Russia’s TV propaganda arm, RT. (Google says it saw no meddling in this case.) Researchers at the University of Southern California, meanwhile, found that nearly 20% of political tweets in 2016 between Sept. 16 and Oct. 21 were generated by bots of unknown origin; investigators are trying to figure out how many were Russian.

As they dig into the viralizing of such stories, congressional investigations are probing not just Russia’s role but whether Moscow had help from the Trump campaign. Sources familiar with the investigations say they are probing two Trump-linked organizations: Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics company hired by the campaign that is partly owned by deep-pocketed Trump backer Robert Mercer; and Breitbart News, the right-wing website formerly run by Trump’s top political adviser Stephen Bannon.

The congressional investigators are looking at ties between those companies and right-wing web personalities based in Eastern Europe who the U.S. believes are Russian fronts, a source familiar with the investigations tells TIME. “Nobody can prove it yet,” the source says. In March, McClatchy newspapers reported that FBI counterintelligence investigators were probing whether far-right sites like Breitbart News and Infowars had coordinated with Russian botnets to blitz social media with anti-Clinton stories, mixing fact and fiction when Trump was doing poorly in the campaign.

There are plenty of people who are skeptical of such a conspiracy, if one existed. Cambridge Analytica touts its ability to use algorithms to microtarget voters, but veteran political operatives have found them ineffective political influencers. Ted Cruz first used their methods during the primary, and his staff ended up concluding they had wasted their money. Mercer, Bannon, Breitbart News and the White House did not answer questions about the congressional probes. A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica says the company has no ties to Russia or individuals acting as fronts for Moscow and that it is unaware of the probe.

Democratic operatives searching for explanations for Clinton’s loss after the election investigated social media trends in the three states that tipped the vote for Trump: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In each they found what they believe is evidence that key swing voters were being drawn to fake news stories and anti-Clinton stories online. Google searches for the fake pedophilia story circulating under the hashtag #pizzagate, for example, were disproportionately higher in swing districts and not in districts likely to vote for Trump.

The Democratic operatives created a package of background materials on what they had found, suggesting the search behavior might indicate that someone had successfully altered the behavior in key voting districts in key states. They circulated it to fellow party members who are up for a vote in 2018.

Even as investigators try to piece together what happened in 2016, they are worrying about what comes next. Russia claims to be able to alter events using cyberpropaganda and is doing what it can to tout its power. In February 2016, a Putin adviser named Andrey Krutskikh compared Russia’s information-warfare strategies to the Soviet Union’s obtaining a nuclear weapon in the 1940s, David Ignatius of the Washington Post reported. “We are at the verge of having something in the information arena which will allow us to talk to the Americans as equals,” Krutskikh said.

But if Russia is clearly moving forward, it’s less clear how active the U.S. has been. Documents released by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and published by the Intercept suggested that the British were pursuing social media propaganda and had shared their tactics with the U.S. Chris Inglis, the former No. 2 at the National Security Agency, says the U.S. has not pursued this capability. “The Russians are 10 years ahead of us in being willing to make use of” social media to influence public opinion, he says.

There are signs that the U.S. may be playing in this field, however. From 2010 to 2012, the U.S. Agency for International Development established and ran a “Cuban Twitter” network designed to undermine communist control on the island. At the same time, according to the Associated Press, which discovered the program, the U.S. government hired a contractor to profile Cuban cell phone users, categorizing them as “pro-revolution,” “apolitical” or “antirevolutionary.”

Much of what is publicly known about the mechanics and techniques of social media propaganda comes from a program at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that the Rand researcher, Waltzman, ran to study how propagandists might manipulate social media in the future. In the Cold War, operatives might distribute disinformation-laden newspapers to targeted political groups or insinuate an agent provocateur into a group of influential intellectuals. By harnessing computing power to segment and target literally millions of people in real time online, Waltzman concluded, you could potentially change behavior “on the scale of democratic governments.”

In the U.S., public scrutiny of such programs is usually enough to shut them down. In 2014, news articles appeared about the DARPA program and the “Cuban Twitter” project. It was only a year after Snowden had revealed widespread monitoring programs by the government. The DARPA program, already under a cloud, was allowed to expire quietly when its funding ran out in 2015.

In the wake of Russia’s 2016 election hack, the question is how to research social media propaganda without violating civil liberties. The need is all the more urgent because the technology continues to advance. While today humans are still required to tailor and distribute messages to specially targeted “susceptibles,” in the future crafting and transmitting emotionally powerful messages will be automated.

The U.S. government is constrained in what kind of research it can fund by various laws protecting citizens from domestic propaganda, government electioneering and intrusions on their privacy. Waltzman has started a group called Information Professionals Association with several former information operations officers from the U.S. military to develop defenses against social media influence operations.

Social media companies are beginning to realize that they need to take action. Facebook issued a report in April 2017 acknowledging that much disinformation had been spread on its pages and saying it had expanded its security. Google says it has seen no evidence of Russian manipulation of its search results but has updated its algorithms just in case. Twitter claims it has diminished cyberpropaganda by tweaking its algorithms to block cleverly designed bots. “Our algorithms currently work to detect when Twitter accounts are attempting to manipulate Twitter’s Trends through inorganic activity, and then automatically adjust,” the company said in a statement.

In the meantime, America’s best option to protect upcoming votes may be to make it harder for Russia and other bad actors to hide their election-related information operations. When it comes to defeating Russian influence operations, the answer is “transparency, transparency, transparency,” says Rhode Island Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. He has written legislation that would curb the massive, anonymous campaign contributions known as dark money and the widespread use of shell corporations that he says make Russian cyberpropaganda harder to trace and expose.

But much damage has already been done. “The ultimate impact of [the 2016 Russian operation] is we’re never going to look at another election without wondering, you know, Is this happening, can we see it happening?” says Jigsaw’s Jared Cohen. By raising doubts about the validity of the 2016 vote and the vulnerability of future elections, Russia has achieved its most important objective: undermining the credibility of American democracy.

For now, investigators have added the names of specific trolls and botnets to their wall charts in the offices of intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. They say the best way to compete with the Russian model is by having a better message. “It requires critical thinkers and people who have a more powerful vision” than the cynical Russian view, says former NSA deputy Inglis. And what message is powerful enough to take on the firehose of falsehoods that Russia is deploying in targeted, effective ways across a range of new media? One good place to start: telling the truth.

Two weapons were found at the scene and a third in the man's care. He has been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon.

The 28-year-old man from North Carolina entered Comet Ping Pong restaurant to ""self-investigate"" a right-wing online conspiracy know as ""pizzagate,"" alleging the pizzeria is the center of a child sex ring reaching to the highest levels of Washington's political elite.

""During a post arrest interview this evening, the suspect revealed that he came to the establishment to self-investigate 'pizzagate' (a fictitious online conspiracy theory),"" police said in a statement.

Comet Ping Pong and its owner James Alefantis have faced online harassment and threats since the pizzagate story spread online in October ahead of the presidential election.

Pizzagate conspiracy theorists allege Alefantis, a former boyfriend of Democratic operative and journalist David Brock, runs a child sex ring out of Comet Ping Pong that involves many members of the Democratic Party. The conspiracy theory emerged from online chat forums 4chan and Reddit and quickly spread to various right-wing websites.

The original conspiracy developed from the Wikileaks emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chief John Podesta and pictures on Alefantis' Instagram account that pizzagate conspiracy theorists say point to the eating establishment being a center of pedophilia.

A number of media outlets have written articles debunking the pizzagate conspiracy. However, the theory continues to grow as its believers attack mainstream media and demand an FBI investigation. Instead, authorities are investigating repeated threats against Alefantis.

Alefantis said in a statement the incident shows that ""promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories"" can lead to real and potentially dangerous consequences. ""I hope that those involved in fanning these flames will take a moment to contemplate what happened here today, and stop promoting these falsehoods right away.""

Online, many pizza conspiracy theorists responded that the incident on Sunday was a false flag operation and they would not give up until the case was investigated.

Pizzagate is part of long-running right-wing allegations about widespread pedophilia in government, often centered on the Democratic Party and the Clinton family.

The conspiracy in some ways ties in with the case of billionaire and convicted child sex offender Jeffery Epstein and his connections to the Clinton family, as well as the sexting scandals involving former Congressman Anthony Weiner, whose wife, Huma Abedin, is Hillary Clinton's longtime aide.

Pizzagate also ties in with the case of former Republican House speaker Dennis Hastert, an admitted sex offender who a judge once called ""a serial child molester.""

Even President-elect Donald Trump's designated National Security adviser, the controversial former General Michael Flynn, tweeted about the connection between Epstein, Weiner and Clinton in November.

1072,"A “feeling as though the world is going to end.” That could describe what millions of people could have experienced in the last 100 years. World War I, World War II, the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Sept. 11, the ISIS rampage throughout the world, all not only understandably evoked fear of the world ending, but all revolved around madness, war and genocide.

But today that feeling is brought to liberals simply because their favorite lost an election. And strangely enough, it seems compounded with every good piece of news about the economy and the national security of the United States. Weird, no?

Today’s “feeling as though the world is going to end” is now a hallmark of those suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, a term meant to identify and mock people back from the edge of a mass hysteria assigning everything horrible in the history of humanity to a guy who was simply better and smarter at campaigning, and liked the American people more than his opponent.

Now the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in Canada alerts us to psychologists in the United States treating patients with what some in the field are terming “Trump Anxiety Disorder.” Yes, that would be TAD for short.

Forget about facing Soviet missiles 90 miles off the coast of Florida, or al Qaeda working to get its hands on a nuclear device. No, today’s distraught don’t like the man elected president of the United States and are subjected to various Obama and Clinton henchmen (and women) constantly telling them that there’s treason, racism and Nazis, oh my!

They have been goaded by a Democratic member of Congress to confront Trump supporters; a former Obama official compared border enforcement to the Holocaust; and we hear that people are going to die because of whatever the day’s Trump Armageddon happens to be.

“‘Trump Anxiety Disorder’ may not be an official diagnosis, but therapists know the symptoms,” the CBC tells us.

” ‘Is he gonna blow us all up?’ So inquired one of [a psychologist’s] patients recently, fretting out loud about the volatility of U.S. President Donald Trump’s actions during a therapy session at her Washington practice …,” continued the CBC report. The psychologist “refers to it as a ‘collective anxiety’ among patients who feel on edge about how potentially dire the president’s decisions could be. ‘There is a fear of the world ending,’ she said. ‘It’s very disorienting and constantly unsettling.’ “

In all fairness, Mr. Trump has blown up a lot. Like unemployment, which is now at historic lows. He also blew up ISIS. A few are scrambling around, but like the cockroaches they are, we’ll get the stragglers. He’s figuratively blowing up MS-13, the transnational terrorist gang also responsible for a nationwide sex trafficking ring.

Yet, the CBC reports, “In a 2017 essay for a book co-edited by psychiatrists from Harvard Medical School and the Yale School of Medicine, clinical psychologist Jennifer Panning of Evanston, Ill., called the condition ‘Trump Anxiety Disorder,’ distinguishing it from a generalized anxiety disorder because ‘symptoms were specific to the election of Trump and the resultant unpredictable sociopolitical climate,’ reported the network. “Though not an official diagnosis, the symptoms include feeling a loss of control and helplessness, and fretting about what’s happening in the country and spending excessive time on social media, she said.”

One clinical psychologist in the report noted it was the consumption of “media coverage” of the president that was making anxiety about the president worse.

There are so-called journalists and Democratic leadership in the news every day telling people that the sky is falling; that literally Armageddon is upon us; that Mr. Trump and most working with him are committing treason; that a foreign nation is in control of the country; and that ethnic cleansing is unfolding at the border.

All of these claims are as demonstrably unhinged as the lunatic “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that insisted Hillary Clinton and John Podesta were running a sex-trafficking pedophile ring from the basement of a pizza shop in Washington, D.C.

Here are the facts of the matter: Because of Mr. Trump’s policies, liberals like everyone else, have more money in their pocketbooks, are keeping more of the money they earn, are earning higher wages, are safer from domestic and international threats and have reason to be optimistic about the future.

We had 4.1 GDP growth in the second quarter of this year and the trade deficit dropped by more than $50 billion. This week consumer confidence was near an 18-year high. We have added 3.7 million new jobs since the election. We are in the midst of the longest positive job-growth streak in history. 95 percent of American manufacturers are optimistic about their company’s outlook, the highest level in history. More than 3.5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.

Certain psychologists and academics may want to assign a “disorder” to the those responding to the hysteria coming from Democratic party leadership and media, as though their anxiety-ridden reaction is beyond their control, and perhaps even Mr. Trump’s fault. It’s not. Unsurprisingly, many Democrats are tired of being misled, manipulated and abused by people like Rep. Maxine Waters, former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper and even Mrs. Clinton herself, and have decided to walk away from the party.

Liberal and leftist politicians want their own base to be depressed, afraid and paranoid about Mr. Trump. After all, when you’re consumed with conspiracy theories about Trumphitler, you don’t have any time to ask yourself about the disastrous failures of liberal leadership, and why Mr. Trump is making things exponentially better while Democrats made things worse.

1232,"Donald Trump has shared a tweet by a notorious far right conspiracy theorist who gained headlines for taking a “rape Melania” sign to a rally.

The US president retweeted a post by Jack Posobiec - a figure linked to the so-called “alt right” movement who is famed for promoting wholly erroneous and debunked conspiracy theories.

Mr Posobiec is best known for the Pizzagate conspiracy theory which falsely alleged a Washington pizzeria was the home of a child sex abuse ring that included people such as Hilary Clinton and her then campaign chief John Podesta. The baseless and spurious theory led to a man firing a gun at the pizza joint in 2016.

Mr Posobiec took a “rape Melania” sign to anti-Trump protest just after the 2016 presidential election in the attempt to paint such rallies as aggressive and belligerent, according to Buzzfeed News.

But this did not stop Mr Trump from sharing a tweet posted by Mr Posobiec, who has denied the charge he took such a sign to the rally, over the weekend.

“Dick Durbin called Trump racist for wanting to end chain migration. Here's a video of Dick Durbin calling for an end to chain migration,” Mr Posobiec said in the tweet that Mr Trump then chose to share.

The tweet claimed it linked to a video of Mr Durbin calling for an end to chain migration but the video actually showed the Democrat commenting that the DREAM act being extended would not result in “chain migration” - a term that refers to family immigration.

The section of the clip cut by Mr Posobiec shows Mr Durbin reading a description of the DREAM Act and its affect on family migration.

Mr Durbin, a senior Democrat senator from Illinois, was among the senators who attended a meeting with Mr Trump in which the president is said to have referred to Haiti, El Salvador and African nations as “shithole countries.”

Mr Durbin told reporters Mr Trump had made the remarks, saying: “I cannot believe that in the history of the White House, in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday”.

He added: “The President started tweeting this morning, denying that he used those words. It is not true. He said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly.”

Mr Trump eventually issued a denial on Twitter, insisting the language he used was ""tough"" but different to what was claimed.

Mr Posobiec, who started the viral #DumpStarWars hashtag in December 2016 after claiming Rogue One contained anti-Trump scenes, has also pushed a conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee was behind the murder of staffer Seth Rich. It has been proven to be completely false.

Mr Posobiec, who worked for far right Canada based site The Rebel Media for two months in 2017, has sparked criticism for his theories. Will Sommer, an editor at US political publication The Hill said Posobiec ""make[s] stuff up, relentlessly"" and claimed ""there's no one at that level.""

This is by no means the first time Mr Trump has stoked controversy for retweeting someone on the far right. Last November, the billionaire shared a series of islamophobic tweets from far-right extremist group Britain First, prompting outrage for disseminating its ""deplorable"" ideology to a global audience.

The video - which is fake - purported to show a Muslim man attacking a boy on crutches. The White House sought to defend Mr Trump at the time and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders insisted that regardless of whether the videos were real “the threats are real – no matter how you look at it”.

Mr Trump also shared a tweet by Mr Posobiec in the wake of a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville over the summer which saw anti-fascist activists clash with neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and farright supporters. Clashes turned deadly after a 20-year-old man, who officials say had Nazi sympathies, mowed his car into the crowd of peaceful anti-fascist demonstrators and killed a female civil rights activist.

Mr Posobiec had posted a link to a news story tallying those killed and injured in shootings in Chicago, adding: ""Meanwhile: 39 shootings in Chicago this weekend, 9 deaths. No national media outrage. Why is that?""

Mr Trump, who has frequently drawn attention to the issue of gun violence in Chicago in his Twitter tirades and speeches, shared the tweet penned by him.",mainstream,M17603,pizzagate
289,"MSNBC Analyst Claims ‘Conspiracies’ About FBI Text Messages Could Lead to Violence

“There are going to be consequences”

MSNBC political analyst Elise Jordan suggested that conspiracy theories about missing FBI text messages could lead to a violent massacre.

Remarking that Trump supporters pushing for the release of the missing text messages (which have since been found) “don’t realize the consequences… where this could end,” Jordan compared the issue to the 2016 PizzaGate controversy, which ended in a 28-year-old man walking into the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in Washington DC and firing three shots from an AR-15 rifle.

“You know, it seemed like fun and games for plenty of the conspiracy theorists who were saying that Hillary Clinton had a pedophilia ring in a D.C. pizza parlor until a guy showed up there with a machine gun,” Jordan said.

“And, the President’s rhetoric, the rhetoric that is endorsed by his followers — by his prominent followers on television — there are going to be consequences. And I think that it’s something that they should think about as they actively endorse it,” she added.

However, unlike PizzaGate, the FBI text messages are part of a national news story and a national debate, they are evidently not a conspiracy theory.

Jordan’s rhetoric is similar to her MSNBC colleague Joe Scarborough’s insistence that the text messages and discussion of a “secret society” within the FBI are “conspiracy theories” being “spread for political reasons,” despite the fact that FBI Agent Peter Strzok and FBI Attorney Lisa Page’s text messages directly mention a “secret society” within the FBI.

In addition, a separate whistleblower told Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) that this same “secret society” was holding meetings “off-site”.

Jordan’s absurd and hyperbolic suggestion that asking questions about corruption within the FBI and the Justice Department may lead to some kind of violent mass murder is obviously designed to shut down debate about the issue by declaring it to be a dangerous conspiracy theory when it clearly isn’t.

The irony is that while fearmongering about conspiracy theories, Jordan herself is spouting a ludicrous conspiracy theory.

721,"Want to know what the dark web looks like without even having to go there? A map released Tuesday by research and development outfit Hyperion Gray is bringing to life the often misunderstood and decried corner of the internet.

In what the company believes is an unprecedented effort to illuminate hidden services on the dark web, it allows anyone to zoom in and out of images containing the homepage of each website based on the Tor network. (Tor, run by the Tor Project, is designed to provide anonymity for its users and the hidden services within are considered to make up the largest section of the dark web.)

Be warned, though. The content within the Dark Web Map can be graphic. As Hyperion Gray's disclaimer notes: ""These sites include mature and/or offensive content, including pornography, violence and racism.""

The map shows 6,608 dark web sites crawled during January 2018. That includes all manner of webpages, from the amusing to the horrific. Amongst the myriad pages on the map, Forbes has already seen evidence of extreme sexual content, credit card cloning products, pictures of poop and penises, a large number of Bitcoin scams, Propublica's Tor website and a range of whistleblower pages based on the SecureDrop service. That includes Forbes' own SecureDrop service (feel free to drop us a tip securely anytime).

What's apparent from a cursory view of the map, zooming in and out of different areas, is that a significant proportion of mapped sites have been set up for illegal means, but there are also plenty of legal services such as whistleblower and personal pages. That's something Hyperion Gray CTO Alejandro Caceres (and co-founder with Amanda Towler) discovered too. ""I like Tor's narrative that the technology preserves political freedom, privacy, freedom of speech,"" he said.

""But the data clearly indicates that this is at the very least a double-edged sword. While we didn't put out this research to take a side on the debate about hidden services, it's not something that can be ignored either - there's a lot of shitty stuff out there.

""I should add that I use Tor daily for many reasons, and hidden services shouldn't be taken as the core of what the Tor project is and does."" Caceres also donates to the Tor Project.

The map was partly based on an experiment carried out with the MEMEX project at Darpa, the research arm of the Pentagon. As Forbes has previously reported, the aim of MEMEX was to create simple search engines for the dark web and had proven useful for cops investigating human trafficking.

But the digital cartography was entirely self-funded, explained Mark Haase, computer scientist at Hyperion Gray and the man behind the map. Haas started with a list of 60,000 Tor addresses, also known as onions because of their .onion extensions. He wrote a script that downloaded the home page for each and took a screenshot. About 6,600 sites responded, whilst the other 53,000 either timed out or returned errors. Haase then manually redacted any screenshots that appeared to contain illegal content, going by U.S. laws.

Users will note the clusters of different sites. They're bunched together thanks to a ""similarity algorithm"" that assigns each page a score between 0.0 and 1.0. That similarity is based on the structure of the website's code. ""The layout algorithm tries to put sites that are similar to each other close together on the map and tries to move dissimilar sites out of the way, which causes groups of similar pages to move towards each other and form into clusters,"" Haase explained to Forbes over encrypted chat. ""Two sites can be 'similar' in terms of HTML structure but contain totally different content.""

The map should provide a comprehensive view of the dark web, even if it doesn't give the entire picture. For instance, many .onion domains don't go to a webpage, but to file or chat servers. And some can be hidden, even from computer scientists who've contracted with the U.S. government. ""It's representative, but definitely not exhaustive,"" added Haase. ""If somebody really wants to hide an onion, it's very difficult for an outsider to find it.""

Haase hopes that there are two audiences for the Dark Web Map. ""First, novice users who only have a hazy idea of what 'dark web' means, maybe they can get a better sense for what it is - maybe not radically different from the open web that they already know - and a sense of what content is on it. Second, for expert users, we are planning a series of articles doing a deeper technical analysis and hopefully coming out with some novel observations about the structure of the dark web.""

""One thing i think that's interesting about this visualization is that it likely either confirms or challenges people's existing perceptions,"" Towler added. ""But the data itself doesn't have a motive. It just is what it is.""

Anyone who believes they’ve seen illegal content on the map, such as child exploitation material, should send an email to contact@hyperiongray.com with the details.

This isn't the first time Hyperion Gray has gone out looking for nasty things on the web. It previously created a search engine for sites with common vulnerabilities, dubbed PunkSpider, hoping to expose poor security across the internet.",mainstream,M0cb13,pizzagate
435,"This is bigger than anyone can imagine. We are in dark times and the transition of Trump being President has America ripping at the seams. Good vs Evil – Angels vs Demons! In multiple ways, as many of you know already without me even making a post about it. I have been laying low and away from the internet for AWHILE.. As many of you know. Im sorry to get up and leave the site, with only making sure our servers were secured. Things were getting strange and I felt a major part of me HAD to stay away for awhile. Preparing my self. We know lots of PSYOP’s are committed to further an agenda. There is an internal war inside major clubs, political organizations and other agencies. The common goal will not continue under the narrative has been going forward. Below is a compiled list of the major events that are a MAJOR CONSPIRACY in the MAKING?!?!?! Maybe, Maybe Not

As many of you know somehow Trump got elected. George Soros machines and the illegals weren’t enough to stop Trump from getting elected by the American’s who want a better America! Where we keep our factories here and hire American workers for a living wage and Rebuild out infrastructure. Look everyone can say what, lets just hope he isn’t part of the ‘plan’. As I would like to think he is the one who is creating the shaking of boot of some of these recent news events. Please make America Great Again. We will have to wait and see… Hopefully the recount/electoral college scandals will prevent her from Presidency. Apparently this method might not work as well.. Please keep your eyes and ears open for latest news until he gets sworn in.

This goes along with the latest leaks/news that has been breaking from Wikileaks dump of emails which relate to Podesta and Hillary Clinton and not to mention many other high ranking officials. Assange has not been seen from the Embassy window. Wikileaks is using a different or not even a PGP key with their communications. They are not safe, do not leak – you will be caught. Wikileaks denies they are compromised but I can’t tell for sure. That recent Assange interview was possibly recorded an an earlier date. Many also think they have replaced him with a double. But I also found a story about worldlawdirect.com being removed from the web due to a comment regarding a phone call claiming that the White House is scrubbing the story until after the inauguration. As we know most of the emails from the leak database eventually disappeared and or hidden extras were found then deleted. Many people still have the screenshots, Popup sometimes but the major social media outlets are in on the removal until a certain point in time. Many claim the weird Wikileaks tweets have a secret code to help him. We will have to wait and see… I have always said from bringing that Wikileaks could be a front.

Another possible planted story? A distraction? Well as many know this came out with the emails as well. The Spirit Cooking refers to “a sacrament in the religion of thelema which was founded by aleister crowley” and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood breast milk urine and sperm are used to create a “painting”. We know many celebrities, political officials and even Hillary her self have attended. We don’t know if this is 100% true but it was released in the Wikileaks emails. Also references to Moloch. Moloch, also spelled Molech, a Canaanite deity associated in biblical sources with the practice of child sacrifice. So we can assume that Satanic practices occur in inner circles.

Well Im sure we all have heard the story about PizzaGate and all the avenues that lead to complete mysterious information that has been protected and denied by major news outlets. The funny thing as I type that work PizzaGate it is correctly spelled. Look at that. Well first of all you know the major player in this conspiracy came from the Podesta emails. Don’t get me wrong, there was a lot of weird ‘Code Talk’ in the emails which correlates to a weird key that a user anonymously posted online. Not to mention logos which match the FBI Pedo logo guide. Coincidence? Think not because Besta Pizza changed that same logo to remove the ‘known’ symbol. Comet Pizza was a big player in this research because Soros, Hillary and many others either supported or visited the place. They have a creepy amount of kids in the place, with ‘hidden rooms’ and even a major refrigerator room and other weird art work. (Which has been taken down.) Not to mention, new staff after the news broke. Many idiots have tried going into the place for investigating and ruined it! I think they were plants. But there has been SO MUCH Information regarding Comet Pizza an the Owner. But he denies it all but hey there is no real solid evidence. Many reviews talk about the wings tasting off at his other restaurant, yelp has scrubbed some reviews. We also believe there is the Dupont Underground Tunnel Complex which connects most of these places. That is a whole other post about that! TwitterGate was also related the the Comet media disturbance to rid the net of these sickos. Which backfired. Look around for these logos and signs. Not to mention they hold weird parities in their basement. So don’t harass the business or owners at all. Just do research and then do something once something non-circumstantial. There will be a more detailed post in future, possible..

This is a breaking story. We are getting reports the day before this, they so happen to remove the traffic cameras at the intersections near Comet Ping Pong.. Hmm… More to come — –

This is the reason why I have finally decided to write a short post on some of this information that I haven been following secretly since it have hit the web on message boards. Saving and researching all the new leads that have been disappearing from the internet like every other hour. We have to pay close attention to this story and what happens. We know the media is already claiming this man was a nut conspiracy claiming they were abusing children and looking for tunnels. I mean, hey they did put it in there but the problem is they’re dismissing the possibility of it being true. Like I said I will update this when more research is done, instead of what the MSM has put out there for the moment.

We already know the new list the media has put out of Fake News Websites. Its funny how they can disinfo everyone who isn’t ‘awake’ so easily.. We this is the plan with the old narrative to further the NWO agenda. We know there will be certain ‘channels’ much like how your TV network plans are setup now. Different tiers of service which translates to certain channels. They will do the same with the internet and only verified sited will only exist. Completely monopoly of propaganda. So don’t put it past that these fake events will cause some type of legislation if the current White House has something to do with it or in the next 10 years. But its a baby step.

What will come next?

Not sure but I know all we do is hope and be prepared to think rationally by investigating and not jumping to conclusions and not do ‘investigating’ on open discussion forums for time to cover the tracks. As we know many have deleted their instagrams, Facebooks and Twitters due to the nature of the account and getting too much attention. There was also a twitter user who exposed hundreds of accounts but instead his account got removed?!? Websites have gone offline, business logos changed and much more! I might start posting more but I do have a lack of energy and honestly little hesitant to get into the rabbit hole of dark secrets… Make sure I stay safe, so does everyone else. The news will pour out eventually, its only if we believe it or not.",conspiracy,C06225,pizzagate
1306,"In his T-shirt, skinny jeans and sharply styled haircut, Martin Sellner is the European far right's newest poster boy. The group he leads in Austria has attracted huge publicity. However, Sellner's insistence that his movement is non-racist and non-violent doesn't have everyone convinced.

In April 2016, hundreds of people sat inside the University of Vienna's theatre watching The Suppliants, a play performed by asylum-seekers from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. And then the stage invasion began.

Members of a far-right group called Generation Identity (GI) rushed in, unfurling a banner calling the audience hypocrites and throwing fake blood over some of them. The performers screamed, fearing they were under attack. There were scuffles as some in the audience began shouting ""Nazis raus"" or ""Nazis out"" and tried to eject the protesters.

Ima was one of the performers. She had fled Mosul in Iraq when it was taken over by the so-called Islamic State group. ""We came from the land of fear,"" she says. And now, in the darkness and confusion, she was scared again.

""We thought they were going to kill us. In my homeland it's just so much killing and dead people so that's what we believed.""

The young man who leads GI in Austria plays down the incident. ""I actually don't think people were really traumatised,"" he says. ""I don't know anybody who had a severe trauma or a medical condition.""

His name is Martin Sellner, and with his striking haircut, fashionable skinny jeans and thick-rimmed glasses, he looks like a typical style-conscious 29-year-old. Like many others of his generation, he can normally be found staring into the lens of a mobile phone - but in Sellner's case, it's typically to deliver a monologue about the evils of multiculturalism and how Muslims want to take over Europe.

He is often joined in his videos on YouTube by his fiancee, Brittany Pettibone, an alt-right vlogger and conspiracy theorist. Her posts about a so-called ""white genocide"" and a paedophile ring connected to Hillary Clinton led the Anti-Defamation League to place her on its list of hate groups.

Earlier this year Sellner and Pettibone were both banned from entering the UK. The Home Office said that when ""the purpose of someone's visit to this country is to spread hatred, the Home Office can and will stop them entering Britain"".

Sellner isn't just GI's leader in Austria. He's also a poster boy for the Europe-wide Identitarian movement, which is fiercely opposed to Muslim migrants - claiming that they threaten Europe's identity and will eventually replace the indigenous populations. The movement began in France in 2012 and has expanded to nine countries including Germany, Italy and recently the UK. It doesn't have many members but gets publicity through confrontational and expensive stunts.

In the summer of 2017, GI raised over £150,000 through crowdfunding to charter a boat in the Mediterranean to target non-governmental organisations that patrol the sea to rescue migrants in peril. GI said it would arrest illegal migrants and sink their boats - its campaign received the backing of a neo-Nazi website, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and a leading American white supremacist.

It didn't quite go to plan, though. GI's boat was detained and the captain was arrested, accused of having illegal Sri Lankan refugees on board and false documents. They were all later released.

A few months later, GI paid for a red helicopter to land on the crisp white snow of the French Alps. Flanked by 100 activists from across Europe, a massive poster was laid out telling migrants to go home. This stunt cost more than £50,000.

But the organisation's actions in Austria have landed it in deep trouble.

The Austrian authorities think that actions like the protest at the University of Vienna theatre and Generation Identity's accompanying rhetoric amount to incitement of hatred against Muslims, foreigners and refugees. It's why they have taken the unprecedented step of charging GI with being a criminal group, rather than the non-governmental organisation it says it is.

The Austrian prosecutor compiled evidence from stunts GI carried out in the past two years. These included the targeting of a lecture at Klagenfurt University, a small campus set amidst the jagged mountains and cool lakes of Carinthia. Identitarians disrupted a talk on refugees and integration, unfurling a banner while a man with a megaphone barked at a shocked audience.

Enis Husic, a softly spoken student from Bosnia, challenged them that day. ""It was very tense and aggressive. I could really sense that,"" he says. ""At the time I wasn't scared but I was very scared afterwards once it was all over.""

The fresh-faced rector, Prof Oliver Vitouch, was looking out of his office window when he saw protesters and rushed to confront them. He was hit by one of them as they tried to escape. ""Although they usually say they're completely free of violence and completely peaceful, it's pretty clear to me that the readiness to violence is obviously there,"" he says.

For years, GI was dismissed by its critics as a bunch of wannabe hipster Nazis - but Natasha Strobl, an author and researcher, has long thought their actions and rhetoric pose a threat to the country.

""They paint refugees as invaders, as dangerous soldiers of Islam who come here to destroy Europe. It really destroys society,"" she says. As a result of this rhetoric, she adds, ""people get aggressive, people harass Muslim women on the streets"".

She wrote a book about the Identitarian movement and then began receiving threats. ""There are rape and murder threats when you open your email… I try not to go the same ways in the city because I don't want to be followed. So you change how you live."" Generation Identity says it's not racist or violent but articulating the views of many Austrians.

Martin Sellner grew up in an affluent suburb outside of Vienna. In his teenage years, Strobl says, he was drawn to the nationalist fringe in Austria. ""He was part of the neo-Nazi scene and the most well-known figure of the neo-Nazis, Gottfried Kussel, was his mentor,"" she says.

At the time Kussel had already been to prison for trying to revive Nazism. He was arrested again in 2011 and later jailed for nine years for continued far-right activity. It was after this, in 2012, that Martin Sellner set up the Identitarians in Austria.

We meet him inside their offices in a scrappy apartment in the centre of Vienna. It's fairly basic apart from a room full of cameras, laptops and lights where they make and edit their videos. Sellner is relaxed and confident; the day before he had been acquitted, along with 16 other GI members and supporters, of belonging to a criminal organisation.

""I really think we were vindicated and I hope that this verdict will also have an effect beyond this case and beyond Austria in the rehabilitation of GI,"" he says, sipping from a glass of sparkling water.

The prosecutor is appealing against the acquittal and is investigating GI's finances.

GI likes to stress it's not violent or racist, but what of Martin Sellner's past?

He admits he was involved with neo-Nazis when he was younger because, he says, ""there was no alternative. There was no right-wing patriotic movement"".

When asked bluntly: ""So you weren't a racist?"" his fluency falters.

When pressed further - ""Surely you'd know if you were a racist?"" - he still sounds a little unsure. ""I wouldn't say I was. It was a very ambiguous thing. I would say I was like a conservative, patriot.""

Earlier this year, before he was banned from the UK, he was secretly filmed by undercover reporters during a trip to London. He was captured using a racist and offensive term. He says it was a genuine mistake. ""I really thought that 'Paki' was a completely normal term. If I would have known it, that it was considered a racial slur, I would have definitely not used it.""

""Come off it,"" we tell him. ""You come to the UK a lot - the idea you wouldn't know it was offensive isn't believable.""

He once again insists he didn't know and apologises. ""If I insulted anybody with this word, I absolutely say sorry and I will never use it again.""

GI's actions often target events which promote integration - because, he says, he doesn't believe in this. The Muslims who come to Europe must do more, he says - they must assimilate.

""Assimilation means that you completely identify with the country, the nation, its history,"" he says - otherwise, he warns, ""it's treason, because you're betraying this community… because this community is giving you open hands, taking you in and then you have to put the interests of this community in front of your own.""

Standing in his way are anti-fascist campaigners like Jerome Trebing.

Publicly, Sellner's group says it is not violent or racist. But Trebing has worked with activists who have gone into meetings GI holds in isolated rural areas.

As he sips sweet tea in a Turkish cafe in Vienna's multicultural 10th district, a place that GI abhors, Trebing says: ""There is some really hard stuff going on. There are people who are allowed to say racist stuff, anti-Semitic stuff and there is no-one who is saying there is no place for it here.""

According to Trebing, in these meetings GI supporters said it wasn't just Muslims who wanted to replace the local population, but Jews too.

The saga of 'Pizzagate': The fake story that shows how conspiracy theories spread

Who's behind the fighting at US universities?

GI's leader denies it has any bias against the Jewish population. He wants to expand the Identitarian movement to other European nations. In Austria, he says, ""We have a right-wing government. And we want to push for that everywhere in Europe, we really want to change public discourse.""

Sellner's ban on visiting the UK has made it harder for him to spread his message to potential supporters, but online he is still very active - although he has been banned from Facebook.

In mainland Europe he is free to lead GI's continued aggressive, provocative targeting of Muslims.

Besima is one of those who have been on the receiving end of GI activity.

Sitting in her faded apartment drinking sweet tea with freshly made lamb koftas, she describes how she was performing with other asylum seekers at the University theatre in Vienna when GI stormed in.

Her son Mohammed was on stage with her too and she said the experience had traumatised him. ""He has refused to go out, he is still at home, saying 'If I go out something bad will happen to me.'""

Mohammed had been kidnapped in Iraq, which is one of the reasons she originally fled Basra with her three children. When she arrived two years ago she felt welcomed and accepted but feels the atmosphere towards migrants is changing.

""I thought I found happiness and peace here,"" she says, ""but I feel it's not safe any more.""

316,"The man accused of setting the 18,000-acre Holy fire in Orange County that prompted thousands of residents to evacuate their homes this week made his initial court appearance Friday.

Forrest Gordon Clark, 51, made several outbursts during the hearing in Santa Ana, calling the charges against him a “lie,’” and insisting again that he was being threatened, according to City News Service.

When a court commissioner ordered his bail to remain at $1 million, Clark said he could easily afford it. His arraignment was postponed until Aug. 17.

Clark, who has been charged with multiple counts of arson in connection with the Holy fire, was originally scheduled to appear in court Thursday but refused to leave his jail cell, according to Carrie Braun, public information officer for the Orange County Sheriff’s Department.

Clark gave a rambling interview to a television reporter earlier this week, claiming to know nothing about how the fire started.

His Facebook page is littered with links to popular conspiracy theories involving the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, a mass shooting that left dozens dead in Las Vegas last year and “QAnon,” whose followers believe a secretive government source nicknamed “Q” has been leaking information that proves President Trump’s election was part of a broader effort to take down an international criminal cabal involving Hillary Clinton and others.

The movement, a cousin of the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that also made bizarre claims about prominent figures engaging in pedophilia, gained media attention in recent weeks after Trump supporters were seen holding “Q” signs at some of the president’s recent rallies.

In postings published in mid-July, Clark also complained about a neighbor in Trabuco Canyon who he accused of using drugs and inviting gang members into the neighborhood. Clark also accused the man of stealing something from his cabin, according to the post.

After reviewing Clark’s social media posts, Brian Levin, director of the Cal State San Bernardino Center on Hate and Extremism, said Clark appeared to be an “anti-government, anti-establishment conspiracy theorist.”

He expressed specific concerns about Clark’s adherence to conspiracies involving land use. The Cleveland National Forest is federal land, and cabins located in the area where Clark lived and the fire started are not supposed to be used as full-time residences.

The Holy fire started Monday near Trabuco Canyon and has grown over the last week to 18,137 acres.

More than 20,000 people have been placed under mandatory evacuations with several more under an evacuation warning. At least 12 structures have been destroyed. The fire is at 5% containment.",mainstream,M18e54,pizzagate
610,"Her earliest encounter with the entertainment world would certainly raise concern by 2014 standards. Temple got her start at age three acting in “Baby Burlesks,” which today's New York Times describes as ""a series of sexually suggestive one-reel shorts in which children played all the roles."" When kids on set misbehaved, they were sent to a black sound booth where they'd sit on a block of ice. “So far as I can tell, the black box did no lasting damage to my psyche,” she would later write.

In the years after those shorts, she would rise to international fame in films like Little Miss Marker, Heidi, and The Little Princess. She was beloved, but not everyone felt comfortable with the way Hollywood capitalized on her youth. Graham Greene would flee the country after a libel suit followed his critical review of Wee Willie Winkie:

The owners of a child star are like leaseholders--their property diminishes in value every year. Time's chariot is at their back; before them acres of anonymity. Miss Shirley Temple's case, though, has a peculiar interest: infancy is her disguise, her appeal is more secret and more adult. [...] Her admirers--middle-aged men and clergymen--respond to her dubious coquetry, to the sight of her well-shaped and desirable little body, packed with enormous vitality, only because the safety curtain of story and dialogue drops between their intelligence and their desire.

Of course in the years since, similar complaints have arisen from pop culture's treatment of child stars, though that treatment these days comes in the more overtly provocative form of magazine photo shoots and racy film scenes.

But stardom threatened Temple in other ways. In 1939, a woman who thought Temple had stolen her daughter's soul tried to assassinate her during a radio performance. ""The tale seemed understandable to me,” Temple wrote of the incident in Child Star. As Matt Weinstock pointed out last year for The New Yorker, that's a shockingly level-headed response in the annals of celebrity brushes with the deranged: ""In 1981, Jodie Foster would respond to the Hinckley incident by sinking into depression, demanding to read all her hate mail, and ironically hanging an enormous photo of Reagan getting shot in her kitchen.""

At 12 years old, Temple had already started to age out of commercial viability. After the box-office failure of one movie in 1940, Fox dropped her contract. Eight months later, MGM signed her, but the movies she'd make with them were not hits. And there were other indignities: ""On her first visit to MGM, Mrs. Black wrote in her autobiography, the producer Arthur Freed unzipped his trousers and exposed himself to her,"" reports the Times. ""Being innocent of male anatomy, she responded by giggling, and he threw her out of his office.""

She also faced the still-common pitfalls of being managed by one's parents. As Weinstock put it, ""her father hemorrhaged all but eighty-nine thousand dollars of her fortune, but Temple describes his financial ineptitude with total dispassion. ('For reasons some may find inexplicable,' she writes, almost apologetically, “I felt neither disappointment nor anger.')""",mainstream,M128ef,pizzagate
233,"f you have ever watched the John Hughes Christmas classic, , and wondered how the family could leave poor little Kevin home alone to defend the house from burglars while celebrating the saddest Christmas ever, a Reddit thread may have the answer.

In the film, eight-year old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) was sent to his attic bedroom for being naughty. At first watch (or even fifth) it appears that the McCallister family wakes up late for the airport, rushes out the door to catch their plane to Paris, and in the hubbub somehow everyone, including his own parents, don’t realize that Kevin has been left behind. However, a clip of the film popped up on the Movie Details thread on Reddit, and is leading some fans to speculate that the true culprit behind the blunder was Kevin’s own father.

In the clip, the family is eating pizza and when some soda is spilled, Mr. McCallister helps clean up. However, he doesn’t just clean up the pizza and plates and napkins, but manages to throw Kevin’s plane ticket into the trash, too. It’s a shocking blunder, not just because a plane ticket ended up in the trash, but also because of the fact that they were eating pizza over their airplane tickets (who thought that was a good idea?) and because Mr. McCallister, who is successful enough to be able to afford to fly his entire extended family to Paris for Christmas, can’t manage to keep plane tickets in order.

Some viewers are going so far as to suggest that chucking the plane ticket in the bin wasn’t a mistake though, and that Mr. McCallister threw it away to punish Kevin. “What if Peter hated Kevin just as much as Frank did, only he was better at hiding it?” wrote one suspicious mind on Reddit. Watch the clip and decide for yourself: innocent mistake or ingenious punishment? Either way, it’s poor travel planning.

1142,"US Army intelligence officer Major Ed Dames was one of five officers trained to monitor and analyze ‘remote viewing’, a technique said to allow users to psychically ‘see’ locations, events or other information from great distances. 

 The top-secret project, run by the Defense Intelligence Agency, would be dubbed Project StarGate.

 The Central Intelligence Agency, to whom Project StarGate was transferred in 1995, canceled it, and declassified files related to some of its aspects in a massive document dump earlier this year.

 The agency concluded that the program had no hope of being used for operations, although a retrospective evaluation conducted following its closure suggested that there was some evidence of psychic functioning.

 In an exclusive interview with Sputnik, Retired Major Ed Dames, one of a handful of Army personnel to receive training in remote viewing, and who would go on to coordinate and run remote viewing teams, revealed that the technology was not only real, but that it was successfully used in operations against the US’s Soviet adversaries, as well as other actors. Assigned to the remote viewing unit in January 1986, Dames worked for the program until December 1989.

291,"WASHINGTON -- A man who walked into a Washington pizzeria with an assault rifle to investigate internet rumors dubbed ""pizzagate"" recorded a message on his drive from North Carolina telling his daughters the world is corrupt and he's standing up for children like them.

The recording from Edgar Maddison Welch's cellphone was obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press ahead of his sentencing set for June 22.

In the 2 ½ minute recording, Welch speaks to a dashboard-mounted camera as he drives with one hand on the steering wheel along a tree-lined highway, telling his ""girls"" that he loves them ""more than anything in this world.""
• None Commentary: #Pizzagate and the broader problem of ""fake news"" 



""I can't let you grow up in a world that's so corrupt by evil without at least standing up for you, for other children just like you,"" he said. He tells them he wants to protect people who can't protect themselves.

Welch, who is from Salisbury, North Carolina, pleaded guilty in March to interstate transportation of a firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon. Prosecutors will drop a third charge, possessing a firearm during a crime of violence, which had carried a mandatory minimum prison term of five years.

As part of his guilty plea Welch has acknowledged entering the Comet Ping Pong restaurant Dec. 4 with an AR-15 assault rifle and a revolver. He also acknowledged driving to the restaurant from North Carolina to investigate a conspiracy theory about Democrats harboring child sex slaves there. Patrons fled when they saw Welch enter the restaurant, and when he encountered a locked storage closet he fired multiple times. No one was injured.

Prosecutors, who are calling for Welch to spend 4 ½ years in prison, said in court documents that the video shows Welch ""was lucid, deadly serious, and very aware that his planned confrontation would likely leave him dead or in jail.""

Welch's attorney Dani Jahn, argued that he should be sentenced to 1 ½ years in prison. She wrote that Welch, who previously worked as an emergency medical technician and volunteered in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, is an involved parent to his 7-year-old stepdaughter and 4-year-old daughter.

In his 1-page, handwritten letter filed with the court Tuesday but dated June 2, Welch wrote that he ""came to D.C. with the intent of helping people I believed were in dire need of assistance, and to bring an end to a corruption that I truly felt was harming innocent lives."" He wrote that he wanted to apologize and that he acted without considering the repercussions of his actions or the possible harm.

339,"800,000 children a year in the United States go missing, many of them being sexually trafficked through pedophilia networks where the children suffer unimaginable horrors such as Satanic ritual abuse.

This number is comprised of documented cases of children gone missing, and does not include children who are born and bred into pedophilia networks and have no birth certificates, or undocumented immigrant children who come across the borders.

Worldwide, the number is close to 8 million children missing and being sexually trafficked.

Such is the scope of the problem that was reported earlier this year (2018) in Westminster, London by The International Tribunal for Natural Justice (ITNJ), as the court convened over a 3-day period to launch their Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Human Trafficking and Child Sex Abuse.

The Judicial Commission is comprised of world leaders who have been involved in fighting child sex trafficking for years, and includes intelligence officers, politicians, legal scholars, and many others. (Website: https://commission.itnj.org)

The International Tribunal was formed because most of the world’s government bodies today have been corrupted and no longer represent the people, but instead serve the interest of private corporations, and as such, justice is seldom found in most government judicial courts around the world today to stop such a heinous crime as child sex trafficking.

In fact, the child sex trafficking network today is actually facilitated by the rich and powerful, whose influence reaches into the political and judicial branches of society.

Included in the court proceedings of the first Judicial Commission of the Tribunal were powerful testimonies from victims who suffered unimaginable horrors as children being sexually abused and trafficked through this powerful world-wide pedophilia network that sexually trafficks children, a human trafficking network that brings in more revenue than the trafficking of weapons and drugs.

During the opening Plenary Session, Chief Counsel Robert David Steele, a former CIA officer, gave perhaps the best summary of the purpose of Tribunal’s Judicial Commission, which has been condensed into a 15 minute video:

As a parent and as a patriot I have been outraged for some time by the clear and present danger to society of pedopredation (pedophilia or paedophilia). I recognize now that child torture, child murder, and child organ harvesting is an ‘accepted’ practice at the highest levels of government, the NGO and multinational corporate sector, as well as throughout academic institutions and civil society. This scourge persists because it is allowed to exist by the complicit authorities. As a former spy and pioneer for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) I have worked with INTERPOL, EUROPOL, Scotland Yard, the FBI, and the national intelligence and law enforcement services or their representatives from over 66 countries. What I have found, without exception, is that they are all staffed by good people trapped in bad systems – systems that are not allowed to properly address this scourge – the multi-generational crime against humanity known as pedophilia. Pedophilia – a ‘love for children’ – is not an accurate term. There is no love for children manifest in any aspect of child slavery, sexual abuse, torture, murder, or body harvesting. For this reason the inaugural seating of the Commission of Inquiry into Human Trafficking & Child Sex Abuse, at the behest of ITNJ Commissioner Carine Hutsebaut (a criminologist and psychotherapist) the term ‘Pedopredation,’ has been designated as a more appropriate term, along with the term ‘pedosexual,’ for that considerable sub-set abuses of children outside the Satanic ritual network. It is vital to note that many organizations that started out with the best of intentions – from the Boy Scouts to the day care centers to United Nations assistance and development groups to Oxfam as the most recent example – appear to have been infiltrated by pedopredators. By virtue of being in daily contact with the most vulnerable members of society, our children, many of the mandated organizations have, over time, attracted numerous pedopredators to their ranks, and been compromised by their lack of proper vetting processes, as well as also turning a deliberate blind eye to the transgressions of staff. This need not be so if governments were honest and counterintelligence were to be exercised. It appears to be a matter of policy at the highest levels of global leadership to turn a blind eye to pedopredation and pedosexuality. It appears that pedopredation – including the attendant torture and murder of infants to produce adrenalized blood via ritual Satanic abuse – is in some cases considered an elite ‘privilege’ whereupon these echelons are permitted to practice such perversity with impunity. There are two additional causes for alarm. First, there appears to be a deliberate campaign by the elite to infect local, state (province) and national police, prosecutors, and judges – from Australia to Zimbabwe – with a ‘taste’ for pedosexuality. It is used as both an initiation rite into the Deep State and Shadow Government, and as a basis for blackmail. Worse, we are now seeing two terrible trends: one toward abusing and murdering children before they learn to speak (they cannot bear witness); and the other, perhaps brought back by US forces from Afghanistan, the combination of war dogs and toddlers in a devastating combination of child rape and bestiality – dogs raping children for videos to be sold. Add to this the growing market in fetuses, the most prized being those delivered on the floor as part of a Satanic ritual, and one has an inkling of the greatest evil on the planet. Second, it has become clear from our early inquiries with ample documentation, that both the family courts and the insolvency courts are being used to strip children from families to convert the children into a commodity that can be sold for cash, and are also being used to strip assets from wealthy individuals who are not part of the Deep State network. Governments are complicit in child and asset stripping, which would not occur if registrars, lawyers (barristers), and judges were held accountable. False claims and documents abound, and in their tolerated existence, challenge the legitimacy of the government. ENOUGH! The purpose of the Commission is to do what has not been done before: to document the actual totality of missing children each year (preliminary estimates yet to be documented are eight million a year, or 22,000 a day); and also to document what happens to these children once they are ingested into the local to global pedopredation network of networks. The average lifespan of a child once in the pedopredation (pedophilia or paedophilia) system is estimated by some to be two years — those being groomed for ‘leadership’ roles that perpetuate pedosexuality at all levels live much longer.

Tribunal Censored by the Corporate “Mainstream” Media – Public Largely Unaware of the Child Sex Trafficking Problem

The first meeting of the Judicial Commission happened in Westminster, London on April 16-18th 2018.

Health Impact News stumbled upon the ITNJ website when investigative reporter John P. Thomas was researching material for his series of articles on pedophilia in the Roman Catholic Church. See:

The Catholic Church and Pedophilia: Trafficking Children as Sex Slaves

Even though this event happened many months ago, it apparently has not been reported on in the corporate “mainstream” media, as is to be expected, but the event apparently is not well-known to the alternative media either.

The work of the Tribunal and the Judicial Commission continues here at the end of 2018, and it is our hope that our readership and others in the alternative media will share this information far and wide exposing what is the most evil enterprise in the world today.

Chief Counsel Robert David Steele states that the Tribunal and Judicial Commission’s purpose is to educate the public, not to try or convict criminals (see video above):

This is a court of inquiry. It’s not an adversarial court, it’s a non-profit educational event. One of the most wonderful things that this court could achieve, now that we have had “pizzagate,” for example, which opened people’s minds, is we could achieve an opening of the public’s mind. Governments are letting us all down. And I absolutely agree with the Commissioner who brings forward the need to the sovereignty of “we the people.” Because governments have become not only bureaucratized, but they are now the servants of the deep state, of the banks. And while we are not a law enforcement commission, we can in fact turn information over to law enforcement. The center of gravity for taking down the deep state, pedophilia is both the induction glue, pedophilia is how the deep state recruits and controls people. It is also the Achilles heel of the deep state. I believe that once the public realizes that the government is not protecting their children, at a scale of vulnerability that we can articulate, then everything else about the government is called into question. So for me this is a truly righteous endeavor. I will end by saying that as much good as it might do to get the British angry, for me the center of gravity for change is the American public. Because if you can get the American public angry, we will stop supporting dictators overseas, and we will close all of our military bases overseas. I am on record as a former CIA operations officer saying that our thousand bases overseas are not there for national defense, they’re there to serve as lily pads for the smuggling of guns, gold, cash, drugs, and small children.

One of the most revealing and compelling testimonies given to the Commission was from former Scotland Yard Police detective Jon Wedger who specialized in child abuse investigations.

As a CID officer he discovered child sex trafficking networks reaching to highest levels of the police department, local government, and even the BBC, which led to an independent Police Complaints Commission delving into the depths of police involvement.

Attempts to silence him failed, even after he was threatened by his superiors that he would lose his job, his children, and his home if he did not shut up.

When asked by Chief Counsel Robert David Steele why he hadn’t been killed, he replied:

Watch the entire testimony in the video above.

One of the most amazing victim testimonies given at the Judicial Commission was that of former Dutch Banker Ronald Bernard, who suffered through horrible sexual abuse as a child, and then became an abuser himself while working his way up into the elite sections of the global banking industry.

Bernard claims that there are about 8000 to 8500 leaders in the banking industry that control most of the affairs of this world. He was on his way to becoming one of them, until they asked him to sacrifice a live baby.

His testimony, like other survivor testimonies, will disturb you.

When I searched other information regarding Bernard, I found news reports stating he had been killed in Florida for exposing some of the inner workings of the secret society called the “Illuminati.”

Yet here he is in 2018 giving testimony at the Tribunal’s Judicial Commission, no doubt at great risk to his life in bringing this information to the public.

Jay Parker grew up in a multi-generational family involved in the Illuminati secret society, dating back to the 1700s. As a child he was a victim of Satanic ritual abuse. His mother taught him that 12% of America is generational satanic.

His expertise today is in healing modalities, and overcoming what he describes as the Satanic brainwashing that happens during the first six years of life.

As an insider growing up in the Illuminati, he has much information to share about mind control and how the elite in the Illuminati control culture through the media, academia, the entertainment industry, etc.

He claims that this control over people’s minds is what allows 800,000 children to go missing each year in the U.S. and no one even bothers to question this.

However, Parker believes people are beginning to wake up to the truth.

The video of Kristy Allen’s testimony is probably the most-viewed video from the Westminster hearings.

Kristy was a victim of Satanic ritual sexual abuse as a child. But for much of her life, she did not remember it.

Her father was a member of the Mormon Church, and was recruited by the military. He himself was reportedly a victim of child abuse as well.

Kristy reveals how their family was affected by mind control through the MK Ultra program, which prevented her from remembering anything about the sexual abuse for years. Her and her siblings were allegedly chosen for covert military operations as children.

Kristy eventually began to remember some of her childhood memories where she was continually raped and abused, and is in the process of healing.

Watch her testimony in the video above.

Why is Health Impact News Publishing this Information?

I started Health Impact News in 2011 to share with the public truths I was learning about health that are routinely censored in the corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media.

My own spiritual awakening to the truth began in 1979 when I committed my life to Jesus Christ, and can be read here.

In 1998 my family and I moved to the Philippines for several years, and it was there that I researched the truth about fats and oils, seeing first-hand how healthy the older generation of Filipinos in the rural areas were when consuming such large amounts of saturated fat through coconut oil, which was virtually banned in the U.S. due to the Government’s nutritional policies which condemned (and still do!) saturated fats.

I quickly learned that powerful corporate forces controlled nutritional policies to promote the sale of certain foods and drugs worldwide where the U.S. dominated the world market.

As I began to publish the truth about coconut oil and how healthy it was, while at the same time starting to export a natural form of virgin coconut oil to the U.S. produced by traditional methods, the public began to wake up to the truth about the health benefits of coconut oil and the lies being published about saturated fats in general.

I was utilizing the power of the Internet, taking the truth directly to the public.

Little did I know at that time that I was bumping into a mutli-billion dollar drug industry selling cholesterol-lowering statin drugs that depended on this false nutritional philosophy that condemned saturated fats.

The FDA came after us for selling “unapproved drugs” as we were making health claims for coconut oil, publishing peer-reviewed studies and customer testimonials.

We spent considerable resources on legal advice to learn how to market our products without violating FDA laws, which necessitated that we keep all of the information about the health benefits of coconut oil and any other natural, non-patentable product we were selling, off of the websites where those products were sold.

This was the genesis of Health Impact News, which originally started out at CoconutOil.com where we publish the truth about coconut oil.

I began to publish much about the pharmaceutical industry and its collusion with the U.S. government, particularly on the vaccine topics, which today are our most-read topics, particularly the HPV Gardasil vaccine and the scandals surrounding it.

In 2014, we started MedicalKidnap.com, documenting how the government routinely takes children away from good homes and good parents for reasons other than true child abuse, and effectively trafficks those children through the current foster care system where the majority of them are abused and heavily drugged while under state care.

What we learned at the end of 2014 and into 2015 truly shocked us, and destroyed much of my belief in the concepts of freedom and liberty in the United States.

I still believe that the Constitution of the United States is perhaps one of the greatest documents ever written in the history of mankind, but the values of human rights that it represents are routinely ignored or violated every day across this country – and maybe always have been.

We began to investigate why so many children were being taken out of homes and put into foster care, and have documented those reasons at MedicalKidnap.com, along with scores of stories of terrible injustices done to children and parents.

One of the reasons that we knew was behind children being taken away from good parents, was the child sex-trafficking problem and the growing problem of pedophilia. (Read our stories on that subject here.)

Earlier this year as many U.S. State Attorney General offices began issuing indictments against pedophile Catholic priests and leaders in the Catholic church abusing children, we decided to give more exposure to this problem.

It was during this research that we came across The International Tribunal for Natural Justice and their Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Human Trafficking and Child Sex Abuse in London earlier this year.

If this topic disturbs you, good! It should.

The ITNJ has done the world a great service in exposing this, and we encourage you to share this information with as many people as you can.

Because the first step in solving this horrific problem of child sex abuse trafficking and ritualistic murders is acknowledging that this problem actually exists, and that the truth will NOT be found in the corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media.

800,000 children in U.S. go missing each year, and 8 million worldwide.

Now that you know the truth, you are either part of the problem in allowing it to continue, or you are part of the solution in exposing this to everyone you can, and risking the scorn you will have to endure as a “conspiracy theorist,” “idiot,” or whatever other name the brainwashed masses will call you for exposing this truth.

He called a little child and had him stand among them. And he said: “I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me. But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.”

 (Matthew 18:2-6) I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. Be on your guard against men; they will hand you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues. On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.

 (Matthew 10:16-22)

81,"Hillary Clinton issued a call to action against the “epidemic” of fake news in a rare public appearance since her unexpected loss to Donald Trump.

The Democratic presidential nominee warned that the proliferation of false news stories online can have “real world consequences”, alluding to an incident over the weekend in which a man opened fire at Comet Ping Pong after reading a false news story that purported the DC pizzeria was harboring children as part of a sex ring led by Clinton. No one was injured.

“This is not about politics or partisanship,” Clinton said, during a tribute to departing Senate minority leader Harry Reid. “Lives are at risk. Lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days to do their jobs, contribute to their communities.”

“It is a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly.”

Clinton was joined by Vice-president Joe Biden and congressional leaders of both parties to bid farewell to Reid, who leaves the chamber after 30 years in the Senate. When Clinton rose to speak, she received a standing ovation from the audience, which included lawmakers from both sides of the aisle.

The former secretary of state has maintained a low profile since the election, enjoying hikes in the woods near her home in Chappaqua, New York. A number of locals have posted photos online of Clinton spotted on a hike.

“This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol I hoped to be giving after the election,” she said. “But after a few weeks of taking selfies in the woods, I thought it would be a good idea to come out.”

Most of Clinton’s speech was about Reid, the taciturn senator from Nevada who helped deliver the votes needed to pass President Obama’s healthcare law.

“No matter how high he rose here in Washington, he never lost touch with the people and values he grew up with,” she said.

Biden, who delayed a trip to Canada where he was due to meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to attend the event, spoke after Clinton.

“Every time I hear a dial tone, I think of Harry,” the vice-president began with a laugh, and was not the only person to remark on Reid’s tendency to hang up abruptly. He finished on a serious note.

“I love you, pal,” Biden said. “I know that embarrasses you, but I do.”

When it was Reid’s turn to speak at the podium, he thanked each of the speakers and several Senate colleagues and staff members in attendance. He thanked Clinton for being a “statesman”, paused, and continued: “or should I say statesman-woman, or whatever.”

At the conclusion of the ceremony, a portrait of Reid, who served as Senate majority leader from 2007-2015, was unveiled.

As the guests dispersed, Clinton walked the rope line as she had done for the 18 months on the campaign trail. When she finally reached the exit, she turned into a corridor where a group of young men and women were waiting. At the sight of a purple suit the crowd began cheering, and several young women broke into sobs.

Clinton, flanked by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, who was her running mate, walked over to greet the crowd.

The Last American Vagabond has been covering this investigation since the beginning, and in no way feels that what has been uncovered, such as the excellent and open-minded work of Press For Truth, is in any way diminished by the propaganda campaign now surrounding the term “pizzagate.” With all the attempts to distract and derail the true focal point of what has become known as pizzagate or pedogate, it is now imperative to make two very important distinctions.

Now there are those out there who would balk at the term journalism, and claim that only one with a degree and an Ivy League education can be a real journalist. And to that, we simply say, then go read their work, and we wish you the best. Yet, sadly, we all know that person will not be kept truly informed, as the “real journalists” being referred to are part of a massive control mechanism that has risen up in place of what might once have been a multi-faceted network of able-minded investigators and researchers whose sole purpose was to find Truth, and bring it to the individual. Yet, as most are acutely aware, that is no longer the case, if ever it was. This is not to say that there aren’t those within this control mechanism still doing what they can to create positive change, yet it is not hyperbole today to say that the vast majority of mainstream media networks are controlled by both their corporate and political influences.

We, and many of whom we support as genuine in their intent, are simply average Americans who saw a societal need for honest reporting and genuine investigation, and chose to rise and fill that need. And for the many with such intentions, this came at great cost to both their daily lives and finances, as there is no real money in seeking truth; typically, quite the opposite. These groups are continually slandered by those either too distracted to acknowledge the true intentions of their outlets, or those too programmed to see the legitimacy of the content itself. With mainstream media no longer even feigning the desire to remain objective(yet they still make the hollow claim), their actions can not be misunderstood.

SECOND, THE TOPIC OF PEDOPHILIA BEING PREVALENT IN HIGH POSITIONS OF GOVERNMENTAL POWER.

That alone, is the only point of investigation that truly matters to any genuine investigator of this topic, and is one hundred percent verifiable by documented history. The distinction, between the familiar name of pizzagate and what it has now come to represent, and the actual reason this investigation was started, must now be made due to the relentless efforts of mainstream media to obfuscate what has actually been uncovered. Similar to the way it hides the criminal activities of the Clinton campaign, revealed by leaked emails, behind the alleged source of those emails. But the fact remains, that what was in those emails, and proven true, was wholly disregarded thanks to what was clearly a very successful propaganda campaign. And anyone who dared address the very real crimes revealed in those emails was a “conspiracy theorist” and should not be trusted.

This is currently underway in order to belittle and discredit this investigation by making it appear crazy. Again, that’s despite people such as Dennis Hastert, a life-long friend of the Podestas and ex-Speaker of the House, being sent to prison and called a serial pedophile by the sentencing judge, or the fact that multiple child sex rings have been busted in the last 6 months that include both police officers and politicians, and some of which were in the United States. Most recently, a Mayor in Kentucky was forced to call in the FBI due to such a high volume of officers being accused of ‘raping children.’ All this is made to seem like isolated events while anyone calling attention to the clear connections are deemed lunatics spouting hair-brained theories. This is the classic government go-to operation used to make a topic seem fake. One would think we would be awake to this by now, after so many topics once thought to be “crazy” are now being revealed as true.

The intention is to muddle the verifiable connections and incriminating information with the ever-growing catch-all beast that is now PizzaGate. It does not take a genius or historian to know that the government’s first move in trying to control anything is to infiltrate and lead it. As was seen in the Occupy movement, and many others, that were no doubt filled with genuine individuals, yet was led into irrelevance, from the top, by the FBI.

As this investigation moves forward we must be cognizant of the very real danger this potential infiltration may pose, and likely already does. We must stay focused on the true culprits and not on the surrounding distractions and created in-fighting that is designed to pit a movement against itself, thereby proving that the movement was never serious to begin with, hence, cannot be trusted. It is high time we forgo the name that never fully addressed the real issue to begin with, and choose to call this what it is: An institutional failure and coverup of one of the most well hid secrets in American history.

566,"An online conspiracy theory dubbed “pizzagate” ended Thursday with real-world consequences when a North Carolina man was sentenced to prison for arming himself with an assault rifle, traveling to the nation’s capital and firing his weapon inside a neighborhood pizza restaurant.

Edgar Maddison Welch’s “ill-conceived plot” last year did “actual damage to the lives of real people”, a judge said before sentencing him to four years in prison.

Judge Ketanji B Jackson said she had never seen a case like Welch’s, and she gave him a punishment on the upper end of guidelines, in part to send a message to others.

If Welch believed an internet conspiracy theory that children were being harmed at the restaurant, he should have notified law enforcement, not attempted to take the law into his own hands, the judge said during Thursday’s hearing in US district court in Washington.

Jackson said it was “sheer luck” that no one was physically injured when Welch entered Washington’s Comet Ping Pong restaurant on 4 December armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and a revolver. He was there just about a month after the election of Donald Trump to investigate unfounded internet rumors about prominent Democrats harboring child sex slaves at the restaurant.

As diners and staff fled, leaving half-eaten pizza and cups of soda, Welch went through the restaurant. At one point, he fired his AR-15 at a locked closet, but he discovered there were no children being held in the restaurant and surrendered peacefully.

Welch’s sentence was just below the 4 ½ years prosecutors sought and above the 1 ½ years Welch’s attorney asked for.

During the hearing, the 29-year-old Welch spoke briefly to apologize, saying he realized that his words “cannot undo or change what already happened”. In a letter filed with the court, he wrote that he was “truly sorry for endangering the safety of any and all bystanders who were present that day”, but he didn’t talk about the conspiracy theory that motivated him to act, saying just that he came to Washington “with the intent of helping people I believed were in dire need of assistance”.

On Thursday, he sat quietly in an orange jail jumpsuit throughout most of the hearing as his mother, father, sister and fiancée sat in the front of the courtroom.

Welch’s attorney, Dani Jahn, said that Welch’s actions were “reckless” and “misguided”, but she said Welch, a father and former emergency medical technician, had acted with the intent of defending children.

Welch, who is from Salisbury, North Carolina, pleaded guilty in March to interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition and assault with a dangerous weapon. Though the rumors he went to investigate were unfounded, they have upended the lives of those who worked in the restaurant.

The restaurant’s owner, James Alefantis, said in court that the “vicious web of lies” about his business had been traumatic for him and his staff. He still needs security there, he said, and has suffered both emotionally and financially. In letters to the judge and in court, employees described the terror of Welch’s actions, with some saying they have depression and nightmares and need trauma counseling.

But Alefantis also said he was hopeful.

“I am hopeful that those who provoke fear, traffic in lies and perpetuate conspiracy will awake to the tangible harms that result from their actions,” he said in court. “I am hopeful that one day reason will prevail before a shot rings out again in a place of warmth and love and communal gathering.”",mainstream,M0d938,pizzagate
240,"There was a time when the “Great Game” revolved around kings, queens, prime ministers and presidents using diplomats, armies, and spies, to accomplish their grand strategic objectives, with spies and lies being the darker side of the business.

Today there is a much darker side to affairs of state, one that involves Satan, sodomy, judges, and pedophilia that crosses over into torture, murder, as well as the harvesting of blood, bone marrow, and body parts from the most vulnerable among us, our children.

I am the Chief Counsel and a Commissioner for the treaty-mandated International Tribunal for Natural Justice, as recently endorsed in its humanitarian mission by senior Australian officials among many others. I am also a former spy recently recommended for the Nobel Peace Prize, and a widely-published author on the dark side of intelligence and governance.

As the Australian Prime Minister visits the United States of America (where he will be briefed on what we know about Deep State and Shadow Government corruption in his own country), I note with interest that a US judge was just dismissed in Florida – a judge known to be working for pedophiles and helping pedophiles cover up their crime – while another judge, the Presiding Justice for my Commission, Sir John Walsh of Brannagh, has been struck off and debarred (without due process and with at least five provable perjured affidavits) in Australia by Justice Anthony Besanko and Justice John Gilmour of Norfolk Island. I believe pedophilia – including murderous pedophilia – to be an issue in this case also.

For those who remain in denial about the pervasiveness and depth of child abuse, let me make just four observations:

First, I have been nurturing a book, free online, by West Point graduate and former US Army officer Joachim Hagopian, entitled Pedophilia & Empire: Satan, Sodomy, and The Deep State. Pedophilia goes back centuries and is something with which Royal Families everywhere are most familiar. It is local, provincial, and national.

Second, pedophilia is both the glue that holds the Deep State and Shadow Government together, and the Achilles’ heel by which they will be brought down under the leadership of our President, Donald Trump, and our Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.

Third, PizzaGate, in which a Romanian taxi driver working with antiquated equipment successfully spoofed John Podesta into giving up his email password such that all of his stored emails moved into the public domain, is a signal event. It documented beyond doubt the degree to which pedophilia is the daily bread of the Clinton Family and the Democratic Party leaders, complementing all that we know about Republican Party pedophilia inclusive of former Speaker of the House Denise Hastert. One Romanian taxi driver was able to open the public’s mind in a manner not done by the book The Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse & Betrayal (elites in Nebraska) or the movie Spotlight (Roman Catholic elites in Boston) also in book form as BETRAYAL: The Crisis in the Catholic Church. President Donald Trump’s thousands of sealed indictments are in deep harmony the growing awareness and anger of the US public, an anger fed by one recent book in particular, EPIDEMIC: America’s Trade in Child Rape.

Fourth, the Catholic Church, while an easy target with ten percent of its priests abusing children and many of its Cardinals appearing to be both murderous pedophiles and all too willing to claim sanctimonious grounds for denying and covering up the crimes of the Church against humanity – crimes that include the sale of babies taken from unwed mothers to pedophiles and even Satanists who wish to feast on the new-born – is not the worst abuser. Schools, child care services, and international aid organizations such as Oxfam – are the worst abusers. Put simply, any organization that deals with children attracts pedophiles, and the networks, including judges and politicians filmed on video abusing and sometimes murdering children, all close ranks.

This brings me to the critical role of judges as an obstacle to public education and political integrity. There are three classes of judges in the dark world of pedophilia and child murder:

01 Those that issue restraining orders and arrest warrants against witnesses to prevent members of their local pedophile network from being investigated, indicted, convicted, and incarcerated – Judge Scott Dupont of Florida is a documented example.

02 Those that seek (generally without due process) to disbar lawyers and judges who strive to do their sacred duty in service to the public in this domain of pedophilia and child murder, what I consider to be the “last veil” of the Deep State and its servant Shadow Government. Anthony Besanko and John Gilmour – “carpetbaggers” (non-residents) appointed to assist in the unlawful seizure of Norfolk Island by Australia in 2016, appear to be such judges and merit federal investigation.

03 Those, like my Presiding Justice, Sir John Walsh of Brannagh, who act with unfailing integrity and have a record of confronting corruption (including, most tellingly, in relation to Norfolk Island). I am quite certain that Sir John would triumph in a fair trial, particularly if it included polygraph examinations for all concerned. I am asking William Binney, former Chief Technical Officer of the National Security Agency, and will be discussing what measures Sir John could pursue that would lead to a special data extraction – we have all the emails and cell calls of both Anthony Besanko and John Gilmour, how interesting would it be to make them all available to the Australian Prime Minister while he is here in the USA?

Ever since Saudi Arabia received a tailored extract from these signals databases, I have been sought out by opposition parties – Australia, Canada, and France particularly – and asked what they might do to ask President Donald Trump for the publication of incriminating signals collection on entrenched political leaders. My answer: ask Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State. I am proposing to Bill that we do a letter to the Secretary pointing out the diplomatic value of sorting all this incriminating material out country by country.

For myself, I have three speculative conclusions:

01 The signals data is going to be released eventually. Corrupt officials should begin planning their exit strategies now and strive to do no further harm. I continue to pursue a Truth & Reconciliation Strategy – it is better to educate the many than to hang the few.

02 The public is acutely aware now of what it means to be governed by a Shadow Government on behalf of the Deep State – 2018 may be the Year of the Independent, and I fully anticipate the rapid growth of earnest opposition parties such as the Independence Party in the United Kingdom and the Pirate Party everywhere else.

03 Sir John is being wronged by a Commonwealth country that is lacking a Bill of Rights and all too beholden to the Deep State. With or without his legal credentials from Australia, he is sure to become a world figure with his role as Chief Justice for the International Tribunal of Natural Justice. His vindication is certain.

Does Australia wish to be defined by two piss-ant alleged pedophile justices hiding in the weeds of Norfolk Island? Or might Australia wish to consider independence of mind and integrity of soul, and recognize Sir John Walsh of Brannagh as the gold standard for judicial integrity?

Here in the USA we have started the process of firing justices who protect pedophiles. I am most troubled by the reality that in Australia it appears there is a preference for the opposite course: firing justices who seek to expose pedophiles.",conspiracy,C0344a,pizzagate
730,"Cesc Fabregas has finally stepped forward and confirmed he was the man who threw pizza at Sir Alex Ferguson in 2004, putting to bed one of football's biggest mysteries.

The incident became one of the most widely talked about events in world football following Manchester United's 2-0 win over the Gunners.

Chaos descended in the players' tunnel with big stars such as Rio Ferdinand, Martin Keown and Sol Campbell all pushing, shoving and shouting at each other.

During the incident, a slice of pizza slapped Ferguson in the chops, stunning the entire tunnel. The United legend had to change his jacket for his post-match interview.

In his autobiography, Ashley Cole described the events: ""All eyes turned and all mouths gawped to see this pizza slip off that famous puce face and roll down his nice black suit.""

Ferguson later said: ""They say it was Cesc Fabregas who threw the pizza at me but, to this day, I have no idea who the culprit is.""

Martin Keown seemed to further confirm this, saying: ""As I said on the radio a few years ago, from what I understand it was a Spanish fella with great technique. Even when it came to the pizza he had great technique. He threw it like a Frisbee.""

For years it was speculated the Spaniard was behind Pizza-gate, and the 30-year-old finally put those rumours to bed on this Thursday's League of their Own episode.

Host James Corden asks Fabregas: ""Can we finally put the case of the flying pizza to bed once and for all? Were you the culprit that thew the pizza?""

""Yes"", replied Fabregas. ""Martin Keown is a liar because I saw him in front of me just, like, punching people so he didn't see anything.





 ""All of a sudden, I heard noises and I thought what's happening? So I go out with my slice of pizza and I saw Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, Martin Keown... everyone pushing each other.

""I was like I want to get in but I don't know how to and I threw, just threw it. Once I saw it was hitting, like, who it was hitting, which I didn't mean…""

Turning to the camera, Fabregas then makes a late apology: ""I apologise Sir Alex, really didn't mean to do that.""

The Chelsea midfielder also took part in a world record attempt with Jamie Redknapp during the show - trying to achieve 15 passes suspended 30 metres in the air.

579,"As I will document in this chapter, the third wave saw nativist populism firmly moving from the fringes to become normalized. Most of these parties had abandoned open xenophobia, rather dressing their messages within more acceptable rhetoric. In the UK for instance, the more toned down populist UK Independence Party was replacing the openly racist BNP, which I discussed in the previous chapter. Later, the Brexit Party took over the rollers for a while. In France, the National Rally (previously named the National Front) found renewed support under the leadership of the more composed-looking Marine Le Pen, who had replaced her more aggressive father Jean-Marie Le Pen.

One of the greatest successes of populist parties in the third wave came in the 2014 European Parliament elections. In Denmark, France and the UK populists surged to the very front. Five years later, populists entered the EP in even greater numbers. Prior to the 2019 elections, European far-right populists had attempted to forge a continental alliance under the leadership of Italy’s Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen in France. The US far-right strategist Steve Bannon was also trying to unite European populists in his Brussels-based group called The Movement. Bannon described Brussels as the beating heart of the globalist project, and said he wanted to ‘drive the stake through the vampire’ until the whole system started to disintegrate (qtd in Lewis 2018).

However, as I discussed in the Introduction to this book, it has proven difficult to unite nationalists across borders in a meaningful way, as each is primarily focused on domestic aspects. These parties have thus found difficulties in co-operating in the European Parliament and have, more or less, been split into at least three separate parliamentary groups. One of their dividing issues was that of Russia. While Salvini, Le Pen and Orbán aligned with Vladimir Putin, especially due to his opposition to both the US and the EU, others were more wary of Russia, for instance the Scandinavians and those in the Baltics, as well as also Kaczynski of Law and Justice in Poland.

Euroscepticism was also finding its way to Germany with the rise of Alternative for Germany, which secured significant support in the 2017 parliamentary elections. In the third wave, such sentiments were indeed spreading much further even in many of the more traditionally pro-EU countries than they had done in the two previous waves.

Populism was also on the rise in South America. The Chávismo regime in Venezuela had consolidated power, incarcerated leading opposition figures, and firmly forced much of media and civil society under their will. In 2017, Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, dissolved parliament and shifted authority over to the newly established Constituent Assembly, which adhered to the will of the Chávismo regime.

Over in Greece, different kinds of populists were competing for power. Landing more than a fourth of the vote in 2012, the left-wing populist Syriza was sweeping across the country. When coming into government three years later they for example had to rely on ANEL, a small xenophobic right-wing party. That was necessary for keeping the neo-Nazi, Golden Dawn, from power. Over the course of the Euro Crisis Syriza became more and more domesticated, gradually adhering to demands from EU creditors of implementing austerity.

Left-wing populists also rose up in Spain, where anti-austerity Podemos was contesting traditional politics, taking more than one-fifth of the vote in the 2015 election. The mainstream Popular Party, which had been formed in the wake of Franco’s death, was already highly nationalist. Nationalism in Spain also had a secessionist side, most notably in Catalonia and in the Basque country. Rough far-right movements had long found difficulty in breaking through, perhaps because of Spain’s relatively recent fascist history. However, in the second general election of 2019, far-right populist Vox party came in third place, winning 15 per cent of the vote, and landing fifty-two out of 350 seats in parliament.

This was also a period of many contradictions. While most of the nativist populist parties were in this period getting rid of their openly xenophobic symbolism, this era also saw several more militant and openly racist parties gaining support in many other European countries. In Bulgaria the Attack Party was growing and the Jobbik movement in Hungary was at the time still outright neo-Nazi.

With many of these parties finding increased acceptability in society, even discredited authoritarian leaders of the past were again being rhetorically resurrected. Jörg Haider of Austria, for instance, dismissed much of the discussion around Austria’s Nazi past, and leader of the Italian Lega, Matteo Salvini, openly voiced his admiration of Mussolini. In Russia, Vladimir Putin repeatedly moved to resurrect Stalin’s reputation. Notorious policies that for a long while were collectively dismissed—such as of religious and racial segregation—were also emerging to the surface again.

Most horrendous in this third wave were several violent acts committed by far-right extremists. Amongst these were the attacks by Norwegian terrorist Anders Behring Breivik in 2011, and Tomas Mair who murdered MP Jo Cox in the UK in 2016. In 2019, Muslims were targeted by a shooter in Christchurch in New Zealand, and another shooter turned on Latinos in the US border town of El Paso. All of these perpetrators were believers in the extremist-right conspiracy theory called The Great Replacement. This is the belief that Muslims or other groups of migrants are actively plotting in secret to conquer the West in a hostile, albeit incremental, takeover.

Instrumental for the rise of nativist populism in the third wave was also the simultaneous growth of social media, which provided for much faster distribution of both fake news and controversial populist views.",mainstream,M1c28b,pizzagate
744,"President-elect Donald Trump's transition team said in a Tuesday conference call with reporters that retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn's son is ""no longer involved"" in the Trump transition effort.

Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller said Flynn's son, Michael Flynn Jr., was helping his father with administrative and scheduling duties. The elder Flynn is Trump's incoming national security adviser.

It came a day after a firestorm over Flynn Jr.'s promotion of the ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theory, which baselessly alleged through fake news stories that a pedophilia ring involving high-level Democratic Party officials — including Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta — was operating out of a Washington pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong.

On Sunday, police say, the conspiracy theory led an armed man to come to the pizzeria. The 28-year-old man brought an assault rifle to the restaurant and was looking to investigate the story himself, according to police.

""Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story,"" Flynn Jr. posted to Twitter. ""The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many 'coincidences' tied to it.""

As of Monday, Flynn Jr. had a government transition email, CNN reported. Flynn himself also shared a similar conspiracy theory on Twitter days before the November election that claimed Clinton was involved in sex crimes with children. Politico on Tuesday found that the incoming national security adviser had shared dubious news stories at least 16 times from his Twitter account since August.

350,"How on earth did Donald Trump win the presidency when he lost the popular vote by such historic margins?



To put this in perspective: John Kerry lost the popular vote in 2004 by almost the same number of votes as Donald Trump 12 years later.

This is not a small question, to be noodled over by disgruntled Democrats and political scientists. It lies at the heart of the likely impeachment of Trump himself, and it will dominate at least the next two US elections.



The answer is fundamental to our democratic culture of fair elections, the rule of law, the role of technology and the free media.

Now there are any numbers of factors that could have swung 40,000 votes in three states – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – which created the catastrophic fluke of the Trump presidency in the electoral college.

But there are no factors as large and persistent as a weaponized Facebook – the trusted and entirely unregulated delivery vehicle for an astonishing amount of highly targeted disinformation.

Without Facebook, there would have been no Pizzagate, and the hacked DNC emails would have struggled to reach their intended audience. The strangely Russia-loving Green party would never have tallied enough votes to skew those three battleground states towards Trump.

All roads lead to Facebook and the small company that plundered its vast user data: Cambridge Analytica. Together the social network looks less like a group of friends and more like the Silk Road black market of arms and drugs dealers.

Thanks to the reporting of the Observer, the Guardian and Channel 4, we now know that Cambridge Analytica could happily arrange for a candidate to fall into a compromising scandal with a Ukraine prostitute or a bribery sting.

As the now-suspended CEO, Alexander Nix, put it so well: “It sounds a dreadful thing to say, but these are things that don’t necessarily need to be true as long as they’re believed.”

In his snooty British accent, Nix is only saying – and converting into highly effective digital marketing – what Trump has long believed: lies don’t matter as long as they’re believed.

So while it might seem grandiose for Nix to boast that he played a central role in getting Trump elected, he also identifies several key truths that Trump supporters may refuse to believe.

First, the use of posts from fake activist groups that blur the lines between a campaign and outside groups. “This stuff infiltrates the online community, but with no branding, so it’s unattributable, untrackable,” Nix helpfully explained to undercover reporters.

Election laws will surely change as a result of Nix’s bragging and Facebook’s arrogant and inept response to this snowballing scandal. Nobody could get away with such brazenly political manipulation in TV ads. Why should they do so on Facebook or any other part of the web?

Cambridge Analytica also says their data “informed all the strategy” of the Trump campaign, including use of the “Crooked Hillary” slur that Trump still deploys to this day.

At this point, lots of Trump supporters – and many political pundits – like to say that nobody could be this powerful. No single firm could have exerted this much influence.

But that ignores the simple premise that has taken Facebook to such epic heights until now: that we trust our friends as a source of information far more than we have trusted traditional media and other institutions.

The Trump campaign – aided and abetted by Russian hackers and trolls, conservative billionaires, and the brainiacs of firms like Cambridge Analytica – drove its disinformation through the people we like to trust: our friends.

The evil geniuses of Cambridge Analytica were, as Channel 4 has shown, not nearly the geniuses they thought they were. Seriously, guys: when your company is registered in Delaware, you should probably realize that you come under US jurisdiction.

Besides, we now know that many firms hoovered up Facebook’s data and the social media giant didn’t care.

The end is surely nigh for Cambridge Analytica, and its key executives and investors can expect subpoenas in the near future. If the Democrats win back the House this year, we can expect new laws to prevent unattributable, untrackable political ads on digital platforms in time for the election that will decide Trump’s fate.

But before we reach that point, Facebook’s future is already in serious doubt. It is now a polluted space, where you have no idea if your friends are real, if their posts are disinformation, if the ads are legal, and if your user data is safe. You may still trust your friends, but you won’t trust what they post on Facebook.

Advertising dollars will bleed away, removing the only thing Facebook really cares about. Developers will drift away because they won’t want to work for a polluted brand. And the regulators will start interfering with new product launches and new takeover targets.

If that sounds ridiculous, cast your mind back to the almighty position of Microsoft almost two decades ago, when it ruled most of the computer screens, documents and emails we stared at all day. When the justice department challenged its monopoly power, Bill Gates, his executives and his lawyers dug in with every denial and shred of outrage they could muster.

They lost their case but avoided the government’s attempts to break them up, after George W Bush “won” the disputed 2000 election. It didn’t much matter. Stripped of goodwill, with an eye on government regulation, Microsoft turned into the company it despised: IBM. Ubiquitous, boring and left behind. Only recently has Microsoft turned its reputation around, but it’s a far cry from its heyday in the late 1990s.

It was a remarkable coincidence that Gates himself turned to philanthropy at the same time, rebuilding his reputation on a global scale among people who needed his extraordinary wealth far more than he did.

All that has yet to play out for Mark Zuckerberg: the outraged denials, the public shaming, the polluted brand, the turn to philanthropy. Facebook is unlikely to collapse, but its decline has already begun.

He is only just discovering what everyone else learns when they come into Trump’s vortex, willingly or not. There is no escape when your reputation is circling the drain alongside him.",mainstream,M14ce4,pizzagate
220,"Microsoft is the company that funds Mark of the Beast digital identification company ID2020, and now they are promoting New Age witch Marina Abramovic who is best known for the satanic practice of spirit cooking. Is this really someone you would want to enter into holographic mixed reality with?

I suppose you can get away with just about anything if you call yourself a ‘performance artist’ instead of what you actually are, in this case we are talking about a High Priestess of modern-day Satanism, Marina Abramovic.

She is a wicked woman whose ‘performance art‘ usually revolves around snakes, pig’s blood, images of Baphomet, [pebtagrams] and all the rest of that garbage. But nothing to see her, people, Marina is just an ‘edgy performance artist’, that’s all. Yeah, right.

“And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.” 2 Chronicles 33:6 (KJB)

Take a look at an article published by the UCLA Center for European and Russian Studies back in 2018, where they calmly and rationally discussed the rise importance of witchcraft in Hollywood. It’s not simply enlightening, it’s a stunning eye-opener, and of course we see Marina Abramovic featured prominently in it.

“We seem to be living in bewitched times. Witches are everywhere, or rather: victims of alleged witch hunts pop up all over the place, preferable on Twitter or other social media outlets. Pop-stars perform as witches, like Katy Perry in her performance at the 2014 Grammy awards, where she appeared in a cowl before a crystal ball, while later dancing with broomsticks as poles.

“Beyoncé’s visual album “Lemonade” (2016) made several explicit references to black witchcraft rituals. Azealia Banks proclaimed on Twitter that she practiced “three years’ worth of brujería” (witchcraft) and tweeted, while cleaning the blood-smeared room used for her animal sacrifices, “Real witches do real things” (2016).

“Marina Abramovic’s performance piece “Spirit Cooking” (1996) was used in the infamous Pizzagate conspiracy theory of 2016 accusing Abramovic and the Hillary Clinton campaign of practicing witchcraft rituals and occult magic. Meanwhile, thousands of people coordinate binding spells against political leaders (#bindtrump) and Silvia Federici’s seminal book “Caliban and the Witch” moved from the bookshelf to the bedside table for many art professionals.” READ MORE

But do your own research, we have done ours and are satisfied that Marina Abramovic is exactly who we think she is, a New Age witch who hides behind performance art to promote Satanism, witchcraft, and all the rest of her demonic nonsense. So with that, let’s take a look at what Microsoft, the same company who is funding ID2020, is doing with Abramovic. Of course, me writing all these words are actually completely unnecessary, because when you watch the promotional video Microsoft has produced to promote her, it’s lights out and case closed.

Now if you have half a brain, after everything we present to you here, the last place you want to be is in a virtual world with a New Age witch known for satanism, gore and cannibalism. But this is where evil end times company Microsoft wants to take you, don’t go.

FROM MICROSOFT: Marina Abramovic is likely the most acclaimed performance artist living today. Known for risky performances that push the limits of human endurance, it’s difficult to overstate her importance within the art world and pop culture at large.

From the 1970s through to the present, she has created dozens of incredibly impactful works that explore themes of courage, ego, endurance, and spirituality. In 2010, her iconic work The Artist Is Present, was the biggest exhibition at New York City’s MoMA ever. In the piece, she sat still for eight hours, every day, for nearly three months, sustaining eye contact with whomever sat across from her.

“Any medium—visual, aural, even material—is really just a conduit for the energy of the artist to reach the understanding of the audience. In mixed reality we’ve achieved the first medium capable of presenting a recorded performance as an event happening now,” says Todd.

“The artist is forever, in this case, which changes the very nature of what the conduit means. But for the audience with The Life, it’s my hope that they never think about such things. Instead I want them to walk away feeling like they were just in the room with Marina.”

Marina’s most recent piece, The Life, further solidifies her unconventional and innovative approach to performance art—it’s her first artwork to harness mixed reality. Brought to life with the HoloLens 2, the 19-minute performance follows Abramović, whose phantom-like virtual image appears in a vibrant red dress as she explores the space and its borders. Viewers become mesmerized by her mindful movements, her virtual image dissolving as she interacts with the installation’s borders.

For the first time, viewers are able to experience performance art without boundaries—and without the artist technically being “present.” As soon as they don the HoloLens 2 headset, Abramović’s fully realized form takes shape before their eyes. READ MORE

1091,"Kimberly Guilfoyle had a jam-packed Fourth of July holiday in the nation's capital, joining new boyfriend Donald Trump Jr. for a barbecue at his dad's place.

She first headed to the Trump International Hotel however in Washington DC, where she was asked to pose for a photo with a fan.

That fan spoke with Guilfoyle for a few seconds and a photo was snapped while he was flashing the same white nationalist sign others have flashed in the past year, later claiming he was making a 'A-OK' gesture.

The controversy around that gesture began at the very same hotel on election night when it was flashed by admitted white supremacist Richard Spencer.

This photo was then shared to the Twitter account of its snapper, Pizzagate conspiracy theorist David Seaman.

This image led to outrage from many, which both Guilfoyle and Seaman were quick to play down.

'On my recent trip to Washington, D.C., for the Fourth of July hundreds of people asked for a photograph or selfie with me,' Guilfoyle said in a statement to DailyMail.com.

'I always oblige when possible, this doesn’t mean I know them personally or share their views.'

Seaman meanwhile fired back after one person insinuated the pair knew one another prior to taking the photo.

'Asked her for a photo as did many others at the hotel! Respect her show but don’t know her at all! YOU ARE FAKE NEWS,' wrote Seaman.

He also declared the Pizza is real.

Seaman later addressed the controversy in a video.

'It's very disturbing that these blue check marks are coming after me for taking a photo with Kim Guilfoyle. I am a fan of Kim Guilfoyle's, I'm allowed to take a f***ing selfie with her, if she wants to take a selfie,' said Seaman.

'If I just happen to run into her at a hotel as was the case. It's OK, blue checkmarks, you completely missed the point.'

He continued: 'This is not the white supremacist symbol its just the a-OK sign. You can find this emoji on any smart phone. It's sad, it's actually pathetic how sad the other side is.'

Seaman then launched into another theory, extolling his belief that Attorney General Sessions would seen be fired and replaced by a more 'ruthless' pick.

When you look at the game theory of the last 30 years, US Presidents have been doing things that are illogically harmful toward the American populace, as well as toward the world.

The trillions of dollars lost in the Middle East and millions of casualties in Iraq alone, and what do we have to show for it? Those were open-ended wars that never concluded in decisive victory, by design.

The financial crisis in 2008, and millions of foreclosed on families—that was a consolidation wave for these ‘ruling’ families. Legalized theft.

If you have a lot of money—I mean, more than anyone—and if you really hate the United States, yet you’re old and weak and mostly wear black and mumble incoherent nonsense because you’re high on walnut sauce (adrenochrome) half the time, then you don’t take us on militarily.

You do it gradually, through proxies.

You find compromised sickos like Obama, or the Bushes, or the Clintons—plenty of sickos in this world without values, I’ve learned through covering the Pizzagate scandal—and once you have them properly compromised enough (Bill Clinton flew on the Pedo Express to Lolita Island a documented 26 times; a US President went to a pedophile blackmail island run by a billionaire associate of the Rothschilds, not once, but 26 times).

When you look back through the Boystown scandal, which was hastily covered up by the pre-Internet age media with the force of a military air campaign, it is clear that the Bushes and many of their business associates are simply sick, deranged people.

For people who literally invented many of our modern fiat currencies, as the Rothschilds did, spending a couple hundred million (at most) on propping up a Clinton or Bush or anybody else is not unreasonable—it is practical.

The close working relationship between Lynn Forester de Rothschild and the Clintons revealed by Hillary Clinton’s WikiLeaks is precisely what they didn’t want the world to see.

Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, of the United States, when she was carrying out personal favors for Lynn Forester de Rothschild’s family on the world stage. Fact.

Why stop there? Why not buy up the media that covers these politicians?

So they have. The Economist is literally published by Lynn Forester de Rothschild and the Rothschild family, and it’s a leading voice against Trump economic nationalism, and American prosperity in general, in favor of “globalist” values….",conspiracy,C05e23,pizzagate
29,"Quentin Tarantino says he knew about instances of sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein for decades but failed to act in order to protect women, adding: “I knew enough to do more than I did.”

In an interview the director, who worked with Weinstein on some of his most successful films, including Pulp Fiction, said that he regretted not taking responsibility and assisting alleged victims of the producer, who is accused of sexually harassing and assaulting more than 50 women.

“There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip,” he said in the interview with the New York Times. “It wasn’t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things.

“I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard. If I had done the work I should have done then, I would have had to not work with him.”

Tarantino said that he had been aware of the settlement between Rose McGowan and Weinstein and that his then girlfriend Mira Sorvino had told him about an incident involving Weinstein making unwelcome advances and touching.

“I couldn’t believe he would do that so openly. I was like: ‘Really? Really?’ But the thing I thought then, at the time, was that he was particularly hung up on Mira,” said Tarantino. “I thought Harvey was hung up on her in this Svengali kind of way. Because he was infatuated with her, he horribly crossed the line.”

Weinstein distributed Tarantino’s films from his debut Reservoir Dogs to his most recent, The Hateful Eight, and the director said his attitude to the rumours was initially dismissive. “I chalked it up to a 50s-60s era image of a boss chasing a secretary around the desk,” he said. “As if that’s OK. That’s the egg on my face right now.”

On Thursday the Los Angeles police department announced it was opening an investigation into whether Weinstein raped an Italian model in 2013. The unnamed model claims the mogul bullied his way into her hotel room and raped her.

“The Los Angeles police department’s robbery homicide division has interviewed a potential sexual assault victim involving Harvey Weinstein which allegedly occurred in 2013,” an LAPD spokesman told the Los Angeles Times. “The case is under investigation.”

In an earlier statement to the New Yorker, Weinstein’s spokesperson Sallie Hofmeister said: “Mr Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but he unequivocally denies allegations of non-consensual sex.”

Earlier in the day, workers at the Weinstein Company released a statement to the New Yorker saying they had asked to be let out of their non-disclosure agreements in order to shed more light on the producer’s actions.

“We have nothing to hide, and are as angry and baffled as you are at how Harvey’s behavior could continue for so long,” it read. “We ask that the company let us out of our NDAs immediately – and do the same for all former Weinstein Company employees – so we may speak openly, and get to the origins of what happened here, and how.”

Tarantino’s comments follow the news that Weinstein’s prestigious fellowship from the British Film Institute – described as its “highest honour” – had been withdrawn. The BFI said “the serious and widespread allegations about Harvey Weinstein’s appalling conduct are in direct opposition to the BFI’s values.”",mainstream,M0e3a8,pizzagate

On Wednesday morning, at a fund-raiser at Cipriani on Forty-second Street, he was collecting money for his inauguration, and telling jokes about all the Republican establishment donors who were, at last, eagerly gathering around, writing checks to make the swearing-in flashy. (Cipriani’s Wall Street branch was the site of the fund-raiser where Hillary Clinton, inopportunely, referred to a “basket of deplorables”; something in the setting does not seem to summon up populism.) There will be more such gatherings; the inauguration has already raised more than fifty million dollars.

1195,"The influential publication The Economist released its traditional end of year edition where it predicts events of the coming year. The 2017 edition is presented in a very occult fashion: A tarot deck modified with cryptic symbols.

If you thought that 2016 was not a great year, well The Economist does not seem too optimistic about the year to come. Indeed, in its “The Year in 2017” cover, the publication predicts death and turmoil in a dark occult context, using tarot cards and cryptic symbolism.

When The Economist released The World in 2015 cover, I simply had to write an extensive article about it because it alluded, through symbolism, to various agendas of the elite. Indeed, The Economist is not your typical magazine, it is a ‘prestigious’ publication owned by powerful people. As I’ve written in the 2015 article:

While some images on that 2015 cover referred to obvious events, others were extremely cryptic – even ‘coded’ – as they were never satisfactorily explained.

This year’s edition is even more enigmatic. It uses the tarot to predict the year to come. Here it is.

The first thing one can say about this cover is that it is occult. The tarot is indeed said to contain within its symbolism the entirety of occult mysteries transmitted by secret societies. Also, considering that the cards of the Major Arcana are also referred to as “trumps”, it was a great way to emphasize that next year will be very influenced by Trump’s election.

Using tarot cards to predict the future, in a publication that is owned by the occult elite, is quite fitting. Through the centuries, several versions of the tarot were created. However, most of them contain the same symbolism which alludes to specific esoteric concepts. Occultists agree that the tarot originates from Ancient Egypt.

The tarot is an extremely dense compilation of occult concepts and symbolism, encompassing Freemasonry, numerology, the kabbalah, and alchemy.

The Economist’s cover was inspired by the Rider-Waite deck which was published in 1909. Here it is.

The Rider-Waite deck was conceived by the prominent occultist A.E. Waite who was an initiate and a master of several secret societies.

Therefore, by using the Rider-Waite deck to predict 2017, The Economist reveals the true force that makes these predictions happen: The occult elite.

Let’s look at the cryptic symbolism found on each card.

The first card of ‘planet Trump’ is The Tower. By doing so, the cover begins predictions on a rather grim note. Not unlike The Tower of the Rider-Waite deck, the card features a tower being destroyed by lightning from above, a reference to the Tower of Babel being destroyed by God. This card is usually associated with danger, crisis, destruction, and liberation.

On The Economist’s cover, the tower is surrounded by mobs of people holding a red communist flag and a crucifix. Why are communists and Christians facing each other while the tower is being destroyed? Is The Economist alluding to the two forces that are said to have propelled Trump to power – Russia and conservative Christianity?

Or does it maybe refer to the growing divide between two opposite groups – globalists/liberals/socialists versus nationalist/religious/conservatives?

On the tower’s door is nailed a piece of paper. This appears to be a reference to Martin Luther’s Ninety-five Theses.

A painting of Martin Luther nailing his Theses on the door of All Saints’ Church in Wittenberg.

Martin Luther’s thesis criticized various aspects of Catholicism, a gesture that prompted Protestant Reformation. Is The Economist predicting a difficult year for the Catholic Church?

Donald Trump is sitting on the globe while holding an orb and a scepter – objects referring to a monarchy. In other words, Trump is the king of the world. Monarchy and democracy are political systems that are extremely different. The Economist appears to be predicting that Trump will rule the world like a monarch.

Furthermore, why is this image associated the Judgement card? The Economist’s card looks nothing like the Judgement card from the Rider-Waite deck which depicts the Angel Gabriel on Judgement Day as described by the Book of Revelation.

The Book of Revelation mentions several times the term ‘kings of the Earth’. They are sometimes said to worship Christ and in other passages, they are said to worship the Beast.

When portrayed in a negative context, these ‘kings of the earth’ suffer the judgment symbolized in the seven seals, trumpets, and bowls, finally concluding with their defeat by the rider of the white horse in chapter 19. Strange fact: There’s a white horse on the cover.

Once again, The Economist’s The World card looks nothing like its Rider-Waite counterpart. In tarot, The World card represents an ending to a cycle of life, a pause in life before the next big cycle beginning with the fool. It is also associated with the concept of ‘unification’.

On The Economist’s version, we see images representing arts, literature, and theater floating above three monuments. Two of them feature classical architecture found in Rome, Greece, Washington DC and Paris (the monument in the middle resembles the Panthéon). The Egyptian pyramid brings to the card a mystical, esoteric dimension.

These three monuments perfectly represent the historical influence of the ‘occult elite’ on society. Claiming to be the guardians of the Mysteries originating from Ancient Egypt, passed down through secret societies such the Knights Templar, the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians and the Bavarian Illuminati, the elite has been the secret force behind profound cultural and political changes.

On The Economist’s card, lines connect these the three buildings of power with symbols representing popular culture. In other words, the occult elite produces a single and cohesive popular culture that is found throughout the world.

While The Hermit card in the Rider-Waite deck is rather simple, The Economist’s version is dense and full of turmoil. It depicts hordes of people marching while holding flags rejecting the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership), the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) and the EU (European Union). Other flags simply say ‘STOP’ and ‘NO’ which reflect general of globalization and the agenda surrounding it. Hermits live in seclusion of society and these people want to live in seclusion from the world order.

At the bottom right of the card is a cracked globe, another ominous symbol referring to profound division and destruction.

Silently overseeing the scene is the same hermit found on the Rider-Waite deck who holds a staff and a lantern. What does he represent? Here is the esoteric meaning of The Hermit.

The Hermit, therefore, represents the occult elite, the ‘secret organizations’ that have ruled the world for centuries and concealed occult knowledge from the profane (i.e. the masses). Is the hermit silently watching the masses getting excited about nationalism because it falls ultimately falls into a greater scheme? No matter what the case may be, the next card is not very optimistic.

This card cannot be more ominous. Not unlike the Rider-Waite version, the card features a skeleton sitting on a white horse. On The Economist’s version, a nuclear mushroom is in the background which probably alludes to tensions to come between nuclear powers around the world (a mushroom was also on the 2015 cover). Other calamities are found on the card such as mosquitoes (a reference to zika-type viruses?) and a dead fish in a dried up river (the growing water crisis around the world?).

Strange detail: The card features the same ‘blazing sun’ in the background found on The World card (with inverted colors).

This card is very similar to its Rider-Waite counterpart. In both cases, the magician has one hand towards the heavens and another towards the earth – a reference to the hermetic axiom “as above, so below”. In The Economist’s version, the magician is wearing a VR (virtual reality) helmet while working a 3D printer.

As Arthur C. Clark’s third law stipulates:

On this card, 3D printing appears to be a ‘magical’ solution to create low-cost housing solutions – an industry that is already ramping up. VR will undoubtedly be a big thing in 2017 as several products are set to be released in the coming years.

The infinity symbol found above the magician can refer to the limitless possibilities of both technologies: One can create infinite virtual worlds while the other can greatly expand the limits of material resources.

This card refers to the upcoming elections in three European nations: France, Germany and the Netherlands. Marine LePen, Angela Merkel, and Geert Wilders are attached to a spinning wheel next to election ballots.

In the Rider-Waite deck, the Wheel of Fortune card features an eight-spoked wheel – the Cycle of Necessity – an esoteric symbol referring to the cyclic nature of life.

The world of politics is also cyclic and, according to The Economist, a smiling Marine Le Pen is heading towards the top of the wheel while a pouting Merkel is upside down and heading down. To make things worse, Merkel is next to dark cloud while Le Pen is under a nice clear sky. Is Merkel heading towards a bitter defeat? Will her controversial “open door policy”, which allowed the entrance of over a million refugees in Germany in the past years, cause her to lose?

Conversely, will Le Pen profit from the nationalist momentum started by Brexit and the election of Trump? Will France become another powerful country ruled by the ‘far-right’ and nationalism? While Le Pen’s political party Le Front National used to be shunned and described as racist, it might gain political legitimacy in 2017.

Geert Wilders, who is another “far-right” candidate who is described by media as being “populist” and “racist”. Things are looking up for him as well.

While those who reject globalism might perceive this change in political scenery as a victory, the symbolism of this card appears to say: “It is all part of the plan”. Indeed, political parties, whether they be ‘far-right’ or ‘far-left’ are all part of the same ever-turning wheel, the “cycle of necessity” that puts into power whoever is necessary at that specific time. In other words, the momentum of nationalism might be planned by the elite to accomplish specific goals.

In tarot, The Star card represents joy, optimism, and feeling connected with the divine. In The Economist’s version, the faces of 15 young people appear inside yellow stars. I could not identify any of these faces. Some of them appear to be in their early teens.

Who are these specific young people? Will they be rising stars in 2017? Why is there a shooting star in the center? Strange card.

The tarot is known by all yet it conceals, in plain sight, a knowledge that has been hidden from the ‘profane’ for centuries. The Economist’s tarot cover accomplishes the same goal: It is published across the world yet its true meaning will only be fully understood by few.

The cover was heavily inspired by the tarot deck created by A.E Waite, a prominent occultist and founder of secret societies. By referring to this specific deck and by using its very hermetic symbolism, The Economist is pointing towards the true philosophy of those ruling the world.

Like the tarot, The World in 2017 predicts various trends to come while hiding, in symbolism, the true mechanisms at work. Indeed, several of these cards imply the existence of a ‘hidden hand’, an outside force that does not simply observe what is happening – it is silently guiding the world where it needs to go.",conspiracy,C01222,pizzagate; zika.virus

Recent arrest reports show that more than 1,500 sexual predators were busted for their involvement in child sex-trafficking rings in the United States since January 20, the day Donald Trump was inaugurated. A joint report by the Department of Justice and FBI reveals that for the entire year 2014, President Obama oversaw only 400 similar arrests.

Feb 18, 2017 – While the satanic powers within Deep State may have blown Pizzagate wide open for purposes of exerting even more power over their minions, perhaps the Highest Power is using the unprecedented revelations to save the child victims, as well as to shut down the global control mechanism (i.e. Pedogate) altogether.

Jan 21, 2017 – In 2016, the largest pedophile ring ever discovered was exposed by the FBI(source) coincidentally after Anthony Weiner’s laptop was seized. Mainstream media hardly spoke of it and in fact even covered it up. CNN would rather publish real news, such as Donald Trump eating KFC with a fork. We are here to do their jobs. Pizzagate is a joint investigation between citizens and law enforcement to expose child sex trafficking around the world.”

December 11, 2016 – Stephen Colbert dismisses Pizzagate as conspiracy theory gone wild in this excellent video presentation.

Dec 8, 2016 -TPTB simply will not permit such an investigation to take place, as it would mean the end of their primary control mechanism of the Global Control Matrix. The entire leadership of the World Shadow Government would end up exposed and in prison…for life, if not given capital punishment were the truth to be told. Hence, those righteous agents and middle managers in the FBI, who deign to reveal the PIZZAGATE facts to the public, do so on pain of death.

Dec 8, 2016 – Law enforcement authorities and online “Urban Dictionary” resources have identified the specific terms we just mentioned – pizza, cheese, sauce, pasta, et cetera – as code words for child sex trafficking. Code words allow people engaging in illegal activities to have a cover story in the event that their communications are discovered. A simple, much less serious example of code-speak would be a college student referring to a bag of weed as a “book”, such as when talking on the phone or in an email about it. People engaging in criminal activities have always been aware of surveillance, and use code terms to avoid getting caught, or at least reduce the risk.

Dec 3, 2016 – The following text is taken from an alleged Comet Ping Pong computer app instruction and marketing sheet screenshot discovered today by a youtuber. I have no way of knowing whether this is a hoax or not, but refer to his video below for more information about this sickening “App”. If it is not a hoax, four little girls died, and 5 are probably still retained for future torture.

Dec 3, 2016 – I’ve created this blog to share the information 4chan has collectively gathered and researched about a suspected pedophilia and human trafficking ring that we seem to have uncovered existing within our DC politicians and the elite class.

Dec 25, 2016 – The most critical point here is that Pizzagate is the lynchpin that is inextricably connected to all the other Pedogates. Because it represents the child exploitation operation in the nation’s capital and related power centers, its outing has the capacity to expose the whole bloody child abuse culture. Yes, Pizzagate is that prominently configured within the world-wide Pedogate scandal. It’s not the grand-daddy like the Brussels Pedogate, but it involves a Who’s Who of American society and especially the political class.

It’s nothing more than predatory pedophiles in high positions using code words for ordering a pizza to refer to wanting to engage a child in sex, and it looks like Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager’s brother was right in the middle of it, along with Thalemic Spirit Cooking advocate Marina Abromovic. Now, many web sites and social media are being censored for reporting on the subject.

PIZZAGATE: The Most Important VIDEO Transcript to Date

Nov 29, 2016 – James Comey: why did he call up Hillary’s investigation again? James wasn’t serious about Hillary’s case at all. The whole thing was a façade, a lie meant to distract from what really happened the night of November 6. All that ran across media headlines was that Hillary was exonerated from her email scandal again, that Anthony Wiener and Huma’s 650,000 emails revealed nothing substantial but as it turns out the whole story was a distraction.

Nov 29, 2016 – By now, the disturbing story of #Pizzagate and its ongoing investigation is spreading like wildfire. Unfortunately many have yet to catch wind of exactly what the most essential pieces to this story are, the most important characters, and the implications involved. As usual, mainstream media is either blackballing it entirely, or writing propagandized “hit pieces” on the matter, implying their attempt to slander the evidence and to sway others from looking deeper into it with an open mind.

PIZZAGATE: The Greatest Scandal of the Third Millennium

Nov 22, 2016 – For those who are uninitiated in the subterranean realm of organized pedophilia, child trafficking, and Satanic ritual child sexual abuse, it is critical that you do not stop reading here. For the nationwide scandal known as PIZZAGATE lies at the very nexus of the U.S. Federal Government and Hollywood. Because of this grim reality, the reader can no longer ignore the extraordinary import of this ongoing scourge occurring across America 24/7.

PIZZAGATE: It’s Much Worse Than You’ll Ever Know

Nov 18, 2016 – Posters over at 4Chan and Reddit have been conducting an extremely bizarre investigation following the John Podesta e-mail leak (Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman) and the results are surreal: They’ve apparently uncovered an elite child trafficking network which celebrates its tendencies using code words and disturbing artworks.

Nov 18, 2016 -Know the enemy. See it and wrench it out of the shadows, into the light. I just broke down into tears. After spending the last evening going over this material particularly as it pertains to the #Spiritcooking/#pizzagate/Comet Ping Pong connection. This looks like the face of the enemy. Why? It appears on its face to be nothing more than a hipster dive pizza shop run by the “49th most connected man in DC”, but somethings struck me as very odd.

Nov 18, 2016 – Bear in mind that John Podesta is not only the ultimate Democratic powerbroker, Beltway insider and powerful political fixer, his professional resume is both long and deep in the U.S. Federal Government. He was Bill Clinton’s White House Chief of Staff back in the 1990s, Barack Obama’s Counselor to the President, and Chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.

The Whore of Babylon: Deep Backstory of the Worldwide Pedophile Ring

November 18, 2016 – Patriots are waking up to a nightmare that is only being revealed by alternative media. We are no longer able to rely on the broadcast, cable, and print media to report the news accurately, much less any mention of the heinous crimes that seem to have been committed by Washington power-brokers, global elites, world-renowned charities, the Vatican—just to name a few. For this reason, Pizzagate, the popular moniker given to the first-ever citizen OPEN SOURCE INVESTIGATION of world-wide pedophilia and human trafficking, is getting huge support from citizen investigators using non-conventional media channels to reach their audiences.

Citizens use Social Media to Uncover Heinous Crimes. Where is Law Enforcement?

November 14, 2016 – PizzaGate has become a world-wide citizen investigation, using the power of social media and citizen vigilance, to uncover heinous crimes against children and unwilling adults that the elites and their co-opted partners use for perverted recreation, human trafficking, and satanic rituals. Using the power of internet searches, WikiLeaks, Reddit threads, videos, and actual first hand investigations, citizens are putting together evidence that LAW ENFORCEMENT needs to investigate and make publically known that they are “on it” so that we can back off and let the professionals do their job.

PIZZAGATE: The Scandal That Will Take Down the Clintons

Nov 12, 2016 -For those many citizen journalists who are in the know, Pizzagate was immediately recognized as the scandal that will literally take down the U.S. Federal Government, after it dissolves the Democratic Party. This epic and rapidly unfolding crime spree has all the elements to incriminate many leading politicians and D.C. power-brokers, well-known globalists and Beltway lobbyists. Truly, this is the scandal that the American people have been waiting for.

PIZZAGATE UNFOLDS: MSM Reporters Will Not Do Their Jobs so Citizen Reporters Must Expose the Crime of the Century

November 11, 2016 – Engaged citizen journalism around the world is going full force and the globalists and elites are getting nervous. We are uncovering hard circumstantial evidence that needs to be followed up by law enforcement authorities who have not, themselves, been corrupted by the pedophile blackmail that has engulfed our world. People, especially those who have been involved with the child pornography-sex scandal-satanic rituals blackmail and pizza parties need to start coming forward as humanity cannot make spiritual progress as long as these satanic forces lurk behind compromised politicians, government officials, church and community leaders, and, most especially, the elite who continue to rule and enslave We The People from their lofty thrones of power and money.

November 8, 2016 – Must see video that was one of the first posts that alerted the public of pedophilia and its special coded language of pizzas and hot dogs.

In case this isn’t enough evidence for law enforcement to aggressively go after the criminal cabal, listed below are additional sources that expose their heinous crimes against humaity:

432,"Recent editorials of statewide and national interest from Ohio newspapers:

Gov. Mike DeWine is asking Ohio lawmakers to consider abolishing the state’s statute of limitations for sexual assault. His inspiration is the revelation that the late Dr. Richard Strauss sexually abused nearly 180 male Ohio State University students between 1979 and 1998. Though it is a moot point for Strauss, who killed himself in 2005, DeWine said the current statute of limitations means that, were he alive, Strauss likely could not be prosecuted today.

And Strauss certainly is not the only monster committing such crimes in Ohio.

Right now, the statute of limitations for rape is 20-25 years, depending on the circumstances. Some other felony sex crimes must be prosecuted in as little as six years. Misdemeanor sex charges must be filed within two years, and civil lawsuits must be filed within 1-2 years.

Horrific as it may be, lawmakers must understand there are some victims who have not yet aged out of the guardianship of their abusers during that time frame. Others sometimes take years of counseling to gain the confidence to accuse their attackers.

DeWine has ordered a working group to study an unredacted version of an OSU report released last week to determine if the Ohio State Medical Board knew about Strauss’ abuse, and, then, whether the board did anything about it.

“We can use this tragedy as an opportunity to review Ohio’s current laws and to take steps to change the culture of how we respond to sexual abuse,” DeWine said.

Lawmakers should not play politics with this request. The only finger-pointing it should inspire is toward the perpetrators of these heinous crimes, to serve notice that no amount of time will save them from the consequences of their deeds.

In a refreshing display of bipartisanship, Sens. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) and Rand Paul (R., Ky.) are teaming up to restore due process for travelers moving through the U.S. border.

The senators’ Protecting Data at the Border Act would require border agents to either obtain a warrant or written consent to search the electronics of a person entering or exiting the United States.

There has been a precipitous rise in the number of electronic device searches in recent years. The 30,200 searches conducted in 2017 represented a 58.5 percent increase from the year prior. The number increased again in 2018, as Customs and Border Protection administered 33,000 searches.

What’s more, the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security found in 2018 that border agents frequently mishandled personal data acquired during these searches, failing to delete sensitive information from DHS servers. The OIG also found that 67 percent of these searches were documented incorrectly, containing insufficient or inaccurate information about how or why the search was conducted.

Previously, border agents did not need a warrant or probable cause to conduct these searches or acquire data.

The bill from Senators Wyden and Paul seeks to rectify this glaring oversight, hopefully restoring some measure of due process.

“The border is quickly becoming a rights-free zone for Americans who travel,” Mr. Wyden said in a statement. “The government shouldn’t be able to review your whole digital life simply because you went on vacation, or had to travel for work.”

The pair of senators introduced a similar bill in 2017, but it failed to gain much support.

That should change in 2019.

The Protecting Data at the Border Act provides common sense protections for people passing through the border, ensuring that civil liberties are protected and the Fourth Amendment is upheld. These are nonpartisan values that can and should be supported by people across the political spectrum.

But one thing this bill cannot fix is the sort of bureaucratic incompetency that the OIG identified within Homeland Security and the CBP. If Congress passes the legislation, it should also take care to exercise its oversight power to ensure that it is being enforced properly.

Few rights are as precious as those that protect citizens from unjust governmental intrusion. Congress must do its part to protect them.

Clevelanders are still celebrating the May 22 announcement that the city will host the 2021 NFL Draft. “It’s a big, big deal to our area,” said the Browns’ Jimmy Haslam, who worked with Dave Gilbert of the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission to bring the big-money, fan-favorite draft to town.

Haslam is right. It is a big, big deal. But it’s not the only big, big deal Gilbert has swung for this city since he took over the sports commission in 2000 (he added leadership of Destination Cleveland 11 years later).

Think RNC: Gilbert led the 2016 Cleveland host committee for the Republican National Convention that showcased Cleveland to the world. And coming up are the MLB All-Star Game July 9, the first and second rounds of the NCAA Men’s Basketball championships next year, the NBA All-Star Game in 2022 and the NCAA Women’s Final Four in 2024.

Adding the NFL Draft in 2021 makes the lineup even sweeter. And how many cities of Cleveland’s size can boast this recent cornucopia of major events?

If anyone doubts how hard Dave Gilbert personally has worked to make this all happen, let’s review:

2002 - U.S. gymnastics championships are held in Cleveland.

2009 - U.S. figure skating championships are held in Cleveland.

2014 - The Gay Games welcome participants from 50 nations and 48 U.S. states.

2016 - The Republican National Convention is held in Cleveland.

2018 - The NCAA Division 1 Wrestling Championships hit the mats in town.

The combined economic impact from all these events is in the hundreds of millions. (The Gay Games alone had a $51.3 million impact, according to the Cleveland Foundation. The RNC was estimated at a $142 million local impact by Cleveland State University scholars.)

Yet, as the RNC showed, the biggest value is in the boost to the town’s image and downtown vitality.

The NFL Draft will be no different, drawing fans decked out in their individual team colors from all over the country, along with extensive television coverage and ancillary events that will have a regional impact. Canton’s Pro Football Hall of Fame already is planning for a boost in attendance.

This year’s NFL Draft, in Nashville, set attendance records, with more than 600,000 fans attending, 47.5 million watching on television and more than $100 million in revenue.

Thank you, Dave Gilbert, for your stellar efforts. The real question for Cleveland may be: What are you working on next?

A bunch of white suprema- cists went to Dayton to foment hatred and, instead, were confronted by an overwhelming demonstration of love and camaraderie.

But the presence of members of the Indiana Ku Klux Klan in a major city in Ohio was a stark reminder of the rise of white nationalism across the United States.

As Keegan Hankes, a researcher for the Southern Poverty Law Center, told the Associated Press, the number of hate groups is growing, driven in part by a toxic political culture.

The human rights organization counted 784 active hate groups in the U.S. in 2014 and 1,020 in 2018.

Indeed, while Dayton residents sent a timely and clear message by drowning out the Kluxers and their ilk, Mayor Nan Whaley had an observation about her city that President Donald J. Trump should be conveying about the nation:

“Dayton is still too segregated and still too unequal. This is unacceptable, and something we must keep focused on to change every single day.”

The Dayton Daily News reported that 500 to 600 people showed up Saturday on Courthouse Square to protest the rally by the Indiana KKK.

The paper, which made note of the presence of more than 700 law enforcement personnel, quoted Shanta Parham, 39, of Dayton, as saying it was important to show pride and solidarity and to not respond with violence, hate or stupidity.

“This is my city, and I am going to stand up for it,” Parham said.

It’s the kind of message that needs to be delivered around the country as the racial divide widens.

Despite the insistence of the White House that President Trump has shown the proper leadership in tamping down the racist rhetoric, the fact remains that his comments after white supremacists rallied in August 2017 in Charlottsville have energized the KKK and others.

Although a counterprotester was killed when a car rammed into her and others, the president responded by claiming there were “very fine people on both sides.”

Trump has also fueled the white nationalist movement with his anti-immigration rhetoric and his claims that dangerous criminals are pouring into this country from the Southern Hemisphere.

Here are the opening paragraphs of the extensive story by the Associated Press about the increase in hate groups, especially in the West.

“Nearly two decades after the Aryan Nations’ Idaho compound was demolished, far-right extremists are maintaining a presence in the Pacific Northwest.

“White nationalism has been on the rise across the U.S., but it has particular resonance along the Idaho-Washington border, where the Aryans espoused hate and violence for years.”

What is most troubling is that such groups are finding allies in government and other public institutions.

For instance, in the county that houses Hayden Lake, Idaho, where Aryan Nations was based for decades, Republicans last month passed a measure that puts the Trump administration on the spot.

Members of the GOP expressed support for U.S. entry of a prominent Austrian far-right activist who was investigated for ties to the suspected gunman in the New Zealand mosque massacre.

In late April, a self-described “American Nationalist” named Brittany Pettibone appeared at a meeting of Kootenai County, Idaho, Republicans to ask for help to bring her boyfriend, Martin Sellner, to the country from Austria, the Associated Press reported.

Pettibone, 26, said Sellner wants to marry her and live in Post Falls, Idaho.

Pettibone was a big promoter of the hoax known as “Pizzagate,” telling her online followers Hillary Clinton and other high-profile Democrats were involved in satanic rituals and child-sex trafficking tied to a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant.

Sellner is a leading figure in the extremist “identitarian” movement, which espouses a white nationalist ideology (that) has swept over Europe amid an influx of migrants and refugees. He has confirmed he exchanged emails with the suspected New Zealand shooter, who donated money to Sellner’s group. But Sellner denies involvement in the attack, according to the wire service.

Despite his background, the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee passed a resolution urging the federal government to allow Sellner into the United States. The resolution said the government revoked Sellner’s travel privileges “for political reasons,” and demanded those privileges be reinstated.

Republican President Trump and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate have made it clear that Islamic extremists from the Middle East will be kept out of the United States.

What about an extremist from Europe?

The nation will be watching to see how the Trump administration treats white extremist Sellner.",mainstream,M13f58,pizzagate
1120,"Actor Alan Thicke, best known for playing the dad on '80s sitcom Growing Pains, has died at the age of 69.

Carleen Donovan, a publicist for one of Thicke's three sons, singer Robin Thicke, said the Canadian-born actor died from a heart attack Tuesday in Los Angeles.

Thicke was playing hockey with his youngest son, Carter, when he suffered the fatal attack, Robin Thicke told the Los Angeles Times.
• Is hockey's start-stop nature hard on the heart?

Earlier in the day, Thicke tweeted his thanks to the Whistler Film Fest, where he had recently received a Canadian Icon award.

Born in Kirkland Lake, Ont., in 1947, Thicke played Dr. Jason Seaver on Growing Pains, a psychiatrist who works out of the home, where he also finds himself juggling the challenges of marriage and parenting.

""I spent Monday through Friday for seven important years with Alan Thicke as my 'TV dad,'"" actor Kirk Cameron said in a statement, adding that he was 'shocked and truly heartbroken' to hear of Thicke's passing.

""Alan was a generous, kind and loving man. I am so blessed to have grown up with him.""

Thicke ""knew how to harness the power of the entertainment industry to be a positive influence in so many lives — including mine. I will be forever grateful for the opportunity I had to work with Alan early in my career,"" said Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio, who had an early role as a homeless youngster taken in by the Seavers on Growing Pains.

""I've seen him a number of times over the years and when Alan Thicke walked in the room, quite frankly, no one was cooler.""

In an interview with q host Tom Power earlier this month, Thicke said he was proud about the show's history of touching on difficult subject matter while maintaining a light and comedic tone. Thicke said the character of Jason Seaver was a blend of his own experiences and the talented writers on the show.

""I think I brought some of my own values, my good old Canadian, northern Ontario backwoods values to the character and, in turn, I learned something from what they were writing, so it was a nice exchange,"" he said.

The show debuted in September 1985 and helped form a strong Tuesday night for ABC, often with Who's the Boss and Moonlighting also in the lineup. Growing Pains ended its run in April 1992.

By the time of his biggest hit, Thicke was already a veteran of nearly two decades in the entertainment business in a host of roles.

Steady work on both sides of border

After graduating from Western University, Thicke began in showbiz with a host of writing credits beginning with commercial jingles for radio.

""I got my BA and that [only] taught me how to find my apartment,"" he joked to Peter Gzowski on CBC's 90 Minutes Live.

He worked for CBC shows and variety specials beginning in the late 1960s, including The Tommy Hunter Show, Time for Living, and That's Showbiz, calling the network ""the best training ground"" despite the occasional bureaucratic challenges.

Thicke in the 1970s and into the early 1980s began to demonstrate his versatility as actor, writer, producer and host.

Among his producing efforts were variety shows featuring music performers Anne Murray, René Simard, Bobby Vinton and Mac Davis, as well as the cult comedy talk show satire Fernwood 2 Night, starring Martin Mull and Fred Willard.

He even wrote several theme songs, usually with his first wife Gloria Loring, for shows including Diff'rent Strokes, The Facts of Life and Wheel of Fortune.

In an email to The Associated Press, Loring described Thicke's passing as ""a shock. We were all just together for Thanksgiving. He was funny, talented and deeply devoted to his family.""
• CBC ARCHIVES l Thicke previews talk show, which would be ill-fated

Between 1980 and 1983, he hosted a Canadian afternoon talk show on CTV called The Alan Thicke Show, which he followed up with the short-lived U.S. late-night show Thicke of the Night, an unsuccessful competitor to The Tonight Show.

""It was a complete dog. Johnny Carson kicked my Canadian butt,"" Thicke joked on q. ""I wasn't very good at late night, which is the domain of stand-up comedy. I was a schmooze-ier kind of guy.""

Most recently, he starred in the film I Don't Care and It's Not My Fault Anyway which premiered Dec. 2 at the Whistler Film Festival in B.C.

Thicke had filmed a guest spot in season two of Fuller House, Netflix's reboot of the '90s family sitcom Full House led by original star Candace Cameron Bure, younger sister of Thicke's former on-screen son Kirk Cameron.

""You were a part of my family and hockey family,"" Bure wrote alongside a photo she posted of herself with Thicke. ""My heart hurts.""

Bob Saget of Full House fame called Thicke ""a good husband, father, brother and friend,"" while comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres declared: ""America loved Alan Thicke.""

He was nominated for three Emmy Awards for his work in the late 1970s as a writer for Barry Manilow's talk show, and later for a satirical take on the genre in the variety show America 2-Night.

When not on screen, Thicke often toured in various musical theatre productions.

Thicke told CBC's Stroumboulopoulos Tonight that he was content with his place in the entertainment industry.

""Instead of me being able to do anything particularly well, I did a bunch of things that were fun and I did them OK … my career has been different just about every day.""

Thicke maintained friendships with a number of expat Canadians in California, including Wayne Gretzky and music producer David Foster. The actor was part of the chorus for the Foster-organized Tears Are Not Enough famine relief song in the mid-1980s.

Thicke said that Gretzky was house-sitting the Thicke residence in California with wife Janet in 1988 when he found out he was traded from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings.

He was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto in 2013.

298,"The Dakota pipeline protests have become the frontline representation of the critical struggle against a completely out of control totalitarian power structure. Those in power cannot afford to allow this justifiable protest to continue or succeed. Geoengineering/weather warfare has now been added to the already long list of criminal assaults that have been hurled at the peaceful pipeline protesters. In the coming days and weeks, weather warfare will likely be the most deadly and effective weapon that the power structure will wield against the pieceful Dakota pipeling protesters.

Record snowfall amounts have buried the pipeline protest camp at Standing Rock Indian Reservation, North Dakota, November 29, 2016​. Photo credit: Reuters

Climate engineering and the use of toxic chemical ice nucleation elements are the reason a record early season snow has just occurred in the exact region of the protests (named winter storm ""Blanche""). If you don't believe snowstorms can be completely engineered, you have not done your research. Weather warfare has long since been a covert weapon of choice for the criminals that truly control our government. Is it just a coincidence that a record early season snowstorm also decimated the Occupy Wall Street protesters?

Occupy Wall Street protesters prepare for the record October, 2011, snowstorm that decimated their camp.

Weather modification activities were also noted over the massive historical gathering in Woodstock. The combination satellite radar images below clearly reveal extreme and completely unnatural weather anomalies over the continental US. The first satellite/radar image below was taken at 11:30 am (ET), Monday, shows a ribbon of warm air and moisture flowing in a northeasterly direction all the way from far west of Baja California, across Mexico and Texas (picking up even more warm moisture from the Gulf of Mexico). This flow of warm air and moisture pushes north where some of it eventually gets caught up in the counterclockwise low pressure system being held directly over the protest region (via atmospheric manipulation with radio frequency/microwave transmissions). An engineered winter chemical ice nucleation assault (by jet aircraft aerosol spraying) was then unleashed in the stationary low pressure circulation.

Note the center of the counterclockwise spinning low pressure system centered almost exactly over the pipeline protest region.

Massive atmospheric aerosol spraying operations were also occurring off of the US west coast on Monday, November 28, 2016. The aerosol saturation reduces west coast precipitation and thus contributes to the effective migration of Pacific moisture further east toward the low pressure vortex over the protest zone.

In addition to the extensive aerosol spraying visible in this NASA satellite image, some radio frequency manipulation waves can be seen in the upper right corner of the satellite image.

By the evening of Monday, November 28, 2016, the huge plum of warm moisture is pulled closer to the still stationary spinning vortex over the Dakota protests.

Aerosolized chemically cooled moisture flowing in from the Pacific also merges with the engineered Dakota snowstorm.

At 9:45 am (ET), November 30, 2016, the stationary Dakota vortex continues to spin (winter storm ""Blanche""). The plume of warm Gulf of Mexico moisture is now directed at Maine, where ""winter storm Blanche"" has been scheduled by the weather makers to continue (completely separated from the still ongoing original ""winter storm Blanche"" over the Dakotas).

The engineered cutoff low pressure zone has remained incredibly stationary and nearly centered over the Dakota pipeline protest zone.

The ""departure from normal high temperature"" map below reveals just how warm it actually was in the regions near the center of the Dakota storm and along the entire track from which much of the storm moisture came.

Radical temperature divides, like the departures from ""normal"" reflected in the map above (shown in degrees Fharenheit +/-), are historically unprecedented. Now such incredible imbalances have increasingly become the norm.

The animation below contains the most revealing and important images of all. Drifting cells of liquid precipitation (rain) should not just ""flash out"" to frozen precipitation (snow) for no reason whatsoever (no change in topographical elevation and no colliding cold air masses). Areas of the storm then suddenly flash back to rain as the jet aircraft sprayed chemical ice nucleating agents settle down through the air column. Examine this animation closely, it is the ""smoking gun"" of a completely engineered chemically nucleated weather warfare assault.

Massive climate engineering/chemical ice nucleation deployments can and will continue to create toxic cool-downs and radical weather anomolies. These anomalies will continue to manipulate the perception of populations who don't realize (or are not willing to accept) what is going on in our skies. All the weather modeling for NOAA and NWS (National Weather Service) is done by private defense contractor, Raytheon, a corporation that is a primary climate engineering entity. This means that the weather forecasts are now the ""scheduled"" weather. Why don't employees of NOAA and NWS speak out about the climate engineering insanity? Because all the employees of both agencies have a federal gag order on them. The NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) extended temperature forecast map for November 6-10 is below.

The ongoing geoengineered cool-down is then ""forecast"" to center almost directly over the Dakota protests (shown in the NOAA map below). Again, it is important to understand and remember that engineering snowstorms is a well established technology that has long since been admitted to by mainstream sources.

The center of the cold zone in the US has remained astoundingly centered over the Dakota water protecter region as the 3rd NOAA ""departure from normal high temperature"" map below reveals.

The NOAA map above shows continued predictions for record cold temperatures at or near the Dakota pipeline protest for yet another 6-10 day period. Also anomolous in the latest forecast map is the building heat dome in the US southwest. Climate enigneerign is greatly contributing to increasingly alarming extream temperature imbalances. Each color tear represents a 2-3 degree departure from normal high temperatures. The NOAA extended forecasts temperature predictions from late November were for the middle northern tear states to be at or near record high temperatures, what changed? The US military industrial complex has long since stated its desire to ""own the weather"" on the record, now they do. If you don't think that the order followers within the ranks of own government and military would carry out such toxic and deadly experimentation/assaults against US citizens, think again.

Why would the global power structure go to such lengths in the attempt to bring the Dakota pipeline protests to end? Because the Dakota protests represent the rapidly growing will and unity of the people to take a stand against the criminal corporate and government tyranny that has completely taken over our country. The power structure will clearly do anything they can get away with to crush this all important protest. We must not let this happen. GeoengineeringWatch.org is working directly with representatives from the protest to test samples of precipitation and aircraft aerosol spraying that has taken place at the protest site. All of us are needed in the critical battle to sound the alarm on what is occurring at the Dakota protest, share credible information, wake others up to the truth, make your voice heard.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The bizarre rumors began with a leaked email referencing Hillary Clinton and sinister interpretations of references to pizza parties. It morphed into fake online news stories about a child sex trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats operating out of a Washington, D.C., pizza joint.

On Sunday, it culminated in violence when police say a North Carolina man fired an assault rifle multiple times inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant as he attempted to “self-investigate” the conspiracy theory known in the Twitterverse as “Pizzagate.”

No one was hurt and the man was arrested. But the shooting alarmed those from neighboring businesses all the way to the White House about the real life dangers of fake news on the internet. One of those posting on the conspiracy theory is the son of President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed national security adviser.

White House Spokesman Josh Earnest, asked about the shooting Monday, said, “There’s no denying the corrosive effect that some of these false reports have had on our political debate ... It’s deeply troubling that some of those false reports could lead to violence.”

Edgar Maddison Welch, 28 of Salisbury, North Carolina, was arrested Sunday afternoon outside the popular eatery in an affluent capital neighborhood, police said.

At a first appearance Monday in D.C. Superior Court, Welch appeared handcuffed in a white jumpsuit and was ordered held pending a hearing Thursday. A public defender representing him didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Comet’s owner, James Alefantis, said in a statement Sunday night: “Let me state unequivocally: These stories are completely and entirely false, and there is no basis in fact to any of them. What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences.”

Still, at least one person clinging to the conspiracy theories is prominently connected to Trump’s transition team. Michael Flynn Jr. is an adviser to his father, Michael Flynn, whom Trump selected to serve as national security adviser.

Flynn Jr. has sent numerous posts on Twitter about the Pizzagate conspiracy theories. Flynn Jr., who has accompanied his father to presidential transition meetings inside Trump Tower and lists the presidential transition website as part of his Twitter bio, tweeted Sunday night that, “Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it’ll remain a story.”

Trump’s team had no immediate response to questions about the conspiracy theory or the younger Flynn’s role in the transition.

Welch was charged on multiple counts, including assault with a dangerous weapon. Police recovered an AR-15 rifle, a Colt .38 handgun, a shotgun and a folding knife.

At an address listed for Welch in Salisbury, a woman drove out as a reporter was approaching and asked him to leave. She then hammered a “no trespassing” sign on a stand by the private driveway.

A Salisbury, North Carolina, police report said Welch hit a 13-year-old pedestrian in October, but was not immediately charged. The teen boy was airlifted to a hospital.

Court records also show Welch pleaded guilty in 2013 to driving while impaired with a blood-alcohol content of .09 and was sentenced to probation and 24 hours of community service. Court documents show he underwent alcohol abuse counseling.

Comet Ping Pong, so named because patrons can play ping pong on tables in its back area, is in a neighborhood of well-tended private homes and apartment buildings on leafy streets dotted by shops, restaurants and the Politics and Prose book store.

While Comet bore most of the scorn heaped by adherents of the Pizzagate conspiracy, businesses all along the block received threats and menacing phone calls, said Bradley Graham and Lissa Muscatine, co-owners of Politics and Prose.

Graham said the store took the threats seriously, reporting them to police. He expressed frustration that police seemed uninterested before Sunday’s shooting in investigating more thoroughly.

“We’ve been trying to deal with this problem for several weeks now,” Graham said.

Joseph E. Uscinski, an associate professor in the political science department at the University of Miami, said it isn’t the first time a conspiracy theory has led to violence.

“Isolated incidents like this do happen,” he said. “Sometimes people believe in conspiracy theories and do act on them,” said Uscinski, who co-authored the book “American Conspiracy Theories.”

The exact origins of the rumors are murky, though it seems to have gained momentum in the week before the election. Some elements trace back to hacked emails from Clinton Chief of Staff John Podesta released by Wikileaks that refer to pizza parties, with online commentators speculating that “pizza party” is a code word for something more nefarious. By Nov. 3, Comet had been pulled into the conspiracy.

On Sunday, police said, Welch fired several times inside the restaurant. Authorities set up a perimeter and arrested Welch after he walked out with his hands up and unarmed, leaving his weapons inside, according to court records and Interim D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham.

Court records released Monday showed that Welch “surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.”

374,"A haunting final video has emerged of actor Isaac Kappy who live-streamed for an hour about the 'darkness' he suffered three days before he took his own life on Monday.

In the video, Kappy talk about letting darkness 'consume' him and referred to himself as a 'bad guy'.

He does not explicitly state his plan to kill himself and it is so far unclear. He is believed to have posted it online on Friday but it is not clear where it surfaced first.

After news of his suicide emerged, YouTube fans reposted it in their droves.

The video gives an insight into the 42-year-old's troubled mind at the time of his death. Known for his appearances in Thor and Terminator, Kappy was also notable because he was accused of 'choking' Paris Jackson.

In recent years, he had become obsessed with exposing pedophilia in Hollywood and in his video, he talks about letting that effort take over his life.

In the video, throughout which a dog can be heard yapping in the background, he said repeatedly: 'I let the darkness consume me.'

He refers to a 'really stupid, cynical, heavy decision' that he made recently, and said: 'I didn't spend enough time nurturing the light and love within me.

'I let down some really great people and it was my desire to serve these people but that desire was not born out of a love that is pure.'

At the end, he says: 'Guys, once I found out about pizza gate I was literally, I put thousands of hours into this, thousands of hours, but what happened? I became so focused with the externalizations of evil that i did not find the evil within and focus on the light.

'Maybe I'll be back later. I love you. Take care, OK.'

He went on to say he had done a 'disservice' to God and to 'a lot of people' and he called himself a 'traitor'.

Officials confirmed on Tuesday that Kappy, 42, was struck by a Ford pickup truck after hurling himself from the Transwestern Road bridge onto Interstate 40, where he died, according a statement from Bart Graves, a spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Public Safety.

In the 24 hours leading up to his death, Kappy posted a long statement on Instagram where he wrote, 'I have not been a good guy,' and 'I have been abusive to people who loved me.'

The self-admitted drug user made headlines in 2018 for allegedly assaulting Michael Jackson's daughter, Paris, by choking her 'during a game night party.'

The native Angeleno has also publicly accused Seth Green of being a pedophile.

Arizona state troopers were called to the scene at 7.26am Mountain on Monday, and Kappy was found deceased upon their arrival, Graves' statement said.

Before the Beerfest actor died, 'several bystanders tried physically restraining Kappy from jumping but failed to hold him,' TMZ reported.

No one else was reported injured in the incident, and the investigation has officially been closed.

Kappy's Instagram post on Sunday was captioned, 'Beware the man has nothing to lose, for he has nothing to protect.'

In the message posted as a screenshot of text he wrote, 'Over the course of the last week, through introspection that should have happened MANY years ago, I have come to some stark revelations about my character. It is a testament to my utter ignorance that these revelations had not come sooner.

'You see, I believed myself to be a good guy. I HAVE NOT been a good guy. In fact, I have been a pretty bad guy throughout my life.'

Kappy penned a scathing assessment of his own character, writing, I have used people for money. I have betrayed MANY people and much trust.

'I have sold drugs. I have tax delinquencies. I have debts. I have abused my body with cigarettes, drugs and alcohol.'

Throughout the message, Kappy mentioned 'the Q movement' and said 'I am so so sorry to have brought shame upon the greatest military operation of all time.

Kappy referenced suicide in a metaphor, as well, writing, 'Q says they give people enough rope to hang themselves, and I have hung myself.'

He also claimed to have 'betrayed' Donald Trump and Jesus Christ in the missive, referencing death again.

'I have told people in the Trump administration that I am willing to admit to my many crimes in a public setting, and committed to execution, in a public setting,' Kappy wrote. 'A nation cannot suffer its traitors, and I am no exception.'

Kappy was reportedly being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department for threatening Paris Jackson , and other celebrities.

According to TMZ, Kappy allegedly choked Paris during a game night party.

This might have been referenced in his farewell message, as well, where he wrote, 'I have been abusive to people WHO LOVED ME, including my FAMILY.

'To the many people I have acted abusively towards, I am very, very sorry. To my former friends I have used and betrayed, I am sorry.'

The 21-year-old model had allegedly received 'rambling and scary' texts from her former pal. Sources claim she initially responded to them to help him because she though he was suicidal at that time, as well.

She was later forced to move home and hire extra bodyguards, along with blocking Kappy's number.

Police opened an investigation into the actor after seeing a particularly menacing tweet from Kappy on August 1 that read: 'In light of the interesting traffic happening around my house I want to make something CRYSTAL CLEAR: While I am a VERY strong advocate of peaceful disclosure, make no mistake, assets are in place and if you kill me or even try, it will rain .50 cals in the Hollywood Hills.'

Per his Twitter account, Kappy appeared to be on a crusade to take down people he believes are sexually abusing children.

He wrote in his post on Sunday, 'While it's true I have spent many, many hours of research and disseminating information about bad actors, I have had SO LITTLE CARE for introspection about MY OWN actions.

'And while it's true I have outed many pedophiles that were former FRIENDS, I remained in their sphere for much longer than I should have, and attempted to gain from them AFTER I knew about their actions. And in my SHEER ARROGANCE I did not even reflect on this fact.'

His timeline is full of retweeted news stories about pedophiles and rants about high-profile people accused of sex crimes and some who aren't. He accused Green of being a pedophile in a video posted in July.

Kappy had also, according to his Twitter, tried to reach out to Corey Feldman to take on pedophilia together. Corey blocked him on Twitter and did not respond.

He previously called out the cast of Guardians of the Galaxy for defending ousted director James Gunn and Bill Clinton.

Kappy added, 'It should be noted that I have recently been made to believe that I am the reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, the great betrayer. And while I could have utilized this period of great awakening to AWAKEN myself, I have used it focused on the darkness OF OTHERS and not the darkness WITHIN.'

Kappy ended his final message writing, 'See the light in others. Nurture the light in yourself. This lesson has come too late for me, but perhaps it can inspire you. I will be using the remainder of my time on earth to atone for my transgressions, and to seek the light within, in others and myself.'

The letter was mysteriously dated at the bottom, 'July 4th, 2019' and signed off with 'Return of the King Return to THE LIGHT.'

714,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A man who said he was investigating a conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring out of a pizza place fired an assault rifle inside the Washington, D.C., restaurant on Sunday injuring no one, police and news reports said.

Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Aquita Brown said police detained a 28-year-old man from Salisbury, North Carolina. The deputy mayor for public safety and justice said on Twitter the suspect has been identified as Edgar Maddison Welch.

Police responded and arrested Welch without incident. They recovered an “assault rifle,” Brown said. Welch was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon.

Two firearms were recovered inside the restaurant and an additional weapon was recovered from the suspect’s vehicle, police said in a statement on Sunday evening.

The suspect entered the location and pointed a firearm in the direction of an employee of the restaurant, the MPD said in a statement. The victim was able to flee and notify police. The suspect fired an undetermined number of shots inside of the restaurant, according to the MPD.

During a post-arrest interview, the suspect also revealed that he came to the establishment to self-investigate “Pizza Gate,” the MPD said in a statement.

As CBS affiliate WUSA reported previously, using the hashtag #PizzaGate, an imaginary story about the popular pizza shop was spread across social media and websites associated with the “alt-right” movement, accusing its proprietors of allowing Bill and Hillary Clinton and her former campaign manager to run a child sex slave ring from the business.

As a result, the pizza place has been hammered by thousands of threats and bizarre, unsubstantiated tales about child sex trafficking online for weeks.

WUSA reported that they found two women, who declined to give their names, banging on the patio at the pizza place in late November. The women were looking for the alleged tunnels used to traffic children.

“All of this is an underground tunnel that helps take the kids and transport them back and forth so they can can do these rituals,” said one of them. “They are putting a lot of curses and spells over the city. They are kidnapping the children who are missing. They were never missing because D.C. know where they are.”

Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis said then that the restaurant does not even have a basement.

He said he suspected the story simply emerged because he and a friend supported the Clinton campaign.

“These people are destroying their lives,” said neighbor Maura Dougherty about the conspiracy theorists. “It’s insane.”

Before the latest incident, Comet Ping Pong’s owner told WUSA that the PizzaGate conspirators have also harassed and abused his staff. The manager got so many threats and vulgar messages, his wife asked him to quit his job. And the online bullies have gone after other businesses on the block as well.",mainstream,M18d83,pizzagate
917,"LONDON — U.K. counter-terrorism police have charged a 25-year-old man with three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder for a stabbing attack in an English park that killed three men a week ago.

British prosecutors authorized the charges filed Saturday against Khairi Saadallah, of Reading. The attack happened June 20 at Forbury Gardens park in Reading, a town of 200,000 people some 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of London.

The three victims, friends who were identified by police as teacher James Furlong, 36, scientist David Wails, 49, and pharmaceutical worker Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, were enjoying a warm Saturday evening at the park when they were stabbed. Police said Friday that each man had received a single fatal blow.

Three other people also were wounded and have since been released from the hospital. Police declared the stabbings as a terrorist incident the day after the attack, but they have not said what they think the motive was and noted the investigating is ongoing.",mainstream,M11a1b,pizzagate

708,"This article contains disturbing content and addresses an issue that desperately needs to be brought to light.

Every single year, pedophilia, sexual abuse, and sex trafficking rates increase. The International Labor Organization estimates that there are 20.9 million human trafficking victims worldwide and 4.5 million people trapped in forced sex trafficking around the globe. At least 100,000 children are prostituted annually in the U.S., adding to the $9.8 billion U.S. sex trafficking industry.

It’s not just pimps and escaped convicts involved. It’s the people we’re expected to respect or “look up to” the most: the politicians, the elite, the wealthy businessmen, your neighbours, and oftentimes the people that you’d least expect.

In this particularly devastating case, it’s the people we’re supposed to trust to help others: the United Nations’ peacekeepers. As it turns out, these people are anything but “peace keepers.” Instead, they’re the ones wreaking havoc in these villages and causing children to have nightmares for the rest of their lives.

An Associated Press investigation into the United Nations (UN) has revealed that over the past 12 years, there have been approximately 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by UN peacekeepers and other employees around the world. Over 300 of those cases involved children; however, very few perpetrators have actually been arrested and held accountable for their crimes.

The Child Sex Ring Run by UN Peacekeepers in Haiti

Many of the children living in poverty in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, are left to fend for themselves, scavenging for food and struggling with hunger on a daily basis. Their lives drastically changed when the UN peacekeepers moved to their village, as they were offered snacks and cookies.

However, this food came with a heavy price no one should ever have to pay. In exchange for food, the UN peacekeepers demanded sex from children as young as 12. In regards to the child sex ring run by UN peacekeepers in Haiti, nine children were being passed around from 2004 to 2007.

“I did not even have breasts,” said a girl, known as “V01” (Victim No. 1). Vo1 was allegedly forced to have sex with approximately 50 peacekeepers over a period of three years, between the ages of 12 and 15. One of the perpetrators was a “Commandant” who she said gave her 75 cents in exchange for sex. Vo1 explained that she would often sleep in UN trucks on the base.

A young boy, Vo9, was 15 when he was first sexually abused by a UN peacekeeper. Over the next three years, he was allegedly forced to have sex with over 100 Sri Lankan peacekeepers, on average four times per day.

There are hundreds of other cases like these, yet very few of the perpetrators have been held accountable for their actions. From a legal perspective, the UN has no jurisdiction over peacekeepers so the organization can’t exactly put them on trial. In addition, the names of the peacekeepers who were found guilty have been kept confidential, meaning it’s impossible to figure out who’s involved.

The UN actually found out about what was going on and the only action the organization took was to send home 114 of the peacekeepers. Of the 114 UN peacekeepers involved, no one was imprisoned. Though this put an end to that specific sex ring, the sexual abuse and exploitation in Haiti by UN peacekeepers didn’t stop there.

In addition, when the sex ring was being investigated, a team of Sri Lankan officials traveled to Haiti for two weeks to further investigate the allegations. They only communicated with 25 soldiers out of more than 900 in the country and their findings indicated that only two corporals and one private were involved with having sex with two “young” victims. This is obviously a vast understatement of the amount of Sri Lankan peacekeepers involved and speaks to the level of corruption that exists within the political system.

After considerable evasion, the Sri Lankan government came forward stating that it had only further investigated 18 soldiers and that “the U.N. Secretariat has acknowledged in writing, action taken by the Government, and informed that the Secretariat, as of 29 September 2014, considers the matter closed.”

As of last year, some of the peacekeepers involved in the ring were still in the Sri Lankan military and the UN continues to send Sri Lankan peacekeepers to Haiti.

To be clear, it wasn’t just UN peacekeepers from Sri Lanka involved in the sexual abuse and exploitation of Haitians. Alleged abusers were from Bangladesh, Brazil, Jordan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uruguay, and Sri Lanka, according to UN data and interviews.

You can watch the Associated Press’ video regarding the sex ring and abuse in Haiti below:

“Let us declare in one voice: We will not tolerate anyone committing or condoning sexual exploitation and abuse. We will not let anyone cover up these crimes with the U.N. flag,” Guterres stated.

Though his sentiments seem sincere, he also sounds sort of like a broken record that’s continuously regurgitating the same message. If his statement has a familiar ring to it, it’s because it closely resembles statements made in a report the UN commissioned over a decade ago promising to abolish any and all sexual abuse. Yet somehow the organization still struggles with this reoccurring issue.

Officials have known that Haitian children were being abused by UN peacekeepers, and no one has done anything about it. It’s not that none of these children are coming forward, it’s that no one has bothered to hold the perpetrators responsible for their actions, including the UN.

In one case, an 11-year-old boy was gang-raped by a group of Uruguayan UN peacekeepers, who actually filmed their actions on a cell phone. The video ended up going viral, and despite this important piece of evidence, none of the perpetrators went to trial in Haiti and only four of the five were convicted of “private violence” in Uruguay, a far lesser charge than they deserved. Officials spun the video as “a prank gone wrong,” when in reality it was clearly rape.

It’s not only in Haiti, either; UN peacekeepers and other employees have been sexually abusing and exploiting children all over the world. Keep in mind that out of the 2,000 cases reported, only 150 of those were actually in Haiti.

There was another pedophile ring in the Democratic Republic of Congo that the UN was involved in — UN police officers in Bosnia paid for prostitutes and were caught trafficking young women from Eastern Europe — and the UN was involved with child sexual abuse and rape in the Central African Republic as well.

Assistant Secretary-General for Field Support Tony Banbury addressed the allegations in the Central African Republic last year in the following video. Banbury is clearly overcome with emotions as he stops to cry when discussing these terrifying abuse allegations. Though his speech is moving, his promise that the “United Nations is doing everything we possibly can to assist the victims and bring accountability and justice for them, and hopefully to prevent any such cases from reoccurring,” seems less sincere since this issue is still ongoing.

Some question whether or not the United Nations does more harm than good. Although the UN has clearly provided immense aid all over the world, the organization is also responsible for some of the corruption that exists in the places it provides aid to. Even the origin of the UN is questionable, as the global elite helped create it, including the Rothschild’s and Rockefeller’s families.

To be clear, it’s not just children who have fallen victim to the hands of UN peacekeepers, either. Many adult Haitian women have come forward saying that they were raped by peacekeepers too.

Haitian lawyer Mario Joseph has been trying to obtain justice for these women and children, fighting for them to get compensated for numerous reasons. Some of the victims were allegedly exposed to a deadly cholera strain from being sexually abused, as the specific strain was linked to Nepalese peacekeepers who killed approximately 10,000 people. Joseph is also trying to get compensation for the Haitian women who were raped by peacekeepers and were then left pregnant.

“Imagine if the U.N. was going to the United States and raping children and bringing cholera,” Joseph explained in Port-au-Prince. “Human rights aren’t just for rich white people.”

His last point is one that society desperately needs to be reminded of: All people are entitled to basic human rights, not just the ruling elite. Politicians, corporate leaders, and the elite get off scot-free all the time, despite the havoc they’ve wreaked in other people’s lives. They’re often seen as being above the law and above other people, which should not be the case for anyone, regardless of social status.

Where do lawmakers and the government come into all of this? Perhaps if the government allocated more resources toward finding and punishing perpetrators and preventing these sex rings from existing in the first place, sexual abuse and pedophilia wouldn’t be such a large-scale issue. However, the sad reality is, the government and the forces that control it are often a contributing part of the problem.

Government and Elite Linked to Pedophilia and Sex Rings

Sexual violence and war go hand-in-hand. This has been a long-standing issue, and not just during World War 1 and World War 2, but during all times of conflict. For example, approximately 100 girls in the Central African Republic were sexually assaulted by international peacekeepers, not just UN ones, and three of them were “tied up, undressed, and forced to have sex with a dog” by a French military commander in 2014.

There has also been a lot of speculation lately on child sex rings being used by the U.S. government as well. You may be familiar with the PizzaGate scandal, which allegedly unearthed a very high-level elitist global pedophile ring the U.S. government was involved in.

It emerged when Wikileaks released tens of thousands of emails from the former White House Chief of Staff under Bill Clinton, Jon Podesta, who also served as Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager. It’s because of these emails that many claimed Jon Podesta was a part of these child trafficking rings as well.

Former U.S. representative Cynthia McKinney also knew about the government’s relationship to human trafficking, and she actually addressed it in 2005. She grilled Donald Rumsfeld on military contractor DynCorp’s child trafficking business of selling women and children (source).

Another individual involved in high-level trafficking was Jeffrey E. Epstein, who in 2009 pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from girls as young as fourteen. He served just over a year in jail and became a registered high-risk sex offender. He was close to Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and many other elitists.

According to former U.S. State Department official Steve Pieczenik, the Clintons and many more “have been a major part and participant of what’s called the Lolita Express, which is a plane owned by Mr. Jeff Epstein, a wealthy multi-millionaire who flies down to the Bahamas and allows Bill and Hillary Clinton to engage in sex with minors — that is called Pedophilia” (source).

Numerous victims involved in elite sex rings and occult sex rituals have come forward, exposing high-level corruption in regards to human sex trafficking and pedophilia. One of the more recent victims to come forward was a woman named Kendall who was sold at birth into a powerful, high-level international sex ring.

How Do We Deal With All of This?

The sad truth is that this article represents only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to high level pedophilia and sexual abuse. There’s so much more information on this topic out there, and keep in mind that whatever research you can find is only what’s been reported on; there are so many more victims that don’t come forward. I encourage you to read the full article on the United Nations peacekeepers’ involvement in child sex rings and sexual abuse by the Associated Press here.

It’s easy to get overwhelmed by all of the darkness in the world, especially when it comes to people abusing their power and preying on the innocent and the vulnerable. Society tends to take polar opposites on this issue: We either attempt to hide these actions and wrongly blame the victims, or we demonize and ostracize the perpetrators.

We tend to dehumanize pedophiles, child molesters, rapists, and abusers, demanding punishment for their crimes and responding to their actions with hate and anger. However, if we fail to recognize the humanity in them, how will we ever learn why these violent acts occurred in the first place?

Have you ever made a mistake that forced you to really question your humanity? In reality, our mistakes don’t dehumanize us; rather, they’re part of what makes us human in the first place. So whether you like it or not, people who engage in violent sexual acts are just as “human” as you are. Yet so many people respond to these acts with that same hatred and anger that likely caused the perpetrator to be so violent in the first place.

We shouldn’t be encouraging victims to hate their perpetrators, nor should we be judging or expressing hatred toward those who engage in sex rings, rape, etc. By choosing hate, we end up bottling up anger and resentment, which ultimately hurts no one but ourselves. If we choose to feel all of our emotions, let them pass through us, and then choose forgiveness instead, we can learn to better cope with the more difficult events in our lives. Even if you feel the perpetrator doesn’t deserve forgiveness, I’m sure you can agree that the victim deserves freedom.

Choosing forgiveness doesn’t have to mean compliance, either. We can still change this reality without attaching ourselves to our emotions. By shifting our consciousness and educating others, we can hopefully put an end to these violent acts.",conspiracy,C02633,pizzagate
654,"Frontline executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath was in her office late last summer when special projects editor Philip Bennett walked in. He’d just been watching the raw footage from Frontline’s upcoming documentary, “Putin’s Revenge,” a two-part program about Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 election. The interviews were amazing, he said. What if they put them online?

All of them.

“We’d been talking for a long time about what we could do at Frontline to really put a stake in the ground, that we are committed to transparency,” Aronson-Rath says. “A lightbulb went on, that this is the one we should go big on.”

The production team swung into action. At the same time editors and interns were working to produce the program to air that fall, behind the scenes they were also preparing 70 hours’ worth of interviews to post on the web. They fact-checked each, and vetted them with lawyers with the same care they did for the documentary itself.

Frontline’s Transparency Project is one of a number of new attempts by media to open up the process they use to create their journalism to engender more trust with audiences

But Aronson-Rath and her team didn’t want to just dump 56 interviews for audiences to sift through on their own. They used open-source software Bennett had helped create to make the films searchable by text, so viewers could easily find footage on specific subjects. They could even splice out a section and share it on social media. The result is both an exhaustive look at the issue of Russian hacking and an unparalleled look behind-the-scenes at the reporting process. In four months, the videos had more than 300,000 views, with 40 percent of web traffic referred by social media. What’s more, visitors spent twice as long with the interviews—an average of 28 minutes, much longer even than Aronson-Rath and Bennett anticipated—as the average visitor to the Frontline site. “Things that I myself wouldn’t have considered as part of the story now have relevance. It gives me a moment for pause. I am now watching from an expanded viewpoint and it’s interesting to see what is corroborated through other sources and what is not,” one viewer commented.

The Transparency Project, as Frontline is calling the effort, is one of a number of new attempts by media to open up the process they use to create their journalism to engender more trust with audiences. In a January Gallup/Knight Foundation poll of more than 19,000 Americans, respondents ranked their trust of media at only 37 out of 100. Just 50 percent of respondents said they had enough information to sort out facts in the face of media bias, down from 66 percent in 1984. Among Republicans, that number was even lower, only 31 percent.

Frontline has long been putting the complete transcripts of its interviews online—but putting the searchable videos online is a dramatic expansion of that proposition, laying bare the process of making documentaries, warts and all. “You see the real deal, people swiping their face, laughing, looking nervous,” Aronson-Rath says.

In many ways, the new push for transparency is a response to the current media environment of “fake news”—both the dissemination of actual false stories online and through social media, and the cries from the current administration that stories it doesn’t like are “fake.” As more and more Americans get their news through social media, content gets divorced from context that allows readers to decide whether a story is trustworthy.

“People are getting their news through every possible medium and on every possible device,” says Melody Kramer, senior audience development manager at the Wikimedia Foundation and columnist for the Poynter Institute. “It’s a challenge to figure out the veracity of the information, where it came from, what the point of view is, or how it was put together.” That creates more of an imperative for news organizations to pull back the curtain to explain to readers how they report and write stories. “It becomes incumbent upon organizations—that are trying to improve our lower-d democracy—to open up a window into how they do the work they do.”

At the same time, transparency can serve a defensive function, insulating the media from attacks of political bias or unfairness. As far back as 2009, Harvard technologist David Weinberger declared that “transparency is the new objectivity,” making a writer more credible in the eyes of readers not through adherence to a supposed standard of impartiality, but by making clear the “sources and values that brought her to that position.”

Among those organizations leading the current charge to increase transparency is the American Press Institute (API), which in 2014 produced a report entitled “Build Credibility Through Transparency.” The report advocated for publications to “show their work” by being clearer about their sources and correcting mistakes. In the run-up to the 2016 election, API consulted with news organizations about how to better disclose sources, using PolitiFact as a model. But it was unprepared for the level of hostility toward media and the allegations of bias and “fake news.”

“That’s when we started seeing a problem with misinformation, of which ‘fake news’ is part of that universe,” says Jane Elizabeth, accountability program director, who was surprised by the lack of media literacy among audiences and their willingness to believe outlandish stories with little sourcing, such as the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory. “Readers were confused and unable to tell the difference between misinformation, disinformation, and ‘fake news,’” Elizabeth says.

She places most of the blame on the current administration for deliberately sowing that confusion. “Trump’s candidacy had everything to do with this,” she says. “It was the type of campaign we had never dealt with before.” At the same time, she faults the media for not opening its doors to show the level of editorial care and vetting that goes into the news. “People think anyone can write something and press a button and it appears online.”

The first step toward transparency, she says, is to listen to readers about what they don’t know—and what they want to know—about how news is gathered, verified, and reported. “Otherwise, you are just divulging the wrong things.” Some things that might seem obvious to journalists, such as the ethics of using an anonymous source, may be opaque to readers and sow confusion and distrust.

API is not the only organization working with publications to improve transparency. Transparency advocate Josh Stearns of the Democracy Fund has spent the last two years working with newsrooms across New Jersey on how to better engage with readers and open up their reporting to scrutiny. While such initiatives can be time- and resource-intensive, he says, they can also help bolster revenue by explaining the value of rigorous reporting.

“Helping people understand the labor that goes into reporting, is a powerful way to build a relationship with the reader that will cause them to want to support it,” Stearns says. Such support can go beyond merely financial. “If we want the public to stand up for our rights for FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] requests, or when local mayors want to block us, then we want to have the public’s back and we want them to have ours.”

Other active transparency initiatives include the Trusting News project run by Joy Mayer and supported by the Reynolds Journalism Institute at the University of Missouri, which has surveyed thousands of journalists and readers and is working with 14 newsrooms on experiments to engage more authentically with readers; and the newly launched News Co/Lab, funded mainly by the Facebook Journalism Project and run by veteran journalist Dan Gillmor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, which is partnering with the McClatchy newspaper group.

One of the most ambitious efforts to improve media transparency is the Trust Project, an initiative of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. Led by journalist Sally Lehrman, the project worked with newsroom leaders from 75 publications to develop a common set of standards for transparency it calls “trust indicators.” In November, about 10 publications began rolling out the indicators worldwide, including The Economist, Mic, and The Washington Post. Significantly, the project has gotten social media sites and search engines including Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Bing on board as partners; the sites have agreed to start using the indicators in their feeds to give users a measure of the trustworthiness of articles.

In many ways, the new push for transparency is a response to the current media environment of “fake news”

“In the case where the work is divorced from the brand, you can see some of the markers that might help you know this piece of journalism and the quality behind it,” says Lehrman. Unlike, say, a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, which would rely on an outside entity to certify a brand as trustworthy, the project presents a set of guidelines to publications they can adapt as they see fit, under eight headings, including standards and practices; author expertise; citations and references; and diverse voices. (Partners are free to use the TrustMark, a T logo designed by the project, or not.)

Under standards and practices, for example, the project requires that organizations clearly post their mission statement and ethics and corrections policy, both on a site level and with each individual piece. “These are often straightforward to journalists, but at the same time they are not often spelled out,” says Lehrman. “A lot of people don’t realize they exist.” Even in cases where sites include such policies, they are often hidden, buried on a second or third page on their website.

In addition to providing greater information about the publication, Lehrman and other transparency advocates are also pushing to include more about story authors, including their local or demographic background, years of experience in covering subject matter, awards they have won, and languages spoken—which is especially important for those covering minority or refugee communities.

Publications may also consider including a statement with stories they publish, particularly for stories that might be controversial or political in nature and open themselves to criticism. “It really forces the reporter to think about, why did I do this story, why was it important?” says Elizabeth. For example, a story written in a newspaper in a farming state about the use of toxic fertilizers could open journalists up to allegations of bias against the farming industry. “You really need to explain why you are stepping into this volatile subject,” says Elizabeth. “We are doing this story because our state has the highest percentage of dangerous nutrients in the water. Just so people don’t think, ‘look, that liberal democrat is trying to ruin our economy,’ just to show it’s a serious topic worth consideration.”

Just as important is that publications come clean when they make errors. Publishing on the web, it can be tempting to make changes on the sly, hoping that readers won’t notice. But that’s bad practice, say transparency advocates. Not only do readers notice when a story changes—which may increase skepticism over time—but also consistently seeing corrections on other stories might increase their perception that stories without corrections are accurate.

As News Co/Lab’s Dan Gillmor says, over time that may cause the public to believe a publication less, but trust it more. “The more you explain what you screwed up on, the more people are going to realize that journalism has its flaws, so the belief that any given story is 100 percent correct will drop,” says Gillmor, who is working with The Kansas City Star to develop a model corrections policy. “But I would hope that the trust in journalists to work really hard to make sure you know about the mistakes and correct them would improve.”

Transparency advocates recommend making corrections at the same level as the original mistake—if the error was on the front page, then the correction should be, too. For stories online, corrections should be clearly noted at the beginning or end of the article. Some publications are experimenting with putting corrections inline, either through crossing out and inserting text or noting corrections in the margin with a link to the corrections note.

Furthermore, a growing consensus among advocates is that the old adage that you don’t repeat a mistake in making the correction is no longer true. Because users may not be reading the publication daily or have seen the original story, it raises more questions than it answers to leave readers in the dark about the original error. Rather, the correction should clearly state the original error, as well as the correct information.

The first step toward transparency is to listen to readers about what they don’t know—and what they want to know—about how news is gathered, verified, and reported

The big question right now is whether such transparency will lead to an increase in trust. Research by Michael Koliska, a Georgetown University communications professor, suggests that there are no easy solutions when it comes to creating more trust. For his Ph.D. dissertation, published in 2015, Koliska set up several experiments in which he gave six versions of an article with varying degrees of information, from one that didn’t even have a byline to one with a byline, author bio, and information about the sources and production process.

The additional information, however, had no effect on whether readers found the story more trustworthy. In fact, says Koliska, readers barely seemed to register it. When he included a picture of the journalist on the page, and then showed a lineup of pictures afterwards, participants only picked out the right one about a third of the time. “There are a lot of these kinds of things that people just didn’t care about,” he says. “The transparency information was too peripheral to the story.”

In another paper published in 2016 in the Journal of Media Ethics, Koliska and his colleague Kalyani Chadha argue that rather than “digitally outsourcing” transparency information by adding transparency features to web pages or publishing separate stories about the process behind the article, journalists should work the information into the story, giving more background on the process and extent of the reporting and sources consulted as part of the story itself rather than relying on hyperlinks or author bios.

That doesn’t mean that providing transparency indicators isn’t worthwhile, says Koliska. As awareness of “fake news” and disinformation grows, it may cause people to seek out more information about transparency. “They will realize that they are not getting the high-quality product they want—they are getting McDonald’s sold as a Whole Foods meal, and crave something better,” he says.

Research by the Trust Project shows that may already be happening. Working with the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin, the Trust Project funded a study in which some 1,200 participants read online articles on different topics; some included the trust indicators, such as author bios, links, a “Behind the Story” companion article, and an indicator of whether the publication belonged to the Trust Project.

A small majority felt that such indicators would increase their trust of the publication, with the most (63 percent) citing the Trust Project logo, followed by a “Behind the Story” section (59 percent) and a list of corrections and ethics policies (53 percent). In addition, by a small but statistically significant margin, readers were more likely to use adjectives like “reputable,” “reliable,” and “can be trusted” for articles with indicators. “As newsrooms grapple with ways to win over doubting audiences, we find the study results encouraging,” the authors of the study noted. “The results … demonstrate that Trust Indicators can affect what people think about the news.”

As much as the online environment has eroded trust and created the need for more transparency, it also offers unique tools to increase transparency. As Frontline’s Putin documentary shows, nowhere is that the case more than in allowing journalists to “show their work” by providing access to the original source material so readers can make up their own minds about how it was used.

The Trust Project has advocated for a separate “citations and references” box that lists the key sources an article relies on; some partners such as Mic and The Economist are already using those boxes. When the project did a focus group to gauge their effectiveness, they found they increased perceptions of credibility even if readers didn’t click through to the underlying sources. Just letting the reader know that a journalist conducted additional research, even if it wasn’t included in the piece can increase reader confidence. “What if at the end of the story you listed the number of sources you reached out to, even though 20 of them were on background,” Stearns proposes.

Some publications are taking sourcing to the next level by including not only interviews, but underlying documents and source material to bolster claims in a story. ProPublica has long been a leader in this endeavor, using Document Cloud to upload and annotate documents for readers to peruse. “It has always been core to how we do our journalism,” says editor in chief Steve Engelberg. “In an era of complaints about fake news the best answer we can have in the fact-based universe is to provide the reader with as much fact as possible.”

For a story about death and complication rates by surgeons in 2015, ProPublica included a Surgeon Scorecard with a searchable database readers could use to look up specific doctors. The site also included a detailed discussion of its methodology for calculating rates, quotes from experts backing up their methods, and an editor’s note from Engelberg describing the reasoning behind the story. At the end of the note, Engelberg invited criticism from readers with a dedicated email address to receive them. While the site has pushed back against some of the criticism, it has taken some of it to heart, such as the fact that it only takes into account inpatient procedures, and will be using it to adjust their methodology for a planned Surgeon Scorecard 2.0.

ProPublica has made a habit of responding publicly to its critics, even when they publish their critiques elsewhere—acknowledging it when they feel the critics have a point, and pushing back when they feel like they don’t. “At the end of the day, we live in a universe where people are going to say things about your work, and there is no waving it off, like we have the printing press and you don’t,” Engelberg says.

In some cases, ProPublica has seen unintended consequences from its transparency—as was the case when it published a database of rates of prescriptions by doctors to draw attention to an epidemic of overprescribing opioids and other potentially dangerous narcotics. Analyzing web traffic, ProPublica’s editors noticed an uptick in traffic to the database, after Google searches such as “doctors who prescribe narcotics easily,” implying that readers were using the database to find doctors to prescribe them drugs.

Rather than pulling the database, ProPublica made the fact a further exercise in transparency, running an editor’s note explaining the problem, and adding a new disclaimer to the database warning about the dangers of addictive drugs. “This is an ethically tricky area,” says Engelberg. “We weighed the possibility that we were going to make it worse, but if you are in a glass house cajoling institutions to be transparent, then to know something about our work and not make it public seemed against the principles of what we do.”In deciding whether and how to release controversial documents, the more publications can let the reader into their decision-making process, the better they might be received by audiences. In January 2017, for example, when BuzzFeed released the Steele dossier containing allegations that the Trump administration colluded with the Russians, for example, it provided little explanation of the pros and cons of making the unverified document public—saying only that it wanted to let “Americans make up their own minds about the allegations.”

The big question right now is whether such transparency will lead to an increase in trust

Arguably, the publication could have taken readers behind the scenes to provide more detail about how they made this tricky journalistic decision, and how it aligned with their ethical and procedural policies, says Elizabeth. Such a thoughtful explanation may have mitigated some of the questioning and backlash it received from politicians and other news outlets about the choice. “I do believe BuzzFeed editors could have offered readers a little more gut-level transparency about their decision to release the dossier,” Elizabeth says. “But every one of these situations is an opportunity for all of us to figure out how to do it better next time.”

In addition to opening up their sources to scrutiny, some publications and journalists have taken the public inside the reporting process itself—as The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold has done while reporting on Donald Trump’s supposed donations to charity. From the start of his reporting, Fahrenthold posted his progress on Twitter, showing his followers photos of his notebook with charities he was exploring, and even trading barbs with Trump himself. The openness paid off with members of the public, and even other journalists tweeting him tips—including one Univision journalist alerting him to the location of a portrait of himself Trump had bought with charity money, hanging on the wall at a Florida golf club.

When the nonprofit Project Veritas set up a sting operation to trick the Post’s reporters with a false claim of having been impregnated by U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, the Post produced a story and 10-minute video about how it uncovered the sting, and even set up a sting of its own, showing the woman in an interview with a Post reporter, and explaining why it broke the agreement of confidentiality, since she had misrepresented herself in an attempt to embarrass the paper.

The Post further elaborated on how it broke the story about Roy Moore’s legitimate accusers in a video produced by reporter Libby Casey, part of a new series called “How to Be a Journalist,” which seeks to take readers inside the goings-on of the newsroom. “I was getting so many questions from friends and other people who aren’t in media about how we do what we do,” she says. “It showed me that with a little transparency we could turn our storytelling around to show how we do our work.”

Casey interviews her colleagues in an irreverent, almost jaunty style in an effort to present them in an authentic, human light. In interviewing reporter Stephanie McCrummen about the Roy Moore story, for example, she discusses the anxiety reporters feel knocking on doors with a notepad ready. Another video features database editor Steven Rich, who describes how he submitted 1,500 FOIA requests last year—detailing how readers can submit their own open records request to the government. “If we can demystify the process, it does empower people to learn what their own role can be in a democracy.”

The Toronto Star has quickly become a model of transparency with its efforts to open up the newsroom to reader scrutiny. Last year, the paper’s managing editor Irene Gentle started seeing an uptick in complaints and harassment against the paper that corresponded to the skepticism south of the border against fake news. “She became frustrated by the fact that we know there is a lot of hard work behind our journalism that is being done by solid ethical principles,” says public editor Kathy English, “but readers weren’t getting that.”

Starting in May last year, the paper launched its own Trust Project, hiring a transparency reporter, Kenyon Wallace, whose beat is the newsroom; each week he picks a topic and interviews reporters about how they cover it. So far topics have included how the paper covers politics, how the science reporter vets scientific claims, and how the restaurant critic reviews new eateries. Back in January, Star reporters and editors participated in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on Reddit, in which readers queried them on issues ranging from the paper’s corrections policies to how it covers outrageous candidates like Toronto’s late mayor Rob Ford.

That effort was driven by the younger journalists, says English, despite qualms by her and other veteran colleagues. “I didn’t know what to expect and whether there might be some ugly trolling—and there was a little bit,” she says. To keep the conversation civil, however, the paper had an experienced moderator approve comments and make sure questions didn’t get out of hand. The Star’s transparency efforts may be working; according to the Edelman Trust Barometer, trust of journalism rose 10 points in Canada over the past year, to 61 percent. While she says the Star can’t take complete credit for it, as one of the country’s biggest newspapers, it may have had something to do with it.

More outlets are experimenting with social media as a way to create communities for subscribers to interact directly with reporters and staff. The Dallas Morning News created a special Facebook group in September for subscribers only, where they can ask reporters and editors about decisions the paper has made; it’s now up to 1,400 members. “We wanted to get to know them and for them to get to know us as a way to overcome some of the mistrust that sometimes exists,” says engagement editor Hannah Wise.

Wise was worried initially that the group would be one big forum for complaints. But having discussions play out in public has given the paper a way to show it cares and correct misunderstandings. When one reader complained about not having his paper delivered, editor in chief Mike Wilson jumped in to make sure he got a replacement. When a headline was incorrect, some subscribers complained the paper didn’t have copyeditors anymore. “It was late at night, and I said, we do have copyeditors, they are still here right now trying to do work—you are welcome to meet them,” says Wise.

In other cases, admitting mistakes has led to more open dialogue. When a reporter was covering an issue of separation of church and state in a nearby suburb, she inadvertently used the word “crusade,” which readers pushed back on as an unfair use of a religious term. The reporter admitted that she hadn’t intended to use the word in that way, and would be more careful in the future. “Since then, the person who has given her the most grief has ‘liked’ every story she’s written,” Wise says.

In another case, some readers were upset by a weekend guide featuring a gay couple on the cover. Wise explained to the group that the paper’s role was to reflect the community, and not censor things some readers might not agree with. “We let the community have the discussion, and I was heartened to see that the majority of the group said, how can you say this about people who love each other?”

In addition to inviting readers virtually into the newsroom, some publications have even gone so far as to invite them in physically as well. City Bureau, a nonprofit news organization in Chicago, hosts a “public newsroom” every Thursday night, in which reporters offer talks and workshops on their investigative reporting processes and solicit public advice and contributions.

Matt DeRienzo took that a step further as Connecticut statewide editor for Digital First Media, opening up a “newsroom café” to the public that was part coffee shop, part community center, and part library where people could peruse the publication’s archives. “The Little League and the Garden Club would meet right inside our newsroom,” DeRienzo says. Over time, having community members in the newsroom resulted in giving journalists more sources and perspectives they could work into stories, adding more nuance and complexity.

As much as the online environment has eroded trust and created the need for more transparency, it also offers unique tools to increase transparency

At the same time the publication was physically inviting people into the newsroom, it was also aggressively soliciting feedback on the web through its corrections policy. Rather than just posting corrections when errors were made, the site included a box prominently placed on every story that asked the community to fact-check articles, and contact the reporter through a form if anything was incorrect. In addition to correcting errors, readers often wrote in with missing information and additional perspective that reporters sometimes worked into other stories. “People don’t assume you are open to that unless you tell them,” says DeRienzo, who is now executive director of Local Independent Online News (LION) Publishers. “It led to a lot more context and accuracy.” For publications considering increasing transparency, the decision takes forethought and planning. “It’s a lot of work and very resource-intensive,” says Wikimedia’s Kramer. She recommends publications think first about their reasons for wanting to be more transparent, whether it’s to acquire deeper sources, improve trust with readers, or create more engagement about local issues, and then choose the elements of transparency likely to further those goals. However it’s implemented, she says, the push has to come from the top, and be tied to clear performance goals for employees so they have an incentive to spend the extra effort. “It has to be something management supports and creates a structure for,” she says.

For journalists used to keeping their decisions on what to include and not include in stories to themselves, opening up what they do to such scrutiny can be disconcerting to say the least. “It makes journalists uncomfortable sometimes, because they feel like it is making them a part of the story rather than being able to hide what we do,” says the Democracy Fund’s Stearns. Journalists spend a lot of time and care crafting their stories to give them the proper balance and serve an interpreting function for the audiences—exposing processes and source material can be nerve-racking.

“Those fears are absolutely legitimate,” says Stearns. “It’s a scary thing, and I totally honor and respect that. The question for me is not should we do it or shouldn’t we, but when should we do it?” Just because a publication embraces transparency doesn’t mean that reporters have to post interviews and notes for every story. Publications should be strategic, say advocates, choosing stories to start that might be important or controversial, such as investigative stories or enterprise journalism exposing an issue of pressing local concern. “It may feel risky,” says Stearns, “but it will also make you unimpeachable.”

1270,"President-elect Donald Trump gave a direct order to dismiss the son of Retired General Michael Flynn from the transition team, after the young man came under fire for spreading the discredited 'Pizzagate' conspiracy theory on Twitter.

Sources told CNN's Jake Tapper that it was Trump who did the deed, after aides in the transition had reportedly requested a security clearance for Michael Flynn Jr.

This afternoon, Vice President-elect Mike Pence revised remarks he had made earlier in the day, admitting that Flynn's son was involved in transition effort and vaguely confirming that a security clearance could have gone Flynn's way.

'I said this morning that his son had no involvement in the transition,' Pence told Tapper. 'I talked to Gen. Flynn and his son was helping him a bit with scheduling and administrative items, but that's no longer the case.'

The elder Flynn is slated to become President-elect Donald Trump's national security advisor in the White House.

The younger Flynn, Mike Flynn Jr., did not endorse the conspiracy theory, but predicted that it won't go away.

'Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many ""coincidences"" tied to it,' he tweeted on Sunday.

He mentions the presidential transition's website on his Twitter biography. CNN reported that his current email address is linked with the transition.

Tapper repeatedly asked Pence about the request for a security clearance, pointing out that, as the head of the transition, he would be privy to such knowledge.

Finally, his last effort paid off with Pence answering: 'Well, what I can tell you in talking to Gen. Flynn today, he made me aware that his son was assisting him in scheduling meetings.'

'And whatever the appropriate paperwork was to assist in that regards Jake, I'm sure it was taking place,' Pence answered.

'But that's no longer the case and your viewers and the American people can be confident that we're going to drive forward,' the vice president-elect answered.

Earlier today on Morning Joe, the vice president-elect insisted that Flynn Jr. had 'no involvement' in the presidential transition – even though he has a '.gov' email address associated with the transition effort.

'General Flynn's son has no involvement in the transition whatsoever,' Pence said on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' program, adding: 'No, no he's not [involved].'

Trump spokesman Jason Miller had told reporters during a Tuesday morning conference call that 'the younger Michael Flynn was helping his father with some administration and scheduling duties early on in the process process, and he is no longer involved with transition efforts.'

These are the same duties that Pence told Tapper about later in the day.

Miller ignored a question about whether Flynn Jr. had been fired, and didn't say when the separation occured.

It suggests that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta, her presidential campaign chairman, presided over a child-sex ring run out of a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor.

Police say a 28-year-old North Carolina man opened fire with a rifle inside the restaurant on Sunday because he thought child sex-slaves were being held against their will in the basement.

No one was harmed but the man was arrested.

On Morning Joe, Pence also defended Housing and Urban Development secretary-designate Dr. Ben Carson against charges that he's unqualified and unprepared for the job.

'He is the most humble brain surgeon I've ever met in his life. He's a brilliant man who has incredible personal faith, an incredible story and character,' Pence said.

He insisted that Carson is 'absolutely qualified – and more than that. He's going to bring to life the president-elect's vision of really bringing real renewal to urban America.'

And Pence suggested that former Vice President Al Gore's meeting with Donald and Ivanka Trump on Monday doesn't indicate a softening of the president-elect's past criticism of global warming theories.

Federal authorities were looking for a man Saturday for questioning in an arson fire at a Washington pizzeria known for being a target of conspiracy theorists.

The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives circulated imagery of a man taken from security video following the Wednesday night fire at the Comet Ping Pong pizza shop in Washington.

""ATF is seeking the pictured suspect for questioning,"" the agency tweeted.

Vito Maggiolo, spokesman for the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, said pizzeria employees had extinguished the fire by the time firefighters arrived. No injuries were reported.

""It involved some curtains in the rear of the restaurant,"" Maggiolo said. ""It was a deliberately set fire.""

A task force comprised of the ATF, the city fire department and the Metropolitan Police Department was investigating, he said. He called the man wanted for questioning a ""person of interest.""

It wasn't clear if the fire was connected to conspiracy theories that have dogged the eatery.

In 2016, Comet was targeted by some users of Reddit and 4chan discussion groups online who said a child sex ring was being operated out of the business' basement.

The business does not have a basement. Conspiracy theorists posted that readers could uncover a child sex ring in the hacked emails of John Podesta — if only one were to replace words like “pizza” with “little girl.”

Podesta casually knows the owner of Comet and once mentioned a fundraiser for President Obama at the restaurant.

The ""Pizzagate"" conspiracies were widely seen as a prelude to the blossoming of a community of online conspiracy theorists known as Qanon.

On Dec. 4, 2017 Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, traveled from North Carolina to Washington to rescue sex trafficking victims he believed were being held at the restaurant. He brought an AR-15 rifle and a .38 caliber handgun with him and opened fire on a door he couldn't open, authorities said. No one was injured.

He was later convicted of federal and local weapons charges.

210,"Consider him the elephant not in the room, simultaneously absent from this picture and looming over it.

Donald Trump did not attend Saturday’s funeral of Barbara Bush in Houston, Texas. Reporters were told that was because Trump generously wanted to spare the mourning Bush family the “disruptions due to added security” that would have come with his presidential presence. But that same White House statement may well have given the game away when it added that Trump did not attend “out of respect for the Bush family and friends attending the service”. Normally, the way you pay your respects to a grieving family is to show up, not stay away. Unless, of course, you know that the bereaved family in question hates your guts – in which case the greatest courtesy you can pay them in their hour of distress is to leave them alone.



Which might explain the unstated emotion that seems to join everyone in this picture. It’s an unusual group photo: they’re not family, they’re not friends, and they’re not a team. Rather, the official connection between them is that they have all lived in the country’s most important residence, whether as president or first lady – or in Hillary Clinton’s case, having attempted the double. They are there to honour the missing member of this exclusive club, the woman whose death has brought them to this moment. (The only living members missing are Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, who were travelling.)



The warmth between them – Republican George W Bush with arms around both his wife and Democrat Hillary – is the camaraderie you often see between one-time partisan rivals now bonded by having shared a rare and extraordinary experience. (You see something similar in those pictures of duelling heavyweight boxers reunited in retirement.) But there’s something else too.



The picture is not sombre, even though this is a funeral. Obama and Bill Clinton are smiling broadly; W has that lopsided grin that suggests he’s cracked one of his fratboy jokes. They seem relaxed. And the source of that relaxation? Could it possibly be their collective relief that Trump is not there?



That, surely, is the one thing this group can agree on. Bush Sr revealed last year that he voted for Hillary in 2016 rather than back the official Republican nominee whom he’d dismissed as a “blowhard”. Bush Jr said he left his ballot blank. Neither of them ever endorsed Trump, who had mocked son/brother Jeb Bush as “low energy” and whom Barbara herself had condemned as a “comedian”, a “showman” and an appalling sexist. Bushes, Clintons, Obamas: all have their own reasons to despise the Donald. He denied Hillary her dream; he claimed Barack Obama was not born in the US; he is the very opposite of a Bush Republican.



Which leaves Melania. Shouldn’t she be uncomfortable among all these people who despise her husband? What explains her apparent ease, smiling as readily as the rest of them?



The clue might be in some of the other pictures taken at Saturday’s service. There she was, seated next to Barack Obama, looking positively cheery. “Have you ever, ever, EVER seen Melania smile like this, and look this relaxed, beside her own husband? Ever?,” tweeted the science writer Steve Silberman. Others noted the oddity that here was the first lady looking happier than she had in ages – at a funeral.



There is indeed no shortage of pictures of Melania looking miserable or ignored by Trump, as he walks up or down the stairs of Air Force One without her, not showing his wife even the most basic courtesy, let alone marital affection. Compared to the hostile environment that is a Trump marriage, a moment with the real-life presidents’ club must have felt like blissful respite.",mainstream,M1d15b,illuminati; pizzagate
1088,"Six Russian diplomats have died in the last 60 days. As Axios notes, all but one died on foreign soil. Some were shot, while other causes of death are unknown. Note that a few deaths have been labeled “heart attacks” or “brief illnesses.”

1. You probably remember Russia’s Ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov — he was assassinated by a police officer at a photo exhibit in Ankara on December 19.

2. On the same day, another diplomat, Peter Polshikov, was shot dead in his Moscow apartment. The gun was found under the bathroom sink but the circumstances of the death were under investigation. Polshikov served as a senior figure in the Latin American department of the Foreign Ministry.

3. Russia’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, died in New York this past week. Churkin was rushed to the hospital from his office at Russia’s UN mission. Initial reports said he suffered a heart attack, and the medical examiner is investigating the death, according to CBS.

4. Russia’s Ambassador to India, Alexander Kadakin, died after a “brief illness January 27, which The Hindu said he had been suffering from for a few weeks.

5. Russian Consul in Athens, Greece, Andrei Malanin, was found dead in his apartment January 9. A Greek police official said there was “no evidence of a break-in.” But Malanin lived on a heavily guarded street. The cause of death needed further investigation, per an AFP report. Malanin served during a time of easing relations between Greece and Russia when Greece was increasingly critiqued by the EU and NATO.

6. Ex-KGB chief Oleg Erovinkin, who was suspected of helping draft the Trump dossier, was found dead in the back of his car December 26, according to The Telegraph. Erovinkin also was an aide to former deputy prime minister Igor Sechin, who now heads up state-owned Rosneft.

If we go back further than 60 days.

7. On the morning of U.S. Election Day, Russian diplomat Sergei Krivov was found unconscious at the Russian Consulate in New York and died on the scene. Initial reports said Krivov fell from the roof and had blunt force injuries, but Russian officials said he died from a heart attack. BuzzFeed reports Krivov may have been a Consular Duty Commander, which would have put him in charge of preventing sabotage or espionage.

8. In November 2015, a senior adviser to Putin, Mikhail Lesin, who was also the founder of the media company RT, was found dead in a Washington hotel room according to the NYT. The Russian media said it was a “heart attack,” but the medical examiner said it was “blunt force injuries.”

9. If you go back a few months prior in September 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s driver was killed too in a freak car accident while driving the Russian President’s official black BMW to add to the insanity.

If you include these three additional deaths that’s a total of nine Russian officials that have died over the past 2 years that WeAreChange.com’s Aaron Kesel knows of – he notes there could be more.

As Kesel explains, it’s worth noting that governments, specifically the CIA, have for long periods of time had chemical concoctions that can induce a full systematic shutdown of a person’s nervous system and in some cases cause someone’s’ heart to explode.

Former CIA employee Mary Embree discusses the infamous heart attack gun and how she was tasked with finding a chemical concoction that would cause a heart attack. The weapon was first made public during the Church Committee hearings in 1975 by former CIA director William Colby. It was said to be very lethal and untraceable, by using this weapon a murder is made to look natural while the poison dissolves in hours.

“Turkey and Russia have the will not to be deceived by this false flag attack,” they said.

Don’t forget that on Christmas day, a Russian military jet went down over the Black Sea, killing 60 members of the Red Army choir and 33 others that just adds to the massive coincidence list.

On a final note, former acting director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Michael Morell openly conspired to “covertly” kill Russians and Iranians in Syria in an August 2016 interview with Charlie Rose.While Morell was talking about killing Russian and Iranian soldiers it is definitely a strange piece to add to this puzzle.",conspiracy,C03660,pizzagate
1318,"Before Keane-Vieira and Pizzagate came the Battle of Old Trafford — a 21-man brawl, sparked by Brian McClair kicking Nigel Winterburn on the floor, which saw Arsenal and Manchester United docked points and started three decades of hostility.

Those involved in the October 1990 episode were indeed from a different era, from alpha-male managers Sir Alex Ferguson and George Graham to on-pitch warriors like Tony Adams, Mark Hughes and Steve Bruce. How supporters would love the current United and Arsenal teams to have some of that, instead of watching a couple of underachieving Europa League sides face each other on a Monday night.

‘I’d been fascinated by Alex coming down to England. I knew about his success at Aberdeen and was desperate to see off this new challenger,’ says Graham, reflecting on the start of the rivalry.

‘As Scots, we were very welcoming to each other in personal terms, but extremely passionate about doing the best for our clubs. I remember Alex being so keen to rebuild United he tried to get all the best kids from the south.

‘This particular game, the stakes were high because we were unbeaten and pumped up. We did win 1-0, but the flare-up turned it into a nightmare and we were deducted two points. Luckily, we were good enough to win the league anyway!’ Ferguson was so impressed by the instinct of Arsenal’s players to wade in and help their mates, it became a blueprint for his future success.

The glory days have gone for both teams following the departures of Ferguson and Arsene Wenger. Graham, who played for United as well as winning the league and cup Double for Arsenal, can’t offer much immediate comfort. ‘I can’t see either challenging at the top for three seasons at least,’ he said. ‘Even the top four will be tough for them right now. When standards slip, it’s hard to raise them again, and Liverpool and Manchester City aren’t going anywhere.

‘People talk about a lack of leaders and they have a point, particularly at centre-half. Think about Tony Adams, John Terry, Vincent Kompany, Virgil van Dijk. Every Arsenal supporter wants a defender like that. United have been looking for years. They’ve signed Harry Maguire and hope he’s the answer. But that’s the word: “hoping”.

‘United are under greater pressure because expectations there are higher, both for results and the style of play. It could be a good time for Arsenal to play them.’

Graham is an Arsenal legend. His six major trophies as manager between 1986 and 1995 included two championships, a domestic cup double and European glory.

Less celebrated was his spell at United, signing for Tommy Docherty in 1972 as the club struggled after Sir Matt Busby. They were relegated in Graham’s only full season.

‘There are comparisons to now, although United obviously won’t go down,’ Graham says. ‘Tommy was trying to buy new players but it takes time as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is finding out.

‘I like the look of Dan James, quick, strong, lovely shot. Scouts, or the recruitment department as they are called these days, should look at the lower leagues more. I signed Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and Steve Bould from smaller clubs and they became part of Arsenal’s history. I know you can go anywhere in the world now to buy players, but the principle still stands.’

Graham goes to The Emirates occasionally and watched the recent 2-2 draw with Spurs. He’s not met Unai Emery, but spots a similarity with his own management style.

‘Emery isn’t afraid to make decisions,’ Graham, now 74, says. ‘If he thinks Mesut Ozil should come off, he’s off. I like that, it’s the job.

‘I sold Charlie Nicholas who had done his stretch. If the team is struggling, make a decision and if you upset anyone, so what?

‘I’m told the passion is back at the training ground, which is good. But you do need quality as well. There’s not many in the current Arsenal team I’d have taken. The forward line is clearly the strongest part of their team.’

Graham has been invited to a tribute dinner for Wenger. The pair live close to each other, with the Frenchman’s house backing on to Graham’s favourite local golf course. Wenger himself is coming up to 70 and while Graham refers to him as ‘the most successful manager in Arsenal’s history’, he can’t see anything coming from his successor’s recent description of United being a dream job.

‘It’s too late for something like that,’ says Graham. ‘Arsene was fantastic but I believe in the philosophy: “Enjoy your time in football because it will come to an end”.’

Graham retired at 56 after being sacked by Spurs. Having spent years climbing the coaching ladder at Crystal Palace, QPR and Millwall before reaching the top, he didn’t have the motivation to work at a more modest level.

Nearly 20 years later, Graham confesses to a feeling of unfinished business. ‘I was always better at working players without the ball than the attacking part of the game. I would have tried to rectify the balance if I’d carried on — I wanted to,’ he says.

‘I was very single-minded. After we won the league at Anfield (in 1989), I was thinking within seconds about my press conference and what I was going to say. Now, I look at the footage and think: “Why didn’t you show a bit of emotion?”’

His study at his Hampstead Heath home is filled with pictures of family and Graham himself with various trophies. ‘I always said the only way to drink champagne was out of a silver cup,’ he smiles.

One of the most prominent photos shows him walking out at Wembley with his good friend Terry Venables before the 1991 Arsenal-Spurs FA Cup semi-final, famous for Gazza’s stunning free-kick. ‘I owe Terry a lot and still speak to him today. He offered me a coaching job at Palace after I’d broken my leg. I loved it, took to it like a duck to water.’

He’ll support Arsenal on Monday night, but hopes both his former clubs get it right. ‘United will have money to spend. Arsenal will struggle to find the same money. Emery will have to try and improve the players he’s got. For both him and Solskjaer, it’s a waiting game.

“All Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That’s why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens….

……we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.”

849,"July of 2018 will surely go down in history as the month that Pedogate was blown wide open by the CIA’s Mockingbird Media.

Remember: where “Pizzagate is Local, Pedogate is Global”. In other words, every nation on Earth has its own version of Pedogate taking place within its borders 24/7.

That’s because Pedogate was set up centuries ago as a control mechanism used to coerce and influence every government official, political leader, corporate officer, civil society VIP, etc. who needed to be kept on a short leash. The following extended essay well delineates the most important details on Pedogate.

Whereas Brussels, Belgium is the current capital of the Pedogate global crime syndicate, Great Britain is perhaps the most powerful international franchise. No one controls the planet like the Brits do with all their spying and surveillance technologies and techniques which began with the beginning of the British Empire. Given the extraordinary technological advancements since the founding of the British East India Company in 1600, it’s no wonder that London has been used to oversee and administer the planetary civilization for the Black Nobility.

With this basic understanding, it ought to be quite clear that the Global Control Matrix is now breaking up in real-time. When the MSM runs such a radioactive exposé it can only mean the end is near…VERY NEAR indeed!

N.B. The following article offers just a glimpse into the unprecedented revelations contained in the scorching YouTube video posted above.

60 Minutes’ explosive 19 July feature, “Spies, Lords and Predators”, reported that the recent blizzard of revelations of paedophile rings operating among the elite of the British Establishment constitutes the “biggest political scandal Britain has ever faced”. Presenter Ross Coulthart stated right at the show’s outset, “There is a paedophile gang operating at the highest levels of the British Establishment” (his emphasis), and, although 60 Minutes did not dwell on the point, that includes the Royal Family itself. However the Royal involvement shone through in an 18 July article by the UK’s ExaroNews, which 60 Minutes credited as a co-producer of its show, while a 24 June press release by the CEC had been even more explicit in naming the Royals.

60 Minutes reported the first-hand allegations of a number of child abuse survivors, who identified the prominent Establishment figures who abused them when they were children in the 1970s and 80s.

One survivor, Richard Kerr, fell victim to this paedophile ring as a nine-year-old in the 1970s, when he was sent to the Kincora Boys Home in Belfast, Northern Ireland, run by notorious paedophiles. From Kincora, Kerr, like many others, was trafficked all over the UK to be abused by powerful men. To 60 Minutes, he identified among his abusers former member of parliament Cyril Smith, and former deputy head of MI6 Sir Peter Hayman. The latter was a member of an organised gang called the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which campaigned openly in the 1970s for the age of consent to be lowered to as young as four.

The CEC’s 24 June release also identified the paedophile ring operating out of the Kincora boys’ home, in connection with the murder gangs that British intelligence coordinated in Northern Ireland, under the command of Brigadier General Frank Kitson, to orchestrate terrorism and civil war. Though his troops opened fire on unarmed civilians in the infamous “Bloody Sunday” massacre of 30 January 1972, killing 13 civilians and wounding 13 more, the Crown showered honour after honour upon him, including an OBE for his work in Northern Ireland, while the Queen personally inducted him into her ultra-elite Order of the Bath. Still alive, he retired in 1982 as Commander-in-Chief, UK Land Forces. The CEC release emphasised the unique significance of the Kincora story:

“Despite pleas from many quarters to do so, British Home Secretary Theresa May has staunchly refused to include the Kincora case in the new child abuse inquiry to be headed by New Zealand Judge Lowell Goddard, even though the present, local inquiry in Northern Ireland into Kincora under Anthony Hart QC lacks the legal powers to compel crucial witnesses to testify. Why the steadfast refusal to include Kincora? Because there is abundant evidence now even in the public domain that MI5, MI6 and other British intelligence agencies know that not only was one of Kitson’s paramilitary ‘pseudo-gangs’ (Tara) at the centre of that affair, but that other, leading members of the British establishment were personally involved in the abuse, including Lord Mountbatten himself, Surveyor of the Queen’s Pictures Sir Anthony Blunt, and numerous other high society figures from Ireland and England.”

60 Minutes did not name these individuals, but ExaroNews in its 18 July article reported that Richard Kerr had identified some of the same figures which the CEC had:

“Among those who were part of the cover-up of a paedophile network linked to Kincora boys’ home in Belfast, Northern Ireland, according to Kerr, were:
• Lord Mountbatten, a cousin of the Queen, great-uncle to Prince Charles, chief of the defence staff from 1959 to 1965 …;
• Sir Maurice Oldfield, director of the Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6;
• Sir Anthony Blunt, master of the Queen’s pictures, former officer in the Security Service, or MI5, who became a Russian spy;
• Sir Knox Cunningham, Unionist/Ulster Unionist MP, parliamentary private secretary to Harold Macmillan as prime minister, and member of the Conservative party’s national executive committee 1959-66. …

“An intelligence source told Exaro that Mountbatten mixed with paedophiles who went to parties in the Republic of Ireland. Mountbatten is also understood to have visited Kincora, although why remains unclear.”

It was very clear to the CEC, who had named Mountbatten himself as a paedophile in its 24 June release. Among other things, Mountbatten had welcomed the notorious paedophile Jimmy Savile into the Royal family, and he became a regular at Buckingham Palace and a mentor and advisor to Prince Charles. According to British press accounts, Savile molested as many as 1000 children, many of them helpless patients in hospitals. He was also, according to some accounts, a necrophiliac, who proclaimed that the 5 days he had spent alone with his mother after her death were the “happiest days of my life.”

60 Minutes also identified as a high-ranking paedophile one of Margaret Thatcher’s many paedophile protégés, Sir Leon Brittan, whom she appointed Home Secretary and whose department was responsible for investigating, and therefore covering up, paedophile complaints. Brittan, for instance, “lost” extensive documentation on high-level paedophilia presented to him by MP Geoffrey Dickens in the early 1980s. 60 Minutes also named Lord Greville Janner, a sitting member of the House of Lords who until recently the Public Prosecutor had declined to prosecute on the grounds of his claimed dementia, even though he had voted in Parliament over 200 times since the onset of his alleged mental debility. 60 Minutes also interviewed a member of PIE, which gave the viewer a skin-crawling glimpse into the mindset that openly justifies, in fact promotes, the sexual exploitation of children.

The UK authorities have covered up this paedophile network for decades, because it exists at the dark heart of where real power is wielded in Britain’s anti-democratic, elitist system—in the Crown itself. This scandal threatens the entire British oligarchical power structure, and there are already indications that the Goddard inquiry into the scandal will simply continue the cover-up, as demonstrated by present Home Secretary Theresa May’s refusal to include the Kincora Boys Home in the inquiry, which would expose the overlap between the paedophile networks and MI6/MI5 and the Royals. A cover-up was also signalled by Goddard’s forecast that the inquiry would take 5-10 years to conclude—the typical British Establishment ploy to drag such things out until the uproars which caused them have died down and key witnesses have disappeared, died, or been terrorised into silence.

60 Minutes indicated its intention to follow up on its explosive report. But if you really want to get to the bottom (or the top!) of this Satanic evil which permeates the British Establishment, stay tuned for more revelations from the CEC.

451,"In the summer of 1990, I was running a pretty weird nightclub in the Roppongi neighborhood of Tokyo. I was deeply immersed in the global cyberpunk scene and working to bring the Tokyo node of this fast-expanding, posthuman, science-fiction-and-psychedelic-drug-fueled movement online. The Japanese scene was more centered around videogames and multimedia than around acid and other psychedelics, and Timothy Leary, a dean of ’60s counterculture and proponent of psychedelia who was always fascinated with anything mind-expanding, was interested in learning more about it. Tim anointed the Japanese youth, including the 24-year-old me, “The New Breed.” He adopted me as a godson, and we started writing a book about The New Breed together, starting with “tune in, turn on, take over,” as a riff off Tim’s original and very famous “turn on, tune in, drop out.” We never finished the book, but we did end up spending a lot of time together.

824,"Alysa Turner loves theater and Tumblr. Both came in handy this week when she inadvertently became embroiled in a political social-media firestorm.

Turner was at a family event last Saturday when she heard that White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked to leave a Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Va. on Friday night. Sanders tweeted about the incident, which set off another Trump-era social media frenzy.

The good news: Sanders specified that she was asked to leave the Red Hen in Lexington, Va. and Turner is the public relations manager for the Red Hen in Washington, D.C. It’s a restaurant with the same name, but it has no affiliation to the Virginia Red Hen. The bad news: The Twitterverse didn’t seem to know or care.

“The day it happened was unfortunate,” she told MarketWatch. “I was at a graduation party for one of my cousins who’s like a brother to me. I love him dearly. I had my phone in my hand the entire time.”

She spent the day trying to get the message across that there are many restaurants with the name Red Hen. And given that her restaurant is based in D.C., it was a prime target on Twitter TWTR, .

Her first priority: Protect her company’s brand. Sanders was asked to leave a different Red Hen over 180 miles away. And she did.

But when it became clear that the Twitter trolls kept coming and tagging her restaurant’s Twitter handle @redhendc, Turner decided to drop her usual neutral tone and use more of her own voice and that of the owner and chef, Michael Friedman, in the restaurant’s tweets. “Once people said, ‘I don’t believe you, you’re a liar.’ That’s when I injected my own humor. Mike was, like, ‘Good job, keep going.’”

Here are some of her most effective (yet polite) tweets:

It helps that Turner has a background in entertainment. She been working in PR since she graduated from Ithaca College in 2011 and started out in entertainment PR. She grew up in the Adirondack foothills in upstate New York and lived in Chicago before moving to D.C.

Things quieted down on Sunday and, on Monday, President Trump tweeted derogatory comments about Red Hen, but didn’t specify which Red Hen. So the angry tweets found new momentum.

Turner has found herself in a very modern dilemma, one that’s not so unusual for 2018 when entertainment, politics and social media mix, often with unpredictable results. “I guess it’s a crisis,” she says, “it’s a crisis of misinformation. We didn’t do anything.”

“The restaurant has a specific voice that I’ve used for a year and a half without issue. All day Saturday, we kept it in our voice and kept it pretty professional.”

On Monday, when the tweets intensified, Turner drew on her Tumblr experiences and ramped up the humor. “This is the day the kids on Tumblr have been training me for,” Turner says. So Tumblr can get rough and tumble? “Not rough and tumble. They’re all very witty.”

She added, “We’re about a mile from the Capitol Building, so we’ve had people from both sides of the aisle here. There is a statute in D.C. that you cannot discriminate based on political affiliation. I tweeted that out a couple of times too.”

But Turner is also aware of the “pizzagate” shooting at Comet Ping Pong, another D.C. restaurant where fake news on social media in 2016 almost ended in a fatality. Police officers have been stationed at night outside the Red Hen that Turner works, and the police have been driving by and keeping an eye on the place during the day.

“I want to protect my client,” Turner said. “This is an owner operated restaurant. And I want to protect all of our employees from a safety standpoint. The restaurant industry is very small, and we are wary, and rightly so.’”

In the meantime, she’s hoping the furor will die down. “We’re a Michelin Guide restaurant. We’re always on the top of the list for best restaurants. We were doing great before.” Some people, however, have threatened to disrupt the business and tweeted that they would make fake reservations. “We typically book up a solid month in advance,” Turner said. “A lot of people can’t even get a real reservation.”",mainstream,M0ca16,pizzagate
785,"Now that President-elect Donald J. Trump has started firing people for spreading fake news, let’s hope he doesn’t stop at one.

On Tuesday, he canned transition team member Michael G. Flynn for taking to Twitter to keep alive the false “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory — involving a believable combination of child sex slaves, a pizzeria and Hillary Clinton — even after it led to a vigilante shooting last weekend inside a Washington D.C. restaurant. (“The intel on this wasn’t 100 percent,” the gunman told the New York Times on Wednesday. Ya think?)

Next up should be Vice President-elect Mike Pence for claiming Mr. Flynn wasn’t part of the Trump transition team, followed by Mr. Flynn’s father, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn. The elder Flynn is Mr. Trump’s pick for national security adviser, and he’s as bad as his son when it comes to misusing social media — endorsing alt-right figures and disparaging Muslims on Twitter and passing along bogus claims about, among other things, Hillary Clinton being headed to jail and plans for a one world church banning Christianity.

And then, of course, Mr. Trump will have to let himself go.

A sample of his misinformation, according to Politifact:
• Millions of people voted illegally in the presidential election. (No they didn’t.)
• African-American communities are in the “worst shape they’ve ever been in.” (One word: slavery.)
• There are no chess grandmasters in the U.S. (We have 90.)
• He “finished” the Obama birther controversy. (Try “furthered it.”)
• “Inner-city crime is reaching record levels.” (Violent crime in cities has been cut in half since the mid-1990s.)
• “We don’t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion.” (She’s a long-practicing Methodist.)
• Ted Cruz’s father “was with Lee Harvey Oswald” before the assassination of President JFK. (This is based on a National Enquirer story; need I say more?)

The irony here, of course, is that while it’s never been easier to disseminate wild claims — fake election news stories were actually shared far more than real news stories on Facebook in the three months prior to Election Day — it’s also never been easier to debunk them. If employing common sense and critical thinking skills aren’t enough, there are dozens of websites devoted to fact-checking the latest viral rumors. (Here are some about Mr. Obama we’d like to put to bed: He’s not buying a vacation house in Dubai; he hasn’t signed an executive order banning the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools; and he did not, unfortunately, ban fake news sites post-election)

But Mr. Trump apparently hasn’t learned the finer details of using Google to check his “facts.”

And then there are the statements he makes that we can’t yet classify as real or fake. Does he really want to cancel the Boeing contract for a new Air Force One, or is tweeting so just a strategy to get a discount on the price? Are flag burners truly in jeopardy of losing their citizenship or spending a year in jail despite First Amendment protections, as he said they should be? And is he indeed planning to “terminate” the Cuba deal Mr. Obama cut if it’s not improved in our favor?

He appears to float random ideas to gauge public reaction, like throwing spaghetti at a wall to see if it sticks. “I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I’ve gotten to know him well — he’s a greatly talented person who loves people!” he tweeted on Nov. 22. Nearly two weeks later, after relatively little backlash (likely owing to the Thanksgiving holiday), he made it official.

He raised the idea of Mitt Romney as secretary of state weeks ago but has delayed making a decision as his allies trash the former Massachusetts governor, who famously railed against Mr. Trump during the campaign.

Then again, the president-elect might just be messing with Mr. Romney and others he views as antagonistic. Why else would he meet with Al Gore — who co-won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for efforts “to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change” — only turn around a few days later and appoint a climate change denier to head the Environmental Protection Agency?

Maybe that’s what he was really up to with the Boeing tweet, which caused the company’s stock to plummet. After all, it appeared shortly after Boeing’s CEO criticized Mr. Trump’s trade policies in The Sun’s sister paper, the Chicago Tribune.

The only thing we can be sure of when it comes to Mr. Trump is that whatever he’s saying, true or false, has been crafted for one purpose: serving his personal interests, whatever they may be.

So can we believe him when he says he’ll “make America great again”? I don’t think we need to go to Snopes.com to figure out the answer to that.

297,"Fighting fake news is the new pretext given by the ruling cabal in many nations to enact censorship via the back door.

Amid the rallying cries of “We must fight fake news!” both France (under would-be dictator Macron) and now Brazil are attempting to pass legislation to ban political content on the web that the government deems to be fake news.

There is a theme to this, as it follows on from many acts of censorship in 2016 and 2017.

Whether it’s Twitter shadowbanning, Facebook rolling our fake news checkers or deleting entire accounts, YouTube embarking upon soft censorship through forced sign-ins or hard censorship by deleting entire channels, Google’s search engine hiding websites (by de-ranking them) or – worst of all – Google demonetizing content and sites not to its liking, censorship is clearly getting worse and threatening to overtake a free and open internet.

All in the Name of Fighting Fake News

The big corporations of the internet have shown their true colors on the issue of censorship vs. free speech. Amazon has been caught banning certain books from being sold on its platform, e.g. in 2015 it decided to ban Jim Fetzer’s book No One Died at Sandy Hook, which exposed the false flag mass shooting at Sandy Hook.

In reaction to the whole “Russian meddling in the US election saga”, which is itself fake news and a tempest in a teapot, Facebook decided to get tough and enlist the help of international fact checkers to do your thinking for you and decide for you what is real news and what is fake news.

Funnily enough, it was recently reported that the rollout didn’t go so well, so for the time being Facebook has canned the idea because it was making things worse!

Facebook has also been caught banning posts on certain topics (e.g. with NaturalNews.com and their posts on gun control) or even deleting entire accounts of users it didn’t like (as recently happened with David Icke, whose 700,000+ follower account just got reinstated after being down for 6 days due to an “error” – yeah right).

If fighting fake news is so important, why not ban the MSM? That should take care of most of it.

Examples of actual fake news from the mainstream media, which sometimes had absolutely horrific consequences (war, destruction, sufferance and loss of human life):

1. CNN caught producing fake news during the Gulf War

 2. CNN caught producing fake news during the Syrian conflict

 3. CNN caught producing fake news during Sandy Hook and Boston Marathon “Bombing”

 4. BBC & CNN Caught Staging FAKE News Chemical Attacks to Drag Britain into Syrian War 

 5. 4 More Examples of Mainstream Media Fabricating News to Push for War

 6. Former CNN journalist: “CNN is paid by foreign and domestic government agencies for specific content”

 7. FOX News – and all other news agencies – are ‘corporate persons’ and can LEGALLY LIE their viewers

 8. New York Times openly admits MSM stories are scripted by the White House

 9. MSM censored/ignored a shocking admission of highest level Turkish false flag against Syria, which would have triggered a war between the two nations

 10. BBC Journalist Comes Clean: ‘Believe Nothing You Read Or Watch’

Twitter is no stranger to censorship either, with its employees boasting of shadow banning (aka stealth banning, ghost banning or comment ghosting), meaning blocking a user or their content from an online community without the user realizing they have been banned.

At one point Google publicly floated the idea of deranking and delisting certain sites (they mentioned Russian sites RT and Sputnik), but they later did a U-Turn and claimed they would not be doing that.

Obviously, it is easily within their power to tamper with algorithms to include or exclude anything they want, and virtually no one would ever know the search results were being skewed due to Google’s own ideological bias. Google was caught doing this in favor of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 US presidential elections.

Indeed, after the firing of ex-Google employee James Damore (who has now initiated a class action lawsuit due to his dismissal), we have to wonder whether bias isn’t already coded into Google’s algorithms just as a result of their orthodoxy and culture (left-wing and promoting diversity at all costs).

Recently, Breitbart reported that Google’s fact-checking almost exclusively targets conservative or right wing media.

It’s not just Google itself. Google-owned YouTube has been embarking on campaigns of both soft censorship and hard censorship. In many ways, soft censorship is more insidious, because then the company can claim plausible deniability and refuse to admit they are even engaged in censorship.

In this case, soft censorship refers to when YouTube technically allows people to watch a video, but makes it difficult by putting barriers in the way, e.g. by claiming the content is “age-restricted” (forcing you to open an account, give your details to YouTube and prove that you are of mature age) or using other ways to force you to sign in before being allowed to watch the video.

The adpocalypse of 2017 as it was called was perhaps closer to hard censorship, and involved a sweeping demonetization of videos due to “inappropriate content” for advertisers. Finally, YT has actually deleted entire channels on occasion, such as the deletion of ActivistPost’s account last year in 2017.

Fighting fake news is really about the end goal of narrowing the “allowable”, “permissable” or even “legal” range of thought … censorship and perception management.

It’s Not Just Fighting Fake News; Censorship Also Thriving under Pretext of Fighting Terrorism, Fighting Hate Speech and Being Political Correct

Fighting fake news gives would-be tyrants a great excuse to censor, however free speech is also being eroded by the equally vague and nebulous concepts of terrorism and hate speech.

The term fake news rose to prominence right around the time that Donal Trump was elected in November 2016, yet there is hardly a clear and widely-agreed upon definition for the phrase.

It often gets used by people who seek to criticize information they don’t like, dismiss allegations against them, or even to defend themselves when faced with an unflattering report about themselves. As Glenn Greenwald writes:

“Yet, as many have long been warning, few people, if any, ever bothered to define what the term [fake news] actually means. As a result, it’s incredibly vague, shifting, and devoid of consistent meaning. Do any news articles that contain false, significant assertions qualify? Is there some intent requirement, and if so, what is it and how is determined (does recklessness qualify)?

“Can large mainstream outlets such as the Washington Post, Le Monde, and Globo be guilty of publishing “fake news” and thus subject to this censorship, or is it — as one expects — reserved only for small, independent blogs and outlets that lack a powerful corporate presence?

“Ill-defined terms that become popularized in political discourse are, by definition, terms of propaganda rather than reliable, meaningful indicators of problems. And invariably, they wreak all kinds of predictable havoc and inevitably give rise to abuses of power.

“More than anything else, such terms — which, by design, mean whatever the powerful groups wielding them want them to mean — so often produce arbitrary censorship in the name of combatting them. Just consider two similarly ill-defined but popular propagandistic terms — “terrorism” and “hate speech” — which have been appropriated by governments all over the world to justify the most extreme, repressive powers.”

The fake war on terror has given the West – especially the US and UK – lots of mileage to suppress its own citizens. Egypt and Saudi Arabia also jumped in on the act with censorship laws based on terrorism.

As for hate speech, it has been used to silence all sorts of opinions including those opposing Zionism and Israel’s continuous theft and murder against the Palestinians – because if you criticize Israel then you must be anti-semitic, right (even though true Judaism and Zionism are mutually exclusive)?

Political correctness is nothing but censorship at the end of the day. It is intolerance disguised as tolerance. As George Carlin said, it is fascism pretending to be manners.

There is no right “not to be offended.” It is becoming more and more ludicrous as each year passes, with groups making lists of approved and non-approved terms and insisting that people using the non-approved, “politically incorrect” terms are therefore committing microaggressions against the people who hear them.

How much more are we going to take before our range of “permissible” thoughts has been utterly diminished?

When you put all these nebulous but lethal terms together – national security, war on terror, terrorism, hate speech and fake news – it pretty much allows the government to do anything it wants to you, anytime, anywhere, including searching you, robbing you, jailing you and killing you!

Watch out anytime politicians invent a new talking point term which is vague and indefinable. That vagueness can be used against you. Fighting fake news is a joke. People are people.

As long as humans have had free will and the ability to speak or write, there has always been the possibility of people lying, omitting, distorting or making false claims. It’s part of being alive to develop your discernment and work out what is true or false.

Never allow government to pretend it can do this, for the result will always be that the ruling class filters out what its doesn’t want you to know out of self-interest and a desire for more power and control.",conspiracy,C0117f,pizzagate
826,"The Duterte government, and 90% of the Philippine population at large, continue to mock Western institutions by playing smartly in the latter’s own game, and making fun of the inconvenient facts that are just beginning to hit the headlines in the West, e.g. PizzaGate and PedoGate scandals.

Published time: 28 Mar, 2017 13:33

 The Filipino people’s “love affair” with their leader “is like a jet plane that’s just taken off” and EU critics of President Rodrigo Duterte should ‘stick to child porn’.

 That’s according to Philippines Social Welfare Assistant Secretary Lorraine Badoy who defended Duterte’s standing in Time magazine’s Top 100 Men and Women for 2017 survey, where he leads Vladimir Putin, Mark Zuckerberg, Justin Trudeau and Bill Gates. The final ‘Time 100’ list will be published on April 20.

 “Plus 9 out of 10 Filipinos right now approve of him.” She added “Wrap your dim minds around that, you clowns. Nine out of ten.”

Anyone with a “teaspoon of IQ on them” would wait for Duterte to make a “huge error” before trying to topple him, she claimed.

 “Then and only then would it be the time to let your cash flow to pay the EU idiots with galls as huge as Goodyear blimps to call for the president’s resignation,” she said, adding in Filipino that “those in the EU, just engage in online child pornography. Since that’s what you are good at.”

 The warning comes as the EU condemns Duterte’s plan to revive the death penalty for drug convictions. The European Parliament has called for an international investigation into “unlawful killings and other violations” in the Philippines linked to Duterte’s war on drugs, while Duterte has told the EU MPs to mind their own business.

Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo said that the assistant secretary’s comment was “obviously sarcastic” and she was not advocating child pornography, reported Rappler.

 “Asec Badoy loves children and cares about their welfare, so to even imply that she trivializes the issue is unfair and misleading. She is an outspoken critique of social injustice, and we have no doubt as to her stand against child pornography,” Taguiwalo said in a statement, according to InterAksyon.

 Badoy, a former human rights advocate and NGO worker, was appointed to implement medical assistance to drug addicts in rehab after her online activism caught the president’s eye.

 The Philippines banned a number of x-rated websites at the beginning of 2017 as part of a wider child-porn crackdown.

Duterte has also lashed out at the EU for telling his government to release the recently arrested Drug Queen Senator Leila Delima. He said he is ready to hang his EU critics to the nearest lamppost for their improper intervention sans appropriate facts about the senator’s case, which prompted the latter to protest and summon the Philippine ambassador to explain Duterte’s latest tirade.

What makes the 5th Columnists restless for the last 9 months is the fact that the Duterte government enjoys at least 84% satisfaction rating for its war on narcopolitics, according to the latest Pulse Asia nationwide survey.



What this all means is that the Pinoys are not taking any more BS from the EU, or the UN.

 So, if you feel like shaking and rattling the Khazarian cage, try playing here…

No one is more aware of that than news literacy professors, who teach the critical-thinking skills necessary to evaluate any piece of journalism.

We spoke with three news literacy experts who shared their advice for being a responsible news consumer. Here are seven quick things you should do to judge whether you can trust what you read.

This one seems like a no-brainer, but it's essential to actually read an article before letting it form your opinion — especially if the headline makes an outrageous claim. A recent study found that only 59% of articles shared by Twitter users have actually been clicked, suggesting that many people share links based on the headline alone.

""Clicking is a good place to start,"" Jonathan Anzalone, assistant director of Stony Brook University's Center for News Literacy, told Business Insider.

The fake news site abcnews.com.co tricked readers into thinking they were reading the real ABC News with similar branding and a nearly identical URL. BI Some purveyors of fake news choose domain names suspiciously similar to those of established news companies.

Leading the pack is the notorious abcnews.com.co, whose name and logo mimic the branding of the real ABC News. During the 2016 election, the website attracted readers with bogus stories like one claiming President Barack Obama banned the Pledge of Allegiance in schools, and another that ""quoted"" a fictional person who claimed he was paid $3,500 to protest against Donald Trump. Both stories were debunked.

""Go beyond the masthead at the top, because it's really easy to copy a brand,"" said Peter Adams, senior vice president at the News Literacy Project.

Other culprits that fail the URL test are cnn-trending.com, washingtonpost.com.co, and bloomberg.ma. Make sure the site you're on isn't an impostor.

Who is the author?

Always check the author of the news you read. If you don't recognize the name, you may want to inspect other articles by the same person to see if they're a reliable voice. Bonus points if the site provides a way to contact the author.

And if no authors are listed, ask yourself: Why don't they want to stand behind their work?

Some fake news writers pushed the debunked ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy, which alleged that Hillary Clinton campaign members were involved in a sex trafficking ring at a Washington, DC pizzeria. Associated Press/Jose Luis Magana Any factual claim in a news article should be backed up by a source. Ideally, an article will cite verifiable sources like government figures, scientific studies, court documents, and the like.

Be especially vigilant when an eyebrow-raising claim doesn't have a source to back it up, McCarthy said.

For example, take the notorious ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy, which claimed members of Hillary Clinton's campaign were involved in a child sex-trafficking ring run out of a Washington, DC pizzeria. Countless fake news pieces were written about the alleged scandal, without a shred of evidence. But do some digging, and you'll find that the entire conspiracy originated from a single unsubstantiated tweet from a white-supremacy account.

Despite the claims of one famous fake news story, Pope Francis did not endorse Donald Trump for president. Franco Origlia / Getty Images If you think you might be reading fake news, try to find an article about the same subject from different media outlets. If you can't find the story on any other site, you may have been bamboozled.

""If the article seems too good to be true, or we really want it to be true, there should be extra incentive to double-check or triple-check,"" Anzalone said.

One of the most notorious fake news stories of the election season purported that Pope Francis endorsed Trump for president — a stunning revelation. But you wouldn't find the story in The New York Times, the Associated Press, or USA Today. You'd only see it on a little-known site called WTOE 5 (or other fake news sites that copied the article verbatim).

That's because it wasn't true. If a story of that magnitude is legitimate, expect multiple news outlets to write about it.

How's the quality of the writing in the article you're reading? Are there words in all caps, or a plethora of exclamation marks? Both are rarities in the world of legitimate journalism.

How about the photos — do they appear photoshopped or doctored? That's another sign the site you're on may not be trustworthy, Anzalone said.

Official White House Photo by Pete Souza Does the article's website have an ""about us"" page, or another way to learn more about the company? Having one is a good way for a site to establish credibility and clue readers into its legitimacy.

Some fake news sites disguise themselves as local media outlets with names like ""Denver Guardian,"" ""Boston Tribune,"" and ""Dallas Star News.""

""People weren't familiar with the names of local papers outside their own cities, so they didn’t detect it,"" Adams said.

239,"KrainaGrzybowTV (English translation: Mushroomland) is a bizarre YouTube channel that has become a viral sensation in its native Poland and across the world. This is the disturbing story behind it.

I remember when I first randomly came across an episode of KrainaGrzybowTV. After about 45 seconds into it, I yelled out “NOPE”, closed my browser, and almost threw my computer out of the window. A few months later, a VC reader sent me a summary of the series and its disturbing symbolism. So I sat down and watch the entire thing. The experience left me feeling nauseated and thoroughly creeped out.

Each episode of Mushroomland is styled to look like an 80’s children’s TV show from Eastern Europe. The host of the show is Agatha, a young girl that has paper eyes over her actual eyes. Each episode begins with an “educational” theme (i.e. “How to Apple”), which then turns into a bizarre, confusing, and terrifying ordeal. Throughout the episodes, we learn that Agatha has actually been abducted by strange men and sent to a mysterious place called Mushroomland.

Rainbowland episodes were published on YouTube between 2013 and 2017, with each episode describing a different aspect of Agatha’s ordeal. The channel quickly became a viral sensation and garnered over 3 million views, a cult following … and some controversy.

Various theories have attempted to decode the meaning behind these bizarre videos. In some episodes, people saw references to an atomic war.

Other theories claim that Rainbowland is about Agatha taking hallucinogenic drugs (i.e. mushrooms) or being possessed by a demon. Others believe that the entire thing has no meaning, that it is pure nonsense and that it is just a viral marketing campaign to sell products (the soundtrack and related merchandise).

While all of these theories are probably partially true, there is much more going on in Rainbowland videos. Each episode is packed with seemingly random images that actually make sense when one understands their underlying concept: Trauma-based mind control.

Also known as Monarch Programming, the aim of trauma-based mind control is to expose victims to trauma so intense (through abuse, drugs, torture, etc.) that it causes them to dissociate from reality. While in this vulnerable state, handlers program new alter personas into the minds of their victims that can be triggered at will (for more information on Monarch Programming, read the full article here). This is exactly what happens to Agatha in Rainbowland.

In the first episode, we are introduced to the TV show “Smile Guide”, hosted by Agatha.

The fact that Agatha has her eyes covered by fake eyes is the first of many symbols directly alluding to MK programming. Indeed, as seen in previous articles on this site, this symbol represents the fact that mind-controlled slaves are blinded to reality. It is their handlers that dictate what the slaves perceive to be “reality”.

Then, we are introduced to Maggie – a cartoon squirrel who acts as a co-host. Although the squirrel seems to be “friendly”, a quick shot reveals its true nature.

Demonology is an intricate part of Monarch programming. Handlers often assign “demons” to their slaves in order to further their trauma and reinforce programming. In later episodes, we actually see how Maggie is an agent of trauma.

In the first episode, Agatha shows kids “How to Apple”. The name of each episode is phrased in an odd matter as a key word is often omitted. This reflects the confusing, nonsensical environment in which MK slaves are forced to live in.

Meanwhile, various symbolic images flash onscreen, including this one.

As we see Agatha feverishly going back and forth inside the apple with a knife, we understand that she is actually “reenacting” her own sexual abuse.

This first episode also introduces Agatha’s mother. Throughout the episodes, her mother tells her story under the cover of anonymity. Everything she says points directly to mind control.

In the first episode, the mother states that a man came to her house at midnight to take her daughter to Mushroomland, adding that “it is easy to find Mushroomland, but it’s the return that might prove a bit more difficult”.

Episode 2: How To Make From Paper

The episode begins with Agatha “glitching” and stuttering when trying to say”papieru” (Polish for paper).

The glitch might be a result of the trauma she suffered in the first episode. Throughout the series, we see a red, evil looking Agatha at random moments. MK slaves are often programmed using dualistic good/evil patterns.

Later, Agatha loses patience and tells Maggie the squirrel to “get lost, r----d”. This was not a good idea.

The “demonic” side of Maggie surfaces and does not shy away from punishing Agatha. Maggie then “makes thing better” in the creepiest way possible.

The rest of the episode is a bizarre, confusing ordeal which appears to compare Agatha’s mother to a cow. Is she being programmed to hate her mother?

The 4th episode (there is no 3rd episode) focuses on hair … in the creepiest way possible. If you’ve read previous articles on this site, you know that MK slaves often develop a bizarre, unhealthy obsession with their hair. It is not rare that, during breakdowns, they shave off their hair. The most glaring case is the 2007 Britney Spears meltdown.

The episode “How to Hair” appears to detail the psychopathic process that causes MK slaves to obsess over their hair and to develop an urge to get rid of it.

Then, all kinds of crazy stuff happens.

Meanwhile, Agatha is still hosting a kid’s show. In a segment dedicated to reading viewer mail, Agatha receives various absurd and disturbing letters.

Then Agatha’s handler makes his first appearance: Jeans Man.

Then, in a hypnotic scene, the programming takes place.

This episode appears to provide “insider” insight into how MK slaves are programmed, through psychological brainwashing and physical trauma, to hate their own hair. Like Britney Spears during her meltdown.

Later in the episode, Agatha’s mother says that neither the police, the principal, or the priest would help her find her daughter. She also receives bizarre calls from her daughter.

This episode begins with Agatha passed out. A ghostly and hairless thing emerges from her and starts talking.

Agatha then wakes up and teaches kids “how to properly telephone”. However, when the phone rings, things get very MK ULTRA.

Throughout this episode, various puzzle pieces flash on screen. Once pieced together, the puzzle reveals a bizarre picture of an unknown place. What is that about?

After the electroshock, Agatha falls down under the table and a new Agatha, who has a radically different personality, sits at her place.

This appears to be a reference to Beta Kitten programming – a sex slave alter.

Then, Maggie the demon squirrel takes Agatha to the doctor who says this:

To deflower means “To deprive a woman of her virginity”. Therefore, the scene alludes to Agatha being deflowered by her handler. For this reason, Agatha replies:

Then things get even worse. Maggie tells Agatha:

The rest of the episode is a chaotic and confusing mishmash of sounds and images, where Agatha is often seen screaming in pain and walking around in a computer-generated virtual world – a reference to dissociation.

In the final episode, Agatha says that she has a child, but she’s holding a doll. Was Agatha actually pregnant from the abuse? Does Agatha believe that the doll is an actual child?

From what when can piece together from previous episodes, Justine is a slave who did not “behave” and now she’s dead. A programming project that went wrong?

Then the demon squirrel slaps Agatha in the face.

After a hypnotic scene, influenced by Japanese cartoon TV shows from the 80s, Maggie announces to Agatha that she has found a “real Mushroomlight” and that she can now open her eyes. Will she finally be free?

We then see Agatha (with her paper eyes back on) and Maggie sitting outside and joking.

This final scene says it all. Everything that happened in the previous episodes was happening in her head … while she was in the cell. Because she’s an MK slave.

This additional episode features Agatha reading a disturbing letter she wrote to her mother.

Agatha’s mother says that she received this final letter from Mushroomland. A final, cruel taunt from extremely evil people.

What the Hell Did I Just Watch?

The least one can say is that the creator behind Mushroomland, Wiktor Stribog, has some intimate knowledge about trauma-based mind control. Other videos on his channel allude to the same concept. The video PIWNICA/CELLAR is a horrifying tale of a child traumatized by his father, combined with extremely symbolic paintings referring to mind control, satanism, and child abuse.

Mushroomland appears to have spawned other Polish YouTube channels with equally bizarre content. One of the most mind-boggling ones is Magiczny Świat Ani/The Magic World of Ania. Although the channel is still active, the episodes that have been published tell the story of the mysterious abduction of a young girl named Ania. Each episode is replete with MK symbolism and allusions to Satanic Ritual Abuse – combined with all sorts of codes, ciphers and hidden links to various social media accounts. While the channel appears to feature some ARG elements (Alternate Reality Game), some believe that it actually refers to real life abductions and murders.

Mushroomland cannot be fully explained without considering trauma-based mind control and one its key components: satanic ritual abuse. Dozens of other screenshots could have been added to explain how deeply this YouTube channel goes into this disturbing topic.

Mushroomland is part of a new wave of online entertainment that blurs the line between fiction and reality. While it addresses the topic of mind control, the hypnotic, distorted and nauseating sounds and images found in each episode causes viewers to personally experience some of its horrors. The scariest thing about Mushroomland is that those who celebrate the videos as “great art” have no idea what they are truly about.",conspiracy,C06456,pizzagate

With over 2.34 billion active users,[1] Facebook is the world’s largest social media platform.[2] People use it to share intimate information about their lives, but also to share ""fake news,"" either for a devious purpose or, perhaps more troublingly, because they assume the information is true. The 2016 ""Pizzagate"" scandal epitomized how a false Facebook post could torpedo across the internet, leading a gullible person to take up arms;[3] meanwhile, many books and articles evaluating Russia’s impact on the 2016 election underscore just how pervasive false advertisements can be.[4]

This paper explores the ""fake news"" problem and the challenges it poses for society. It explains what steps Facebook has taken to minimize the effects of fake news on its platform and the technological and philosophical challenges involved. Rather than explore policy proposals to minimize fake news, it is principally concerned with one US legal doctrine which could thwart most policy proposals outright: ""state action"" theory. It explains how state action theory might be revitalized and why such a revitalization would exacerbate fake news.

Facebook insists that it’s not a media company—yet a majority of subscribers use Facebook for news.[5] A 2016 study by Pew Research Service found that 66% of people use Facebook for news, compared with just 21% of users on YouTube and 59% on Twitter.[6] Of those who use Facebook for news, an estimated 64% are unlikely to get news from another social media site.[7]

Having a topical News Feed provides many benefits, but the consequences can be disastrous when the information is false. ""Fake news"" on Facebook is especially pernicious. Not only is the ""real identity"" of any given Facebook account easier to camouflage than a printed source, the prospect of making money through online advertising creates a powerful financial incentive to deceive.[8] Though not all Facebook users are inclined to believe, or share, false stories they see on the internet, stories gain credibility when shared online by a friend.[9]

""Fake news"" means different things to different people. Clair Wardle and Hossein Derakhshan break the term ""fake news"" into three categories: ""mis-information"" (false information shared without harmful intent); ""dis-information"" (false information shared with harmful intent); and lastly ""mal-information"" (genuine information shared to cause harm).[10] Facebook seems to apply related distinctions. In Facebook’s 2018 video, ""Facing Facts,"" data science manager, Eduardo Ariño de La Rubia, classifies online content into a four-box matrix.[11] On the x-axis, information increases by truthfulness, moving from less to more true. On the y-axis, the intention underlying the post moves from innocent to devious. Facebook’s fake news work is mostly focused on information that is in the upper left quadrant: namely, information that is ""less true"" but also ""devious"" by intention. This is what Facebook is traditionally referring to when it talks about ""disinformation"" or ""hoaxes.""[12] Nonetheless, Facebook is also concerned with propaganda (especially when coordinated by foreign governments), which falls in the upper right quadrant: ""devious"" but not necessarily untrue.[13]

Facebook’s categories illustrate how intention interacts with truth, but they obfuscate the difficulty in determining ""intention."" For example, satirical headlines from the Onion or The New Yorker’s ""Borowitz Report"" often contain false information with the goal of making an overarching ""true"" point, but not every reader necessarily regards those stories as satirical. In a story by Christian magazine, Babylon Bee, CNN reportedly purchased a giant washing machine in which to ""spin"" its stories.[14] While many readers might have understood the story was a satirical jab at the liberal media, one of the five fact-checking organizations employed by Facebook, Snopes, flagged the story as ""false.""[15]



What is Facebook doing about fake news?

The 2016 Presidential election brought our attention to the digital ""fake news"" problem. One month later, Facebook revealed its plans to address the issue of ""fakes and hoaxes"" online.[16] Since then, Facebook has introduced new products and techniques to 1) identify false content, mostly falling within the ""hoaxes"" category though sometimes extending to ""propaganda;"" 2) remove fake accounts; and 3) tighten regulation of advertisements.[17] Because much fake news is a financial effort to make money through advertising, Facebook believes the solution lies in removing the underlying financial incentives.

Facebook’s ""Community Standards"" expressly prohibit hate speech and credible incitements to violence,[18] but they don’t expressly forbid false content.[19] For example, when Facebook removed pages run by Alex Jones in 2018, they cited his hateful and bullying speech, not falsehood, as the rationale.[20] Nonetheless, while Facebook does not ""remove"" false content,[21] it tries to identify it and minimize its spread. To do so, Facebook combines self-reporting by users and third-party identification by independent fact-checkers, including Factcheck, Snopes, the Associated Press, Politifact, and the Weekly Standard.[22] Initially, Facebook flagged any story identified as false in users’ News Feeds with a ""disputed"" signal and a corresponding article that explained the decision.[23] These stories subsequently appeared lower in the News Feed, reducing views by over 80%.[24] No story flagged as ""disputed"" could be converted into an advertisement.[25] Facebook later found that the disputed signal actually entrenched deeply held beliefs and was thus counterproductive in discouraging certain media consumption.[26] In 2017, Facebook replaced the disputed signal with links to ""related articles"" whenever a user went to share a disputed post.[27] The ""related articles"" contained similar, presumably more accurate, information on the same topic. Facebook nonetheless continued to demote disputed stories and prevent disputed stories from being used for advertisements. Publishers whose stories are flagged ""false"" can contact fact-checkers for challenge or correction.[28] While it’s not public how many ""disputed"" posts external organizations identify,[29] some reports indicate that Facebook doesn’t provide its fact-checkers sufficient financial or strategic support.[30] Facebook acknowledges some ongoing challenges associated with external partners, including 1) Facebook currently lacks fact-checkers in some countries; 2) different countries have different journalism standards; and 3) ""it can take hours or even days to review a single claim.""[31] Nonetheless, Facebook has sought to amplify fact-checkers’ work through machine learning techniques, which can identify duplicates of previously debunked stories and to flag posts that replicate those messages across the internet.[32]

While Facebook’s standards don’t prohibit fake news, they do require ""authenticity""---meaning that users cannot misrepresent their identities online by using a fake account.[33] When Facebook identifies these misleading accounts, it deletes them. For example, Facebook took down a network of more than 270 pages and accounts associated with the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) because the IRA ""repeatedly used complex networks of inauthentic accounts to deceive and manipulate people who use Facebook, including before, during and after the 2016 US presidential elections.""[34] Facebook acknowledged some pages did not contain false content, but emphasized the pages’ inauthentic creation.[35] Drawing upon the Facebook’s four-part framework, these ""inauthentic"" campaigns resemble ""propaganda"" more closely than ""hoaxes."" In May 2018, Facebook released its first ""Community Standards Enforcement Report,"" which tracks Facebook’s progress in minimizing fake accounts—along with spam, violence and graphic content, adult nudity, hate speech, and terrorist propaganda.[36] In the report, Facebook estimated that approximately 3-4% of its active users have ""fake accounts.""[37] Facebook disabled 1.3 billion of those accounts in early 2018, reporting that it identified almost all of these fake accounts using its software algorithm (98.5% as of Q3), while individual users reported the remaining fake accounts.[38]

The 2016 election raised new questions about the ability of foreign actors to target Americans with political advertisements.[39] Facebook estimates that 10 million Americans saw Russia-sponsored advertisements shortly before and after the 2016 election.[40] These advertisements were about divisive political and social issues, costing only $6,700 total.[41] In April 2017, Facebook shut down a network of 47 accounts and pages believed to be operated out of Russia with the purpose of spreading fake news. Six months later, Facebook delivered 3,000 advertisements from this network to Congress.[42]

Unlike the vast majority of Facebook content, which lacks pre-publication review, Facebook analyzes advertisements before publication, using both automated and manual review, to ensure they don’t violate Facebook’s twenty-nine guidelines for prohibited content.[43] These guidelines range from straight-forward rules to complex standards related to misinformation. For example, guideline thirteen states: ""[a]ds, landing pages, and business practices must not contain deceptive, false, or misleading content, including deceptive claims, offers, or methods.""[44] Unlike its rules for normal posts, Facebook distinguishes between political and non-political advertisements.[45] In 2017, Facebook enhanced its authenticity requirements for anyone paying to run election-related ads on Facebook, requiring that they disclose their identities and locations.[46] In 2018, Facebook extended the disclosure requirement to anyone who wanted to show politically charged ""issue ads,""[47] with a specific list of issues tailored by country.[48] Facebook’s policy allegedly applies to ads that take a position on those issues so to influence public debate, promote ballot measures, or elect candidates.[49]

Overall, Facebook’s success is mixed. A study by New York University and Stanford found that, after the 2016 election, users’ interaction with fake news stories declined by over 50% on Facebook, while they increased on Twitter.[50] Similarly, another study by the fact-checking arm of French newspaper, Le Monde, showed a 50% drop in engagement with fake news sources in France since 2015.[51] Nonetheless, sites repeatedly flagged by Facebook as false still appear on the platform,[52] and Facebook-user engagements with fake news sites still hover around 70 million per month.[53]

An outstanding challenge for Facebook is its News Feed algorithm, currently optimized to maximize the ""engagement"" of its users.[54] Articles not likely to ""engage"" a user based on their prior conduct (e.g. what they have liked, shared, or posted) are deprioritized in favor of articles that prompt a user to respond, whether because users approve of something and ""like"" it or because they are outraged. Because fake news stories are frequently designed to be intentionally ""outrageous,"" they receive an algorithmic boost over more reliable content.[55] The aforementioned techniques Facebook uses to minimize ""fake news"" through diminishing its presence in the News Feed counteract that algorithmic boost but have led some to criticize Facebook for explicit censorship. They are not wrong. After all, the consequence of ""diminishing"" posts by 80% versus removing them is not substantial.[56]

Facebook is a private entity unrestrained by the Constitution.[57] So far, efforts to apply the First Amendment to it have failed.[58] Nonetheless, it’s wrong to assume that constitutional restraints will never reach it. The Court has imposed constitutional restraints on private actors in the past, and there is reason to believe it could do so again, potentially this term in Halleck v. Manhattan Community Access.[59] Should the Court decide that regulating speech in a ""public forum"" necessarily qualifies as state action under the ""public function"" test, it would pave the way for transforming Facebook into a state actor with respect to government pages. After all, Facebook’s current program of content moderation—from minimizing posts, to deleting accounts, to evaluating ads—certainly qualifies as speech regulation. While free speech advocates are right to demand that Facebook enhance transparency and accountability, treating Facebook as a state actor would exacerbate the fake news problem.

The Court currently employs a two-part framework to determine whether the Constitution applies against a private actor—often referred to as the Lugar-Edmondson framework.[60] First, litigants must prove ""the claimed deprivation resulted from the exercise of a right or privilege having its source in state authority.""[61] Second, litigants must show that the private parties whose actions caused the deprivation ""may be appropriately characterized as 'state actors.'""[62] Where deprivation is caused by a nominally private entity, the Court employs different tests: the ""public function test"" (when the state delegates a so-called ""public function"") is the most relevant when considering how state action doctrine might be expanded to include Facebook.[63]

At present, the public function test is narrowly conceived. In Jackson v.Metropolitan Edison Co., the Court defined a ""public function"" as the exercise ""by a private entity of powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the state.""[64] These ""traditionally exclusively reserved"" functions include running elections;[65] maintaining a municipal park;[66] and -- in the days of company towns -- operating an entire town.[67] Despite the fact that many private entities engage in activities serving the public, the Court has avoided classifying more under the ""public function"" umbrella, for fear of impinging on private actors’ freedom.[68] Consequently, the Court engages in awkward analysis trying to distinguish actions that are the exclusive prerogative of governments from those that governments often perform.[69] As the doctrine stands, Facebook fails the public function test because what Facebook does -- from moderating content to ""storing, caching, or providing access to content"" -- is not a traditional function exclusively reserved to the government.[70] Nonetheless, it’s possible that the Court might adopt a more expansive notion of ""public function"" so as to include some Facebook’s activities: namely, its moderation of online content, including fake news or hate speech.

In October, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Halleck v. Manhattan Community Access, a Second Circuit case that applied a new state action test for determining whether a public access television channel qualified as a state actor for purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.[71] The Second Circuit relied on Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, which said that when public access channels are required by law, those channels qualify as per se ""designated public forums.""[72]From this, the court reasoned that, because federal law authorized setting aside channels for public access and a municipality contracted with a non-profit organization to then run those channels, those channels qualified as ""public forums.""[73] To determine whether the First Amendment would apply against the non-profit tasked to run those channels, the Second Circuit evaluated the connection between the municipality and the non-profit—concluding that because the president of the municipality designated the Manhattan Neighborhood to run the channels, the non-profit had a sufficient connection to the state to qualify as a ""state actor.""[74] In a concurring opinion, Judge Lohier endorsed the majority’s hybrid state action test.[75] Furthermore, he argued that on the basis of Lee v. Katz,[76] a Ninth Circuit decision which held regulating speech in a public forum qualified as a ""public function"" traditionally within the exclusive domain of the State, the non-profit qualified as a ""state actor"" under the traditional public function analysis.[77] On appeal, the Court will likely address whether its three state actor tests are exhaustive or, in keeping with the Second Circuit’s opinion, whether an alternative state-actor test might be adopted. Either way, the Court will likely confront whether the regulation of speech in a ""public forum"" necessarily qualifies as a ""public function"" for purposes of the state actor test, as Judge Lohier argued in his concurrence. If the Court says that regulating speech in a public forum is indeed a public function that qualifies a private entity as a state actor, the outcome would have immediate implications for deciding whether Facebook qualifies as a state actor. After all, Facebook’s moderation of content—from diminishing posts to deleting accounts—would certainly count as ""regulation."" The follow-on inquiry then becomes: which Facebook pages and groups necessarily qualify as ""public forums"" for purposes of the state action test, if any qualify at all.

When Does Facebook Become a ""Public Forum?""

At present, the Court broadly defines a public forum as a designated place for the ""free exchange of ideas"" where speakers ""cannot be excluded without a compelling governmental interest"" that is ""narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.""[78] When determining whether a space is a public forum, courts examine the ""nature of the property"" and ""its compatibility with expressive activity.""[79] As a general rule, public forums involve government property and government control.[80] However, in some instances the Court has treated privately owned property controlled by the government as a public forum.[81]

Unlike the public access channel at issue in Halleck v. Manhattan Community Access, the government never delegated to Facebook the job of creating and maintaining its online platform. Instead, Facebook’s platform and governing rules fall entirely within Facebook’s proprietary domain.[82] Thus, some argue that Facebook is not a public forum, suggesting that any effort to moderate false content on Facebook would not qualify as state action under Judge’s Lohier’s application of Lee v. Katz.[83] Nonetheless, the Court’s 2017 decision in Packingham v. North Carolina suggests a more expansive public forum doctrine that could encompass certain pages on Facebook.[84] Striking down a North Carolina statute prohibiting registered sex offenders from accessing social networking websites, the Court in Packingham likened social media sites to parks and streets calling social media sites ""the modern public square.""[85] By ""analogizing to public space,"" some argue, the Court ""suggested that the public forum doctrine . . . might extend to all or parts of the internet and social media,"" despite the dual private-public nature of the site.[86] So far, litigants have not succeeded on this very broad application of the public forum doctrine. Nonetheless, they have succeeded on a narrow reading whereby Facebook pages qualify as ""public forums"" where the government exercises control over a page or site.[87] For example, in 2017, Twitter users blocked by President Trump filed a lawsuit arguing that because his Twitter Page constituted a ""public forum,"" denying them access to it violated their First Amendment rights; the District Court judge agreed.[88] Similarly, in Davison v. Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, the Court held a local official violated the First Amendment by banning an individual from her Facebook page and issued declaratory judgement that the official’s ""social media page operated as a forum for speech.""[89]

Though narrowly tailored to government-created pages, the logic of the aforementioned decisions could remake the state action doctrine. After all, the ability to control content in government-created pages—that is, the ability to remove content or minimize posts on a page -- belongs to both the government and Facebook. Should the Court decide that regulating speech in a public forum is necessarily a ""public function"" -- as Judge Lohier argues -- it would open the door for litigants to bring First Amendment actions against Facebook, rather than just against the government, anytime their content is minimized or removed from a government-created page. This would be a bad result.

Applying the state action doctrine against Facebook for purposes of government-created pages would chill Facebook’s incentive to moderate false content on those pages. Considering the government-created pages that currently exist on Facebook, this result could be disastrous. Millions follow the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Facebook. Were a false comment to appear on the FBI website showing a made-up video of an FBI-sponsored ""attack,"" it could undermine public trust in the FBI. Neither Facebook nor the government would be able to do anything about it. Similarly, local, state, and national officials make personal accounts to raise awareness about their campaigns and government initiatives. Were Facebook treated as a state actor with respect to government pages, it’s possible that Facebook would not moderate any content affecting those pages. Treating Facebook as a state actor would result in a clutter of false, misleading content on important sites. Further, one might argue that bad actors, seeking to thwart any moderation by Facebook, would increasingly try to misrepresent their pages as somehow ""government-related.""[90] Legal commentators caution against applying the First Amendment to Facebook because it would curtail the ability of the sites to moderate harmful content, creating an internet that ""nobody wants.""[91] While Facebook users are certainly right to worry about censorship by Facebook, processes can be created to maximize accountability and transparency without resort to the state action doctrine. The 2016 election showed the consequences when Facebook doesn’t believe it has a social obligation to act. Hopefully, the Court will avoid that signal.

Before 2016, Facebook recognized the impact of its News Feed in shaping political attitudes and associations. In 2012, for example, Facebook had published a report on the 2010 midterms, showing that political mobilization messages on Facebook ""directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people."" Nonetheless, the notion that foreign actors could infiltrate the US political debate came as a surprise.

[53] See Allcott, supra note 50. In the advertising context, recent stories suggest insufficient compliance. As the New York Times reported in June 2018, a Democratic candidate running for Congress in California, Regina Bateson, was explicitly targeted by negative political advertisements by a group that failed to identify itself in keeping with Facebook’s rules, not to mention the FEC’s updated 2017 guidelines, which similarly require the identity and location of the information’s sponsor for online Facebook ads. The man responsible, Paul Smith, said he had successfully placed many political advertisements on Facebook without appropriate labelling. See Sheera Frenkel, Facebook Tried to Rein In Fake Ads.

NBC4 Washington reported Sunday that the fliers showed up in the Tenleytown neighborhood where a man fired a gun inside a pizza restaurant last year.

Edgar M. Welch said he wanted to investigate wild online claims of a child sex ring at Comet Ping Pong. The North Carolina man was sentenced to four years in prison.

The fliers were placed on fences and doors and called for the conspiracy theory to be reinvestigated. Residents said they were feeling ""rage, anger and disgust.""

86,"WASHINGTON — Days before the presidential election, James Alefantis, owner of a local pizza restaurant called Comet Ping Pong, noticed an unusual spike in the number of his Instagram followers.

Within hours, menacing messages like “we’re on to you” began appearing in his Instagram feed. In the ensuing days, hundreds of death threats — one read “I will kill you personally” — started arriving via texts, Facebook and Twitter. All of them alleged something that made Mr. Alefantis’s jaw drop: that Comet Ping Pong was the home base of a child abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief, John D. Podesta.

When Mr. Alefantis discovered that his employees were getting similar abusive messages, he looked online to unravel the accusations. He found dozens of made-up articles about Mrs. Clinton kidnapping, molesting and trafficking children in the restaurant’s back rooms. The articles appeared on Facebook and on websites such as The New Nationalist and The Vigilant Citizen, with one headline blaring: “Pizzagate: How 4Chan Uncovered the Sick World of Washington’s Occult Elite.”

None of it was true. While Mr. Alefantis has some prominent Democratic friends in Washington and was a supporter of Mrs. Clinton, he has never met her, does not sell or abuse children, and is not being investigated by law enforcement for any of these claims. He and his 40 employees had unwittingly become real people caught in the middle of a storm of fake news.",mainstream,M116bc,pizzagate
864,"An employee who reportedly worked at Jeffrey Epstein’s secluded Caribbean island claims the wealthy financier – who is accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls – kept a mysterious safe inside the main residence.

The revelation comes as Little St. James Island in St. Thomas is going under the microscope in the wake of Epstein’s recent arrest. The 66-year-old was known to frequent the lush property in the U.S. Virgin Islands – and the employee, speaking to Bloomberg, suggested that a steel safe inside his office there may have stored more than just cash.

Outside of rare visits by housekeepers, no one – the employee claimed – was allowed to enter the room where that steel safe was said to be located.

Epstein started transforming Little St. James Island after he bought it more than two decades ago — clearing the native vegetation, ringing the property with towering palm trees and planting two massive U.S. flags on either end.

LABOR SECRETARY ACOSTA ANNOUNCES HE WILL STEP DOWN AMID CRITICISM OVER EPSTEIN PLEA DEAL

He also built a stone mansion with cream-colored walls and a bright turquoise roof surrounded by several other structures, including the maids’ quarters and a massive, square-shaped white building on one end of the island. Workers there, the Associated Press reports, told each other it was a music room fitted with a grand piano and acoustic walls, whose gold dome flew off during the deadly 2017 hurricane season.

The employee that spoke to Bloomberg said when Epstein would visit the property, he would walk around shirtless in shorts and flip-flops, and had a rule that he should never catch sight of the staff that maintained the place.

Sometimes, the employee added, women would sunbathe topless or in the nude around a pool near the island’s main residence.

Many people who worked for Epstein on the island told The Associated Press this week that they had signed long non-disclosure agreements, and refused to talk. One former employee who declined to be identified said Epstein once had five boats, including a large ferry in which he transported up to 200 workers from St. Thomas to his island every day for construction work.

EPSTEIN WANTS OUT OF JAIL BEFORE TRIAL

The man said he saw a handful of young women when he was on Epstein’s property but he believed they were older than 18.

“When he was there, it was keep to yourself and do your thing,” the man recalled, adding that Epstein paid well and would give away older machinery and surplus including lumber to his employees.

Government documents and ledgers show Little St. James Island was once known as Mingo Cay. In April 1998, a company called L.S.J. LLC bought it for $7.95 million. Additional documents showed that Epstein is the sole member of L.S.J., with his signature reminiscent of an infinity loop.

Epstein later bought neighboring Great St. James Island, which once was popular with locals and tourists for its main attraction, Christmas Cove, a place where you could hang out and order pizza and have it delivered via boat.

“He wasn’t well received,” recalled Spencer Consolvo, a St. Thomas native who runs a tourist shop near a large marina. “People think he’s too rich to be policed properly.”

According to public records obtained by the AP, the island was once worth $3 million and owned by a woman who died in a chalet in Switzerland. The island had been divided into parcels and given to three people and was later sold to Epstein.

Federal authorities consider the smaller of the two islands to be Epstein’s primary residence in the United States, a place where at least one alleged victim said in a court affidavit that she participated in an orgy, as well as had sex with Epstein and other people. She said she saw former U.S. President Bill Clinton on the island, but that she never saw him having sex with anyone. A Clinton spokesman has issued a statement saying he never visited there.

1079,"WASHINGTON — Michael G. Flynn, the son of President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, is a subject of the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election and possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign, according to four current and former government officials.

The inquiry into Flynn is focused at least in part on his work with his father's lobbying firm, Flynn Intel Group, three of the officials said. It's unclear when the focus on Flynn began.

Barry Coburn, who said he is serving as the younger Flynn's legal counsel, said he couldn't comment on the matter.

Flynn's status as a subject of the Russia investigation widens the publicly known scope of the probe. NBC News has reported that those under investigation have included the elder Flynn and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Others under scrutiny by special counsel Robert Mueller include Carter Page, a Trump campaign ally; Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior White House adviser; and the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.

Trump Jr. may be called to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee sometime this fall. He, Kushner, Manafort and Page have all denied any collusion with Russia during the campaign.

Ty Cobb, an attorney for President Trump, said that the younger Flynn's status as a subject of the probe ""does not impact the White House to any extent with regard to its continuing cooperation with the special counsel.""

The elder Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, declined to comment Tuesday when asked how his client responds to allegations of collusion with Russia. On Twitter, Michael G. Flynn appeared to call the report that he is a subject of the Russia probe a ""#Nothingburger"": ""#FakeNews Media: 'We're done covering those ""pesky hurricanes' right????...Back to Russia!' #Nothingburger.""

The president also has come under scrutiny for possible obstruction of justice and has denied colluding with Russia.

The younger Flynn worked closely with his father, whose connections to foreign governments, including Russia and Turkey, have been a subject of federal and congressional investigations.

Michael G. Flynn accompanied his father, for instance, on a trip to Moscow in December 2015 for the elder Flynn to deliver a paid speech at a 10th anniversary celebration for the state-sponsored Russian television network RT. The younger Flynn can be seen in video from an associated event.

The elder Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was seated at the same table as Russian President Vladimir Putin during the dinner. Records released by the House Oversight Committee show he was paid nearly $34,000 for his speech; RT also paid for Flynn and his son's airfare to Moscow and lodging at a luxury hotel from Dec. 9 to Dec. 12.

Flynn Intel Group also was paid $530,000 in 2016 for work the Justice Department has said benefited the government of Turkey. The elder Flynn did not register as a foreign lobbyist at the time, but did so retroactively this year. According to his filing with the Justice Department, he was hired by a Turkish businessman to gather information about Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish cleric residing in Pennsylvania whom the Turkish government accuses of orchestrating an attempted coup there in July 2016.

The elder Flynn was fired as Trump's national security adviser in February after it became public that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.

A former business associate of Michael Flynn's said the younger Flynn had a heavy hand in the day-to-day operations of Flynn Intel Group and served as his father's chief of staff. Those responsibilities included attending meetings with his father and communicating with prospective clients, the former business associate said.

Several legal experts with knowledge of the investigation have told NBC News they believe Mueller, following a classic prosecutorial playbook, is seeking to compel key players, including Flynn and Manafort, to tell what they know about any possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Mueller has brought onto his team a federal prosecutor known for convincing subjects to turn on associates. Any potential criminal liability for Michael G. Flynn could put added pressure on his father, these legal experts said.

""Any time a family member is identified as a subject that does increase pressure,"" said Peter White, a former federal prosecutor. ""In the typical parent-child relationship the last thing any parent would want is for their child to get in trouble for something they initiated.""

That pressure appeared to mount Wednesday, when House Democrats released information they said confirmed that the elder Flynn omitted from his security clearance renewal application in 2016 that he had traveled to the Middle East in 2015 to meet with foreign leaders about a proposal to partner with Russia in a plan to build nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia.

In a letter to Flynn's former business partners who had turned over documents to Congress, Democratic Reps. Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Eliot Engel of New York also accuse Flynn of concealing the trip from background check investigators who interviewed him during that 2016 process. The congressmen, ranking members on the House Oversight and House Foreign Affairs committees respectively, told the former business partners that because ""it appears that General Flynn violated federal law"" they are turning over their documents to Mueller.

Peter Carr, the spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment. Kelner, the elder Flynn's lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment on the Cummings-Engel letter.

The younger Flynn, 34, has a bachelor's degree from the University of North Carolina-Charlotte and an associate degree in golf course management. He is married, has one son and lives in Northern Virginia. He worked for a golf company and then a healthcare management firm between 2008 and 2015, and since 2014 has worked for the Flynn Intel Group, according to LinkedIn. He was a registered Republican in Charlotte, N.C., from 2004 to 2008, according to public records.

He was a controversial figure during the presidential campaign and during the Trump transition, known for writing inflammatory comments on Twitter and circulating conspiracy theories.

He perpetuated a so-called ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theory that surfaced in the days before the November election alleging Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had used the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington to run a child sex-trafficking operation. About a month later, in December 2016, a North Carolina man fired gunshots in the pizzeria allegedly in response to the false ""pizzagate"" story. At the time, Flynn wrote on Twitter: ""Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story.""

During the Trump transition there were questions about whether Flynn had an official role. He had a government transition email address and was said to be helping his father, who had been named national security adviser. But after the shooting at the ""pizzagate"" restaurant, Pence, who was in charge of the transition, said Flynn ""has no involvement in the transition whatsoever.""

The younger Flynn continues to express political opinions on social media, tweeting in support of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and tweeting criticism of Black Lives Matter.",mainstream,M0f8f8,pizzagate
549,"The nuclear disaster has contaminated the world’s largest ocean in only five years and it’s still leaking 300 tons of radioactive waste every day.

What was the most dangerous nuclear disaster in world history? Most people would say the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine, but they’d be wrong.

In 2011, an earthquake, believed to be an aftershock of the 2010 earthquake in Chile, created a tsunami that caused a meltdown at the TEPCO nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan.

Three nuclear reactors melted down and what happened next was the largest release of radiation into the water in the history of the world. Over the next three months, radioactive chemicals, some in even greater quantities than Chernobyl, leaked into the Pacific Ocean.

However, the numbers may actually be much higher as Japanese official estimates have been proven by several scientists to be flawed in recent years.

If that weren’t bad enough, Fukushima continues to leak an astounding 300 tons of radioactive waste into the Pacific Ocean every day. It will continue do so indefinitely as the source of the leak cannot be sealed as it is inaccessible to both humans and robots due to extremely high temperatures.

It should come as no surprise, then, that Fukushima has contaminated the entire Pacific Ocean in just five years. This could easily be the worst environmental disaster in human history and it is almost never talked about by politicians, establishment scientists, or the news.

It is interesting to note that TEPCO is a subsidiary of General Electric (also known as GE), one of the largest companies in the world, which has considerable control over numerous news corporations and politicians alike.

Could this possibly explain the lack of news coverage Fukushima has received in the last five years?

There is also evidence that GE knew about the poor condition of the Fukushima reactors for decades and did nothing. This led 1,400 Japanese citizens to sue GE for their role in the Fukushima nuclear disaster.

Fukushima in a Nutshell: Here is the Truth

Even if we can’t see the radiation itself, some parts of North America’s western coast have been feeling the effects for years. Not long after Fukushima, fish in Canada began bleeding from their gills, mouths, and eyeballs.

This “disease” has been ignored by the government and has decimated native fish populations, including the North Pacific herring. Elsewhere in Western Canada, independent scientists have measured a 300% increase in the level of radiation.

According to them, the amount of radiation in the Pacific Ocean is increasing every year. Why is this being ignored by the mainstream media?

It might have something to do with the fact that the US and Canadian governments have banned their citizens from talking about Fukushima so “people don’t panic.”

Further south in Oregon, USA, starfish began losing legs and then disintegrating entirely when Fukushima radiation arrived there in 2013. Now, they are dying in record amounts, putting the entire oceanic ecosystem in that area at risk.

However, government officials say Fukushima is not to blame even though radiation in Oregon tuna tripled after Fukushima.

In 2014, radiation on California beaches increased by 500 percent. In response, government officials said that the radiation was coming from a mysterious “unknown” source and was nothing to worry about.

However, Fukushima is having a bigger impact than just the West coast of North America.

Scientists are now saying that the Pacific Ocean is already radioactive and is currently at least 5-10 times more radioactive than when the US government dropped numerous nuclear bombs in the Pacific during and after World War II.

706,"WASHINGTONWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A North Carolina man pleaded guilty on Friday to opening fire in a Washington pizzeria that fake news reports claimed housed a child sex ring linked to 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Edgar Welch, 28, of Salisbury, was accused of firing at least three shots from an AR-15 rifle inside the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in December and pointing the gun at an employee after showing up to investigate the online conspiracy rumors. No one was hurt.

Welch pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to a federal charge of interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit an offense and a local charge of assault with a dangerous weapon.

Welch, dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, said little more than ""Yes, ma'am"" in response to questions from Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Asked what he wanted to do, he said, ""Plead guilty.""

He could face up to two years in prison on the federal charge and a maximum five years for the assault charge. Jackson scheduled sentencing for June 22.

Welch also faces potential fines and must pay restitution for damage to a computer, door lock and a ping pong table at the restaurant.

A local firearms charge was dropped as part of Welch's plea. He also carried a loaded .38-caliber revolver into the pizzeria, and police found a loaded shotgun in his car, according to court documents.

Welch told police he was investigating a bogus conspiracy theory known as ""pizzagate."" Posts to social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and the Reddit online message board falsely claimed Comet was the center of a child sex ring run by Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta.

The claims were part of a proliferation of false news reports during the U.S. presidential election campaign, often disseminated through websites purporting to be news outlets and quoting bogus sources.

Scott Talan, a communications professor at Washington's American University, said Welch was an example of how mistrust of traditional news sources and of authorities' ability to investigate suspected crimes could prompt vigilante-style behavior.

772,"MILWAUKEE — President Donald Trump was more than halfway through his speech at a rally in Milwaukee when one of his hand gestures caught the eye of a supporter standing in the packed arena.

The 51-year-old woman believed the president had traced the shape of the letter “Q” with his fingers as a covert signal to followers of QAnon, a right-wing, pro-Trump conspiracy theory. She turned to the couple on her right and excitedly asked, “Did you see the ‘Q’?”

“He just did it?” asked Diane Jacobson, 63, of Racine, Wisconsin.

“I think it was,” replied their new friend, Chrisy. The Geneva, Illinois, resident declined to give her last name in part because she said she wanted to avoid negative “attention.”

The Jacobsons met Chrisy and her husband, Paul, hours earlier in the line to get into the Jan 14 rally. The couples bonded over their shared interest in QAnon, which centers on the baseless belief that Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the “deep state” and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals.

What started as an online obsession for the far-right fringe has grown beyond its origins in a dark corner of the internet. QAnon has been creeping into the mainstream political arena for more than a year. The trend shows no sign of abating as Trump fires up his reelection campaign operation, attracting a loyal audience of conspiracy theorists and other fringe groups to his raucous rallies.

Trump has retweeted QAnon-promoting accounts. Followers flock to Trump’s rallies wearing clothes and hats with QAnon symbols and slogans. At least 23 current or former congressional candidates in the 2020 election cycle have endorsed or promoted QAnon, according to the liberal watchdog Media Matters for America, which compiled online evidence to support its running tally.

Conspiracy theorists aren’t the only fringe characters drawn to Trump rallies. The Oath Keepers, an anti-government group formed in 2009 after President Barack Obama’s election, has been sending “security volunteers” to escort Trump supporters at rallies across the country.

University of California, Davis history professor Kathryn Olmsted, author of a book called “Real Enemies: Conspiracy Theories and American Democracy, World War I to 9/11,” said it’s unclear whether QAnon has attracted more believers than other conspiracy theories that have intersected with U.S. politics.

“What’s different now is that there are people in power who are spreading this conspiracy theory,” she said, adding that Trump’s conspiracy-minded rhetoric seems to fire up part of his base. “Finally, there is someone saying they’re not crazy.”

Conspiracy theories are nothing new, but experts fear the powerful engine of social media and a volatile political climate have ramped up the threat of violence. An FBI bulletin in May warned that conspiracy theory-driven extremists have become a domestic terrorism threat. The bulletin specifically mentions QAnon.

A Trump campaign spokeswoman and a White House spokesman didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. Asked about QAnon in 2018, then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump “condemns and denounces any group that would incite violence against another individual.” Some major Trump supporters, including former White House aide Sebastian Gorka, have denounced QAnon.

For more than two years, followers have pored over a tangled set of clues purportedly posted online by a high-ranking government official known only as “Q.” Many followers believe the late John F. Kennedy Jr. is a Trump supporter who faked his death in a 1999 plane crash. Another core belief is that thousands of deep state operatives and top Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and Obama, will be rounded up and sent to Guantanamo Bay during an event called “The Storm.”

The first Q “drop” appeared on the 4chan imageboard in October 2017. The messages migrated to 8chan until a string of mass shootings by gunmen who posted manifestos on the site led to it getting forced offline in August. The disruption, which ended when the imageboard relaunched in November under the new name 8kun, hardly spelled the end of QAnon.

Travis View, a conspiracy theory researcher who co-hosts The QAnon Anonymous Podcast and has written about QAnon for the Washington Post under his pseudonym, said the sense of community forged by QAnon believers has helped it endure beyond the life span of other conspiracy theories.

“People in the QAnon community feel like they are banding together to uncover the real truth behind the scenes,” said View, who works as a marketer for a San Diego company and says he uses the pseudonym to protect himself. His acerbic comments about what he calls an “apocalyptic political cult” have earned him more than 20,000 followers on Twitter and vitriol from QAnon believers.

Before Trump’s rally in Milwaukee, thousands waited in line for hours to enter the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena. Some wore apparel adorned with a “Q” or “WWG1WGA,” which stands for the QAnon slogan, “Where we go one, we go all.”

The frigid, gloomy weather didn’t dampen the spirits of QAnon follower Donna Shank, 50, of Burlington, Wisconsin. Shank, who said she voted for Obama in 2008, was ambivalent about politics before she stumbled across QAnon online and joined Facebook groups to learn more.

“I just woke up,” she said. “I was a sheep. I followed anything and everything.”

Diane Jacobson attached a pink “Q” and a blue “Q” to the back of her black “Make America Great Again” hat. She and her husband were eager to attend their first Trump rally.

“Trump is trying to tell us, to the best he can without compromising intelligence, what’s really going on,” she said.

Jacobson knows many people, including some of her relatives, scoff at QAnon.

“You really can’t argue with them,” she said.

Jacobson celebrated with her new friend, Chrisy, when the doors to the downtown arena opened.

“All these people believe me! I’m not crazy here!” Chrisy shouted.

Hours later, during Trump’s speech, Chrisy’s husband, Paul, grinned when the president said “the whole world is watching” what’s happening with protesters in Iran.

“That’s a Q reference,” Paul said, noting the phrase “the world is watching” has appeared several times in Q drops.

The May 30 bulletin sent by the FBI’s Phoenix field office warned of conspiracy theories inspiring violence by groups and “individual extremists,” according to an October court filing for a QAnon-related criminal investigation in Colorado. Police in the Denver suburb of Parker said Cynthia Abcug was accused of conspiring with QAnon supporters to kidnap her son from foster care. Abcug was arrested in Montana on Dec. 30 and awaits extradition to Colorado.

Internet-fueled conspiracies already have been linked to acts of real-world violence. A man charged with killing the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family last March showed off a QAnon symbol scrawled on his left hand during a court appearance. In 2017, a North Carolina man was sentenced to prison for firing a rifle in a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant at the center of the debunked “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that high-profile Democrats run a child sex trafficking ring out of the restaurant’s (nonexistent) basement.

Pizzagate and other far-right conspiracy theories have faded, but experts see no end in sight to QAnon’s popularity.

Nancy Rosenblum, a Harvard University professor emeritus of ethics in politics and government, said the apocalyptic nature of the QAnon narrative resonates with those who want to believe that their political enemies will be vanquished and a better future will rise from the ashes.

“What makes it unique is that Trump is the chosen one,” said Rosenblum, co-author of the book “A Lot of People Are Saying: The New Conspiracism and the Assault on Democracy.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the arrest of a man who police say fired shots in a pizzeria while investigating a fake news story (all times local):

A man who police say fired an assault rifle inside a pizzeria in the nation’s capital while investigating a fake news story about Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring has been ordered held until at least Thursday.

Presiding Magistrate Judge Joseph E. Beshouri ordered 28-year-old Edgar Maddison Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina, jailed until a preliminary hearing and detention hearing set for 9 a.m. Thursday in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

Welch was arrested after Sunday’s shooting at Comet Ping Pong. No one was injured.

He appeared in handcuffs in court Thursday wearing a white, disposable jumpsuit used when authorities take a suspect’s clothing as evidence. He was appointed a public defender who didn’t immediately return requests for comment.

Court records show a man charged with a firing a rifle inside a pizzeria surrendered peacefully after he told authorities he failed to find evidence after fake online news stories said the eatery was secretly harboring child sex slaves.

Twenty-eight-year-old Edgar M. Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina, was expected to make an initial court appearance Monday afternoon in the District of Columbia.

Police say he brought a rifle into the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in the nations’ capital because he wanted to investigate rumors contained in fake online news reports claiming it was connected to a child sex trafficking ring supposedly run by Hillary Clinton.

The court document states Welch “surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.”

In recent weeks, the so-called Pizzagate scandal has gained currency among some quarters in social media, fueled by the fake news stories distributed online.

The conspiracy theory involving a fake news story that links Hillary Clinton and a D.C. pizza shop to a child exploitation ring has at least one prominent adherent linked to President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team.

Michael Flynn Jr. is an adviser to his father, Michael Flynn, whom Trump selected to serve as national security adviser.

Flynn Jr. has sent numerous posts on Twitter about the conspiracy theories of Pizzagate, a fake news story that suggests a pizza shop called Comet Ping Pong plays a key role in a child sex trafficking ring run by Clinton.

Police say the conspiracy theory led to violence Sunday when a North Carolina man fired a rifle in the restaurant as he sought to investigate the accusations. No one was injured, and the man was arrested.

Flynn Jr., who has accompanied his father to presidential transition meetings inside Trump Tower and lists the presidential transition website as part of his Twitter bio, tweeted Sunday night that, “Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it’ll remain a story.”

Trump’s team had no immediate response to questions about the conspiracy theory or the younger Flynn’s role in the presidential transition.

The bizarre conspiracy theory known as Pizzagate that police say led to a nonfatal shooting at a pizza shop in the nation’s capital has affected several area businesses.

Politics and Prose is an independent bookstore a few doors down from Comet Ping Pong, where a North Carolina man was arrested Sunday after police say he fired a rifle while trying to investigate a fake news story about Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring.

Bookstore co-owners Bradley Graham and Lissa Muscatine said that while Comet Ping Pong has found itself at the center of the conspiracy theory, the bookstore and other businesses on the block also received threats and menacing phone calls in recent weeks.

Graham said the store has taken the threats seriously, reporting them to police. He expressed frustration that police seemed uninterested before Sunday’s shooting in investigating more thoroughly.

Politics and Prose was open for business Monday; Comet Ping Pong was closed through Monday afternoon, as it normally is. Neighbors brought flowers and cards to the restaurant storefront saying “We support Comet” and “we love you and stand by you.”

Authorities say a man who fired a rifle inside a pizzeria in the nation’s capital while investigating a fake news story about Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring is expected to appear in court Monday afternoon.

Police say 28-year-old Edgar Maddison Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina, was arrested after Sunday’s incident at Comet Ping Pong. No one was injured and he was arrested afterward.

It was unclear how long it might take before Welch’s case is heard.

An incident report lists a Colt AR-15 rifle, a Colt .38 handgun, a shotgun and a folding knife among the items seized in the case. Welch is charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, other weapons offenses and destruction of property.

SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Nearly two decades after the Aryan Nations’ Idaho compound was demolished, far-right extremists are maintaining a presence in the Pacific Northwest.

White nationalism has been on the rise across the U.S., but it has particular resonance along the Idaho-Washington border, where the Aryans espoused hate and violence for years.

The neo-Nazi group was based near Hayden Lake, Idaho, starting in the 1970s, and eventually was bankrupted in a lawsuit brought by local activists and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Its compound was seized, and supporters dispersed.

But a series of incidents in recent weeks show far-right sentiments never really left the conservative region. In the county that is home to Hayden Lake, for instance, Republicans last month passed a measure expressing support for U.S. entry of a prominent Austrian far-right activist who was investigated for ties to the suspected New Zealand mosque gunman.

In 2018, at least nine hate groups operated in the region of Spokane and northern Idaho, including Identity Evropa, Proud Boys, ACT for America and America’s Promise Ministries, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The center does not track how many members belong to each group.

Keegan Hankes, a researcher for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the number of hate groups is growing across the U.S., driven in part by a toxic political culture. The human rights group counted 784 active hate groups in the U.S. in 2014 and 1,020 in 2018.

In particular, white supremacist groups are growing because of fears that the country’s racial makeup is changing. “That drives a ton of anxiety,” Hankes said.

These new far-right activists are more scattered than the ones who used to gather at the Aryan Nations by the dozens, experts say.

“It is no longer necessary to go to a compound in Hayden Lake, Idaho,” said Kristine Hoover, director of the Gonzaga Institute for Hate Studies in Spokane.

With the proliferation of social media, groups “form in dispersed locations” and gatherings are “more covert,” she said.

In late April, a self-described “American Nationalist” named Brittany Pettibone appeared at a meeting of Kootenai County, Idaho, Republicans to ask for help to bring her boyfriend, Martin Sellner, to the country from Austria. Pettibone, 26, said Sellner wants to marry her and live in Post Falls, Idaho.

Pettibone was a big promoter of the hoax known as “Pizzagate,” telling her online followers Hillary Clinton and other high-profile Democrats were involved in satanic rituals and child sex trafficking tied to a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant.

Sellner is a leading figure in the extremist “identitarian” movement, which espouses a white nationalist ideology and has swept over Europe amid an influx of migrants and refugees. He has confirmed he exchanged emails with the suspected New Zealand shooter, who donated money to Sellner’s group. But Sellner denies involvement in the attack.

Despite his background, the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee passed a resolution urging the federal government to allow Sellner into the United States. The resolution said the government revoked Sellner’s travel privileges “for political reasons,” and demanded those privileges be reinstated.

Faced with criticism for giving Pettibone a platform, Kootenai County GOP Chair Brent Regan blamed the press. “In its lust for scandal, the media has stretched the committee’s simple act of kindness into headlines that are too bizarre to be fiction,” he wrote in a recent op-ed.

Also last month, The Guardian published internet chats from 2017 in which a Washington state legislator and three other men discussed confronting “leftists” with a variety of tactics, including violence, surveillance and intimidation.

The messages prompted Washington House Democrats to demand that the Republican lawmaker, Rep. Matt Shea of Spokane Valley, be reprimanded for a history of far-right speech and activities. While Shea did not propose violence, he did not speak up when violence was proposed, Democrats said.

House Republican Leader J.T. Wilcox of Yelm responded that Shea should not be punished before investigations are completed. The House, led by Democrats, will conduct an independent investigation of the lawmaker.

Shea, who rarely speaks to reporters, did not return numerous messages from The Associated Press.

He has served in the state House since 2008, introducing bills to criminalize abortion and roll back gun laws and pushing for eastern Washington to secede from the rest of the state. The military veteran attracted international attention in 2018 after a document he wrote laid out a “biblical basis for war” against people who practiced same-sex marriage and abortion, and instructed: “If they do not yield, kill all males.”

In a third case, a nationwide arrest warrant was issued in May for a Stevens County, Washington, man who allegedly tried to extort members of his right-wing militia group through anonymous written threats backed by insinuations they came from a Mexican drug cartel.

James “Russell” Bolton, 51, faces at least six charges of extortion and attempted theft after he was arrested recently in West Virginia.

Stevens County detectives believe he was responsible for a series of anonymous threatening letters delivered to members of the group. The letters purported to come from a Mexican cartel and demanded large sums of cash in exchange for protection.

Hoover, the Gonzaga professor, said it is a mistake to consider all of the above as separate incidents.

“These are movements,” Hoover said, noting participants are not doing this alone. “They have interconnectedness over the internet.”",mainstream,M0819e,pizzagate
296,"CBS Show Under Fire for Tweeting 'Assassinate,' 'President,' and 'Trump'

CBS primetime show, ""The Good Fight, came under fierce criticism after tweeting an image from one of its episodes depicted a list of ""target words"" which included ""Assassinate,"" ""President"" and ""Trump.""

The word appeared in a red column and a second orange column that began with the words: ""Mar-a-Lago"" and ""Eliminate.""

The episode based around the character Diane (Christine Baranski) joining a female resistance group whose job it is to diminish Donald Trump's approval ratings. 



According to Deadline: Her phone communications with members of the group were intercepted by the NSA analysts, Stephen (Michael Urie) and Dev (Maulik Pancholy), fan favorites from The Good Wife.

31,"Marina Abramović is on a Skype call from Madrid, showing off her custom-made red sweater, which says “Love conquers all.”

“I’ve been wearing it all the time,” she says in her husky, Serbian accent. “It’s like my pyjamas.”

This lighter side of Abramović – a Skype pyjama party from Spain – is not what we’re used to seeing from the trailblazing performance artist. Now, an even different version of her is on view in a solo show at the Sean Kelly Gallery in New York. Early Works features 12 historical performances from 1970 to 1975 – a time when the now multimillionaire artist was penniless and living out of a car with a backpack full of film negatives.

“I lived in cars and trucks, I’m amazed the negatives survived,” said Abramović, who recently turned 71-years-old. “To appreciate the present, we should really look to the past.”

Female artists had a tough time breaking into the art world in the 1970s, when performance art wasn’t taken seriously by a male-dominated majority. “I have a 50 year career right now and for the past 40 years, performance art wasn’t considered art,” said Abramović. “I had incredible trust in my own intuition to survive and I believed in performance art so strongly. You can never give up, but when you don’t give up for 50 years? Wow, that’s a long stretch. I never stopped working.”

Abramović, whose collaborators include Jay-Z and Lady Gaga, had her acclaimed Museum of Modern Art retrospective, The Artist is Present, where she sat in the museum for over 700 hours, in 2010. Her recent retrospective at the Louisiana Museum in Denmark called The Cleaner was about cleaning past memories, while those same memories have been rehashed in her recent memoir, Walk Through Walls.

But 40 years ago, she was just a struggling artist on the European festival circuit getting ripped off by galleries who still haven’t paid her.

Her art from that time reflects her struggle. In this exhibition, some of the early performance pieces on view include Lips of Thomas, where she cuts a five-pointed star on her stomach with a razor blade, then whips herself and lies down on a cross made of ice blocks.

Another piece is Rhythm 0, where Abramović placed 72 objects on a table – including a loaded gun and razor blades – and invited the audience to do as they please with her. They cut her clothes off with razor blades, touched her intimately, slashed her throat, sucked her blood and pointed the gun to her head with her own finger on the trigger.

“It was related to the idea of how far the public can go, whether they will kill the performer or not,” she said. “I really think they can.”

It wasn’t about being taken advantage of as a woman, says the artist. “I never take the gender into consideration for the artwork,” she said. “Art doesn’t have a gender – there are only two categories to me, good art and bad art.”

But with the #MeToo movement and the sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, sexual misconduct and harassment allegations have surfaced in the art world, from Artforum magazine publisher Knight Landesman to New York artist Chuck Close and photographers Mario Testino and Bruce Weber.

“I think it’s terrible and it’s so sad these people didn’t have the courage to say something in the moment when it was happening,” said Abramović. “I would not wait 20 years to say such a thing. If I could say something to all these people, don’t wait. It’s very important to have courage in your life; otherwise you have a supressed life, which is terrible.”

While her own performance work is linked with shamanistic rituals, the far right have misunderstood her art as Satanism. Her work surfaced during the Pizzagate scandal of 2016, where one of Abramovic’s emails to Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta (brother of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta) refers to a “Spirit Cooking,” which is the name of an artwork she made in 1996. It was assumed to be an occult ritual.

“People can so easily put labels, we are afraid of everything,” she said. “I talk openly on every single subject in my work, it’s very important to understand it and put it in the right context.”

One spiritual leader she does admire is the Dalai Lama, whose lectures have taught her to forgive. “It’s the only way we can stop the wars in the world,” she said, “if we learn to forgive.”

But looking back on her old self, the Abramović of the 1970s, she sees someone totally different. “I look back and think ‘wow, this kid had a really big vision,’ bigger than I have now,” she said. “I don’t look back much but I try to connect points to answer the same question, ‘what is my function in this world?’”

It ties into the Abramović Method, a series of meditative exercises she created, which attempts to test physical agility and answer philosophical questions around life and death. “I am not interested in small questions,” she says. “The Dalai Lama helped me so much.”

Serendipity also helped out, apparently, as it helped her forgive her former creative collaborator and romantic partner Ulay (born Frank Uwe Laysiepen), who she split with in 1988. He sued Abramović in 2015 for $300,000 for art sales of their co-authored artworks and won. Unexpectedly, the artists found each other in India at a month-long artist’s retreat last year.

“It was so important for us that we really became friends and I learned the forgiveness,” she said. “All this bullshit, it was a learning process and we made important work and this is all that matters.”

Now, Abramović and Ulay are good friends who text each other every day. “All the hate is gone,” she said. “I’ve never been there.”

Even at 71, she doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. “I am still performing,” she said. “It’s crazy because my generation is gone.”

With an exhibition schedule booked to 2024, she is working on new artwork for a solo show at the Royal Academy of Art in London in 2020. In the meantime, she is maintaining her roving project, the Marina Abramović Institute, which hosts temporary projects across the globe.

But not without controversy. The plan was to build an institute in a converted theatre in Hudson, New York, which would be designed by architect Rem Koolhaas. But after crowdfunding $660,000 on Kickstarter – and refusing to return the funds to the backers, though they each got their promised pledge rewards – she backed out of the plan, as building costs were estimated at $31m.

“I don’t want to spend the time to fundraise because it’s more important to make projects around the world,” said Abramović. “More than a million people are participating at my institute and this is our function, the institute is alive more than ever but not based to one building.”

Since its conception, the institute has traveled to Athens, Kiev and São Paulo. It will visit for the inaugural Bangkok Biennial later this year.

From an artist who has cut herself and made videos where she has screamed for hours, one wouldn’t expect Abramović to be so focused on love. But after confronting her fears, her approach has changed.

“You know what?” asks Abramović in her red pyjamas. “In life, honestly, love is the first thing. Not to just love the work but to love yourself, and the moment you’re in love – the world is such a great place.”

If you connect the dots of the NCMEC, ICMEC, Big Pharma, Thorn, The McCain Institute, Rothschild’s, CIA, Hillary Clinton, Obama’s, Jeff Koon’s, Richard Branson, The Entire Podesta Family, The Podesta Group, Orphanages, CPS, Amber Alert System, MissingKids, Friends of the Orphans & the likes of Terry Richardson what do you find in common???

These along with many others have been mentioned in sentences with words like: Child Victimization, Advocacy, Pedophilia, Child Trafficking, Exploitation, Abuse, Abductions.

The International Center for Missing & Exploited Children held its first Board of Directors meeting in May 1998. It was officially launched in April 1999 by Hillary Clinton, then-First Lady of the United States, Lynn de Rothschild and Cherie Blair, wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING & EXPLOITED CHILDREN website states: 1 in 10 children under the age of 18 will be sexually abused this year in the United States and in 2016, there were more than 465,000 reports of missing children in the U.S. (465,676 to be exact). Their role in the “MASSIVE” child trafficking and exploitation network both in the United States & globally is widely known.

The Board of Directors is a who’s who among elites. Including the likes of Sir Richard Branson, who was one of the founding sponsors & his mom Eve Branson, who was a founding board member in 1999 with Lady Rothschild, Ms Blair and then First Lady Clinton and who served on first Board in 2005.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children began in 1984 and served as the national clearinghouse and resource center for families, victims, private organizations, law enforcement and the public on issues relating to missing and sexually exploited children. In the 33 years since beginning, their toll-free hotline has received more than 4.5 million calls. Of the approximate 20,000 reported runaways in 2016 alone, one in six were likely victims of child sex trafficking. Of those, 86 percent were in the care of social services when they went missing. The CyberTipline started in 1998 and has received more than 20 million reports. In 2016 the CyberTipline received 8.2 million reports, most of which related to: Apparent child sexual abuse images, Online enticement including “sextortion”, Child sex trafficking and Child sexual molestation.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, was created out of the publicity generated from the Adam Walsh disappearance and death back in 1981. The claim raised at the time before Congress was that there was no government-affiliated agency in existence to assist the parents of abducted children. The figures at the time portrayed the situation as grim, insisting that tens, if not hundreds of thousands of children a year were abducted by strangers. As it turned out, long-term abductions by strangers figured only in the tens per year. Since its inception, NCMEC has received millions of dollars each year from Congress. Presently, Congress allocates $50 million per year to the Center. But how is the money used? And how does NCMEC work? NCMEC describes itself as a Missing Children Clearinghouse, meaning that it disseminates information, but plays no active role in the actual recovery of missing children. Today, NCMEC has hundreds of staff and its salaries alone are running close to $30 million a year.

Why is the #NCMEC a private company? Why does our government fund them? Why is there a lack of transparency? 501c3 status NCMEC does no investigative work when a child goes missing; they offer no rewards for information, they received $50 million in federal funds last year from the federal government. This nonprofit needs to be investigated.

Another agency mentioned above is CPS. Child Protective Services is the name of a governmental agency in many states of the United States responsible for providing child protection, which includes responding to reports of child abuse or neglect. Some states use other names, often attempting to reflect more family-centered (as opposed to child-centered) practices, such as “Department of Children & Family Services” (DCFS). CPS is also known by the name of “Department of Social Services” (DSS) or simply “Social Services.” CPS/DCF is a department under a state’s Health and Human Services organization and is funded as such. In 1974, the efforts by the states culminated in the passage of the federal “Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act” (CAPTA; Public Law 93-247) providing federal funding for wide-ranging federal and state child-maltreatment research and services. This led to partial funding by the federal government as well as state funding.

Below are opinions expressed by families that CPS really does stand for Child PROFIT System and that they get paid big bonus money for every kid they steal from parents and put into the system.

Michael Minkoff, is another father who alleges that his children were unjustly taken by CPS. He claims CPS standards for seizing children aren’t just governed by whether they’re abused, but also whether they’re “marketable.” His claim is: “Do you know how many calls it took for someone to show up and take our beautiful white baby twin girls? One call. And CPS took them on the basis of one person’s testimony. And we were assumed guilty from the start. Three months later, the case was dismissed and not a single claim was upheld, yet LA County got three months worth of Federal money out of our kids, and so far, they got it with impunity. In fact, if it hadn’t been for God’s grace and good lawyers, we might have been fighting for much longer to no avail.” Read the rest at VicturusLibertas

Multiple federal acts and policies led up to President Clinton’s 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA), much of which guides current practice. The public relations campaign promoted it as a way to help abused and neglected children who languished in foster care for years, often being shuffled among dozens of foster homes, never having a real home and family. In a press release from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services dated November 24, 1999, it refers to “President Clinton’s initiative to double by 2002 the number of children in foster care who are adopted or otherwise permanently placed.” Changes in the Adoptions and Safe Families Act showed an interest in cosmetically shifting the emphasis towards children’s health and safety concerns and away from a policy of reuniting children with their birth parents without regard to prior abusiveness.

The United States Department of Health & Human Services administers Child Protective Services. To accompany the ASF Act, President Clinton requested, by executive memorandum, an initiative entitled Adoption 2002, to be implemented and managed by Health & Human Services. The initiative not only gives “cash adoption incentive bonuses” to the states, it also provides cash adoption subsidies to adoptive parents until the children turn eighteen. The below article includes much more on the financial side of adoptions as well.

The National Center for Policy Analysis, a private think tank, issued a report that stated: “The way the federal government reimburses States rewards a growth in the size of the program instead of the effective care of children.” Another incentive being promoted is the use of the Internet to make adoption easier. President Clinton directed HHS to develop an Internet site to “link children in foster care with adoptive families.” If you don’t find anything you like there, you can surf on over to the “Adopt Shoppe.” Government websites to “window shop” for children???

The article Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA): Adoption Bonuses: The Money Behind the Madness sheds a different light on this topic though.

Child “protection” is one of the biggest businesses in the country. We spend $12 billion a year on it. The money goes to tens of thousands of a) state employees, b) collateral professionals; such as lawyers, court personnel, court investigators, evaluators and guardians, judges, and c) CPS/DSS contracted vendors such as counselors, therapists, more “evaluators”, junk psychologists, residential facilities, foster parents, adoptive parents, MSPCC, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, YMCA, etc. There isn’t room to list all of the people in these state who have a job, draw a paycheck, or make their profits off the kids in CPS/DSS custody.

ASFA encouraged a take-the-child-and-run mentality on the frontlines of child welfare. Thousands more families, overwhelmingly poor and disproportionately families of color, were destroyed by wrongful removal of the children. Instead of reducing the foster care population, ASFA increased it, trapping thousands more children in a system that, according to one major study, churns out walking wounded four times out of five.

ASFA effectively turned the child welfare system into the ultimate middle-class entitlement: Step right up and take a poor person’s child for your very own. And when the army of childless yuppies didn’t show up to adopt in anywhere near the numbers predicted, ASFA created a generation of “legal orphans” with no ties to birth parents and no adoptive homes either — probably at least 100,000 more such “legal orphans” than had ASFA not become law.

It happened because ASFA was built on a foundation of false premises:

False premise #1: Any parent who loses a child to foster care is a sadist, a brute, or a hopeless addict who “puts drugs ahead of the children.”

 Fact: Far more common are cases in which family poverty is confused with neglect; other cases fall between the extremes. So it’s no wonder that two massive studies involving more than 15,000 typical cases found that children left in their own homes fared better even than comparably-maltreated children placed in foster care.

False premise #2: An earlier federal law, passed in 1980, requiring “reasonable efforts” to keep families together supposedly led to some children being left in dangerous homes and other children languishing in foster care.

 Fact: The law did nothing to change the federal financial incentives that encourage foster care and discourage better alternatives. So the number of children taken from their parents kept right on increasing in almost every year after that law was passed. And though known cases of child abuse peaked in 1993, entries into foster care still kept going up. The reason children languished in foster care was the failure to make reasonable efforts to keep families together.

This link explains the business in much greater details than we have here. Basically everything they can think of to increase the supply of kids for foster care and adoption has been done it seems. Pay particular attention to the Subsidy Profile section as the numbers are astounding compared to the costs of keeping the children in their “natural homes”.

As we continue down the list of agencies and entities listed above, we embarge on the AmberAlert / AlertSense program. “The agency that coordinates the AMBER Alert program on the national level, the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, has asked the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) to manage the AMBER Alert Secondary Distribution Program.” According to the AmberAlert.gov website, 21 Years of Progress in Recovering Abducted Children has resulted in 868 successful recoveries. Yes we are grateful for every recovered child, but after 21 years one would think the numbers would be much greater.

This portion was directly from the legislative section of their website: (h) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this section $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2004. Such amounts shall remain available until expended

An interesting find was that the Alertsense website lists Laura Gayler/Silsby as VP of marketing. Who remembers Silsby and the Haiti Abduction saga? Let’s touch on that for just a moment:

Media continued to focus on the fate of the U.S. missionaries in Haiti being held on trafficking charges, speculating on — and criticizing — their release. Under the headline, “Child appropriators will be released,” centrist Critica clearly expressed its objection, adding a subheadline, “The judicial decision contributes to legitimizing the presence and action of U.S. troops in Haiti following the earthquake.” The paper adds that Laura Silsby, the leader of the U.S. missionaries, had claimed she planned to build an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, but authorities in the country said she never submitted an application for this purpose. Pagina 12 appeared more objective; however, it reported that while the Americans claimed to be on a humanitarian mission, “it transcended that the children were not orphans and that most were delivered to the U.S. missionaires with their parents’ authorization.”

 that none of the children were orphans.

 were delivered to the missionaries by “distant relatives” or “orphanages

 that had collapsed in the quake,” adding that “‘[t]hey are very precious

Syracuse University’s annual Mirror Awards, which honors reporting on the media, agreed Thursday that the two organizations would share this year’s award for best in-depth and enterprise reporting. The award is for stories about disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.

The two organizations were also honored together in April with the Pulitzer Prize for public service for a broader entry that included other stories about sexual harassment.

“This is a good example of why competition can be really healthy,” said Times reporter Jim Rutenberg, who shared the award with Jodi Kantor, Megan Twohey, Ellen Gabler, Susan Dominus, Rachel Abrams and Steve Eder. Ronan Farrow was the honoree at The New Yorker.

Syracuse saluted Irin Carmon and Amy Brittain from the Washington Post for their story about sexual misconduct allegations against news anchor Charlie Rose. Noting at an industry lunch that it took seven years for the story to appear after she first heard stories about Rose, Carmon said there was a lot of resistance to reporting stories on the topic.

665,"Vice President Mike Pence tweeted, and soon deleted, a photo on Friday showing him with a police officer who wore a patch with a “Q” patch, signaling belief in the QAnon conspiracy, prominently displayed on his uniform. QAnon is an internet-based baseless anti-government conspiracy theory that has been pushing the lie that President Donald Trump is in cahoots with military officials to target members of what they consider to be the government’s “deep state,” who they believe run pedophile rings.

The conspiracy theory started on internet message board 4Chan with mysterious, cryptic posts by a person known as “Q,” who followers believe to be a highly-placed government official. QAnon is responsible for, among others, the absurd Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which led to a shooting inside a Washington, DC, pizzeria in December 2016. The suspect, a follower of QAnon, fired three shots with an AR-15, although no one was injured; he was sentenced to four years in prison. The assailant said he was attempting to save children trapped in a sex-slave ring, which he believed to be led by Hillary Clinton and her campaign advisor, John Podesta.

Followers of QAnon believe Trump is on a mission to rid the government of these pedophiles, and supporters have been seen at Trump rallies with shirts and signs with the letter “Q” on them, a signal they subscribe to the conspiracy.

The Vice President’s office took the tweet down, telling BuzzFeed that they did not want to promote the conspiracy theory. They replaced it with a tweet that did not include the controversial photo.

The officer was identified by BuzzFeed as Sgt. Matt Patten, who has been employed by the Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida for 27 years.

The same negative view of Trump may be found all around the American TV landscape. Since CNN went on air in 1980, a variety of TV stations and news channels large and small have arisen on cable TV. The cable channels do not compete for the same broad audience as the original three large TV networks in the USA (CBS, NBC, and ABC). Rather, they direct themselves at different viewer segments and deliver programs catering to specific interests: sports, music videos, animal programs, sci-fi, and history. If there is an audience with special television needs, you can be sure there is a cable channel to cater to that need: The market will provide. The same goes for biased news coverage.

The cable news channel with the largest TV audience in 2016 was Fox News.6 The station has obtained a monumental commercial success by producing and offering biased news coverage for a large audience of right-wing conservatives. It is not hard to argue and demonstrate that Fox News does not quite live up to its slogan of being “fair and balanced.” An example of this bias is the coverage of the party conventions in 2004, when the channel was completely uncritical of the Republican candidates. They procured more speech time and visibility than the Democrats who were routinely criticized by the hosts (Morris and Francia 2009).

News production for a specific audience so biased that it is possible to document may all the same be a very good business indeed. Others have taken note of that, and at the other end of the spectrum, left-wing channel MSNBC tries to imitate the concept. MSNBC likewise has an issue with balance and fairness at the other end of the ideological spectrum.

Cable TV has added to the polarization of the media supply and consumption. Political groups now watch different, biased news channels and programs. Nonetheless, Trump managed to fall out of favor with everyone. Even Fox News turned on him when he launched a misogynist attack on one of their hosts, Megyn Kelly, in which Trump was strongly insinuating that Kelly was driven by female hormones (to put it mildly). Ironically, his attack was a response to her critical questioning pertaining to his view of women.

No matter how critical TV channels ranging from Fox to MSNBC were of Trump’s candidacy, this did not make them cover him any less up to the elections. He got the mass of attention all the same.7 Whether they liked him or not, the story was simply too good to miss out on. Trump’s spectacular campaign attracted too many viewers to turn off the cameras and the Trump talk. Even though the established mass news media were generally opposed to Trump’s politics, he had stronger forces on his side.

( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The bizarre rumors began with a leaked email referring to Hillary Clinton and sinister interpretations of pizza parties. It morphed into fake online news stories about a child sex trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats operating out of a Washington, D.C., restaurant.

On Sunday, it culminated in violence when police say a North Carolina man fired an assault rifle inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant as he attempted to “self-investigate” the conspiracy theory known in the Twitterverse as “Pizzagate.”

No one was hurt and the man was arrested. But the shooting alarmed those from neighboring businesses all the way to the White House about the real life dangers of fake news on the internet. One of those people posting on the conspiracy theory is the son of President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed national security adviser.

On Monday, White House Spokesman Josh Earnest, asked about the shooting, said, “There’s no denying the corrosive effect that some of these false reports have had on our political debate, and that’s concerning in a political context. It’s deeply troubling that some of those false reports could lead to violence.”

Edgar Maddison Welch, 28 of Salisbury, North Carolina, was arrested Sunday afternoon outside the popular eatery in an affluent neighborhood of the nation’s capital, police said. At his initial appearance Monday in D.C. Superior Court, Welch was ordered held pending a hearing scheduled for Thursday. The public defender he was assigned didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Court records made public Monday state Welch fired an AR-15 assault rifle multiple times inside the restaurant but later walked out with his hands up and unarmed, leaving his weapons inside. He told police “he had read online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there.” He said he “was armed to help rescue them” and “surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.”

Welch was charged on multiple counts, including assault with a dangerous weapon. Authorities recovered the AR-15 assault rifle and a handgun from the restaurant, court paperwork said. Police said an additional weapon was recovered from his vehicle.

One of Welch’s friends told The Washington Post she doesn’t think he intended to shoot anyone.

“He most likely really believes the conspiracy theory,” said Kathy Sue Holtorf, 29, who lives in California and works as a film producer. “He’s a good guy with the best of intentions. He probably saw himself as more on a hero mission to save children than anything else.”

Holtorf produced a nine-minute short called “Mute” that was written by Welch and they both appeared as victims of vampires in a slasher movie. She said Welch dabbled, but “never wanted to become an actor.” Holtorf described Welch as “a well-educated man” and “not a conspiracy nut,” saying he would talk about his daughters and how proud he was of them.

His aunt, Tajuana Tadlock, described Welch to The Washington Post as passionate and tenderhearted and a person who loves his family and his children. She said the family hasn’t been able to talk to him so they don’t know “what got him to this level.”

“Maddison is a sweet young man with a big heart,” said, his aunt. “We are all in shock right now. We are still trying to get our minds around what happened. This is totally out of character for him.”

The precise origins of the conspiracy theory Welch said he went to investigate are murky, though it seems to have started gaining momentum in the week before the election. Some elements trace back to hacked emails from Clinton Chief of Staff John Podesta that were released by Wikileaks that refer to pizza parties, with online commentators speculating that “pizza party” is a code word for something more nefarious. By Nov. 3, Comet Ping Pong — so named because patrons can play ping pong on tables in the back of restaurant — had been pulled into the conspiracy.

“Let me state unequivocally: These stories are completely and entirely false, and there is no basis in fact to any of them. What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences,” Comet’s owner, James Alefantis, said in a statement Sunday night.

At least one person who isn’t ready to give up on the conspiracy theory is prominently connected to Trump’s transition team. Michael Flynn Jr. is an adviser to his father, Michael Flynn, whom Trump selected to serve as national security adviser. Flynn Jr. has sent numerous posts on Twitter about the Pizzagate conspiracy theories. Flynn Jr., who has accompanied his father to presidential transition meetings inside Trump Tower and lists the presidential transition website as part of his Twitter bio, tweeted Sunday night that, “Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it’ll remain a story.”

Trump’s team had no immediate response to questions about the conspiracy theory or the younger Flynn’s role in the presidential transition.

On Monday, at an address listed for Welch in Salisbury, a woman drove out as a reporter was approaching and asked him to leave. She then hammered a “no trespassing” sign on a stand by the private driveway.

Comet Ping Pong was closed Monday, but neighbors brought flowers and cards to the storefront saying “We support Comet” and “we love you and stand by you.”

Wiktoria Skrzypinska lives a few blocks from Comet. She said she had heard the rumors about Comet but was shocked to learn that somebody had become so enmeshed in the conspiracy theory to enter the restaurant with an assault rifle.

“I guess we all knew it was fake. It was so obvious I didn’t even bother with it,” she said.

528,"John Podesta's brother Tony has cut a deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to testify in the Russian hacking investigation in return for immunity.

Tony Podesta was granted immunity by Mueller to give evidence against Paul Manafort in the ongoing probe into interference by Russia in the 2016 presidential election, Fox News' Tucker Carlson reported.

Podesta's brother was head of Hillary Clinton's campaign run, and both John Podesta and HRC's emails were leaked.

Since losing the election, Democrats have been pushing the ""Russian hacking"" narrative to suggest that Trump was working with Russia to steal the election from Clinton.

The leak of John Podesta's emails in 2016 triggered the Pizzagate scandal after the conversations suggested high-level Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and the Podesta brothers, were part of an elite pedophile ring.

The allegations shone a light on Tony Podesta's controversial art collection that almost exclusively features child abuse and torture.

Fox News reports: Podesta is the founder of the Podesta Group and brother of John Podesta, who was chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.

The Podesta Group reportedly worked with Manafort -- a former chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign -- to lobby on behalf of Ukrainian interests in the United States, without properly registering at the time under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), Carlson said.

Manafort and the group worked on a campaign called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, the Washington Times reported.

""In other words, for a near identical crime, Bill and Hillary's friend could escape and emerge completely unscathed while Paul Manafort may rot in jail,"" Carlson said.

Podesta did not register as a foreign agent under FARA, Carlson said in a segment last October.

Mueller is also offering immunity to five potential witnesses in the upcoming trial of Manafort, the Washington Examiner reported.

Mueller's team is requesting ""use immunity,"" which is a limited type of immunity, the publication reported, citing court documents filed Tuesday.

The five people have not been charged or identified publicly with the case, prosecutors for Mueller’s team said, according to the Examiner.

Tony Podesta resigned from his lobbying group in October in response to Mueller’s investigation of the firm, the report said.

The firm was reportedly closed by the end of last year.

The special counsel’s office did not immediately respond for comment.

Manafort is accused of multiple financial crimes in connection with lobbying work he performed in Ukraine.

855,"The £75m banker, his stunning wife and a tryst with an England footballer: The truth about Diana Jenkins



There is a question no interviewer has ever dared to ask the formidable Diana Jenkins. But it is surely one that TV's mischievous Mrs Merton would have felt compelled to put to her: 'So, Diana, what was it that first attracted you to Britain's highest paid financier?' 



Such a line of inquiry seems particularly pertinent following Mrs Jenkins's stinging attack on London society in the pages of Tatler magazine. 



Pictured at her Malibu mansion in a Swarovski crystal and silk jumpsuit (in the past, she has stepped out in white fur and diamonds, and, on one occasion at least, a black mini-dress and thigh-length boots), she is sitting next to her husband Roger Jenkins, the former Barclays star banker who earned an estimated £75million in 2005 alone, and the father of her two children. 



He is 52. She is 36. The couple married ten years ago, after Mrs Jenkins - or Sanela Dijana Catic, as she was then - arrived in Britain as a penniless refugee from war-torn Bosnia. 



Her story reads like a Barbara Taylor Bradford epic: a classic rags-to-riches tale with the happiest of endings. But it seems that not everyone was convinced. 



In the eyes of London's rich wives, she says, she was viewed as an 'Eastern European mail-order bride'. 



They were the kind of women who judged a lady's worth by the size of the diamond ring on her finger. One day, at a charity gala, she recalled: 'I looked around the room and thought: ""What am I doing here with these people? I would rather be at home eating pizza in my pyjamas."" I felt really unfulfilled, empty, almost dirty.'

Which is why, Mrs Jenkins insists, she has moved to California. Yet might there be another reason, rightly or wrongly, for the snobbery and bitchiness she says she was subjected to? 



Mrs Jenkins has told of her struggle to forge a new life after fleeing to Britain in the early Nineties with no passport or money. She worked as a cleaner, waitress and babysitter, and ran a jewellery stall. 



There are, however, I have learned, certain elements that have been airbrushed from this stirring script. 



One intriguing incident in her past, for instance, unfolded in 2003 when Rio Ferdinand, the England and Manchester United footballer, was spotted enjoying the company of a group of young women (including some who described themselves as 'models') at London's Funky Buddha club. 



Among the circle was Diana Jenkins - in that black mini-dress and those thigh-length boots. 



What happened next was spread across two pages of a Sunday tabloid. Only you can't read about these events today - on the internet, for example - because Mrs Jenkins threatened to take legal action and the newspaper agreed to remove the article from its archives. 



This is normal practice if the facts of a story are disputed. On this occasion, however, Mrs Jenkins did not take legal action. Nevertheless, the 'exposé' was not returned to the cuttings library.

For all intents and purposes, it disappeared from circulation. Until now. We've managed to dig up an old copy and trace someone who was at the Funky Buddha that night. 



Mrs Jenkins, who rather loftily describes herself as an international businesswoman and philanthropist, was married when she and the other young women joined Ferdinand in the VIP lounge of the club.

All that evening, the footballer 'couldn't take his eyes off Diana', who was perched on his knee. And the feeling, it seems, was mutual. 'Rio couldn't keep his hands off her [Diana] all night,' the eyewitness recalls. 



'She was wearing a tiny black dress that barely covered her bottom. He loved it. Everyone was giving her [Diana] the eye, but she was only interested in Rio. He kissed and caressed her all night.' 



At one point, he whisked his companion on to the dance floor and they 'dirty danced' together. 



After four hours, Rio and his entourage went to another club, where the party continued to 4am. Afterwards, they clambered into a waiting stretch limousine. 



'Rio was sitting towards the front of the car while his pals were in the back so he could have some privacy with Diana,' says our mole in the car. The group were driven to Mrs Jenkins's London penthouse, arriving at 5am. Ferdinand left later in the day. 



A few days after, Mrs Jenkins flew off for a Christmas holiday in Rio de Janeiro with her husband. When the newspaper approached her about the story, Mrs Jenkins flatly denied it was true, and went so far as to claim she had been out of the country that night.

She also denied knowing Ferdinand. Just one problem. At that point, the newspaper played its trump card: its reporter had been in the limo and had witnessed everything. 



After that, there was no further complaint from Mrs Jenkins. Under different circumstances, we would not be re-living these events. But any embarrassment caused will illicit little sympathy. She has let it be known, through her lawyers, that she objects to being called a 'socialite wife'. 



Also, when asked about her husband in a recent interview, Mrs Jenkins is quoted as saying: 'It was, perhaps, more instant attraction for him than me. He's a very, very nice man. What people don't understand, I think, is that Roger really was, you could say, nobody when we met.' 



For the record, at that time, he was already a successful banker. By the time they married at Kensington and Chelsea town hall in 1999, Diana was heavily pregnant with their son Innis, now ten. (Their daughter, Eneya, was born three years later.)

They were living at his London penthouse, which he sold for £2.5 million in 2005. Not a bad return for a nobody. Mrs Jenkins' night on the town with Rio Ferdinand is far from the only colourful entry on her CV. 



In June, she was the subject of more gossip when she left a private party at The Punchbowl (the Mayfair pub owned by Guy Ritchie) with singer Justin Timberlake.

Her solicitors fired off letters, making it clear their client was not, as had been reported at the time, 'a fixture on the London party circuit', and was most definitely 'not having a relationship with Mr Timberlake', but 'returned home to her husband' after the party. 



Similar denials ensued last month following a showbusiness bash at the same venue. This time, Mrs Jenkins was seen leaving with Guy Ritchie himself. 



What is clear, from the Tatler article if nothing else, is that the Jenkinses enjoy a highly unconventional relationship, spending only six months of the year together at their Malibu mansion. 



There they enjoy the services of a 'house manager', to look after domestic arrangements, and a 'manny' (male nanny) to look after their son and a nanny to look after their daughter. 



The property, perched on the most exclusive stretch of Malibu clifftop, with a wooden staircase leading to a beach cabana, is worth more than £12million. 



The house is in Mrs Jenkins's name. The couple retain a grand Mayfair residence (worth more than £16million) off Berkeley Square, where the woman who - we were told by her lawyers - is 'not a fixture on the London party circuit', recently found time to mastermind a soiree to raise £10million for Darfur's refugees, with a guest list that included Matt Damon, Sir Michael Caine, Bono and Scarlett Johansson. 



This house, too, is in her name. Could it really be only just over a decade since Sanela Dijana Catic left the town of Alipasin Poye, a few miles from Sarajevo, where she grew up in a middle-class Muslim home? 



Her mother was an accountant and her father an economist. Their daughter was a graduate of the University of Sarajevo. When war broke out with Serbia, her family begged her to leave, fearing what would happen to her if she didn't. 



Unable to speak English, she started her London life working in a Covent Garden store earning £2 an hour. She managed to save up enough money to enrol for a degree in computer science at City University. 



In 1995, eight days before the war in Bosnia ended, she received a call telling her that her 21-year-old brother had been murdered. 'I almost died because I couldn't cope with the pain,' she says. 'So I reinvented myself for survival. That year, Sanela died and I became Diana.' 



Enter Roger Jenkins. They met, she says, at a gym in the City and it took him four months to persuade her to go on a date with him. No doubt this is true. After they married, one of the first things the new Mrs Jenkins did was to invite her Bosnian parents to join her in Britain. 



She also supports other members of her extended family. Roger is clearly besotted with his young wife and would, it seems, do almost anything to please her. 



'Will you stay married for ever?' he was asked during the Tatler interview. 'I think - I hope - I am with Diana for a very long time, a very long time,' he replied. And the lady herself? Her reply is, well, less gushing. 'I might be with him or I might not be with him. Who knows what tomorrow brings?' 



Mr Jenkins fully credits his wife with transforming him from a respectable banker to an international powerhouse, the head of Barclays' tax avoidance division and the highest-paid employee of a FTSE 100 company. 



And, naturally, Diana is more than happy to accept the credit - even for the deal that rescued her husband's employer at the height of the credit crunch.

It was Diana, apparently, who charmed the Qatari royal family into parting with billions to take a stake in Barclays at a crucial moment in the recent global banking crisis. 



This was the financial coup that thrust them both - he reluctantly, she exuberantly - into the public eye. After all, it is Mrs Jenkins who is in charge of what she and her husband call the 'Roger brand'. 



In fact, you could be forgiven for thinking, from various fawning interviews with Diana, that she is a self-made woman. 



True, she has launched a number of businesses, including a swimwear company, Avalon Fashions, which has a subsidiary in the U.S., and is registered in her name at Companies House in Cardiff. The British accounts show a loss of more than £700,000 up to August 31, 2008.

Her latest venture is a new line of energy drinks, one of which promises a more accomplished sexual climax. Since its launch in May, sales of the Neuro range (which are packed with 'vitamins, minerals, botanicals and amino acids' and took two years to perfect) have exploded in California, she says.

Jimmy Choo boss Tamara Mellon is a convert, giving up her lifelong addiction to Diet Coke in favour of NeuroSonic.

Not all the reviews have been favourable, however. One dissatisfied customer described the drink as 'yak's p*** in a can'. But, then, there is no accounting for taste.

Mrs Jenkins was also behind a book, Room 23, in which she had persuaded dozens of celebrities to pose in faintly saucy poses in a suite in Beverly Hills' Peninsula Hotel to raise money for one of her charitable foundations. 



In it, Sharon Stone is trussed up in what looks like bondage gear, Minnie Driver is scoffing hamburgers on the loo, and there are a host of other film stars including Donald Sutherland, Dennis Hopper, Lindsay Lohan and George Clooney ushering a mystery blonde into the suite - Diana Jenkins herself.

In her biography on the Room 23 website, her financier husband does not even get a mention. 



What a fascinating and complex woman this is: beautiful, accomplished and at her ease among the international set. 



As she says: 'Money is a wonderful thing. I love to earn it, and I love to spend it. It can buy you freedom and it can most certainly bring you happiness.' 



And yet one wonders whether the Tatler interview was quite such a good idea. In the light of those intriguing airbrushed chapters in her past, it's not hard to imagine the reaction of the 'social girls' about whom she was so dismissive.",mainstream,M1890b,pizzagate
23,"Soon after Robert Bowers was named as a suspect in Saturday’s deadly mass killing of 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, his profile and recent posts on the controversial social media platform Gab.com made clear that anti-Semitism was his motive.

“Jews are the children of satan,” Bowers wrote on his profile page, while his most recent post, or “gab,” blamed the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), which provides services to refugee populations, for enabling “invaders” to “kill our people,” a sentiment that the Southern Poverty Law Center described as a “deeper conspiratorial worldview that cast Jews as the most urgent threat to the white race.” Shortly before Bowers burst through the synagogue doors and opened fire while shouting “all Jews must die,” he posted on Gab, “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.”

As news of Bowers’ Gab.com account spread, the two-year-old platform’s business relationships quickly began to crumble. Not long after the massacre, Gab posted a statement on its Medium page saying it “unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.” Soon after, their Medium account was suspended. On Saturday afternoon, PayPal banned Gab from its payment platform for “explicitly allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance,” according to The Verge.

On Saturday night, the cloud-hosting company Joylent announced that it would be suspending the platform as of Monday for violating their Terms of Service. Shortly thereafter, the payment processing site Stripe suspended the platform while it conducts an investigation, writing in an email notification that the platform had “not provided us sufficient evidence that Gab actually prevents violations of our policies.” By Sunday morning, GoDaddy had determined that Gab.com was in violation of their terms of service, and gave them 24 hours to find a new provider. For now, the platform is offline.

According to Gab CEO Andrew Torba, the site actually helped with the case, because after Bowers was named as the Pittsburgh shooting suspect, the platform took down his Gab.com profile and immediately began cooperating with the authorities.

“Because he was on Gab, law enforcement now have definitive evidence for a motive,” Torba wrote in an email to the New York Times. “They would not have had this evidence without Gab. We are proud to work with and support law enforcement in order to bring justice to this alleged terrorist.”

Gab.com launched in August 2016 as a “censorship-free” alternative to Twitter and Facebook, after the social media sites increased efforts to crack down on harassment and hate speech, including banning a number of white supremacist and far-right accounts. Gab.com looks and operates like a mashup between Twitter and Reddit — users blast out messages called “gabs,” which others can respond to, share, and vote up or down.

“We promote raw, rational, open, and authentic discourse online,” Torba told Wired in September 2016, a month after the platform launched. “We want everyone to feel safe on Gab, but we’re not going to police what is hate speech and what isn’t.”

While “everyone” may be welcome, Gab.com quickly became a safe space for those with extremist views on race, gender, sexual identity and immigration, including former Breitbart writer Milo Yiannopoulos, #Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and “crying Nazi” Christopher Cantwell. Though Gab.com has rules against posting child pornography, doxing and making violent or terrorist threats — they advise users to “try to be nice and kind to one another” — it has become an echo chamber for racist, antisemitic, homophobic, transphobic and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Gab.com has directly benefited from Twitter and Facebook’s attempts to crack down on abusive behavior and “fake news” — when Twitter permanently suspended a number of far-right accounts after the 2016 election, Torba bragged that Gab.com gained 60,000 new members in just over a week.

Now, ironically enough, Gab is using Twitter and Facebook to keep its users updated on the takedown — though Torba has said he expects they’ll soon be banned on those platforms as well. Their website has also gone dark, save for a defiant message on its website about being “under attack” and “systematically no-platformed,” vowing to work “around the clock to get Gab.com back online.”

“We have been smeared by the mainstream media for defending free expression and individual liberty for all people and for working with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served for the horrible atrocity committed in Pittsburgh,” the message reads. “Gab will continue to fight for the fundamental human right to speak freely.”",mainstream,M18b86,pizzagate

Kanye West's break from social media lasted all of seven days.

After a bizarre week that included a highly publicized meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office and a spontaneous trip to Uganda, West returned to Twitter to talk ""mind control.""

The controversial rapper opted out of social media last week after catching heat for an equally peculiar pro-Trump rant following his appearance on the season premiere of ""Saturday Night Live.""

In a series of Twitter videos shared Saturday, West gave his unfiltered thoughts on the negative effects of social media in a nine-minute live video of him talking directly to the camera.

""I just want to talk about mind control,"" West began. ""You know, when people try to influence you through social media and try to tell you what to do, or if you post something that's, like, positive on Instagram, it gets taken down if it's not a part of a bigger agenda.""

He continued: ""That's like mind control. That's the echo chamber. That's trying to control you based off of incentivizing you and based off of you getting enough likes. That's the poison that's happening with social media.""

West discussed his self-proclaimed genius-level IQ score (""Straight up Sigmund Freud, Tesla vibes""), his dislike of people telling him what to do (""Feel like they're touching my brain"") and compared the policing of his thoughts to a woman's right to consent (""She wants to be in control of her body and choose who she wants to give it to. ... I feel like that with my mind"").

""Imagine you, like, cut your skull open and somebody like touched your brain with their hand, how that would hurt you,"" West asked. ""That's how it hurts me when people try to tell me what to do when I'm going from my heart. Try to tell me what to say. This ain't programmed.""

The father of three says he's not crazy, as he's been portrayed: ""It's all part of a system to control your mind. To control my mind. To make me look like I'm crazy to you. I am not crazy. I can ramp up if I suffer from sleep deprivation.""

West said Twitter and Instagram are the least of his worries, adding that his fan base remains loyal.

""I'm not worried about any type of blog or social media. Y'all already saw it was a lie,"" he said. ""Social media told you that Hillary was gonna win and she didn't win. Social media told you that people didn't like me, but everybody loves me. Everybody loves Ye.""

1185,"In the editors’ note, Infowars said Mr. Fontaine later asked for the photo to be removed, but by that time, it had already been taken down.

But the short time it did appear on the site caused lasting damage, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Fontaine continues to be harassed and receive threats, the lawsuit said, and is seeking more than $1 million in damages.

Led by Mr. Jones, who has repeatedly asserted that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was “completely fake” and that the Sept. 11 terror attacks were an “inside job,” Infowars attracts millions of visitors every month with stories often based on unsupported claims and conspiracy theories. With little evidence, Infowars and Mr. Jones, the host of a popular radio show, have propagated wild allegations that they have ended up having to retract.

In March 2017, Mr. Jones apologized for spreading the hoax known as Pizzagate, which claimed that top Democratic officials operated a satanic child pornography ring in the basement of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington pizza restaurant. His apology came three months after a man motivated by the conspiracy theory fired a rifle inside the restaurant. In May 2017, Mr. Jones retracted several stories and issued an apology to Chobani Yogurt in order to resolve a lawsuit filed by the company for asserting that its Idaho factory, which employs refugees, was connected to a 2016 sexual assault of a child.

The shooting at Stoneman Douglas High, along with the student survivors who have since led impassioned rallies for restrictions on guns, quickly attracted the attention of far-right provocateurs. A month after the shooting, YouTube cracked down on some fringe groups whose conspiracy-theory videos had climbed the site’s “trending” list. YouTube issued a warning against Infowars, which had published a video that falsely claimed that a Stoneman Douglas student, David Hogg, was a “crisis actor.”

In the lawsuit, Mr. Bankston said that the Infowars story about the school gunman fell in line with the site’s overall strategy. “These sorts of reckless lies are what caused a disturbed individual to enter a pizzeria and begin firing,” he said.

“Alex Jones is no longer a gimmick or sideshow. His audience rivals that of major cable networks, yet he refuses to exercise the most basic journalistic integrity,” Mr. Bankston added on Tuesday. “What happened to Mr. Fontaine is the predictable result of the reckless practices Mr. Jones has fostered at Infowars.”",mainstream,M0c117,pizzagate
644,"On local news stations across the United States last month, dozens of anchors gave the same speech to their combined millions of viewers.

It included a warning about fake news, a promise to report fairly and accurately and a request that viewers go to the station's website and comment ""if you believe our coverage is unfair.""

It may not have seemed strange until viewers began to notice that the newscasters from Seattle to Phoenix to Washington sounded very similar. Stitched-together videos on social media showed them eerily echoing the same lines:

""The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media.""

""Some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias.""

""This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.""

The script came from Sinclair Broadcast Group, the country's largest broadcaster, which owns or operates 193 television stations.

Last week, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer published a copy of the speech and reported that employees at a local news station there, KOMO, were unhappy about the script. CNN reported on it on March 7 and said Scott Livingston, the senior vice president of news for Sinclair, had read almost the exact same speech for a segment that was distributed to outlets a year ago.

A union that represents news anchors did not respond immediately to requests for comment on Sunday.

Dave Twedell of the International Cinematographers Guild, who is a business representative for photojournalists (but not anchors) at KOMO in Seattle and KATU in Portland, Ore., said Sinclair told journalists at those stations not to discuss the company with outside news media.

Although it is the country's largest broadcaster, Sinclair is not a household name and viewers may be unaware of who owns their local news station. Critics have accused the company of using its stations to advance a mostly right-leaning agenda.

""We work very hard to be objective and fair and be in the middle,"" Mr. Livingston told The New York Times last year. ""I think maybe some other news organizations may be to the left of center, and we work very hard to be in the center.""

Sinclair regularly sends video segments to the stations it owns. These are referred to as ""must-runs,"" and they can include content like terrorism news updates, commentators speaking in support of President Trump or speeches from company executives like the one from Mr. Livingston last year.

But asking newscasters to present the material themselves is not something that Kirstin Pellizzaro, a doctoral candidate at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, remembered from her experience as a producer at a Sinclair-owned news station in Kalamazoo, Mich., from 2014 to 2015.

The station had to air ""must-run"" segments that came from Sinclair, which is based outside Baltimore. ""Some of them were a little slanted, a little biased,"" Ms. Pellizzaro said. ""Packages of this nature can make journalists uncomfortable.""

Sinclair representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. But Mr. Livingston told The Baltimore Sun that the script was meant to demonstrate Sinclair's ""commitment to reporting facts,"" adding that false stories ""can result in dangerous consequences,"" referring to the Pizzagate conspiracy as an example.

""We are focused on fact-based reporting,"" Mr. Livingston continued. ""That's our commitment to our communities. That's the goal of these announcements: to reiterate our commitment to reporting facts in a pursuit of truth.""

208,"The mass shootings targeting two bars in the German town of Hanau appear to be the latest in a series of global attacks motivated by white nationalist ideology, experts said.

The 43-year-old German man identified by authorities as the gunman also appeared to be obsessed with America, and with American conspiracy theories, according to online video and documents German police are investigating in connection with the attack.

One video, posted to YouTube under the same name as the website containing the gunman’s manifesto, described a conspiracy about the abuse and torture of children in secret locations in America.

Experts in global extremism said the comments paralleled several recent conspiracies popular with American far-right, including the “Pizzagate” conspiracy, which prompted an American gunman to invade a popular pizza restaurant in Washington, DC, in 2016, believing that it was the centre of a secret child abuse ring run by high-ranking Democratic politicians. In that incident, the gunman fired his military-style rifle inside the restaurant, but no one was injured.

The Hanau attack is evidence that “conspiracy theories that are circulated by Americans in the United States, and through message boards that are predominantly American, do have an impact in other places,” said Dr Joan Donovan, a expert in technology and online extremism at Harvard University.

While no early evidence emerged linking the alleged Hanau attacker to established extremist groups or individuals, analysts said that both the online manifesto and the nine people the gunman chose to murder made it clear that his attack was part of a ongoing pattern of white supremacist terror.

“He targeted particular places where he knew he would find migrants,” said Marilyn Mayo, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. “In his actions, he went to target the groups that he thought were detrimental to Germany and destroying German society and culture.”

The nine people killed at two different shisha bars in Hanau were all from immigrant backgrounds, many of them Turkish nationals. Early reports suggested that one of the victims may have been a 35-year-old pregnant mother, and that employees at the bars targeted were also among the dead. People of Turkish background make up Germany’s single largest ethnic minority.

German authorities have described the gunman as being motivated by a “deeply racist mindset,” and are investigating the shootings as an act of domestic terrorism.

The author of the online postings associated with the attack “talked about the achievements of the German people versus nonwhite immigrants,” and “crimes committed by nonwhite immigrants,” including how “Germans who are complacent about it are part of the problem,” Mayo said. This fixation on “crimes committed by nonwhite immigrants” is a central preoccupation of mainstream racist politicians in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe, as well as previous white nationalist killers.

“What we have occurring now is white supremacy integrated on a global scale,” said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.

The internet has helped “nationalist” extremists connect across borders and find common cause, advancing “the idea that if you act on and commit violence in one country, it’s for the good of the white race globally,” Donovan, the Harvard expert on online extremism, said.

Unlike the manifestos associated with previous white power attacks, the online postings being investigated in relation to the Hanau murders are rambling, with references to mind control and persistent delusions, and no direct homages to previous white nationalist attacks or attackers.

The postings also include references “different American and Canadian New Age conspiracy theorists, and researchers who believe in alien abductions and UFOs,” Mayo said.

Experts noted that the online Hanau manifesto also included a description of the writer’s feelings of alienation from women and inability to find a partner, echoing misogynistic talking points made by the perpetrators of recent mass murders targeting women in the United States and Canada. Like many American mass shootings, the Hanau attack has a link to domestic violence: authorities said the shooter went home and shot his mother to death before killing himself.

Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Extremism, said that many perpetrators of “mass symbolic violence” have multiple factors driving them, some primary and some secondary, including ideological motivations, revenge or personal benefit, and emotional or psychological problems.

Researchers have found people with serious mental illnesses are more likely to become a victim of violence than a perpetrator of violence, and that other factors, particularly previous violent behavior, is a much better predictor of extreme violence than mental health issues.

Within Germany, the Hanau attack follows the murder of a local German politician who had spoken out in defence of refugees and another mass shooting attack on a synagogue and a kebab shop in Halle, which left two people dead. The Halle shootings would likely have claimed more lives had the attacker not used handmade firearms which malfunctioned during the attack.

Globally, white nationalist attackers have targeted synagogues in the United States and Germany; mosques in England, Norway, and Christchurch, New Zealand; and a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, near the border between the United States and Mexico. Some attackers have described migrants and immigrants as “invaders,” as well as elaborating on the belief that a range of enemies, from Jewish people to feminists to leftists, are conspiring against the white race.

In ideologically motivated attacks, “the violence is used to get people to go back and look at the manifesto,” Donovan said, and when online platforms make it easy to share manifestos or even live-streamed footage of the attack, “We’re gong to continue to see that same tactic over and over again.”

But Donovan said that she had seen some early evidence that on Twitter, at least, the Hanau gunman’s manifesto, or messages celebrating his attack, had not spread in the same way as the footage of the attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, last March, which left 51 people dead.

Changes in Twitter’s policies, the disarray and de-platforming of certain white supremacist groups, and the German media’s practice of not using an attacker’s full name in news coverage are among the factors that might have contributed to this positive development, Donovan said.

Yet “QAnon: An Invitation to the Great Awakening,” a book pushing wacky conspiracy theories, has become an Amazon AMZN, best seller, cracking the top 75 among books sold on the site in recent days, according to NBC News.

The book, which says it was written by a dozen “anonymous Q followers, decoders and citizen journalists known collectively as Where We Go One We Go All (WWG1WGA),” claims that Democrats murder and eat children and that the government created AIDS, polio and Lyme disease. Then there’s the belief that the world is run by a Satanic cabal led by Hillary Clinton.

There’s more. So much more. But we’ll leave it there.

QAnon emerged from the dark corners of the internet and into the national spotlight thanks primarily to supporters of Donald Trump who would show up at his rallies wearing clothes and holding signs referencing the “Q” conspiracy.

Key Words:Hillary Clinton says ‘Pizzagate’ shows how fake-news ‘epidemic’ puts real lives at risk

Mike Rothschild, a conspiracy-theory expert, told NBC that the book is just another way for the QAnon movement to cash in on its gullible followers, calling it “a bold new step in the endless grift at the heart of Q.”

Nevertheless, the book keeps selling and racking up questionable glowing reviews, which Jason Kint, CEO of the trade association Digital Content Next, chalks up to manipulation and the lack of oversight on Amazon’s part.

“To be clear, they absolutely shouldn’t be censoring the availability of books like this,” Kite explained to NBC. “But the fact we’re left only with the publisher’s own description of the book and a clearly gamed set of 5-star reviews — how is the average shopper supposed to know this is toxic garbage?”",mainstream,M19c33,pizzagate
1169,"Clinton is furious that Comey, then the FBI director, publicly revealed the re-opening of the secret email server investigation just before election day - and has said so time after time after time.

Comey's entire organization does not escape her wrath.

'The FBI wasn't the Federal Bureau of Ifs or Innuendoes. Its job was to find out the facts,' she writes in What Happened.

'There's no doubt in my mind that Putin wanted me to lose and wanted Trump to win,' she told USA Today in September last year while promoting What Happened.

It was hardly a new theme. As early as December the New York Times obtained audio in which she told her donors: 'Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election.'

Putin's entire apparatus gets a name-check. In May she told the Codecon convention how '1,000 Russian agents' had filled Facebook with 'fake news'.

She told NPR 'my path toward November was being disrupted with Russians'.

The 'transparency website' is consistently ranked along with Comey by Clinton at the top of her blame list.

She told NPR : 'Unfortunately the Comey letter, aided to great measure by the Russian WikiLeaks, raised all those doubts again.'

And she writes of its founder Julian Assange in What Happened: 'In my view, Assange is a hypocrite who deserves to be held accountable for his actions.'

'You put yourself in the position of a low information voter, and all of a sudden your Facebook feed, your Twitter account is saying, ""Oh my gosh, Hillary Clinton is running a child trafficking operation in Washington with John Podesta."",' she told the Codecon convention in May.

'Well you don't believe it but this has been such an unbelievable election, you kind of go, 'Oh maybe I better look into that.''

'We have an electoral college problem. It's an anachronism,' she told Vox.

'I think it's important that we learn the real lessons from this last campaign because the forces that we are up against are not just interested in influencing our elections and our politics, they're going after our economy and they're going after our unity as a nation,' she told Codecon in May.

'What is hard for people to really accept - although now after the election there's greater understanding - is that there are forces in our country - put the Russians to one side - who have been fighting rear guard actions for as long as I've been alive because my life coincided with the Civil Rights movement, with the women's rights movement, with anti-war protesting, with the impeachment.

EVERYONE WHO ASSUMED SHE WOULD WIN

'I was the victim of a very broad assumption that I was going to win,' she told the Codecon convention.

Clinton says polls in key states did not serve her.

'I think polling is going to have to undergo some revisions in how they actually measure people,' she told the Codecon convention.

'How they reach people. The best assessments as of right now are that the polling was not that inaccurate, but it was predominantly national polling and I won nationally.'

Clinton has two beefs with Obama: one of them being that he won two terms. Clinton says that succeeding an incumbent is almost impossible for a Democrat.

'No non-incumbent Democrat had run successfully to succeed another two-termer since Vice President Martin Van Buren won in 1836,' she writes in What Happened.

But she also says his response to the Russian campaign of interference wasn't enough.

'I do wonder sometimes about what would have happened if President Obama had made a televised address to the nation in the fall of 2016 warning that our democracy was under attack,' she writes in What Happened.

'I believe absent Comey, I might've picked up 1 or 2 points among white women,' she told Vox in September.

'White woman... are really quite politically dependent on their view of their own security and their own position in society what works and doesn't work for them.'

'What happened in my election is I was on the way to winning white women until former director of the FBI Jim Comey dropped that very ill-advised letter on Oct. the 28th and my numbers just went down,' she said in a March 2018 speech in India.

'All of a sudden white women who were going to vote for me, and frankly standing up to the men in their lives and the men in their work places were being told, ""She's going to jail, you don't want to vote for her. It's going to be terrible you can't vote for that."" It stopped my momentum and it decreased my vote enough. Because I was ahead and I was winning and I thought I had fought my way back. '

The newspaper was blamed as early as May at the Codecon conference in Rancho Palos Verde, California.

She singled out its managing editor Dean Baquet - the paper's most senior editor - and said of coverage of her email issue under his direction: 'They covered it like it was Pearl Harbor.'

Biden could have run against her and didn't. But Clinton writes: 'Joe Biden said the Democratic Party in 2016 'did not talk about what it always stood for—and that was how to maintain a burgeoning middle class.'

'I find this fairly remarkable, considering that Joe himself campaigned for me all over the Midwest and talked plenty about the middle class.'

'His attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump's 'Crooked Hillary' campaign,' she writes in What Happened.

'I don't know if that bothered Bernie or not.'

'Some of his supporters, the so-called Bernie Bros, took to harassing my supporters online. It got ugly and more than a little sexist,' she writes in What Happened.

'I thought, at end of day, people would say, look, we do want change, and we want the right kind of change, and we want change that is realistic and is going to make difference in my life and my family's life and my paycheck,' she told Vox.

'That's what I was offering. And I didn't in any way want to feed into this, not just radical political argument that was being made on other side, but very negative cultural argument about who we are as Americans.'

Asked by CNN's Christine Amanpour at the Women for Women International event in new York in May if misogyny was to blame she said: 'Yes, I do think it played a role.'

'When you have a presidential campaign and the total number of minutes on TV news, which is still how most people get their information, covering all of our policies, climate change, anything else was 32 minutes, I don't blame voters,' she told The View.

'They don't get a broad base of information to make decision on. The more outrageous you are, the more inflammatory you are, the higher the ratings are.'

Hillary does not do Netflix and chill - or if she does, she doesn't find it very relaxing.

'Eight of the top 10 political documentaries on Netflix were screeds against President Obama and me,' she claimed at the Codecon convention.

'If you look at Facebook the vast majority of the news items posted were fake. They were connected to as we now know the 1,000 Russian agents who were involved in delivering those messages,' she told Codecon.

Usually mentioned in the same breath as Facebook, the micro-blogging site is seen by Clinton as one of the reasons for her loss.

She told the Codecon convention in may that Trump had a method in his tweets.

'They want to influence your reality. That to me is what we're up against, and we can't let that go unanswered,' she said.

'Through content farms, through an enormous investment in falsehoods, fake news, call it what you will - lies, that's a good word too - the other side was using content that was flat out false,' she told the Codecon convention in May.

'They were conveying this weaponized information and the content of it, and they were running, y'know there's all these stories, about y'know, and you know I've seen them now, and you sit there and it looks like you know sort of low level CNN operation, or a fake newspaper.'

'You had Citizens United come to its full fruition.' she told Codecon in May.

'So unaccountable money flowing in against me, against other Democrats, in a way that we hadn't seen and then attached to this weaponized information war.

'American journalists who eagerly and uncritically repeated whatever WikiLeaks dished out during the campaign could learn from the responsible way the French press handled the hack of Macron,' she writes in What Happened.

Now-president Macron had a massive tranche of his emails hacked and released shortly before the French voted. Many outlets did not report on their contents.

'Provided the untrue stories,' she told the Codecon convention in May.

'I set up my campaign and we have our own data operation. I get the nomination. So I'm now the nominee of the Democratic Party. I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party,' Clinton said told the Codecon convention in May.

'I mean, it was bankrupt. It was on the verge of insolvency. Its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong. I had to inject money into it.'

The Republicans were far better prepared for a campaign than the Democrats she claimed, when it came to money and data, telling the Codecon convention: 'So Trump becomes the nominee and he is basically handed this tried and true, effective foundation.'

The data-targeting firm ultimately owned by Robert Mercer, the billionaire Breitbart backer, and his family, is said to have targeted voters to drive them away from Clinton.

'They ultimately added something and I think again we'd better understand that. The Mercers did not invest all that money for their own amusement,' she told the Codecon convention.

The massive demonstrations in Washington and other cities in the wake of the election were organized as an immediate response to Clinton's shock defeat.

But that did not stop Clinton from writing in What Happened: 'I couldn't help but ask where those feelings of solidarity, outrage and passion had been during the election.'

The NBC Today show anchor quizzed both candidates at a 'commander-in-chief forum' on board Intrepid in New York.

But Clinton - who went first in the back-to-back interviews, complained about Lauer focusing on her secret server and whether it raised questions over her trustworthiness.

'Lauer had turned what should have been a serious discussion into a pointless ambush. What a waste of time,' she writes in What Happened. She later delighted in his firing for sexual misconduct, saying in December: 'Every day I believe more in karma.'

'White voters have been fleeing the Democratic party ever since Lyndon Johnson predicted they would,' she told Vox.

'We're not making the documentaries that we're going to get onto Netflix,' she told Codecon.

She was asked by the interviewer: 'This is because Hollywood isn't liberal enough?'

'No, it's because Democrats aren't putting their money there,' she replied.

The attacks on the U.S. diplomatic compound in the Libyan city of Benghazi on September 11, 2012, happened when Clinton was Secretary of State. It claimed four American lives, and was the focus of intense investigation by Congress.

Clinton told the Today show: 'Take the Benghazi tragedy - you know, I have one of the top Republicans, Kevin McCarthy, admitting we're going to take that tragedy - because, you know, we've lost people, unfortunately, going back to the Reagan administration, if you talk about recent times, in diplomatic attacks.

'But boy, it was turned into a political football. And it was aimed at undermining my credibility, my record, my accomplishments.'

Suppressing her voters was named by Clinton as one of the major factors in her defeat in her interview on the Today show when she rattled off her laundry list. 'What was at work here?' she said.

'In addition to the mistakes that I made, which I recount in the book, what about endemic sexism and misogyny, not just in politics but in our society, what about the unprecedented action of the FBI director, what about the interference of an adversary nation, what about voter suppression?'

It was a return to a theme - she suggested it was a problem in Wisconsin in an interview in May with New York magazine.

'I would have won had I not been subjected to the unprecedented attacks by Comey and the Russians, aided and abetted by the suppression of the vote, particularly in Wisconsin,' she said.

'Republicans learned that if you suppress votes you win.'

The Senate majority leader is accused of stopping the Obama administration from revealing what Clinton says the Russians were up to, helping tip the balance against her because he did not want a third successive Democratic term in the White House.

'Mitch McConnell, in what I think of as a not only unpatriotic but despicable act of partisan politics, made it clear that if the Obama Administration spoke publicly about what they knew [on Russia], he would accuse them of partisan politics, of trying to tip the balance toward me,' she told the New Yorker.

Clinton claims the Supreme Court watered down the Voting Rights Act at the Codecon convention.

'You had effective suppression of votes,' she said.

'I was in the senate when we voted 98-0 under a Republican president, George W Bush, to extend the Voting Rights Act and the Supreme Court says 'oh we don't need it any more' , throws it out, and Republican governors and legislatures began doing everything they could to suppress the votes.'

Clinton appears to be referring to Second 4(b) of the Act being ruled unconstitutional by the court in 2013, because it relied on out of date data which meant it was not in line with the 15th Amendment.

Clinton says that James Comey's actions in re-opening the FBI investigation allowed men to influence their wives or girlfriends.

'Women will have no empathy for you because they will be under tremendous pressure - and I'm talking principally about white women - they will be under tremendous pressure from fathers, and husbands, and boyfriends and male employers, not to vote for 'the girl',' she told NPR.

Named by her confidante Lanny Davis as the reason she lost at a reading of his book while Hillary nodded along in approval.

The claim that members of the Democratic party and particularly the Clinton campaign were running a pedophile child trafficking ring out of the basement of a Washington D.C. pizza restaurant first surfaced before the 2016 election. She told an address to a women-only club in New York in April 2018: 'It spread like wildfire. You look and that and think, that's ridiculous. But you have no idea how many people will believe things that are presented as news.'

1314,"This essay examines reactionary, countersubversive fictions produced in the context of two conspiracy theories in the United States: the Illuminati crisis (1798–1800) and Pizzagate (2016–17). The author suggests that both cases emblematize a pornotropic aesthetic, a racialized sadomasochism that recurs across United States culture. Building on the work of Hortense Spillers, Alexander Weheliye, Jennifer Christine Nash, and others, this essay argues that observers should understand countersubversive political reaction as an aesthetic project, a pornotropic fantasy that distorts underlying conditions of racial subjection. In the context of a resurgent far right that describes its enemies as “cuckolds” and frequently deploys the tropes of highly racialized pornography, this essay suggests that we might find the deep origins of pornographic, reactionary paranoia in the eighteenth century. It suggests, moreover, that understanding and contesting the underlying conditions of racial subjection require that scholars consider the power of pornotropic, countersubversive aesthetics to bring pleasure, to move people, and to order the world.",mainstream,M0d6e6,pizzagate
467,"Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his scheduled appearance at a major upcoming tech industry trade show after receiving death threats, two agency sources told Recode on Thursday.

It's the second known incident in which Pai's safety may have been at risk, after a bomb threat abruptly forced the chairman to halt his controversial vote to scrap the U.S. government's net neutrality rules in December 2017.

For both Pai and the whole of the FCC, the uptick in security concerns also presents a serious challenge to their ability to discuss critical tech policy issues in public view — without jeopardizing their safety or the safety of others in attendance.
• Another big Amazon acquisition, a Peloton IPO — and other commerce predictions for 2018
• It ain't over: Net neutrality advocates are preparing a massive new war against Trump's FCC
• Mark Zuckerberg's personal challenge this year is to fix Facebook

In this case, the exact nature of the threat, made in advance of Pai's fireside chat at the 2018 International CES, isn't clear. A spokesman for Pai at the FCC, for its part, only said Thursday: ""We do not comment on security measures or concerns.""

But sources at the agency said that federal law enforcement had intervened in the matter, and other FCC offices are expected to be briefed on the matter. The FBI did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

A spokeswoman for the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on the annual Las Vegas-based trade show, also declined to comment. Earlier, though, CTA's leader, Gary Shapiro, told the publication Digital Trends that he did not know why Pai had canceled — but raised the fact that he had recently been ""subject to vicious and direct attacks and threats.""

For months, Pai has been hounded by his critics, particularly online, who view his vote to repeal net neutrality rules as tantamount to destroying the internet. Pai has lamented in speeches and tweets that he and his family have been mocked, attacked and threatened, in public as well as on Twitter, where Pai himself is active.

By the nature of the job, the chairmanship of the FCC is an especially public role, and threats to its leaders and commissioners aren't exactly new. In 2014, for example, protesters descended on the home of then-Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, and prevented him from leaving his driveway. Then, too, net neutrality had been the issue at hand.

In the most recent debate, though, tensions have been especially high, driven in no small part by broader frustrations among the public with the Trump administration writ large. If the death threats continue, it is unclear how Pai and his fellow commissioners will proceed.

For now, Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and Republican Commissioners Michael O'Rielly and Brendan Carr each plan to attend CES. So will Maureen Ohlhausen, the acting leader of their sister agency, the Federal Trade Commission. Ohlhausen had been slated to appear alongside Pai at the annual Vegas event.

900,"THEORISTS are adamant the apocalypse is a matter of HOURS away.

If Blue Monday wasn’t worrying enough, some conspiracy theorists believe that the end of the world will be triggered by Friday the 13th bad luck and two extra-terrestrial events.

Last night, Venus could be seen the brightest it’s been for eight years as a Wolf Moon lingered in the sky.

The combination of these celestial phenomenon and the fact that Friday the 13th is today has been enough to send believers into a panic.

Some religious theorists have cited a passage from the Bible to cement their claims.

Luke 21:25 reads: “And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring.”

This excerpt is loosely backed up by some of the natural occurrences that have taken place over the last two days.

The tides have been affected by the Wolf Moon and the second planet from the sun has been shining brighter than normal, causing the waves to “roar” and “signs in the sun”.

Concerned conspiracists took to Facebook to warn their friends about the impending doom.

One said: “Please we need to be ready at all times because we are practically close to the end of days.”

Another agreed: “Jesus is going to crack the sky and take His children home soon and very soon. The world is looking for a savior in all the wrong places.

“So much division and hatred, and wars of every kind. Not just wars between countries, but wars in the home, wars with the government, wars between generations, wars in the marriage, wars in the streets, war everywhere you see.”

Others believe that Donald Trump’s imminent inauguration will also have something to do with the apocalypse.

According to conspiracy theorists, Donald Trump‘s surprise election victory has coincided with people hearing a terrifying trumpet sound around the earth.

And there are fears that the ‘Trump Trumpet’ may be heralding the end of the world, after it was linked to a Biblical claim about the the “First Four Trumpets of Revelation” signifying the apocalypse.",mainstream,M0ecf0,pizzagate
581,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, last year signed a $7,000-a-month contract with the foundation of a major Clinton donor who made a fortune selling a type of mortgage that some critics say contributed to the housing collapse, hacked emails show.

In February of last year, as Podesta was working to lay the groundwork for Clinton’s soon-to-launch campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, he signed the contract with the Sandler Foundation, which was started by Herb Sandler and his late wife Marion Sandler.

The contract — a copy of which was included in emails illegally obtained from Podesta’s Gmail account and disseminated Monday by WikiLeaks — is still active, according to Herb Sandler, who said that it calls for Podesta to provide advice on grant-making and other foundation functions.

It’s unusual for the full-time chairman of a general-election presidential campaign to maintain an active side deal with a major donor to that campaign — let alone to raise money from that donor for the campaign.

But the hacked emails show that Podesta, who does not draw a salary from the Clinton campaign (though he has been paid $58,000 by the campaign for travel and “subsistence”), did both, while also maintaining a close personal relationship with Sandler.

The WikiLeaks cache shows that Podesta provided Sandler with philanthropic advice and assortments of cheeses and pastas as gifts on the holidays, while Sandler offered all manner of political observations and once tried to get Podesta to arrange for former President Bill Clinton to write a blurb for a book written by one of Sandler’s friends.

But Sandler brushed aside any concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

“I have never asked for anything of any political person — zero requests ever,” Sandler said. “If they’re responsive, it’s because they regard me as thoughtful, and a major contributor to Democratic causes,” Sandler said, adding that Podesta “knows that he doesn’t get bullshit from me. He knows I have no hidden agenda. He knows that my values are similar to his and that we care about people and not the billionaires, even though I ended up by some crazy thing to be one.”

Neither Podesta nor the Clinton campaign responded to questions about the contract.

The Clinton campaign instead issued a statement saying it’s “not commenting on the authenticity of any individual emails,” and accusing the Russian government of engineering the hack. Further, Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin urged the FBI “to clearly tell the American people” whether it’s investigating suggestions that associates of Clinton’s Republican rival, Donald Trump, had advance knowledge of the cyberattacks.

Sandler and his children this cycle also have donated nearly $4.4 million to Clinton’s presidential campaign, a supportive super PAC called Priorities USA Action and various Democratic Party committees, according to Federal Election Commission filings.

Herb Sandler’s Clinton-related giving picked up last December after a visit from Podesta.

Sandler is “ready to do the 2016 max early in the new year,” Podesta emailed the campaign’s finance team the day after visiting with Sandler in his hometown of San Francisco during a West Coast swing. “Whoever has been dealing with him should call him at the office on the Jan 4 to follow up,” Podesta wrote, adding that Sandler “is also prepared to double down on his Priorities support as well.”

The very next day, Sandler gave $1.5 million to Priorities USA Action, to which he has now given a total of $3 million, FEC records show.

While it’s illegal for super PACs and campaigns to coordinate their spending strategies, they are permitted to coordinate their fundraising within limits, and Podesta’s efforts with Sandler appear to be within those bounds.

The Sandler Foundation also is barred from supporting campaigns, and there is no evidence that it has done so with the Clinton campaign.

During the GOP primary, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign chairman Mike Grebe drew scrutiny for his day job as head of a major foundation, despite working assiduously to separate his two roles. Nonetheless, the foundation funded conservative groups that were seen as laying the intellectual groundwork for Walker’s campaign.

The Sandlers’ big giving well predates Clinton’s current campaign.

The family’s fortune comes from the savings and loan institution that Herb and Marion Sandler ran for decades, a bank that became World Savings. It would end up making boatloads of cash from a type of adjustable rate mortgage that other lenders would later adopt, securitize and sell in a way that some have blamed for contributing to the housing bubble that burst in 2008. Not long before the burst and subsequent recession, the Sandlers sold the bank for $25.5 billion to Wachovia, earning $2.6 billion off the sale and donating most of their net worth to their foundation. Wachovia was later acquired by Wells Fargo.

The Sandlers met Podesta when they helped seed the Center for American Progress, the think tank he started in 2003 as a sort of Democratic administration in exile during George W. Bush’s presidency. Tax filings show that the Sandler Foundation has donated more than $37 million over the years to CAP, which worked to support President Barack Obama’s administration but has always been seen as more aligned with Hillary Clinton.

The WikiLeaks emails reveal that Podesta and his team at the Center for American Progress discussed how to push back on scrutiny of the Sandlers related to the 2008 housing collapse. That included an October 2008 ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch in which an actor playing Herb Sandler thanked members of Congress “for helping block congressional oversight of our corrupt activity.”

Podesta wrote to his colleagues that he’d talked to Herb Sandler, and “they are obviosly [sic] upset. Weird that snl should pick them out.”

After doing some research, a subordinate replied that “it appears default rates on their stuff was high (herb says not more so than others) and the losses were key to almsot [sic] wachovia failure -- athough [sic] herb emphasizes that they were only one of the institutions [sic] problems.”

Another staffer indicated plans to enlist then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the pushback. It’s unclear whether that happened or whether Podesta or CAP reached out to ""SNL."" But the editor in chief of the Sandler-funded journalism outfit ProPublica did, arguing that the Sandlers were unfairly vilified, according to a New York Times piece soon after the skit.

The show’s producer, Lorne Michaels, apologized for the skit.

Sandler told POLITICO that any suggestion that his bank’s products contributed to the collapse were “a bunch of bullshit,” pointing out that their bank used a risk-averse approach to their loans, which had among the lowest default rates in the industry.

But Scott Walter, president of Capital Research Center, a conservative nonprofit that monitors the giving of major liberal donors including Sandler, argued that Podesta’s newly revealed contractual relationship with Sandler stood in stark contrast to Clinton’s efforts to cast herself as tough on the financial industry.

“This is another instance where the Clinton campaign has been revealed to have surprising links to some of the most dubious parts of the finance industry,” Walter said.

The Sandlers’ philanthropy increasingly has focused on fighting financial inequality and the role of big money in politics — a subject about which Herb Sandler and Podesta emailed frequently, according to WikiLeaks.

In forwarding Podesta a 2014 study about rising inequality and the influence of money in politics with the headline “U.S. No Longer An Actual Democracy,” Sandler wrote: “This is precisely what Marion and I have believed for some time… It is horrible.”

The WikiLeaks emails reveal Sandler and Podesta working closely on the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a research institution that was launched at CAP in 2013 and now operates independently.

One of the emails revealed that Sandler had agreed to donate $3 million a year for at least the first three years to the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, which focuses on policies to more evenly distribute the benefits of growth.

Sandler explained to POLITICO that during the process of working to launch the center, he realized “we had been picking his brain ad nauseum” for years without paying Podesta as a consultant — a scenario Sandler called “very unfair.” That led to the consulting contract, which Sandler cast as “a ripoff” for Podesta. “I’d pay a lot more for that advice,” Sandler said, calling Podesta “one the most intelligent, decent, thoughtful human beings I’d ever met.”

In March, as Clinton’s Democratic primary campaign against Bernie Sanders grew increasingly bitter, Sandler emailed Podesta just to check in.

Podesta responded: “I was going to call you last night but fell asleep … I'll call later.”",mainstream,M1c3ee,pizzagate
977,"A North Carolina man at the center of the so-called 'pizzagate' incident in which he stormed into a Washington DC pizzeria and fired an assault rifle as he tried to 'self-investigate' an internet conspiracy theory now faces a federal weapons charge.

Prosecutors announced on Tuesday that Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, is charged with interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit a crime, while local charges including assault with a dangerous weapon and property destruction have been dropped.

The federal count carries a statutory maximum of 10 years in prison and potential financial penalties.

Welch appeared briefly in Superior Court in the District of Columbia on Tuesday.

Assistant US Attorney Sonali Patel told a judge that prosecutors are dismissing the local charges because they have obtained a federal arrest warrant.

The 28-year-old suspect has been in jail since the December 4 shooting at Comet Ping Pong, which was targeted by purveyors of fake news and falsely rumored to be the site of a child sex trafficking ring with ties to Hillary Clinton.

Welch, of Salisbury, North Carolina, told police 'he had read online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there,' and that 'he was armed to help rescue them,' according to previously released court documents.

A federal court document made public Tuesday says evidence obtained from Welch's cellphone shows he 'had been contemplating a violent confrontation at the restaurant since at least' December 1.

The document details a series of text messages Welch exchanged with two unnamed friends.

He asked one friend if his Army buddy might be 'down for the cause?' which he described as 'Raiding a pedo ring, possibly sacraficing (sic) the lives of a few for the lives of many,' and standing up against 'a corrupt system that kidnaps, tortures and rapes babies and children in our own backyard.'

The document suggests the three friends met, but doesn't say anything about them joining Welch for his trip to Washington. One friend texted encouragement as Welch drove.

The document also says Welch recorded a video on his phone on the day of the shooting, telling his family members that he loved them and expressing hopes that he would be able to tell them that again.

'And if not,' he said, 'don't ever forget it.'

Welch walked into the Comet Ping Pong restaurant carrying a .38 revolver in a holster on his hip and the AR-15 assault weapon across his chest 'in a manner that instilled fear in everyone who saw him,' the document said.

Customers and employees fled, and when one worker unwittingly walked in through a rear door, Welch pointed his weapon at that employee, who also fled, the document says.

The federal document says Welch said he fired at a locked door as he 'searched for evidence of hidden rooms or tunnels or child sex-trafficking of any kind. An earlier document, supporting the now-dismissed local charges, said Welch fired repeatedly, striking the walls, one door and a desktop computer.

Welch 'surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant,' court documents have said. No one was hurt.

His parents, Terri Welch and Harry Welch Jr., were in court on Tuesday, but declined to speak to an Associated Press reporter.

They did speak with The Washington Post at their son's public defender's office on Monday, saying he shifted from energetic and outgoing to melancholy and quiet after he hit a 13-year-old pedestrian with his car in October. He began having nightmares, but did not to seek help, they said.

No charges were filed in the crash, but Harry Welch said his son felt guilty and worried about the long-term impact on the child, who had to be airlifted to a hospital with broken bones and a head injury.

'He was very traumatized. We feel that accident changed him,' Harry Welch said, and his wife said they have wondered whether it could have been a catalyst for the gun violence.

The couple had not spoken with their son since the shooting but described him as loving and responsible, an affectionate father to two young girls, an aspiring EMT, and so religious that he has two Bible verses, Isaiah 40:30-31, tattooed across his back.

After Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake, he spent weeks there building houses with a church.

The Parliament’s helpless. Good thing they’re on vacation then, I reckon

Two PDF files will come to define the state of the West’s political landscape, circa 2018: the US Department of Justice’s indictment of twelve Russian intelligence agents for hacking the 2016 presidential election; and the British House of Commons’ interim report on disinformation and fake news, published this week. Whether their effect will be comparable at all is hard to tell.

They are two very different documents, for tone, scope, and language. What connects them is their subject matter: how technology has been weaponised — by foreign powers, culture warriors, reckless mercenaries, and careless technologists — to disrupt elections in multiple countries. The DOJ’s document is a fast-paced spy story, where spooks shoot about cryptocurrency to rent servers, steal the Clinton campaign’s emails, and turn them over to Wikileaks – a digital transparency champion hijacked to do the bidding of shadowy agents.

The British report reads, fittingly, more like a Lewis Carroll’s tale: the 12-people parliamentary committee on Digital, Culture, Media & Sport have stepped into a rabbit hole, and now they cannot help meeting with an ensemble cast of friends, foes and helpers, burrowing deeper and deeper with each encounter. In perfect Carrollian fashion, it all started with a question of semantics: “what does ‘fake news’ mean?”

When the DCMS committee launched its inquiry in early 2017, that was a question worth asking.

344,"Belgium’s sentencing court ordered a new psychiatric report on Marc Dutroux, a convicted child rapist and killer, in order to determine whether he should be released early from prison, which could become a reality in 2021. Experts will determine whether Dutroux is likely to re-offend, and will examine the impact of his detention in solitary confinement over the past 23 years. He was convicted of raping five girls in 1989 and spent three years in prison. He was later convicted of abducting and raping six more girls in 1995-1996. Four of the kidnapped girls died horrific deaths while in his custody. In 1996, as many as 400,000 outraged citizens filled the street to protest against the mishandling of the case by law enforcement and the judiciary, revealing widespread distrust in the country’s institutions that threatened the establishment. Dutroux contends that he is part of a criminal network that includes high-level pedophiles.

Marc Dutroux has been imprisoned since 1996 for kidnapping, child rape and murder.

Outrage over incompetence by law enforcement led to as many as 400,000 people marching in the streets against government corruption in 1996. Workers across the country went on strike. Many believe that police incompetence and cover-ups were used to protect high-level pedophiles. Records show that at least 20 witnesses and others connected to the crimes have died under very suspicious circumstances.

In 1989, Dutroux and his wife, Michelle Martin, were convicted of raping five girls. Dutroux was sentenced to 13 years in prison, but was released after serving only 3 years.



In June of 1995, two 8-year old girls, Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo, were kidnapped and held in the dungeon that Dutroux had constructed. Dutroux raped both girls repeatedly and made pornographic videos of the abuse.



In August of 1995, two months after the 8-year old girls were abducted, two young women, An Marchal, 17, and Eefje Lambrecks, 19, were abducted while leaving a night club during their holiday. Marchal’s father said police initially refused to search for the young ladies.

Dutroux admitted to killing his associate, Bernard Weinstein, who was drugged, tortured and buried alive in 1995.



In December of 1995, Dutroux was arrested over a stolen truck, and, while he served a 4-month prison sentence, his 8-year old captives died miserable deaths due to thirst and starvation. His wife reportedly said that she was too scared to go to the cellar and take care of the young girls. The older teens, An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, were later discovered to have been drugged and buried alive.

In 1996, Sabine Dardenne, 12, was abducted while riding her bike to school. She was chained to a bed by a collar around her neck and repeatedly raped. Months later, Laetitia Delhez, 14, was abducted snatched off the street while walking home from swimming. Both girls were rescued.

Dutroux confessed to holding and raping all six girls.

Dutroux was diagnosed as a psychopath. He is the father of five children, three of them with his second wife and accomplice, Michelle Martin. He was an unemployed electrician who received welfare benefits, yet he owned seven houses. He built several dungeons in the cellars of the homes where he kept the abducted girls.

According to reports, police could have arrested Marc Dutroux long before they did, as he was named as a suspect in the young missing girls’ files, but police failed to act, and four girls died. The police are also accused of bungling an investigation in 1995, when they put him under surveillance, but the police camera was turned off at night, between 6 pm and 8 am, and Dutroux kidnapped the older pair of girls at night. In addition, during a police search of one of Dutroux’s properties, a locksmith reported that he heard children’s voices, but he was ignored by the police officer.

On Sunday, 20 October, 400 Belgians met in the streets of Brussels on what they called the Black March – to protest against the potential early release from prison of paedophile and child killer Marc Dutroux.

Today, Monday, 28 October, Belgium’s sentencing court ordered a new psychiatric report on Dutroux that could see this become a reality in 2021.

A news source that reaches 700 million around the world, breaks down these conflicts around the world from inside Syria to the that was totally unexpected, because most of Meanwhile: Americans are just beginning to understand how critical it is that we all begin to track all the crimes related to the just completed 'selection', as that knowledge begins to be translated into serious prosecutions throughout the government and across this land. Chapter 5, The Art of War by Sun Tzu  Making the armies take on opponents without being defeated is a matter of unorthodox and orthodox methods. In battle, confrontation is done, directly. Victory is gained by surprise. Therefore those skilled at the unorthodox are infinite as heaven and earth, inexhaustible as the great rivers. When they come to an end they begin again like the days and months; they die and are reborn like the four seasons. There are only two kinds of charge in battle the unorthodox surprise attack and the orthodox direct attack, but variations of the unorthodox and the orthodox are endless. The unorthodox and the orthodox give rise to each other, At the moment the world is besieged by global-outlaws that seek nothing less than the total destruction of humanity, by any and all means necessary. They began the current fight, in the exact same way they began all the previous wars throughout recorded history, with a series of False-Flag attacks to 'justify' each new war in their pathetic global plan for global conquest. What the public is just now beginning to see is that our truly unorthodox warriors have forced these global-enemies to drop their preferred method of attack - because as everyone now knows their ownership of the global-media has led them to believe they can lie about everything without fear of ever being caught: Yet that's exactly what's happened to their supposed dominance of their Main-Stream-Media, that's been very forcefully damaged by huge numbers of awakening people the world over. The consequence of this very public death of 'False-Flag Events' has forced the enemy to fall back on what they're claiming is just Fake-News - forgetting that we already know that FAKE-NEWS has always been one of their preferred deceptions, which they have always 'owned', but until now ­ they've never had to rely upon, because we have now successfully murdered their beloved False-Flags, that were oh so convenient before we outed them. The awakening public around the world has done this, along with the growing number of rebels, so that instead of remaining intimidated by the Fake World Order (FWO) ­ we're all beginning to move on into their deeper darker-plans that we are now threatening to expose: With renewed unorthodox plans of our own, while the enemy is still spinning from their most recent defeat in their prescripted American selection of 2016 - which they collectively managed to lose. Consequently a whole new plan is already taking root, so that as Sun Tzu infers ­ 'the unorthodox method can sometimes totally reverse momentum'. 

 The third part of this WAR which consists of when we will finally start arresting people, for the very massive and very real crimes that have been going on for over three decades which has yet to be addressed. The Clinton Foundation is a massive criminal enterprise and has been from the beginning.

The criminal behavior of most of the members of the criminal government and the courts-system, the entire Department of Just-Us which has yet to be investigated, are also a huge part of all of this.

582,"In their panic to save the mainstream narrative, that all is well in their fantasy world, CNN broadcasted a documentary on ritual cannibalism to contain Wikileaks’ anti-CIA nuclear bomb called Vault7. 

 How a mainstream broadcast entity could have gone so low as to tackle a subject that has no relevance to the issues of the day and age is beyond comprehension.

 

 Are they now trying to add more to the “Muslims are terrorists” hate-inspiring narrative, with another equally divisive “Hindus are man eaters,” too?

 This racist tactic may have worked a century ago, but current realities are only showing how stupid the whole exercise really is.

 As expected, all they got in return is worldwide condemnation, and a new name, i.e. Cannibal News Network.

 Sounds just about right.



 For decades, the CNN and allied Rothschild media networks, have been cannibalizing the brains of the Western population and that of the rest of the world, with half-truths and blatant fabrication of narratives.

 

 These propaganda outfits have enjoyed the “presumption of regularity” in all their activities, i.e. where people assumes anything that is aired through their elaborately decorated studios to be true. Otherwise, the story must be “fake news.”

 The glaring divide among the US electorate is one sad example of the grave effects of a deliberate and systematic dumbing down of the Americans. Some are even willing to fight it out in favor of a candidate who has been living in at least two different realities.

To put it bluntly, the entire Deep State is now in an uncomfortable deep shit that’s been spread around their faces.

 But everything they have said all this time is now being exposed as one big lie.

 For the CNN to project that cannibalism is Hinduism would cost them more than just their own reputation, if they still have it.

 The less than a 100-strong Aghori tribe does not represent Hinduism, and is in fact being frowned upon by the latter. A billion-strong Hindus are now moving to boycott CNN for good.



 Work all your life for a headline like this?

 It seems that CNN’s Reza Aslan is also a victim of their own cannibalistic enterprise. He could not decipher anymore, which material could add more to the enlightenment of the masses from feeding the appetite of the beasts.

 

 We are told to give the guy a break, as he was through scouring the CNN headquarter for brains, but there was none. Seriously though, we think that there’s something more to the stagecraft, as always.

 While journalist, part-time cannibal, Aslan may be doing his own brand of journalism, the Cannibal News Network itself has a more elaborate agenda.

 We suspect that aside from diverting the world’s attention from the fallout of Wikileaks’ Vault7 revelations, and sowing divisiveness among Immigrant America, the Deep State conglomerate is also trying to normalize Satanic rituals that’s been implicating the highest ranking public officials of the West, i.e. PedoGate and PizzaGate scandals, in the last few months.

According to our DHS Insider,

 “There is a concerted attack on Sessions due to his zeroing in on the pedophilia scandal called Pedogate. John McCain and Lindsay Graham are secretly working with Chuck Schumer and members of the clandestine services of both US and Israel to remove Sessions, or at least stop the Pedophilia investigation in its tracks.” 

 As you probably know, what is now becoming known as “Pedogate” represents not only hundreds of millions of dollars in hush money, but also untold political influence-peddling.

 Rince Pribus is also a key player in covering up the scandal, as is Adam Schiff, Nancy Pelosi, John Podesta, Hillary and Bill Clinton, and of course Barack Obama.

 When Netanyahu met with Trump, Netanyahu attempted to convince Trump the pedophilia scandal was “a false premise”. Netanyahu is also scared of exposure. Trump became suspicious and has become increasingly aware of how big the pedophile scandal is.

 Trump has told several in his inner circle that [quoted by our insider] “the swamp is much more polluted than I expected“. He has spoken to Chris Christie extensively about the Pedophilia ring(s) and it has been determined that branches of the ring spread as far as Asia, and are rooted in the deepest corners of both the US and the UK political system.

 Trump was overheard telling his daughter [quoted by our source] “This town is pedophile central…” and “This makes me sick“.

Cannibalism is at the center of Luciferian rituals.

 Basically, pedophiles are running the Western world according to a few courageous Western investigative journalists themselves.

 Are they now moving in for the kill, that all religions are bad, except Catholicism, so that they could finally establish the One World Religion?

 If that’s the case, then Pope Bergoglio’s recent statement that he’s now contemplating of allowing married men to join the Pedophile, Inc. should come as no surprise.

https://youtu.be/dcpVrtv2t-M

 As far as we could discern it, modern day religions are not just confined to the organized church, but also in many divisive “movements” that they’ve sponsored.

 We could not spot any difference in the LGBT movement, or the climate change pseudo-environmentalists club anymore, etc., when compared to the old religions anymore. They all seem to serve the same purpose.

 Indeed, they are.

 Geopolitically, a kinetic quarrel between Muslim Iran and Hindu India could be useful now to weaken the BRICS Alliance, and sabotage the Eurasian “One Belt One Road” project of China. CNN’s Reza Aslan is identified as an Iranian-born religious scholar.

 When will they finally wake up to the reality that they’ve lost the war?

1134,"Twitter says British Columbia isn't the proper place for a West Vancouver billionaire to sue the social media giant over ""defamatory and malicious"" tweets that he claims were posted to discredit him because of his work with Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Frank Giustra filed a lawsuit against Twitter in B.C. Supreme Court in April seeking an order to force the company to remove tweets he claimed painted him as ""corrupt"" and ""criminal"".

He said the online attacks included death threats and links to ""pizzagate"" — ""a false, discredited and malicious conspiracy theory in which [Giustra] was labeled a 'pedophile.'""

In response, Twitter has now filed an application to have the lawsuit dismissed or stayed, arguing that if Giustra's claim were to be heard anywhere, it should be in California, where the company is headquartered.

The case provides a window into both the challenges of attempting to hold social media companies accountable for the material on their services and the ongoing debate over jurisdiction when it comes to the internet.

The issue has gone all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada in recent years, where the court upheld a B.C. court's decision to issue a worldwide injunction ordering Google to remove a Vancouver company's name from its global search results.

""The problem in this case is occurring online and globally,"" Canada's highest court noted.

""The internet has no borders — its natural habitat is global. The only way to ensure that the interlocutory injunction attained its objective was to have it apply where Google operates — globally.""

'I do not want to cancel my Twitter account'

The new court filings include a letter Giustra wrote to Twitter chief executive officer Jack Dorsey in April 2018, asking him to make his case a priority.

""As Twitter's CEO, I ask that you now investigate the source of these past and ongoing attacks against me — whether they are the result of individuals, a group, bots, or a combination of all three,"" Giustra wrote.

""I do not want to cancel my Twitter account — that would be a victory of those who are turning this incredible communication tool into a conduit for slander and hate.""

Giustra is CEO of the Fiore Group of companies and founder of Lionsgate Entertainment. He's also a well known philanthropist who has been awarded the Order of B.C. for his activities.

In his lawsuit, Giustra claimed he was targeted by a group who vilified him ""for political purposes in relation to the 2016 United States election"" and his work in support of the Clinton Foundation.

In response, Twitter director of trust and safety John Starr claimed in an affidavit that the New York Times and other news sources published articles linking Giustra to the Clintons.

""Consequently, Twitter users posted opinions on the Twitter platform concerning their views ... which led to tweets about [Giustra], his involvement with the Clintons, the Clinton Foundation, and his business interests,"" Starr wrote.

Starr said all the tweets about ""pizzagate"" were removed from Twitter following Giustra's complaint.

He says there were 98 tweets in question, which came from 67 distinct Twitter accounts. Of those, 10 were set up in Canada and only one was set up in B.C.

By contrast, Starr claims that 42 of the accounts were based in the U.S.

""As of today, nearly all the subject tweets have been removed and are unable to be read, downloaded or otherwise accessed from the Twitter platform in Canada,"" Starr wrote.

""Some of the tweets that are not available in Canada are, however, available on the Twitter platform in the United States.""

Twitter's application to dismiss Giustra's claim will be heard later this month.

Twitter argues that the company is based in California and has no employees or assets in B.C. or Canada.

The company says it would have to call current and former employees to testify if the case goes ahead, and since most of its workforce resides in California, Twitter claims it would face higher costs and undue burdens.

904,"A struggling model and actor has been arrested for setting fire to the pizza parlor that became infamous due to a false conspiracy theory that came to be known as Pizzagate.

Ryan Jaselskis, 22, is facing federal arson charges after being identified as the man caught on surveillance video at Comet Pizza on January 23, the same night that an individual intentionally set fire to the Virginia eatery.

He was identified by a firefighter who recognized Jaselskis' blue jacket from the surveillance video while treating him on February 4 following a bizarre incident at the Washington Monument.

On January 23, Jaselskis set fire to some curtains at the pizza parlor before fleeing, with footage showing his attempt to destroy at least one camera on his way out the door.

Jaselkis found himself in need of medical attention after he was tasered by an officer with the U.S. Park Police while attempting to break into the national landmark according to court documents.

He was charged with unlawful entry and assaulting a police officer at that time and released from jail the next day.

That incident was captured by Cam Hasbrouck, who later uploaded the video to social media.

Jaselskis then returned to the Washington Monument hours after his release and again attempted to break in, only to be thwarted once again by US Park Police.

There was no resistance from Jaselkis during his second run-in with authorities, and he was later charged with unlawful entry, destruction of public property, and contempt in Superior Court.

It was not until Tuesday though that Jaselskis was officially declared a suspect by agents with the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms agents.

He was booked after a customer who was at Pizza Comet on the night of the fire picked Jaselskis out of a line-up.

Jaselskis is now facing up to 20 years in prison on the charge of federal arson, and is being held without bond until a hearing next week.

This is not the first incident to occur at Comet Pizza in the wake of fake news reports claiming that is was a front for a child smuggling ring.

In 2016, a man invaded the pizzeria with an assault rifle.

He was later was given a four-year prison sentence.

Welch, 28, stormed into Comet Ping Pong, an upscale pizza house, with an AR-15 assault rifle after becoming outraged by right-wing talk on social media that it was central to a pedophile network with deep connections to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

No one was hurt, but police had to lock down the neighborhood before Welch surrendered.

The incident followed President Donald Trump's victory over Clinton in a heated contest that was fueled at times by fake news circulating on social media.

Welch, who drove from North Carolina to Washington to 'investigate' Comet himself, was seen by some as much a victim for having believed reports on websites such as Reddit and Infowars that the restaurant hid a politically connected pedophile ring.",mainstream,M180d9,pizzagate
346,"The bombshell claim that ABC News ""quashed"" a story on allegations against Jeffrey Epstein has drawn new scrutiny on the controversy's ties to its own star anchor, George Stephanopoulos.

Project Veritas, whose controversial founder, James O'Keefe, has described himself as a ""guerrilla journalist,"" published the footage that featured ABC News anchor Amy Robach claiming the Disney-owned network refused to air an interview she conducted with one of Epstein’s accusers and even suggesting she'd uncovered new information about Epstein's ties to former President Bill Clinton as his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was running for president.

""I've had the story for three years... we would not put it on the air,"" Robach said on the hot mic. ""It was unbelievable what we had, Clinton, we had everything.""

Stephanopoulos, ABC News' chief anchor on ""Good Morning America"" and the Sunday program ""This Week"" who's overseen the network's political coverage, has had deep ties to the Clintons. Before he became the face of ABC News, he made a name for himself as a senior adviser to President Clinton back in the '90s. Ahead of the 2016 election, he pulled out of moderating debates after his $75,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation drew criticism.

However, what's really raising eyebrows is a 2010 report of a party Stephanopoulos attended that Epstein had hosted.

Page Six reported that the convicted pedophile held an event in honor of Prince Andrew, who was one of the high-profile figures implicated in the scandal, in his New York City townhouse, and on the guestlist were several members of the media, including Stephanopoulos.

The party took place after Epstein's 13-month prison stint for soliciting prostitutes under 18.

Despite having made multiple trips overseas with Epstein, President Clinton denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's alleged sexual predation. Strangely, though, it was reported that Epstein had a painting of Clinton depicted in the Oval Office wearing a blue dress and red high heels.

Stephanopoulos is known to be highly influential inside ABC News, but a spokesperson told Fox News he had ""no involvement"" in Robach's interview.

In an earlier statement, ABC News denied it tried to stop Robach's story, claiming her reporting at the time did not ""meet our standards to air.""

""At the time, not all of our reporting met our standards to air, but we have never stopped investigating the story. Ever since, we’ve had a team on this investigation and substantial resources dedicated to it,"" an ABC News spokesperson told Fox News.

585,"Tech companies and government leaders have been struggling to solve the problem of fake news, with Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, earlier promising to work on technology tools to slow the gusher of false digital information. In a news briefing on Monday, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said free speech rights pose a challenge for media platforms to prevent misinformation from leading to episodes like the gunman at Comet Ping Pong.

“Many of the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley didn’t develop this technology to make it easier for hate to be propagated online; their idea was to build a community where people could more effectively communicate and engage in commerce,” Mr. Earnest said. “If you do administer a platform that is used extensively to propagate hate and to inspire acts of violence, well, I think most people are going to be less likely to use the platform.”

For purveyors of fake news who have continued pushing the Pizzagate theory even after the facts have been debunked, whether Comet Ping Pong is even engaged in a pedophilia ring is beyond the point. Jeffrey Marty, a lawyer from Florida, said in a phone interview that he was the man posing as Representative Steven Smith from Georgia’s fictional 15th District. He said that he was frustrated with the way the mainstream media covered the election and that he believes that most of his 24,000 followers know that his account is a parody.

Mr. Marty, who has tweeted links to fake news stories and repeatedly said the mainstream media needs to investigate Pizzagate, declined to say whether he actually believed the Comet Ping Pong allegations. “I just think you need to investigate. There are clues everywhere,” he said. “But I don’t agree with what happened at the restaurant.”

Mr. Welch has long supported family values, his friends said Monday. He briefly volunteered at the Locke Township Fire Department in Salisbury, according to the chief, Rusty Alexander. Friends described Mr. Welch as a doting father who loved the outdoors. While he had been arrested while driving impaired in 2013 and was sentenced to probation, the shooting on Sunday was out of character, his friends said.

“That’s not at all the person I know,” Louis Bodak, whose son Matthew is a good friend of Mr. Welch’s, said about the shooting.

1121,"The Black Swan Event They Didn’t Expect was first posted on Sate of the Nation on December 2, 2016.

When we first saw the Reddit thread in early November 2016 there were unsettling, bizarre pictures of children, so disturbing that we had to dig deeper and check all the links to make sure that the contributors were reposting from original sources. Everything seemed to check out and we knew without hesitation that this important citizen discussion needed to surface at the top of alternative media as soon as possible.

In this article you will also read about the real reason Matt Drudge and Alex Jones will never lead us to full disclosure, along with suggestions of topics that citizen investigators and journalists might undertake with their own articles and videos.

It was one of those moments that you knew you would remember for a lifetime, like where you were when you heard that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated or when the World Trade Center had been hit by airplanes. This time we knew that we could not stand by and let the main stream (fake) media grab the story and create their own narrative, propagandizing citizens so that their neural networks would echo “conspiracy theory” before the truth was exposed. Many of you probably felt the same and, in time, you will post your own stories of how you reacted to the pedophilia, Satanism revelation.

We felt that the Reddit thread would certainly get attention at some point in time. But how long would it take and would the MSM/CIA beat us to the narrative and create their own disinformation and propaganda thread? We had to get the information out to as many people in the alternative (truth) media community as soon as possible. This information was so explosive that any one of us, standing and reporting alone, might be in danger. Our community safety would be in our quick, explosive, many-front reactions with articles, posts, and videos detonating all over the internet.

We also knew that we would need to have a catchy name so that it could stand alone and viralize quickly. We needed an easy search word to identify the issue so that the alternative truth community could easily pick it up for hashtags, search words, memes, etc. Haven’t we all watched how slick George Soros executed “Black Lives Matter,” a meme that rolled out, complete with professionally printed signs and banners, overnight throughout several cities simultaneously? Soros probably had a marketing group come up with the logo and slogan, giving his paid protestors a flag that they could rally around on day one and give the media good imagery for their fake news stories.

This movement would need a powerful, yet simple slogan that we could all use for self-identification. We looked through the original Reddit thread and some other early posts and saw that a few people were calling it “pizzagate.” Worked for us!

Now to bring PizzaGate to the surface.

Thanks to our partnership since October 2015 with The Millennium Report and State of the Nation, we were able to get two of the earliest stories on PizzaGate trending in alt media. These two sites comprise a larger truth network known as The Mothership. To read more about this, see The Fifth Estate Casts its Shadow Like a Huge Mothership.)

We had been posting to their sites regularly since the San Bernardino false flag event, and the editors were keen to realize that we were writing about subjects that many other alternative sites would not touch. So when we sent them a copy of the Reddit thread on November 7, they did not hesitate to post immediately: Huge Breakthrough in D.C. Pedophilia Ring.

The first weighty article to hit Beforeitsnews.com on the D.C. pedophilia trended long and hard and citizen journalists wasted no time in creating messages for their own audiences—around the world.

Once the article started trending, we started working on research that might help fellow citizen journalists in seeing how deep the crime went, including the participation of the Catholic Church, law enforcement, charities and foundations:

In another article, we gave a shout out to the hard work the alternative truth community was doing in reporting the story, while the main stream media was calling us “fake news.”

Alternative Media is the New Guerrilla Warfare: Citizens Expose Globalists

Community of truth seekers: the videos and articles you are producing are amazing. Articles are being researched, cited, and written better every day. Videos are looking more interesting than anything the MSM produces on their so-called news channels. People are genuinely concerned about truth and transparency, calling each other out for poor sources, hoaxes, disinformation, and trolling.

Thinking Outside of the Box

As we move forward in redefining the way we report, distribute, and consume news, let’s think out of the box. Let’s be entrepreneurial in how we use our sources. For example, did you see how bounties and rewards are now being offered for investigations and research?

Natural News just announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to the source of PropOrNot news hoaxers behind the Washington Post Russian conspiracy fabrication.

PizzaGate Urban Explorers just announced a bounty to establish if there is a tunnel system under the Comet Ping Pong area. If you are an urban explorer, you might check out the hyperlink.

The Reddit thread investigation moved to Voat, a place where you can collaborate with others in your research and findings. https://voat.co/v/pizzagate

What talents and ideas do you have that you can contribute to the movement?

Our open-source citizen investigation has become a BLACK SWAN.

PizzaGate Can Take Us to A New World Awakening

In January 2016 we wrote an article entitled False Flags are Legal Propaganda by the Department of Defense. Those of you who are familiar with the article, you will know that we exposed the sophisticated psyop weapons that have been used against Americans to literally brainwash us into believing the state-controlled messaging. Participation by the main stream media is a key component in this narrative. Just an examination of the media’s blatant participation in the lies of 911 and Sandy Hook will show the lengths to which the shadow government will lie to people around the world to support their agendas.

KEY POINT: Many of our fellow citizens are still under a form of mind-control. They are still brainwashed.

Call it what you will: Stockholm Syndrome, mind-control, brainwashing, propaganda, cognitive dissonance.

Our job is to continue to wake them up, whether they are family or friends, colleagues or associates, with our voluminous posts, articles, and videos. We cannot leave this important work even to old alternative media outlets like Alex Jones or Drudge. Your article or video might be the very one to wake someone from their media stupor.

Plus, we know that our new Commander-In-Chief gets intel from alt media. Maybe it will be article or video that gets his attention. We ask our leaders to guide us to a NEW WORLD AWAKENING instead of the Bush-Soros-Rothschild New World Order.

Why Old Alt Media Won’t Get Us to Truth

Last week the Mothership queried us about an article that they were reviewing. (Drudging Up Jesuits) We were asked our opinion of the Drudge Report and InfoWars, specifically why we thought they never seem to take the alt media stories seriously, or “all the way.” For example, even as of today, Drudge Report has not mentioned PizzaGate. Or how about Alex Jones’s investigation of Antonio Scalia, just to mention one of Jones’ stories, where his reporters seemed to go “all out” with their on-location reporting at Cibolo Creek Ranch, but never carried the story any further than where Jones’ handlers probably permitted him to go.

We read the article and gave this summation:

“We don’t know what to make of this article. It seems convincing but it uses spurious sources for quotes, Spear of Destiny-Albert Pike, etc. It never gives us the direct provable associations it is trying to make. We are not convinced about Drudge or Jones being Jesuits. But remember – as the article correctly insinuated – some Jesuits are Jews and some Jews are controlled by the Jesuits who rewrote the Masonic rite of Fratres Lucis – The Illuminated Brothers — basically a Jesuit Masonic order written for elites including Jews.

Just because Drudge and Jones have Catholic associations doesn’t mean they are consciously doing the Vatican’s bidding. We notice that neither Drudge, Breitbart or Jones ever really “hit the target” and name the Jews or Jesuits or CIA. Are they blind to the truth that you guys have been posting? It doesn’t take a genius to see the different cabals, charities and organizations that try their best to run the world. They all fight viciously with each other for control of the flow of money. Jews join the Knights of Malta and vow allegiance to the Pope. Jewish bankers feed the charity fraud of the Catholic church. Sometimes they scratch each other’s backs and sometimes they are in open war.

The mission of Drudge, Jones, Savage, Breitbart, Limbaugh, and others like them are manifold. They have some good intentions, but they will be killed if they openly state the truth. We have watched Jones read our articles on the air up to a certain point, and then he drops the bottom line – He fails to follow through to name the culprits with the details that could prosecute them. Their job is to make you get upset, but also to discredit everything they say by running “crazy” articles that supposedly “prove” they are nuts.

Thus, the Department of Defense Board of Broadcasting Governors must approve everything that is broadcast in America now – including “fake news.” They, the military (plus Homeland Security, FBI, CIA, NIA, etc.), know exactly what these “fake news” outlets are saying. They want people to focus on the enemies that the news agencies are “allowed” to attack.

They broadcast propaganda using “spin” as a caricature or cartoon of the “real” to distract from the real and make themselves look foolish in the process. Thus, the truth that they do reveal is negated by their angry approach that takes no consequential actions. Alex Jones is a cartoon that basically vents the anger of Americans. He can’t be believed by most listeners because he yells all the time like a mad man; the same is true of Michael Savage. Both mad men have 50% of the truth and love to scream it out, but they effect little in the real world, except to vocalize the fears, anger and frustration of their listeners.

Drudge and Breitbart have yet to pick up a State of the Nation 2012 article that tells the truth (with evidence) about what they are supposed to be “all about,” but never really get there. When the editors at Breitbart announced that they were going to blow the lid off of a big story – he ended up dead before it was releasd.

So, either we, you, and the readers of these articles are the only people who know the simple truth – or all of the above named “news agencies” have an agenda to provide half truths and obscure the rest. You might not like to hear their true agenda.

Since virtually 96% of all major news outlets in America are owned or run by Jews (Ted Turner being the exception, but he is still a globalist). Therefore, anyone who doesn’t see that there is an American Jewish media cabal is simply blind. There is only ONE main stream medium outlet for news – it just comes in different packaging. All MSM is scrubbed cleaned by the NSA and other federal agencies before it is allowed to be READ ALOUD by supposed newscasters. Investigative journalism is not allowed by the media cabal and is often met with mysterious deaths. Therefore, no competition is allowed unless it is sanctioned: remember the untimely death of Breitbart. Only the internet gives some information freedom beyond DoD approved “broadcasting.”

Alex Jones is not interested in winning the war he is leading because he has no plan. We – Anonymous Patriots, State of the Nation, The Millennium Report, the Mothership know the truth. We need to stay focused on our purpose.

Trump is smart enough to have had a sense of the truth, but now he is learning the awful truth of the dark government that is in control of America. The war for the future of America is happening profoundly in Trump’s own heart at this moment. Usually, the CIA and its accomplices only tell the president the truth about the CIA after he enters the White House. But with Trump, he is finding out now through alternative media investigative journalism and through interviewing evil CIA operatives (Mitt Romney, Henry Kissinger, etc.) and finding out that the CIA is a non-American cabal that controls America and drives the war machine throughout the world and manipulates all markets with the stolen gold of numerous wars. Even the U. S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, IMF, World Bank, Exchange Stabilization Fund and other federal agencies are under the control of a CIA cabal that was developed by George Bush Sr. and the evil corporations that have arisen from his direction.

Presidents are told that a full-scale economic war is being waged and that he has little or no power over the direction it will take. Either presidents comply – or die. This has been the reality since Kennedy. Presidents are groomed through CIA training and indoctrination established by George Bush Sr. who has been in control of the cabal since before he became head of the CIA. Obama was like putty in the hands of the CIA cabal and that is why he has committed so many war crimes and atrocities and killed hundreds of thousands through his illegal bombing which has displaced tens of millions.

Obama’s grandparents, mother, both fathers and Michelle (Michael) were all CIA trained and indoctrinated. Obama’s personal records were sealed due to “National Security issues” because he was a CIA agent who was “planted” in the American “Weathermen” terrorist group, his father’s Muslim terrorist groups in Kenya, and his step-father’s Indonesia Muslim terrorist group, etc. Obama’s records will never be unsealed because his entire life story used in the MSM was fake. Obama was a “fake president” who used “fake media” to prop-up (propaganda) his “fake biography”, including a “fake birth-certificate”, “fake wife” and “two fake children.”

As an astute business man, Trump would be learning as much as possible from the people he is interviewing for cabinet positions. That is how he “sucked” this knowledge out of Mitt Romney who was a major CIA player with Bush Senior in taking down Russia. Mitt is CIA through and through and is a true Brush Crime Family Kingpin.

Have you ever heard any of these alternative media cites who are so called “revolutionary fighters for American freedom” ever call out the Jewish cabals or CIA or the true culprits of 911, Bush Sr. and his Iran/Contra gang?

Have they mentioned the dual citizenship of 70 congress members with the state of Israel?

Have they ever reported on pedophilia in the way alternative media has done recently? It isn’t like this just started happening; it has been around for decades. Why are the pedophile circles of Washington not being highlighted by these “freedom fighters.”

Why aren’t the culprits of 911 by called out and the evidence offered so that true patriots can carry the work further? Surely these news agencies know the simple truth because they read your sites and quote parts of articles that were originally posted on State of the Nation and throughout the Mothership.

Thus, there can be only one simple conclusion. Some alternative media sites, like the ones noted, are truly “fake media” just as are the traditional MSM sites. They are all scrubbed cleaned by the cabals that want Americans to remain asleep as their rights are eroded and their country hi-jacked by global forces of imperialistic fascism through the CIA and it accomplices.

Drudge, Breitbart and the angry alternative media makes sure to stay within the parameters of the agreements they made to remain a news agency. If they waiver beyond those agreed terms, their lives are in danger.

The article above on Matt Drudge as a Catholic agent is filled with the bias of the writer and doesn’t really bring forth the issues that would demonstrate the true nature of these pseudo-revolutionary news outlets. Drudge is not strictly disinformation – his site provides partial information with given parameters that he will not stray beyond. Plus, Drudge throws in “crazy” articles to discredit his sense of good judgment. In that way, even the truth is disregarded.

Angry alternative news outlets are a way to allow “news venting” wherein the reporter and the reader get to vent their anger and frustration that make them feel better but inevitably lead nowhere.

Members of the Fifth Estate, we have lots of work to do as our enemy now is not just globalism. OUR ENEMY IS EVIL. It is as simple as that. You are either with evil or not. There is no fence-sitting, hem-hawing, or neutrality in this apocalyptic war. So if your mega church pastor isn’t preaching about this on Sunday, you need to ask why.

If we are going to eradicate human trafficking and pedophilia, we will need to destroy the globalists and their EVIL on many fronts, not just the few low-level pedophiles that they will throw to us like meat to the lions. We need to grab the ring leaders, even though they lurk behind the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and political power. Yes, we are talking about asking the real questions that the old alternative media will not ask.

Like: Is Matt Drudge a Mossad agent, and is that why he was able to get the scoop about Monica’s dress that made his site explode overnight? Why hasn’t Drudge posted anything about Pizzagate?

There is plenty of truth that needs your special touch. But let’s stay focused on who we are targeting — evil in all its forms no matter how supposedly “high” the person is in the church, government, law-enforcement or other high ranking positions.

United had won an explosive game 2-0, with goals from Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney ending Arsenal’s 49-match unbeaten run.

Tempers flared over in the tunnel afterwards, with the Scot receiving a fresh slice of Margherita to the face.

The offender has been shrouded in mystery ever since, although Fabregas was always been the number one suspect.

In his autobiography released in 2013, Sir Alex explained: “My recollection of that fabled incident is that when Ruud van Nistelrooy came into the dressing room, he complained that Arsene Wenger had been giving him stick as he left the pitch.

“Right away I rushed out to say to Arsene: 'You leave my players alone.' He was incensed at losing the game. That was the reason for his combative behaviour.

”The next thing I knew I had pizza all over me. They say it was Cesc Fabregas who threw the pizza at me but, to this day, I have no idea who the culprit was.”

Martin Keown appeared to give the game away, by saying later: “From what I understand, it was a Spanish fella with great technique. Even when it came to the pizza he had great technique. He threw it like a Frisbee.”

Indeed, in an episode of ‘A League of Their Own’ set to be released this week the Spaniard confirmed his role in the incident, but suggested Keown wasn’t telling the whole truth.

Host of the Sky One show James Corden asks: “Tonight, can we finally put the case of the flying pizza to bed once and for all? Were you the culprit that threw the pizza?”

Fabregas replies, “yes!”, before explaining: “Martin Keown is a liar because I saw him in front of me just, like, punching people. So he didn't see anything.

“All of a sudden, I heard noises and I thought what's happening? So I go out with my slice of pizza and I saw Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, Martin Keown... everyone pushing each other.

“I was like 'I want to get in but I don't know how to' and I threw... peeew... just threw it. Once I saw it was hitting, like, who it was hitting, which I didn't mean…”

“They are crimes of special concern to the FBI and to law enforcement generally,” Special Agent in Charge Matt Alcoke told Channel 2. “Because the victims are so vulnerable as children and because the offenders could be from just about any walk of life, from a gang member all the way up to someone who is highly successful and wealthy.”

In total, the sting ensnared 150 traffickers. Approximately 160 children, including some as young as 3-years-old were rescued.

According to Alocke, the sting was specifically timed to catch these predators before summer started as the trade tends to prey on children when they are out of school.

This case illustrates how sinister and outright dangerous it is for the supposed arbiters of truth like Snopes, to immediately write off any allegations of child trafficking as “conspiracy theory” and fake news.

“A lot of people don’t realize these things happen here,” department spokesman Howard Miller said. Indeed, they do not realize it, and the mainstream media often seems like they are in denial when it comes to the severity of child trafficking happening within the United States.

This sting comes on the heels of a controversial topic out of Tuscon, Arizona in which a group of veterans claims to have discovered a child trafficking camp on property belonging to Cemex.

Snopes attempted to debunk the story by claiming that the Free Thought Project said that the area was a child trafficking camp.

However, we did not. We merely reported what the veterans group said as these allegations most assuredly deserved scrutiny. In our report, we noted that it could also be a homeless camp.

However, because Snopes falsely accused this outlet of spreading fake news, the story has been scrubbed from Facebook and the thousands of users who shared the story—which could’ve helped to expose child trafficking—received a notification like the one below, warning them that they have shared something false.

Snopes—whether deliberately or not—is actively engaging in censorship of content that could actually help children by engaging others and fostering discussion.

Instead of allowing the discussion to continue, Snopes deliberately shut down the conversation, ensuring that the very important topic of child trafficking is forced into the memory hole and never heard of again.

As the above case illustrates, child trafficking is a horrifying reality. While some Pizzagate scenarios may not be real, there are far worse incidents taking place across the country.

It is no longer a secret that throughout all levels of the Hollywood establishment there is rampant sexual abuse. This abuse is also rampant throughout government. It has become such a problem that millions of your tax dollars are funneled to cover it up.

Sadly, it appears, that the more monsters who get exposed for crimes against children, the more society—with the help of the mainstream media—become complacent about this reality.

The idea that someone could easily dismiss the allegations of rampant child trafficking among America’s elite as a conspiracy theory is irresponsible at best, and complicit at worst.

On multiple occasions, the Free Thought Project has reported interviews of former child sex trafficking victims who’ve all noted that they had nowhere to go as police and high-level politicians all took place in the abuse.

In case after case, the Free Thought Project reports on horrifying instances of child sex rings that were allowed to go on for decades because politicians — including heads of states — policemen, clergy, and others were all in on the sick game.

This can no longer go on. In an article after the Hollywood scandal blew up last year, The Huffington Post wrote that “Since Harvey Weinstein’s downfall, we as a society have apparently decided to try this radical new idea called ‘believing women.’”

Well, how about we, as a society, start believing children too—and stop dismissing every claim of child trafficking as a conspiracy theory without first being able to have a rational discussion about it?

Until this happens, predators in high places will enjoy the lack of scrutiny and these ‘arbiters of truth’ will be inadvertently aiding in the cover-up of their crimes.

221,"So what, exactly, do QAnon adherents believe? The central theme is that President Trump is a near-messianic figure who is besieged by threats from evil government officials.

The sprawling conspiracy theory started in October 2017, when a user of the online message board 4chan began writing cryptic posts under the name Q Clearance Patriot, claiming to be a high-ranking official privy to top-secret information from Mr. Trump’s inner circle.

Since then, the QAnon universe has expanded to include a series of outlandish claims. Mr. Trump was recruited by the military to run for office in order to break up a global cabal of Democratic pedophiles (remember Pizzagate?). The special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation would end up sending prominent Democrats to be imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay. John F. Kennedy Jr. is still alive and is going to replace Vice President Mike Pence on the 2020 Republican ticket.

While these statements are ridiculous, they can also put real people in danger. Last year, the F.B.I. put out an intelligence bulletin identifying QAnon and other fringe conspiracy theories as a potential domestic terror threat. People said to have been radicalized by QAnon have been charged with crimes including attempted kidnapping and murder.

Still, the president has played right along, at times at times elevating and encouraging QAnon followers. He’s recirculated their posts on Twitter, posed with one for a photograph in the Oval Office, and invited some QAnon believers to a White House “social media summit.”

“I can’t say whether President Trump believes QAnon, but he certainly is willing to use conspiracy rhetoric to his advantage,” said Joanne Miller, who studies the political psychology of conspiracy theories at the University of Delaware. “That could be part of what’s emboldening QAnon believers to come out of the shadows.”

Joseph Uscinski, an expert on conspiracy theories at the University of Miami, has a simple theory: “Conspiracy theories are for losers.” Generally, the party in power doesn’t need to support a theory essentially undermining the government it controls.",mainstream,M19fec,pizzagate
553,"In the days before an armed man stormed into a local pizza restaurant looking to “self-investigate” fake news reports, several nearby businesses had been receiving what they called “disturbing” and “graphic” threats.

“Sometimes they would call 10-15 times an hour saying: ‘We are going to kill you!’” said Bradley Graham, the co-owner of Politics and Prose, a popular bookstore near Comet Ping Pong, the restaurant at the center of the fake news stories that alleged a child sex ring involving the Hillary Clinton campaign.

“They were disgusting, grotesque and violent death threats,” added his co-owner, Lissa Muscatine, who also received personal threats on her Twitter account.

The calls unsettled the business owners, as the fake news stories mushroomed into a rightwing internet conspiracy – one of a host fabricated reports that proliferated this election season. They grew wary of strange visitors who showed up at their stores taking pictures and asking about secret tunnels. They wondered if the threats would grow into something bigger, something dangerous.

Then on Sunday afternoon, police say 28-year-old Edgar Welch of Durham, North Carolina, showed up in Comet wielding an assault rifle, shooting it three times. According to criminal charges filed late Monday, Welch told police that he “read online that Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there”. There were no reported injuries and Welch “surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant”, police said.

Nearby business owners expressed relief on Monday that it wasn’t something worse.

Abdel Hammad, the owner of Besta Pizza, located three doors from Comet, found his store dragged into the mess when internet conspiracies drew a connection to the vague resemblance between his restaurant’s logo and a symbol apparently used by pedophiles. Hammad, an Egyptian immigrant who barely knows Comet’s owners and did not support Clinton, said he has received constant, alarming calls for three weeks.

“They were threatening to blow our heads off and blow our store up and blow (up) our entire organization,” Hammad said.

At one point, Hammad grew so angry with the calls that he challenged one of them to “show up and show his face”.

“He hung up, it was all talk,” Hammad said. “Nobody showed up.”

“But now someone has,” he said.

He said he reported several of the calls to the police but said “nothing happened”. This even after an incident several days ago in which his manager, Ibrahima Diallo, confronted two women who had come to the counter asking to see the tunnels. When Diallo tried to chase them out, he said they slammed the door on his hand, breaking it. Diallo was able to get the plate number off the women’s car but when he gave it to police he said he was told: “It’s a civil matter, there’s nothing we can do.”

DC police spokeswoman Margarita Mikhaylova said they had “not received reports of specific threats” from businesses neighboring Comet Ping Pong.

She added that officers had advised store employees in the area to report threats.

“We want to ensure the community that their safety is our priority as we have committed additional police resources to that area,” she wrote in an email on Monday.

Comet Ping Pong employees said they experienced a similar string of threats in the weeks leading up to the shooting. The fake news story first emerged in the days before the election when campaign manager John Podesta’s emails were hacked and and published on WikiLeaks. Online conspiracy theorists found emails to Comet’s owner James Alefantis about potential fundraisers. Some online posters scoured Comet’s Facebook and Instagram pages pulling photos of children posted by their parents and suggested that Comet was actually part of a secret child sex ring run by Democrats. They tracked down signs promoting events at the restaurant and said the artwork depicted child sex scenes. They parsed the WikiLeaks emails picking out words like “hot dog” and “cheese” and said they were possible codes being used by pedophiles to set up orgies.

Because John Podesta’s brother Tony is an occasional customer at the popular north-west DC pizzeria, direct connections were made and the fake allegations dubbed “Pizzagate” blew up on Reddit and Facebook. The threats followed. First to Comet, then Besta Pizza and then Politics and Prose, which Muscatine helped buy after working as a speechwriter for Hilary Clinton – an association that allowed some to allege that underground sex trafficking tunnels were connecting the businesses.

On Monday both Graham and Muscatine, former Washington Post writers, were forced to look reporters in the eye and say with a straight face that no tunnels existed beneath their store. “Our business is not connected in any physical way with any of the other stores,” Graham said wearily. They had reported the death threats to their district council representative and wondered why it had taken a man with a gun to finally draw interest from the police.

Outside the store window sat two police cars. In a late-day meeting Monday with business owners who expressed their fears of other violence, police officials promised to increase their presence, Graham said. They and the mayor’s representatives also told the store owners they would look more at this new phenomenon of fake news and see how to better react.",mainstream,M1e2bb,pizzagate
705,"What made the Emperor Nero tick, Suetonius writes in “Lives of the Caesars,” was “a longing for immortality and undying fame, though it was ill-regulated.” Many Romans were convinced that Nero was mentally unbalanced and that he had burned much of the imperial capital to the ground just to make room for the construction of the Domus Aurea, a gold-leaf-and-marble palace that stretched from the Palatine to the Esquiline Hill. At enormous venues around the city, he is said to have sung, danced, and played the water organ for many hours—but not before ordering the gates locked to insure that the house would remain full until after the final encore.

548,"Alfonso Cuaron Orozco received an Academy Award in the best director category for his much-hyped film “Roma” despite its lacking both the nostalgic humor necessary to a family drama as well as the sort of innocent naivete in a remembrance of childhood. His visual strategy of piling on ponderous images overwhelms the audiences, thereby keeping viewers in a gullible stupor, if for no other reason to divert attention away from its whitewash of mass murder of hundreds, and more like thousands, of idealistic students. The financing for this con job came from Participant Media, which churns out CIA-friendly propaganda like “Syriana”, “Darfur” and that paranoiac weather report from Agency patron Al Gore.

Flashback to 911, on a flight over Chicago, and the lanky passenger sitting next to me introduces himself as an editor with a new streaming-media company called Netflix, who urges me as a writer of intelligence-related articles to send my resume to “the Canadian guy who makes the decisions and fronts the money for productions,” citing a name.

I asked: “Is he Jewish?” Nod. “So what’s the point when he’s going to rip me off?”

My Yid pals on Flatbush and Fairfax are surely laughing at that zinger.

The avoidance strategy had to eventually fail, as it just did, now with the Yid-pic “Roma”, which was financed by Participant CEO Jeffrey Skoll, the said Canadian who serves as one of the Hollywood cut-outs for the Office of Public Affairs (OPA, which sounds a lot like opioid for the masses), the Agency’s bureau for public mind-control and propaganda.

Excuse me once again, this time for the two-track approach deployed below, a critical-theory cinema review of a Jewish melodrama in Mexico alongside a counter-intelligence analysis of Yanqui spies high on tequila and cocaina. From my archaic slang it can be surmised that I’m a survivor of those halcyon years and often went south of the Border for mezcal shots while waiting for a craftsman to complete a 12-string guitar in the silent space between the balas, which is Spanish for “bullets”.

As the motive force that paid the death squads that conducted the sort of massacres depicted in “Roma”, the CIA has a keen interest in toning down or editing out critical parts of the modern history of Mexico City, an important chapter in clandestine operations and in fact one of its finest achievements. The intel offices inside the US Embassy within the DF (Distrito Federal, the capital) served as an offshore ops center against Castro Cuba with its political inroads into Gulf+Western’s Dominican Republic and United Fruits’ Central America.

The Agency’s more venal interest in Mexico derived from the steady unreported income for off-the-books blacks ops and payoffs thanks to the generosity of its business partners out of Sinaloa, Michoacan and Juarez. (A substantial part of that Yanqui cut, of course, gets cycled and cleansed through Hollywood, Vegas and the Democratic Party of California.) Therefore, let’s explore how “Roma” whitewashes the CIA crimes in 1960s-70s Mexico before delving into its other more grotesque themes.

Cuaron chose to focus on the Corpus Christi day massacre of 1971 rather the more revealing Tlatelolco Plaza nighttime massacre in October 1968. At the time, the American ambassador Fulton Freeman was a high-ranking member of the Department of State’s diplomatic intelligence service (he went on to serve as president of the Monterey Institute) and had a previous posting in Paris. Just days after the French student protests toppled the de Gaulle government, as youth revolts and anti-Vietnam war movements were mushrooming across the USA and worldwide. Later in early autumn antiwar protests at the Chicago Democratic National Convention shattered public confidence in the war effort, effectively tolling the bell for the LBJ war policy.

Panic was gripping Langley and Foggy Bottom with the realization that Washington was not just facing defeat in Vietnam but also was about to lose everything else. Envoy Freemen called an emergency meeting of his intelligence staff to quell the swelling protest marches pouring out of universities throughout Mexico. Paranoia strikes deep and into one’s heart it will creep.

The CIA station chief Winston “Scottie” Scott did not buy into the End of Empire scenario and enjoyed nothing better than a life-and-death crisis with the clear understanding that it was the opposition that must do the dying, even though they may be just college kids with naive ideas about a better world. In preparing for just such a scuffle, Scottie had bribed President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, and his family for good measure, and right-hand fixer Luis Echeverria, and the capital cops for good measure, since Yanqui dinero went a long ways then, especially for Operation TEMPO, the buying of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).

However much their hundreds of field agents and thousands of paid informers tired, the vast spy network could not come up with a single instance of Cuban or garden-variety communist subversion inciting the students, who were fiercely focused on realizing a democracy since capitalism wasn’t much of a menace to the lower classes in a Mexican economy dominated by state-own monopolities.

Without a smoking gun, the CIA did the next best thing, which was to false flags by organizing fake terror cells, of criminals posing as students armed with AKs from China with serial numbers filed off and recruiting a Trotskyite splinter group to plant dud explosives on power transformers in the city center. Alfonso Cuaron based his student protest scenes on notes, photos and newsclippings left by his late uncle, a Trotskyite in the phony bomb plot. Like uncle like nephew, it’s the same game of duplicity, eh, ninos? Truthfulness is not one of Cuaron’s assets.

Trotsky in Mexico has cultic status. After his escape from the purge in Stalin’s Moscow, Leon Trotsky fled to Mexico, where he was lionized by the Jewish artist Diego Rivera, who was patronized by John D. Rockefeller for the famous Ford Motor mural in Detroit. Just prior to the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Jew Trotsky had found favor on a tour of the United States with the German-Jewish banker Jacob Schiff with the Loeb, Kuhn and partners, the financial firm underwritten by the house of Rothschild in Frankfurt, Germany. He got a blank check to take Russia out of World War I, to save the Rothschild homeland. The founder of the Red Army ended up dying ingloriously with an icepick in his temple inserted by a Comintern agent, so his followers wanted revenge at any price on the left however they could get it, and thus the false flag operation involving an attempted city blackout.

Trotskyism certainly was not in the mainstream of the uber-wealthy Jewish financiers and merchants in the Polanco District or in Cuaron’s boyhood neighborhood of Colonia Roma, comprising middle-class Sephardic Jews from Aleppo and Damascus, Syria, most of them professionals, including engineers, teachers and physicians as seen in the film.

What I’ve just written, the comedy of a misguided Jewish radical caught up in a CIA entrapment scheme that shames his conservative immigrant family, should have been the narrative of a retrospective film on Mexico in its moment of crisis amid a massive economic-political transition. Instead, audiences have been presented with an over-aestheticized simulacrum that pretends to be a childhood autobiography but then morphs into neo-fascist visual orgy with backhanded praise for state-sponsored repression. Since there has been so much adulation for the Cuaron “masterpiece”, let me change hats from helmet to a physician’s cap to start dissecting this monstrosity. But first, this.

So what transpired in the plaza that on the night of October 2, 1968? Thousands of students from Polytechnic University poured onto the streets to march for democracy. Meanwhile CIA-directed military snipers dress in plainclothes were positioned on the roof and doorways of the Chihuahua building overlooking Tlateloloco Plaza with orders to shoot anyone trying to escape the square, which was surrounded by riot police. Once the plaza was filled, the hail of lead was so intense that 16 police officers sustained gunshot wounds, their injuries blamed on students. An accurate death count was never conducted since most were dragged off to mass graves, with latter-day estimates in the hundreds. At the time, the Spanish radio stations and underground press estimated 2,300 unarmed protesters were killed. Nowadays, we hear a lot from the US media about Tiananmen Square, but what happened in Mexico City was far worse yet has been met with stony silence from the mainstream media.

The Mexico City Olympics proceeded on schedule later that month, but was interrupted at an awards ceremony when two American sprinters defiantly raised their fists in protest at state-sponsored mass murder around the world, including inside the United States against their brethen. And now, four decades after, Alfonso Cuaron feels honored to receive the blood-soaked dollars from these murderers.

Mexican Mothers Need Abortion

 

 The ostensible aim in “Roma” is to spotlight courageous women in a family crisis, yet a more disturbing agenda emerges with a sinister assault on the birth rate among the nation’s impoverished masses. The heroism on display arises not from the protagonist, a pregnant housekeeper named Cleo, nor even the soft-spoken grandmother Teresa, the matriarch who rises to the challenge of wading through gunfire to escort the maid in the throes of contractions to a maternity ward. No, it is the bombshell revelation amid an earthquake.

The consequence of these praiseworthy and charming women’s ordeals is not some deserved reward that compensates life’s slings and arrows, but to the contrary the politically correct conclusion that losing an infant is better than adding another mouth to feed for Mexico. Moving on, the story then takes a turn toward darkness, when the unsung male heroes of “Roma” are shown to be those fearless young men in the death squads holding the lid down on per capita consumption and ensuring population reduction by any means. With my apologies to the rationality of the human-rights crowd, “Roma” is an ethical crime against humanity.

The ballistic arc of this weaponized film aims for shrinkage of the demographic majority of impoverished masses that in images through the film are treated as statistical data rather than sympathetically as fellow citizens and people in need. Newton’s rule is, however, that what goes up must come down under the pull of “Gravity”, especially the birth rate. Cleo’s acceptance of trauma is the solution for Latin America according to the pseudo-science of the Rockefellers and Gates.

More victim than heroine, the maid Cleo is caught between the cruel ambitions of her lover and Catholic society’s inbred resistance to abortion, which Cuaron sadistically twists through the unquestioning happy reaction of all the women to news of the pregnancy. As if gunshots and quake are not enough, then comes a grotesque scene of the coldly clinical delivery of her still-born corpse, followed up by a medic gingerly wrapping the tiny corpse, presumably to harvest its stem cells, a lucrative trade to supply the ultra-rich with rejuvenation treatment. Across the developing world, newborns are now a biochemical resource to be extracted like a gas field or a mineral mine containing lithium, just another raw material plundered by the technology-driven economy of the post-human future.

Given his opposition to church influence in a profoundly spiritual Mexican society, the director had a professional responsibility to disclose that his childhood home in the upper-middle class neighborhood of Colonia Roma happened to be predominantly Jewish in that time-frame of the 1970s. His glaring omission of ethnicity would be as if Joan Micklin Silver’s “Hester Street” or Woody Allen’s entire oeuvre remained in denial of Jewish identity in New York City. Even with the pictorial-overflow from “Roma”, the missing ingredient of Jewish secularism leaves image-bloated viewers with a puzzling feeling of hollowness, sort of like eating Chinese food in Queens.

To clarify, I am not an opponent of abortion rights to protect a girl’s right to a career or escape constant reminder of a foolish mistake or a criminal assault. I do, however, strongly object to the unethical methods used to entice medical professionals into terminating embryos for the not-so hidden agenda of preserving the world’s natural resources for ownership by tycoons and expanding the political authority of globalist neoliberal bureaucrats. For Cuaron to preach the “necessity” of a child’s death in contrast to his squeamish flinching from the taxidermist-mounted heads of pet dogs on the wall of a hacienda is hypocrisy. Animals have a right to a proper burial that the children of the poor don’t deserve? Welcome to the warped ethos of post-human futurism.

In the Distrito Federal (DF), within core Mexico City, the unspoken controversy over population limits is a faultline between a Catholic majority and progressive professional class under secular influence rooted in the Jewish districts of Polanco and Colonia Roma (the latter significantly depopulated following the 1989 earthquake), both in the northeast quadrant of the capital.

The site for Colonia Roma was once a small Aztec village, which was cleared of its indigenous inhabitants for development by an Englishman who was the ringmaster of the Orrin Brothers traveling circus. Colonia Roma became a settlement for Syrian Jews fleeing Arab nationalists soon after the collapse of the cosmopolitan Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I. The district is subdivided into two neighborhoods, its northern section for self-exiled shopkeepers from the souks of Damascus and Roma South inhabited by Aleppo Jews, shopkeepers and professionals. In the late 1940s, the rise of Baathist Arab socialist movements in Syria and Iraq increased the pressure on Jews to emigrate due to the creation of Israel, thereby adding to the Jewish minority in Mexico.

The immigrant parents, as depicted in the quiet grandmother Teresa, never attained proficiency in Spanish, as so aptly shown by her linguistic fumbling at the hospital reception desk (one of the most touching scenes of this film). The second generation Syrian-Mexicans of Roma attended local schools and most enjoyed as good or better living standards than their local classmates, thereby advancing to university and professional life. The spacious Ford Galaxy with its powerful engine was a status symbol then, prior to the advent of luxury cars from Germany and Japan.

The myopic conservatism of Roma inhabitants was, however, only half the story since, as in the case of most well-to-do immigrant groups worldwide, cash donations to politicians was an unspoken act of “good relations” reducing the odds of persecution. This contact with the politicians and bureaucrats would gradually integrate a younger Jews into the political arena and corporate world, take for example Maronite-Catholic Syrian Carlos Slim or Vicente Fox, a descendant of the German-Jewish Fuchs who converted to Catholicism in the US. In the footsteps of Japan’s economic miracle, Mexico’s economy underwent a drastic transformation starting in the early 1960s driven by export-oriented industries, especially maquiladores along the US border, and by the ‘80s emerging as a global financial center, with subsequent ramifications of deregulation and private-owned corporate enterprise.

For the Sephardim from the Near East and Mediterranean regions, social and cultural progress were not stymied by rigid religious customs as, for example, among the ultra-traditionalist Lubavitcher Jews from the Baltics and Romania. Unlike many Ashkenazim who had historical grievances against religious-based pogroms in Europe and Russia, the Sephardim had been embedded in Semitic cultures with common dietary rules and few divergent practices other than going to mosque or temple. A sensible degree of tolerance is the most effective suppressor of religious zeal. The secularism in Roma can be seen in the scraggly Christmas tree in the no-surname family’s living room.

This complacency over religious and social issues of Sephardim in Mexico was abetted by their wealth, garnered from money-lending to Arabs crimped by anti-usury rules and the same relationship developed with the Christians in the New World. The Sephardim were content with their social status as “Jews with Money” and the privileges conferred by personal wealth.

Their comfort zone contrasted with the anarchist and communist radicalism of Yiddish-speaking immigrants to the US and Canada who had arrived from Eastern Europe and Russia to Ellis Island with only a few thin dollars in their pockets, they being “Jews without money”.

Thus, economic privilege enabled Roma and the upper-class stronghold of Polanco to remain aloof from the deepening crisis over economic inequity in the expansionary national economy. Cuaron was only 8-years-old at the time of the bloody pre-Olympics massacre, and as the film indicates in the character “Pepe, or Pepon” he was a mama’s boy, not at all a child of the streets and was happier playing with his train set than going outside. Cuaron has recalled that his interest in the brutal events that gripped Mexico City arose when he discovered a collection of photos and news clippings among the belongings of his late uncle, who was a Trotskyite, these items probably provided by CIA operatives planning a false-flag attack on the metropolitan power supply to implicate students in a “communist terror plot”.

Avoiding the by-now-forgotten debates between leftist factions of four decades ago, Cuaron as filmmaker became instead engrossed in the visual artistry potential of the right-wing militia formations skirmishing with the hapless students. What obviously piqued his intense curiosity was the fetishism of fascistic masculine identity, derived from the technology-cult of Marinetti’s Futurism and the body-focused narcissism of Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima, who penned the far-right classic “Sun and Steel”, the gospel of neofascism.

To quote this masterwork: “Why, still, should the lust for ascension seem, in itself, so close to madness? Nothing exists that can satisfy me; earthly novelty is too soon dulled. I am drawn higher and higher, more unstable, closer and closer to the sun's illuminance.”

That explains Cuaron’s images of airplanes overhead, Professor Zovek’s claim of levitation; and the scene from the space opera that inspired Curon’s sci-fi “Gravity”.

It can be surmised that the wimpy liberal Alfonso Cuaron is like one of those children who on first sight are frightened out of their wits at encountering a poisonous snake but then gingerly tries to pick it up and then becomes an obsessive snake-hawk. Since the thought crops up in your dirty little minds, the same goes for penises. D.H. Lawrence’s “Plumed Serpent” is likewise a paean to the renewal of his boyhood sexual experiments later on a sojourn in New Mexico’s Indian country. It’s skipping along the path into deep fascism.

The maid’s samurai-obsessive boyfriend summarizes the iconographics of the male body in a single word: “foco”, as through a camera lens or gun-sights, to always keep focus at the center of one’s mind. As a male who’s spent his entire life in the close company of older women, Cuaron was obviously gob-smacked by the discovery of the body politic, displayed with frontal nudity and a reverse of Felix as he swings a rod with Japanese sword technique, merging sex with death, before laying down on the bed to bonk the shy maid. As to the long and short of these rods, the philosophically pornographic scene is classic Rough Trade, the nightly feast for the CIA thugs and their Jesuit go-betweens, catered by the Halcones with cojones followed by a sweet dessert of little boys from the Los Pequenos orphanage run by Fr. William Wasson (for the latter, see at rense.com my Pizzagate 10 article on Wasson and Dr. Maccony along with the Haiti child-sex trade).

Oy, Alfonso, we expected the uncovering of Yanqui spies not a gay stripshow! “Roma” is the stuff of CIA agent wet dreams. Is Cuaron one of “them”? I mean here spooks. Well, he does live a posh lifestyle in London, not in some miserable barrio, with a multi-millionaire’s ex-wife and hopes to rival George Clooney in celebrity status and foreign adventurism, so go figure, if they are wannabe James Bonds.

The question that crosses my mind as I recall the disturbing scene is: Why hasn’t any reviewer dared to mention the perversity? Were they too engrossed or simply swept off their feet by that demonstration of raw power and sex? Power, in the figure of Felix, the aspiring youth from the underclass, is the very image of the Aztec warriors, the Spaniard conquistadors, the bandoliered jefes of the Mexican Revolution, those hard men who created Mexico out of dust and blood.

Therefore as a novice true believer, Cuaron fails utterly in his attempted parody of Professor Zovek, a mesmeric demagogue whose stunts and cult-like mantras succeed in brainwashing the trainees for the Falcon death-squad. (Zovek was a television super-hero rumored to be involved in paramilitary training with Army intelligence.) Overseeing the progress of the baton exercises are a Korean martial-arts instructor and a Yanqui overseer from the CIA. As across much of Latin America, the militarist-minded right harbors enormous respect for Imperial Japan for daring to assault the hate white colonial powers without fear or hesitation, a fanaticism that was continued into the Cold War and Vietnam conflict by the South Korean Tiger Division in its ruthless suppression of radical nationalists. This idolatry of masculine violence is treated by Cuaron as a wake-up call into adulthood for the effete little boy clinging to his surrogate mother.

The terse scene at the training field concludes with Felix disowning his pregnant lover with an overt threat against Cleo, now that he is assured of advance through the ranks of the Central Intelligence and Security Agency and an eventual marriage with a mestizo instead of a lowly Mixtec indio from Oaxaca, a pretty picture indeed.

What I would do now for a shot of mezcal with a gusano from inside the agave. The German cultural theorist Walter Benjamin stated that “aestheticization of politics” is a basic feature of fascism. “Roma” is precisely within the canon of fascist art, and certainly not the progressive message that it pretends to be for hipsters. Cuaron’s film is a purist demonstration of the impact of imagery over the nuances of language, and the reviewers have been knocked senseless and bowled over.

Fascistic order is not reserved for men only. Women, too, must answer the demand for obedience, sacrifice and loyalty, whatever the emotional cost. Toward the movie’s ending, Cleo expresses her unequivocal loyalty to her mistress’s family in that gratuitous rescue scene of the servant who never learned to swim courageously wading through the waves like a loyal dog to rescue the girl Sofi and young Pepe the pepito. Her march across the beach into the threatening sea captures the essence of Triumph of the Will, sheer superhuman determination of a Valkyree against all odds for the love of something greater than one’s little possession in swaddling. Servitude and sacrifice, the constant refrain on the parade toward apocalyptic destruction.

If this essay was for a lecture in a film class, I would dwell on its many untidy technical flaws, including the jerkiness and loss of focus (foco!) in transitions from pans to tilts, and distorted edges in moving wide-angle shots that can cause seasickness for viewers, the selective ambient sound, the unnatural wave motion in the opening scene, and the excessive speed and improbable activity in the panoramic landscapes. These flaws were not due to a lack of funding, considering the fact that one quiet shot required 45 cameras. This is NOT cinema, it is on-screen virtual reality. All of these errors surely led to downgrade by members of the Academy. The other problem noted by a fellow cultural writer is that film’s digital black-and-white lacks the sheen, halo and softer tonality of the silver-salt processing of the silver screen era of real film.

The greater stylistic problem with “Roma” is its whimsical switching between genres, with its aspiration for a neo-Realist cinema verite style of the 1970s being interrupted by Surrealist juxtapositions, for example the stuntman shot out of a cannon leading building up to a rock band leader and the risk-taking Felix. There’s also an all-too coincidental wedding scene following Sophia’s announcement to the children of the impending divorce. Then there’s the heavy-handed symbolism of the sea as an existential threat, the sky as promise of freedom, a watch dog as stand-in for domestic loyalty, and the wide-body Ford Galaxy as family unity; and most blatant of all, the broken cup. The abundance of visual symbols get in the way of telling a simple reality-based tale of loss and redemption, which Cuaron should have stuck to instead of this operatic disaster.

Over and Out

While Cleo and Felix are condemned to lead infertile existences under the new order that was modernizing Mexico, the divorcee Sofia makes the financial decision to quit her low-paying job as a biochemistry teacher to work at a salaried position at a publishing house. In devotion to her four children, she rejected the advances of a male friend at the hacienda. In a neoliberl era of integration into a global economy, sterility is therefore the solution for a Mexico to leave behind the chaos, turmoil and bloodshed of the past along with artistic vision, music, drunken joy and spiritual passion. As put by Madonna in “Die Another Day”: “I’m going to close my body now.” Get thee to the nunnery.

The film ends with the two older brothers, each alone in his thoughts, staring at the relentless Mexican landscape on the drive back from the depressing beach vacation, which was a ploy to allow their father to move out of the Roma house without meeting the children he abandoned. This single scene works powerfully because it non-consciously captures the alienation of being Jewish in an overwhelmingly Catholic society where everyone else has a comforting belief in eternal salvation, since there’s not much else to this temporal life. Mexico is just not as much fun as it once was.

“Roma” begs for commentary, which could fill the Encyclopedia of Mexico, so to summaries a few salient points:

First, the 1970s saw the sunset on the hacienda elite, depicted in the New Year’s Eve party and forest fire, versus the rise of an export-oriented industrial sector. This transition moved the nation’s core economic policy away from agriculture and state monopolies toward the neoliberal investment strategies favoring private corporations and the rise of tycoons. The firefighting scene was a false note meant to signify the reunification of community after the gunfight over land rights, with the lone exception of the drug-craze brother of the white woman oblivious to the emergency and singing a Christian hymn.

Second, the story-line follows the pendulum swing described in the Dal Bo and Di Tella theory of “Plato O Plomo” (Silver or Lead), the symbols for bribery and punishment in national politics. Political donors in Jewish Polanco use bribes to control the Mexican assembly and the presidential executive, which on the other side of the religious aisle are under coercion from the traditionalist military and Catholic clergy. Balance of power.

Third, in that period of transition, the left-liberal faction within the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) split off as the PRD or Party of Revolutionary Democracy, aligned with the Rothschild-backed Second International, which committed its own massacre of students at Iguala in 2014 as “proof” to Washington of its fitness to rule. The PRD has since been bypassed by one of its offshoots, which forms the current reformist government under the president known as AMLO, who is now trying to balance nationalist ideals with neoliberal financial policy.

Fourth, his Jewish circle in the film department of National Autonomous University includes cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and fellow filmmaker Carlos Markovich.

Fifth: While presenting himself as an indy filmmaker and despite the anti-Western statements in “Roma”, the truth about his phony nationalism is closer to his residence in London, and elite connections, exemplified by his female partner Sheherazade Bentley, the divorced wife of Zac, British scion of the Goldsmith fortune in London. Cuaron’s cultural bipolarity was vented in the hacienda scene at his rage against the gun culture of the English-speaking landlord and his blonde lady from abroad. The film is there not about childhood but centered on a childish adult using the media for a personal vendetta. Woody Allen meet your kindred soul. Mazel tov!

Sixth: The ringmaster of a traveling circus who founded Colonia Roma, the Englishman Edward Walter Orrin who headed the Orrin Brothers Circus, named the district in honor of ancient Rome with its social-contrl policy of “Panem et Circenses” (bread and circuses) at the original Circus Maximus racecourse and that popular entertainment center with its leaping big cats called the Colosseum, where early followers of Jesus were torn apart and devoured to be replaced by the Sanhedrin’s pseudo-Christian cabal that would dominate the Vatican in the struggle against the apostolic Orthodox Church of the East, as is now happening in Ukraine, the homeland of the Khazarian Ashkenazi Jews. As “Roma” shows, that which goes unmentioned could be the most important factor of all.

Seventh: Occultism is alive wherever the Jesuits venture, and the upper-class Jewish-predominant Polanco district is no exception being named after Juan Alfonso de Polanco, the private secretary of Ignatius de Loyola, the founding Superior General of the Jesuit military order (Society of Jesus, IHT). The Polanco family had its origins in a converso (converted Jews) Bishop Paul of Burgos, formerly known as Rabbi Solomon Ha-Levi, whose penetration of the Church is one of the clearest examples of Kabbalist infiltration into Christianity and the complicity of the self-appointed “Inquisitors” as protectors of hidden Jewry, a role that resumed with Jesuit seminarian Adam Weishaupt’s founding of the Order of Illuminati and, of course, the present-day Jesuit Vatican. Note that Cuaron’s given name is the same as the converso Jesuit father.

The Jesuits in Mexico took special interest in the legends, customs and arts of the Mayans, Toltecs and Aztecs who practiced pre-Christian paganism. Particular interest was given to evil spirits as cultural equivalents of Satan, Lucifer and the like. A key scene in which traditional folk belief haunts Cleo follows Felix’s break-up, his abandoning the child she is carrying on that Day of the Dead, as street vendors jiggle tiny skeletons around her, in premonition of the still-birth of their daughter, yet another ham-fisted attempt at symbolism. The paramilitary marching ban is also another death image, a premotion of the funeral dirges for the students who are soon to be massacred.

Even the sparse Christmas tree, as a pagan symbol of renewal, in the secular Jewish home indicates the fallow harvest from the father’s career in Euro-American medicine and the grim future without gifts that awaits his children. Missing from this condemnation of the indigenous culture is the life-sustaining spirituality among the Mexican people against all the adversity they face, including this travesty against the Mexican spirit that is “Roma”.",conspiracy,C0718a,pizzagate

 February 20, 2017

 The battle to take down the Khazarian mafia is intensifying and reaching the point where the arrests of just a few dozen ring leaders may be enough to liberate humanity from this Satan worshiping scourge. 

 Years of forensic research and testimony from multiple intelligence agency sources in Russia, Japan, China, the US, England, France etc. have now zeroed in on key ringleaders of the Khazarian mafia who need to be arrested or executed.

 Before naming names though, first of all we need to clearly identify the overall target. That is a sub-set of the so-called Jewish population that is described in the Book of Ruth in the Old Testament or Torah. These are people who worship Satan (Baal, Molech etc.) and practice both human sacrifice and cannibalism. They have thousands of years’ experience in infiltrating societies and taking secret control of the top levels of power through murder, blackmail, bribery and propaganda. The nightmare of their rule is finally ending.

 However, make no mistake, these people are extremely dangerous, very smart and now literally fighting for their lives. The reason is they know that when the American people find out these thugs have been torturing and killing their children on an industrial scale, the people will demand justice be served, That’s why the battle taking place now inside the Washington DC power structure is so vicious.

 This Satanic faction created ISIS in order to convince Westerners to hate Islam enough to support a military invasion of Iran. The plan was to steal that nation’s oil, consolidate their control of the Middle East, and set up a world government with its headquarters in Jerusalem, the capital of their planned greater Babylon. This faction includes both Satan worshipping Jews and their brainwashed Christian Zionist servants. If this seems far-fetched, then ask yourself why 4000 world leaders from 130 countries are gathering in front of an Arch of Baal to discuss creating a world government?

The group that is fighting against them wants world peace, democracy, meritocracy, respect for law and human rights and friendly relations between all nations. They also want to free the world from the murderous rule of the Satan worshipping Khazarian mafia.

 The head of the Satan worshipping faction in the US is, according to certain royal family members is

 Lewis M. Eisenberg, Donald Trump’s selection for US Ambassador to Italy. No doubt while in Italy, Eisenberg was planning to conspire with other senior Satanists (according to CIA and NSA sources) such as the Agnelli Brothers, Victor Emmanuel, Leo Zagami and others against Pope Francis. Leo Zagami, by the way, once told me he had eaten a human fetus.

 Eisenberg has also been traced forensically by Japanese military intelligence to Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, through a cement conglomerate controlled by the French Branch of the Rothschild family. Japanese underworld sources say Aso is about to be publicly executed because he has begun selling Japanese publicly owned water resources to Rothschild controlled companies. Water is essential to life and stealing it from the Japanese people in exchange for bribes is not going to be forgiven, the underworld sources say.

 US intelligence sources, for their part, say that Eisenberg is blackmailing Donald Trump with a video of him having sex with a 13 year old girl.

That is why Trump had US director of National Intelligence General Michael Flynn fired when Flynn was about to start arresting senior pedophiles in the US power structure, these sources say. That is also why Trump is trying to place Steve Feinberg, head of the mercenary company DynCorp, in charge of the US military and intelligence apparatus.

It is also this blackmail that is preventing the Trump administration from prosecuting the perpetrators of mass murder incidents like 911 and Fukushima, the sources say.

 At the time of this writing, we were unable to contact Mr. Eisenberg for comment about these allegations but we will continue to make efforts to do so.

 In any case, the arrest of over 1000 low ranking members of pedophile networks in the US, Canada, Norway, Ghana etc. (many of them connected to the Clinton Foundation), is being used to gather evidence against higher level pedophiles, FBI and CIA sources say.

My advice to US mid to low ranking law enforcement authorities on how to go after the big fish needs to start with a look at Pedophilia. Pedophilia in legal terms can refer to anything from a 16 year old boy having sex with his 15 year old girlfriend to a middle aged man raping and strangling a 2 year old boy (a case my mother, who is a child psychologist, actually dealt with). Also bear in mind that traditional societies around the world and historically often used the puberty, especially menstruation in girls, as a sign people were of marriageable age. With this in mind, and in order to get evidence against the hard core child rapists and killers, authorities may have to consider offering immunity in exchange for testimony to billionaires who are being blackmailed with videos of them having sex with post-pubescent boys or girls.

 The anti-pedophile campaign is being led by true Christians, such as Pope Francis, Queen Elizabeth and Patriarch Kirill along with white knights inside the military and the agencies. It is this Christian alliance that is behind moves to coordinate Russian, American and European white hats to remove the Satanists.

 That is why US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the G20 in Germany last week, Pentagon sources say. Also, US top General Joseph Dunford met Russian military chief Valery Gerasimov in Baku on February 16 “to discuss the final takedown of ISIS, drug cartels, and the cabal,” the Pentagon sources say.

 Dunford also met with Azeri

top brass to stop Israeli covert operations in the Middle East, the sources say.

 Inside the US Department of Homeland Security Chief John Kelly is considering mobilizing 100,000 National Guard Troops to “deport illegals and then take on the cabal and the drug cartels,” the Pentagon sources add.

 This impending effort against the cabal and the drug cartels is probably why Bill Gates made veiled threats to kill millions of people with bio-weapons last week.

The fact is, the cabal has been trying, and failing, to create a pandemic for years and will continue to fail. So, if the US authorities want to go ahead and arrest Gates, there is no need to fear. They can also go ahead with their investigation of toxic vaccines and other malevolent parts of the pharmacidical industry.

 The Nazis contacted the White Dragon Society last week to say they were not behind the pandemic attacks. Here is what one of them said:

 “The old Nazis that escaped to South America, all of them have died out in the late 1990s. Many lived into their 90s and were very strong and these ones died of old age. The secret base in the mountains of South America was replenished with young Nazis males in their 30’s at the time. These new Nazis are not like the old Nazis. The new Nazis are not looking to take-over the world. They are reclusive, and so they stay to themselves and continue to work on and fly around the Earth in their saucer ships, etc.”

 The source also says the winner of the ongoing battle for world power will be decided by 2020. He also hinted the Nazis would share their technology with the world, once the dust settles down. In addition to anti-gravity and cloning technology, the Nazis also have stem cell technology that could cure many diseases etc, he says.

 The WDS was also contacted by the gnostic illuminati last week with a message about North Korea. They say Kim Jon Un’s half-brother Kim Jong Nam was killed last week because the Chinese were planning to use him to take over North Korea. This killing, combined with the shooting of a missile that went 550 kilometers up, was a message to the Chinese to stay out of North Korea, the illuminati source said. He said the North Koreans now had to capability to send a nuclear missile anywhere on earth and that if the Chinese invaded North Korea then “Beijing would be evaporated.” The overall message was “leave us alone.”

 Japanese military intelligence, for their part, say this is all part of a proxy war over North Korea between the US and China. A North Korean delegation will be visiting the US soon and unification of the Korean Peninsula with Kim as Emperor would be discussed, the sources said.

 The Japanese sources are also saying the Japanese imperial family is opposed to the regime of Shinzo Abe and that secret meetings were being held to discuss how to remove that regime before it completely loots Japan on behalf of the Khazarian mafia.

1186,"After more than 10 years of mystery Cesc Fabregas finally admitted to being the man who threw a slice of pizza at Sir Alex Ferguson.

The famous incident occurred following Manchester United's 2-0 2004 victory over Arsenal.

Fergie's side had just put an end to Arsene Wenger's 49-game unbeaten streak and tempers flared in the tunnel.

""I heard noises and I thought what's happening?"" said Fabregas on Thursday's episode of A League of Their Own. ""So I go out with my slice of pizza and I saw Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, Martin Keown... everyone pushing each other.

""I was like I want to get in but I don't know how to and I threw, just threw it. Once I saw it was hitting, like, who it was hitting, which I didn't mean…""

Fabregas added that he had also seen Keown ""punching people"" during the chaos.

However, the former Gunners defender has come out and disputed those claims.

Keown told MailOnline: ""Sorry Cesc, I wasn’t at Old Trafford when you flung the pizza at Sir Alex Ferguson... but I wish I had been!""

The ex-England star had already left Arsenal for Leicester.

Keown addded: ""In the 801 games I played for club and country I only saw punches thrown in the tunnel on two or three occasions — and one of them was during a game between Arsenal and United.

""But when I look back, there was always a level of respect between us. United beat us in the FA Cup semi-final in 2004, six months after I had clashed with Ruud van Nistelrooy at Old Trafford.""

1043,"In the waning days of 2016, liberal late-night hosts took to meeting with their counterparts in the conservative entertainment complex. “The Daily Show’s” Trevor Noah argued with The Blaze’s Tomi Lahren about the nature of race in America; “Full Frontal’s” Samantha Bee interviewed right-wing radio host Glenn Beck for a summit on “nonpartisan decency.” The power of these segments, supposedly, was the reconciliation of unlikely opposites. But how opposite have these two groups really been? The post-truth condition, in which Trumpism has flourished, has its roots in left-wing satire.

2016 was the year when the line between parody and reality blurred to the point of vanishing. Fake news spread through social media as swiftly as it did thoroughly. By the end of October, a PPP poll found that 40 percent of Donald Trump supporters in Florida thought Hillary Clinton was “an actual demon” — who could make up anything crazier than that? Post-fact life is funny but not ha-ha funny. Everything has become a joke and so nothing is anymore.

But satire swallowed the news first. The point of origin was probably Jon Stewart’s legendary appearance on “Crossfire” in 2004, in which he claimed that the high-volume political debate program was existentially evil rather than in error: “It’s not so much that it’s bad, as it’s hurting America.” When the hosts brought up Stewart’s softball questioning of political figures, he used satire as an alibi. “My point is this,” Stewart said. “If your idea of confronting me is that I don’t ask hard-hitting enough news questions, we’re in bad shape, fellows.”

Stewart put himself in an ideal position — he was moral arbiter who could determine what was hurting America while he took no responsibility himself. He knew better than journalists but he was not subject to their rules. He was just an entertainer.

But he wasn’t. While “Crossfire” soon died, “The Daily Show” went on to become as regular a source for news as USA Today. In 2009, a Time magazine poll declared Stewart the most trusted news anchor on the air. “The Daily Show,” and those who emerged from it, indulged a contempt for real media institutions while effectively competing with them. In 2010, Stewart led the Rally to Restore Sanity in Washington — an overtly political act.

The comedy-politics confusion isn’t unique to the United States. Beppe Grillo began as a political satirist and now leads the Five Star Movement in Italy. In 2013, the Five Star Movement, which sits with the United Kingdom Independence Party in the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group in the European Parliament, was the second most popular party in the Italian Chamber of Deputies.

Real power brings with it the problems satirists love to mock, though: In December, the Five Star Movement had to disown Virginia Raggi, the mayor of Rome, when one of her advisors was arrested for alleged corruption.

In one sense, of course, political satire is the opposite of fake news. Satirists rip away the pretenses of journalism to reveal what they believe to be true. Fake news sites use the pretenses of journalism to spread what they know to be false.

Despite intentions, however, the effect is the same. Political satirists, and their audiences, have turned the news itself into a joke. No matter what the content of their politics, they have contributed to the post-factual state of American political discourse. It doesn’t matter what Sam Bee or John Oliver say; it matters that their comedy is the source for political information.

Satire, like fake news, creates a sense of community through rejection. It delights in tearing down institutions but is useless at constructing them. Jonathan Swift said that satire was a mirror in which viewers discovered everybody’s face but their own; its pleasure is the pleasure of othering.

The act is inherently tribal as well as political, and social media exacerbates the tribalism.

Left-wing friends eagerly post John Oliver’s latest screed with THIS in all caps, hoping for mutual virtue-signaling. Right-wing friends post pizzagate fantasies to prove how deep their anger runs. The actual content is more or less irrelevant — at least beyond which side is the object of derision. In a recent survey by Pew Research, 14 percent of respondents admitted that they intentionally shared fake news. The left and the right in America are in a contest of competitive virality: comic bits vs. fake news.

In 2016, the power of outraged mockery was vastly greater than the power of informed debate. But the immediate crisis of American political satire in the Trump era is more basic. It’s simple, really: Trump benefits from being satirized.

The greatest modern expression of American satire, Spy magazine, mocked Trump for its entire run. (Spy teased Trump for having small hands long before Marco Rubio did.) Their contempt only aided his manic self-promotion. The same is unquestionably true for the current Trump parodies on “Saturday Night Live.” In the New York Times, Alec Baldwin acknowledged that his performances of Trump run the risk of humanizing him. If only that were nothing more than a risk.

Parodying Trump is at best a distraction from his real politics; at worst it converts the whole of politics into a gag. The process has nothing to do with the performers or the writers or their choices. Trump built his candidacy on performing as a comic heel — that has been his pop culture persona for decades. It is simply not possible to parody effectively a man who is a conscious self-parody, and who has become president of the United States on the basis of that performance.

Where does this state of affairs put comedians now? On one side are the engaged comics, like Bee and Oliver, who are becoming increasingly indistinguishable from straight political commentators, shouting their arguments with an occasional comic aside. Ironically, they look and feel increasingly like a liberal version of “Crossfire.” On the other side are the comedians of retreat, Jimmy Fallon chuckling over lip-syncing celebrities and carpool karaoke with James Corden.

Trump wins either way. He wins if he’s a punch line and he wins if he’s ignored. That’s what you get when you elect a walking, talking joke.

1220,"Prior political beliefs and the tendency for conspiracist ideation appear particularly important for individuals' endorsement of FN, regardless of prior exposure to the specific news presented. As such, conspiracy theory (CT) belief and its underlying mechanisms appear a useful starting point in identifying some of the underlying individual difference variables involved in conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial FN belief. Implications and limitations are discussed.

Political viewpoint was a consistent predictor of FN endorsement. Conspiratorial worldview and schizotypal personality also predicted FN belief, with weaker or less consistent prediction by other variables including dangerous worldview, normlessness, and randomness beliefs. Partial correlation analysis suggested that most variables related to FN through their association with conspiracist ideation and political identity beliefs.

Politically‐slanted fake news (FN)—manufactured disinformation, hoaxes, and satire appearing to present true information about events—is currently receiving extensive attention in the mainstream media. However, it is currently unclear what factors may influence an individual's likelihood to believe in FN, outside of political identity. As FN is often conspiratorial in nature and usually negative, it was theorised that conspiracist belief, and factors that have been found to relate to a conspiratorial worldview (i.e., dangerous worldview and schizotypy), may also relate to political FN.

The phenomenon of “fake news” in the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign received widespread attention in the mainstream media. Some commentators even suggested—in the immediate aftermath of the result—that it had influenced the outcome of the election itself (Parkinson, 2016; Read, 2016). Fake news (FN) refers to manufactured disinformation, hoaxes, and satire appearing to present true information about events, which are spread primarily via social media (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017; Macquarie Dictionary online, n.d.). Relationships between FN and behaviour are yet to be reported scientifically, but there is concern about the influence of FN—particularly politically‐relevant FN—and what can be done to counter it (see Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017; Hunt, 2016; Wendling, 2017). Politically slanted FN content is usually negative, with numerous stories damaging to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton circulating online prior to the 2016 election (see www.snopes.com, for examples). The content of FN often has a conspiratorial aspect: the belief that the explanation for events (or their concealment) is that powerful forces are secretly at work to realise their sinister plans (cf. Swami, Chamorro‐Premuzic, & Furnham, 2010; Zonis & Joseph, 1994). For example, in the week before the election a story dubbed “Pizzagate,” began to circulate, since assessed as being false (La Capria, 2016). It alleged that hacked emails from former Clinton presidential campaign manager, John Podesta, revealed a conspiracy whereby a secret paedophile ring was operating out of a pizza restaurant in the Washington DC that had hosted Clinton‐related events (La Capria, 2016). Given the similarity of much FN to conspiracist ideation, and the larger existing literature on why people believe in conspiracy theories (CTs), in this study we wished to examine whether CT belief, and factors linked in recent studies to CT belief, were a factor underlying FN belief, particularly FN with a conspiratorial bent.

In the literature on the psychology of CTs, a popular notion is the idea of conspiracist ideation or a conspiracist mentality: people who believe in one CT tend to believe in more than one (Moscovici, 1987; Swami et al., 2011). Goertzel (1994) noted that more than 80% of respondents in his study believed that at least two or more CTs from a list of 10 were definitely or probably true. He attributed this tendency to a “monological belief system” (p. 740), wherein belief in one CT becomes a source of evidence for other CTs, enhancing the likelihood of belief in new CTs (see also Imhoff & Bruder, 2013; Moulding et al., 2016; Swami et al., 2010, 2011; Wood, Douglas, & Sutton, 2012). Further, Swami et al. (2011) found, in an Austrian sample (N = 281), that belief in CTs was even predictive of belief in fictional CTs created by the research team. While a range of variables have been found to be implicated in conspiracist belief, perhaps the most consistent findings involve the conceptually related factors comprising a “dangerous worldview” (e.g., Abalakina‐Paap, Stephan, Craig, & Gregory, 1999). These factors include low levels of trust and greater powerlessness, social isolation, and alienation/anomie (Abalakina‐Paap et al., 1999; Goertzel, 1994; Moulding et al., 2016). Moulding et al. (2016) describe the relationship of CT belief with dangerous worldview‐related factors as the “coping‐with‐alienation‐and‐powerlessness” (p. 346) explanation of CT belief. Consistent with this characterisation, and as observed by Abalakina‐Paap et al. (1999), such people reject both official and conventional explanations for what is going on in the world. Instead, CTs provide an alternative explanation of both salient events and ultimately the individual's own circumstances: the world is a bad place, full of bad people plotting for personal gain (Moulding et al., 2016). Belief in conspiratorial FN may work in a similar way, wherein the individual's relative disenfranchisement and disadvantage can be explained in their own mind by the belief that powerful elites are actively cooperating in, or choosing to ignore, malevolent wrong‐doing. Therefore, it is plausible that dangerous worldview‐related factors are associated not only with belief in CTs, but also with belief in conspiratorial FN. Recent research has also noted that schizotypal personality traits are a robust predictor of CT belief—consisting of odd and unusual beliefs, suspicion, magical thinking, perceptual distortions, and paranoia (Barron, Morgan, Towell, Altemeyer, & Swami, 2014; Barron et al., 2018; Bruder, Haffke, Neave, Nouripanah, & Imhoff, 2013; Darwin, Neave, & Holmes, 2011; Swami et al., 2013). For example, Barron et al. (2014) found that schizotypal beliefs, and particularly the odd beliefs and magical thinking subscale, were strong predictors of CT beliefs in a large questionnaire study. Darwin et al. (2011) suggested it was particularly the tendency to suspicion that linked schizotypy and CT belief. More recently, Barron et al. (2018) found using questionnaires that a decrease in analytic thinking partially mediated between the link between schizotypal symptoms and CT belief, among other factors (cf. Moulding et al., 2016). Regardless of the exact mechanism (i.e., reasoning or world‐view), these studies provide evidence to suggest a relationship between schizotypal traits and beliefs in CTs, and by extension to conspiratorial FN. Finally, examining belief in FN in the context of the 2016 U.S. presidential election demands some consideration of the role of political identity. The CT literature suggests that there is generally no significant difference between left‐wing liberals and right‐wing conservatives as to who is more inclined to a conspiracist mentality (Edelson, Alduncin, Krewson, Sieja, & Uscinski, 2017; Goertzel, 1994; Oliver & Wood, 2014). However, belief in specific CTs is differentiated by political or socio‐political persuasion (Oliver & Wood, 2014; Uscinski, Klofstad, & Atkinson, 2016). In short, Republicans are more likely to believe the CT that President Obama was not born in the United States (Oliver & Wood, 2014), while Democrats are more likely to believe that President Bush was complicit in the September 11 attacks (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017). Allcott and Gentzkow (2017) found that Democrats and Republicans are more likely to believe politically congruent FN stories than neutral ones. Building on these findings, it seems likely that Democrats and Republicans are more likely to believe politically congruent—and disbelieve politically incongruent—conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial FN. The aim of this study was to test whether CT beliefs, political identity, and factors previously shown to be involved in CT belief are also involved in belief in conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial FN, using a questionnaire design in a sample of U.S. participants. It was predicted that conspiracist ideation would be positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN, and that political identity would be positively related to belief in FN about the opposite party's candidate and negatively correlated with belief in conspiratorial FN about one's own candidate. It was hypothesised that schizotypy, dangerous worldview, randomness, and alienation would be positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN, and that perceived benevolence of the world would be negatively related to belief in conspiratorial FN. While there are reasonable theoretical grounds to believe these hypotheses are true for conspiratorial FN, hypotheses will also be tested for relationships with non‐conspiratorial FN. Finally, to control for whether it is just a factor of exposure to the specific FN via the media, we also examined whether entirely fictitious conspiratorial FN invented for this study had similar correlates.

There was no missing data. Scales had acceptable reliability, except for the belief in non‐conspiratorial FN about Trump subscale, which was marginal (α = 0.65; see Table 1). Consistent with the overall voting history, the sample was somewhat left‐leaning, but there was suitable range for analysis. Correlational analyses suggested that the three political variables correlated with the news types for all candidates, with the PIS significantly correlating with all types of news, whereas the LRS and LAS correlated with four of the six types, with correlations in the expected directions. Conspiratorial ideation related positively to all types of FN excepting non‐conspiratorial FN regarding Trump, while the OLIFE related to all types excepting FN for Trump and entirely‐fictitious FN for Clinton, the latter of which just missed significance. Of the worldview variables, the DWS and DAS‐Norm related positively to four of the six news types, while the WAS‐Randomness related negatively to FN and entirely factiously fake news (EFN) regarding Trump, and positively to conspiratorial FN regarding Clinton. The other variables did not relate to FN endorsement. As we were interested in whether the variables related above‐and‐beyond conspiratorial ideation, and above‐and‐beyond political identity, partial correlations were performed controlling separately for these variables (Table 2). Only variables that were initially significant for at least some types of FN were considered for analysis. Generally, when controlling for political identity, the Left–Right Scale and Libertarian–Authoritarian Scale was reduced in their strength of correlation, though the LAS remained significant for some variables consistent with it measuring a wider construct than the political identity scale. Interestingly, the WAS‐Randomness only remained significant for one variable (FN‐Trump), and the Dangerous Wordview Scale was also reduced in many of its correlations, while DAS‐Normlessness, the BCTI and OLIFE were largely unaffected, when controlling for political identity. In contrast, controlling for conspiratorial worldview did not affect the general pattern of correlations of FN with political variables or WAS‐Randomness, but did largely reduce correlations with the OLIFE and DAS‐Normlessness, and the DWS. Correlations for prediction of various FN types

The aim of this study was to test whether factors previously shown to be involved in CT belief are also involved in belief in conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial political FN. It was hypothesised that conspiracist ideation would be positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN. This hypothesis was supported. It was hypothesised that schizotypy, dangerous worldview, randomness, and alienation would be positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN and benevolence would be negatively related to belief in conspiratorial FN. There was partial support for this hypothesis. The final hypothesis was that political identity and political views would be positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN about the opposite party's candidate and negatively correlated with belief in conspiratorial FN about one's own candidate. Again, this hypothesis was supported. As was anticipated, based on research by Allcott and Gentzkow (2017), political identity was related to belief in conspiratorial FN that is congruent with one's political viewpoint. Similarly, more general left–right and libertarian–authoritarian views were related to belief in FN, excepting the two conspiratorial categories regarding Trump. That these predictive relationships exist is unsurprising, but it is important that this is now established empirically. That political identity predicted belief in FN could be attributable to a phenomenon known as motivated reasoning, or motivated partisan reasoning. In motivated reasoning, people have been found to process information in a way that protects or enhances their current belief system (even in the face of contradictory information; Miller, Saunders, & Farhart, 2015). Motivated partisan reasoning happens when people judge information about their ingroup more positively and information about the outgroup more negatively (Claassen & Ensley, 2016; Edelson et al., 2017). There is a significant body of evidence to suggest that motivated reasoning elicits differences in how people process information on topics ranging from American football to political campaigning “dirty tricks” (Carey, Nyhan, Valentino, & Liu, 2016; Claassen & Ensley, 2016). Indeed, Edelson et al. (2017) found that conspiratorial thinking and motivated partisan reasoning were both predictors of belief in electoral fraud in the United States. Research directly investigating whether political identity influences FN through such mechanisms may be an important branch of future work. Turning to conspiracist ideation, general conspiratorial thinking related to belief in conspiratorial FN (both for in‐circulation FN and fictious FN invented for this study), and indeed also predicted non‐conspiracist FN regarding Clinton. This would suggest that Goertzel's “monological belief system” may also be at work in belief in FN regardless of whether such news stories are novel or in‐circulation (cf. Moulding et al., 2016; Swami et al., 2011). Based on suggestions that conspiratorial worldview may be related to FN belief, we also examined factors that have been found to predict CT more generally in whether they linked to FN. Consistent with its relationship to the conspiratorial worldview (e.g., Darwin et al., 2011), we found that schizotypy also positively predicted all types of political FN barring non‐conspiratorial FN for Trump. These findings were largely—albeit not completely—removed when controlling for conspiratorial worldview, but not when controlling political views. Similar but less strong or less consistent relationships were found with dangerous worldview, which were again removed when controlling for conspiracism, and to a lesser extent by political identity. Randomness was positively related to belief in conspiratorial FN about Clinton, and negatively with belief in FN about Trump and fictitious FN regarding Trump. The relationship between randomness and the FN variables was largely ameliorated when controlling for political identity but not conspiracism. This suggests that the relationship between randomness and FN was due to associations with political identity rather than conspiracism; indeed, in contrast to the findings of Moulding et al. (2016), randomness was not related to conspiracist ideation generally. The opposing findings indicate that people who see hidden order in society are more likely to endorse Clinton conspiratorial FN, whereas those who believe that societal events are more chaotic are more likely to endorse Trump FN. While benevolence and alienation were related to conspiracist ideation generally, only normlessness predicted FN, with small relationships with the FN variables excepting non‐conspiratorial Trump FN, while the relationships with conspiratorial FN regarding Clinton just missed significance. These relationships were largely removed when controlling for conspiracism but not political identity. Overall, then, we found that political identity and conspiracism were strong and important predictors of political FN, with only the relationship between non‐conspiratorial FN regarding Trump and conspiracist thinking missing significance. It was a little surprising that the non‐conspiratorial FN regarding Clinton was predicted by conspiracism; however, examination of the items indicated that the non‐conspiratorial Clinton items also implied a level of public–private duplicity that could perhaps be consistent with a conspiratorial viewpoint even if they are not strictly conspiratorial by definition. Overall, it appears that some of the worldview variables are important factors, but that these may operate through their association with political identity (in the case of left–right views, randomness, and to some extent dangerous worldview), or with conspiracism (particularly for schizotypy, normlessness, and to a greater extent, dangerous worldview). Generally, significant relationships between the independent variables and conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial FN about Clinton seemed of a stronger effect size than the independent variable relationships with belief in conspiratorial FN about Trump. Indeed, there is a small body of evidence to suggest that at the present time, Republicans may indeed be more likely to believe or have stronger belief in FN than Democrats. Allcott and Gentzkow (2017) found that FN favouring Trump both out‐numbered and was out‐shared on Facebook compared to FN favouring Clinton, by factors of three‐to‐one and four‐to‐one respectively (although they note that sharing a story is not the same as believing it; indeed, it may not be the same as even reading it). They speculate that one possible explanation for this is that Republicans are more inclined to believe FN. Interestingly, they cite evidence (McClosky & Chong, 1985; Uscinski et al., 2016) of non‐partisanship in a predisposition to conspiratorial thinking as evidence against this hypothesis. Pennycook and Rand (2017) found Clinton supporters were better able to discern fake from real news than were Trump supporters in their recent study (N = 800), where participants were asked to judge the accuracy of news headlines presented in “Facebook” format. In summary, there are potential between‐group differences based on political identity regarding belief in FN that merit further investigation. However, we wish to strongly note that as we did not have any a priori hypotheses regarding these specific differences, such findings should be viewed as post hoc, and should be taken with great caution unless replicated. There were limitations in this study. Participants were predominantly young and more left‐wing than the average voter, and so generalisation may be questioned. Reported voting (87%) was higher than the national average (estimated by McDonald, 2016 at around 60%), suggesting participants were more politically engaged than would be typical. The study is correlational in nature and thus causation cannot be inferred. The subscale measuring belief in non‐conspiratorial FN about Trump had only marginal reliability, which may have lowered power. We also did not ask participants if they had been exposed to the specific FN stories, which may have played a role in the findings; while the findings with entirely fabricated FN argue against a mere exposure effect, these were lower than for the other categories of FN generally. It may be useful to gauge this in future studies, although care should be taken that the exposure measure does not simply become a proxy measure of believability (i.e., people could tend to believe they have seen stories they endorse before, regardless of actual exposure). Finally, while politically slanted FN appears to be generating the most concern in current society, it would be of interest to see if these results also generalise to more general FN (particularly those linked to CT beliefs). In conclusion, the community is justifiably concerned about the rise of FN and particularly political FN, since—at the very least—people who consume and believe FN are at heightened risk of holding inaccurate beliefs about the world (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017). This preliminary investigation expands our understanding of political FN by demonstrating that CT belief is a useful starting point in identifying some of the underlying individual difference variables involved in conspiratorial and non‐conspiratorial FN belief. Future experimental and mechanism‐based studies can further this research into this important aspect of modern society.",mainstream,M1f97c,pizzagate
429,"Washington, DC - Counterprotesters outnumbered members of the far-right Proud Boys group and their supporters at a Saturday rally that took place a few blocks from the White House in Washington, DC. Despite a large police presence and a few minor scuffles between the opposing camps, no major outbreaks of violence took place.

Held in the United States capital's Freedom Plaza, the ""Demand Free Speech"" rally organised by the Proud Boys brought around 200 people together to denounce what they perceive as anti-conservative bias on the part of major social media companies.

The Proud Boys are a self-described pro-Western, chauvinist ""fraternity"" who has been classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group.

Separated from the far-right rally by heavy metal barricades and police, hundreds of counterprotesters - largely DC residents, in contrast with their far-right counterparts - held a rally of their own in the adjacent Pershing Park.

""I'm a native Washingtonian, and what we're not going to do is allow the alt-right or the Proud Boys or the right wing to come to our city and amplify hate, bigotry and racism,"" said NeeNee Taylor, the direct action captain for Black Lives Matter DC. ""White supremacy is not going to be allowed here in DC. Defending free speech is not killing someone in Charlottesville.""

Organised by All Out DC, an activist collective, the counterprotest response to the far-right rally across the street highlighted the struggles of people with marginalised identities including immigrants, Native Americans and trans women of colour with speeches, chants and performances by local artists.

""The people holding the free speech rally were kicked off social media for bigotry,"" said counterprotester and All Out DC member Laura Crain. ""They are weaponising the concept of free speech and we oppose the hateful, bigoted rhetoric they espouse.""

""This is how you shut down Nazis,"" said counterprotester and DC resident Rachel Gregory. ""They don't go away when you ignore them. As a white person, I can pass anywhere. That's why I need to use that privilege,"" she said.

On the other side of the barricades, rally attendees listened to speeches from far-right media personalities, who talked about how they have been affected by social media bans and outlined strategies for fighting the left in the US. Although speakers at the Demand Free Speech rally frequently railed against the ""violence"" they feared from leftist protesters, the rhetoric they employed often referred to using violence and the need to remain aggressive in the face of left-wing activists.

""The left must be made to fear you…[with] massive brutal retaliation for the slightest of perceived insults,"" disgraced writer and former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos told an audience of about 200 people.

Far-right political commentator and founder of the Proud Boys Gavin McInnes took the stage to predict the re-election of President Donald Trump and disparage his ideological opponents. ""They can't fight, they can't argue, they can't even get a job,"" said McInnes, who has since left the Proud Boys. ""They can't arrest us all. Let's fight. Let's step into the fray.""

Asked exactly what kind of speech was unfairly censored online and off, event organiser David Sumrall of Houston, Texas, claimed that Laura Loomer - a far-right provocateur who was banned from Twitter after tweeting Islamophobic falsehoods about US representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali refugee and one of two Muslim women elected to Congress - ""lost her voice"" for ""talking down on sharia [Islamic] law"".

Other right-wing personalities who had been advertised as speakers, including former Trump adviser Roger Stone and Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich, failed to turn up.

Flamboyant rhetoric aside, only a few minor scuffles took place between rally attendees and counterprotesters, owing in large part to the distance created between the groups by police barricades that made it difficult for either group to hear insults lobbed from one side or another.

The relative peace of the day's events stood in contrast with some confrontations that took place last weekend in Portland, Oregon.

Earlier in the week, the Proud Boys had been involved in a violent confrontation of their own, when they fought with members of a communist group that was burning American flags in front of the White House on July 4.

Whatever their affiliation, the one point of agreement between many of the counterprotesters and far-right rally attendees concerned the ideological affinities of the police.

""They really have our backs on this,"" said Sumrall. ""Police are here to support and protect us.""

Metropolitan Police Department chief Peter Newsham said last week that extra officers would be present for the duelling protests.

""This is not out of the ordinary here in Washington, DC, so we'll be ready for it,"" he said.

Video that emerged earlier in the week showing a DC police officer fist-bumping a Proud Boy on the fourth of July after their altercation in front of the White House did little to dispel that impression among attendees of the far-right rally or the counterprotesters.

""Proud Boys are just a sliver,"" said Nelson Dolores Lopez, a member of the activist collective La Colectiva as he addressed counterprotesters in Pershing Park. Referring to the police guarding the barricades surrounding the far-right rally, he added: ""The other Proud Boys are over there.""",mainstream,M13852,pizzagate
1066,"Today’s thread is going to take us further down the rabbit hole

I think it’s time for us to explore: #HumanCloning

I ask that you set aside your preconceived notions and #KeepYourMindOpen

I will let you know when it’s the end of thread so please don’t unroll until I say it’s done.

“Human cloning is the creation of a genetically identical copy (or clone) of a human. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissue.”

There are different ways to do this.

I will not go into the details of the science. But there are some important topics we can touch on here.

Human cloning has been going on for some time. (WAY longer than u can imagine) This is nothing new, just hidden.

This Time cover is from 2002.

How do they do it?

It’s a replication of your DNA in a controlled environment. There is some genetic manipulation required. If you have someone’s DNA you can make an exact replica of them.

Stem cells are NOT what I’m talking about here.

From a single person, you can literally grow an exact replica. You do not need an egg and a sperm nor do you need a host to have a baby.

We are talking straight up petrie dish, humans in vats technology.

Been going on in Asia for years.

Also here in the US.

Here is an excerpt from my thread about #RayChandler and why #CabalControlled dentists are such a key players in the #HumanCloning going on in Hollywood. Read the insanity

Mind blowing all of it

Clones are used for bad and for good. Humans gained this knowledge through alien reversed tech.

We can grow a human in less than one hour with the most advanced tech. It used to take longer. Depends on what you have access to.

Many layers to this uncovered reality (why we are all here – to learn and spread the truth).

✓ Remember what Q says: “How must people be made aware of an alternate reality?”

You can’t just come out and tell everyone everything at once. No way. Not everyone can take that much reality in one sitting.

How do you eat an elephant?

A big data dump would put most people in the hospital…

Hollywood will be their biggest downfall. They have put this out in front of our face this entire time. Many celebs are cloned (by the use of their teeth or other bodily material collected by caballed doctors on the Luciferian payroll).

Clones are profitable for the cabal in various ways. Imagine have ten Scarlett’s (who is also a transgender – no proof yet, but many of us in HW know – wait for it – it WILL come out). They often kill the real one and literally remote (mind) control the clones. WHY?..

Many reasons, mostly profit & protect their evil agendas. When a clone replaces the original, copyrights are stolen by the cabal and royalties are kept from the original. $$$ Many musicians take the cabal’s deal, and are offed when non cooperative.

Many movies have been talking about this and been right in front of our face for YEARS!

WATCH STARMAN. It says it ALL

Click here for an excerpt thread that will blow your mind

A nice little hint that Q used this image for one of their drops

Here is a link to the cloning scene

Which begs the question: Can they clone and recreate a dinosaur? …

The answer is: YES Yes, they can make anything with a DNA sample from even a fossil. This is the truth.

A human can be cloned from a single HAIR Of course, there are MANY moral dilemmas that face us in this #GameOfClones

But Im not going into those here. (ctd. )

Human organs and body parts can also be cloned using the same process & technology. So you see how this can go both ways: Ying and Yang Good v. Evil We will never eradicate that fight. But we can make decisions as #WeThePeople Many are waiting for life saving organs.

We have all lost someone to organ failure, cancer, accidents, you name it. Imagine a world where you can check into a hospital and literally get a new anything to replace the old everything. Say goodbye to big pharma and cabal created diseases.

Many layers of truth by the genius Q team. Since we already HAVE this tech and are just not using it (cabal), maybe this is why Q says, if everyone knew the truth, they would all run to the hospital. Maybe they are alluding to all this stuff we cannot access.. YET

Recently, I attended a talk where @emerysmith33 presented amazing tech that would extend human life by decades. Emery is a medical expert and has a unique background in this field. Give him a follow. He’s the real deal. God bless this brave man and protect him from harm.

I agree with cloning body parts & saving lives I do not agree with cloning people. But that is just my opinion. I can see how it can be used for good as well. But again, these decisions are not for me to make. Just laying out some thoughts here. Don’t shoot the messenger.

What if this whole “show” involves clones? It’s possible. What if what we are watching is really not what we are seeing? Think about that. What could that mean? Who is really real and who is really not? How can you tell a clone from the real deal? You can’t by sight.

How could you administer justice while maintaining public safety?

And then there is Ruth… #RGB How easy would it be to plop up a clone in this charade?

How do we know who we are seeing is the real deal? We don’t.

Like I said in the beginning, this is nothing new. Cloning has been around for a VERY long time.

Check out what Erik von Daniken has to say about all this. He’s a legend. This predates what we have been taught (wrong) in schools.

Where are these clones kept? Are they just out running around without supervision? What do you think?

Most are kept in remote facilities – either underground (think Sandia Labs and Dulce NM) where many of these HW clones are kept and bought out as needed.

The truth will not be for everyone. Even though it’s been put right in front of us this entire time, many will not be able to understand how we got here, and why this has been hidden for so long. #TheMoreYouKnow E.g., look at these HW movies:

Thank God for @POTUS and his team of intelligence that has been slowly leaking this info to us, so #WeThePeople can finally be freed of the centuries of the evil #LuciferianLies

God help us in this storm.

End of this thread. Thank you for your time. Please kindly share & RT. Knowledge is power.

This is not hard for me to believe. I am in the bucking bull industry and they were making clones almost 10 years ago. Several of the industry’s top bull athletes were cloned and in some cases there were 6-8 duplicates made.",conspiracy,C03067,alien; big.pharma; pizzagate
602,"To promote his new single “Yummy”, Justin Bieber posted strange pics of random babies with the hashtag “Yummy.” Also, there are lots of references to pizzas. Also, the “Yummy” music video has a hidden message.

What is going on with Justin Bieber?

Justin Bieber released a new single called Yummy and it seems to be custom made to piss people off. For starters, the song’s brain-numbing hook is somewhat infuriating in its own right. It’s like it was written for toddlers:

Yeah, you got that yummy-yum

 That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy

 Yeah, you got that yummy-yum

However, the verses make it clear that the actual subject of the song is very adult and very sexual.

A headline from Elite Daily about the song’s lyrics.

 Here’s an example of suggestive lyrics:

That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah

 Rollin’ eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah,

Standin’ up, keep me on the rise

 Lost control of myself, I’m compromised

 You’re incriminating, no disguise (No disguise)

 And you ain’t never runnin’ low on supplies

While Bieber is clearly not the first artist to release a pop song with sexual innuendo, the promotion surrounding the single makes things extremely weird and uncomfortable.

Whoever handler’s Bieber’s Instagram account decided it would be a good idea to post pictures of random babies with the hashtag “Yummy”.

Here are some examples:

Bieber’s IG account contains many more pictures of babies.

To make things even weirder, Bieber also posted the song’s title with pizza letters:

It is now a widely known fact that “pizza” is a code word used in pedophile circles. It even became a meme in internet forums such as 4Chan.

To those who understand the sick codes of these people, the combination of the song’s lyrics with pictures of babies and the word “Yummy” written in pizza letters is difficult to ignore.

Another widely known meme associated with these creeps is pedobear. Here’s another post on Bieber’s IG account in the midst of the Yummy promotional blitz:

To make things even stranger, the music video adds another layer of “what in hell?”

The music video takes place in a posh restaurant that is attended by posh-looking people. It’s the type of place people in the elite would go to.

At the beginning of the video, the camera lingers on children playing music:

The only children in the restaurant are the musicians. In other words, children are the “entertainment”.

While the children are playing, Bieber enjoys weird food with some weird-looking people:

Considering the subject matter of the song, one can easily interpret that this orgy of food is actually meant to represent an orgy of people. The close-ups of people suggestively eating food are not very subtle:

This older man is fed a strawberry by this older woman. Suggestive.

The final frame of the video explains what the food in the video actually represents. That frame is so symbolically important that it was also posted on Bieber’s Instagram account:

A cake is eaten and reveals the face of a very young Justin Bieber … with the word “Yummy” underneath.

The final frame basically says that the dishes represent children. They are being “tasted”. And Bieber is a victim of the very system he is celebrating in the video.

What is Happening With Bieber?

Some might wonder why Bieber is partaking in this is creepy and overt child-loving stuff while he could, like, not do it. The short answer is: He doesn’t have a choice.

Since the very beginning of his career, Bieber was always an industry pawn, with little or no control over his career. As the last frame of Yummy appears to say, Bieber himself might have been abused by creeps in the music industry.

Others wonder why Bieber – who is a devout and outspoken Christian – is partaking in this occult elite stuff. Indeed, there are lots of Jesus-related posts on his IG account (although weirdly mixed with creepy, Yummy-related pictures).

However, to get a better picture of what is happening here, we need to look at Bieber’s church: The powerful, star-studded Hillsong Church.

Hillsong Church went from a small local church in Australia to an “international movement”.

The Church is famously attended by various stars such as Selena Gomez, Kylie and Kendall Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens, Nick Jonas, Hailee Steinfeld, and Bono. All of them are pawns of the occult elite.

The founder of the church Brian Houston also has close ties with the political elite of Australia:

Hillsong Church has attracted support from high-profile politicians, especially from the Liberal Party of Australia. In 1998, Brian Houston met with then Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, and most of his Cabinet, at Parliament House in Canberra before sharing prayers.

In 2002, John Howard opened the Hillsong Convention Centre at the Baulkham Hills location. In 2004 and 2005, the then Treasurer of Australia, Peter Costello, spoke at its annual conferences. – Wikipedia, Hillsong Church

All of this elite endorsement happened despite the fact that the Church has a dark secret: The father of the Church’s founder Frank Houston admitted to abusing several young boys in Australia and New Zealand. And the leadership of the Church did everything possible to cover-up this sordid affair:

Frank Houston, the father of Hillsong Church founder Brian Houston, was a pastor in New Zealand and Australia who abused as many as nine boys over the course of his ministry. In the 1960s and ’70s, one victim was routinely subjected to sexual abuse from the age of 7 to 12.

In 1999, his mother reported the abuse to the church. Although Brian Houston was legally obligated to report the crime, he did not do so.

The victim later testified to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that Frank Houston offered him AU$10,000 as compensation at a McDonald’s in the presence of Hillsong Church elder Nabi Saleh.

During an internal church investigation, Frank Houston eventually confessed to the crime. The commission also heard that he was involved in the sexual abuse of other children in New Zealand.

Frank Houston resigned from his church in 2000, which then merged with Hillsong Church. Contrary to what is stated in Frank Houston’s resignation letter, he retired from the position of senior pastor of Sydney Christian Life Centre in May 1999 and was never employed by Hillsong Church.

A further internal investigation by Assemblies of God in Australia, in conjunction with the Assemblies of God in New Zealand, found six additional child sexual abuse allegations, which were regarded as credible.

In 2015, the royal commission examined allegations that accused Brian Houston of concealing his father’s crimes and censured him for failing to report his father to the police.

In November 2018, 60 Minutes aired a segment revisiting the sexual abuse scandal, because newly revealed documentation allegedly reveals that Brian Houston was deeply involved in a cover-up and that Frank Houston’s abusive behaviour was worse than initially thought.

Brian Houston allegedly used his position within the Assemblies of God in Australia denomination to conceal his father’s serial child sexual abuse.

The matter was referred to the New South Wales Police Force, which confirmed that Brian Houston was under criminal investigation for failing to report a serious crime. Following the 60 Minutes story, Hillsong released a statement in response to the allegations. – Ibid.

So, to circle back to the title of the article: Why did Justin Bieber tag babies “Yummy” on Instagram? Because he is a pawn of the entertainment industry which is controlled by some very sick people.

Since the beginning of his career, Bieber has been caught up in a never-ending whirlwind of strange, humiliating events and has often displayed bizarre behavior.

He’s always been a “whipping boy” of the industry and the face of crappy pop music.

With Yummy, the pattern continues. His handlers purposely turned Yummy into some kind of “child-lover” anthem by associating it with overt imagery and creepy Instagram posts.

In short, Bieber was used to push one of the elite’s favorite agendas: The normalization and the celebration of child abuse.",conspiracy,C01aab,pizzagate

237,"Comet Ping Pong, the Washington, D.C. pizzeria that internet hoaxers made famous as part of the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theory, was the alleged victim of arson on Thursday night, and investigators are searching for a suspect.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) sent out a tweet Friday night with a picture of a ""white male, 25 - 30 years old, with blonde hair, mustache and a beard"" saying that the man was ""wanted for questioning.""

According to the Washington Post, an unidentified patron set fire to a curtain in the back of Comet Ping Pong on Thursday evening. The fire was extinguished by staffers and no one was injured.

The 77-year-old is helping to land big ratings on Channel 4’s version of the cake show, with co-judge Paul Hollywood hosts Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding .

But, as she cooks up her new hit, she tells us: “I’m finishing a trilogy of novels. It starts in the war, and there’s love stories through three generations of the same family.

“My big ambition is for it to be the new Downton Abbey.

“I don’t want to be in it, I want to write it. Maybe a little cameo performance.

""A lot of it is based on personal experience – especially the middle book, that was my period, cooking in England from the 60s to now.”

Prue even has plans for one of the main roles in the drama.

She says: “There’s a character in the first book, very pompous, ex-army, and I think I’d like Nathaniel Parker, a lovely actor, to play that.”

Speaking at the Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year awards where she was also a judge, Prue said of Bake Off: “It’s an ego trip. People who stop you in the supermarket are really nice.”

But she never watches it.

She says: “I’m so vain, all I can think is ‘why won’t they stop filming my double chin?’ ”",mainstream,M1399e,pizzagate
244,"The people of the United States have been undergoing several massive crime waves since the beginning of the Bill & Hillary regime. What we have been experiencing now is nothing less that a full scale war upon every man woman and child in this country ­ the only thing absent has been a full-on military assault upon the nation by the criminally controlled feral government, masquerading as the legitimate armed forces of the country. What we have been able to see is the nearly completed shell, above, that is meant to turn our cities into prisons, while they continue to cut us off from the natural world and from the real life that most of us once enjoyed... The last 'selection' was meant to complete the above lockdown ­ but Hillary lost, and along with that massive failure, the nation seemed to have a real opportunity to finally turn everything around. Listen to this interview conducted just three days before the selection ­ because this includes most of what Trump promised he was going to directly address ­ not maybe-sometime-later: But these crimes were to be Trump's first considerationwhich was why he won. What Americans seem to have forgotten is that most of these crimes originated On U.S. Soil - which makes them not only crimes but crimes against the Constitution and the Republic, because those doing these crimes have already sworn allegiance to foreign powers, over their supposed oath, to protecting and serving the United States of America. The public already has all the information, no further investigations need to be opened ­ all we need to do is act on what we already know. In the case of Obama, both he and Michael should be arrested on January 20th at 12:01 pm for Grand-theft and Fraud by U.S, Marshall's, as he and his male-partner, who's pretending to be a woman, attempt to leave the podium. Their basic crime was impersonating normal people, with a family when the kids they have were rented, and are not their flesh & blood ­ which makes the billions that have been spent on the Obama's as a family a massive fraud upon the taxpayers that paid out all that money to maintain the fake leadership of the United States of America. Everything else which includes being a global-war-criminal, a lying con artist, a Muslim instead of a Christian, and a communist just the prologue to the tens of thousands that have died on his 'watch'. Not to mention all the thousands of fake laws he's written ­ or the fact that his entire career had only one purpose throughout - which was and still is the absolute desecration of the people of the United States. At the same time, Attorney General Lynch should also be arrested for the coverup and complicity with Hillary Clinton Chelsea Hubble and Bill Clinton for their complicity in major crimes committed by the totally illegal Clinton Foundation ­ that must be seized and their officers arrested and held for treason against the United Stateswhile all the assets of the Clinton Cash Machine must be seized under RICO while the prosecution moves forward. The child pornography, the sex trafficking, and all the key players in the Pizzagate, together with the Podesta Brothers, along with Huma Abadein and the key players from that side of the massive blackmail and sexual perversions, as well the blatantly criminal elements within the Democrat and Republican party's and their privately controlled assassins; the records of which, already exist. There are over thirty years of filth and crime that remain unpunished ­ which Trump initially promised to act upon before he was elected: However within 48 hours,, after he clearly had the nomination ­ Donald Trump began to systematically deny that he was actually planning to do any of the things described above ­ which has been what is altering the public view of the man who has suddenly reverted to being just another corporate shill... Here are TWO hugely important articles that underscore some of the major discrepancies behind both the current TRUMP positions and any successful way forward - This should begin by putting the rolly-polly Loretta Lynch on the front lines in North Dakota - on the side of the protesters so she can face the mace, the water-cannons, the grenades and the rubber bullets and then she can tell us all about the basic laws that rule in this complete cluster-fuck - which her department started when they rode roughshod over all the legal-treaties that the US signed with the native-people - not to mention the RIGHT TO CLEAN WATER THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY GUARANTEED TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES - IN THE US CONSTITUTION - WHICH HERE UNDER LYNCH, WITH HER IN-HOUSE CRIMINALS HAVE DECIDED TO OVERRIDE ­ JUST TO MAKE A FEW BUCKS WHOSE JOBS ARE THE ONLY ONES AT STAKE IF THIS DEAL FINALLY GETS STOPPED!

1316,"This book serves as an easy-to-read, up-to-­date practical guide on professional corporate communication. The key market for this book is the Asia-Pacific region, mainly because there is a gap in know-how in corporate communication among many industry sectors. In addition, at present, one cannot find a lot of educational literature about corporate communication in the market. Therefore, this guidebook closes that gap. In Asia, companies are starting to realize the importance of corporate communication in all areas (external and internal corporate communication, crisis communication (Example: TEPCO) and political communication / government relations / lobbying). This is triggered not only by the recent high profile and success of targeted (political) communication in the USA, but also by the notorious export-orientation of many Asian companies and their increasingly multi-national orientation (fostered by M&A and foreign investments). In addition, the increasing importance of online communication and digital/social media is an important reason why existing guidebooks on corporate communication have to be reassessed and modernized. This book focuses on all major aspects of modern corporate communication, including online / digital communication, and covers new developments, such as “fake news”, “post-truths”, “political correctness”, “the art of bridging” and other new phenomena in the world of (corporate) communication. Simple cartoon-style drawings supplement the text in order to facilitate reading and learning. Corporate communication professional, as well as students and professors in business/management programs, will be given tools to effectively and successfully plan and implement corporate communication strategies and tactics in all major areas.",mainstream,M13c90,pizzagate
380,"The FBI has identified prominent conspiracy theories, including the sprawling rightwing hoax known as QAnon, as motivators for “domestic extremists” to carry out violence in the US.

The warning comes from an agency bulletin produced by the FBI’s Phoenix field office, first reported by Yahoo News. It states that “anti-government, identity based, and fringe political conspiracy theories very likely motivate some domestic extremists, wholly or in part, to engage in criminal or violent activity”.

The bulletin warns that “certain conspiracy theory narratives tacitly support or legitimize violent action”, and that “some, but not all individuals or domestic extremists who hold such beliefs will act on them”.

It further warns that conspiracy theories will continue to spread and incite violence unless social media companies make “significant efforts” to “remove, regulate, or counter potentially harmful conspiratorial content”.

Examples given in the report include the October 2018 Tree of Life synagogue massacre, which the FBI describes as being motivated by the “Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory”; the “Pizzagate”-inspired attack on Washington’s Comet Ping Pong restaurant in December 2016; and an incident in June 2018, when a believer in the “QAnon” conspiracy theory blocked traffic at Hoover Dam in Nevada with an armored truck.

In the latter case, the bulletin says that the man “sent letters from jail containing a distinctive QAnon slogan to President Trump”.

Elsewhere the report discusses false 2018 claims by a border militia, Veterans on Patrol, that they had discovered a child sex trafficking camp near Tucson, Arizona, and the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, following which “conspiracy theorists who believed the shooting was a government hoax harassed and threatened family members of the slain victims”.

Currently, several families of Sandy Hook victims are suing the conspiracy-minded broadcaster Alex Jones for what they say is his role in promoting “false flag” narratives – baseless claims that the shooting was covert operation aimed at deceiving and disarming Americans.

The bulletin accords social media a central role in promoting conspiracy theories to a wider audience. It states: “The advent of the Internet and social media has enabled promoters of conspiracy theories to produce and share greater volumes of material via online platforms that larger audiences of consumers can quickly and easily access.”

As a result, the bulletin says, “it is logical to assume that more extremist-minded individuals will be exposed to potentially harmful conspiracy theories, accept ones that are favorable to their views, and possibly carry out criminal or violent actions”.

The QAnon conspiracy theory, which has emerged in the Trump era, is based on posts by an anonymous user on the 4chan and 8chan websites that believers attempt to decipher. While the QAnon narrative is sprawling and incoherent, many believers hold that Donald Trump is leading a behind-the-scenes fight against elements of the “deep state”, including figures such as Hillary Clinton and the former FBI director James Comey.

Recently, Trump has acted in ways that have encouraged believers to think that he is sympathetic to their cause. At a Greenville rally on 17 July, Trump singled out a “beautiful baby” whose jumpsuit was adorned with the “Q” symbol. And earlier this week, Trump retweeted an account that promoted QAnon.

FBI critics, though, worry that the bulletin exhibits the same excesses as previous reports identifying threats from so-called “black identity extremists” and other groups.

Michael German is a former FBI officer and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. He called the bulletin “troubling”, saying that “it continues to promote the concept of radicalization – that it’s bad ideas that put people on the path to violence”.

From the perspective of law enforcement officers, German said, “all it does is ramp up the fear of people whose ideas are strange”.

He also said the logic of the bulletin promoted a baseless fear of the internet and further justified mass surveillance: “If the spread of ideas is the problem, then preventing the spread of ideas is the solution.

“Are there conspiracy theorists who commit violence? Yes. But you’re talking about a small amount of cases alongside millions of people who believe in conspiracy theories,” German added, saying that such reports “seem to have the function of getting the FBI over the one hurdle the Justice Department has imposed” in protecting first amendment activity.

The FBI bulletin concludes with the bleak prediction that “conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace over the near term, fostering anti-government sentiment, promoting racial and religious prejudice, increasing political tensions, and occasionally driving both groups and individuals to commit criminal or violent acts”.

It does hold out hope that “significant efforts by major social media companies and websites to remove, regulate, or counter potentially harmful conspiratorial content” might change this assessment.",mainstream,M1cecb,pizzagate
247,"A New Jersey government worker has been arrested on child pornography charges after he was caught using the same pedophile code words that John Podesta used in his leaked emails.

According to the Acting United States Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick, 37-year-old Stephen Salamak, of Lodi, New Jersey was arrested by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) after placing an advert on Craigslist requesting “cheese pizza.”

According to an internal FBI document leaked by WikiLeaks, “cheese pizza” is pedophile code for “very young girl.” This pedophile code word – among others – appears liberally in John Podesta’s emails, also released by WikiLeaks in the latter stages of the 2016 presidential election.

While Stephen Salamak, a lowly New Jersey government employee, was arrested after his use of the term tipped off law enforcement to his alleged crimes, John Podesta remains free.

Salamak was charged with receiving child pornography according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. Speculation that the corrections officers advert was related to Pizzagate has now begun to circulate across forums and social media.The criminal complaint against Salamak as reported by local news Press of Atlantic City states: “In May, an undercover law enforcement officer responded to a Craigslist ad, placed by Salamak, seeking “Woman/Moms that are into Cheese Pizza.”

The Goldwater reports: The complaint said Salamak communicated with the undercover officer and requested photos of an 8-year-old child. In July, authorities executed a search of Salamak’s email account, finding he communicated with multiple people about pornography and pedophilia.”

A search warrant of Salamak’s home was executed on Thursday, where admitted to authorities “Cheese Pizza” was a reference to child pornography, he knowing received emails containing child porn and knowingly communicated with various individuals regarding child pornography and pedophilia.”

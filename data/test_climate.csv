153,"A ship carrying passengers who included a group of ‘Climate Change Warriors’ who are concerned about melting Arctic ice got stuck in the ice halfway between Norway and the North Pole.

“Arctic tours ship MS MALMO with 16 passengers on board got stuck in ice on Sep 3 off Longyearbyen, Svalbard Archipelago,” reports the Maritime Bulletin. “The ship is on Arctic tour with Climate Change documentary film team, and tourists, concerned with Climate Change and melting Arctic ice.”

The passengers were safely evacuated by helicopter.

“Something is very wrong with Arctic ice, instead of melting as ordered by UN/IPCC, it captured the ship with Climate Change Warriors,” joked Erofey Schkvarkin.

The story is similar to a 2014 incident when a Chinese icebreaker had to be sent to rescue dozens of global warming researchers and environmentalists who got stranded on a ship which got stuck in the Antarctic ice.

Poster child environmentalist Greta Thunberg has not commented on the latest incident.

7,"Constitution or not, President Obama created an exorbitant bill for U.S. taxpayers when he signed on to the Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Just as this article went to press, President Trump announced the U.S. has withdrawn from the agreement. “As of today,” stated Trump, “the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund, which is costing the United States a vast fortune.”

Treaties, according to the Constitution (the supreme law of the land), are only to be ratified if approved first by the U.S. Senate. President Barack Obama figured there was no way the Senate would approve the proposed Paris Global Climate Treaty, so he or his string-pullers decided to simply relabel it as the Global Climate Agreement and pretend an obvious treaty was not a treaty.

While campaigning for president, Donald Trump made some very important promises, one of which was to cancel Obama’s phony “ratification” of the global climate treaty. After being elected president, he has been under pressure from “greens” to back off on his promise.

Under Obama, the U.S. pledged $3 billion to the “Green Climate Fund” (GCF) in connection with the unconstitutional treaty or “agreement.” Of this, $1 billion was transferred before he left office. Trump’s budget sets out to block the rest.

Trump stated: “I can say this—we want to be treated fairly. It’s not a fair situation, because [other countries] are paying virtually nothing, and we are paying massive amounts of money.”

Prior to the Paris summit, the so-called “richer” countries committed to mobilize $100 billion of climate finance by 2020. The GCF was set up with $10 billion of initial donations. China, for one, has contributed nothing to the GCF.

Obama atrophied the Senate by making an end run around the Constitution. Trump now has the opportunity to make the Senate great again by canceling the illegal treaty and returning us to due process according to the rule book.

The climate deal itself is meaningless, wrote Oren Cass in Politico on Nov. 29, 2015.

“Emissions reductions are barely on the table at all,” he wrote. “Instead, the talks [were] rigged to ensure an agreement is reached, regardless of how little action countries plan to take.” In other words, the whole thing is a massive, devastating boondoggle.

The agreement would unfairly force the United States to reduce its carbon emissions, while allowing other countries to increase theirs.

In any case, the whole thing would do “nothing to meaningfully decrease global temperatures,” says Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).

According to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study, the Paris pact could obliterate $3 trillion of GDP, wipe out 6.5 million American jobs, and cut $7,000 in per capita household income in the U.S. by 2040. Just meeting the 2025 “goals” would wipe out 2.7 million jobs and cut U.S. GDP by $250 billion.

The Paris pact would seriously handicap America in the search for new sources of energy, while Russia is committing financial and military assets to developing the Arctic’s vast mineral deposits, including oil and gas, and China is also exploring and developing resources.



It is not enough and would be unwise to merely seek to renegotiate America’s role in this monstrosity. Trump’s best way forward is to repudiate the pact and insist it be submitted to the Senate, along with his recommendation that they do not ratify it.

If you agree, let Trump know right away how you feel.

Rising temperatures, melting arctic ice, rising sea levels, drought, desertification and other catastrophic effects of global warming are not examples of future troubles but are a reality today. Climate change isn't just about the environment, though; its effects touch every part of our lives, from the stability of our governments and economies to our health and where we live.

­Where would you go if, say, a flood devastated the city you live in? Millions of people­ around the world have been forced to answer this question, and extreme weather disasters and deteriorating ecological conditions will force nearly a billion more to face the same question in the next 50 years [source: The Guardian]. These people are climate refugees, also known by dozens of other names, including environmental refugees, eco-migrants, environmental migrants and environmental displacees. Recently, climate refugees who leave their home but stay in their own country have been called internally displaced persons (IDPs) who experience environmentally induced population movements (EIPMs).

It's hard to pin down the first reference to climate refugees. In 1958, they were called ""primitive migrants."" The modern-day ""refugee"" term is attributed to the later 1970s and Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute, a coinage that's disputed by many academics who accredit the term to a 1985 United Nations report by Essam El-Hinnawi. And to complicate things further, there's no clear definition with which to designate a person as a climate refugee, nor is there consensus that these ""refugees"" are refugees at all.

Under the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention, a refugee is a person who ""owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country"" [source: Reuters]. Climate refugees do not legally fall under this status.

­In the mid-1980s, El-Hinnawi defined environmental refugees as ""people who have been forced to leave their traditional habitat, temporarily or permanently, because of a marked environmental disruption (natural and/or triggered by people) that jeopardized their existence and/or seriously affected the quality of their life"" [source: Worldwatch Institute]. This working definition has been the baseline for current debate. Without a method of classification there's no good way to track how many people have been affected, although the International Federation of Red Cross estimates 25 to 50 million people are climate refugees today [source: Center for American Progress].",mainstream

263,"Massive and meaty, the Taku in Alaska's Juneau Icefield was a poster child for the frozen places holding their own against . As the largest of 20 major glaciers in the region and one of the single thickest glaciers in the world (it measures 4,860 feet, or 1,480 meters, from surface to floor), Taku had been demonstrably gaining mass and spreading farther into the nearby Taku river for nearly half a century, while all of its neighboring glaciers shrank. Now, it appears those glory days are over.

In a new pair of satellite photos shared by , the slow decline of Taku Glacier has finally become apparent. Taken in August 2014 and August 2018, the photos show the icy platforms where the glacier meets the river retreating for the first time since scientists began studying Taku, in 1946.

While the shrinkage is subtle for now, the results are nonetheless shocking. According to glaciologist Mauri Pelto, who has studied the Juneau Icefield for three decades, Taku was predicted to continue advancing for the rest of the century. Not only have these signs of retreat arrived about 80 years ahead of schedule, Pelto said, but they also snuff a symbolic flicker of hope in the race to understand climate change. Of 250 mountain (or ""alpine"") glaciers that Pelto has studied around the world, Taku was the only one that hadn't clearly started to retreat.

""This is a big deal for me because I had this one glacier I could hold on to,"" Pelto, a professor at Nichols College in Massachusetts, told NASA. ""But not anymore. This makes the score climate change: 250 and alpine glaciers: 0.""

Pelto discovered Taku Glacier's retreat as part of a new study published Oct. 14 in the journal . Using satellite data, Pelto looked at a region of the glacier known as the transient snow line, or the place where snow disappears and bare glacial ice begins. If a glacier loses more mass to melting than it gains from snow accumulation during a particular year, its snow line moves to higher altitudes. The relative position of this line can help researchers calculate changes in the glacier's mass from year to year.

Historical records show that between 1946 to 1988, Taku Glacier had been gaining mass and advancing (that is, growing) by about a foot per year. After that, the advancement began to slow and the ice started to thin a bit. From 2013 to 2018, advancement stopped altogether — then, in 2018, the glacier finally started to retreat. In that year, Pelto observed the greatest mass loss and the highest snow line in Taku glacier's history. Those changes coincided with the on record in Juneau, Pelto wrote.

While it was inevitable for even a glacier as thick as Taku to transition eventually from a period of advancement to one of retreat, those transitions generally result after decades of stability where the glacier's edge does not move at all. Taku's transition from growth to decay, meanwhile, seems to have lasted only a few years.

""To be able to have the transition take place so fast indicates that climate is overriding the natural cycle of advance and retreat that the glacier would normally be going through,"" Pelto said.",mainstream

1137,"On December 2, 1970, a new federal agency opens its doors. Created in response to the dawning realization that human activity can have major effects on the planet, the Environmental Protection Agency heralded a new age of government action on behalf of the environment.

Concerns about pollution and other environmental issues began creeping into the American consciousness in the 1950s and 60s. The 1962 publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring was a watershed moment for American environmental awareness, as were a major oil spill that affected California beaches and the burning of Ohio’s heavily-polluted Cuyahoga River in 1969. That same year, Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act, which mandated that government agencies compile environmental statistics and produce environmental impact statements before proceeding with projects that could affect the environment. Given the number of offices across the executive branch that were now tasked with enforcing environmental regulations, President Richard Nixon decided in July of 1970 to create a single agency to deal with environmental issues, and the EPA was born.

READ MORE: The Shocking River Fire That Fueled the Creation of the EPA

The EPA was flooded with resumes from environmentalists excited by the idea that the government would finally act on their concerns. It opened with 5,8000 employees and a budget of $1.4 billion, led by former Justice Department lawyer William Ruckelshaus. Conscious of the importance of establishing the new administration's authority, Ruckelshaus acted aggressively to enforce the Clean Water Act, secure a ban on the pesticide DDT, and prosecute the corporations responsible for polluting the Cuyahoga. Thanks to his efforts, the EPA has maintained its role as a strong enforcer, and the position of EPA Administrator is considered cabinet-level despite the EPA not technically being a cabinet agency. Like all federal agencies, however, it is only as powerful as the executive allows—after years of relatively aggressive action on climate change, the EPA deleted almost all references to the global climate crisis from its website after President Donald Trump took office.",mainstream
950,"Meat has earned a bad reputation as an environmentally damaging food, in part because beef production is known to emit 20 times more greenhouse gases than bean production for the same protein benefit.

But is meat getting too much of the blame?

A Japan-based study, widely regarded as reflective of most wealthy nations, found that the consumption of sweets, alcohol and restaurant food adds to families’ carbon footprints in a larger capacity than other food and drink choices.

The findings warn against applying one-size-fits-all policies to change the consumption behaviors that are most accelerating man-made climate change.

The researchers, based at the U.K.’s University of Sheffield and the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature in Kyoto, Japan, analyzed the carbon footprints of the diets of 60,000 households across Japan’s 47 regions. They found that meat consumption was relatively constant per household but carbon footprints were not. Eating out was found to contribute on average 770 kilograms of greenhouse gases per year for those households with a higher footprint, whereas meat contributed just 280 kilograms.

The study published in the journal One Earth showed that meat consumption could explain less than 10% of the difference seen in carbon footprints between Japanese families. Instead, households with higher carbon footprints tended to consume more food from restaurants, as well as more vegetables and fish. However, it was the level of consumption of sweets and alcohol — two to three times higher than families with low carbon footprints — that really stood out.

Read:Steak ta-ta? We need to reach ‘peak meat’ in 10 years to combat climate change

“If we are serious about reducing our carbon footprints, then our diets must change,” said study author and associate professor Keiichiro Kanemoto at the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature in Kyoto. “If we think of a carbon tax, it might be wiser to target sweets and alcohol if we want a progressive system... to target less-nutritious foods that are excessively consumed in some populations.”

Large and small spirits manufacturers, which rely heavily on land, water and transportation, have joined the shift toward sustainable practices, to varying degrees, in part because younger consumers demand it. Among them, Bacardi, beginning five years ago, claimed to be a leader in its industry for opening up its sustainability goal-tracking for public scrutiny.

The study’s focus on Japan is significant for consumption habits in most industrial countries. Its population is one of the oldest in the world, a trend that many wealthy countries are following. The Japanese also have a relatively healthy diet, which is frequently attributed to them having the world’s longest life span by country.

“Due to wealth, culture and farming practices, different regions in a country consume food differently,” said study co-author Dr. Christian Reynolds of the Institute of Sustainable Food at the University of Sheffield. “This evidence from Japan demonstrates that research can help us to identify what to focus on. The same patterns of dietary change in terms of sugar, alcohol and dining out need to be considered in the U.K., Australia, the U.S. and Europe.”

The U.S.-based National Restaurant Association was not available to comment on any lessons or takeaways from the Japanese study because of holiday schedules. Its own research has shown that U.S. trends favoring eating out for diversity in culinary offerings and as a form of entertainment, as well as an increase in placing take-out and delivery orders, aren’t slowing down. Baby boomers wish they could use restaurants more often than millennials or Gen Xers, says the trade group, which did release an annual report in 2018 on industry efforts toward sustainability.

Within the restaurant study, Kanemoto does address red meat, recommending eating less to reduce a household’s environmental impact overall. “Meat is a high-carbon-footprint food. Replacing red meat consumption with white meat and vegetables will lower a family’s carbon footprint,” he said.

Don’t miss: Making this simple change to your diet could help you live longer and reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease by 16%

For certain, high-meat diets have increasingly been the target of climate-change research.

In an early-December letter published in The Lancet Planetary Health Journal, a group of 50 scientists said that all but the poorest countries, where accessing protein for survival outweighs being selective about the source, should set a time frame for livestock production to stop expanding.

If the meat and dairy sector were to continue on its present trajectory, it would account for almost half of the emissions that the researchers expect between now and 2030, those scientists said. To limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C, the global annual emission reduction needed is 7.6% every year between 2020 and 2030, according to the voluntary pledge laid out in the Paris climate agreement.

Don’t miss: Vegetarian diets can’t save Earth, but eating less meat might

While meat is a favorite target of those hoping for a change in farming and consumption, vegetarians aren’t blameless when it comes to climate impact. That’s because if vegetarians eat cheese or dairy products their demand for livestock is equally high.

Findings from scientists at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health found that diets in which meat, fish or dairy products were consumed only once a day have a smaller negative impact on emissions and water supplies than exclusively vegetarian diets of three meals a day, including milk and eggs, in 95% of countries analyzed.

Emissions from livestock account for about 14.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions, globally, and roughly two-thirds of those emissions come from cattle, particularly the methane gas emitted by the animals, according to United Nations data. Growing feed, a process with its own emissions, and clearing land for grazing and crops also has an environmental impact.

The beef industry has argued that campaigns against eating meat are short-sighted, in part because the discussion doesn’t focus enough on what the industry is doing toward sustainability. Sara Place, senior director of sustainability for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, said her own research in combination with USDA findings that points to fewer cattle producing more meat as farms got more efficient. That’s a sign, she says, that points to producers doing more toward sustainability from the supply side — including addressing methane — rather than bowing to demands for less meat consumption.",mainstream
459,"Author and attorney Ellen Brown says the drought in California is dire. NASA recently said that California has just one year of water left. Brown says, “It was just declared our number one emergency. . . .It’s pretty shocking what is happening. It’s our fourth year of drought. The Governor just declared that all the cities must cut back 25% in water usage. . . . The water districts are being fined $10,000 for going over, and you can get a $500 fine for doing a 10 minute shower instead of a 5 minute shower. They have smart meters that can show specifically how long your shower was, which is kind of scary in itself.”

Brown goes on to say, “What makes me suspicious is this wall of weather that prevents the jet stream from pushing storms that usually come from the Pacific Ocean across California, Oregon and Washington State. So, that’s been going on for 4 years, and nobody knows what causes it. It is highly suspicious, and it may be caused by HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program). That’s the military use of Tesla technology, or it could be caused by geoengineering, which is chemtrails. A lot of people call this conspiracy theory, but if you look up in the skies, you can see them. The skies are crisscrossed, and they are dropping aluminum and barium on the land. California supplies the nation with 50% of their produce. Most of the organic produce comes from California. So, if you are putting aluminum on all the land, there is going to be no such thing as organic anymore. All food and all crops are being poisoned by this aluminum.”

Wall Street is getting involved with the coming water wars. Brown says, “Goldman Sachs has declared that water is now the new oil. So, they are buying up all of these water rights, and there are huge funds set aside for water. They attempted to privatize the Reno water district and then lease it back to the city of Reno, but the people protested. That’s the model you see everywhere. They are privatizing everything and then leasing it back in perpetuity for many multiples for what we were paying in the first place. . . . The reservoirs only have one year of water left. When you use all of that, then you have ground water, and that’s when you have all of these water wars.”

Brown goes on to say, “Food prices have not sky rocketed—yet. . . . That could be a problem, and people will be pointing to inflation, and they will probably blame government money printing, but that’s not it. It will be caused by drought. . . . Just last year, California lost $2.2 billion on agriculture. I think they are down by $5 billion total from the drought, but if you count all the other western states, it’s much more than that. Of course, food prices are going to go up, and everybody is going to pay for it in one way or another.”

So, with just one year’s worth of water left in California, what is being done other than conservation? Brown, shockingly, says, “There are no solutions that are happening right now. We have had conservation and toilets that use less water, but I don’t see the government doing anything that will fix the problem right now. . . . The plan seems to be charge more for water, but that doesn’t fix the problem. I have read that officials have said we have no backup plan.”

1067,"Beyoncé and Stevie Wonder both participated in the star-studded Hand in Hand: A Benefit for Hurricane Relief

Beyoncé Speaks Out About Climate Change as Stevie Wonder Calls Out Global Warming Deniers: You 'Must be Blind'

Before Wonder, 67, kicked off the one-hour special a performance of “Lean on Me,” the 25-time Grammy winner did mince his words – but did throw in a little joke – as he addressed those who deny the effects of global warming.

“We’ve come together today to love on the people that have been devastated by the hurricanes. When love goes into action, it prefaces no color of skin, no ethnicity, no religious beliefs, no sexual preferences, and no political persuasions. It just loves,” Wonder said.

“As we should begin to love and value our planet and anyone who believes there is no such thing as global warming must be blind or unintelligent. Lord, save us all.”

Wonder’s comments come after President Donald Trump announced in June that the U.S. will be pulling out of the historic Paris Accord, an agreement on climate change and environmental policy, signed just over a year ago by then-Secretary of State John Kerry.

Also during the telethon, Beyoncé gave heartfelt comments to the people of her hometown of Houston following the devastation of Hurricane Harvey.

“During the time where it’s impossible to watch the violence or racism in this country, just when you think it couldn’t possibly get worse. Natural disasters take precious life, do massive damage and forever change lives, leaving behind contaminated waters, flooded hospitals, schools and nursing homes. And countless families are now homeless,” the mother of three said in a video message, which aired during the event.

“In my hometown city of Houston, people need food, clothing and cleaning supplies, blankets, shoes, diapers and formula for babies and of course, clean water. The elderly need wheelchairs and kids need books and toys so they can continue to dream,” the 22-time Grammy winner continued.

“Natural disasters don’t discriminate. They don’t see if you’re an immigrant, black or white, Jewish or Muslim, wealthy or poor. It doesn’t matter if you’re from Third Ward or River Oaks, we’re all in this together,” she said, adding, “Seeing everyone of different racial, social and religious backgrounds put their own lives at risk to help each other survive, restored my faith in humanity.

“True healing isn’t helping please give what you can. The effects of climate change are playing out around the world every day. Just this past week, we’ve seen devastation from the monsoon in India and 8.1 earthquake in Mexico and multiple catastrophic hurricanes. Irma alone has left a trail of death and destruction from the Caribbean to Florida to southern United States. We have to prepared for what comes next so tonight we come together in a collective effort to raise our voices, help our communities, to lift our spirits and heal,” she concluded.

1190,"The problematique of global climate change is usually investigated in a ceteris paribus framework, i.e., impacts and driving forces are embedded in the world as it presents itself nowadays. In parallel, however, quite a number of other phenomena of global environmental change take place: soil degradation, shortage of freshwater resources, or the massive loss of biodiversity are just a few examples. Furthermore drastic socio-economic developments take place: the globalization of economy and society, the still increasing international indebtedness, the hefty progress in information technologies and many others more. All these complexly interconnected symptoms of Global Change call for an integrated research strategy which can serve as the information and evaluation base for rough but robust global environmental management strategies. In this paper we want to present a research approach which from our point of view is capable to include most of the relevant trends and symptoms of Global Change. The approach is based on the assumption that Global Change can be decomposed into archetypical patterns of civilization-nature interactions, called syndromes of Global Change (Schellnhuber et al., 1997). Besides a general discussion of the syndrome concept we sketch some qualitative ideas how this approach can be applied to evaluate climate change mitigation strategies with respect to synergies and side-effects.",mainstream

534,"It seems hell may have frozen over as notorious petrol head Jeremy Clarkson has signalled he is ready to turn green after witnessing the troubling impact of climate change.

The 59-year-old former Top Gear star (who now stars on Amazon’s high octane car reviewing show The Grand Tour) seems to have had a change of heart after witnessing dramatic changes to landscapes in South East Asia.

Jezza, who has long expressed his love for petrol guzzling machinery, felt the penny drop while filming a boat race from Cambodia to Vietnam on The Grand Tour.

The high speed race slowed to a snails pace, however, when they were travelling through Tonlé Sap lake in the Mekong river system which had been reduced to not much more than a “trickle”, he told The Sunday Times.

“The irony is not lost on me. A man who hosted a car programme for 30 years, limited to 7mph by global warming,” he said.

“It’s the first time that we’ve ever admitted to there being global warming… there was no water in the Tonle Sap lake. I mean, it was knee-deep. And you could paddle in it. So we had two days of absolute frustration - being towed and grounded,” he confessed.

Jeremy’s realisation comes just three weeks since he attempted to suggest global warming could be good for everyone in a column for The Sun.

He wrote comparing the current climate situation to past changes in the environment where past changes in environment led to the creation of “warmer and wetter” landscapes allowing mankind to thrive around the world.

“That’s the thing about climate change. We keep being told the next shift will be a disaster for mankind. But who knows? You might wake up one morning to find your garden full of unicorns and mermaids and big chests full of jewels and money,” he wrote at the time.

He has also previously slated child prodigy climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, recently writing after she spoke at the UN: “We gave you mobile phones and laptops and the internet. We created the social media you use every day and we run the banks that pay for it all. So how dare you stand there and lecture us, you spoilt brat.”",mainstream
921,"Dr. Houghton’s other books include “Global Warming: The Complete Briefing,” first published in 1994, and “Does God Play Dice? A Look at the Story of the Universe” (1988).

He married Margaret Broughton in 1962; she died in 1986. In 1988, he married Sheila Thompson. In addition to his granddaughter Hannah, he is survived by his wife; two children from his first marriage, Peter Houghton and Janet Malcolm; a younger brother, Paul; and six other grandchildren. An older brother, David, died in 2015.

In recent years Dr. Houghton had retired to the Welsh seaside and was fading into dementia, Hannah Malcolm said, adding: “But the sea remained with him. A good life.”

As a leader of the I.P.C.C., he had the skills of a statesman, said Jean-Pascal van Ypersele of the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. He recalled watching Dr. Houghton co-chair a meeting in 1995 in Madrid that led to a statement that the smoking gun of climate change had been found: The influence of human activities on climate was becoming discernible in observations of the present, not just in projections of the future.

“Fossil fuel companies and oil-dependent countries were intensely lobbying at that I.P.C.C. meeting to try to dilute the message,” Dr. van Ypersele said. But Dr. Houghton, he added, “had a deep understanding of the science,” and “he was also a British gentleman, able to listen patiently to the views of vested interests, and manage the meeting so that scientists would have the last word, as it should be.”

After a marathon session that was still going at 4 a.m., the tough language was approved.

Despite such efforts, however, effective global action to blunt the effects of a warming world has yet to happen. In a series of Twitter messages about her grandfather, Ms. Malcolm said: “When I was younger, my consistent memory of him was warnings over the devastation waiting us if we didn’t act on climate change. And I remember thinking how glad I was that scientists like him were in charge. But of course it isn’t the scientists in charge.”",mainstream
1022,"Climate engineering researcher Dane Wigington says out of control wildfires are not just in California, but a global phenomenon and unlike ever before. Wigington explains, “Let’s look at the facts. This summer we had a state of emergency in British Columbia with nearly 600 wildfires. We had similar circumstances in Alaska, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Siberia. When you look at these massive fires in California, like the Carr fire over the summer or the campfire that just happened, the Carr fire 240,000 acres burned. In the campfire, 140,000 acres burned. Siberia, in recent years, has lost a hundred million acres, and nobody reports on that. So, we are losing forests all over the globe at an unbelievable rate.”What’s to blame for the massive amount of wildfires? Wigington says it is caused by geoengineering or climate engineering, which is basically spraying the skies with metal particles to reflect the sun in order to cool the planet. Wigington says, “The single greatest causal factor that has set the stage for these wildfires is climate engineering.”

Wigington contends the conditions for wildfires are being intensified on purpose because the smoke from massive global wildfires blocks the sun and temporarily cools the planet. Wigington says, “Wildfire smoke in northern latitude forests has specifically been named in a manner that would consider them to have a desirable effect on the Arctic. What we can also say about the fires’ intensity and conditions that has allowed these fires to do what they have done are absolutely the result of climate engineering. That is without question. . . . The reason these areas are so dried out is a direct result of climate engineering. . . . Otherwise, we would have more rain on a warming planet. Statistically, we would have 7% more moisture in the atmosphere for every degree of C (celsius) warming.”

All the climate engineering, commonly called chemtrails, is making unnatural swings in temperatures, says Wigington, and he goes on to point out, “These events are absolutely not natural and not reflective of the entire global picture. Last week, we had snow falling in Louisiana . . . on the same day at midnight in Eagle Lake, Alaska, it was 45 degrees at midnight near the Arctic Circle. The official purpose of climate engineering is to mitigate a warming planet, but we know, statistically speaking, that climate engineering in exchange for toxic cool-downs . . . it actually further fuels the overall warming of the planet.”

Don’t expect to get the truth from the government or the mainstream media (MSM) that climate engineering is dangerous to humanity, let alone even going on, because Wigington says, “Right now, there is an official illegal federal gag order on all of the National Weather Service and NOAA. If all of the consequences of climate engineering were considered, it is mathematically the single greatest threat we collectively face short of nuclear cataclysm. If we don’t address these issues, it effects every breath we take and the entire web of life, we are on an extraordinary short time horizon. . . . Climate engineering is not about the greater good. It is about keeping business as usual and keeping power in the hands of people who already hold it. It’s about confusing and dividing the population about the true state of the climate until the last possible moment. . . . They are hiding the severity of the climate to keep the population from panicking because the situation is so severe. . . . Here in the U.S., we are importing about $41 billion worth of food annually to keep the U.S. store shelves stocked to keep Americans pacified and clueless as to what is happening around the world until the last possible moment. It is that severe.”

1126,"On 4 October, healthcare practitioners and stakeholders gathered at IDWeek 2019 in Washington DC to discuss issues related to the influence of climate change on infectious diseases.

Representatives from the local and national level highlighted trends indicating that a vast portfolio of pathogens is affected by climate change, particularly vector-borne agents like Lyme disease. A key point of emphasis was the need for a long-term commitment from the medical community to improving disease surveillance, climate preparedness, and local capacity to avert catastrophic epidemics.

According to the 4th Annual Climate Assessment published in 2018, the current period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization, and human activities are the dominant cause of observed climate deviations. Temperature and precipitation play significant roles in disease transmission by disturbing the replication, interaction, and propagation of infectious agents in disease vectors and the environment. 



Key climate-sensitive infectious diseases comprise zoonotic, food-borne, and vector-borne diseases, including infections like West Nile and Eastern Equine Encephalitis which have recently spread to broader regions of the US. Speakers emphasised that the first frost of the season is a critical factor in ending mosquito seasons and epidemics, and therefore fewer days of frost directly contributes to the increased seasonal risk of infection.

In 2017, there were 66,867 cases of infections from mosquitos, ticks, and fleas compared to 30,501 in 2006. Most importantly, the harms of climate change are disproportionately felt in low income and vulnerable communities.

One session focused on issues facing the state of Alaska, which contains numerous distinct ecological regions experiencing unique climate challenges. In recent years, Alaska has been battered by storm surges due to loss of sea ice, periods of unprecedented dryness, and summer temperatures exceeding 90 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time in recorded history. The loss of permafrost and other weather-related damage to Alaska’s modern infrastructure has impacted running water systems, particularly in more rural regions of the state. Several studies have identified a direct relationship between the availability of running water in Alaska and the incidence of pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and lower respiratory tract infections, particularly in children. Higher temperatures have also eroded permafrost-based food storage facilities, exposing inhabitants to greater risks of contaminated meat.

Even more directly, warming temperatures have facilitated the growth of microbiological organisms in previously inhospitable Alaskan regions. In 2004, Vibrio parahaemolyticus was identified for the first time in the Prince William Sound when several people fell ill after consuming raw oysters. It was found that temperatures in the water had drifted above 15 degrees Celsius for an extended period of time, which allowed uncharacteristic bacteria growth to facilitate the outbreak. Alaskan healthcare officials have advanced a one health initiative to combat the effects of climate change at the state, regional, and national levels, pushing to declare climate change a public health emergency.

According to survey data gathered from three medical societies, the majority of physicians believe climate change has direct relevance to patient care, with 70% believing it has already harmed individuals under their care. Data also indicates that the general public is less concerned about climate change than the medical community, but that their level of engagement increases once health concerns are raised.

Speakers at IDWeek concluded that proactive health actions on climate are the imperative of all healthcare practitioners. Key steps include engaging the health sector to call for action and incorporating climate solutions into public health systems to build resilient communities. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) has embraced this initiative by releasing a position statement on climate change and infectious diseases and moving to reduce its own environmental impact by eliminating paper waste and divesting from fossil fuel companies.

IDWeek is the joint annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the HIV Medical Association (HIVMA), and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS).

442,"Climate change is no laughing matter but the creativity behind some of the signs people have made throughout the years is pretty comical. When it comes to getting their points across, people really do come up with some of the most interesting things.

As you look over different signs and climate-related things online you will notice that the more eye-grabbing something is the more its message will be spread, I think that is something most of the people who made the following signs had in mind. While some are simple and clear others are outspoken and LOUD. These are, all things considered, some of the funniest and most thought-provoking in their own right climate signs I have come across.

Which of these have you seen before and how many speak to you? The Climate Strike protest is a very serious and prominent cause especially in modern times but these protest signs are something else. What do you think of all of these? Which is your favorite?

360,"Considered by some to be one of the world’s most eminent climate scientists, who has supported the theory of global warming for decades, has now shifted his opinion and become a skeptic of it.

Yes climate change is happening and it’s to be noted. But climate change is often linked with global warming, if there is a dramatic shift in our weather then our corporate media instantly attributes it to global warming.

The idea of global warming has been marketed and pushed on us so much so that anybody who questions it is made out to look like a fool.

For other skeptics out there, you are not alone, in fact, you are joined by hundreds of renowned scientists all over the world, including Professor Lennart Bengtsson who was recently added to the list. (1)(2)(3)(4)

Bengtsson is a researcher at the University of Reading, he is a Swedish climatologist, former director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg and winner of the 51st IMO Prize of the World Meteorological Organization for his pioneering work in numerical weather prediction.

He is most likely the most distinguished scientist yet to change his perspective on the global warming issue.

Four of the world’s top climate scientists (one of them being Bengtsson) had their recent research rejected by one of the world’s top academic journals.

The journal states that the paper contained error and did not provide a significant advancement in the field, and therefore failed to meet the journal’s required acceptance criteria.

They say that the paper is harmful “as it opens the door for oversimplified claims of ‘errors’ and worse from the climate skeptics media side.”

The paper suggested that the climate might be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than had been claimed by the IPCC in its report last September, and recommended that more work be carried out to reduce the underlying uncertainty.

He isn’t the only one who’s discord this, that will come later in the article.

“The problem we have now in the scientific community is that some scientists are mixing up their scientific role with that of climate activist. It is an indication of how science is gradually being influenced by political views.

“I am worried about the gradual influence of political views on science. Policy decisions need to be based on solid fact. The reality hasn’t been keeping up with the computer models.”(2)(3) – Professor Bengtsson

Bengtsson also became affiliated with the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) which is a charity that rejects arguments that climate change is manmade. He was ridiculed badly, and publicly for this so he chose to withdraw his membership, but clearly supports it.

This is an organization that is supported by various individuals. One for example, is Lord Lawson, who is the chairman and former Secretary of State for Energy in the 1980’s. Another is Lord Donoughue, Former Senior Policy Advisor to the Prime Minister.

It is supported by a number of ‘prestigious’ individuals and scientists from all over the world. You can find out more about them, and their supporters HERE. For a list of their academic advisory council, you can click HERE.

Again, if you are a global warming skeptic, you are not alone and in the company of some very prominent people.

I would like to emphasize that they are not climate change skeptics, they are skeptics with regards to the impact humans are having on climate change.

There are many factors that should be considered when studying climate change that go far beyond human activity (I will get into that later in the article).

Not long ago, NASA was blasted by approximately 50 of their own personnel regarding their global warming stance. (6)(7)

The founder of The Weather Network, John Coleman, has also expressed similar beliefs when he slammed the global warming theory on national television. (8)

It’s clear that much of the scientific community is split on this subject, yet all we hear in the mainstream media is how global warming via human induced activity is a fact.

“I have used most of my career to develop models for predicting the weather. I have learned the importance of forecasting validation, i.e. the verification of predictions with respect to what has really happened. So I am a friend of climate forecasts.

“But the review of model results is important in order to ensure their credibility. It is frustrating that climate science is not able to validate their simulations correctly.

“The warming of the Earth has been much weaker since the end of the 20th century compared to what climate models show. I have a great respect for the scientific work that goes into the IPCC reports.

“But I see no need for the endeavour of the IPCC to achieve a consensus. I think it is essential that there are areas of society where a consensus cannot be enforced. Especially in an area like the climate system, which is incompletely understood, a consensus is meaningless.” (2)(5)

I personally don’t believe that global warming skeptics should be attacked, and I don’t think this debate is ‘put to rest’ as so many mainstream media outlets continue to have us believe. That alone is no basis for truth.

There are other factors that play a role in climate change, and human emissions are probably one of them, but might not be as impactful as we have been made to believe.

No doubt, emissions are indeed destroying our environment and eco-system, but is the push of human induced global warming being used for a political agenda?

I’ll let you answer that one in the comment section. Bottom line, change needs to be made because human activity is indeed contributing to the destruction of our planet and loss of life.

Again, we know very little about Earth’s climate, climate change and what triggers it. The pollution we create doesn’t help, but so much emphasis has been pointed towards human activity (which we must change right away, it is destroying our planet) that we don’t look at other factors that play a key role.

Take the Sun for example. The Sun goes through an approximate 11 year cycle of activity, from stormy to quiet and back to stormy again.

“The fluctuations in the solar cycle impacts Earth’s global temperature, which becomes slightly hotter during solar maximum and cooler during solar minimums.” (9) – Thomas Woods, University of Colorado in Boulder

Massive bodies flying in and around our solar system also have an effect on the weather of all the planets in our solar system.

It’s well documented that solar activity has a direct effect on weather here on Earth, and that comet activity has a direct effect on solar weather. (9)(10)

Research results presented at the 2012 Fall American Geophysical Union illustrated that comets help highlight the intensely dynamic environment of the sun’s atmosphere. As a result they have a direct effect on the weather of all the planets in our solar system, and the Earth’s own magnetic field.

A recent report by Principia Scientific International’s (PSI) Martin Mlynczak alongside NASA tracked infrared emissions from the Earth’s upper atmosphere during and following a solar storm last March.

They found that the vast majority of energy released from the sun during this coronal mass ejection was reflected back up into space rather than deposited into Earth’s lower atmosphere.

The result of this was an overall cooling effect because carbon dioxide and nitric oxide (greenhouse gases) were reflecting heat energy rather than absorbing it. This study suggests carbon dioxide is in fact cooling the atmosphere. These findings correlate with the Vostok Data. (11)(12)(13)

The Vostok data refers to an ice core sample that was obtained by drilling down into the ice above Lake Vostok to a depth of 3623m. The graph built from the Vostok ice core data shows us the relationship between CO2 in the atmosphere and global temperature.

The Vostok data showed that CO2 increases lag behind temperature increases by about 800 years. This means that CO2 is not the cause of the increased temperatures, according to this data. (11)(12)(13)

With all of this information out there, I find it hard to believe why there is so much fuss when one questions our current understanding of climate change.

Regardless, it’s time to live in ways that are more harmonious with the planet and all that live upon it. It doesn’t have to be like this, we have solutions, we have better ways to generate energy.

There is no need for geoengineering, atmospheric spraying and other techniques to combat the effects of global climate change.",conspiracy

Nobel Physics Laureate Didier Queloz speaks during a press conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, Sweden Saturday, Dec. 7, 2019. (Jonas Ekstromer /TT News Agency via AP)

STOCKHOLM (AP) — An astronomer who shares this year’s Nobel physics prize for discovering a planet outside the Earth’s solar system is taking issue with people who shrug off climate change on the grounds that humans will eventually leave for distant planets.

Didier Queloz was one of several Nobel laureates who spoke about climate change at a news conference Saturday in Stockholm.

“I think this is just irresponsible, because the stars are so far away I think we should not have any serious hope to escape the Earth,” Queloz said.

“Also keep in mind that we are a species that has evolved and developed for this planet. We’re not built to survive on any other planet than this one,” he said. “We’d better spend our time and energy trying to fix it.”

Several other Nobel winners also urged that climate change be taken seriously. The remarks came as a two-week global summit on climate change is taking place in Madrid.

Esther Duflo, one of the Nobel economics laureates, cautioned that dealing with climate change “will require a change in behavior, particularly in the rich countries” that are heavy consumers of goods and energy.

She disagreed with those who believe there is no need to consume less as long as that consumption is fueled by renewable energy.

“It would be great if that were the case but I don’t think we can count on it necessarily,” Duflo said.

M. Stanley Whittingham, who shared this year’s Nobel chemistry award for helping to develop lithium-ion batteries, said “to help solve the climate issue, the time is right now, but we have to be pragmatic. ... We can’t just turn off all the CO2.”

Canadian-American James Peebles, who won half of this year’s 9-million-kronor ($948,000) Nobel physics prize for studying what happened soon after the Big Bang, later told The Associated Press that he is excited about the current wave of youthful climate change protesters.

“I see these people in Princeton, my hometown, as they go marching for control of climate. It is a wonderful thing. I love their enthusiasm, their energy, their devotion to something very worthwhile,” he said.

Whittingham also told the AP that he believed the climate protests would produce results.

“Maybe some of the young folks don’t realize how long it takes. But I go back to the Vietnam War era and the United States, where it was really the young people that pushed the politicians to get out and stop that nonsense,” he said.

1193,"An international survey of people’s news habits around the world reveals that Australians’ opinions on climate change are determined mostly by age and news source but that, overall, we are more likely to deny climate change than most other nations. And it is clear from the results of the 2020 Digital Media Report that a major reason for this denial is the influence of News Corp.

This year’s Digital News Report in Australia, which is produced by the News and Media Research Centre at the University of Canberra (disclosure, I am also employed by the university and wrote a commentary for this year’s report), covers a wide range of topics that investigate how people access news and what interests them.

The report has some pretty eye-opening results on the topic of climate change, which confirm longheld beliefs about the impact of the News Corp coverage of the issue.

Of the 40 countries that take part in the survey, which is coordinated by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford, only the US, Sweden and Norway have a higher percentage of news consumers who believe that climate change is either not serious at all or they don’t know if it is serious (which effectively means they do not think it is serious):

Just over one in five news consumers in Australia regard climate change as either not very serious, not serious at all or “don’t know”.

Given that the report was conducted during the recent horrific bushfire season, that result is rather stunning and depressing.

The problem is that, given you are reading this, you are not one of those people.

Of all online news outlets, Guardian Australia readers are second only to those who read Junkee in being extremely concerned about climate change, and third behind readers of the Conversation and Vice News, of those who are more than “somewhat concerned”.

And while we can give ourselves a pat on the back, a look down the bottom of the charts shows where the problem lies.

Nearly 30% of skynews.com.au readers don’t believe climate change is a serious issue (compared to 35% of those who watch Sky News TV), and we see News Corp websites dominate the news sites whose readers most deny climate change.

Mostly the views of the online readers aligns with that of the offline readers by brand, although those who consume ABC online are generally more likely to deny climate change than those who consume ABC TV and radio.

The survey of 2,131 news consumers found that age is also a major factor behind people’s views of climate change. Generally, the younger you are the more concerned you will be:

As a card-carrying member of Gen X, it is rather shaming to find that barely half of us think climate change is either very or extremely serious, given unlike our baby boomer parents our formative years saw increasing temperatures:

But it is not just age – political orientation is also a determinant.

Those who call themselves rightwing are much more likely to deny climate change:

But while this may not be surprising, given their news sources and the statements by rightwing politicians, what is more worrying is that just as many of those who class themselves as “centre” view climate change as merely “somewhat serious”, as do rightwingers.

This suggests a large gulf in the ability of the media to convey the issue’s importance to those with little political affiliation. When it comes to climate change, believing it is only “somewhat serious” essentially means you have not understood the problem.

And it is clear that the media is not getting the message through.

Only 38% of those with a “centre” political orientation believe the media provides “accurate information” on climate change:

We need to be a bit careful with these findings because while rightwingers are more likely to deny climate change, they are also more likely to believe the media is not telling the truth. So it is unclear whether those in the centre believe the media is exaggerating or underplaying the issue.

But while it is easy to lay all the blame at the feet of News Corp and those media organisations and journalists who choose to treat climate change as a debatable concept (or possibly a less than serious one) the report also points to the challenge for those of us in the media who agree with the science.

Over a quarter of those who only regard the issue as “somewhat serious” are disinterested in reading about climate change:

This is the challenge for organisations such as Guardian Australia, the ABC, and the Nine/Fairfax papers who do report on the issue with the seriousness it deserves. It is not enough to preach to the converted.

We need to reach those vaguely aware of the issue but not really informed well enough to understand its seriousness. Failure to do so will cede the issue to the climate-change denying media outlets, and will continue to have Australia with one of the highest numbers of deniers in the world.",mainstream
253,"As planet Earth took form, agglomerated from leftover debris surrounding the newborn sun, it settled into a rather remarkable position. Our home world, about 4.5 billion years old, happened to combine the right materials with the correct distance from our host star to blossom into a hospitable planet, covered in water, vegetation and roaming wildlife of all varieties.

For some 3.7 billion years, life and the planet continued to evolve together, entwined in a mutual ebb and flow of evolutionary creation and cataclysmic devastation. Temperature records—compiled from miles-long ice cores filled with preserved gas bubbles and the remains of unicellular ocean-dwellers—can be compared to the fossil record to help scientists fill in the timeline of Earth’s history. The Cambrian explosion, for example, some 541 million years ago, saw a proliferation of complex life in the world’s oceans, possibly brought about by an increase in oxygen. The Permian extinction 252 million years ago, sparked by a rapid increase in volcanic activity and CO2 in the atmosphere, wiped out some 90 percent of all marine species and 70 percent of terrestrial species.

The planet’s ebbs and flows continue today, with one notable additional variable: humans. For thousands of years, our species has manipulated the climate through agriculture, deforestation, herding and other land use. And in just the past 100 years or so, we’ve extracted and burned exorbitant amounts of fossil fuels in the forms of coal and oil—fuels that were largely created over millions of years as dead plankton and other organic material was buried under the seafloor. Powering our rails and our cars, our factories and our homes has released hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, mirroring large-scale carbon emission events of the distant, prehistoric past.

The result, as observed and confirmed by thousands and thousands of scientific papers, is a period of rapid global warming, unprecedented in geologic history. The graph above gives a sense of temperature changes over the past 20,000 years, with a major spike in the past century, and two projections of future temperatures for the next 3,000 years that depend on whether our species manages to curb its carbon emissions.

“The history of our planet has been marked by changes in temperature” as well as “the ever-throbbing drum of evolving organisms,” says Kirk Johnson, the director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. “But climate change is different.” Though the planet has been hot before—hotter than it is now—today’s rate of change has never been seen in the temperature record.

By examining the 400-million-year timeline of Earth’s climate history below, compared to the last 20,000 years, we may better understand the changes we are driving and the possible futures we face as a species—and as the only known planet of living beings.",mainstream
327,"If an infectious disease was killing 7 million people a year, it would be ludicrous to work to allay its impact decades from now rather than taking immediate action against it. Yet that is exactly how we are approaching the causes of climate change, which are both immediate and long-term killers.

This week’s “airpocalypse” in New Delhi shows just how urgently action is needed to prevent the air pollution that is not only damaging our planet and human health in the long term but killing millions of people around the world in the present.

As the United Nations Conference on Climate Change reconvenes in Marrakech, Morocco, many experts are concerned that little concrete progress has been made in the year since the Paris agreement was crafted on preventing an irreversible increase in global average temperature that will have catastrophic consequences in the future. This concern is given new impetus because of President-elect Donald Trump’s skepticism about climate change, his vow to cancel the Paris agreement, and his commitment to exploiting fossil fuels as energy sources.

Yet there is a daily catastrophe that adds urgency to the need to contain fossil fuel emissions and the burning of biomass: the enormous numbers of deaths due to air pollution.

Scientists who measure the burden of disease around the world have only recently appreciated the global scale of death and disability due to air pollution. The World Health Organization has estimated that in 2012 almost 1 in 8 of all global deaths — that translates into 7 million deaths — were due to indoor and outdoor air pollution. UNICEF has estimated that 300 million children around the world breathe toxic air and 600,000 die each year from air pollution.

These numbers are far greater than the number of deaths due to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. In addition to these deaths, air pollution causes immense disability through its contributions to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart disease and stroke. The grim death statistics also don’t include the hospitalizations, compromised lung function in children, premature births, and associated health care costs due to air pollution.

When it comes to climate change, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases get most of the attention. And though they certainly contribute to the immediate avalanche of death and disability, the biggest culprit is the very tiny particles in the air that also come from burning fossil fuels in power plants and automobile engines and in burning biomass to cook food, to heat homes, and to prepare fields for planting and clear land for cultivation.

Taking action to mitigate climate change would not only reduce the levels of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, but also would reduce emissions of the associated air pollutants — particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and more — that are directly harming human health today.

Why have we have underestimated the short-term health benefits of the climate change mitigation policies?

First, most of the cost-benefit analyses of climate change mitigation strategies project its harmful health impact decades from now. Surprisingly, they have not factored in the millions of lives that would be saved almost immediately as a result of reducing air pollution as well as limiting the occurrence of catastrophic weather-related events, such as heat waves, floods, blizzards, and forest fires.

Second, we initially thought that the steps to remove the larger, soot-like particles from fossil fuel emissions — the ones that caused smog events like the one that crippled London in 1952 — would be enough to eliminate the adverse health effects of fossil-fuel-related air pollution. Although removing larger particles from smokestack and tail pipe emissions has helped clear the skies in London and many other Western cities, we are coming to understand the health threat posed by even very low levels of smaller particles and their numerous chemical constituents.

These are called particulate matter 2.5, which refers to their size — under 2.5 microns in width, or about 20 times smaller than the width of a human hair. The smallest of these are so tiny that several thousand could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.

Third, the larger particles emitted by burning fossil fuels cause obvious damage to the lungs. Scientists initially thought that respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the chief consequences of air pollution. More recent data show that particulate matter 2.5 also increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Since these are major killers around the world, anything that increases their frequency has an outsize effect on premature death.

Finally, even as skies have become bluer in many developed countries, the “brown cloud” of air pollution has intensified rapidly along the east coast of China and in parts of India — some of the most densely populated regions of the world. Add in a new appreciation of the harmful health effects of indoor air pollution due to smoke from cooking fires, and air pollution has become one of the world’s major killers.

The steps needed to mitigate climate change in the future are substantially the same as those needed to reduce the burden of death and disability due to air pollution in the present — cut back on burning fossil fuels and biomass. In the dry terms of environmental economists, the enormous near-term health benefit of reducing these emissions is a “co-benefit” of climate change policies. Even climate change skeptics who deny the scale of future environmental impact should not tolerate of the millions of deaths currently caused by air pollution today.

This death and disability is not limited to other countries. Analyses of another program Trump has targeted for dismantling, the Clean Power Plan, project substantial short-term health benefits from controlling climate change in the US.

As the delegates in Marrakech continue their work, we ask them to also consider the urgency of the present. We also implore the incoming US administration to take stock of the health burdens of air pollution as they consider energy and environmental policies. Reducing air pollution is not only a matter of the future health of the planet, it is a matter of life and death in the here and now.

196,"As sea levels rise, the shore will creep inward. For coastal towns facing several feet of sea level rise, a change so big is hard to visualize. Now, a virtual reality start-up is trying to make it easier by creating simulations for residents to show how flooding will impact their neighborhoods.

The goal of the project, developed by start-up company Virtual Planet, ""is to start a conversation and help folks visualize the impacts [of climate change] and the solutions, and also discuss the trade-offs between them,” program developer Juliano Calil tells Nathan Rott at NPR.

Virtual Planet’s project was demonstrated at a Turner Station community meeting in Baltimore as part of consideration of a project that could make the peninsula more resilient against flooding. A proposed project would use dredged sediment from Baltimore Harbor and Chesapeake Bay to build up low-lying areas.

""We need the whole community on board with this,"" Gloria Nelson, president of Turner Station Conservation Teams, tells Rott. ""Rather than [an] agency coming to us and telling us: 'This is what we're going to do in your community.' ""

Virtual Planet is one way the project is seeking buy-in from the community. Once a user dons the virtual reality (VR) goggles, they can see an office space with their neighborhood’s topography miniaturized in the middle of the room. When prompted to look down, they see drone footage giving them a bird’s eye view of the city streets. There, they can apply a sliding scale of flooding, from spring 2019’s real high tide up to an extra six feet of water.

In Turner Station, the shoreline and nearby baseball fields will be the first things overtaken by rising sea levels, reports NPR. The community is located on a peninsula southeast of Baltimore, and the baseball fields are already unusable more often than not.

The start-up first exhibited the Sea Level Rise Explorer project in their hometown of Santa Cruz, California. As Jessica York reports for the Santa Cruz Sentinel, VR headsets were set up in the Santa Cruz Public Libraries downtown branch last week. The narrated VR experience lasts about seven minutes, and is available in both English and Spanish.

“It was quite realistic, especially the aerial view,” Santa Cruz resident Tim Robbins told York after watching the VR experience. “You really feel like you’re in this blimp. Even the tides we had last year were very close to infrastructure that was right on the ocean. So, I didn’t know that last year had that much water coming in like that.”

The next iteration of Virtual Planet’s presentation will focus on a strip of expensive beachside properties in Long Beach, California. Calil also hopes the visualizations will begin to integrate the effects of proposed solutions, like one project aimed to reinforce low-lying areas of Turner Station.

Calil tells NPR that if a city is considering a sea wall, for example, “we can show the sea wall and look at the impacts to the beach. You have a sea wall, but over time, you may lose the beach.""

581,"As the cost of storm Ciara starts to be counted, one Teesside based health care provider is reflecting on the impact of climate change on its ageing building infrastructure.

North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust was impacted by the reported 100 miles per hour storm at the weekend, costing the organisation a minimum £20k in estimated repairs.

The University Hospital of North Tees had to implement emergency measures in one ward in their 55-year-old buildings, and roof panels from the University Hospital Hartlepool were blown off during the severe storms last weekend.

Mike Worden, Managing Director for NTH Solutions, the Trust’s estates and facilities management company, explains more about the situation “The reality we face is that our infrastructure at both main sites in Hartlepool and Stockton is now significantly aged, they were built in the 1960s/70s and are now vulnerable to the ever increasing extremes of UK weather.

Our teams work tirelessly to maintain and provide the highest standard of facilities for our communities; but our creaking infrastructure means we are ever more vulnerable to effects of climate change.

Working with funding we have available at present, the Trust is investing as much as possible to address the estate issues but this investment alone cannot sustain the underlying issues”.

In 2011, HM Government issued their report Climate Resilient Infrastructure: Preparing for a Changing Climate’. The publication outlines the risks relating to climate change on ageing buildings, including flood risks and intense rainfall. Mike continues “The buildings and houses we work and live in today are not going to be ‘fit for purpose’ for future climate. The time to act is now”.

The Trust, in partnership with NTH Solutions, has established a climate change working group and has already had many of their ambitions for change realised. This has included the construction of their award winning state-of-the-art energy centre – which won Small Scale Project of the Year category at the Energy Efficiency Awards and also secured second place in the Solar PV Project of the Year category in 2019.

Mike explains ‘The new energy centre at North Tees is an award winning eco-success. Fundamentally, we have reduced our overall energy requirements which is a tangible benefit for all of us. Ultimately, whether fueled by fossil fuels or renewable energies we have to reduce our overall energy consumption and this initiative has allowed us to edge nearer to this ambition.

The centre’s solar PV panels have provided some £25,000 in electricity savings for the Trust in just 18-months. The centre is not only eco-friendly but due to the overall reduction in energy requirements it represents a fundamental efficiency for the Trust – which will eventually pay for the initial investment.

The resolve that both NTH Solutions and the Trust have for addressing climate change issues has meant that we have an ever growing work plan of environmentally responsible initiatives from reducing single use plastics and zero landfill waste disposal to progressively replacing our vehicle fleet with electric vehicles and the implementation of electric charging points for both staff and patients”.

However, he concludes, “owing to their age, and despite the dedication of our teams and the resolve of the leadership to address the issues, our buildings are fundamentally vulnerable. This inevitably means there is going to be an increasing impact on the people who use our facilities”.

Julie Gillon, Chief Executive for North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust added ‘we have been exceptionally innovative in the way in which we have used our infrastructure in recent years, including the increase in services at our important site in Hartlepool. Our population has a diverse range of complex health needs. We need to ensure that our buildings reflect our continued ambitions to provide outstanding health care to the population of the Tees Valley”.",mainstream

More than 100 bushfires are raging in Australia as the continent swelters under record heat, a double whammy of extremes that has amplified scrutiny of what experts say is stark inaction from the government on climate change.

Blazes across New South Wales and Queensland have scorched almost 7 million acres, and Australia experienced its hottest day on record Wednesday, when the average temperature across the country hit 105 degrees.

The nation's woes are unfolding as Australia faces criticism for what have been described as its inadequate climate policies, including the role of federal officials in thwarting negotiations at a recent U.N. summit on climate change.

Richie Merzian, director of the climate and energy program at the Australia Institute, a Canberra-based think tank that conducts public policy research, called the 2019 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change a letdown. The summit ended Sunday in a stalemate, with countries largely delaying major decisions on plans to cut carbon emissions until next year's conference.

""It was terribly disappointing,"" Merzian said. ""Australia is literally on fire right now, and it's clearly linked to climate change in terms of its severity and duration. But instead of going there to rally the world behind the need for greater climate action, Australia was lobbying to do as little as possible.""

Seasonal bushfires occur naturally in Australia, but hotter and drier conditions due to climate change have increased the frequency of fires and their severity, said Andy Pitman, a climate modeler at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

""There is an uncontroversial link whereby higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere from climate change increase bushfire risk,"" Pitman said. ""All other things being equal, a fire that occurs now will be worse than a fire that occurred 20 to 30 years ago.""

Trees play an integral role in the planet's carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide as they grow. But research has shown that when vegetation dries out — as during hot and dry summer months — the increased amount of carbon dioxide acts as extra fuel for wildfires.

Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, release greenhouse gases that trap heat and raise surface temperatures. A 2018 State of the Climate report from the Australian government's Bureau of Meteorology found that the country has warmed by just over 1 degree Celsius since 1910, ""leading to an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events.""

Those heat waves, combined with dry conditions, are dangerous ingredients for bushfires, Pitman said, with circumstances appearing to be particularly severe at the moment.

""This is unprecedented,"" Pitman said. ""I don't think we've ever seen bushfires at this scale before.""

Bushfires are also problematic because they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Australia's fires are estimated to have emitted 250 million tons of carbon dioxide already — nearly half of the nation's total yearly average emissions — according to NASA data provided to The Guardian.

Those events have renewed focus on Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, who has refused to answer questions about climate change and their link to the fires. His conservative administration has also faced backlash for its policies and rhetoric surrounding global warming.

In November, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said climate change concerns were stoked by ""raving inner-city lefties,"" adding that there had been fires in Australia ""since time began.""

Pitman said that while there had been some progress made on the state level, the federal government had shown a lack of political will.

""They almost see it as a negotiating or debating point, and it's not,"" Pitman said. ""This is an existential risk to communities and major regions of the planet, and if governments don't act, then the situation will simply deteriorate.""

Imran Ahmad, a climate scientist at Australian National University, said the Morrison administration's stance was symptomatic of Australia's complex history of climate change policy.

""There is an ideological drive against climate change by certain vested interests,"" he said.

Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and its third-largest exporter of fossil fuels, after Russia and Saudi Arabia. Merzian, who worked as a climate negotiator for the government for almost a decade, said those economic ties have shaped the country's climate policies for decades — and invite international criticism.

""You can't be the largest exporter of coal, which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions when consumed, and not take any responsibility for that,"" Merzian said.

In 2012, Australia's Labor Government introduced a carbon tax that helped the country reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 1.4 percent by the end of its second year. But the policy was unpopular, and in 2014, the newly elected government repealed the tax.

""Any new tax is unpopular, but unfortunately, by the time it was dismantled, we could see that it was working,"" Merzian said. ""It was reducing emissions, but it just didn't have enough momentum to survive quite a strong negative campaign.""

As one of the countries that ratified the 2015 Paris Agreement, a global pact aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, Australia will join 187 other countries in pledging to meet its reduction goals next year. Pitman said Australia has much at stake, with fragile ecosystems, such as the Great Barrier Reef, under severe threat from warming oceans and the country's bushfires. Still, he added, it's difficult to be optimistic about the country's direction.

""The Great Barrier Reef is a multibillion-dollar asset to Australia, and it's being sacrificed at the altar of carbon dioxide emissions,"" he said. ""It's really important to understand that decisions that need to be made on carbon emission are politically painful, and there is no one more skilled at avoiding difficult political decisions than politicians.""",mainstream
1176,"Climate change might hit us in the most vital place of all  the dinner plate. Why do we care about climate change? Obviously we worry about what warming temperatures might do to the geography of the planet  particularly melting polar ice and raising global sea levels. We fear the impact that climate change could have on endangered species, as warming temperatures speed the already rapid pace of extinction for wildlife that have been pushed to the edge by habitat loss and hunting. We focus on the changing risk of extreme weather, of more powerful storms causing billions of dollars of damage in richer nations  and taking thousands of lives in poorer ones. Sometimes we're simply uneasy with idea that our actions are altering the earth, changing the rhythms of the seasons, shifting weather patterns we've been accustomed to for as long as human beings can remember.

All of that is important  but not as important as the impact that climate change might have on the most vital function of any species: feeding itself. The human population broke the 7 billion mark late last year, and the reason that happened  and the reason we can and will keep growing, barring major changes  is that we've become amazingly proficient at raising food. Our distribution is far from perfect  which is the reason the world is simultaneously home to 1 billion hungry and more than 300 million obese people  and the side effects of large-scale farming can damage the environment. But food production still remains humanity's most amazing accomplishment.

That's why the threat that climate change could mess with agriculture is so scary  and why experts are worried that we're not stepping up to the challenge. In last week's Science, an international group of leading investigators  led by John Beddington, the chief science adviser for the British government  published a call urging policymakers to ensure that agriculture becomes a more vital part of global action against climate change. ""Global agriculture must produce more food to feed a growing population,"" they write. ""Yet scientific assessments point to climate change as a growing threat to agricultural yields and food security."" In other words, the potential risks to farming are one more reason we need to reduce carbon emissions soon  and the fact that the climate is already changing, and will continue to change, means that we also need to start adapting agriculture to a warmer world immediately.

How exactly could climate change diminish our ability to feed ourselves? Warming alone could do it, with already hot and dry parts of the world  like the American Southwest or the Horn of Africa  predicted to become hotter and drier still. The catastrophic droughts that have gripped Texas and East Africa  leading to a devastating famine in the latter case  this past summer are likely signs of things to come. (And it's not just climate change that should cause us worry there: both regions have a history of megadroughts in the geologic past, before they were widely settled by human beings, which means even the norm may be drier than we think.) While additional carbon in the air may help some plants, warmer temperatures can also retard growth, so extreme heat could lead to greater crop loss.

It's not just drought, though; rain at the wrong time can be disastrous for agriculture as well. That much was obvious during the relentless floods in Pakistan in 2010, which not only killed thousands of Pakistanis but also washed away crops. Those losses helped drive food prices to record highs during the past year  a level from which they're only now beginning to drop. As the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture, which means we can expect heavier storms when the rain does fall. Pakistan, too, could be a harbinger of a warmer future.

Warming isn't the only threat to our ability to feed ourselves  it acts in concert with rising population, the growing demand for grain and water-intensive meat, and the civil dysfunction and conflict that often frustrates poor farmers in the developing world. (The ongoing famine in Somalia has as much to do with the civil war there as it does with drought.) That's why scientists are calling for more integrated research as the first step to adapting agriculture to climate change, to ensure that farmers know what's coming  and that they can prepare for it.

No answer will fit all agricultural ecosystems. Problems and solutions will be different in rich countries and poor ones; cool, damp ones; and hot, dry ones. ""There are clearly major opportunities this year for scientists to provide the evidence required to rapidly generate new investments and policies that will ensure agriculture can adapt to the impact of climate change,"" says Bob Scholes of South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, who was a co-author of the Science paper.

Smart climate adaptation will also cost money  money that rich nations can spare, but that poor countries, which already face the brunt of climate change, likely can't. If there's one area on which policymakers in the climate arena should focus their effort, it's ensuring that developing nations have the funds  and the expertise  needed to keep feeding themselves as the globe warms. ""The window of opportunity to avert a humanitarian, environmental and climate crisis is rapidly closing, and we need better information and tools for managing the trade-offs in how we grow our food and use our resources,"" says Molly Jahn, dean of the University of Wisconsin-Madison's College of Agricultural and Life Sciences and another author of the Science article. If we hope to thrive in a warmer world  one that's coming  we have no other choice.

1161,"We know the warnings by now.

2019 is on course to be in the top three warmest years on record.

And now, UN Secretary General António Guterres says the ""point of no return is no longer over the horizon"".

That came ahead of the UN's two-week gathering of countries to discuss climate change and set targets - the 25th Conference of the Parties (COP25).

So what really gets done at these conferences - and do they actually work?

Many countries have individual targets related to climate change.

For example, the UK government has committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions right down to net-zero by 2050.

But there are also worldwide targets for countries which take part in the UN climate change summits.

The Montreal Protocol, adopted in 1987, was an international agreement to try to heal the ozone layer, which protects Earth from ultraviolet rays but was being destroyed by man-made chemicals.

By last year it was found to be successfully healing - the Northern Hemisphere could be fully fixed by the 2030s and Antarctica by the 2060s, according to a UN report.

The COP meetings - which focus on greenhouse gases - started in 1995. But it was 1997 when the first significant targets were set.

The Kyoto Protocol, agreed in Japan in 1997, set targets for 37 countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

The targets were different for each country, depending on how developed they were.

But the US pulled out in 2001 - because they were unhappy that developed countries had legally binding targets, while less developed nations didn't have binding targets.

Canada pulled out in 2011 and a lot of other countries missed their targets.

In 2012, the Kyoto Protocol was updated in Doha, Qatar.

But the deal only covered Europe and Australia, whose share of world greenhouse gas emissions was less than 15%.

However, it paved the way for the Paris Agreement in 2015 - also known as COP21 - which was another significant step in climate change talks.

The Paris Agreement went further than any other international climate change deal.

It was agreed by 195 countries in 2015 and came into force in November 2016.

Some of the main pledges were:
• To keep global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C.
• To limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100.
• To review each country's contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge.
• For rich countries to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy.

One of the main differences to the Paris deal was that it allowed countries to submit their own targets - rather than tell countries what their targets were.

This got the US and Canada back on board.

But since then, the US has started to withdraw from the agreement, as President Trump says it's unfair on the US economy.

He has said he wants to make it easier for fossil fuel producers in the US.

But there's an election in the US in November 2020, and a different president could cancel the withdrawal.

Do the talks actually work?

Although the Paris Agreement was generally well-received, the UN itself has said it doesn't go far enough.

A report from the UN Environment Programme in 2017 says the Paris Agreement only covers a third of the emission reductions needed.

It says that the world is still on course to warm by more than 2C.

The report recommends putting more ambitious targets in place in 2020.

Next year's targets are what's expected to be discussed at this year's COP25 in Madrid.

The 2020 summit will be held in Glasgow and countries have committed to submit new and updated national climate action plans.

The UN Secretary General António Guterres will tell the meeting that the world is now facing a full-blown climate emergency.

He said before the conference: ""In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.""

It could be seen as an acknowledgement that while the climate change summits can be a step towards a better future, more needs to be done - and time is running out.

1128,"The recent UN global warming conference under auspices of the deceptively-named International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded its meeting in South Korea discussing how to drastically limit global temperature rise. Mainstream media is predictably retailing various panic scenarios “predicting” catastrophic climate change because of man-made emissions of Greenhouse Gases, especially CO2, if drastic changes in our lifestyle are not urgently undertaken. There is only one thing wrong with all that. It’s based on fake science and corrupted climate modelers who have reaped by now billions in government research grants to buttress the arguments for radical change in our standard of living. We might casually ask “What’s the point?” The answer is not positive.

The South Korea meeting of the UN IPCC discussed measures needed, according to their computer models, to limit global temperature rise tobelow 1.5 Centigrade above levels of the pre-industrial era. One of the panel members and authors of the latest IPCC Special Report on Global Warming, Drew Shindell, at Duke University told the press that to meet the arbitrary 1.5 degree target will require world CO2 emissions to drop by a staggering 40% in the next 12 years. The IPCC calls for a draconian “zero net emissions” of CO2 by 2050. That would mean complete ban on gas or diesel engines for cars and trucks, no coal power plants, transformation of the world agriculture to burning food as biofuels. Shindell modestly put it, “These are huge, huge shifts.”

The new IPCC report, SR15, declares that global warming of 1.5°C will “probably“ bring species extinction, weather extremes and risks to food supply, health and economic growth. To avoid this the IPCC estimates required energy investment alone will be $2.4 trillion per year. Could this explain the interest of major global banks, especially in the City of London in pushing the Global Warming card?

This scenario assumes an even more incredible dimension as it is generated by fake science and doctored data by a tight-knit group of climate scientists internationally that have so polarized scientific discourse that they label fellow scientists who try to argue as not mere global warming skeptics, but rather as “Climate Change deniers.” What does that bit of neuro-linguistic programming suggest? Holocaust deniers? Talk about how to kill legitimate scientific debate, the essence of true science. Recently the head of the UN IPCC proclaimed, “The debate over the science of climate change is well and truly over.”

What the UN panel chose to ignore was the fact the debate was anything but “over.” The Global Warming Petition Project, signed by over 31,000 American scientists states, “There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.”

The most interesting about the dire warnings of global catastrophe if dramatic changes to our living standards are not undertaken urgently, is that the dire warnings are always attempts to frighten based on future prediction. When the “tipping point” of so-called irreversibility is passed with no evident catastrophe, they invent a new future point.

953,"‘No Other President Has Had the Gall’: Environmental Groups Balk as Trump Proposes Major Rollback of Infrastructure Review Process

President Donald Trump proposed one of his most aggressive environmental rollbacks yet on Thursday, announcing a change that would exempt federal agencies from considering the climate impacts of pipelines and other infrastructure projects.

The president’s proposal would significantly limit enforcement of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which mandates that federal agencies consider how proposed construction projects like pipelines, highways and dams would impact land, air, water and wildlife, The Associated Press explained. NEPA also gives the public a say in the review process. The law was signed by Richard Nixon in 1971 following national outrage over the 1969 oil spill off Santa Barbara, California. Along with the Clean Air and Water Acts, it is one of the bedrock environmental laws of the last half century.

Trump, who announced the proposed changes Thursday at the White House surrounded by men in hard hats and safety vests, argued that the law as currently enforced delays important projects with needless bureaucracy.

However, conservation groups warn the changes will benefit fossil fuel companies and other polluting industries at the expense of the environment, the climate and the communities most at risk from the fallout.

So what exactly is Trump proposing to change?

The new regulations would set deadlines for how long a review of a project can take: one year for smaller projects and two years for larger ones, The New York Times explained.

White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Mary Neumayr told NPR that the average environmental impact statement currently takes four and a half years to complete, and the average for highways takes seven years, a delay that “deprives Americans of the benefits of modernized bridges and roads that enable them to get home to their families,” she said. But environmental groups argue that two years is too tight for a thorough review.

The regulations get rid of the requirement that agencies consider the cumulative impact of new projects. This is the requirement courts have pointed to in mandating that agency reviews include an assessment of how a project will contribute to the climate crisis, The New York Times explained. Neumayr said the new rules would not prevent agencies from considering the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, but they also would not require them to do so. Under the new regulations, NPR explained, agencies would have to consider the impacts of building a pipeline, but not the impacts of the oil or gas it would transport.

The new regulations would also decrease the number of projects subject to review altogether, NPR reported. “Non-federal” projects receiving limited government money would be exempt, for example. The changes would also let private companies conduct their own reviews.

Indeed, legal experts agree it may not. The Trump administration has attempted almost 100 environmental rollbacks since taking office, according to The New York Times. But it has also been sued almost 70 times to stop attempts at deregulation and only won four times.

Legal scholars agree there is a good chance Trump’s changes to how NEPA is applied won’t stand up in court.

The proposed changes will be published on the federal register Friday and will be followed by a 60-day public comment period, according to The New York Times. There will also be two public hearings before the final changes are enshrined, probably in the fall.",conspiracy
492,"Climate change is scary. Talking about it productively doesn't have to be.

Climate change remains one of the most controversial topics in America, with people resolutely divided along partisan battle lines. As fires rage tragically across Australia, flame wars flicker here, too, as we struggle to engage in meaningful discourse about climate change.

But better conversations are not only possible, they’re also relatively easy to bring about. The key is to change the script from the way the dialogue normally takes place:

1. Abandon the talking points. Many exchanges on climate change follow a depressingly familiar playbook. Memes, stale talking points and insults are lobbed at all who dare disagree. This drumbeat of acrimony is all around us: in the news media, among our political leaders and within our own communities. The first step is to avoid that dead end. When you encounter a talking point, resist the urge to fire back. Instead, take a deep breath and try to figure out what lies underneath the rhetoric.

2. Listening is the most underused and powerful communication skill. The quickest way to strengthen your own conversational effectiveness is simple but counterintuitive: Be quiet and be curious. Ask questions, listen to the answers and ask follow-ups. As you dig beyond the talking points, you can establish an entirely different type of conversation. Meanwhile, listening builds trust and sets the stage for deeper engagement.

3. Recognize the places of agreement. Persuading someone to adopt your values and worldview is basically impossible. Instead, look for the places where your values are already aligned. This becomes easy once you pause to listen, because most of us have more in common than we realize. For example, does anyone want more pollution in the world? Is anyone in favor of being left behind in the global transition to a modern energy system? Do we think it’s fair for corporations to pollute for free, while wielding outsize influence over the rules that protect public health? Probably not. Use this common ground to explore how we can work toward mutual goals.

4. The most robust solutions come from a wide constituency. No one has all the answers. We should be vigorously debating climate change, as long as we direct the discussion to ways to confront it. Broad perspectives — from liberals and conservatives, youthful and experienced, bold and cautious — are all needed to hone enduring solutions. Invite ideas and aspirations from those who don’t see the world the way you do, and you’re likely to hash out a richer dialogue than you’d have with like-minded friends.

5. Focus on immediate, common benefits. Not everyone cares about polar bears or coral reefs. Distant problems, no matter how dire, don’t feel as important as the here and now. But you don’t even have to mention climate change while having a conversation about solving it. Instead, talk about reducing pollution, improving public health, maximizing energy efficiency and leveraging American competitiveness. Those are fairly universal values that win easy support.

Talking it out: Learning to discuss complicated issues ahead of the election

We want to hear from you: Be a part of the solution to finding solutions. Tell us here.

Similarly, local actions and solutions can be less polarizing than high-level problems that seem intractable. The shuttering of an aging coal-fired power plant presents a tough transition for a community, but it also invites connecting over common goals. We all want jobs, relevance and a secure future. What paths offer our best shot at getting there?

Climate change is an awful problem that’s hard to confront. But many of the solutions offer widespread benefits, and a note of optimism can make your message more effective.

6. Learn as much as you can, then keep learning. If someone incorrectly claims that volcanoes pump out more carbon dioxide than humans do, you don’t need to get mad. Instead, leverage the misconception as an opening to talk about how the scale of human pollution overwhelms the pace of natural processes. The more you know, the easier it is to keep things productive, and the less likely you’ll get defensive.

Candidates on climate change:Review how the presidential contenders would address the global challenge.

7. The first step toward solving problems is accepting them. A small (but vocal) segment of the population insists that climate change is not an actual problem, or that there is no need to change our century-old ways of generating energy. Those positions are untenable, and people who have dug in their heels have unfortunately guaranteed their own irrelevance. If you want to have your voice heard, bring your ideas and concerns to the table, listen more than you speak, and then you’ll have a much better chance at becoming part of the conversation.

8.Try it! Venturing into a potentially difficult discussion can be intimidating. But if you start by seeking common ground, you can help bust the trend of endless bickering. Lead with your own example, treat others with respect, and you may be pleasantly surprised that it’s not impossible to make progress after all.

In the thirty years since, those projections of what would happen in a warming world have proven to be remarkably prescient.

“We’ve already observed some of the things we expected in 1989,” said Susan Fischer Wilhelm, a research manager at the California Energy Commission, the agency that compiled the report.

The assessment laid the groundwork for what has arguably become the country’s most ambitious effort to address global warming.

But to many who worked on the report, looking back on it now only underscores how long we’ve waited to act — and how much time has been wasted.

“I felt a sense of pride of being able to participate in something like this, but also a sense of regret for us as a society,” said Les Baxter, who worked on the report as a policy analyst at the CEC and is now vice president of program strategy for the Pew Charitable Trusts.

“We’ve known what we need to do and we just keep refusing to do it.”

The report might have remained lost to history if Gary Estes hadn’t been going through boxes in his garage last year and stumbled upon a copy.

For decades, Estes has organized the annual California Extreme Precipitation Symposium. And he decided to use this year’s meeting as an opportunity to look back at the 185-page report.

“I thought it would be an appropriate thing to do 30 years later,” said Estes, a citizen activist and self-described “energy nut.”

The symposium, held this week at UC Davis, brought together university and government scientists to discuss report’s findings.

Its state-specific projections were drawn from scientific studies and assessments by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that were released in the late 1980s, as well as from detailed analyses conducted by state agencies.

“I was impressed with the level of rigor that they were able to bring,” said Wilhelm, who gave a presentation at the symposium outlining what we knew then and what we know now.

The report explained that doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would raise temperatures in California by roughly 3 degrees Celsius — which will happen by mid-century if emissions continue to rise, according to the most recent California Climate Change Assessment.

Then, as now, climate models showed no clear change in the state’s average annual precipitation. But the authors noted that 3 degrees of warming would reduce the area of mountain snow cover by half. And it would increase the frequency and severity of winter floods, as more water fell as rain instead of snow. (Both changes have already started to occur, Wilhelm said.)

In contrast, spring runoff would drop by a third. (They’ve already fallen over the last century, Wilhelm said.)

The authors added that, although there was still debate among scientists at the time, climate change could also bring more variable weather.

The report outlined the ways in which changes in the seasonal pattern of precipitation would pose problems for the state’s reservoirs, which would have to release water during the rainy season to avoid overflowing. (That’s exactly what happened in the the 2017 Oroville Dam crisis.)

In the summer, water shortages would impact ecosystems, farmers and hydropower production, the authors wrote. Heat and drought would stress forests, which would likely “experience lower growth and higher susceptibility to fires, insects, and disease.” (This, too, has come to pass.)

The report also warned that climate change would raise sea level, increase electricity demand, worsen air quality, increase heat-related deaths and be a drain on the state’s economy.

“It strikes me that we were right on,” said Kari Smith, now a division manager at the San Jose Clean Energy department who helped oversee the report when she worked at the CEC. “I don’t think there was anything that we said that is radically off-base.”

If anything, she said, the report underestimated the degree to which climate impacts are interrelated. For instance, in 1989, few foresaw that wildfire risk would cause utilities to consider cutting power to thousands of residents, jeopardizing the reliability of electricity.

The report came about after the legislature asked the CEC to assess “the effect of global warming trends on California’s energy, economy, environment, agriculture, and water.”

Soon after, the CEC released the state’s first inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 and a set of climate policy recommendations in 1991.

AB 4420, the 1988 bill that mandated the reports, was introduced by Byron Sher, a Stanford law professor and state politician best known for authoring California’s clean air and safe drinking water acts.

Global warming had just begun to seep into the public consciousness. Alarmed by signs of environmental change and the results of early climate models, scientists were going public with their concerns about what many then called the “greenhouse effect.”

Sher immediately saw the threat to California.

“The heat is on,” he told the Sacramento Bee in 1989. “The state can either ignore what science is telling us or we can respond to this challenge in a responsible way.”

Sher’s bill was part of a flurry of bipartisan political activity on climate change across the country. In his 1988 presidential campaign, George H.W. Bush vowed to combat the greenhouse effect with “the White House effect.”

In Congress, Democrats and Republicans introduced more than a dozen bills to curb atmospheric pollution. Several called for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 20% below 1988 levels by the year 2000. (Around the same time, the world agreed to phase out ozone-destroying substances under an agreement that President Reagan helped negotiate.)

By comparison, AB 4420 was relatively modest, said Kip Lipper, who was Sher’s chief of staff and helped draft the bill.

But AB 4420 had the distinction of actually passing. (The assembly voted 58 to 13 in favor of the bill; the senate voted 38-0.

“It’s the first law enacted anywhere in the United States that used the term ‘global warming,’” said Lipper, who still serves as the chief policy advisor for energy and environment to the president pro tem of the state senate.

Lipper said the report didn’t make a big splash. But it did provide a basis for everything that came later, including the state’s renewable energy portfolio standard and its cap-and-trade program.

“We tried to seed the ground, if you will, by saying, ‘Let’s just get a report. Let’s have this task force look at this,” he said.

It would be 12 years before the next piece of climate legislation passed. And AB 32 — which set the state’s first emissions reduction target — didn’t become law until 2006.

The reasons for the slow response are familiar: the daunting scope of climate change, the challenges of transitioning away from fossil fuels, and tenacious opposition by industry.

But many say there was also uncertainty about the reality of climate change in the 1980s.

While the report found that global warming posed a significant risk to California, it also acknowledged that the matter wasn’t entirely settled. In fact, the authors devoted six pages to “Challenges to the Global Warming Concept.”

Baxter felt that the theory was solid, but that there wasn’t enough evidence that it was happening yet.

“I remember thinking to myself, ‘Well, we’ll know enough in 20 or 25 years,’” he said.

Such reservations made it hard for politicians to push for action, even if they cared deeply about global warming, Smith said. “It was difficult to lead with climate change for a long time because it was considered maybe a little radical.”

Instead, leaders looked for ways to get at climate mitigation by focusing on other objectives, like improving air quality and energy efficiency.

That was a start, but not enough to tackle the problem, she said.

Today, scientists have no doubts about climate change and Californians see the impacts all around them.

“We now have observed data — not projections, nothing speculative — to show climate-related trends that are already affecting the state in ways that were anticipated 30 years ago,” Wilhelm said.

Indeed, if the report’s authors erred in any way, it was that they didn’t anticipate just how fast these changes would occur.

“They thought that we had at least 100 years before it became existential,” Smith said.

“Now, 30 years later, we’re recognizing that it all happened a lot more quickly than we anticipated.”",mainstream
1076,"Proposals by the European Union to establish a ""carbon border tax"" will stymie the global community's willingness to take joint action against climate change, China said on Wednesday.

The EU's new climate commissioner Frans Timmermans said in October that research would begin on the new tax, which is aimed at protecting European firms from unfair competition by raising the cost of products from countries that fail to take adequate action against climate change.
• China pledges new impetus in climate efforts after 2020
• As most countries cut back on coal, China is burning more of it

At a briefing on Wednesday, Zhao Yingmin, China's vice environment minister warned Europe's proposals, together with the decision by US President Donald Trump to withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement, would seriously harm international efforts to tackle global warming.

""We need to send a strong political signal to uphold multilateralism,"" he said. ""We need to prevent unilateralism and protectionism from hurting global growth expectations and the will of countries to combat climate change together.""

Any border tax would probably increase the price of Chinese goods in the European market, and Beijing believes it would violate a core principle of the Paris agreement on climate change, which says richer countries should bear the greater responsibility for cutting emissions.

As part of its national commitments to the fight against global warming, China - the world's largest emitter of climate-warming greenhouse gas - has pledged to bring its emissions to a peak by ""around 2030"".

It has also cut levels of carbon intensity - the amount produced per unit of economic growth - by 48.5 percent from 2005 to 2018, two years before schedule, Zhao said.

But the United States says the Paris accord is unfair to US firms because it does not do enough to tackle emissions from competitors in China and India.

China's total annual emissions stood at approximately 14 gigatonnes in 2018, according to a study published by the United Nations this week, more than twice the US level. China's per capita emissions are about the same as Japan and the European Union.

China was also making progress on its long-awaited efforts to build a nationwide carbon-trading platform, Li Gao, head of the climate change office at the environment ministry, told the briefing, although he did not give a timeframe.

China pledged to launch the platform in 2017 as part of its Paris commitments, but it has faced a series of technical difficulties.",mainstream
840,"""Climate change and sustainability were not easy topics back then,"" remembers Hanno Franke, thinking back almost 25 years and almost sounding as if he’s trying to defend himself.

The SC Freiburg marketing director has been at the club since the mid-1990s, a time when the Sport-Club from the Black Forest became the first Bundesliga club to begin taking measures to protect the environment.

""The club wasn’t sure of its own identity, its own DNA,"" Franke explains. ""But even then, the city of Freiburg took sustainability very seriously so it seemed logical that we as a football club should get involved as well. Many people advised us against it. Back then, some of our advisers warned us about being 'too green.'""

One of the main ideas was the installation of solar panels on the roof of the Schwarzwaldstadion’s new south stand (pictured above). It's common measure by today's standards, with many Bundesliga clubs producing their own solar energy, but in the mid-1990s, Freiburg were ahead of the curve and faced stiff opposition.

""Looking back, the club showed a great deal of courage and conviction and laid the groundwork for everything that followed,"" says Franke, with barely concealable pride.

Today, all Bundesliga clubs are aware of their environmental responsibilities, which can be divided into four main areas: traffic and emissions, waste, water and energy. But it's taken some clubs longer than others, with some only becoming ""greener"" when environmentally friendly measures also allowed them to save money.

""For a long time, environmental protection didn't play a role in football at all,"" says Thomas Fischer of the Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), a German environmental and consumer-protection agency that carries out regular surveys of Bundesliga clubs. ""But those days are over.""

However, Fischer still thinks more can be done.

""Clubs are great at implementing green policies when they don't require any investment in infrastructure, such as using green energy or installing LED lights which save energy.""

In recent years, clubs have begun to expand their climate protection portfolios more or less off their own backs, or in cooperation with local businesses. In March 2019, the 36 professional clubs in Germany’s top three leagues came together to discuss environmental solutions, but there is still no central coordination through the German Football League (DFL).

""The Bundesliga is still lacking a general climate plan,"" laments Fischer, who would like to see clubs pool their activities for climate protection. ""The DFL needs to set environmental targets and provide instructions and guidelines to help clubs implement concrete measures."" No such guidelines currently exist and the DFL is yet to respond to questions sent by DW.

In some areas, clubs are already implementing a number of measures to help protect the environment. They reduce waste by separating materials and serving drinks in recyclable cups, they save energy by installing solar panels or using LED lighting and they save water by gathering rain water for pitch irrigation and providing water-saving toilet facilities. But emissions created by travel to and from the matches remain a problem.

According to a study conducted by the climate advisory agency C02OL on behalf of German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk, football fans produce around 7,800 tons of harmful emissions per matchday. It would take 60,000 newly planted trees to compensate for that amount of C02, or over two million per season, and that's before flights to further-flung away games are taken into consideration.

In the north of Germany, Bundesliga side Werder Bremen are setting an example with an ""anti-automobile"" traffic concept. ""In Bremen, fans can travel to the stadium on a ferry along the River Weser,"" explains Fischer. ""What's more, cars are banned from approaching the stadium or from parking there.""

This reduces the amount of C02 being released into the air around the stadium. Fischer is still critical however of clubs such as Mainz and Hoffenheim who bill themselves as being ""carbon neutral.""

""Ultimately, they achieve this by buying climate certificates,"" opines Fischer. “It’s not too far away from the selling of indulgences."" In Hoffenheim's defense, the club compensates for its C02 emissions by running a reforestation program in Uganda in central Africa. ""But that doesn’t solve any waste or emissions problems in Hoffenheim itself,"" criticizes Fischer.

Back in Freiburg, the local club is dealing with local problems. SC Freiburg cooperate with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) on nature-protection projects in the Black Forest, the woodland which dominates the region. The project involves regularly educating local children and teenagers about climate change and how they can live more environmentally friendly lives.

Club employees are trained as well. Even when, after 25 years of experience, Freiburg are considered an ""industry leader"" in environmentally friendly football, there is still much to learn and the club remains open to new ideas.

""More and more organizations and campaigns are getting in touch with us because of our reputation which we have built up since the 1990s,"" says Hanno Frenke, who is particularly pleased about the number of young people who approach the club with their own questions and feedback.

""We had the organizers of the Freiburg branch of 'Fridays for Future' for a visit, for instance,"" he says. ""And of course we supported them – out of conviction.""",mainstream
374,"Former economy minister Emmanuel Macron was elected president of France in 2017, making him the youngest president in the country's history.

Born in 1977 in northern France, Emmanuel Macron attended a series of elite schools before joining the French Finance Ministry in 2004. Following a four-year stint at an investment bank, he joined President François Hollande's staff in 2012, eventually becoming minister of economy, industry and digital data. After forming the centrist En Marche! party in 2016, Macron became a surprising frontrunner in the presidential race. He defeated National Front leader Marine Le Pen in May 2017 to become, at age 39, the youngest president in French history.

Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron was born on December 21, 1977, in Amiens, France. The eldest child of two doctors, Macron distinguished himself with his intellect at an early age, displaying an aptitude for literature, politics and theater.

After attending the local Jesuit school La Providence, Macron completed his high school education at the prestigious Lycée Henri IV in Paris. He went on to study philosophy at Nanterre University and public affairs at Sciences Po, before graduating from the elite École Nationale d’Administration (ENA) in 2004.

After graduation, Macron went to work for the French Finance Ministry as an inspector. Forging powerful connections, he was tapped by President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 to join the bipartisan Attali Commission on economic growth.

The following year, Macron left civil service for the world of investment banking at Rothschild & Co. Again demonstrating a capacity for quick learning, he rose through the ranks to become managing director, earning renown for his role in advising Nestlé's $12 billion acquisition of a division of Pfizer in 2012.

Having already developed a relationship with Socialist Party leader François Hollande, Macron became deputy secretary-general at the Elysée when Hollande was elected France's president in 2012. Tasked with economic and financial matters, he handled an early challenge by helping to broker a compromise with Germany over the ongoing eurozone crisis.

In 2014, Macron was named France's minister of economy, industry and digital data. The following year, he formulated a collection of deregulatory measures to aid the economy, but after some 200 hours of parliamentary debates, the government invoked a little-used clause to bypass the chamber and ram through what became known as ""Macron's Law.""

Reportedly disillusioned with the governmental procedure, and said to be at increasing odds with Hollande, Macron in 2016 formed a new centrist party called En Marche! In August, he announced he was stepping down from his role as economy minister.

In November 2016, Macron formally announced his candidacy for the 2017 presidential election. Despite having no experience as an elected official, he captured support from both the left and the right through his proposals to lower corporate and housing taxes, reform welfare and pensions and devote resources to defense, energy, the environment and transportation.

Aided by favorable media coverage and the stumbles of more experienced opponents, the 39-year-old surged to the front of the polls. The conclusion of the first round of voting on April 23 saw him finish first, ahead of Marine Le Pen of the National Front, marking the first time since the formation of the French Fifth Republic in 1958 that none of the traditional right-left parties were represented in the final round.

The presidential runoff presented a stark contrast for the electorate, with Macron espousing free trade and a strong European Union and Le Pen seizing the tide of nationalism that had swept her once controversial party into the mainstream.

Shortly before the official close of campaigning on May 5, Macron's team announced that their candidate had been subjected to a ""massive and coordinated hacking operation"" that resulted in personal and business documents posted to a file-sharing site. However, the data dump seemed to have little impact on the election; when the votes were tallied on May 7, Macron had garnered more than 66 percent to decisively beat Le Pen, making him the youngest president in French history.

Among other issues, President Macron faced a restructuring of regional powers following the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union, as well as U.S. President Donald Trump's reshuffling of American interests. Shortly after the French election, Trump announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, prompting Macron to offer France as a ""second homeland"" to climate researchers in order to ""make our planet great again.""

In December 2017, President Macron awarded long-term research grants to 18 climate scientists — 13 of whom were previously based in the U.S. — to relocate to France and continue their work.

Climate change was among the issues discussed by Macron and Xi Jinping during the French president's three-day trip to China in early 2018. The two leaders also expressed their mutual support of multilateralism, while overseeing the signing of billions of dollars in trade agreements between the countries.

Around that time, Macron came under fire for the mistreatment of migrants at the port city of Calais, following reports of searches at emergency shelters and police confiscating blankets during freezing spells. The president delivered a speech at Calais on January 16, in which he sought to reassure those who questioned his compassion and warned police about their conduct. ""These are human beings to whom we have a duty of humanity,"" he said. ""You need to be exemplary, and you need to respect the dignity of each individual.""

On April 23, 2018, Macron became the first foreign leader to make a formal state visit to President Trump in Washington, D.C. Following their lengthy handshake from a previous encounter, the two men displayed a physical affection that delighted the media and spoke glowingly of one another, though their words hinted at the divide that remained on certain issues.

Trump said the U.S. and France were ""beginning to understand each other"" on the need to contain Iran, though he continued to criticize the nuclear deal as ""insane"" and ""ridiculous."" His French counterpart also expressed misgivings about aspects of the deal, though he said he hoped a new agreement could be forged on top of the current one.

""It’s not a mystery we did not have the same starting positions or stances, and neither you nor I have a habit of changing our stances or going with the wind,"" Macron told Trump during a press conference.

The two leaders also seemed to be on the same page about the need for continued military presence in Syria, though Macron indicated that they were still searching for common ground on the topic of environmentalism. ""It is together that we will be able to act effectively for our planet,"" he said. ""I'm not just referring to climate, but also to the oceans, to biodiversity, and to all forms of pollutions. On this issue, we do not always agree as to the solutions, but in the end, such is the case in any family and in any friendship.""

In a speech to the joint houses of Congress on April 26, Macron celebrated the ""unbreakable bonds"" of the U.S. and France, and urged his hosts to remain committed to the Iran nuclear deal. He made a plea for stronger environmental efforts through a twist on the Trump mantra, saying it was time to make the Earth great again. But Macron also delivered what some interpreted as a rebuke of Trump's America-first agenda, arguing that isolationism, withdrawal and nationalism ""will not stop the evolution of the world. It will not douse but inflame the fears of our citizens.""

Macron faced one of the stiffest challenges to his presidency to date when French citizens embarked on their ""Yellow Vests"" protests — named for their identifiable clothing — in late 2018. The movement stemmed from anger over rising fuel taxes.

Following weeks of protests, Macron in January 2019 wrote a 2,330-word letter to the public and proposed a ""Great National Debate"" to discuss economic ideas via a series of town halls. Regardless, the protests continued through the year.

In late April 2019, Macron held the first news conference of his presidency. Promising a ""more humanist"" approach, he said he would lower taxes, increase pensions and even close his alma mater, ENA, due to its perception as an elitist institution that funneled individuals from well-to-do backgrounds into the government hierarchy.

On April 15, 2019, the centuries-old Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris erupted in flames, resulting in the destruction of its roof and spire before the fire was quelled 12 hours later.

Macron seized the moment to bring his countrymen together in a televised address, calling for the iconic structure to be rebuilt in five years. ""It is up to us to change this disaster into an opportunity to come together, having deeply reflected on what we have been and what we have to be and become better than we are,"" he said. ""It is up to us to find the thread of our national project.""

After hosting the G7 Summit in Biarritz that summer, Macron took center stage again in late 2019 at the second annual Paris Peace Forum. In a speech to the 30-plus heads of state and government in attendance, the president pleaded for ""new ways of cooperation, new alliances"" to stem the rising tide of nationalism and address global issues ranging from terrorism and cyber security to immigration and climate change.

In the early months of 2020, Macron was among the world leaders grappling with how best to contain the coronavirus pandemic. On March 12, the president announced that schools, restaurants and parks would close. However, following a seemingly casual response by the public, Macron adopted a stricter tone while addressing the nation on March 16, ordering people to remain at home for the next 15 days under the threat of punishment.

He also pledged his support for the economy by saying he would suspend rent and utility bills for struggling small businesses, adding: ""No business will be allowed to fail.""

Macron has drawn attention for his romantic life: While attending high school in Amiens, he fell in love with his drama teacher, Brigitte Trogneux, 24 years his senior and then a married mother of three. Their affair was put on hold when he left for Paris, but they eventually resumed their romance and married in 2007.

429,"A policeman who brought a teenage girl protesting climate change to tears as he threatened to arrest her has been branded 'a coward'.

Schoolgirl Izzy Raj-Seppings, who was with her dad, was filmed being spoken to by a policeman outside the Australian Prime Minister's home who said she was 'blocking the road'.

Australia is currently being devastated by several bushfires, some raging out of control.

A record heatwave has claimed the lives of eight people including two volunteer firefighters whose vehicle was hit by a tree.

The record average maximum temperature of 40.9C degrees set on Tuesday was broken within 24 hours, with a national average of 41.9 recorded the next day.

Izzy, 13, was holding a sign which read ""Look at what you've left us, watch us fight it, watch us win.""

The demonstration outside Kirribilli House occurred as anger grows over the government’s handling of climate change amidst a bush fire crisis and nationwide heat wave.

The teenager was confronted by a policeman who said she would be arrested if she didn't move.

Video footage of the confrontation captured by a journalism student has been widely shared online.

At the demonstration, a police officer read the girl her rights: “I warn you that should you fail to comply with my direction, you may be arrested. Force may be used,” he said. “Do you understand, Izzy?”

The girl moved away from the house with her father, but later called the police ""cowards"".

Her emotional display was captured by journalism student River McCrossen who posted it on Twitter .

""We weren’t doing anything wrong - they’re being cowards,” she said.

397,"For more than 60 years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has known that the changes occurring to planetary weather patterns are completely natural and normal. But the space agency, for whatever reason, has chosen to let the man-made global warming hoax persist and spread, to the detriment of human freedom.

It was the year 1958, to be precise, when NASA first observed that changes in the solar orbit of the earth, along with alterations to the earth’s axial tilt, are both responsible for what climate scientists today have dubbed as “warming” (or “cooling,” depending on their agenda). In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet by driving SUVs or eating beef, in other words.

But NASA has thus far failed to set the record straight, and has instead chosen to sit silently back and watch as liberals freak out about the world supposedly ending in 12 years because of too much livestock, or too many plastic straws.

In the year 2000, NASA did publish information on its Earth Observatory website about the Milankovitch Climate Theory, revealing that the planet is, in fact, changing due to extraneous factors that have absolutely nothing to do with human activity. But, again, this information has yet to go mainstream, some 19 years later, which is why deranged, climate-obsessed leftists have now begun to claim that we really only have 18 months left before the planet dies from an excess of carbon dioxide (CO2).

The truth, however, is much more along the lines of what Serbian astrophysicist Milutin Milankovitch, after whom the Milankovitch Climate Theory is named, proposed about how the seasonal and latitudinal variations of solar radiation that hit the earth in different ways, and at different times, have the greatest impact on earth’s changing climate patterns.

The below two images (by Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC) help to illustrate this, with the first showing earth at a nearly zero orbit, and the second showing earth at a 0.07 orbit. This orbital change is depicted by the eccentric, oval shape in the second image, which has been intentionally exaggerated for the purpose of showing the massive change in distance that occurs between the earth and the sun, depending on whether it is at perihelion or aphelion.

“Even the maximum eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit – 0.07 – it would be impossible to show at the resolution of a web page,” notes the Hal Turner Radio Show. “Even so, at the current eccentricity of .017, the Earth is 5 million kilometers closer to Sun at perihelion than at aphelion.”

The biggest factor affecting earth’s climate is the SUN

As for earth’s obliquity, or its change in axial tilt, the below two images (Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC) show the degree to which the earth can shift on both its axis and its rotational orientation. At the higher tilts, earth’s seasons become much more extreme, while at lower tilts they become much more mild. A similar situation exists for earth’s rotational axis, which depending on which hemisphere is pointed at the sun during perihelion, can greatly impact the seasonal extremes between the two hemispheres.

Based on these different variables, Milankovitch was able to come up with a comprehensive mathematical model that is able to compute surface temperatures on earth going way back in time, and the conclusion is simple: Earth’s climate has always been changing, and is in a constant state of flux due to no fault of our own as human beings.

When Milankovitch first put forward his model, it went ignored for nearly half a century. Then, in 1976, a study published in the journal Science confirmed that Milankovitch’s theory is, in fact, accurate, and that it does correspond to various periods of climate change that have occurred throughout history.

In 1982, six years after this study was published, the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences adopted Milankovitch’s theory as truth, declaring that:

“… orbital variations remain the most thoroughly examined mechanism of climatic change on time scales of tens of thousands of years and are by far the clearest case of a direct effect of changing insolation on the lower atmosphere of Earth.”

If we had to sum the whole thing up in one simple phrase, it would be this: The biggest factor influencing weather and climate patterns on earth is the sun, period. Depending on the earth’s position to the sun at any given time, climate conditions are going to vary dramatically, and even create drastic abnormalities that defy everything that humans thought they knew about how the earth worked.

But rather than embrace this truth, today’s climate “scientists,” joined by leftist politicians and a complicit mainstream media, insist that not using reusable grocery bags at the supermarket and not having an electric vehicle are destroying the planet so quickly that we absolutely must implement global climate taxes as the solution.

“The climate change debate is not about science. It is an effort to impose political and economic controls on the population by the elite,” wrote one commenter at the Hal Turner Radio Show.

“And it’s another way to divide the population against itself, with some who believe in man-made global warming and some who don’t, i.e. divide and conquer.”

173,"Climate change is the long-term shift in average weather patterns across the world. Since the mid-1800s, humans have contributed to the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. This causes global temperatures to rise, resulting in long-term changes to the climate.

How are humans changing the climate?

In the 11,000 years before the Industrial Revolution, the average temperature across the world was stable at around 14°C. The Industrial Revolution began in the mid-1800s when humans began to burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas for fuel.

Burning fossil fuels produces energy, but also releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous monoxide into the air. Over time, large quantities of these gases have built up in the atmosphere.

For example, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose by 40% during the 20th and 21st century and is now over 400ppm (parts per million). This level of carbon dioxide is higher than at any time in the past 800,000 years.

This plot shows the global temperature change from 1850 to 2018, compared to the 1961-1990 average temperature.

This graph shows the rising level of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere since 1960, measured by the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.

Once in the atmosphere, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide form a 'blanket' around the planet. This blanket traps the heat from the sun and causes the earth to heat up.

This effect was noticed as far back as the 1980s. In 1988, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up to provide governments with information to tackle climate change.

Evidence has shown that the high levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are the leading cause of increasing global temperatures.

Scientists have been able to rule out natural events as causes of climate change, such as volcanic activity, changes in solar activity, or natural sources of CO2. These may, however, have a small effect, on top of human contributions.

In their most recent report, the IPCC states that human activity is 'extremely likely' to be the main cause of climate change.

How fast is the temperature rising?

Since the Industrial Revolution, the average temperature of the planet has risen by around 1°C. This is a rapid change in terms of our global climate system. Previously, natural global changes are understood to have happened over much longer periods of time. It is also important to remember that the world is not warming evenly, so the temperature increase is higher than 1°C in some countries.

This graph shows the average global temperature for each month, from 1850 to 2017. The temperature increases as you move away from the centre of the circle.

This image shows that the five warmest years have all occurred since 2006. Cooler years are blue, while warmer years are red.

This graph shows us that global temperatures are increasing. As of 2018, the 20 warmest years on record globally have been in the past 22 years. The Met Office’s State of the UK Climate report for 2018 shows the ten hottest years in the UK since 1884 have all happened in the last 17 years.

What is the greenhouse effect?

When greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide build in the atmosphere, they act like a blanket around the earth. When sunlight (short-wave radiation) hits this blanket, it passes straight through and continues until it reaches the surface of the planet.

The earth then absorbs this sunlight and emits a different type of light, infrared radiation, back out to space. As it leaves the atmosphere, the infrared radiation also hits the greenhouse gas blanket. Most of it goes straight through, but some of it is absorbed and goes back down to earth. This traps the infrared radiation and causes the surface to heat – a process we call the 'greenhouse effect'.

It is crucial to understand that the greenhouse effect is critical to life on earth. Without a blanket of greenhouse gases trapping in heat, the temperature would be bitterly cold, and humans would be unable to survive. However, by adding extra greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, humans have created an enhanced greenhouse effect.

The greenhouse gas blanket is now thicker and is absorbing more infrared radiation than before. In other words, the greenhouse effect is stronger and, instead of keeping the earth at a stable temperature, it is causing the planet to heat up.

What are the sources of greenhouse gases?

One-quarter of human-made greenhouse gas emissions come from burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat production.

This chart shows the human-made greenhouse gas emissions, taken from the IPCC AR5 report. AFOLU stands for Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use.

Another quarter of human-made greenhouse gas emissions comes from Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU).

To feed our livestock and ourselves, people have chopped down large areas of the forest and used the land to grow crops. Forests are very good at removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and so cutting down trees allows carbon dioxide to build up in the atmosphere even more.

Land can also be used to rear livestock, such as cattle for meat and milk. These animals produce additional gases, like methane. They also eat crops that might otherwise have been needed by humans, meaning that even more land is required.

As well as fossil fuels, deforestation and land use, aeroplanes and the production of cement also contribute to emissions of carbon dioxide.

How much warming could we see?

Greenhouse gases can live in our atmosphere for tens or hundreds of years. The gases that are already in our atmosphere are effectively locked in and will contribute to increasing temperatures.

Even if we stop all emissions today, we cannot avoid some level of warming. The amount of warming we will see, beyond what we have already caused, depends on the changes we make.

In 2015, almost every country in the world signed a document promising to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. The aim was to limit the average global temperature to 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures. If possible, countries pledged to aim for a 1.5°C limit.

Since then, the IPCC has published a report explaining the different impacts between a 1.5 or 2°C temperature rise. It showed that there are many benefits for people all over the world in limiting temperatures to 1.5°C. Large and rapid reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions are needed to meet this goal, however.

This chart from the IPCC shows two possible futures for our climate. The blue line represents what could happen if we commit to cutting emissions, and the red line represents what could happen if we don't make any changes.

If we want to avoid significant increases in the average surface temperature, we must cut greenhouse gas emissions and switch to renewable energy sources. We must also use land more sustainably and may need to use techniques to remove carbon dioxide from the air.

If we continue to burn fossil fuels and cut down forests at the same rate, the planet could warm by more than 4°C by 2100. This warming could fundamentally change life on earth, with potentially drastic consequences.

What is the difference between 1.5 or 2°C of warming?

Human activity – from releasing greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere, to changing the use of land – is the main driver of climate change. This has a range of impacts on the climate system, ecosystems, and people.

This image illustrates some of the drivers of climate change and the impacts they could have on the climate system.

Changes to the climate system include:
• Rising ocean levels – Rising temperatures are causing glaciers and ice sheets to melt, adding more water to the oceans and causing the ocean level to rise. Oceans absorb 90% of the extra heat from global warming: warmer water expands, and so our oceans are taking up more space.
• Ocean acidification – Ocean acidification occurs when the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and becomes more acidic. It is often called the 'evil twin' of climate change.
• Extreme weather events – Climate change is causing many extreme weather events to become more intense and frequent, such as heatwaves, droughts, and floods.

This graph, from Munich RE's Topics Geo Natural Catastrophes report, shows events causing loss are becoming more frequent.

Climate change can also affect people and ecosystems. For example:
• Flooding of coastal regions – Coastal cities are at risk from flooding as sea levels continue to rise.
• Food insecurity – High temperatures, extreme weather events, flooding, and droughts can damage farmland. This makes it difficult for farmers to grow crops and means that their yield of crops each year is uncertain.
• Conflict and climate migrants – Climate change is a stress multiplier – it can take existing problems, such as lack of food or shelter, and make them worse. This can cause people to fight over resources (food, water, and shelter), or to migrate.
• Damage to marine ecosystems – Rising ocean temperatures, ocean acidification, and ocean anoxia (lack of oxygen) are damaging to marine life such as fish and coral reefs.

How can we stop climate change?

The most crucial step to limit climate change is to make big and rapid reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. There are many different ways this can be done and governments, businesses, organisations and individuals around the world can all contribute. In June 2019, the UK became the world’s first major economy to pass a law committing the country to a target of ‘net zero’ emissions by 2050.

You can read more about what they are doing to achieve this, as well as what businesses and individuals can do to help, on the Green GB website.

577,"et’s pretend the 195 nations that signed the 2016 Paris Climate Accord really do take all of the steps necessary to reach the agreement’s key goal: limiting the increase in global temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

In that world, any children born today would grow up to witness some happy milestones. If they lived in the United Kingdom, they’d see their country phase out the use of coal by the time they turned six. If they lived in France, they would see gasoline-powered cars eliminated by their 21st birthday. And, as all of the 195 countries similarly reached their individual targets, all of the children born today would be 31 when the world reached net-zero greenhouse emissions.

But in the real world, the U.S. has already pulled out of the Paris agreement, other nations are observing it only spottily, global temperatures are continuing to rise—and the health of children is being clobbered in the process. In a sweeping study just published in , investigators from 35 institutions—including the World Health Organization, Imperial College London, The University of York, Yale University and Iran University of Medical Sciences—analyzed the planet’s climatological health on 41 indices, such as the rising incidence of floods, wildfires and mosquito-borne diseases; adaptation and mitigation steps being taken to address the problems; and economic resources being devoted to that work. They found that while progress is being made, too many trend lines continue to point downward. We will all pay a price for that, but today’s children will pay the highest.

“With every degree of warming, we are committing a child born today to a future where their health and well-being will be increasingly threatened,” says Dr. Renee Salas of the Harvard University Global Health Institute, lead author of the policy brief that accompanied the study. “Climate change, and the air pollution from fossil fuels that are driving it, threaten a child’s health starting in their mother’s womb and only accumulate from there.”

One of the most damaging examples of that cumulative phenomenon is the microscopic particulate matter produced by burning fossil fuels. The study found that more than 90% of the world’s 2.2 billion children are exposed to particles at concentrations above the safe limit defined by the World Health Organization. Drawing their first breath in a world like that leaves them at a higher lifetime risk of developing asthma, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And while the air is, on average, cleaner in wealthy countries like the U.S. than it was 50 years ago, the world as a whole is becoming more urbanized, with 70% of the global population expected to be living in cities by 2050—precisely where the air is dirtiest.

Rising temperatures, the leading indicator of climate change, do their own brand of pediatric damage. Children’s bodies are less adept than adults at regulating temperature, and babies rely on caretakers to remove them from the heat and give them water when temperatures rise. This, the study explains, leaves them at significantly greater danger of heat-related electrolyte imbalance, high fever, and kidney and respiratory disease.

In this case, geography is a force multiplier. While the average global temperature has risen 0.2°C compared to a 1983-2005 baseline, the average heat in big cities and other population centers, where most people live—what researchers call the population-weighted temperature—has risen 0.8°C. And in the hottest places, the one great hedge against heat—air conditioning—is often not available.

In the U.S. and Japan, for example, 90% of homes are air conditioned. In India, it’s 4%. Worse, while 19% and 13% of the population of the U.S. and Japan respectively are in the 0-to-14 age group, fully 35% of India’s 1.3 billion population is 14 or younger. That means nearly 450 million overheated children in a country where record-high temperatures caused tens of thousands of people to flee their homes last summer and led to nearly 200 deaths in the first half of June alone—exactly the kind of first-line heat problems the Paris Accords were designed to address.

Childhood nutrition suffers too. Rising temperatures are reducing the duration of the growing season for three key staples—maize, rice and spring wheat—slashing harvests and increasing the risk of famine in vulnerable developing countries. At the same time, rising sea temperatures are leading to a decline in fish stocks, a source of 20% of the protein in the diet of 3.2 billion people. “Globally, children are overwhelmingly the victims of undernutrition,” says Salas, “and suffer a range of health harms, such as smaller growth in the womb, stunted development, and lack of critical micronutrients.”

Finally, there are the diseases that thrive in a warming world. The most troubling explored in the study are malaria and dengue fever—which, again, take particular aim at children. The investigators found that both diseases are on the rise, more or less in lockstep with climate. The incidence of dengue fever in particular is already as much as 9.8% above pre-2012 baselines.

Climate change is a perversely egalitarian scourge, sparing no one, affecting everyone. But the special toll it takes on children makes it perversely cruel too. In a world that ostensibly prizes justice, it is unjust in the extreme for the people who are the least responsible for causing a problem to suffer from it the most. The Paris Accord—honored instead of ignored—offers a way out.",mainstream
116,"From building floating cities and towering sea walls to erecting snow cannons in Antarctica to help replenish melting polar ice, scientists and urban planners have proposed all sorts of schemes to defend against rising seas — one of the most worrisome consequences of climate change.

Now, designers in Indonesia have offered up what may be the most audacious plan yet: they propose building ice-making submarines that would ply polar waters and pop out icebergs to replace melting floes.

“Sea level rise due to melting ice should not only be responded [to] with defensive solutions,” the designers of the submersible iceberg factory said in an animated video describing the vessel, which took second place in a recent design competition held by the Association of Siamese Architects.

The video shows the proposed submarine dipping slowly beneath the ocean surface to allow seawater to fill its large hexagonal well. When the vessel surfaces, an onboard desalination system removes the salt from the water and a “giant freezing machine” and chilly ambient temperatures freeze the fresh water to create the six-sided bergs. These float away when the vessel resubmerges and starts the process all over again.

A fleet of the ice-making subs, operating continuously, could create enough of the 25-meter-wide “ice babies” to make a larger ice sheet, according to the designers. Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha, an architect in Jakarta and the leader of the project, said he sees the design as a complement to ongoing efforts to curb emissions.

“To stop global warming, of course we still have to reduce carbon emissions throughout the world,” he said in a message, adding that he advocated a two-pronged approach to curbing climate change: reduce carbon emissions on one hand and rebuild lost ice on the other.

Experts praised the designers' vision but cast doubt on the project's feasibility.

“It’s like trying to save the sand castle you built at the beach using a dixie cup as the tide comes in,” Michael Mann, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Penn State, said of the iceberg-making proposal.

Mark Serreze, director of the University of Colorado’s National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, offered a similar assessment. He called the project “very interesting” but said it raised more questions than it answered.

“What are you going to do, put out a flotilla of 10,000 submarines?” he said. “Who’s going to build them and how much energy does it take, and how are the submarines powered?” And unless they’re powered by wind or another clean energy source, he added, the submarines would need to burn fossil fuels, releasing even more planet-warming greenhouse gases into the air.

If the icebergs were big enough, they might help curb sea level rise indirectly by reflecting more of the solar radiation that raises global temperatures. But Serreze said creating the bergs wouldn’t lower sea levels directly if they remained in the water; they'd have to wind up on land to reduce the volume of the oceans.

More important, Serreze said, rebuilding sea ice would do nothing to address the greenhouse gas emissions that are the root cause of climate change. “It’s simply a Band-Aid,” he said of the ice-making vessel idea.

Serreze voiced similar concerns about other recent proposals for geoengineering the environment to mitigate the effects of climate change, including everything from spraying sunlight-blocking aerosols into the atmosphere to deploying millions of wind-powered pumps to spread seawater over the planet's northernmost reaches.

Such plans are often not feasible, he said, and they could have unintended consequences that compound our environmental problems. For example, he said, the spraying of aerosols in one region could lead to droughts in another. Nevertheless, he called geoengineering an important tool in the ongoing fight against climate change — but one that should be considered a last resort.

“There has been a lot of work on geoengineering, and it should continue,” he said. “We never want to go in that direction. But if it’s a last gasp, then you try it.”

854,"THE world may have already crossed nine key ""tipping points"" that will lead to catastrophic climate change, scientists warn.

Passing the alarming milestones means ""we are in a state of planetary emergency"" that could see humanity wiped from the planet.

So much damage has been done in the nine outlined areas that the effects of global warming could accelerate and create a deadly domino effect, researchers wrote in the journal Nature.

Points of no return picked out by the team include the loss of the Amazon rainforest and the great ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland – damage from which our planet may never recover.

""A decade ago we identified a suite of potential tipping points in the Earth system,"" said lead author Professor Tim Lenton, from the University of Exeter.

""Now we see evidence that over half of them have been activated.""

The team, made up of top researchers from the UK, Germany, Denmark and Australia, said urgent action was needed to reduce emissions before further milestones are passed.

""The growing threat of rapid, irreversible changes means it is no longer responsible to wait and see,"" Professor Lenton said.

""The situation is urgent and we need an emergency response.""

A tipping point is reached when certain impacts of global warming become unstoppable, such as heavy ice loss in Antarctica.

Among the nine tipping points outlined by scientists were thawing of permafrost in Russia, large-scale die-offs of coral and a slowdown of ocean currents in the Atlantic.

Droughts in the Amazon rainforest and fires in the far north of Canada and Russia were also said to be key crossroads identified a decade ago that are now ""active"".

Due to the way our planet's ecosystem is connected, as each tipping point is reached, others not currently active are pushed closer to the brink.

""It is not only human pressures on Earth that continue rising to unprecedented levels,"" said study coauthor Professor Johan Rockström, of the Potsdam Institute in Germany.

""As science advances, we must admit that we have underestimated the risks of unleashing irreversible changes, where the planet self-amplifies global warming.""

This cascade of changes sparked by global warming could threaten the existence of human civilisations, according to the researchers.

The collapse of major ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica alone would drive sea levels up by 10 metres, turfing millions in coastal areas from their homes.

Changes to Atlantic currents have already triggered more frequent and destructive hurricanes across the western world.

In the past, it was thought that the planet would need to heat up by 5C for Earth's tipping points to be reached.

However, evidence shows we have already started to hit them between 1C and 2C.

Earth has heated by around 1C since pre-industrial temperatures, a figure that is certain to rise in the coming decades.

""Scientifically, this provides strong evidence for declaring a state of planetary emergency,"" Professor Rockström added.

""We must unleash world action that accelerates the path towards a world that can continue evolving on a stable planet.""

Nearly 200 countries signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, pledging to keep global warming below 2C.

However, current national emissions pledges – even if they are met – would lead to 3C of warming.

Experts argued that further international action was needed, as it could slow the impacts of climate change, giving more time for people to adapt.

Professor Lenton added: ""We might already have crossed the threshold for a cascade of inter-related tipping points.

""However, the rate at which they progress, and therefore the risk they pose, can be reduced by cutting our emissions.""

His team concluded in their paper: ""If damaging tipping cascades can occur and a global tipping cannot be ruled out, then this is an existential threat to civilisation.""

""A saving grace is that the rate at which damage accumulates from tipping could still be under our control to some extent.

""The stability and resilience of our planet is in peril. International action – not just words – must reflect this.""

In other news, shocking photos this week revealed how Swiss glaciers have nearly disappeared since the 1800s.

Seaside towns were recently urged by experts to ""move inland"" as climate change meant a retreat was needed.

903,"(CNN) The climate crisis threatens the very future of major sports and sporting events around the world, while the global sports industry is failing to address its own emissions, a new report has found.

In the future, almost all sports, including tennis, rugby, athletics, cricket, football and winter sports will suffer the impact of a warming world, facing heatwaves, floods, fires and rising sea levels, the study released Saturday by the Rapid Transition Alliance found.

Almost a quarter of English league football grounds can expect flooding of their stadiums each year by 2050, while one in three British Open golf courses will be threatened by rising sea levels, the study said.

Meanwhile the Winter Olympics , along with other winter sports, will become increasingly difficult to host because of rising temperatures, the report warned.

The area around the International Stadium Yokohama is deserted as Typhoon Hagibis approaches on October 12, 2019 in Yokohama, Japan.

Heatwaves and heat stroke will threaten the health of both players and fans, extreme weather events and sea level rise caused by climate change will flood stadiums and playing fields, and sea level rise will threaten golf courses, the report warned.

The study, released Saturday, found that sports leaders were largely failing to address the crisis, or their part in creating it.

The report authors warned that global sport's carbon emissions are equivalent to that of a country the size of Angola by lower estimates, and Spain at upper estimates.

But in spite of this, there has been a ""woefully inadequate"" response from the sporting industry the report authors said, noting that only a ""tiny fraction"" of the world's leagues, federations, tournaments, clubs and sporting bodies had made carbon targets, outlined their environmental commitments or signed up to the UN Sport for Climate Action Framework.

Meanwhile, petrochemical companies, airlines and vehicle manufactures still maintained a presence as key advertisers and sponsors of sport, the study said.

""Sport provides some of society's most influential role models. If sport can change how it operates to act at the speed and scale necessary to halt the climate emergency, others will follow,"" Andrew Simms, coordinator of the Rapid Transition Alliance, which published the report, said in a statement.

""A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles. At the moment sport is part of the problem, but it can become part of the solution,"" he said.

Report author David Goldblatt said that while widespread changes need to be made on a global scale to address the climate crisis, the sporting industry could spark a sea change if it committed to addressing climate change.

""Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single mega city, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total. Yet few human practices offer such an extraordinarily large, global, and socially diverse constituency as those playing and following sport.

""Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,"" he said.",mainstream

How Greta Thunberg — Now the Youngest TIME Person of the Year Ever — 'Destroys' Asperger's Stigma

The Swedish 16 year old — who was named TIME’s Person of the Year on Wednesday, making her the youngest person to ever be given the honor — hasn’t shied away from flipping the script on her Asperger’s, at one point referring to it not as an obstacle but as her “superpower.”

The pride with which she embraces her diagnosis has not been lost on others with Asperger’s, who now view Thunberg as a role model. Case in point: the trending Twitter hashtag “Autistics for Greta.”

“She is my SHERO!” user @hmcooperauthor wrote in September. “Such a fearless, articulate young woman. We might be considered ‘odd, weird, quirky….’ Or whatever adjectives that you prefer to insert but I’m convinced folks on the Autism Spectrum have superpowers that you all just don’t…”

User @ThruThePrismArt agreed, writing, “I’m on the spectrum. Anyone who underestimates Greta has NO IDEA how powerful the autistic brain is when set to a specific goal. The strength of being #ActuallyAutistic is LIMITLESS.”

“This is it!! This is what ASD is. Passion and unending dedication to a cause,” user @AmberOckerbloom added. “@GretaThunberg is a superhero to my daughter and all those on the spectrum. ASD is why she is who she is. How can that ever be something bad?!”

Regardless of why they’re paying attention to her, Thunberg told PEOPLE she knows she has many eyes watching her every move — and hopes to make the best of it.

“Right now, I have a lot of people listening to what I am saying, so I am using that platform to try to achieve a change,” she said.

The disorder is characterized by having difficulty with social interactions, restricted interests, a desire for sameness, and distinctive strengths, like “remarkable” focus and persistence, an aptitude for recognizing patterns, and attention to detail, according to Autism Speaks.

Those strengths have served Thunberg well, as she explained on CBS This Morning that her Asperger’s actually helps her in seeing the world through a different lens.

“In some circumstances it can definitely be an advantage to have some kind of neurotypical diagnosis, to be neurodiverse, because that makes you different, that makes you think differently,” she said. “And especially in such a big crisis like this, when we need to think outside the box. We need to think outside our current system, we need people who think outside the box and who aren’t like everyone else.”

“I’m not public about my diagnosis to ‘hide’ behind it, but because I know many ignorant people still see it as an ‘illness,’ or something negative,” she wrote.

“I think she’s a role model to everyone,” Remi told NBC News. “But I think for somebody who has Asperger’s or is on the autism spectrum, her ability to be honest and disclose it in such an empowering way is what’s inspirational. Greta is disclosing it in a way that she’s proud of.”

“It means a lot that she’s willingly embraced Asperger’s syndrome and talks about it openly. It creates a lot of awareness and destroys some stigmas,” he said. “I think it would have had a tremendous impact on what I viewed as possible not only for myself, but for cultivating relationships around me.”

“I think it’s very hopeful, all the young people who are a part of the climate change movement,” she previously told PEOPLE. “That keeps me going, to see that it actually has made a difference. Because there is no second option.”",mainstream
307,"Protecting the Environment and Addressing Climate Change at Home: November 2008 to January 2017

From the day he first took office in January 2009 to the day he left office in January 2017, President Barack Obama believed that no challenge posed a greater threat to our children, our planet, and future generations than climate change. Indeed, as he saw it, acting on climate change was a moral obligation of the present, not a distant problem of the future. And that’s because, long before President Obama assumed office, the planet was already changing in ways that—if left unchecked—would have a profound impact on all of humankind. The scientific evidence accumulated and reviewed over the past several decades showed unequivocally that the planet was warming, primarily due to human activities over the past 50 years. As a result, summers were becoming longer and hotter. Winters were becoming shorter and warmer. Ice on land and in lakes and seas was melting. Global sea levels were rising. And from storms, hurricanes, and heavy downpours to droughts, fires, and floods, extreme weather was becoming more frequent and intense. Simply put, climate change was dramatically altering the world—and altering it in ways detrimental to life on Earth.

This timeline tells the story of how the President and his team took action to mitigate the impacts of climate change and protect our environment at home. It documents the decisions made, as well as the challenges faced, by the Administration in its efforts to protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land that supports and sustains us. Above all, the timeline shows that—from reducing carbon pollution and expanding the clean energy economy to increasing the resilience of communities to the impacts of climate change to restoring ecosystems and preserving iconic landscapes—the President worked diligently to bring together Federal agencies, and all stakeholders, to tackle the greatest environmental challenges and economic opportunities of our time.
• November 4, 2008 – President-elect Obama pledged “to build new partnerships to defeat the threat of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation, poverty and genocide, climate change and disease.”
• November 18, 2008 – President-elect Obama pledged that “My presidency will mark a new chapter in America’s leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process.”
• January 26, 2009 – President Obama signed a memorandum directing the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to begin working to update vehicle fuel economy standards.
• April 1, 2010 –The U.S. EPA and the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) finalized a joint rule to establish a national program consisting of new standards for model year 2012 through 2016 light-duty vehicles that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy.
• August 28, 2012 – EPA and DOT issued greenhouse gas and fuel economy standards covering passenger cars and trucks for model years 2017–2025 that will nearly double the fuel efficiency of those vehicles compared to new vehicles currently on our roads, saving households hundreds of millions of dollars at the pump and making the U.S. less reliant on fossil fuels.
• Since 2009, DOE’s Building Technologies Office (BTO) has issued 58 new or updated appliance and equipment standards, which are projected to save consumers over $550 billion off their utility bills through 2030, equivalent to saving the average family nearly $200 per year, and cut carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 3 billion metric tons.
• February 17, 2009 – President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which not only helped bring about a macroeconomic recovery but also invested $90 billion in clean energy and energy efficiency, the largest single investment in clean energy in history.
• In a retrospective analysis of the ARRA, published in February 2015, the White House Council of Economic Advisers found that these investments transformed America’s clean energy economy by supporting job creation, driving innovation, and scaling up renewable energy. In particular, through loan guarantees to support more than $40 billion of investment as well as tax credits, the Recovery Act spurred a major expansion of renewable energy generation through more than 100,000 projects across the country, including one of the world’s largest wind farms and the first large scale solar projects. By the end of President Obama’s first term, DOE and HUD completed efficiency upgrades in nearly two million homes, saving many families more than $400 on their heating and cooling bills in the first year alone.
• March 30, 2009 – President Obama signed the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, designating more than 2 million acres of Federal wilderness, creating thousands of miles of trails, and protecting more than 1,000 miles of rivers. It marked the most extensive expansion of land and water conservation in more than a generation
• April 27, 2009 – President Obama announced the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E), a high-risk, high-reward research program modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to support transformative energy technology projects.
• By February 2015, ARPA-E had invested approximately $1.3 billion across more than 475 projects, which had generated over $1.25 billion in follow-on funding. (Click here for more information.)
• Annual patent filing for clean energy and pollution control technologies has more than doubled since 2008.
• October 5, 2009 – To lead by example, President Obama signed an Executive Order that set sustainability goals for Federal agencies that focused on improving their environmental, energy, and economic performance. (Click here for more information.)
• Since the President took office, the Federal government has:
• Reduced greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 18 percent, avoiding the emission of over 41 million metric tons of carbon pollution, equivalent to taking 8.7 million cars off the road for one year;
• Cut energy use intensity at targeted federal facilities by more than 15 percent. The energy savings in 2015 alone resulted in a cost savings of $680 million to taxpayers;
• Reduced water consumption by more than 20 percent;

973,"The impacts of climate change hit close to home on Colombia's small, independent coffee farms. For the farm families who grow coffee high up on the mist-shrouded slopes of the Andes in the Caldas province, increasingly erratic and extreme weather conditions, such as excess rainfall and more frequent droughts, are threatening a way of life generations in the making. Drought can damage bean development inside ripening fruit, resulting in beans that are twisted, undersized, or otherwise not fully formed. Meanwhile, too much rain during the delicate flowering stage can harm the flowers and keep fruit from developing at all—no flowers means no coffee cherries.

""When there are adverse climatic events it affects the quality and quantity of the coffee,"" says Caldas coffee farmer Edilma Garzón Gutierrez. ""Sometimes we have to look for another kind of income because the coffee will not suffice.""

To help Doña Eldima and other smallholder coffee farmers in Caldas protect their livelihood, Nespresso, in partnership with Blue Marble Microinsurance, launched a pilot weather-index insurance programme in 2018 that provides custom coverage for crop losses due to climatic shocks. Farmers have already started to receive a payback from this insurance in 2019.

""The crop insurance project is great,"" says Doña Eldima. ""When we pick less coffee, or the coffee is bad quality because of the weather, we have help to confront difficult times.""

Doña Eldima is among the nearly 2,000 farmer-members of the Aguadas and Norte de Caldas cooperatives in Caldas enrolled in the pilot harvest insurance plan, run by Colombian insurance company Seguros Bolivar and supported through the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality™ Programme. Launched in 2003, the AAA programme works to create long-term, sustainable coffee quality by building direct relationships with local growers.",mainstream
152,"Carbon dioxide emissions are making the Earth greener and more fertile, a United Nations (UN) climate scientist has said.

In a paper for the Global Warming Policy Foundation, Dr Indur Goklany, who has previously represented the United States on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), says that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere “is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally”.

The benefits are real, whereas the costs of warming are uncertain,” he adds.

“Carbon dioxide fertilises plants, and emissions from fossil fuels have already had a hugely beneficial effect on crops, increasing yields by at least 10-15 per cent,” Dr Golkany argues.

“This has not only been good for humankind but for the natural world too, because an acre of land that is not used for crops is an acre of land that is left for nature.”

This image shows the change in leaf area across the globe from 1982-2015.

Increasing crops yields has helped reduce hunger and improved human well being, as well as generating around $140 billion a year.

As well as crops, the “wild places of the Earth” have seen an improvement, becoming greener in recent decades. Dr Golkany attributes this to carbon dioxide, saying it can also increase their water-use efficiency, thus making them more resistant to drought.

“Unlike the claims of future global warming disasters,” Dr Golkany says, “These benefits are firmly established and are being felt now.

“Yet despite this the media overlook the good news and the public remain in the dark. My report should begin to restore a little balance.”

Professor Myles Allen of the University of Oxford admitted there were some benefits from increased levels of carbon dioxide, but nonetheless said Dr Golkany’s assertions had “Stalinist overtones”.

“… I worry about the Stalinist overtones of adding up the losses and benefits and deciding humanity as a whole will benefit from global warming. Drowning Bangladeshis might not be reassured by higher crop yields in Ukraine.”

However, in a foreword to the report, Professor Freeman Dyson, a world-renowned physicist, said Dr Golkany’s conclusions show how “a whole generation of scientific experts is blind to obvious facts”, adding that “the thinking of politicians and scientists about controversial issues today is still tribal”.

I would also like to add the following from NASA’s website:

From a quarter to half of Earth’s vegetated lands has shown significant greening over the last 35 years largely due to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change on April 25, [2016].

An international team of 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries led the effort, which involved using satellite data from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instruments to help determine the leaf area index, or amount of leaf cover, over the planet’s vegetated regions.

The greening represents an increase in leaves on plants and trees equivalent in area to two times the continental United States.

Green leaves use energy from sunlight through photosynthesis to chemically combine carbon dioxide drawn in from the air with water and nutrients tapped from the ground to produce sugars, which are the main source of food, fiber and fuel for life on Earth.

Studies have shown that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide increase photosynthesis, spurring plant growth.

However, carbon dioxide fertilization isn’t the only cause of increased plant growth—nitrogen, land cover change and climate change by way of global temperature, precipitation and sunlight changes all contribute to the greening effect.

To determine the extent of carbon dioxide’s contribution, researchers ran the data for carbon dioxide and each of the other variables in isolation through several computer models that mimic the plant growth observed in the satellite data.

Results showed that carbon dioxide fertilization explains 70 percent of the greening effect, said co-author Ranga Myneni, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University.

“The second most important driver is nitrogen, at 9 percent. So we see what an outsized role CO2 plays in this process.”",conspiracy

During its 5,000 years in existence as a nation, China has created a cultural and technological legacy of global significance. Within the past century alone, China valiantly resisted and overcame the assaults of both Japan and the United States, taking a course free from the shackles of self-serving imperialism.

Yet unfortunately, in recent times, China has been inflicting increasing harm upon the planetary environment – playing a major role in the rapidly worsening climate situation. Since 2006, China has been the number one releaser of greenhouse gases that have irrevocably skewed the planet’s weather systems, inflicting widespread harm, with far worse forecasts lying ahead.

Indeed, no other country now comes close in its contribution to planet-altering climate change. Not even America, the second largest carbon producer in the world, and on an increasingly destructive environmental path under the Donald Trump administration. China releases over twice as much greenhouse gases as the US, the most powerful country in history. Indeed, China discharges more fossil fuel emissions than the US, India and Russia combined, the latter two being the third and fourth biggest carbon emitters.

In the past few decades, China has endured massive, self-inflicted environmental deterioration in government attempts to raise the population’s living standards. Since the “land reform” campaigns of the late 1970s, about 700 million rural Chinese have indeed been lifted from grinding poverty. This has been achieved, however, through sustained attacks upon the country’s vast ecosystems – accelerating industrialization – a critical turning point in the planet’s lifespan. China has witnessed great declines in its grasslands, wetlands, lakes, coral reefs, mangrove forests, etc., while over a quarter of the entire Chinese landmass has succumbed to desertification.

Improvements in the Chinese quality of life could have instead been formulated on more sustainable, eco-friendly means benefiting humans while greatly reducing damage to the environment. Even as reports of worsening climate change were mounting – tracing back at least two decades – little has been done to address the root causes of China’s climate crisis, its fossil fuel dependence which continues apace. The country has in recent times been paying a severe price for its environmental degradation.

China has the worst air quality of any country, containing the majority of the world’s most polluted cities. It is estimated that up to two million Chinese die each year as a result of consistent exposure to poisonous aerial fumes. Furthermore, China has significant water contamination problems with about 40% of the nation’s rivers suffering extensive pollution, due to agricultural and industrial waste.

China is the world’s biggest consumer of coal, last year burning over four times as much coal as second-place India, and more than five-fold that of the US. China is also clear in the distance as the world’s greatest coal producer. In addition, the Chinese are the biggest oil importers on earth and are the second largest consumers of oil (behind the US), while the country is the fourth greatest guzzler of gas. As we enter the end of the second decade of the 21st century, it is astonishing that China continues relying so heavily upon fossil fuels – tendencies which should have been seriously addressed and reduced many years before.

Trends so far in 2018 reveal China’s rising consumption of a variety of fossil fuels. Three months ago, the non-governmental organization Greenpeace outlined that,

Some admirable attempts in recent years by China, in leading the way with renewable energy investments and reforestation efforts, will be negated if the country does not tackle its fossil fuel dependence. This is above all crucial. A signatory of the Paris Climate Agreement, China’s full emissions for 2018 are forecast to rise by 5% on the previous year, the largest annual increase since 2011.

The Greenpeace report that, “For the decade up to 2013, China’s CO2 emissions were the dominant driver of global emissions growth, making it nearly impossible for global emissions to peak” and fall. With emissions again taking off at this critical juncture, Greenpeace pins the blame on the Chinese government for “running an aggressive stimulus program that has breathed life to smokestack industries, and set the clock back on the economic transformation and clean energy transition that are so crucial for the country’s future”.

By 2025 another colossus, neighboring India, will overtake China as the world’s most populous country. As mentioned, India is the planet’s third largest greenhouse gas emitter, and its fossil fuel imprint is steadily increasing, even after the nation recently signed up to the Paris Climate Agreement. Within the past two years alone, India’s greenhouse gases have increased by almost 10%. Indeed, since 1971 India’s carbon emissions have risen by over 1,000%.

Like China, India is unwilling to separate fossil fuel reliance from its economy, with the country being the second biggest coal burner in the world (behind China). Moreover, India is the planet’s third greatest oil consumer and third biggest importer of oil, being topped only by China and the US in both cases. With regard oil and coal, India’s trend for consumption of the lethal substances is rising. At this pivotal phase, it is again truly amazing to see that the major powers are actively accelerating the race to disaster.

India’s failures, along with that of the other major powers, are already impacting its people. Extreme weather events in the country are increasing. Earlier this month, after “once a century” monsoon rains, hundreds of people died in the southern Indian state of Kerala, with 1.3 million people displaced. Two-and-a-half times the normal level of rainfall fell, which matched the forecast of climate scientists predicting such a calamity. In reality, the “once a century” rains will likely be witnessed on numerous occasions, and in rising severity, during the years to come.

With India already among the hottest countries in the world, its general population is increasingly suffering from soaring heat and drought. A national record temperature of 123 degrees Fahrenheit (51 Celsius) was noted in May 2016 in the northern state of Rajasthan, a heat wave which killed over 1,600 people across India. This list of destructive side effects can be linked to India’s rising industrialization occurring in the second half of the 20th century, resulting in inevitable deterioration of its environment – loss of wetlands and lakes, deforestation, pollution of rivers and atmosphere, etc., which led to significant losses with regard the country’s globally important biodiversity.

The environmental decline is in many ways encapsulated by the travails of India’s majestic Bengal tiger, which numbered between 40,000 to 50,000 in the year 1900, but then fell to less than 2,000 tigers by 1972 (today, numbers are slightly more than 2,000 after extensive conservation efforts). An adult male tiger requires a territory covering 60 to 100 square kilometers, yet there have been no qualms confining these animals to zoos, when by all moral accounts such actions should long ago have been banned.

The issue of climate change itself has been in the public domain for six decades or more. In 1957 the American scientists, Roger Revelle and Hans Suess, co-authored a paper signalling the planet’s oceans would not absorb all the human-generated carbon emissions, as previously thought. The Revelle-Suess study instead suggested that the artificial carbon dioxide levels might create a “greenhouse effect” resulting in further global warming as the decades progressed.

These findings added weight to the opinions of Guy Stewart Callendar, an English inventor and steam engineer. As early as 1938 Callendar provided evidence that, over the previous half century, the world’s land temperatures had risen due to the ongoing human-driven emissions of carbon dioxide, dating to the Industrial Revolution. Callendar’s views at the time were met with skepticism and ridicule, but were later proved accurate.

The above assertions were further bolstered in 1961, when the American scientist Charles Keeling amassed evidence-based data proving that carbon emissions were considerably rising, due to human consumption of fossil fuels. The “Keeling Curve” had already been created in the late 1950s, a graph outlining the rising levels of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere, showing an upward curve ever since. In 1963, America’s National Science Foundation issued the first public warnings with regard the planet’s heating, and were delivered to president Lyndon B. Johnson that very year. As one can see, these critical warnings were well known by government leaders from an early stage.

Less than a decade later, in 1972, the eminent English meteorologist John Sawyer published his study titled, Man-made Carbon Dioxide and the ‘Greenhouse’ effect. In his work Sawyer predicted, accurately as time would prove, that:

Now, it will be impossible to limit the globe’s heating to 2 Celsius, with global greenhouse gas levels having shot up by over 60% since 1990. Sawyer’s work was published in the long-running British scientific journal, Nature, so his findings were surely well known.

The above scientific studies provided clear warnings of what was to come if government strategies were not altered, and shifted away from the destructive influence of multinational corporations. This evidence-based data should have been inserted into government policy from the 1960s and 1970s onwards, reducing a threat that today has evolved into a proverbial monster. Instead, such works by Revelle, Suess and Sawyer were cast into obscurity, overlooked and forgotten, as the world’s carbon emissions continued their rise.

1178,"Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.

Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016, and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration.

Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.

At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar.

In grade school, Musk was short, introverted and bookish. He was bullied until he was 15 and went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling.

Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a Covergirl campaign. When Musk was growing up, she worked five jobs at one point to support her family.

Musk spent his early childhood with his brother Kimbal and sister Tosca in South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10.

At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.

In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.

After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.

Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal Musk. An online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options.

In 1999, Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2 to found X.com, an online financial services/payments company. An X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation of PayPal as it is known today.

In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.

Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002 with the intention of building spacecraft for commercial space travel. By 2008, SpaceX was well established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own space shuttle missions.

On May 22, 2012, Musk and SpaceX made history when the company launched its Falcon 9 rocket into space with an unmanned capsule. The vehicle was sent to the International Space Station with 1,000 pounds of supplies for the astronauts stationed there, marking the first time a private company had sent a spacecraft to the International Space Station. Of the launch, Musk was quoted as saying, ""I feel very lucky. ... For us, it's like winning the Super Bowl.""

In December 2013, a Falcon 9 successfully carried a satellite to geosynchronous transfer orbit, a distance at which the satellite would lock into an orbital path that matched the Earth's rotation. In February 2015, SpaceX launched another Falcon 9 fitted with the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite, aiming to observe the extreme emissions from the sun that affect power grids and communications systems on Earth.

In March 2017, SpaceX saw the successful test flight and landing of a Falcon 9 rocket made from reusable parts, a development that opened the door for more affordable space travel.

A setback came in November 2017, when an explosion occurred during a test of the company's new Block 5 Merlin engine. SpaceX reported that no one was hurt, and that the issue would not hamper its planned rollout of a future generation of Falcon 9 rockets.

The company enjoyed another milestone moment in February 2018 with the successful test launch of the powerful Falcon Heavy rocket. Armed with additional Falcon 9 boosters, the Falcon Heavy was designed to carry immense payloads into orbit and potentially serve as a vessel for deep space missions. For the test launch, the Falcon Heavy was given a payload of Musk's cherry-red Tesla Roadster, equipped with cameras to ""provide some epic views"" for the vehicle's planned orbit around the sun.

In July 2018, Space X enjoyed the successful landing of a new Block 5 Falcon rocket, which touched down on a drone ship less than 9 minutes after liftoff.

In September 2017, Musk presented an updated design plan for his BFR (an acronym for either ""Big F---ing Rocket"" or ""Big Falcon Rocket""), a 31-engine behemoth topped by a spaceship capable of carrying at least 100 people. He revealed that SpaceX was aiming to launch the first cargo missions to Mars with the vehicle in 2022, as part of his overarching goal of colonizing the Red Planet.

In March 2018, the entrepreneur told an audience at the annual South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, that he hoped to have the BFR ready for short flights early the following year, while delivering a knowing nod at his previous problems with meeting deadlines.

The following month, it was announced that SpaceX would construct a facility at the Port of Los Angeles to build and house the BFR. The port property presented an ideal location for SpaceX, as its mammoth rocket will only be movable by barge or ship when completed.

In late March 2018, SpaceX received permission from the U.S. government to launch a fleet of satellites into low orbit for the purpose of providing Internet service. The satellite network, named Starlink, would ideally make broadband service more accessible in rural areas, while also boosting competition in heavily populated markets that are typically dominated by one or two providers.

SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites in May 2019, and followed with another payload of 60 satellites that November. While this represented significant progress for the Starlink venture, the appearance of these bright orbiters in the night sky, with the potential of thousands more to come, worried astronomers who felt that a proliferation of satellites would increase the difficulty of studying distant objects in space.

Musk is the co-founder, CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors, a company formed in 2003 that is dedicated to producing affordable, mass-market electric cars as well as battery products and solar roofs. Musk oversees all product development, engineering and design of the company's products.

Five years after its formation, in March 2008, Tesla unveiled the Roadster, a sports car capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, as well as traveling nearly 250 miles between charges of its lithium ion battery.

With a stake in the company taken by Daimler and a strategic partnership with Toyota, Tesla Motors launched its initial public offering in June 2010, raising $226 million.

In August 2008, Tesla announced plans for its Model S, the company's first electric sedan that was reportedly meant to take on the BMW 5 series. In 2012, the Model S finally entered production at a starting price of $58,570. Capable of covering 265 miles between charges, it was honored as the 2013 Car of the Year by Motor Trend magazine.

In April 2017, Tesla announced that it surpassed General Motors to become the most valuable U.S. car maker. The news was an obvious boon to Tesla, which was looking to ramp up production and release its Model 3 sedan later that year.

In September 2019, using what Musk described as a ""Plaid powertrain,"" a Model S set a speed record for four-door sedan at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey County, California.

The Model 3 was officially launched in March 2019 following extensive production delays. The car was initially priced at $35,000, a much more accessible price point than the $69,500 and up for its Model S and X electric sedans.

After initially aiming to produce 5,000 new Model 3 cars per week by December 2017, Musk pushed that goal back to March 2018, and then to June with the start of the new year. The announced delay didn't surprise industry experts, who were well aware of the company's production problems, though some questioned how long investors would remain patient with the process. It also didn't prevent Musk from garnering a radical new compensation package as CEO, in which he would be paid after reaching milestones of growing valuation based on $50 billion increments.

By April 2018, with Tesla expected to fall short of first-quarter production forecasts, news surfaced that Musk had pushed aside the head of engineering to personally oversee efforts in that division. In a Twitter exchange with a reporter, Musk said it was important to ""divide and conquer"" to meet production goals and was ""back to sleeping at factory.""

After signaling that the company would reorganize its management structure, Musk in June announced that Tesla was laying off 9 percent of its workforce, though its production department would remain intact. In an email to employees, Musk explained his decision to eliminate some ""duplication of roles"" to cut costs, admitting it was time to take serious steps toward turning a profit.

The restructuring appeared to pay dividends, as it was announced that Tesla had met its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of June 2018, while churning out another 2,000 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. ""We did it!"" Musk wrote in a celebratory email to the company. ""What an incredible job by an amazing team.""

The following February, Musk announced that the company was finally rolling out its standard Model 3. Musk also said that Tesla was shifting to all-online sales, and offering customers the chance to return their cars within seven days or 1,000 miles for a full refund.

In November 2017, Musk made another splash with the unveiling of the new Tesla Semi and Roadster at the company's design studio. The semi-truck, which was expected to enter into production in 2019 before being delayed, boasts 500 miles of range as well as a battery and motors built to last 1 million miles.

In March 2019, Musk unveiled Tesla’s long-awaited Model Y. The compact crossover, which began arriving for customers in March 2020, has a driving range of 300 miles and a 0 to 60 mph time of 3.5 seconds.

The Roadster, also set to be released in 2020, will become the fastest production car ever made, with a 0 to 60 time of 1.9 seconds.

In August 2016, in Musk’s continuing effort to promote and advance sustainable energy and products for a wider consumer base, a $2.6 billion dollar deal was solidified to combine his electric car and solar energy companies. His Tesla Motors Inc. announced an all-stock deal purchase of SolarCity Corp., a company Musk had helped his cousins start in 2006. He is a majority shareholder in each entity.

“Solar and storage are at their best when they're combined. As one company, Tesla (storage) and SolarCity (solar) can create fully integrated residential, commercial and grid-scale products that improve the way that energy is generated, stored and consumed,” read a statement on Tesla’s website about the deal.

In January 2017, Musk launched The Boring Company, a company devoted to boring and building tunnels in order to reduce street traffic. He began with a test dig on the SpaceX property in Los Angeles.

In late October of that year, Musk posted the first photo of his company's progress to his Instagram page. He said the 500-foot tunnel, which would generally run parallel to Interstate 405, would reach a length of two miles in approximately four months.

In May 2019 the company, now known as TBC, landed a $48.7 million contract from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to build an underground Loop system to shuttle people around the Las Vegas Convention Center.

On August 7, 2018, Musk dropped a bombshell via a tweet: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" The announcement opened the door for legal action against the company and its founder, as the SEC began inquiring about whether Musk had indeed secured the funding as claimed. Several investors filed lawsuits on the grounds that Musk was looking to manipulate stock prices and ambush short sellers with his tweet.

Musk’s tweet initially sent Tesla stock spiking, before it closed the day up 11 percent. The CEO followed up with a letter on the company blog, calling the move to go private ""the best path forward."" He promised to retain his stake in the company, and added that he would create a special fund to help all current investors remain on board.

Six days later, Musk sought to clarify his position with a statement in which he pointed to discussions with the managing director of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund as the source of his ""funding secured"" declaration. He later tweeted that he was working on a proposal to take Tesla private with Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake as financial advisers.

The saga took a bizarre turn that day when rapper Azealia Banks wrote on Instagram that, as a guest at Musk's home at the time, she learned that he was under the influence of LSD when he fired off his headline-grabbing tweet. Banks said she overheard Musk making phone calls to drum up the funding he promised was already in place.

The news quickly turned serious again when it was reported that Tesla's outside directors had retained two law firms to deal with the SEC inquiry and the CEO's plans to take the company private.

On August 24, one day after meeting with the board, Musk announced that he had reversed course and would not be taking the company private. Among his reasons, he cited the preference of most directors to keep Tesla public, as well as the difficulty of retaining some of the large shareholders who were prohibited from investing in a private company. Others suggested that Musk was also influenced by the poor optics of an electric car company being funded by Saudi Arabia, a country heavily involved in the oil industry.

On September 29, 2018, it was announced that Musk would pay a $20 million fine and step down as chairman of Tesla's board for three years as part of an agreement with the SEC.

In August 2013, Musk released a concept for a new form of transportation called the ""Hyperloop,"" an invention that would foster commuting between major cities while severely cutting travel time. Ideally resistant to weather and powered by renewable energy, the Hyperloop would propel riders in pods through a network of low-pressure tubes at speeds reaching more than 700 mph. Musk noted that the Hyperloop could take from seven to 10 years to be built and ready for use.

Although he introduced the Hyperloop with claims that it would be safer than a plane or train, with an estimated cost of $6 billion — approximately one-tenth of the cost for the rail system planned by the state of California — Musk's concept has drawn skepticism. Nevertheless, the entrepreneur has sought to encourage the development of this idea.

After he announced a competition for teams to submit their designs for a Hyperloop pod prototype, the first Hyperloop Pod Competition was held at the SpaceX facility in January 2017. A speed record of 284 mph was set by a German student engineering team at competition No. 3 in 2018, with the same team pushing the record to 287 mph the next year.

Musk has pursued an interest in artificial intelligence, becoming co-chair of the nonprofit OpenAI. The research company launched in late 2015 with the stated mission of advancing digital intelligence to benefit humanity.

In 2017, it was also reported that Musk was backing a venture called Neuralink, which intends to create devices to be implanted in the human brain and help people merge with software. He expanded on the company's progress during a July 2019 discussion, revealing that its devices will consist of a microscopic chip that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone.

In late November 2017, after Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel asked for proposals to build and operate a high-speed rail line that would transport passengers from O'Hare Airport to downtown Chicago in 20 minutes or less, Musk tweeted that he was all-in on the competition with The Boring Company. He said that the concept of the Chicago loop would be different from his Hyperloop, its relatively short route not requiring the need for drawing a vacuum to eliminate air friction.

In summer 2018 Musk announced he would cover the estimated $1 billion needed to dig the 17-mile tunnel from the airport to downtown Chicago. However, in late 2019 he tweeted that TBC would focus on completing the commercial tunnel in Las Vegas before turning to other projects, suggesting that plans for Chicago would remain in limbo for the immediate future.

Musk also reportedly found a market for The Boring Company's flamethrowers. After announcing they were going on sale for $500 apiece in late January 2018, he claimed to have sold 10,000 of them within a day.

In December 2016, Musk was named to President Donald Trump’s Strategy and Policy Forum; the following January, he joined Trump's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. Following Trump’s election, Musk found himself on common ground with the new president and his advisers as the president announced plans to pursue massive infrastructure developments.

While sometimes at odds with the president's controversial measures, such as a proposed ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, Musk defended his involvement with the new administration. ""My goals,"" he tweeted in early 2017, ""are to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization, a consequence of which will be the creating of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a more inspiring future for all.""

On June 1, following Trump's announcement that he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, Musk stepped down from his advisory roles.

Musk has been married twice. He wed Justine Wilson in 2000, and the couple had six children together. In 2002, their first son died at 10 weeks old from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Musk and Wilson had five additional sons together: twins Griffin and Xavier (born in 2004) and triplets Kai, Saxon and Damian (born in 2006).

After a contentious divorce from Wilson, Musk met actress Talulah Riley. The couple married in 2010. They split in 2012 but married each other again in 2013. Their relationship ultimately ended in divorce in 2016.

Musk reportedly began dating actress Amber Heard in 2016 after finalizing his divorce with Riley and Heard finalized her divorce from Johnny Depp. Their busy schedules caused the couple to break up in August 2017; they got back together in January 2018 and split again one month later.

In May 2018, Musk began dating musician Grimes (born Claire Boucher). That month, Grimes announced that she had changed her name to “c,” the symbol for the speed of light, reportedly on the encouragement of Musk. Fans criticized the feminist performer for dating a billionaire whose company has been described as a “predator zone” among accusations of sexual harassment.

The couple discussed their love for one another in a March 2019 feature in the Wall Street Journal Magazine, with Grimes saying “Look, I love him, he’s great...I mean, he’s a super-interesting goddamn person.” Musk, for his part, told the Journal, “I love c’s wild fae artistic creativity and hyper intense work ethic.”

Grimes gave birth to their son on May 4, 2020, with Musk announcing that they had named the boy ""X Æ A-12."" Later in the month, after it was reported that the State of California wouldn't accept a name with a number, the couple said they were changing their son's name to ""X Æ A-Xii.""

The boundless potential of space exploration and the preservation of the future of the human race have become the cornerstones of Musk's abiding interests, and toward these he has founded the Musk Foundation, which is dedicated to space exploration and the discovery of renewable and clean energy sources.

In October 2019 Musk pledged to donate $1 million to the #TeamTrees campaign, which aims to plant 20 million trees around the world by 2020. He even changed his Twitter name to Treelon for the occasion.",mainstream
216,"Plastic isn’t bad for the environment because competing products such as paper packaging and fiber-based textiles are worse, an executive from Exxon Mobil Corp. said Thursday.

“From a sustainability viewpoint, plastic packaging beats alternatives,” Jack Williams, a senior vice president at Exxon, said at an investor presentation in New York, according to Bloomberg News.

The thrust of the argument is that plastics, which make for valuable vessels, are key to medical innovations and more, require less energy than other products to produce. Alternatives generate five times the amount of waste and use more water to produce, Williams claimed. Williams cited a study by researcher Franklin Associates and sponsored by the American Chemistry Council industry group.

Oil majors and chemical giants produce the building blocks that form plastic.

Total plastic waste in the oceans is expected to more than double by 2030 without significant policy changes, the International Energy Agency said in a 2018 report.

Read:Oil giant BP is latest to pledge net zero emissions by 2050

Exxon is also exploring ways to use more recycled material in its chemicals production and is funding efforts to improve waste management, it has said recently.

Meanwhile, Exxon earlier this week outlined how it is reducing the methane that its operations release into the atmosphere. The oil and gas giant, whose operations were responsible for a major methane leak in Ohio in 2018, is seeking to influence the way regulations are written. It’s hoping companies and government agencies adopt similar procedures and leverage the technology that Exxon itself has used to reduce methane emissions by 20% in some of its U.S. drilling operations over the past two years.

Last year, Exxon and other oil giants pushed back on the Trump EPA’s proposal to relax regulations on methane emissions as many had already invested in upgrades to satisfy emissions regulations enacted under former President Barack Obama.

Shares of Exxon, falling amid broad weakness throughout the energy sector, are down 28% in the year to date and down 38% over the past year.

257,"s the head of the United Nations, Secretary-General António Guterres works to solve the world’s thorniest issues from humanitarian crises to international terrorism knowing that the nature of these conflicts prevents any definitive resolution.

But climate change is different, he tells TIME.

As populist leaders around the globe have sowed doubts about multilateral institutions like the U.N., Guterres says that climate change, perhaps the biggest collective action problem, offers an opportunity like no other issue for the system to “prove its value.”

“We are involved in the prevention of conflicts, and we are involved in trying to solve Libya, Yemen, Syria, South Sudan. But those are areas in which what we can do is limited,” he said in a May 22 interview at the U.N. headquarters in New York. “Climate change is for me, clearly an area where the U.N. has the obligation to assume global leadership.”

Average global temperatures have risen 1°C since the start of the industrial era. And they will rise to about 3°C by the end of the century without new policies, according to an analysis from Climate Action Tracker.

Nonetheless Guterres says the system is working, pointing to the landmark Paris Agreement, agreed to by nearly 200 countries in 2015. In the lead up to that deal, countries announced concrete plans to reduce their emissions. In the agreement itself, they committed to work to keep temperature rise to “well below” 2°C and ideally to 1.5°C. Guterres also cited last year’s climate talks in Poland, where countries agreed on the rules to implement the deal, as an example of the U.N. bringing countries together to fight global warming.

Guterres hopes that the climate summit he is hosting this fall will be another opportunity for the world to tackle global warming — and this time bring commitments to reduce emissions closer in line with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5°C by the end of the century.

The purpose of the summit is not “to convene a conference to come to a consensus on a document,” he says. “It is to make country by country assume leadership and assume this ambition that is necessary.”

There are hints that this could work: just this week the United Kingdom committed to eliminating its carbon emissions by 2050 and Japan’s cabinet approved a plan to work to go carbon neutral. Last month, Germany too said it would work toward net zero emissions by 2050.

In response to a question about influencing governments that have been resistant to climate change, like the Trump Administration, Guterres said he has looked to encourage movements and people on the ground as a means to get governments into action.

“200 years ago, the decisions were made by the king,” he said. “Now more and more, we see government’s following public opinions.”

Guterres, who is on the cover of TIME this week, also discussed his recent visit to the Pacific, where he met with world leaders who are facing the effects of climate change firsthand. He described meeting a family in Tuvalu whose home is threatened by rising seas and recounted the call for urgent action he received from local leaders.

“The good thing about going to the Pacific is to see some of these people that we can rescue,” he said. “That gives us — an enormous, on one side moral obligation, but on the other enormous enthusiasm to do things.”

The excerpts below from TIME’s interview with Guterres have been lightly edited for clarity.

How does climate permeate through the portfolio of issues that you work on?

When you look into the agenda of the United Nations, you have a number of areas that are absolutely central to our activity, peace and security, etc. We are involved in the prevention of conflicts, and we are involved in trying to solve Libya, Yemen, Syria, South Sudan. But those are areas in which what we can do is limited.

We do everything we can… But as you know the Security Council is many times divided on these issues, so there’s a lot of damage control that needs to be done in order to seize all opportunities… It’s not an area where you can have easily a global leadership for a simple objective. And the same applies to several other questions.

Now, climate change is for me, clearly an area where the U.N. has the obligation to assume global leadership. There’s not a question of diplomacy… It’s absolutely essential for the planet, and we have the obligation to do everything we can to try to push this present situation to be reversed. And so this is clearly one of the areas where I believe the U.N. has the obligation to assume a global leadership and to try to push and to bring together everyone.

Do you see the destabilizing effect of climate as a threat to multilateralism?

On the contrary, I think climate change has, to a certain extent, boosted multilateralism in the sense that you had the Paris Agreement. Katowice was a success, compared to other areas. I think what’s now put more into question multilateralism in many societies are problems like the lack of capacity in the international community to properly manage migration, for instance. Climate change is not a problem for multilateralism, climate change is a problem for us all. But I think climate change offers an opportunity for multilateralism to prove its value.

How do you reconcile the dire situation in the Pacific with the sort of optimism or the inspiration that you might get from seeing their resilience?

I was for 10 years high commissioner for refugees. That was the best in my life: to be able to be in regular contact with the people in the most dramatic circumstances, and to be able to do something, and there it was clear I could do it, to do something that could change their lives…

Now, here it’s more difficult because it’s more complex but at least with climate change I have something in which if I am able to assume the leadership, I’m able to mobilize leaders and make them take the right decisions, lots of people will not die, lots of people will see their lives improved. It’s not as direct as high commissioner for refugees because there I would be there immediately, but the good thing about going to the Pacific is to see some of these people that we can rescue. And that gives us — an enormous, on one side moral obligation but on the other side enormous enthusiasm to do things.

How has your job changed dealing with cities and states and institutions and other things that are filling the void of some of these countries that might be lagging? And do you see that as part of your remit?

This is an intergovernmental organization, so we have to deal essentially with governments. And that is large part of the work. But it is true that more and more power is distributed in societies… It is clear that if you want to achieve results, you need to mobilize those that have an influence in the way decisions are made. 200 years ago, the decisions were made by the king and that was easy, convince the king…

Now more and more, we see governments following public opinions, and so looking at the polls and looking at these things. To deal directly with societies becomes more and more important to influence political decisions. And so I think it’s my obligation when we deal with issues like climate change that are global issues, to of course deal with governments, but to concentrate a lot of my time in dealing with those that can progressively shift public opinions to make governments necessarily follow.

One thing I hear from various ministers and leaders of some of these vulnerable countries is that some of the processes like with the Green Climate Fund, or even with the UNFCCC, where one country can drag down the process, have become very difficult to deal with that. Are there various reforms that you think would be helpful?

Our effort now is less in relation to these mechanisms of decision and more and more — that’s why we are convening the climate summit — to ask countries to do their part. We all know what needs to be done. I mean the scientific evidence is there. We all know what needs to be done, and so we are pushing countries. I must say I feel we are having some success, but of course it’s still early. We’ll see how the summit goes. But to push countries to come with their pledges because they will have to renew in 2020 their nationally determined contributions and according to the Paris Agreement this is done country by country so the appeal, especially to the most important interlocutors here, the G20, is country by country there are things you need to do and to convince them. And I have to say that this dialogue has been quite interesting and I am hopeful that this will produce results. It’s not to convene a conference to come to a consensus on a document. It is to make country by country assume leadership and assume this ambition that is necessary… So my feeling is that this is the moment, not to look into the bureaucratic procedures, but to really raise ambition and make decision makers understand that this is the battle of our lifetime.

What concrete expectations do you have from countries? They don’t need to come up with their new NDCs [Nationally Determined Contributions] yet, but you also want more than just rhetoric. What’s the line?

The objective is to have NDCs in 2020, because that’s when the NDCs are supposed to be renewed, that are fully compatible with 1.5 degrees at the end of the century… September is an impulse in that direction, and a mobilization of more and more countries in order to make them understand… It’s to create a movement and to involve the public opinion, involve the business community, to involve the cites. What we need now is to mobilize the public opinion, and to mobilize the governments, and to mobilize the key stake holders, the key actors, for a common understanding that we need to do it. I mean it’s a challenge. But one thing is clear: we cannot lose this battle.",mainstream
300,"A primary premise of the Paris Agreement is consensus on the need to strengthen the resilience to climate impacts, focusing on the poorest and most vulnerable. Poorer communities, particularly rural areas in developing countries, are less equipped to deal with increasing natural disasters; livelihoods are lost in already fragile economies, forcing people to leave their homes and, at times, sparking conflict over land and food sources. The UN is helping to enhance climate-resistance in vulnerable communities, through the introduction of improved farming techniques, development projects and better land management and development projects, all with an emphasis on strengthening resilience and adaptive capacities.

Somalia, where 70 per cent of the population is dependent on climate-sensitive agriculture and pastoralism for their livelihoods, is one such country where the UN and partners are implementing programmes to counter the increasing desertification impacting the nation. For conflict-prone Somalia, the scarcity of natural resources, mainly water, presents great challenges, making Somalis even more vulnerable to climate change. Innovation initiatives such as integrative farming training and the construction of dams and pools called ‘berkeds’ have helped to preserve livelihoods. Tapping into solar power has provided an affordable and reliable option for electricity for community hospitals and schools and enhanced preparedness for future emergencies.

One of the most comprehensive drought initiatives, as referenced in the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) 2018-2030 Strategic Framework, links environment and development to sustainable land management. It commits to restoring drought-affected land and improving the livelihoods of 1.3 million people. UNCCD collaborates with global partners to support expansive projects such as the Great Green Wall, which will revive land in the Sahel region of Africa alleviating such threats as climate change, drought, famine, conflict and migration, and increase food security and jobs. Once completed, the Great Green Wall expects to be the largest living structure on the planet, three times the size of the Great Barrier Reef.

Smaller initiatives undertaken in countries where flooding is escalating as a result of climate-change are no less effective and life-sustaining for the communities in which they are implemented. In Bangladesh, a nation particularly vulnerable to climate-change, deadly landslides have claimed the lives and livelihoods of many. UN Women came to the aid of local residents through the support of a programme that provided financial assistance to women as well as training in sustainable agriculture and livestock management. Likewise, in disaster-prone Viet Nam, where data indicate that an average of 400 lives are lost annually due to climate disasters, an established programme is helping to reduce fatalities by teaching residents advance preparations and long-term planning to reduce crop failure. While such programmes aim to build resilience to climate change-induced disasters, the impact is far-reaching, including helping to maintain stability in areas where lack of natural resources and resulting displacement can result in further instability and conflict.

After decades of poverty and underdevelopment, both countries are steadily rising up the socio-economic ladder, so it is critical to ensure climate change considerations are mainstreamed into development to prevent them from losing economic gains. The UN is supporting this goal in both Bangladesh and Viet Nam working with the Governments, at the national and local levels.

Once a seasonal occurrence, wildfires are increasing in frequency and size due to global warming with devastating effects resulting in loss of life, property, livelihoods, and biodiversity. Exacerbating the situation is that wildfires add greenhouse gases to the environment and destroy the trees that absorb carbon dioxide. More than ever, wildfire management is a critical tool in reducing the death and destruction of precious resources. Although covering a small amount of territory, South Africa’s Fynbos Biome contains nearly one fifth of all know African flowering plants and is dubbed as “global biodiversity hotspot.” The UNDP-supported ""Fynbos Fire Project"", with funding from the Global Environment Facility, is working to change the way wildfires are managed and to implement strategies to better cope with increasing wildfire risks and damages due to climate change.

The International Fund for Agriculture (IFAD) promotes better land management and farming practices to help reduce environmental degradation and lower greenhouse emissions. Proper farming methods can help to increase crop tolerance and reduce further environmental destruction.

IFAD maintains that smallholder farmers have a key role in fighting global warming through agricultural transformation. A number of initiatives, including the reduction of deforestation, which is frequently undertaken to make way for commercial agriculture, and reducing post-harvest losses, are a few interventions that IFAD has helped smallholder farmers to implement. As an International Financial Institution, IFAD helps mobilize funding for innovative projects that governments may not be able or willing to undertake alone, and to access expertise and new methods on better utilization of land and other natural resources. Partnering with the Global Environmental Fund, IFAD has helped to mobilize funding in 24 countries for projects that focus on climate change.",mainstream
552,"16-year-old Greta Thunberg became an instant darling of the Left when she gave a doomsday speech at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit in New York City, in which she berated the assembled world leaders, including President Trump, of ignoring “climate change” and proclaimed an imminent end of the world of “mass extinction” and the collapse of “entire ecosystems”.

Time magazine actually selected Thunberg to be Person of the Year — the youngest person ever to be so named. In November 2019, Thunberg’s adoring fans plastered her face onto a gigantic 60′ x 30′ mural in downtown San Francisco.

But there is every evidence that this 16-year-old girl is a puppet of shadowy adults behind the scenes. (See my post of Dec. 18, 2019: “Greta Thunberg: Puppet of the Year”)

Here is more evidence.

Greta Thunberg has a Facebook page that appears to be her page to which presumably she alone posts. Indeed, Facebook‘s “page transparency” shows her as the confirmed owner.

However, a recent software glitsch revealed that her father and a United Nations activist actually post on and run her Facebook page.

Facebook Pages give public figures, businesses, and other entities a presence on Facebook that isn’t tied to an individual profile. The accounts behind those pages are anonymous unless a Page owner opts to make the admins public. You can’t see, for example, the names of the people who post to Facebook on WIRED’s behalf. But a bug that was live from Thursday evening until Friday morning allowed anyone to easily reveal the accounts running a Page, essentially doxing anyone who posted to one…. All it took to exploit the bug was opening a target page and checking the edit history of a post. Facebook mistakenly displayed the account or accounts that made edits to each post, rather than just the edits themselves.

During the Facebook glitsch, enterprising netizens got to work and discovered that two adult men post as 16-year-old Greta on her Facebook page: Svante Thunberg and Adarsh Prathap (ZeroHedge).

Adarsh Prathap’s LinkedIn page says he was a “Youth Reporter” at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)’s 2017 UN Climate Change Conference (COP23) in Bonn, Germany. Prathap currently is the youth coordinator for Youth Engaged in Wetlands, which calls itself “an international youth team committed to the conservation, protection, and wise-use of wetlands”.

After her adult male puppeteers were uncovered, Greta Thunberg continues to insist that she writes all the content posted by her father and Prathap. 😎

294,"The path of future climate change will depend on what courses of action are taken by society—in particular the emission of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. A range of alternative emissions scenarios known as representative concentration pathways (RCPs) were proposed by the IPCC in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), which was published in 2014, to examine potential future climate changes. The scenarios depend on various assumptions concerning future rates of human population growth, economic development, energy demand, technological advancement, and other factors. Unlike the scenarios used in previous IPCC assessments, the AR5 RCPs explicitly account for climate change mitigation efforts.

Graph of the predicted increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in Earth's atmosphere according to a series of climate change scenarios that assume different levels of economic development, population growth, and fossil fuel use.

The results of each scenario in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (2007) are depicted in the graph.

The AR5 scenario with the smallest increases in greenhouse gases is RCP 2.6, which denotes the net radiative forcing by 2100 in watts per square metre (a doubling of CO concentrations from preindustrial values of 280 ppm to 560 ppm represents roughly 3.7 watts per square metre). RCP 2.6 assumes substantial improvements in energy efficiency, a rapid transition away from fossil fuel energy, and a global population that peaks at roughly nine billion people in the 21st century. In that scenario CO concentrations remain below 450 ppm and actually fall toward the end of the century (to about 420 ppm) as a result of widespread deployment of carbon-capture technology.

Scenario RCP 8.5, by contrast, might be described as “business as usual.” It reflects the assumption of an energy-intensive global economy, high population growth, and a reduced rate of technological development. CO concentrations are more than three times greater than preindustrial levels (roughly 936 ppm) by 2100 and continue to grow thereafter. RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 envision intermediate policy choices, resulting in stabilization by 2100 of CO concentrations at 538 and 670 ppm, respectively. In all those scenarios, the cooling effect of industrial pollutants such as sulfate particulates, which have masked some of the past century’s warming, is assumed to decline to near zero by 2100 because of policies restricting their industrial production.

The differences between the various simulations arise from disparities between the various climate models used and from assumptions made by each emission scenario. For example, best estimates of the predicted increases in global surface temperature between the years 2000 and 2100 range from about 0.3 to 4.8 °C (0.5 to 8.6 °F), depending on which emission scenario is assumed and which climate model is used. Relative to preindustrial (i.e., 1750–1800) temperatures, these estimates reflect an overall warming of the globe of 1.4 to 5.0 °C (2.5 to 9.0 °F). These projections are conservative in that they do not take into account potential positive carbon cycle feedbacks (see above Feedback mechanisms and climate sensitivity). Only the lower-end emissions scenario RCP 2.6 has a reasonable chance (roughly 50 percent) of holding additional global surface warming by 2100 to less than 2.0 °C (3.6 °F)—a level considered by many scientists to be the threshold above which pervasive and extreme climatic effects will occur.

The greatest increase in near-surface air temperature is projected to occur over the polar region of the Northern Hemisphere because of the melting of sea ice and the associated reduction in surface albedo. Greater warming is predicted over land areas than over the ocean. Largely due to the delayed warming of the oceans and their greater specific heat, the Northern Hemisphere—with less than 40 percent of its surface area covered by water—is expected to warm faster than the Southern Hemisphere. Some of the regional variation in predicted warming is expected to arise from changes to wind patterns and ocean currents in response to surface warming. For example, the warming of the region of the North Atlantic Ocean just south of Greenland is expected to be slight. This anomaly is projected to arise from a weakening of warm northward ocean currents combined with a shift in the jet stream that will bring colder polar air masses to the region. projected changes in mean surface temperatures Projected changes in mean surface temperatures by the late 21st century according to the A1B climate change scenario. All values for the period 2090–99 are shown relative to the mean temperature values for the period 1980–99.

Increased precipitation is predicted in the polar and subpolar regions, whereas decreased precipitation is projected for the middle latitudes of both hemispheres as a result of the expected poleward shift in the jet streams. Whereas precipitation near the Equator is predicted to increase, it is thought that rainfall in the subtropics will decrease. Both phenomena are associated with a forecasted strengthening of the tropical Hadley cell pattern of atmospheric circulation. projected changes in mean precipitation Projected changes in mean precipitation by the late 21st century according to the A1B climate change scenario. All values for the period 2090–99 are shown as a percentage relative to the mean precipitation values for the period 1980–99. Changes in precipitation patterns are expected to increase the chances of both drought and flood conditions in many areas. Decreased summer precipitation in North America, Europe, and Africa, combined with greater rates of evaporation due to warming surface temperatures, is projected to lead to decreased soil moisture and drought in many regions. Furthermore, since anthropogenic climate change will likely lead to a more vigorous hydrologic cycle with greater rates of both evaporation and precipitation, there will be a greater probability for intense precipitation and flooding in many regions.

Regional predictions of future climate change remain limited by uncertainties in how the precise patterns of atmospheric winds and ocean currents will vary with increased surface warming. For example, some uncertainty remains in how the frequency and magnitude of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events will adjust to climate change. Since ENSO is one of the most prominent sources of interannual variations in regional patterns of precipitation and temperature, any uncertainty in how it will change implies a corresponding uncertainty in certain regional patterns of climate change. For example, increased El Niño activity would likely lead to more winter precipitation in some regions, such as the desert southwest of the United States. This might offset the drought predicted for those regions, but at the same time it might lead to less precipitation in other regions. Rising winter precipitation in the desert southwest of the United States might exacerbate drought conditions in locations as far away as South Africa.",mainstream

Scientists have warned that if urgent action to drastically reduce carbon emissions is not taken in the next 10 years, the damage done cannot be reversed.

The problem can be fixed. As a planet we have many of the technologies and resources we need to change the course we are on. However, we do not under estimate the scale of the challenge - this is more than just stopping the use of plastic straws. We need a fundamental rethink of how we all impact our planet and how sustainable that is for future generations.

325,"A university “sustainability director” is telling students to consider not buying Christmas presents this year because they might contribute to the “carbon footprint.”

Additionally, the director for William & Mary’s sustainability office said that if students do buy Christmas presents, they should consider not wrapping them and that they should even forego giving out Christmas cards.

“We’re trying to keep in mind that our carbon footprint is something that can expand during the holidays,” the director, Calandra Waters Lake, told a campus reporter. “And so how can we be wise about that through our purchases, through food that we eat, through the activities that we’re doing? Just trying to keep that in mind even though things get busy around the holidays.”

A few of her tips include:

“Step back and remember that the reason for the gift is to show someone you care. So, is buying a gift the best way to do that? Going out and doing something with the recipient to spend time with them may be a better option.”

“Possibly send paper holiday cards only to those who really appreciate receiving them, and go with e-cards for everybody else.”

“Because food can be a large part of one’s carbon, or greenhouse gas, footprint, make the most of the item. Purchasing food that is humanely raised and organic is part of that.”

Ironically, however, some of her other tips are actually quite useful in terms of combating materialism and consumerism, even if that wasn’t exactly the intent:

“If you’re going to give an item, decide whether it’s something you will make or purchase. Either way, evaluate both to consider whether the recipient is actually going to use the gift or if it’s just going to be one more thing.”

“Consider the clutter factor when making final gifting decisions. Food or other consumables such as handmade soaps are good options, and farmers markets are good resources for unique local items that come with little packaging.”

Unfortunately, rampant consumerism isn’t usually addressed head-on despite the annual fights on Black Friday over electronic slave goods made in overseas factories surrounded by suicide nets.

746,"The policy challenge is to act in a serious and sensible way, given the limits of our knowledge. While scientific uncertainties remain, we can begin now to address the factors that contribute to climate change.

President Bush is addressing the complex and important issue of global climate change with an ambitious strategy: slow the rate of increase in greenhouse gas emissions, and then, as the science justifies, stop  and then reverse  the accumulation of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. In February 2002, the President affirmed his commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its central goal of stabilizing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.

The Presidents strategy includes several bold initiatives that incorporate scientific research, technological innovation, and international cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while strengthening the economy. Through public-private partnerships, the President is working with businesses to encourage voluntary, cost-effective greenhouse gas emission reductions. The President is also investing in carbon sequestration technologies and practices that can capture carbon dioxide from fossil energy systems or the atmosphere, and store those greenhouse gases in forests, plants, and soils, or in geologic reservoirs underground.

In February 2002, President Bush committed the United States to a comprehensive strategy to reduce the greenhouse gas emission intensity of the American economy by 18 percent by 2012. Meeting this commitment will prevent more than 500 million metric tons of carbon-equivalent emissions through 2012, the equivalent of taking 70 million cars off the road. This step will set America on a path to slow the growth of our greenhouse gas emissions and, as science justifies, to stop and then reverse the growth of emissions.

Recognizing the importance of the climate change issue, President Bush has created an interagency, Cabinet-level committee, co-chaired by the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy, to coordinate and prioritize Federal research on global climate science and advance cleaner energy technologies. This Committee develops policy recommendations for the President and oversees the sub-cabinet interagency programs on climate science and energy technologies.

The President requests nearly $2 billion in his FY 2005 budget for climate science research, with $238 million for the Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI), a 42 percent increase over the FY 2004 enacted level. Energy Secretary Abraham, Commerce Secretary Evans, and White House Science Adviser Marburger released a 10-Year comprehensive Strategic Plan for the U.S. Climate Change

Science Program in July 2003. The plan describes a strategy for developing knowledge of variability and change in climate and related environmental and human systems, and for encouraging the application of this knowledge. Secretary Evans also announced a $103 million two-year Federal initiative to accelerate the deployment of new global observation technologies, focused on oceans, atmospheric aerosols, and the carbon cycle. After reviewing the Strategic Plan, the National Research Council commended its scope and content, stating that [t]he plan articulates a guiding vision, is appropriately ambitious, and is broad in scope. It encompasses activities related to areas of longstanding importance as well as new or enhanced cross disciplinary efforts. Advancing science on all fronts identified by the program will be of vital importance to the nation.

The Federal Government administers many different voluntary programs on energy efficiency, agricultural practices, and greenhouse gas reductions. Major initiatives announced by the Bush Administration include:

Climate VISION Partnership: In February 2003, President Bush announced that companies from twelve major industrial sectors and the membership of the Business Roundtable had committed to work with four of his Cabinet agencies (DOE, EPA, DOT, and USDA) to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade. Participating industries included Americas electric utilities; petroleum refiners and natural gas producers; automobile, iron and steel, chemical and magnesium manufacturers; forest and paper producers; railroads; and the cement, mining, aluminum, and semiconductor industries. In December 2003, the Department of Energy established an official Climate VISION Web site (www.climatevision.gov) to serve as an information clearinghouse for the program.

Climate Leaders: Announced in 2002, Climate Leaders is an EPA partnership encouraging individual companies to develop long-term, comprehensive climate change strategies. Partners set corporate-wide GHG reduction goals and inventory their emissions to measure progress. Fifty major companies are now participating, including General Motors, Alcoa, BP, Pfizer, Staples, International Paper, IBM, Miller Brewing, Eastman Kodak, and Target.

In June 2003, Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman announced that consideration will be given to conservation practices that store carbon when implementing USDAs forest and agriculture conservation programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). USDA would provide financial incentives, technical assistance, demonstrations, pilot programs, education and capacity building, along with measurements to assess the success of these efforts.

In December 2003, DOE proposed guidelines for the voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and reduction efforts under the program established by section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. By encouraging complete reports on the greenhouse gas emissions of all participants in the program, these guidelines would improve the accuracy and verifiability of greenhouse gas emission data reported under the registry. In addition, the revised guidelines will provide a means for entities that are able to meet these additional requirements to register greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and gain recognition for their efforts to help meet the President's goal for reducing U.S. emissions intensity by 18 percent between 2002 and 2012. Through this program, major U.S. companies and institutions will be encouraged to comprehensively review and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. This proposal is another key component of the Bush Administrations efforts to address the complex, important issue of global climate change.

The United States is engaged in extensive international efforts on climate, both through multilateral and bilateral activities. Multilaterally, the United States is by far the largest financial provider for the activities of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The United States also leads R & D projects through the Generation IV International Forum, which is developing the next generation nuclear systems to produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Bilaterally, the United States has developed a number of agreements with major international partners to pursue research on global climate change and deploy climate observation systems, collaborate on energy and sequestration technologies, and explore methodologies for monitoring and measuring GHG emissions. To date, new bilateral agreements have been established with countries representing over 70 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions: Australia, Japan, China, India, Italy, Canada, Russia, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Mexico, the European Union, Brazil, CONCAUSA, an organization of seven Central American countries, and South Africa.

Earth Observation Summit: The first-ever Earth Observation Summit was held July 31, 2003, to generate strong, international support to link thousands of individual technological assets into a coordinated, sustained, and comprehensive global Earth observation system. The purpose of the system is to provide the observations needed to substantially improve our ability to identify and address critical environmental, economic, and societal concerns. Throughout the world, individual systems have already demonstrated their value, from estimating crop yields to monitoring water and air quality to improving airline safety. We have limited knowledge, however, of how to address concerns such as drought, disease outbreaks, stronger agricultural production, and energy and transportation challenges. International cooperation can provide the tools needed to address these scientific uncertainties. More than 30 countries and 20 international organizations participated in the Summit. Participants adopted a Summit Declaration recognizing the need to minimize data gaps and maximize the utility of the observations, and established an intergovernmental group to develop the implementation plan.

The second Earth Observation Summit was held in Tokyo in April 2004. NOAA administrator Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher and EPA administrator Michael Leavitt both represented the United States. There are currently 48 international partners.

For more information, visit the EPA's GEOSS Web site and NOAA's Web site.

Global Environmental Facility (GEF): The Bush Administration pledged $500 million to the GEF over the next four years (the largest contribution of any country, and almost a quarter of worldwide spending) to help developing countries address environmental problems, including global climate change. The GEF is the financial mechanism under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This commitment, which will fund technology transfer and capacity building in developing countries, for environmental purposes, represents a 16 percent increase over the U.S. contribution in the previous replenishment.

Tropical Forest Conservation and the Congo Basin Forest Partnership: In FY 2003, the Bush Administration directed $50 million for tropical forest conservation. These funds provide the resources needed to pursue additional debt-for-nature projects under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act and for the Congo Basin Forest Partnership launched by Secretary of State Powell and former EPA Administrator Whitman in September 2002 to preserve eleven key landscapes in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo. On February 13, 2004, President Bush signed the Congo Basin Forest Partnership Act, authorizing appropriations to carry out the Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP) program.

In July 2003, Secretary of State Powell launched the Presidents Initiative Against Illegal Logging, which assists developing countries in their efforts to combat illegal logging, including the sale and export of illegally harvested timber, and fighting corruption in the forest sector. This initiative represents the most comprehensive strategy undertaken by any nation to address this critical sustainable development challenge, and reinforces the U.S. leadership role in taking action to counter the problem, and preserve forest resources that store carbon.

575,"Climate policy is dangling between the cynicism of Donald Trump and the radicalism of Greta Thunberg. The US president has just pulled the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases out of the Paris climate accord. Ms Thunberg demands significantly more than a 50 per cent cut in global net emissions by 2030. The former is certainly irresponsible. But the latter seems inconceivable.

The exasperation of radical climate activists is understandable. Despite decades of talk, emissions of greenhouse gases and global temperatures continue to rise. If the trend does not alter soon, the chances of avoiding an increase in global average temperatures of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will be zero and those of avoiding a 2C increase will be tiny.

As the IMF notes in its latest Fiscal Monitor, meeting the latter goal requires reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by a third below the baseline, by 2030. To keep below a 1.5C increase, emissions need to be half of the baseline.

The longer the delay in acting, the larger the required action becomes, until nothing can be done because it will be too late. It is already almost too late to avoid what experts view as destructive and irreversible changes in climate. For that reason, dramatic policies are needed. Yet they are feasible, argues the Energy Transitions Commission, if they are firmly implemented over the next three decades.

Unfortunately, the outright opposition of people such as Mr Trump, and the indifference of much of the population, are not the sole obstacles to success. Even some who favour action are a problem, because the climate cause is for them part of a wider campaign against the market.

Thus, many supporters of the Green New Deal view climate as a justification for the planned economy. As British journalist Paul Mason argues: “Labour wants to combat climate change through three mechanisms: state spending, state lending and the state direction of private finance.” This approach allows opponents to argue that the left is more concerned with destroying market economies than saving the planet. The mess created by trying to plan an economy into zero net emissions in a decade might bring all attempts at mitigation into disrepute.

In any case, climate change will not be solved by one country. To succeed, policy must be effective, legitimate and global.

To be effective, policy must combine planning, regulation, research and incentives. There is strong justification for government actions in research, spatial planning and finance. But there is also a need for incentives aimed at shifting behaviour. Command and control are rarely as effective all on their own.

The IMF report suggests $75 a tonne of carbon might be the price in 2030 consistent with keeping the temperature increase below 2C. Today, while there are a host of pricing arrangements, the prices themselves are mostly far too low and variable over time and across countries to be useful. Yet, in principle, a carbon tax, or an emissions trading system with a price floor, is the most effective (because most comprehensive) way to influence emissions.

Schemes that generate fiscal revenue ought also to be attractive to politicians, because the money can be used for other valuable purposes. Taxing a “bad” (a form of pollution, in this case) always offers an opportunity to improve taxation or raise valuable spending.

An important point made by the IMF report is that such countries as China and India could benefit especially from a reduction in local environmental pollution, because of the benefits of reduced use of coal. It is also vital that these countries do see such benefits from use of carbon taxes, because they are going to have to play a big part in bringing about the needed reductions in global emissions (relative to the baseline). It is in these countries, too, that a huge part of the needed investment in new energy systems must be made. So incentives matter greatly.

To make policy legitimate, it is essential to compensate losers. It is not true that the poor are always proportionately most adversely affected by higher energy prices. But protests by the rest of the population matter, too. Compensation for higher fuel prices needs to be visible. As important, a convincing vision of a better future must be offered. Otherwise, the necessary changes in policy will never be accepted.

Finally, policy has to be global, with all the bigger economies involved. This creates huge problems of equity. Clearly we are never going to reach a perfect solution. But some solution will have to be found in generous assistance from high-income countries to emerging and developing countries, especially with the introduction of new technologies. This also raises an important question: what is to be done with free-riders and, above all, the biggest free-rider of all, the rogue US? The answer in principle is clear: it will have to be penalised quite heavily. If we accept, as we should, the urgency of the challenge, this follows quite naturally.

What, then, is to be done? The answers include a programme of action over three decades, starting now; pragmatic resort to all policy tools, including market-based incentives; use of the revenue raised from carbon pricing to compensate losers and make the tax system and climate mitigation more efficient; a stress on the local environment benefits of eliminating the use of fossil fuels; and, above all, a commitment to climate as a shared global challenge. In an era of populism and nationalism, is there any chance of all this? Not obviously, alas. If so, we will indeed have failed. But the young are surely right to expect better.

The flight shaming movement has raised our awareness of air travel’s contribution to climate change. With all the discussion, you might be surprised to learn that air travel globally only accounts for about 3% of the warming human activities are causing. Why all the fuss?

Before I explain, I should come clean. I am writing this on the train from Christchurch to Kaikoura, where I will give a talk about my recent book #NoFly: walking the talk on climate change. I have some skin in this game.

Read more: Flight shame: flying less plays a small but positive part in tackling climate change

Taking a train around New Zealand is no mean feat. In the North Island, the train between Auckland and Wellington runs only every second day. If you get off at a stop along the way, you have to wait another two days to continue your journey. You can catch a bus, but you’ll spend that bus journey fantasising about the possibility of an overnight train service.

So why do it? A good deal of global carbon emissions come from industrial processes or electricity generation under the control of governments and corporations, rather than individual citizens. For many of us, a decision not to fly might be the most significant reduction in emissions we can make as individuals.

As Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has shown, refusing to fly also sends a powerful signal to others, by showing that you are willing to change your own behaviour. Politicians and corporate sales departments will take note if we start acting together.

Aviation affects the climate in a variety of ways.

Because any carbon dioxide you emit stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, it doesn’t matter much whether you release it from the exhaust pipe of your car at sea level or from a jet engine several kilometres high. Per passenger, a flight from Auckland to Wellington will put a similar amount of carbon dioxide into the air as driving solo in your car. Catching the train will cut your carbon emissions seven-fold.

When aircraft burn jet fuel, however, they also emit short-lived gases like nitrogen oxides, which can react with other gases in the air within a day of being released. When nitrogen oxides are released at altitude they can react with oxygen to put more ozone into the air, but can also remove methane.

Ozone and methane are both greenhouse gases, so this chain of chemical reactions can lead to both heating and cooling effects. Unfortunately the net result when these processes are added together is to drive more warming.

Depending on the atmospheric conditions, aircraft can also create contrails: clouds of tiny ice crystals. The science is not as clear cut on how contrails influence the climate, but some studies suggest they could have an effect as significant as the carbon dioxide released during a flight.

There is also considerable uncertainty as to whether aircraft exhaust might affect cloud formation itself - this could be a further significant contribution to warming.

Read more: Climate explained: why don't we have electric aircraft?

Offsetting, by planting trees or restoring natural wildlands, will take carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere. But we would have to do this on a massive scale to feed our appetite for flight.

Emissions from international air travel are not included in the Paris Agreement, although the United Nations has been working on the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which may begin to deal with these. Initially, the scheme will be voluntary. Airlines flying routes between countries that join the scheme will have to offset any emissions above 2020 levels from January 2021.

Emissions from flying stand to triple by 2050 if demand for air travel continues to grow. Even if air travel became carbon neutral through the use of biofuels or electric planes, the effects from contrails and interactions with clouds mean that flying may never be climate neutral.

With no easy fixes on the horizon, many people are thinking hard about their need to fly. This is why I took a year off air travel (alongside my colleague Quentin Atkinson) in 2018.

I have been back on planes in 2019, but I have learned how to reduce my flying, by combining trips and making better use of video conferencing.

Fly if you must, offset if you can, but – if you are concerned about climate change – one of the best things you could choose to do is to fly less.",mainstream
857,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Almost half of all Europeans fear climate change more than losing a job or of a terrorist attack, a study by the European Investment Bank (EIB) showed on Thursday as EU lawmakers declared a “climate emergency”.

The symbolic vote by lawmakers was designed to pressure for action against global warming at an upcoming United Nations summit..

The EIB survey of 30,000 respondents from 30 countries, including China and the United States, showed 47% of Europeans saw climate change as the number one threat in their lives, above unemployment, large scale migration and concerns about terrorism.

“European citizens are highly concerned about climate change and its impact on their everyday life and future,” said Emma Navarro, EIB Vice-President responsible for climate action and the environment.

“Interestingly, many of them are optimistic about the possibility to reverse it. Unfortunately, science says otherwise. We have one shot at limiting global warming and mitigating its effects,” she said.

The EIB, owned by European Union governments, is the world’s largest international public lending institution and has the task of financing climate-change related investment that is a priority for the new European Commission.

The survey, the first of four planned by the EIB, showed the level of concern about climate change was even higher in China than the EU, with 73% of respondents seeing it as the biggest threat to society, compared to 39% in the United States, where most people worried more about access to health services.

The study also showed that 41% of young Europeans between the age of 15 and 29, especially from southern countries like Spain, Greece and France thought they would have to move to another country because of the changing climate.

“Overall, 82% of Europeans report that climate change has an impact on their everyday lives, a perception that goes up to 98% in China and 76% in the United States,” the study said.

The incoming European Commission, which will start on Dec 1, wants to make the whole of the European Union an area that is neutral in terms of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 after slashing emissions by 50% by 2030. It still requires the consent of all EU governments before such a target becomes binding, but some countries which still heavily depend on coal like Poland, oppose such ambition.",mainstream
490,"Asthma can be hard to diagnose. Your child's doctor will consider the symptoms and their frequency and your child's medical history. Your child might need tests to rule out other conditions and to identify the most likely cause of the symptoms.

A number of childhood conditions can have symptoms similar to those caused by asthma. To complicate the issue further, these conditions also commonly occur with asthma. So your child's doctor will have to determine whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma, a condition other than asthma, or both asthma and another condition.

Conditions that can cause asthma-like symptoms include:
• Respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)

The following are tests your child might need.
• Lung function tests (spirometry). Doctors diagnose asthma with the same tests used to identify the disease in adults. Spirometry measures how much air your child can exhale and how quickly. Your child might have lung function tests at rest, after exercising and after taking asthma medication. Another lung function test is brochoprovocation. Using spirometry, this test measures how your lungs react to certain provocations, such as exercise or exposure to cold air.
• Exhaled nitric oxide test. If the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain after lung function tests, your doctor might recommend measuring the level of nitric oxide in an exhaled sample of your child's breath. Nitric oxide testing can also help determine whether steroid medications might be helpful for your child's asthma.

The asthma tests used, however, aren't accurate before 5 years of age. For younger children, your doctor will rely on information you and your child provide about symptoms. Sometimes a diagnosis can't be made until later, after months or even years of observing symptoms.

If your child seems to have asthma that's triggered by allergies, the doctor might recommend allergy skin testing. During a skin test, the skin is pricked with extracts of common allergy-causing substances, such as animal dander, mold or dust mites, and observed for signs of an allergic reaction.

Initial treatment depends on the severity of your child's asthma. The goal of asthma treatment is to keep symptoms under control, meaning that your child has:
• Few or no asthma flare-ups
• No limitations on physical activities or exercise
• Minimal use of quick-relief (rescue) inhalers, such as albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)
• Few or no side effects from medications

Treating asthma involves both preventing symptoms and treating an asthma attack in progress. The right medication for your child depends on a number of things, including age, symptoms, asthma triggers and what seems to work best to keep his or her asthma under control.

For children younger than age 3 who have mild symptoms of asthma, the doctor might use a wait-and-see approach. This is because the long-term effects of asthma medication on infants and young children aren't clear.

However, if an infant or toddler has frequent or severe wheezing episodes, a medication might be prescribed to see if it improves symptoms.

Preventive, long-term control medications reduce the inflammation in your child's airways that leads to symptoms. In most cases, these medications need to be taken daily.
• Inhaled corticosteroids. These medications include fluticasone (Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), mometasone (Asmanex HFA), ciclesonide (Alvesco), beclomethasone (Qvar Redihaler) and others. Your child might need to use these medications for several days to weeks before getting the full benefit. Long-term use of these medications has been associated with slightly slowed growth in children, but the effect is minor. In most cases, the benefits of good asthma control outweigh the risks of possible side effects.
• Leukotriene modifiers. These oral medications include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo). They help prevent asthma symptoms for up to 24 hours.
• Combination inhalers. These medications contain an inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting beta agonist (LABA). They include fluticasone and salmeterol (Advair Diskus, Advair HFA), budesonide and formoterol (Symbicort), fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta), and mometasone and formoterol (Dulera). In some situations, long-acting beta agonists have been linked to severe asthma attacks. For this reason, LABA medications should always be given to a child with an inhaler that also contains a corticosteroid. These combination inhalers should be used only for asthma that's not well-controlled by other medications.
• Theophylline. This is a daily pill that helps keep the airways open. Theophylline (Theo-24) relaxes the muscles around the airways to make breathing easier. It's mostly used with inhaled steroids. If you take this drug, you'll need to have your blood checked regularly.
• Immunomodulatory agents. Mepolizumab (Nucala), dupilumab (Dupixent) and benralizumab (Fasenra) might be appropriate for children over the age of 12 who have severe eosinophilic asthma. Omalizumab (Xolair) can be considered for children age 6 or older who have moderate to severe allergic asthma.

Quick-relief medications quickly open swollen airways. Also called rescue medications, quick-relief medications are used as needed for rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma attack — or before exercise if your child's doctor recommends it.
• Short-acting beta agonists. These inhaled bronchodilator medications can rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) and levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA). These medications act within minutes, and effects last several hours.
• Oral and intravenous corticosteroids. These medications relieve airway inflammation caused by severe asthma. Examples include prednisone and methylprednisolone. They can cause serious side effects when used long term, so they're only used to treat severe asthma symptoms on a short-term basis.

If your child's asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies, your child might benefit from allergy treatment, such as the following, as well:
• Omalizumab (Xolair). This medication is for people who have allergies and severe asthma. It reduces the immune system's reaction to allergy-causing substances, such as pollen, dust mites and pet dander. Xolair is delivered by injection every two to four weeks.
• Allergy medications. These include oral and nasal spray antihistamines and decongestants as well as corticosteroid, cromolyn and ipratropium nasal sprays.
• Allergy shots (immunotherapy). Immunotherapy injections are generally given once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years. Over time, they gradually reduce your child's immune system reaction to specific allergens.

Long-term asthma control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone of asthma treatment. These medications keep asthma under control and make it less likely that your child will have an asthma attack.

If your child does have an asthma flare-up, a quick-relief (rescue) inhaler can ease symptoms right away. But if long-term control medications are working properly, your child shouldn't need to use a quick-relief inhaler very often.

Keep a record of how many puffs your child uses each week. If he or she frequently needs to use a quick-relief inhaler, take your child to see the doctor. You probably need to adjust the long-term control medication.

Inhaled short- and long-term control medications are used by inhaling a measured dose of medication.
• Older children and teens might use a small, hand-held device called a pressurized metered dose inhaler or an inhaler that releases a fine powder.
• Infants and toddlers need to use a face mask attached to a metered dose inhaler or a nebulizer to get the correct amount of medication.
• Babies need to a use a device that turns liquid medication into fine droplets (nebulizer). Your baby wears a face mask and breathes normally while the nebulizer delivers the correct dose of medication.

Work with your child's doctor to create a written asthma action plan. This can be an important part of treatment, especially if your child has severe asthma. An asthma action plan can help you and your child:
• Recognize when you need to adjust long-term control medications
• Determine how well treatment is working
• Identify the signs of an asthma attack and know what to do when one occurs
• Know when to call a doctor or seek emergency help

Children who have enough coordination and understanding might use a hand-held device to measure how well they can breathe (peak flow meter). A written asthma action plan can help you and your child remember what to do when peak flow measurements reach a certain level.

The action plan might use peak flow measurements and symptoms to categorize your child's asthma into zones, such as the green zone, yellow zone and red zone. These zones correspond to well-controlled symptoms, somewhat-controlled symptoms and poorly controlled symptoms. This makes tracking your child's asthma easier.

Your child's symptoms and triggers are likely to change over time. You'll need to observe symptoms and work with the doctor to adjust medications as needed.

If your child's symptoms are completely controlled for a time, your child's doctor might recommend lowering doses or stopping asthma medications (step-down treatment). If your child's asthma isn't as well-controlled, the doctor might want to increase, change or add medications (step-up treatment).

Explore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.

Taking steps to reduce your child's exposure to asthma triggers will lessen the possibility of asthma attacks. Steps to help avoid triggers vary depending on what triggers your child's asthma. Here are some things that may help:
• Maintain low humidity at home. If you live in a damp climate, talk to your child's doctor about using a device to keep the air drier (dehumidifier).
• Keep indoor air clean. Have a heating and air conditioning professional check your air conditioning system every year. Change the filters in your furnace and air conditioner according to the manufacturer's instructions. Also consider installing a small-particle filter in your ventilation system.
• Reduce pet dander. If your child is allergic to dander, it's best to avoid pets with fur or feathers. If you have pets, regularly bathing or grooming your pets also might reduce the amount of dander. Keep pets out of your child's room.
• Use your air conditioner. Air conditioning helps reduce the amount of airborne pollen from trees, grasses and weeds that finds its way indoors. Air conditioning also lowers indoor humidity and can reduce your child's exposure to dust mites. If you don't have air conditioning, try to keep your windows closed during pollen season.
• Keep dust to a minimum. Reduce dust that can aggravate nighttime symptoms by replacing certain items in your bedroom. For example, encase pillows, mattresses and box springs in dustproof covers. Consider removing carpeting and installing hard flooring, particularly in your child's bedroom. Use washable curtains and blinds.
• Clean regularly. Clean your home at least once a week to remove dust and allergens.
• Reduce your child's exposure to cold air. If your child's asthma is worsened by cold, dry air, wearing a face mask outside can help.

While some alternative remedies are used for asthma, in most cases more research is needed to see how well they work and to determine possible side effects. Alternative treatments to consider include:
• Breathing techniques. These include structured breathing programs, such as the Buteyko breathing technique, the Papworth method and yoga breathing exercises (pranayama).
• Relaxation techniques. Techniques such as meditation, biofeedback, hypnosis and progressive muscle relaxation might help with asthma by reducing tension and stress.
• Herbal remedies and supplements. A few herbal remedies have been tried for asthma, including black seed, fish oil and magnesium. However, further studies are needed to assess their benefit and safety. Herbs and supplements can have side effects and can interact with other medications your child is taking. Talk to your child's doctor before trying any herbs or supplements.

It can be stressful to help your child manage asthma. Keep these tips in mind to make life as normal as possible:
• Make treatment a regular part of life. If your child has to take daily medication, don't make a big deal out of it — it should be as routine as eating breakfast or brushing teeth.
• Use a written asthma action plan. Work with your child's doctor to develop your child's action plan, and give a copy to all of your child's caregivers, such as child care providers, teachers, coaches and the parents of your child's friends. Following a written plan can help you and your child identify symptoms early, providing important information on how to treat your child's asthma from day to day and how to deal with an asthma attack.
• Be encouraging. Focus attention on what your child can do, not on limitations. Involve teachers, school nurses, coaches, relatives and friends in helping your child manage asthma. Encourage normal play and activity. Don't limit your child's activities out of fear of an asthma attack — work with your child's doctor to control exercise-induced symptoms.
• Be calm and in control. Don't get rattled if asthma symptoms worsen. Focus on your child's asthma action plan, and involve your child in each step so that he or she understands what's happening.
• Talk to other parents of children with asthma. Chat rooms and message boards on the internet or a local support group can connect you with parents facing similar challenges.
• Help your child connect with others who have asthma. Send your child to ""asthma camp"" or find other organized activities for children with asthma. This can help your child feel less isolated and gain a better understanding of asthma and its treatment.

You're likely to start by taking your child to your family doctor or your child's pediatrician. However, when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred to an allergist, lung doctor (pulmonologist) or other specialist. Here's some information to help you get ready for your child's appointment.

What you can do
• Your child's symptoms, how severe they are and when they occur. Note when symptoms bother your child most — for example, if symptoms tend to get worse at certain times of the day; during certain seasons; when your child is exposed to cold air, pollen or other triggers; or when he or she is playing hard or participating in sports.
• Key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes your child has had.
• All medications, vitamins and supplements your child takes, including doses.
• Write down questions to ask the doctor.

For asthma or asthma-like symptoms, questions to ask your doctor include:
• Is asthma the most likely cause of my child's breathing problems?
• What else could be causing my child's symptoms?
• What tests does my child need?
• Is my child's condition likely temporary or chronic?
• What treatment do you suggest?
• My child has these other health conditions. How can we best manage them together?
• Are there restrictions my child needs to follow?
• Should my child see a specialist?
• Are there brochures or other printed materials I can have? What websites do you recommend?

Don't hesitate to ask other questions.

What to expect from your child's doctor

The doctor is likely to ask questions, including:
• When did you notice your child's symptoms?
• Does your child have difficulty breathing most of the time or only at certain times or in certain situations?
• Does your child have allergies such as hay fever?
• What, if anything, appears to worsen your child's symptoms?
• What, if anything, seems to improve your child's symptoms?
• Do allergies or asthma run in your child's family?",mainstream
1044,"Republicans looking to counter the Green New Deal are planning a climate change proposal of their own, taking a multi-pronged approach to improving the environment.

The effort, according to Axios, is being spearheaded by House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., alongside Reps. Garret Graves, R-La., and Bruce Westerman R-Ark. McCarthy held a caucus event on climate change Thursday, and appears to be taking action that counters critics who believe the GOP is not concerned with environmental issues.

""If you look at this conference today, we just had a whole event talking about the environment, not because someone is driving us but because we care about it,"" he told Axios.

The proposed policies reportedly focus on three particular efforts. The first is the capturing of carbon dioxide emissions. Part of this includes what is being called the Trillion Trees Act, whereby legislation would look to increase the number of trees in the U.S., with the goal of using them for ""sequestering"" carbon. The congressmen are also looking to expand tax credits for companies that capture and store carbon dioxide.

The plan does not include emissions targets that are favored by Democrats. Graves claimed that setting ""arbitrary targets"" would be ""a mistake.""

The second part of the plan is the promotion of clean energy technology by doubling investment in clean air research and lowering taxes for companies that export clean air tech. Nuclear power and natural gas are also featured in the plan.

The third area of focus is conservation, especially when it comes to plastic. This includes cleaning up pollution from plastic, urging government labs to develop improved recycling methods, and directing foreign aid to nations whose rivers suffer the most from plastic pollution.

46,"An overwhelming body of scientific evidence now clearly indicates that climate change is a serious and urgent issue. The Earth's climate is rapidly changing, mainly as a result of increases in greenhouse gases caused by human activities.

Most climate models show that a doubling of pre-industrial levels of greenhouse gases is very likely to commit the Earth to a rise of between 2–5°C in global mean temperatures. This level of greenhouse gases will probably be reached between 2030 and 2060. A warming of 5°C on a global scale would be far outside the experience of human civilisation and comparable to the difference between temperatures during the last ice age and today. Several new studies suggest up to a 20% chance that warming could be greater than 5°C.

If annual greenhouse gas emissions remained at the current level, concentrations would be more than treble pre-industrial levels by 2100, committing the world to 3–10°C warming, based on the latest climate projections.

Some impacts of climate change itself may amplify warming further by triggering the release of additional greenhouse gases. This creates a real risk of even higher temperature changes.",mainstream
451,"Over 11,000 scientists around the world declare a 'climate emergency'

A global team of more than 11,000 scientists from over 150 countries officially declared that the world is in a ""climate emergency,"" according to a new paper released Tuesday.

“Scientists have a moral obligation to warn humanity of any great threat,” said Thomas Newsome of the University of Sydney, one of the paper's authors, in a statement. “From the data we have, it is clear we are facing a climate emergency.”

The scientists warned that “untold human suffering” is unavoidable without deep and lasting shifts in human activities that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and other factors related to climate change.

“Despite 40 years of major global negotiations, we have generally conducted business as usual and are essentially failing to address this crisis,” said William Ripple, a professor of ecology at Oregon State University and co-lead author of the paper. “Climate change has arrived and is accelerating faster than many scientists expected.”

This is the first time a group of scientists have come together to use the word ""emergency"" in regards to climate change.

The warning came with steps that can be taken to reverse negative trends, but the authors said it may take a groundswell of public pressure to convince political leaders to take corrective action. Since 1992, when more than 1,700 scientists signed a “World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity” published by the Union of Concerned Scientists, global trends have worsened.

“Global surface temperature, ocean heat content, extreme weather and its costs, sea level, ocean acidity, and area burned in the United States are all rising,” Ripple said. “Globally, ice is rapidly disappearing as demonstrated by decreases in minimum summer Arctic sea ice, Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and glacier thickness. All of these rapid changes highlight the urgent need for action.”

The paper concludes by saying, ""we believe that the prospects will be greatest if decision-makers and all of humanity promptly respond to this warning and declaration of a climate emergency, and act to sustain life on planet Earth, our only home.""

443,"Gone are the days when children worried about monsters under their bed at night, now it is the climate crisis outside that is giving them nightmares.

A new survey reveals one in five children are having bad dreams about the environmental changes, with 17 percent reporting their concerns are affecting their sleeping and eating habits.

The poll also shows 80 percent say the problem was important to them and nearly half do not trust adults to tackle the long-term problems.

The study, conducted by BBC Newsround in collaboration with Savanta-ComRes, surveyed 2,000 children in the UK from the ages of eight to 16 in a bid to see just how the younger generation feels about the changes to our planet.

Over the past year, millions of young people have flooded the streets of cities around the world demanding political leaders take urgent steps to stop climate change, inspired by 17-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.

The BBC Newsround conducted the new survey to know understand how the young generation feels about the impact climate change could have on their future.

The poll found that 73 percent of the participants are in constant worry about the planet's current state, including 22 percent who are 'very worried'.

Many adults have noted that the disastrous effects may not become a reality for many years, but it seems our children may be the ones to suffer the consequences.

Almost three in five, about 58 percent, of children are concerned about what climate changes means for their future.

And approximately 19 percent shared they are having nightmares about the climate crisis.

When questioned about the action being taken by grown-ups to tackle the problem, a large number of children said they feel frustrated about the progress being made.

Emma Citron, a consultant clinical child psychologist, said that young people often find it difficult to come to terms with the scale of the problem of climate changes and what often seems like a lack of response shown by governments and world leaders.

'Public figures like David Attenborough and Greta Thunberg have helped young people to voice their worries and we have to make sure that we as adults listen to them and ... help them become involved in positive change,' she said in a statement.

'We all need to support them not to feel hopeless but rather to present to them hopeful and balanced messages about their futures and ensure that they get the right professional help if their anxiety is unduly high.'

The American Psychological Association has said it was aware of reports of growing 'eco-anxiety' in children, but research was needed to establish how common it was.

Britain's Oxford Dictionaries recorded a 4,290 percent increase in the term 'eco-anxiety' in 2019, particularly among young people.

In September 2019, millions of people including hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren took to the streets in 150 different countries for the largest climate protest in history.

Global Strike 4 Climate Change' protesters were photographed in Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, India, Bangladesh, Uganda, Kenya, the Solomon Island, Cyprus, Poland, Germany and London and those living in America joined later in the day.

The protests were part of a snowballing movement sparked by teenage activist Greta Thunberg's school strikes outside the Swedish parliament.

It came ahead of a climate action summit in New York convened by UN secretary general Antonio Guterres to urge countries to up their climate efforts.

Much steeper measures are needed across the globe to prevent temperature rises of more than 1.5C (2.7F) or 2C (3.6F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

532,"Officials in Sweden and Germany are discussing imposing a tax on consumable meat to combat 'climate change' following a new IPCC report encouraging a plant-based diet, according to local media.

Politicians claim they hope to reduce CO2 emissions and improve animal welfare with a forced reduction in meat consumption.

""German politicians are speaking out in favor of raising the VAT on meat in a bid to improve animal welfare and cut CO2 emissions,"" the Local Germany reports.

""The decision makers want to raise the tax to the standard VAT, or 19 percent, up from the current seven percent that consumers are required to pay for meat products.""

Sweden may be looking to Germany as inspiration for their own similar ideas.

""Food production and forestry are fundamental to society,"" said Markku Rummukainen, Swedish representative to the UN Climate Panel. ""Protein from the plant kingdom has much less impact on the climate than protein from the animal kingdom. How to produce one or the other also plays a role, of course.""

""In order to achieve the global climate targets, measures and solutions are also needed in agriculture and forestry and measures in the entire food system. Many of these measures will provide benefits in other areas, such as food and energy security.""

The IPCC report claims that Western countries could aid in reducing the impact on 'climate change' upon ""500 million people [who] live in desert-prone areas"" by reducing meat intake.

""Given that Germany is now considering increased VAT on meat, it makes me think that a meat tax will again be raised on the Swedish agenda,"" said SVT commentator Erika Bjerström.

29,"One month ago, I wrote The Common Roots Of Climate Change And COVID-19 Hysteria that demonstrated the disingenuous fear-mongering tactics of global warming alarmists as they used COVID-19 to purposely spark the largest global economic event in history.Climate alarmists have long wanted to kill the “brown economy” and replace it with a “green” form of Sustainable Development, aka Technocracy. Less than 30 days after the Imperial College released their initial data model that predicted 500,000 deaths in the UK and 1.2 million in the U.S., their whole narrative is now falling apart, but the damage has already been done and cannot be reversed.

The World Health Organization is a full-fledged agency of the United Nations, which drives the above mentioned climate alarmists. The WHO’s estimated mortality rate is 20-30 times higher than the actual death rate being reported by Stanford University of between 0.1 and 0.2 percent.

The number of actual deaths from COVID-19 would not likely be changed if no stampede was ever triggered in the first place. Perhaps it would only have been a nastier-than-usual flue season. However, the Great Panic of 2020 has caused innumerable non coronavirus-related deaths and has torpedoed the global economic system. Millions of people are out of work. Tens of thousands of businesses are already permanently shuttered. People that need health care are scared to death to present themselves to a hospital.

The reality is that the few fear-mongering Technocrats who knew exactly what they were doing when they figuratively yelled “FIRE!” in a crowded theater, will never be held accountable for their despicable and fraudulent manipulation of society.

655,"UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. climate chief says world leaders must recognize there is no option except to speed-up and scale-up action to tackle global warming, warning that continuing on the current path will lead to “a catastrophe.”

Patricia Espinosa stressed in two recent interviews with the Associated Press that climate scientists are saying there’s still a chance to make things right “but the window of opportunity is closing very soon” and the world has 12 years until carbon emissions reach “a point of no return.”

That means the world needs to accelerate all efforts to keep from reaching that level, “and therefore all efforts are absolutely indispensable” to cut carbon emissions and keep temperatures from rising, she said.

Some top scientists say reaching the “tipping point” in 12 years is an oversimplification of a U.N. report last year.

Espinosa said carbon emissions were expected to rise in the immediate future after the landmark Paris agreement was adopted in 2015 to address climate change because the transformations needed to go to a downward trajectory “cannot be done overnight.” In addition, global population is growing and more people demand more energy and resources, she said.

“What has become clear, however, is that if we continue to grow or to behave in a way that this kind of trajectory is maintained we will not be able to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement,” said Espinosa, who is executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The Paris agreement called for global temperatures to rise a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius, so the goal is really about preventing another 1 or 0.5 degrees Celsius (1.8 or 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) increase from now.

A report last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, concluded that while it’s technically possible to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, it is highly unlikely because this would require a dramatic overhaul of the global economy, including a shift away from fossil fuels. Deep in the report, scientists say less than 2% of 529 of their calculated possible future scenarios kept warming below the 1.5 degree C (2.7 degrees F) goal.

“What science is showing now since Paris is that 1.5 degrees C is really necessary because the consequences of staying at 2 degrees C are very big,” Espinosa said. “And secondly, it is also showing that 1.5 degrees C is possible. It takes more effort. It takes much more political will.”

She said the IPCC scientists gave the world 12 years “to speed-up and scale-up the actions” to cut emissions before they start spiraling out of control.

“It doesn’t mean that we need to wait 12 years and then look at it as the moment to do this,” Espinosa said. “It means that we need to accelerate the tipping point, and therefore all efforts are absolutely indispensable.”

The U.N. report does not say 2030, the date used, is a last chance, hard deadline for action, as it has been interpreted in some quarters.

The panel “did not say we have 12 years left to save the world,” James Skea, co-chairman of the report and professor of sustainable energy at Imperial College London, told The Associated Press. “The hotter it gets, the worse it gets, but there is no cliff edge.”

“This has been a persistent source of confusion,” agreed Kristie L. Ebi, director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington in Seattle. “The report never said we only have 12 years left.”

Espinosa said in an interview Tuesday that the attention the issue is getting “is clearly growing” but not “at the speed and the breadth that it should.”

Governments get trapped in dealing with immediate needs “and we are not yet in a situation where we can say we have a broad understanding that the threat to climate change is part of those immediate needs,” Espinosa said.

She said communities that suffer destruction from the effects of climate change have woken up, the movement by children from schools around the world is “a wake-up call,” and mass protests to combat climate change will hopefully spur decision-makers.

But Espinosa said some people say climate change isn’t happening, “this is not man-made,” and “others are just very, very indifferent to the issue.”

“So we have a lot of work to do to still to get everybody on board,” she said. “We have a very long, long way to go.”

Espinosa stressed that the goal is “to get to a moment where leaders recognize that there is no option.”

“The truth is that if we continue to produce, consume, to function as we are doing now, we know that we are going toward a catastrophe,” she said, and that will mean loss of lives, serious impacts on different sectors of the economy, massive displacement and instability.

Leaders must understand “that the business as usual scenario is not an option anymore,” she said.

To those who question how the goal of 1.5 degrees C can be achieved, Espinosa asked: “How can we ignore a goal that is absolutely necessary to avoid really catastrophic consequences?”

U.S. President Donald Trump announced in 2017 that the U.S. will pull out of the Paris climate accord unless he can get a better deal — a possibility that others such as the European Union and China have dismissed.

“We want to engage with the U.S. government and listen to their concerns and see how we can maybe address them together,” Espinosa said. “I’m still hopeful that there could be reconsideration of this decision.”

She noted that many places in the United States are being severely affected by climate change “so I believe this can also bring political leaders in the U.S. to try to exercise their influence in hopefully looking at this issue one more time.”

Even without support from the Trump administration, Espinosa said, there is a lot of U.S. leadership on climate change from the business sector, regions, governors, mayors and ordinary Americans which “we see with great optimism.”",mainstream
839,"Extreme events all over the world were marked by the influence of climate change in 2018: wildfires in California, heat waves in Europe and Asia, and record-low sea ice in the Arctic.

That’s according to an annual special report released yesterday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. The report, now in its eighth year, includes a collection of studies analyzing major events to determine whether climate change played a role—a field of research known as attribution science.

Typically, each report includes a number of events in which climate change had a significant influence—and a few in which it didn’t. But as the years go on, a trend seems to be emerging. More and more studies are finding the fingerprints of global warming on disastrous events.

Since 2011, when the first special bulletin was published, it’s “steadily seen an increase in the percentage of papers that find an influence versus not,” NOAA climate scientist Stephanie Herring, lead editor of the special report, said at a press conference announcing the findings.

Averaged across the past eight years, about 73% of published studies have found a role for climate change in the events they examined, versus about 27% that didn’t. But it isn’t an even split over time. In the last few years, more papers have pointed to the influence of global warming—about 95% of them these days, Herring noted.

In this year’s report, only one paper failed to find a significant tie to climate change. And even then, the results may have been affected by methodological limitations.

That study, an analysis of an extreme rainfall event in Tasmania, Australia, examined a single day’s unusually heavy precipitation. It caused flash flooding and damage across the city of Hobart in a short time. Such remarkable single-day events are rare in the historical record, meaning there are very few events to compare with one another.

The authors suggest that the small sample size may be one reason they were unable to link the event to climate change. In other words, warming may still have played a role in the event—it’s just difficult to say because of the limited record.

On the other hand, researchers found that extreme floods in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. were up to twice as likely under the influence of climate change. Warming in the Four Corners region contributed to drought and substantially reduced seasonal snowpack. Heat waves in Europe were warmer than they would have been without global warming and many times more likely to occur as a result of climate change. Extreme rain in Japan was 7% heavier because of the country’s warming.

And those are just a few.

Some research groups also identified events that are becoming rarer in a warming world.

For instance, February 2018 saw unusually high precipitation in central and southern Mozambique, Zimbabwe and southern Zambia—a region that scientists expect will become drier as the climate continues to change. A study in this year’s special report found that this sort of heavy rainfall event is already up to 37% less likely to occur because of the influence of climate change.

The special bulletin doesn’t include every attribution study conducted each year. Other studies are published in other journals, continually widening the body of literature over time.

But the bulletin’s annual collection does provide a window into how both the science and the climate are changing over time.

There are two reasons the report may be finding more links to climate change as time goes on, experts suggest. One reason is that the influence of global warming is simply growing stronger.

Two years ago, studies in the bulletin found—for the first time ever—that some events would not have been possible without the influence of climate change. The same was true for some studies in last year’s report. For instance, a 2017 marine heat wave off the coast of Australia was found to have been “virtually impossible” in a world without climate change.

Most attribution studies find that a given event was simply made more likely to occur, or perhaps more intense, by the influence of global warming. To some experts, discovering entirely novel events in today’s warming climate is a reminder that the Earth is moving into unprecedented territory.

At the same time, scientists may also be finding more links to climate change because their research is growing more advanced.

Attribution science has been one of the fastest growing fields of climate science since it took off about 15 years ago. In its early days, attribution studies were mainly limited to simple, easy-to-model events, like heat waves.

In recent years, though, scientists have been able to tackle substantially more complex phenomena, like hurricanes and wildfires. And they’re getting better—and faster—at detecting the influence of human activities.

“What we’re seeing now is papers that embrace an incredible range of phenomena,” said Jeff Rosenfeld, editor-in-chief of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. “And that is really a testament to the amount of work that is going into developing this field so rapidly.”

1123,"We often call the result global warming, but it is causing a set of changes to the Earth's climate, or long-term weather patterns, that varies from place to place. While many people think of global warming and climate change as synonyms, scientists use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems—in part because some areas actually get cooler in the short term.

Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts. All of those changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, changing the rhythms of climate that all living things have come to rely on.

What will we do—what can we do—to slow this human-caused warming? How will we cope with the changes we've already set into motion? While we struggle to figure it all out, the fate of the Earth as we know it—coasts, forests, farms, and snow-capped mountains—hangs in the balance.

The ""greenhouse effect"" is the warming that happens when certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat. These gases let in light but keep heat from escaping, like the glass walls of a greenhouse, hence the name.

Sunlight shines onto the Earth's surface, where the energy is absorbed and then radiate back into the atmosphere as heat. In the atmosphere, greenhouse gas molecules trap some of the heat, and the rest escapes into space. The more greenhouse gases concentrate in the atmosphere, the more heat gets locked up in the molecules.

Scientists have known about the greenhouse effect since 1824, when Joseph Fourier calculated that the Earth would be much colder if it had no atmosphere. This natural greenhouse effect is what keeps the Earth's climate livable. Without it, the Earth's surface would be an average of about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius) cooler.

Levels of greenhouse gases have gone up and down over the Earth's history, but they had been fairly constant for the past few thousand years. Global average temperatures had also stayed fairly constant over that time—until the past 150 years. Through the burning of fossil fuels and other activities that have emitted large amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly over the past few decades, humans are now enhancing the greenhouse effect and warming Earth significantly, and in ways that promise many effects, scientists warn.

But climate models that scientists use to monitor Earth’s temperatures take those factors into account. Changes in solar radiation levels as well as minute particles suspended in the atmosphere from volcanic eruptions, for example, have contributed only about two percent to the recent warming effect. The balance comes from greenhouse gases and other human-caused factors, such as land use change.

The short timescale of this recent warming is singular as well. Volcanic eruptions, for example, emit particles that temporarily cool the Earth's surface. But their effect lasts just a few years. Events like El Niño also work on fairly short and predictable cycles. On the other hand, the types of global temperature fluctuations that have contributed to ice ages occur on a cycle of hundreds of thousands of years.

For thousands of years now, emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere have been balanced out by greenhouse gases that are naturally absorbed. As a result, greenhouse gas concentrations and temperatures have been fairly stable, which has allowed human civilization to flourish within a consistent climate.

Now, humans have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution. Changes that have historically taken thousands of years are now happening over the course of decades.

Why does this matter?

Historically, Earth's climate has regularly shifted between temperatures like those we see today and temperatures cold enough to cover much of North America and Europe with ice. The difference between average global temperatures today and during those ice ages is only about 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius), and the swings have tended to happen slowly, over hundreds of thousands of years.

But with concentrations of greenhouse gases rising, Earth's remaining ice sheets such as Greenland and Antarctica are starting to melt too. That extra water could raise sea levels significantly, and quickly. By 2050, sea levels are predicted to rise between one and 2.3 feet as glaciers melt.

As the mercury rises, the climate can change in unexpected ways. In addition to sea levels rising, weather can become more extreme. This means more intense major storms, more rain followed by longer and drier droughts—a challenge for growing crops—changes in the ranges in which plants and animals can live, and loss of water supplies that have historically come from glaciers.",mainstream

278,"Mainstream Scientist Exposes the Dangerous Reality of Chemtrails and Geoengineering

Over the past few years, the issue of geoengineering has been popularized. Mainstream media, academia, and government almost unanimously support the idea of geoengineering as a perceived solution to climate change while suppressing the evidence that it has actually been in use for some time without our consent. On the other hand, there is a growing number of people who are slowly beginning to understand the reality surrounding chemtrail geoengineering, and opposition is slowly growing.

In a bold move against the establishment, Kate Marvel, a mainstream scientist who specializes in “climate change,” spoke out at a Ted Talk against the onset of climate engineering with chemtrails, also known as Solar Radiation Management or “SRM.”

Firstly, computer theorist and founding partner of tech company Applied Invention, Danny Hillis, came on stage and proposed a number of geoengineering concepts which could theoretically, “turn down the temperature of the earth.” These included sending giant parasols into space, putting fizzy water into the ocean, and sending chalk into the atmosphere at a rate of 10 teragrams per year to reflect sunlight and in theory slow the effects of climate change.

Now enters Kate Marvel with the opening line, “Danny, you seem so nice, and I hope we can be friends, and you terrify me.”

Marvel also noted that atmospheric spraying would not do anything to effect other environmental problems such as ocean acidification.

GeoEngineering refers to technologies which are used with the intention of interfering with the earth’s atmosphere in order to alter temperatures and climate. Most of these technologies are still in theoretical stages, however a growing body of evidence suggests that some weather modification technologies such as aerosol spraying or “cloud seeding” have been in production for many decades. Almost no studies have been done which assess the effect that cloud seeding has on environmental safety or human health, which shows that the government has been using untested technologies on the population without our consent.

In 2016, CIA Director John O. Brennan spoke at a Council on Foreign Relations conference about the benefits of geoengineering. However, any mention of potential negative impacts as a result of cloud seeding was conveniently left out.

Although we are all hearing from establishment figures like Brennan that climate engineering is a new technology which we all have the option to accept or decline before it is implemented, that is simply not the case. Evidence going as far back as the early 1920’s shows a push to develop the technology needed to control the weather and has been implemented in some form since at least the 1970’s. This information has been uncovered in various forms, one of those being patents which range from April 27th of 1920 to May of 2003 showing interest in the development of various forms of weather modification technologies. Documents have also been uncovered which show government involvement in SRM since 1947.

Climate Change Alarmism Opens The Door To Reactionary Solutions Such As SRM

The geoengineering debate can be summed up in three words: “Problem, Reaction, Solution.” First, the dire problem of Climate Change is presented by figures like Al Gore, then a reaction is generated from the public in the form of “Climate Can’t Wait!” slogans and public unrest, then the solution of GeoEngineering is presented which gives more power to the powerful and hurts the people in the form of environmental degradation and potential health implications which the document from earlier lists as:

“1. Cloud seeding has been responsible for the great 5-year drought in the Northeast United States.

 2. Isolated sections in the Northeast have experienced 18 years of drought due to cloud seeding.

 3. Weather disturbances in the South Atlantic [sic] have been eliminated and has reduced [sic] the east coast’s rainfall by 30 percent – rain that is needed if agriculture is to be successful.

 4. The average dairy farmer on the east coast, living in an area of cloud seeding, has averaged a net financial loss because of cloud seeding.

 5. Crop production losses in Franklin County, Pa., alone have amounted to $50 Million.

 6. When effects of seeding wear off, cloudbursts occur, causing floods, destroying crops, buildings, and drowning people as well as livestock.

 7. Seeding has been responsible for the serious air pollution problems.

 8. Mental retardation and insanity are traceable to cloud seeding chemicals.

 9. Poisoning of all living matter is directly related to cloud seeding.

 10. Emphysema is three times higher in areas of heavy cloud seeding.

 11. Cancer is virulently out of proportion.

 12. Financial losses to agriculture and related industries run into the billions.

 13. Forest trees as well as cultivated orchards are dying from chemical reactions taking place in the air due to the addition of cloud seeding agents.”



We often hear predictions surrounding climate change by so-called “experts” like Al Gore who claimed that the Arctic would become “ice-free” by 2013. Ironically, in 2016 a global warming expedition to the Arctic was forced to turn around due to record ice.

There are real solutions to environmental problems which don’t end up harming us or the environment further. It is time for people to stand up for themselves and reject dangerous and untested technologies like these.

992,"One reason climate activists have stopped emphasizing individual behavior is that it’s extraordinarily difficult to persuade people to change, even under threat. Global warming has seemed less imminent than the viral threat, even in this new era of hellacious megadroughts, superstorms and wildfires, and the changes that individuals do make can seem pathetically inadequate to the task of transforming a fossil-fueled economy. The solar panels on my roof have prevented just 81 tons of carbon emissions in nearly three years, a period when U.S. emissions amounted to nearly 20 billion tons. My all-electric Chevrolet Bolt saved about 500 gallons of gasoline last year, while U.S. drivers burned 142 billion gallons.

So it’s understandable that climate activists have grown weary of the ubiquitous Fifty Ways to Save the Earth narratives suggesting that citizens can fix the climate by carpooling, reusing their grocery bags or unplugging their computers at night. It’s hard to blame them for getting irritated when a global petroleum company offers a toolkit for children to track their school’s carbon footprint. And it makes sense for them to focus on policies that could help slash emissions on a broader scale, like carbon taxes or clean-energy subsidies or pollution limits, and on the big targets that make ambitious climate goals unattainable, like fossil-fuel infrastructure, logging roads and political assaults on the environment.

But the new climate mantra is not just that individual behavior is less important than institutional change. It’s that individual behavior is basically irrelevant, and that harping on it makes institutional change less likely, alienating potential allies with victim-blaming and virtue-signaling, bamboozling the public into taking responsibility for problems caused by corporations and politicians instead of clamoring for corporate and political accountability. “It shifts the blame from the actual causes of climate change to fake ones … and shifts attention from meaningful actions to meaningless psychological ones,” wrote the Daily Beast’s Jay Michaelson.

Climate change is a wicked collective action problem, and no one seriously believes that 7.7 billion people can overcome the tragedy of the global commons by switching to reusable cups and biking to work. But while individual change alone can't fix the climate, the climate can't be fixed without it: When the scientists from the research coalition Project Drawdown ranked the top solutions for reducing global emissions, No. 3 and No. 4 were reducing food waste and embracing plant-rich diets, solutions that depend on people’s everyday life decisions.

Activists often cite a study arguing that just 100 companies are responsible for 71 percent of global emissions, but ExxonMobil isn’t forcing us to drive gas-guzzling SUV’s to the mall. Nobody would drill for oil or raise methane-burping cattle if individuals didn’t buy gasoline and beef. And while government policies can promote climate-friendly consumer choices like electric vehicles and plant-based meat alternatives, consumers still have to choose them for the policies to work.

The haze that is currently lifting around so much of the world—the Himalayas are suddenly visible from India—is literally opening new horizons, reshaping notions of what’s possible, showing that at least in an emergency, individuals can make sacrifices for a collective benefit. On Earth Day, activists will rally the people of the world to vote and lobby and protest and boycott for climate action, making the case that carbon emissions are an emergency, too.

It’s an odd organizing strategy to try to assure those people at the same time that their own emissions don’t matter. But it’s a tension in the movement as old as Earth Day itself.

On the second Earth Day in 1971, a group called Keep America Beautiful first aired the indelible “Crying Indian” ad, featuring a lone canoeist in Native American garb paddling from a pristine stream into a filthy bay. As he disembarked on a litter-strewn beach, a garbage bag chucked out of a passing car ruptured at his feet, and a tear trickled down his cheek.

Today, environmentalists often condemn that ad as a manipulative sham designed to shift responsibility for litter from corporations to individuals. The Crying Indian was actually an Italian-American actor with a feather in his hair. Keep America Beautiful was actually a front group for companies that wanted to avoid government regulation of wasteful packaging. In their USA Today op-ed about how going vegan can’t save the world, the eminent climatologist Michael Mann and co-author Jonathan Brockopp dismissed the 21st-century focus on individual climate responsibility as a modern Crying Indian campaign, tailored to avoid necessary government regulation of corporate carbon pollution: “This obsession with personal action, though promoted by many with the best of intentions, plays into the hands of the polluting interests by distracting us from the systemic changes that are needed.” For society, they wrote, the approach “could prove suicidal.”

Then again, the iconic “We Have Met the Enemy” poster also featured Pogo picking up litter, so it wasn’t just corporate astroturf groups pushing that approach. And in the early years of the Earth Day era, the U.S. government took unprecedented action to protect the planet, passing the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act and other landmark laws. So the Crying Indian campaign didn’t turn out to be distracting or suicidal in that respect.

It also helped make littering extremely uncool. America still has serious problems with wasteful packaging, but Americans don’t chuck much garbage out their car windows anymore. Our roadsides and beaches are much tidier now. The Keep America Beautiful message that it’s irresponsible to dump trash on the world around us, as manipulative as it was, ultimately resonated with the public because it was clearly true. Littering isn’t the worst thing humanity does to nature, but we shouldn’t do it. And now that it’s stigmatized in the United States, most of us don’t.

Carbon emissions are atmospheric litter. Every gram of carbon makes global warming a bit worse. But carbon litter is invisible, while normal litter is ugly, which helps explain why carbon litter, though much harder to remove than normal litter, is not yet uncool.

Carbon litter is also everywhere, which makes it harder to fight and makes the emissions each of us create when we charge our iPhones, drive our Dakotas and stuff our faces with Big Macs feel like insignificant drops in a planetary bucket. There are a billion cattle on earth, and your Meatless Mondays wouldn’t make a noticeable dent in their emissions if you lived to be a million years old.

Still, those tiny individual drops can eventually fill the bucket, while shrinking the drops can buy humanity time before the bucket overflows. In fact, U.S. per capita beef consumption has declined by one-third since the 1970s, as chicken has become America’s meat of choice; one group calculated that the emissions reduction from that consumer shift over just one decade was like taking 39 million cars off the road. The average American still eats three burgers a week, but if we all replaced one of them with a plant-based Beyond Burger, we’d save a land area the size of Massachusetts from deforestation every year. That would definitely make a noticeable dent.",mainstream
828,"We used data from a global field survey15 to identify the ecological drivers and the current and future distributions of potential soil-borne plant pathogens in soils worldwide. Briefly, bulk soils (top 7.5 cm) were collected from 235 ecosystems located in 18 countries from six continents (Supplementary Fig. 1) and covered nine biomes (temperate, tropical and dry forests, cold, temperate, tropical and arid grasslands, shrubland and boreal) between 2003 and 2015. Locations were selected to provide a solid representation for most environmental conditions (for example, climate, soil and vegetation types) found on Earth (Supplementary Appendix 1). For example, MAP and MAT in these locations ranged from 67 to 3,085 mm and from −11.4° to 26.5 °C, respectively. Given the global distribution of croplands, most natural ecosystems are surrounded to a certain level by agricultural fields. Soil samples were sieved on arrival at the laboratory (2 mm mesh). Then, a portion of soil was immediately frozen at −20 °C for molecular analyses, and the rest of the soil was air-dried and stored for a month before physicochemical analyses.

Our field global survey15 included 12 environmental variables, which were obtained either in the field or from satellites and databases. Elevation and climatic variables, which include MAT, MAP and temperature and precipitation seasonality, were collected from the Worldclim database (https://www.worldclim.org; ~1 km resolution)31. Note that air and soil (https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/) temperatures are highly correlated at the global scale (Pearson’s r = 0.81, P = 0.0011) and that we used air temperature because current and future global models for this variable are more robust. Plant cover (2001–2015) was obtained using remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer at a ~1 km resolution32. Soil properties (texture (% of clay + silt), pH and total organic C) were determined from topsoil (top 7.5 cm) samples collected from each location using standardized protocols33. To avoid biases associated with having multiple laboratories analysing soils from different sites, all the samples were analysed at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Spain). Soil pH was measured with a pH meter in a 1:2.5 mass:volume soil and water suspension. Soil texture (% of fine fractions, clay + silt) was determined as detailed in Maestre et al.33. The concentration of soil total organic carbon (C) was determined using a wet chemistry method34.

We used SEM35 to identify the direct and indirect effects of climate, vegetation and soil properties as drivers of the relative abundance potential plant pathogens (see our a priori model in Supplementary Fig. 3). The most common vegetation types in our database (forests and grasslands) were included in our SEM as categorical variables with two levels: 1 (a given ecosystem type) and 0 (remaining ecosystem types). As some of the variables introduced were not normally distributed, the probability that a path coefficient differs from zero was tested using bootstrap tests36. Bootstrapping is preferred to the classical maximum-likelihood estimation in these cases because, in bootstrapping, probability assessments are not based on an assumption that the data match a particular theoretical distribution. Thus, data are randomly sampled with replacement to arrive at estimates of standard errors that are empirically associated with the distribution of the data in the sample. We conducted models for the relative abundance (%) of all soil-borne fungal plant pathogens (unrarefied and rarefied, 4,500 reads per sample; see Molecular analyses below), plant pathogens with single (plant pathogens only) and mixed trophic mode (plant pathogen and endophyte and/or saprotrophic fungi) and plant pathogens classified as probable and highly probable plant pathogens (excluding possible pathogens)6. Moreover, we conducted models for the most abundant pathogen genera (Alternaria, Fusarium, Venturia and Phoma). The environmental data included in our model (Supplementary Table 1) did not suffer from multicollinearity (Pearson’s r < 0.7 in all cases; Supplementary Table 10).

We then tested the goodness of fit of our model. To do so, we used the chi-square test (χ2; the model has a good fit when 0 ≤ χ2 ≤ 2 and 0.05 < P ≤ 1.00) and the RMSEA; the model has a good fit when 0 ≤ RMSEA ≤ 0.05 and 0.10 < P ≤ 1.00 (ref. 36). Finally, we confirmed the fit of the model using the Bollen–Stine bootstrap test (the model has a good fit when 0.10 < bootstrap P ≤ 1.00). Our model showed a solid goodness of fit and, therefore, a satisfactory fit to our data (Fig. 1d). SEM models were conducted with the software AMOS 20 (IBM SPSS Inc.).

We conducted a Spearman correlation analyses to further evaluate the associations between climate, vegetation, soil properties and the relative abundance of the most ubiquitous putative fungal plant pathogens (that is, those genera found in >50% of all the locations surveyed). Spearman rank correlations measure the strength and direction of association between two ranked variables. They do not require normality of data, and linearity is not a strict assumption of these analyses. We used a false discovery rate approach to determine adjusted P values for all the correlations to control for spurious (false positives) correlations. We used the R package ‘fdrtool’37 to conduct these analyses.

We used the sampled dataset to generate global maps of likely distributions of these pathogens. In particular, we conducted ordinary least squares models to project each map for current and future states of soil pathogens across the world. The implementation of these models was preceded by exploratory correlation analyses to identify the most important factors associated with the distributions of potential plant pathogens. These included climate (D and D ), vegetation type (D , forest and D , grassland), elevation (S ) and soil variables (S , soil texture; S , soil carbon; S , soil pH). ‘S’ and ‘D’ indicate the variables that were either kept constant for current and future conditions (S) or those that changed in future scenarios (D). Climatic seasonality data were not included in these analyses given the current levels of projection uncertainty associated with this type of data under contrasting global change scenarios38.

For future projections of the relative abundance of potential plant pathogens, we used precipitation, temperature and land-use datasets from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project39 and the Land-use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP)40 activities from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change. This selection followed the protocol laid out in Kim et al.41.

In terms of climate datasets, we used the bias-corrected historical and future ISMIP2a dataset39,42, which spans the timeframe from 1951 to 2099. We considered three RCPs: RCP2.6 (+0.4 to 1.6 °C by 2050), RCP6.0 (+0.8 to 1.8 °C by 2050) and RCP8.5 (+1.4 to 2.6 °C by 2050). The monthly means of daily temperatures and daily total precipitation greater than 1 mm were calculated for the available period of these data. For the purpose of this study, we selected two projection steps, 2010 and 2050. To avoid outliers, we calculated 20-year climatologies using an analysis window centred in each year step. The dataset created was used as a climate input for all the model runs. For each SSP–RCP combination, we used two different general circulation models (that is, gfdl-esm2m and noresm1-m)42.

For the land-use projections, we built on the dataset provided by the land-use Harmonized v2.0 project (http://luh.umd.edu/)43. This dataset was produced in the context of the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 644,45, and contains a harmonized set of land-use scenarios that are consistent between historical reconstructions and future projections. It reproduces annual land-use reconstructions for historical land-use forcing (which covers the period 850–2015) and for different integrated assessment models and SSPs from 2015 to 2100 at a 0.25° resolution. These pathways represent a range of plausible future scenarios based on different socioeconomic challenges for climate change mitigation (low in SSP1 (sustainability) and SSP4 (regional inequality); high in SSP5 (fossil-fuelled development)), and potential challenges for adaptation (low in SSP1 and SSP5; high in SSP4). A full description of each scenario is given in Popp et al.44. Each SSP corresponds to a specific RCP; here we selected the combinations SSP1–RCP2.6, SSP4–RCP6.0 and SSP5–RCP8.5. For the static datasets, we resampled all the soil data from soil grids39 to 0.25° resolution to match the resolution of the non-static datasets. The same procedure was done with the elevation dataset46.

Using an exploratory analysis, which loops through all the potential variable combinations to maximize the predicted power of each equation, we obtained different equations for each of the analysis:

The equations mentioned above translate to different fit parameters: (1) all potential plant pathogens (P ), R2 = 0.16, P < 0.001; (2) Alternaria (P ), R2 = 0.27, P < 0.001; (3) Fusarium (P ), R2 = 0.18, P < 0.001; (4) Phoma (P ), R2 = 0.37, P < 0.001 and (5) Venturia (P ), R2 = 0.26, P < 0.05. A map of the extrapolation uncertainty for our global database (235 locations) is available in Supplementary Fig. 8 (see also Supplementary Appendix 1). In addition, we further cross-validated our main map using an independent global database, as explained in Supplementary Appendix 2.

We used a nine-year manipulative field experiment to provide further experimental evidence for a causal link between warming and the relative abundance of soil-borne fungal potential plant pathogens. This experiment is being conducted on a dryland ecosystem located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula (40° 01′ 55.7″ N 3° 32′ 48.3″ W; 590 m above sea level). MAT and mean annual rainfall are 15 °C and 349 mm, respectively, and the soil is classified as Gypsiric Leptosol (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006; http://www.fao.org). Perennial plant cover is lower than 40% and is dominated by the perennial grass Stipa tenacissima L. Open areas between plant patches contain a well-developed biocrust community dominated by lichens, such as Diploschistes diacapsis, Squamarina lentigera and Psora decipiens. Biocrust communities have been proposed as a system model to test the effects of global change on ecosystem functioning under global change scenarios47,48,49,50. The experiment, described in De Guevara et al.16, was established in the study area in July 200850, and includes two levels of warming (ambient (control) versus ~2 °C increase (warming))16,50.

To achieve a temperature increase within the forecasts of climate change models for the study area51, we built open-top chambers of hexagonal design with sloping sides of 40 cm × 50 cm × 32 cm in 1.2 × 1.2 m plots (Supplementary Fig. 6). We used methacrylate to build our open-top chambers because this material does not substantially alter the characteristics of the light spectrum. Our warming treatment promoted an average increase of air and surface soil (0–2 cm) temperature of 1.94 and 2.55 °C, respectively. Warming effects were highest during the summer (June–September).

Soil samples (top 0–1 cm depth) were collected nine years after the beginning of the experiment from ten plots per combination of treatments. Three soil samples per plot were sampled with a 5 cm diameter core, and then bulked to obtain a unique sample per plot. Soil was sieved (2 mm mesh) and separated into two fractions. A portion of soil was immediately frozen at −20 °C for molecular analyses. Given the different soil-sampling depths between our experimental and observational studies, caution should potentially be applied when directly comparing the two datasets.

We used non-parametric PERMANOVA (https://www.primer-e.com) to test for important effects of warming on the (ITS amplicon sequencing and qPCR analyses) abundance of fungal plant pathogens (see Molecular analyses). These analyses are robust to the lack of normality in our data. Warming was considered a fixed factor in these analyses (n = 10). Non-metric PERMANOVA analyses were carried out using PRIMER v6113 and PERMANOVA+ (PRIMER-E).

Amplicon sequencing analyses were used to determine the fungal communities in soils from the global survey and warming experiment. The extracted DNA samples were frozen and shipped to the Next Generation Genome Sequencing Facility of the University of Western Sydney (Australia). Fungal communities were determined by sequencing ITS region 2 with primers FITS7 (GTGARTCATCGAATCTTTG) and ITS4 (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC) on an Illumina MiSeq platform (2 × 300 PE). Bioinformatic processing was performed using a combination of USEARCH52 and UNOISE353. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs (phylotypes)) were defined at 100% similarity thresholds using UNOISE353. Phylotype identification was obtained against the UNITE fungal database (V7.2)54. The relative abundance (%) of each phylotype was calculated from the resulting OTU (phylotype) table. Plant pathogenic lifestyles for fungal communities were determined using the FUNGuild database (http://www.stbates.org/guilds/app.php; accessed September 2019)6. A complete list of the potential soil-borne fungal plant pathogens included in this study can be found in Supplementary Data 1. We obtained 12,086,669 (global survey, n = 235) and 787,142 (field experiment, n = 20) ITS reads across the studied samples, being 14.4 and 21.6% of all the retrieved ITS reads classified as putative fungal plant pathogens in the global survey and field experiment, respectively. The relative abundance of all the soil-borne fungal plant pathogens (both exclusively pathogenic or with mixed life styles) was calculated in both cases using unrarefied ITS OTU tables, as the sum of the relative abundance (%) of all the ITS sequences classified as fungal plant pathogens (that is, the sum of all ITS reads classified as pathogens/all ITS reads × 100 at each soil sample). The total relative abundance of the potential plant pathogens was highly correlated with the same variable calculated using a rarefied OTU table for the global field survey (4,500 reads per sample; r = 0.998; P < <0.001) and the field experiment (4,500 reads per sample; r = 0.999; P < <0.001), so the choice of not rarefying our data did not affect our conclusions. All Gibberella reads were considered as Fusarium in this study for consistency with the most recent classifications55.

To further confirm the robustness of the taxonomic assignments, for each phylotype identified as a putative plant pathogen, we performed a BLAST search (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) against the fungal ITS sequences from the type material, and representative fungal genomes available in GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). We then selected the top ten hits for each phylotype, and then re-parsed those matching species with FUNGuild. A total of 1,574 and 586 OTUs matched, at a 97% identity cutoff, with ITS ex-type sequences and representative genomes, respectively (Supplementary Data 1), having pathogenic trophic modes (both exclusively pathogenic and mixed modes). The relative abundance of all the plant pathogens identified using the UNITE fungal database (V7.2)54 was highly correlated to that calculated using GenBank from ITS ex-type (r = 0.96; P < <0.001; 97% cutoff) and representative genomes (r = 0.71; P < <0.001; 97% cut-off) (Supplementary Data 1). These analyses provide further support for our data.

qPCR analyses were done to further confirm the results from our warming experiment. The absolute abundance of Alternaria—the most predominant fungal plant pathogen in our surveys—was estimated by a real-time qPCR using primers Dir1ITSAlt (TGTCTTTTGCGTACTTCTTGTTTCCT) and Inv1ITSAlt (CGACTTGTGCTGCGCTC), which are commonly used to quantify pathogenic plant-associated Alternaria spp.56. Mastermix reactions were prepared in a volume of 10 μl that contained 1.5 ng of DNA template, 5 μl of 2 × SensiFast SYBR Hi-ROX kit (Bioline), 2 μl of water and 1 μl (5 μmol μl–1) of each primer. Amplifications were performed in 96-well reaction plates using a Bio-RAD CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad). Each plate included duplicate reactions per DNA sample, standards and a negative control sample (without DNA). Standard curves were generated using a tenfold serial dilution of PCR amplicons that contained the Alternaria target region. The amplification programme consisted of 1 cycle of 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 25 s and 72 °C for 20 s, and a final elongation step of 72 °C for 2 min. To determine the reaction specificity, a melting curve analysis was subsequently performed by incubating the samples at 95 °C for 2 min and annealing at 65 °C for 5 s, followed by heating them slowly at 0.5 °C s–1 up to 95 °C, while continuously monitoring the fluorescence signal.

1312,"Climate change activists love to insist that carbon dioxide is behind global warming, and they’ve made a sport out of refuting claims to the contrary.

However, it’s getting harder to defend their delusional stance as more than 100 different scientific papers and counting show that carbon dioxide’s effect on the climate is actually quite small.

The papers use terms such as “negligible” to describe the effects of CO2 on the climate.

For example, a paper from last year said there was not “a consistent warming with gradual increase (in CO2) in low to high latitudes in both hemispheres, as it should be from the global warming theory.”

After pointing out the complexity of climate predictions, the researchers said it is simply not possible to support the notion that global warming stems from human-caused greenhouse effect.

Last fall, a group of 500 scientists and other professionals in the climate science space penned a letter to the United Nations sharing their view that there isn’t a climate crisis and that they consider spending so much money on the issue to be “cruel and imprudent.”

In the letter, they encouraged the UN to follow a climate policy that is based on “sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation.”

The fact remains that the so-called global warming science that many adherents love to quote is based on a biased interpretation of questionable science that keeps getting repeated as though it were fact.

MIT Professor Richard Lindzen, an atmospheric sciences emeritus professor behind more than 200 different scientific papers, said that climate alarmists’ voices seem to get louder and louder as the climate changes less.

He also noted that in a 2007 paper, the UN International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) admitted that it’s not possible to predict future climate states.

Lying to get what they want

He believes that those sounding the alarm bell about climate change are using it as a way of getting what they want. Activists are seeking supporters and funding, while politicians are using it to gain power and money.

The media, he says, uses it to grab headlines because “Doomsday scenarios sell.”

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was caught publishing fake data on global warming in a failed attempt to debunk a UN report’s assertion that global warming was slowing down.

Meanwhile, data compiled by NASA showed that carbon dioxide was cooling the atmosphere instead of warming it up as commonly claimed. That’s not surprising when you consider the fact that 95 percent of climate software models have actually turned out to be wrong.

Carbon dioxide has been demonized, but the truth is that it’s what is sustaining life on our planet. If we got rid of it the way many climate change alarmists are pushing for, life on our planet would collapse.

Plants wouldn’t be able to breathe and would essentially suffocate. We’d have no food to eat and it would spell the end of mankind. So why are some people on a mission to get rid of it?",conspiracy
794,"“I feel like a parent whose child just took its first step and hear someone say, ‘That’s a really slow kid,’” said Alex Flint, executive director with the Alliance for Market Solutions, a group trying to persuade Republicans to support taxing carbon emissions.

“I respect those who have been working for years to make incremental progress with Republicans. That is an important step,"" he added. ""It is an inadequate step.""

The emerging GOP framework largely sidesteps confronting the primary driver of climate change: the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily caused by decades of burning oil, gas and coal. The competing “Green New Deal” championed by progressive Democrats aims to take those sources head-on, calling for an aggressive – and expensive – effort to move the U.S. off fossil fuels in the coming decades.

Instead, legislation expected to be unveiled in the coming months by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is expected to lean on Republican standbys: chiefly, planting more trees, curbing plastic waste and boosting innovation and exporting cleaner, U.S.-made technology to help other countries address their share of the global problem. One of the top priorities will be the ""promotion of cleaner, more efficient fossil fuels to meet global demand,"" according to slides presented to a closed-door GOP conference meeting last week.

""We've got to actually do something different than we've done to date,"" McCarthy said in an October interview with the Washington Examiner. ""For a 28-year-old, the environment is the No. 1 and No. 2 issue.""

The GOP framework is nowhere near what some Republicans were willing to support as recently as 2008, when Republican presidential nominee John McCain backed a sweeping cap-and-trade proposal. Eight House Republicans voted for a major cap-and-trade bill the following year; just one — Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey — is still in Congress.

""We're still working our way back up” to credibility on climate change, said Bob Inglis, a former GOP House member from South Carolina who lost his reelection bid in 2010 to a Tea Party-backed primary opponent, despite voting against cap-and-trade. He said the party “can’t claim to have a vision” on climate change because the proposals amount to only “incremental progress.""

""Republicans lost the House in districts like Barbara Comstock’s,"" Inglis added, referring to a Republican who lost her Northern Virginia seat in 2018. “You can't win suburban districts with retro positions on climate.”

Inglis now runs RepublicEn, which advocates for a border-adjustable, revenue-neutral carbon tax.

Trump gave a nod to the new agenda at this week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he agreed to join a global initiative aimed at planting one trillion trees by 2050, an effort designed to reverse the 10 billion trees lost every year to deforestation, in hopes of taming carbon dioxide emissions. But he dismissed more serious warnings about climate change, a top concern at the conference.

“This is not a time for pessimism, it is a time for optimism. Fear and doubt is not a good thought process,” Trump said in a speech Tuesday. ""To embrace the possibilities of today, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers.”

The House GOP policy meeting McCarthy convened last week marked the beginning of an information gathering process for a final product on climate change, though it’s not certain whether that results in one sweeping bill, a package of legislation or merely a framework, two House GOP aides said.

The House Republican aides noted that global fossil fuel consumption is expected to rise for decades, particularly in poorer Asian countries, and that the U.S. should invest in developing cheaper, next-generation technologies — fossil fuel and clean — that could be deployed abroad while ensuring U.S. firms reap the economic benefits.

In the short-term, House Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans have settled on 12 bills they say should make up an immediate package to address climate change. But most of the measures have been introduced and advanced in prior Congresses without mentioning climate change, and several passed with minimal Democratic support. They have not yet reached out to Democrats about the new effort, one aide said.

""The GOP needs to have a Republican position on climate change. I would say it’s our hope that what we table would attract bipartisan support,"" the aide said. ""We haven't had a coherent message in some time.""

Environmentalists say the ideas the Republicans are considering are way too weak to address the global climate crisis.

""All they can come together on is useful, but really tiny stuff like tree planting and energy R&D,” said David Doniger, senior strategic director for the Natural Resources Defense Council’s climate and clean energy program. “Those are just not going to meet the climate crisis, which requires that we cut the pollution that’s driving this.”

Republicans have refused to embrace any specific timeframe for reducing emissions or specify how much to cut them. And senior GOP lawmakers continue to oppose proposals for economy-wide carbon pricing, such as a carbon tax, or so-called dividends that have attracted some support from prominent Republicans and oil companies.

“I’m certainly not patting them on the back,” said Ted Halstead, chairman and CEO of the Climate Leadership Council, a group backed by Republican elder statesmen like former Secretaries of State George Shultz and James Baker and oil giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell. Halstead said the proposals are at least a “stepping stone.”

“That’s been an issue for us — the over-regulation, the over-taxation,” Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), the ranking member of the House E&C Committee, said last week. “It’s something I don’t think we’d find common ground on when there are so many other opportunities to come together.”

Hanna Bogorowski, a spokesperson for McCarthy, said: “House Republicans will continue to build and roll out proposals through the spring.”

The White House declined to comment on the Republican package, but there’s little daylight between House Republicans and Trump on actions to upend some of the nation’s most aggressive emissions-fighting rules. Most have cheered Trump’s regulation-slashing swagger, including an expected softening of vehicle fuel efficiency rules.

While Republicans are calling for beefed up energy efficiency, the Department of Energy has dragged its feet on updating existing efficiency standards as required by law, and last week it implemented a new policy that will make it more difficult to create future efficiency rules. And while an expansion of credits for carbon capture technology passed under the last Congress passed easily, the IRS has yet to issue critical guidance industry needs to access that tax credit, stalling new projects.

The administration also has shown little interest in congressional efforts to drive what Republicans call the ""innovation agenda."" Trump has proposed slashing the budgets of DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office — the prime funder of new and applied science for renewable energy — in each of its budgets, including a proposed 70 percent reduction last year. Congress has typically increased the funding in final appropriations.

Republicans contend some Trump moves will aid combating climate change. A proposal earlier this month imposing deadlines for environmental reviews, for example, could ease construction for renewable energy and transmission lines to carry clean power. The American Wind Energy Association welcomed the proposal to update the National Environmental Policy Act regulations, pointing to ""unnecessary costs and long project delays"" under the current approach.

Many Democrats say it is not enough for Republicans to stop denying the scientific consensus on climate change.

“They’re evolving too slowly and a lot of it is fake,” Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) told POLITICO. “Inevitably, [their solution] comes down to new ways to extract more fossil fuel and sell fracked gas. When they do these things, they’re actually talking about making the climate problem worse, not better. We just have to be real about that because we don't have time for fake solutions.”",mainstream

CBS News will be devoting this week to covering climate change from all angles across all our platforms — broadcast and digital — leading up to the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23. ""Face the Nation"" kicked off a special Eye On Earth series Sunday.

Here are five things to know about climate change — and its impact on the world already:

More and more countries around the world are experiencing record high temperatures, droughts, unprecedented floods and other extreme weather events.

According to NASA, the average global temperature has increased by .8 degrees Celsius with 18 of the 19 warmest years occurring since 2001.

The U.N. has warned if the average global temperature increases by 2 degrees Celsius there could be massive sea level rise and almost all the world's coral reefs could die.

Increasing temperatures are already affecting agricultural productivity, putting fruit and vegetable supplies at risk. Unpredictable precipitation patterns and more frequent extreme weather events are adding to disruptions in the food system. Farmers in the U.S. have already felt the harsh outcomes of droughts and unprecedented flooding.

Countries around the world are starting to experience stress on their water supply. The World Resources Institute found that 17 countries are currently under extremely high water stress, which is when the demand for water exceeds the available amount or poor quality restricts its use. Twelve out of those 17 countries are in the Middle East and North Africa.

Population growth, socioeconomic development and urbanization are increasing water demands, while climate change is causing unpredictable precipitation levels and demand.

Last year, Cape Town, South Africa, narrowly avoided a ""day zero"" when the city's water supply was expected to run out.

A government report released November 2019 warned that a warmer planet could mean a big hit to G.D.P. in the coming decades.

The report, issued by 13 federal agencies, predicts that if significant steps are not taken to rein in global warming, the damage will knock as much as 10 percent off the size of the American economy by century's end.

5. What are world leaders doing about it?

In 2016, 174 countries and the European Union signed onto the U.N. Paris Agreement, which aims to prevent global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius through ""nationally determined contributions.""

But the U.N. notes the agreement itself is meaningless without ambitious action from each nation.

President Trump left the agreement in 2017, laying the groundwork for the Trump administration's environmental deregulation policies.

731,"He’s the richest man in the world, and now Jeff Bezos has pledged $10 billion (£7.7 billion) of his personal money to fight climate change.

The Amazon CEO will commit $10 billion to fund scientists, activists, nonprofits and other groups fighting to protect the environment and counter the effects of climate change, he revealed on Instagram .

Writing on the social media app, he said: “Today, I’m thrilled to announce I am launching the Bezos Earth Fund.

“Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share.

“This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world.

“We can save Earth. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organisations, and individuals.

“I’m committing $10 billion to start and will begin issuing grants this summer. Earth is the one thing we all have in common — let’s protect it, together.”

Mr Bezos is currently the richest man in the world, with an estimated net worth of a whopping $129.9 billion (£100.17 billion).

But he isn’t the only billionaire to pledge to use his money to fight climate change.

In recent years, US billionaires including Microsoft's Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer have also committed to funding climate change science.

Amazon has faced protests by environmental activists and pressure from its employees to take action on climate change.

Amazon workers were among hundreds of employees of big technology companies to join climate change marches in San Francisco and Seattle late last year, saying their employers had been too slow to tackle global warming and needed to take more drastic action.

Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, an activist workers group, welcomed the Bezos Earth Fund announcement, but said it did not make up for the company's consumption of fossil fuels and other activities that contribute to climate change.

""We applaud Jeff Bezos' philanthropy, but one hand cannot give what the other is taking away,"" the group said on Twitter .",mainstream
793,"(CNN) The voter passionately motivated by climate change was once something of an anomaly. But that is changing as President Donald Trump has systematically unraveled the nation's environmental regulations at the same time that Americans have witnessed a series of climate-related crises: fires in the Amazon, hurricanes that churn with increasing fury and record-shattering temperatures and weather events across the US.

For the first time in any presidential cycle, Democrats had a mainstream candidate -- in Washington Gov. Jay Inslee -- who ran a campaign centered on climate change. Since Inslee dropped out last month, his former rivals have vowed to pick up his mantle -- with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren literally adopting Inslee's climate change plan as her own as she and nine other candidates prepared for CNN's town hall solely focused on the climate crisis

Climate change got little attention in the 2016 presidential campaign. But there was a notable shift during the 2018 midterm election, said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters. Candidates alarmed by Republican inaction were drawn into congressional races across the country.

""In 2018, we saw a big shift in terms of candidates running on climate change as never before, and that has only increased as we're seeing in the presidential,"" Sittenfeld said. ""I think -- if not every candidate, pretty close to every single candidate -- who is going to be on (CNN's town hall) stage has put out an ambitious, comprehensive plan to combat the climate crisis. So we've definitely seen that this issue is finally starting to get the attention that it deserves.""

The growing alarm is most pronounced among younger voters. John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics poll, noted that climate change ""is now viewed as a top area of concern within both a domestic and foreign policy framework"" for those within the 18-29 year-old age group, though it generally still ranks behind health care, the economy and immigration.

In the Institute's spring poll, protecting the environment ranked third (33%) among foreign policy priorities, behind protecting human rights and preventing the rise of terrorist groups.

Jon Krosnick, a political science and communications professor at Stanford University who directs the Political Psychology Research Group, notes that while no single issue dominates the psyche of American voters, his research shows that climate change is becoming a bigger motivator for a larger group of people.

""One out of five Americans -- that very big,"" Krosnick said. ""It was a consequential issue when it was 17% and 15% and 11%, but it's now a bigger issue.""

Trump's systematic elimination of environmental regulations -- changes he has framed as an effort to improve government efficiency, cut red tape and boost the economy -- brought more attention to those issues and angered Democrats.

Shortly after taking office, Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, a move he said was meant to help American industry and demand fair treatment for America's taxpayers. He has weakened fuel economy targets set by the Obama administration, and revoked the Waters of the US Rule which changed the definition of what wetlands and rivers would be protected by federal regulations. His administration has also sought to reduce the size of national monuments -- including Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah -- and open more public lands to logging, mining and drilling.

""Every week, there's more progress being made advancing the Republican policy agenda. That's the key point here, is that there's so much evidence of (Trump) dismantling environmental protections in so many ways -- including emissions and support for the fossil fuel industry,"" said Krosnick. ""Here we have this, this really productive President who is being very successful at getting his regulation-dismantling through.""

Those actions are ""going to be very motivating"" for the voters who care deeply about climate change, he said.

""We've got a President who is basically goosing them into action,"" Krosnick said. ""So my guess is that they will be a considerable and important force in the election. Turnout will be high in this group, because they will see the difference (between the Republican and Democratic nominees) unless the Democratic nominee chooses to not talk about the environment, or chooses to talk about the environment rarely and disingenuously.""

The growing alarm about climate change has showed up in poll after poll. A Quinnipiac University poll in late August found that 56% of registered voters nationwide believe climate change is an emergency, and those numbers were much higher among Democrats (84%) and independents (63%). By contrast, 81% of Republicans said they did not believe climate change is an emergency.

In a new high since Quinnipiac began asking the question in 2015, 67% of voters said the US is not doing enough to address climate change.

Historically, younger voters have been more concerned about climate change than older age groups -- and while concern is growing among older Americans, that gap still remains.

There is still a strong partisan divide on the issue, which has lined up with Trump's continual tweeting about the issue and his assertion that the press is dramatizing the issue. Gallup found that 12% of Republicans said they were ""a great deal"" concerned about global warming, compared with more than two-thirds of Democrats (69%).

The growing call for government to do more about climate change has encouraged environmental advocates like Sittenfeld, who noted that it is forcing candidates to make the issue a center plank in their policy agendas as they seek to connect with Democrats and independents.

""Even though Trump continues to deny climate change, and so does (Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell, and they're both standing in the way of progress and rolling it back wherever they can, these polls demonstrate that how out of touch they are with voters, including with Republican voters,"" Sittenfeld said. ""By continuing to pander to polluters they are putting the rest of the elected officials in their party in jeopardy.""",mainstream
1343,"Australia's bushfires have brought the devastating consequences of a warming world into sharp relief. And with modelling pointing to temperature increases of between three and four degrees Celcius by 2100 in a business-as-usual scenario, predictions suggest such extreme events are set to become more frequent.

What if we could reverse the warming that is fueling drought and causing flooding around the world?

That is exactly what organizations like the US-based non-profit Foundation for Climate Restoration (F4CR), are proposing. The group wants to restore carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to under 300 parts per million, as was the case in the pre-fossil fuel age. Today, the global average measures more than 400 parts per million.

""I'm very interested in leaving [behind] a world where our children can survive,"" Pieter Fiekowsky, an MIT-trained physicist who founded F4CR in 2015, told DW. To him, ""that clearly requires getting CO2 back to safe levels.”

According to the foundation, achieving that involves ""climate restoration,"" that is, making sure we're collectively removing more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere than we produce. The foundation believes around a trillion tons of carbon dioxide needs to be extracted.

That would require large-scale implementation of nature-based or artificial technologies to suck vast quantities of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere to cool the planet — strategies that fall under the loose definition of ""geoengineering."" However, which technologies are best suited, and whether to implement them at all, is hotly debated among scientists.

Rob Jackson, an earth systems scientist at Stanford University, believes that restoring the climate to what it once was is a better goal than merely stabilizing Earth's temperatures.

""We need a new story, a new narrative around climate change,"" says Jackson, who argues this should involve ambitions that go beyond merely limiting the damage of climate change. ""[Climate restoration] will bring climate benefits. It will save lives by reducing air pollution. It will provide a host of other benefits.""

One solution proposed by F4CR in a last year entails restoring marine habitats that store carbon, such as underwater kelp forests. Another is a form of concrete that binds carbon as it's made, which was used recently to build a new terminal at San Francisco airport.

There are sectors where certain emissions are hard to remove entirely, such as methane — a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide — in the agricultural sector, says Jackson. He recently proposed a technology to remove methane from the air by oxidizing it to carbon dioxide, which although stays around longer has less heat-trapping capacity.

Climate scientists have included some geoengineering solutions, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) — the process of extracting carbon from crops and storing it underground — in the majority of pathways modelled in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.

""It is actually not possible to limit global warming to 2 or 1.5 degrees Celsius, without [removal of greenhouse gases],"" Avit Bhowmik, an assistant professor of risk and environmental studies at Sweden's Karlstad University, told DW. ""Just stopping the increase of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses wouldn't be enough — we have to sequester them.""

Still, Jackson notes some geoengineering proposals, such as releasing large quantities of iron into the ocean to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton—providing food for fish and thereby rebuilding carbon-sequestering fisheries — are still at the experimental stage.

More research is needed both into scaling up such ideas and into the ecological impacts, says Jackson.

Even technologies like BECCS are still in testing. Many experts believe they also distract from the urgency of ceasing greenhouse gas emissions.

""I think these long-term goals [of climate restoration] take away focus from the really important challenge that we have today of bending the emissions curve downward,"" says Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.

There is also concern that geoengineering technologies could create a false sense of security that increased emissions could be removed. Rogelj says ecosystems unable to adapt to current warming are not likely to return even if temperatures decrease.

""Climate restoration doesn't mean that the Earth will look the same [as it did before the pre-industrial era],"" Rogelj adds.

Bhowmik believes it should be possible to achieve a net decline in greenhouse gases without resorting to the most radical geoengineering approaches. The Exponential Roadmap report published in 2019, in which Bhowmik led the modelling work, lays out a strategy focused heavily on nature-based solutions.

To follow that roadmap, the world would need to halve global greenhouse gas emissions every decade from 2020 onwards, improve agricultural practices so farmland absorbs rather than emits carbon, restore large areas of forest and protect carbon-storing ecosystems like peatlands.

""If you follow that route, it would actually be possible by the end of this century to have a substantial reduction in the atmosphere greenhouse gas concentrations. And soon thereafter we will reach the level that was in the preindustrial period,"" Bhowmik believes.

Climate restoration got a boost in September 2019 when F4CR joined scientists, venture capitalists and youth activists at a UN Forum aiming to spur investment for a range of nascent technologies to reverse global warming.

Even though there's disagreement on what — if any — form climate restoration should take, most scientists do agree that it shouldn't be a replacement for mitigating climate change or helping communities around the world cope with the impacts of rising tempertures.

That includes F4CR. ""Climate restoration is a critical third pillar,” says Rick Parnell, CEO of the organization. “[It’s] a third leg of the stool, along with mitigation and adaptation.""

312,"Even though westerners aren’t having children already.

Over 11,000 scientists have signed an emergency declaration urging westerners to have fewer children in order to stop climate change.

Erm, one problem with that – westerners aren’t having children.

Even if you believe in man-made climate change, the biggest surge in population growth is occurring in Africa and the Middle East, and amongst migrants from those countries who now live in the west.

The scientists write that the global population “must be stabilized—and, ideally, gradually reduced—within a framework that ensures social integrity.”

Given that this report was published in a western science journal and amplified by western media outlets, we can only assume it is aimed at westerners.

Which is a little odd, given that in Europe women are having on average just 1.6 children and in North America 1.9 children, both below the replacement rate.

Meanwhile, in Africa women are having on average 4.5 children and in the Middle East 2.8 children. Many of these families are also producing similar numbers of offspring after they move to western countries.

Are scientists going to tell black and brown people that there should be a lot less of them on the planet?

In addition, the entire overpopulation argument is alarmist hysteria. It was first introduced by environmentalist Paul Ehrlich in his 1968 book The Population Bomb, which ludicrously claimed “hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death” by the 1980’s because of overpopulation.

Didn’t happen, but climate alarmists are recycling the same debunked garbage in order to impose population control.

While the people telling us are either financially dependent on enviro-hysteria or travel the world in private jet luxury & vacation on 400 foot yachts.

671,"AN ENORMOUS ice sheet is at risk of melting even if temperatures rise by just 2°C, potentially sparking major climate chaos.

Scientists say that if the East Antarctic Ice Sheet –which is 60 times the size of England – melts, sea levels could rise by four metres, putting areas of the UK at risk of disappearing entirely.

Experts are now warning that more needs to be done to prevent continued global warming.

Melting ice can have a devastating effect on the world, causing the planet to heat up more quickly, changing ocean circulation systems that regulate global weather, and increasing the risk of flooding and tsunamis damage.

A study into historical ice loss suggests even ""moderate warming"" of Earth could melt the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

""With current global temperatures already one degree higher than during pre-industrial times, future ice loss seems inevitable if we fail to reduce carbon emissions,"" said Dr David Wilson, of Imperial College London, who worked on the research.

Scientists have poured lots of effort into investigating the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which mostly sits on land below sea level.

Due to its low-lying position, it contributes to most of the continent's ice melt today.

But experts at Imperial College London and the University of Queensland have now investigated risks facing the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

The EAIS is the largest ice sheet on Earth, and poses a major hazard if it disappears.

Now a study in Nature suggests that 2°C of warming over ""a couple of millennia"" could cause significant melting of the EAIS.

""Antarctica is around twice the size of Australia, with ice sheets several kilometres thick and containing around half of the world's fresh water,"" said Dr Kevin Welsh, at the University of Queensland, a co-author on the study.

""The East Antarctic Ice Sheet covers about two thirds of the area, and because its base is largely above sea level it was generally thought to be less sensitive to warming climates than the adjacent West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

""However, some areas – like the Wilkes Land Subglacial Basin, directly south of Australia – are below sea level and contain enough ice to raise global sea levels by several metres.

""The evidence we have suggests that with the predicted 2°C warming in Antarctica – if sustained over a couple of millennia – the sheet would start melting in these locations.""

Glaciers, which are created by ice sheets, grind up rocks on land.

These rocks are then transported into the nearby Southern Ocean as sediment. This creates a record of earlier erosion by the ice sheet.

Researchers chemically analysed layers of sediment from the ocean floor, which would have originated from the Wilkes Subglacial Basin – collected as part of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program.

The study looked at sediment layers that had settled on the seafloor during the four warm intervals occurring between ice ages over the last 450,000 years.

""Studying ice sheet behaviour in the geological past can inform us about future changes,"" said Dr Wilson.

""By building a picture of how the ice sheet has grown and shrunk as temperatures have fluctuated, we can understand the response of the EAIS to future warming.""

The team found chemical ""fingerprints"" in the sediment which revealed the patterns of erosion as the ice sheet advanced and retreated.

It turned out that the ice sheet had retreated from its current size during some of these warmer ""interglacial"" periods, between 125,000 and 400,000 years ago.

Importantly, at the time, temperatures were as little as two degrees warmer than pre-industrial times – and one degree warmer than today.

During these warmer periods, global sea levels were between six and 13 metres higher than they are today.

According to researchers, if all the ice in the Wilkes Subglacial Basin melted in modern times, global sea levels would rise by up to four metres.

""We found that the most extreme changes in the ice sheet occurred during two interglacial periods 125,000 and 400,000 years ago, when global sea levels were several metres higher than they are today,"" Dr Walsh explained.

""These periods could be analogues for future climates and it seems likely that ice loss from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet contributed to those higher sea levels.

""Ice loss contributes to rising global sea levels which are a threat to many coastal communities, and making projections requires a solid understanding of how sensitive these ice sheets are.""

One of the biggest concerns about rising sea levels is the risk than smaller, more common tsunamis could have a more damaging effect than they do today.

Last month, scientists issued a warning about the risk of “devastating tsunamis” caused by climate change.

Research in Science Advances suggested that rising sea levels – caused by global warming – significantly increase the threat of giant killer waves.

Experts modelled the impact of tsunamis based on sea level increases, and discovered worrying results.

It found that rising sea levels allowed tsunamis to reach much further inland, significantly increasing the risk of floods.

This means small tsunamis that might not be deadly today could wreak havoc in the future.

“Our research shows that sea-level rise can significantly increase the tsunami hazard, which means that smaller tsunamis in the future can have the same adverse impacts as big tsunamis would today,” said Robert Weiss, a professor of geosciences at Virginia Tech.

And if you think Britain is safe from tsunamis, think again.

Earlier this week, research revealed that deadly tsunamis crashing into the UK is more common than previously thought.

Scientists believe three killer waves have hit the UK within the last 10,000 years – raising the possibility that another one may be due.

We already knew about one of these: around 8,200 years ago, the Storegga submarine landslide off the coast of Norway sparked a 20-metre high tsunami that swept across Shetland.

1263,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison sued ExxonMobil, Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday, alleging they deceived and defrauded Minnesotans about climate change.

The lawsuit, filed in Ramsey County District Court, accuses the oil companies and trade group of consumer fraud and deceptive trade practices. It seeks unspecified restitution, a corrective public education campaign and an injunction against continued violations.

“We’re here suing these defendants — API, ExxonMobil and Koch — for hiding the truth, confusing the facts and muddling the water to devastating effect,” Ellison said at a news conference.

At least 15 other units of government have brought similar lawsuits, including Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island. New York lost its lawsuit against ExxonMobil in December.

Ellison wouldn’t specify a dollar figure for the damages he’ll seek but said, “it’s going to be a lot.” He said it could be akin to Minnesota’s $7 billion 1998 settlement with the tobacco industry.

Leaders of several environmental groups participated in the attorney general’s news conference, including Sam Grant, executive director of the climate change group MN350. “We want Exxon, Koch, and API to pay for their lies. Their acts of fraud harmed all Minnesotans. We deserve our day in court, and we stand with future generations.”

ExxonMobil denounced the lawsuit as baseless and without merit.

“This lawsuit is part of a coordinated, politically motivated campaign against energy companies,” spokesman Casey Norton said in an email. “Legal proceedings like this waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money and do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change.”

The chief legal officer for the American Petroleum Institute, Paul Afonso, said in a statement: “The record of the past two decades demonstrates that the industry has achieved its goal of providing affordable, reliable American energy to U.S. consumers while substantially reducing emissions and our environmental footprint. Any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Flint Hills Resources, a subsidiary of Koch Industries that operates a refinery in Pine Bend, Minnesota, said it was reviewing the lawsuit.",mainstream
885,"Meeting in Brussels for a two-day gathering, EU heads of state and government will seek to hammer out a united energy strategy aimed at diversifying sources while reducing pollution.

In the run-up to the meeting, EU leaders have cranked up the rhetoric about the need for tough action to tackle global warming, although some environmentalists say that proposed targets do not go far enough.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who will host European leaders for the first time under Germany's EU presidency, stressed the urgency of their task by warning that Europe was at an ""important crossroads.""

""If we act decisively now, we have a chance of effectively counteracting the dangers of climate change,"" she said in her invitation to the summit.

Merkel told the British Financial Times newspaper on Wednesday that she wanted ""Europe to take a 'pioneering lead' on meaningful green initiatives.""

Merkel was seconded by former US Vice President, Al Gore who recently picked up an Oscar for his documentary on the ravages of global warming.

Speaking to reporters on a visit to Brussels to address a conference on biofuels, Gore said a European lead on the issue was vital.



""I'm trying to get my country to change its policies, but in

the meantime the European Union is absolutely key to helping the

world make the change it must,"" he said.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that Europe should not only show leadership on combating climate change, but also beef up the security of energy supplies while opening the market to more competition.

""I think there is the real possibility of showing how Europe can lead the debate on climate change, on energy security, and on deregulation in the interest of a more competitive European economy,"" Blair said on Tuesday in London.

EU leaders are expected to endorse plans to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 20 percent by 2020, from 1990 levels, and by 30 percent if other developed and emerging economies, particularly China and India, join them.

The European Union produces about 14 percent of the world's

greenhouse gas emissions while the United States, the world's

largest polluter, produces some 25 percent.

Although the summit is expected to provide a show of unity, tensions are brewing under the surface over the role of nuclear energy and the use of renewable energy sources.

One of the liveliest debates is expected on whether to set a binding target of renewable energy sources meeting 20 percent of Europe's energy needs by 2020, after foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on Monday.

Environmentalists: ""It's not enough""

Although Europe is leading efforts to combat climate change, some environmentalists warned that the EU leaders are not aiming high enough.

""The EU's energy action plan ... will fall a long way short in making Europe's energy more sustainable unless targets for both renewable share and reducing greenhouse gases are raised and tightened,"" said Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Jan Kowalzig.

Energy policy has climbed to the top of the EU political agenda over the last year as oil price spikes and cuts in gas and oil supplies from Russia have spurred the bloc to forge a common strategy to meeting their needs.

However, despite the growing importance attached to energy, the EU has struggled to hammer out a common approach, with member countries often putting national interests first, much to the frustration of the European Commission.

Such is the case with a European Commission idea to inject greater competition into the EU energy market with plans to make large, integrated gas and power companies split their generating and distribution networks.

Leaders are likely to send the plan back to the drawing board with France and to a lesser extent Germany opposed to the idea, which could cause a major shake-up of French and German energy groups.

The summit comes amid a shifting European political landscape with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi emerging shaken from a recent crisis, British Prime Minister Tony Blair increasingly a lame duck, and looming French presidential elections in April and May.

It will also be French President Jacques Chirac's last chance to leave his mark on EU policy-making after nearly 12 years in office fiercely defending French interests during meetings with EU leaders.

Looking ahead as Germany chairs the Group of Eight industrial nations this year, Merkel will likely want to take the conclusions of this week's meetings into the G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Germany in June.",mainstream
516,"Humanity is currently experiencing a “climate emergency,” Pope Francis said, while decrying denial of human-induced climate change as a perverse attitude that endangers all.

“Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, …Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.” Romans 1:22,25 (KJV)

EDITOR’S NOTE: The mythical Roman Catholic “blessed virgin” has nothing in common with the Mary of the Bible, and everything in common with the “mother goddess” as found in the Egyptian ISIS and in Gaia worship. This is why Pope Francis is so involved with the Climate Change hoaxers. It’s not only a highly-profitable billion dollar industry, it’s also the religion of the Roman Catholic “mother”.

“And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.” Matthew 23:9 (KJV)

“We need a conversation that unites us all, because the environmental challenge we are experiencing, and its human roots, affects us all,” Francis said in a statement to the COP23 UN Climate Change summit taking place this week in Bonn, Germany.

Four “perverse” attitudes that obstruct the quest for concrete solutions to the problem of climate change “range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation, or blind trust in technical solutions,” he said.

These perverse attitudes, Francis said, “certainly do not help honest research and sincere and fruitful dialogue on building the future of our planet: denial, indifference, resignation and trust in inadequate solutions.”

In his message, the Pope said that climate change is “one of the most worrisome phenomena that humanity is facing,” while praising the Paris Accord on reducing carbon dioxide as a “historic” agreement.

The agreement, he said, “indicates a clear transition path towards an economic development model of low- or zero-carbon consumption, encouraging solidarity and taking advantage of the close links between the fight against climate change and that against poverty.”

This transition was further prompted by the current “climate emergency,” which calls for greater commitment from the nations of the world, he said. The Pope encouraged those meeting in Bonn, describing the proceedings as an “important phase of the Paris agreement.”

“In such a process it is necessary to keep the willingness to cooperate high,” he said.

While technical solutions to the problem of climate change are necessary, the Pope said, they are “not sufficient” without taking into consideration “the ethical and social aspects and impacts of the new paradigm of development.”

The Pope told the participants that they have a “serious responsibility to act without delay, in the freest way possible in relation to political and economic pressures, overcoming particular interests and behavior.”

The Pope ended his message by expressing his hope that the members of the conference will “consolidate the willingness to adopt truly effective decisions to combat the phenomenon of climate change.”

Last June, President Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Climate Accord, saying that it gravely disadvantaged American workers.

The U.S. will immediately “cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country,” he said.

“This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States,” he said.

Not long after, the World Council of Churches (WCC) censured the President for his decision, stating that the move “has grave consequences for the impoverished and vulnerable, for our children’s children, and for the entire planet, putting at risk people’s access to clean water, food, shelter and secure livelihoods, and undermining efforts for environmental sustainability and for peace.”

In assessing the reactions to the President’s decision, Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer said the hysterical response showed that it had become “an issue of almost religious belief” to the Left, while Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), said that Trump’s decision was a “dishonor” to God.

Last month, the prestigious Lancet journal revealed that pollution-related diseases were responsible for an estimated 9 million premature deaths in 2015, or some 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence combined.

While to date there has not been a single documented case of a person being killed by carbon dioxide related “global warming,” real pollution of air, water and land is killing an average of 25,000 people every day across the globe.

Pollution is not only the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world today, the study in the UK-based journal found, but diseases caused by pollution are responsible for roughly 16 percent of all deaths worldwide—“three times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined and 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence.”

Despite the immense devastation wrought by pollution, the powerful of the world seem determined to ignore it in favor of an ideologically driven crusade against “global warming.”

“Despite its substantial effects on human health, the economy, and the environment, pollution has been neglected, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, and the health effects of pollution are under-estimated in calculations of the global burden of disease,” the Lancet stated.

This health damage from pollution “has particularly been overlooked in both the international development and the global health agendas,” the report declared. While the Paris Climate Accord deals at length with reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it never once mentions the word “pollution” in the entire 27-page document. source",conspiracy
800,"Because of population growth, economic development, and technological change, world and mid-latitudes agriculture will look very different than they do today by the time 2 × CO climate change begins to have major impact. It does not appear that that impact would seriously restrain the growth of world agricultural capacity. However, significant shifts in regional comparative advantage in agriculture would be likely. Because the consequences of 2 × CO climate change for agriculture would vary among countries - some suffering losses, others seeing themselves as potential winners - these consequences could impede international agreements to control climate change. However, even countries gaining agricultural advantage from climate change will need changes in policy to capture the gains. And policies to lessen the costs to the losers will be essential. If global warming continues beyond that associated with 2 × CO , all countries in time would be losers.",mainstream

A world without ice is also hard to visualize, though it is by comparison a much more recent phenomenon: perhaps only thirty-four million years ago, crocodiles swam in a freshwater lake we know as the North Pole, and palm trees grew in Antarctica. The reality is that our planet oscillates between phases with no ice, phases with all ice, and phases in the middle.

1074,"The federal government is ill-prepared to shoulder what could be a trillion-dollar fiscal crisis associated with extreme weather, floods, wildfires and other climate disasters through 2100, federal investigators have found.

In the latest of a series of reports, the Government Accountability Office says that costs of disaster assistance to taxpayers since 2005 have swelled to nearly $500 billion—and they keep getting higher.

“The federal budget, however, does not generally account for disaster assistance provided by Congress or the long-term impacts of climate change on existing federal infrastructure and programs,” GAO found in the 16-page report, which was presented as testimony to Congress by Alfredo Gómez, director of the office’s natural resources and environment team.

Moreover, the government “does not have certain information needed by policymakers to help understand the budgetary impacts of such exposure,” GAO found.

The findings follow a dramatic escalation in federal spending on disaster assistance since 2005. Much of that money—upward of $450 billion—has been appropriated under supplemental spending packages following disasters rather than through the normal budgetary process.

In 2018, Congress approved $91 billion in disaster spending to help communities recover from hurricanes, floods, wildfire and drought. The outflow of disaster dollars has continued into 2019; Congress has passed bills authorizing an additional $19.1 billion, according to federal figures.

The growing frequency and intensity of disasters is being felt in every region of the country and across a broad cross-section of the economy, from energy and real estate to farming and fisheries.

The report includes 21 examples of climate change’s economic impacts, most of which will place additional strain on federal resources. They include infrastructure damage in coastal zones from sea-level rise and storm surges, increased heat-related mortality in the Southeast and Midwest, changes in water supply and demand in the West, and decreased agricultural yields in the southern Plains and Southwest.

GAO also identified two types of potential benefits from climate change: fewer deaths from cold weather in the Upper Midwest and improved agricultural yields in the northern Great Plains and parts of the Northwest, mainly associated with longer growing seasons.

Financial exposure to climate disasters will be felt hardest in three pots of government spending: disaster response, flood and crop insurance, and operation and management of federally owned property and public lands.

Investigators noted that the National Flood Insurance Program, for example, owes the U.S. Treasury $21 billion associated with massive payouts to flood victims dating back to 2005.

Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in May 2019 that federal crop insurance would cost the government an average of about $8 billion annually from 2019 through 2029 due to worsening floods, droughts and other climate stressors.

Federal properties, like Tyndall Air Force Base on the Florida Panhandle, are also facing increased financial exposure from hurricanes and other extreme weather events, GAO said. Hurricane Michael virtually destroyed Tyndall in 2018, and its reconstruction is estimated to cost more than $4 billion (Climatewire, July 3).

Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst and expert on climate adaptation and resilience at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said GAO’s findings are consistent with previous warnings from financial experts that the costs of climate disasters are far exceeding the government’s ability to pay.

Federal agencies “are still treating these disasters as random events. We just throw a bunch of money at them after the fact and assume they won’t happen again. The problem is we’re having these types of disasters every year now,” Moore said.

Spending hundreds of billions of dollars in disaster-specific supplemental relief cannot continue, he added.

“We need to both start accounting for the growing need to respond to disasters within the regular appropriations process,” Moore said. “More importantly, we need to start making investments that reduce our exposure and vulnerability to these types of damages.”

Trump says it will cost millions of U.S. jobs and does not clean up the climate. China, one of the biggest polluters on the planet, gets to not only keep on polluting, but increase it along with India until the year 2030. Maybe this is why Trump says, “This Agreement is less about climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.” The Left and propaganda MSM media have gone berserk, but still do not attack Trump on his facts, and that says it all.

166,"Human societies have experienced climate change since the development of agriculture some 10,000 years ago. These climate changes have often had profound effects on human cultures and societies. They include annual and decadal climate fluctuations such as those described above, as well as large-magnitude changes that occur over centennial to multimillennial timescales. Such changes are believed to have influenced and even stimulated the initial cultivation and domestication of crop plants, as well as the domestication and pastoralization of animals. Human societies have changed adaptively in response to climate variations, although evidence abounds that certain societies and civilizations have collapsed in the face of rapid and severe climatic changes.

Much scientific attention continues to be devoted to a series of severe droughts that occurred between the 11th and 14th centuries. These droughts, each spanning several decades, are well documented in tree-ring records across western North America and in the peatland records of the Great Lakes region. The records appear to be related to ocean temperature anomalies in the Pacific and Atlantic basins, but they are still inadequately understood. The information suggests that much of the United States is susceptible to persistent droughts that would be devastating for water resources and agriculture.

The Little Ice Age was preceded by a period of relatively mild conditions in northern and central Europe. This interval, known as the Medieval Warm Period , occurred from approximately ad 1000 to the first half of the 13th century. Mild summers and winters led to good harvests in much of Europe. Wheat cultivation and vineyards flourished at far higher latitudes and elevations than today. Norse colonies in Iceland and Greenland prospered, and Norse parties fished, hunted, and explored the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland. The Medieval Warm Period is well documented in much of the North Atlantic region, including ice cores from Greenland. Like the Little Ice Age, this time was neither a climatically uniform period nor a period of uniformly warm temperatures everywhere in the world. Other regions of the globe lack evidence for high temperatures during this period.

The Little Ice Age is best known in Europe and the North Atlantic region, which experienced relatively cool conditions between the early 14th and mid-19th centuries. This was not a period of uniformly cool climate, since interannual and decadal variability brought many warm years. Furthermore, the coldest periods did not always coincide among regions; some regions experienced relatively warm conditions at the same time others were subjected to severely cold conditions. Alpine glaciers advanced far below their previous (and present) limits, obliterating farms, churches, and villages in Switzerland , France , and elsewhere. Frequent cold winters and cool, wet summers ruined wine harvests and led to crop failures and famines over much of northern and central Europe. The North Atlantic cod fisheries declined as ocean temperatures fell in the 17th century. The Norse colonies on the coast of Greenland were cut off from the rest of Norse civilization during the early 15th century as pack ice and storminess increased in the North Atlantic. The western colony of Greenland collapsed through starvation, and the eastern colony was abandoned. In addition, Iceland became increasingly isolated from Scandinavia .

Historical records as well as proxy records (particularly tree rings, corals , and ice cores ) indicate that climate has changed during the past 1,000 years at centennial timescales; that is, no two centuries have been exactly alike. During the past 150 years, the Earth system has emerged from a period called the Little Ice Age , which was characterized in the North Atlantic region and elsewhere by relatively cool temperatures. The 20th century in particular saw a substantial pattern of warming in many regions. Some of this warming may be attributable to the transition from the Little Ice Age or other natural causes. However, many climate scientists believe that much of the 20th-century warming, especially in the later decades, resulted from atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide , CO 2 ).

The climatic changes of the past thousand years are superimposed upon variations and trends at both millennial timescales and greater. Numerous indicators from eastern North America and Europe show trends of increased cooling and increased effective moisture during the past 3,000 years. For example, in the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence regions along the U.S.-Canadian border, water levels of the lakes rose, peatlands developed and expanded, moisture-loving trees such as beech and hemlock expanded their ranges westward, and populations of boreal trees, such as spruce and tamarack, increased and expanded southward. These patterns all indicate a trend of increased effective moisture, which may indicate increased precipitation, decreased evapotranspiration due to cooling, or both. The patterns do not necessarily indicate a monolithic cooling event; more complex climatic changes probably occurred. For example, beech expanded northward and spruce southward during the past 3,000 years in both eastern North America and western Europe. The beech expansions may indicate milder winters or longer growing seasons, whereas the spruce expansions appear related to cooler, moister summers. Paleoclimatologists are applying a variety of approaches and proxies to help identify such changes in seasonal temperature and moisture during the Holocene Epoch.

Just as the Little Ice Age was not associated with cool conditions everywhere, so the cooling and moistening trend of the past 3,000 years was not universal. Some regions became warmer and drier during the same time period. For example, northern Mexico and the Yucatan experienced decreasing moisture in the past 3,000 years. Heterogeneity of this type is characteristic of climatic change, which involves changing patterns of atmospheric circulation. As circulation patterns change, the transport of heat and moisture in the atmosphere also changes. This fact explains the apparent paradox of opposing temperature and moisture trends in different regions.

The trends of the past 3,000 years are just the latest in a series of climatic changes that occurred over the past 11,700 years or so—the interglacial period referred to as the Holocene Epoch. At the start of the Holocene, remnants of continental glaciers from the last glaciation still covered much of eastern and central Canada and parts of Scandinavia. These ice sheets largely disappeared by 6,000 years ago. Their absence— along with increasing sea surface temperatures, rising sea levels (as glacial meltwater flowed into the world’s oceans), and especially changes in the radiation budget of Earth’s surface owing to Milankovitch variations (changes in the seasons resulting from periodic adjustments of Earth’s orbit around the Sun)—affected atmospheric circulation. The diverse changes of the past 10,000 years across the globe are difficult to summarize in capsule, but some general highlights and large-scale patterns are worthy of note. These include the presence of early to mid-Holocene thermal maxima in various locations, variation in ENSO patterns, and an early to mid-Holocene amplification of the Indian Ocean monsoon.

Many parts of the globe experienced higher temperatures than today some time during the early to mid-Holocene. In some cases the increased temperatures were accompanied by decreased moisture availability. Although the thermal maximum has been referred to in North America and elsewhere as a single widespread event (variously referred to as the “Altithermal,” “Xerothermic Interval,” “Climatic Optimum,” or “Thermal Optimum”), it is now recognized that the periods of maximum temperatures varied among regions. For example, northwestern Canada experienced its highest temperatures several thousand years earlier than central or eastern North America. Similar heterogeneity is seen in moisture records. For instance, the record of the prairie-forest boundary in the Midwestern region of the United States shows eastward expansion of prairie in Iowa and Illinois 6,000 years ago (indicating increasingly dry conditions), whereas Minnesota’s forests expanded westward into prairie regions at the same time (indicating increasing moisture). The Atacama Desert, located primarily in present-day Chile and Bolivia, on the western side of South America, is one of the driest places on Earth today, but it was much wetter during the early Holocene when many other regions were at their driest. The primary driver of changes in temperature and moisture during the Holocene was orbital variation, which slowly changed the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of solar radiation on Earth’s surface and atmosphere. However, the heterogeneity of these changes was caused by changing patterns of atmospheric circulation and ocean currents.

Because of the global importance of ENSO variation today, Holocene variation in ENSO patterns and intensity is under serious study by paleoclimatologists. The record is still fragmentary, but evidence from fossil corals, tree rings, lake records, climate modeling, and other approaches is accumulating that suggests that (1) ENSO variation was relatively weak in the early Holocene, (2) ENSO has undergone centennial to millennial variations in strength during the past 11,700 years, and (3) ENSO patterns and strength similar to those currently in place developed within the past 5,000 years. This evidence is particularly clear when comparing ENSO variation over the past 3,000 years to today’s patterns. The causes of long-term ENSO variation are still being explored, but changes in solar radiation owing to Milankovitch variations are strongly implicated by modeling studies.

Much of Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent are under the strong influence of an annual climatic cycle known as the Indian Ocean monsoon. The climate of this region is highly seasonal, alternating between clear skies with dry air (winter) and cloudy skies with abundant rainfall (summer). Monsoon intensity, like other aspects of climate, is subject to interannual, decadal, and centennial variations, at least some of which are related to ENSO and other cycles. Abundant evidence exists for large variations in monsoon intensity during the Holocene Epoch. Paleontological and paleoecological studies show that large portions of the region experienced much greater precipitation during the early Holocene (11,700–6,000 years ago) than today. Lake and wetland sediments dating to this period have been found under the sands of parts of the Sahara Desert. These sediments contain fossils of elephants, crocodiles, hippopotamuses, and giraffes, together with pollen evidence of forest and woodland vegetation. In arid and semiarid parts of Africa, Arabia, and India, large and deep freshwater lakes occurred in basins that are now dry or are occupied by shallow, saline lakes. Civilizations based on plant cultivation and grazing animals, such as the Harappan civilization of northwestern India and adjacent Pakistan, flourished in these regions, which have since become arid. These and similar lines of evidence, together with paleontological and geochemical data from marine sediments and climate-modeling studies, indicate that the Indian Ocean monsoon was greatly amplified during the early Holocene, supplying abundant moisture far inland into the African and Asian continents. This amplification was driven by high solar radiation in summer, which was approximately 7 percent higher 11,700 years ago than today and resulted from orbital forcing (changes in Earth’s eccentricity, precession, and axial tilt). High summer insolation resulted in warmer summer air temperatures and lower surface pressure over continental regions and, hence, increased inflow of moisture-laden air from the Indian Ocean to the continental interiors. Modeling studies indicate that the monsoonal flow was further amplified by feedbacks involving the atmosphere, vegetation, and soils. Increased moisture led to wetter soils and lusher vegetation, which in turn led to increased precipitation and greater penetration of moist air into continental interiors. Decreasing summer insolation during the past 4,000–6,000 years led to the weakening of the Indian Ocean monsoon.",mainstream
358,"Organic Farming Can Save Us from Global Warming, Climate Change

Organic farming can reverse the agriculture ecosystem from a carbon source to a carbon sink.

Nothing in this article is meant to argue any of the nuances surrounding climate change/global warming. None. Of. The nuances. In fact, a handful of Chinese researchers went with the current climate change premise – and discovered pleasant results that can put many fears aside.

If going on the basis that greenhouse gas emissions are devastating the Earth, and that 35% of them come from agriculture; then we’re actually creating more problems by allowing Big Biotech, GMOs and exponential pesticide/chemical fertilizer use to spread unchecked. Based on this premise, these methods create more carbon release. Interestingly, organic farming turns that carbon source into a “carbon sink,” which means it absorbs more carbon than it releases.



A previous study from China placed synthetic nitrogen fertilizer as a big culprit for GHG. Although they acknowledge its usefulness in agriculture, they also acknowledge the eco-side effects as well as their primary role as the world’s biggest purveyor of N fertilizer. When the study above used nothing but chemical fertilizer, researchers found much less yield, more GHG as well as degradation of soil quality.

They find that making full use of crop residues as forage for cattle, collecting and composting cattle manure, and replacing part of the chemical fertilizer input with organic manure have been successfully shown to be ideal choices to reduce energy waste and cut GHG emissions without crop yield losses.

If their conclusions are correct, then this is just one more way to solve not only the big fear induced on the globe by notions of climate change (i.e. global warming), but also dispels myths of “not enough” resources to feed the world. And that can also quell manufactured fears of overpopulation.

With hope, this study dissipates insidious and malicious attempts by psychopaths to further acceptance of unnatural depopulation plans. It’s time to do away with psychopathic and false Malthusian theories which pave the way for untold suffering and incredible austerity. If there were an actual population problem, it would be remedied by raising living standards, using better food production techniques and allowing for its access – not by suppression (which tends to explode population). Don’t believe the psychopaths – no one needs to be “thrown from the boat.”

The likes of Monsanto and DuPont love to use scarcity to scare people into acquiescence, claiming that they are the hunger saviors of the world. Not only has the opposite been shown by them in the last 20 years, but their methods are actually destroying those resources that they bank on being so rare.

What if the world knew the truth?

217,"Today is the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

On April 22, 1970, 20 million Americans rallied to demand protection for the environment. The hope is that, today, many more people around the world will mobilise for the cause, albeit while adhering to physical distancing and lockdown guidelines.

With carbon emissions and global temperature records at an all-time high and wildfires, floods and other extreme events surging around the world, never has the need for climate action been more urgent.

And yet, right now, the world is distracted by another global emergency - the COVID-19 pandemic. The immediate focus has to be on preventing yet more deaths and alleviating, wherever possible, the suffering inflicted by this terrible disease. But for some political leaders this has been a reason, or even a convenient excuse, to put plans to tackle climate change to one side. Whereas both crises stem from the same root cause - humanity’s relentless exploitation of the planet’s resources. Until this is addressed, catastrophic climate change and further disease outbreaks are inevitable.

Destruction of habitats not only contributes to emissions but also brings animals, and the viruses they carry, into contact with humans. Global warming does not just create human refugees. Animals too migrate in search of cooler climes, spreading pathogens to new hosts around the world. Eating and trading wild animals further increases the chances of spillover. Wildlife, oil, water, trees, minerals; you name it, we profit from turning the planet's riches into commodities. And it is killing us.

Al Jazeera's environmental solutions series, earthrise, celebrates the people committed to protecting life on earth and turning the climate crisis around.

To mark this day, we look back at five of our films, each of which takes on an extra significance in the context of the current pandemic. These stories prove how far one person's determination to make a difference can go. And that when this determination is met with support, from the public or from business and political leaders, then transformation becomes truly possible.

The human footprint is so huge that it affects three-quarters of the land on the planet. Only a few pockets of wilderness remain.

In response, a worldwide movement is under way to ""rewild"" the countryside. One initiative, in Chile's Patagonia, is exceeding all expectations.

In 2004, philanthropists Kris and Doug Tompkins bought a sheep ranch and set about restoring its overgrazed lands. Their venture went on to become one of the biggest conservation projects in history. Recently it has expanded even further with the support of the Chilean state.

The incidence of emerging infectious diseases is on the rise. The majority of these originate in animals. Deforestation, which leads to pathogens moving out of the woods with their animal hosts, is a major cause. It is also responsible for approximately 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

Your clothes may play a part in this. Every year, 150 million trees are pulped to create viscose and rayon to feed the fast-fashion industry.

The non-profit company, Canopy, is campaigning to protect the world's ancient forests. In Sweden, it is working with major brands to transform the high street.

Washing your hands is a key defence against coronavirus. But what if you are one of the 785 million people without access to clean water? Now, more than ever, every drop counts.

Jordan is one of the world's driest countries. What is more, more than 35 billion litres of water are lost there each year due to illegal tapping and faulty pipes.

That is why the Water Wise Women initiative is so important. Three thousand women have been trained in water conservation and plumbing. They are helping preserve their country's water supply drip by drip.

The rivers of the city of Doula in Cameroon are choked with so much plastic waste that you would struggle to see a drop of water. Like other rivers around the world, they are a symbol of how we plunder the planet's resources, only to swiftly discard the products we make with them.

But Ismael Essome is living proof one person can make a difference. He is on a mission to change attitudes to waste in Doula and, from there, to inspire the whole of Africa.

As countries around the world enter lockdown and the air becomes cleaner, we are gaining a tantalising glimpse of a greener world.

We are at a fork in the road. Once the worst ravages of the pandemic are over, which way will we go? Towards decarbonised economies and a sustainable future? Or back to business as usual, a rise in emissions and a future beset by extreme climate events - and, most likely, further pandemics?

The people of the Danish island of Samso chose the path of sustainability. In the process, they proved that going green makes good business sense and that a healthy environment is a prerequisite for a resilient and healthy society.

268,"Just 38% of Americans Believe in Man Made Climate Change

Despite relentless propaganda campaign about scientific “consensus.”

Despite relentless propagandizing about a global “consensus” on climate change, a new poll has found that just 38% of Americans believe in man-made global warming.

Asked by YouGov if they agreed that “humans are mainly responsible for climate change,” the majority of people in France, Germany and only a slight minority in the UK disagreed.

A minority of Americans, 38%, believe that human activity is driving climate change, which is even less than in China, where the figure is 45%.

It appears as though Greta Thunberg’s weeks-long virtue signalling tour to America is doing little to shift public opinion.

The fact that so many people reject the anthropogenic argument is quite remarkable given how intensively it is pushed by the media and the establishment scientific community.

As we highlighted last week, in a showcase of the ironies that surround the entire field of debate, a ship carrying passengers who included a group of ‘Climate Change Warriors’ who are concerned about melting Arctic ice got stuck in the ice halfway between Norway and the North Pole.

428,"Bristol’s two NHS hospital trusts have joined the international movement to declare a climate emergency, recognising the impact climate change is having on the world.

North Bristol NHS Trust and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust are among the first NHS organisations in the UK to make the declaration, which shows a clear and positive commitment to tackle climate change and the effects on the health of our population.

With climate change labelled the greatest threat to health in the 21st century, a range of conditions related to heat, cold, extreme weather and air pollution are predicted to rise.

To lead the way in healthcare in the city, the two Trusts have set ambitious goals to become carbon neutral by 2030.

Harnessing the huge enthusiasm of more than 20,000 staff the organisations have pledged to take action on:
• single use plastics, such as in wards, operating theatres and catering;
• energy use for heating and lighting;
• vehicle emissions from staff and patient travel and goods deliveries;

North Bristol NHS Trust Chief Executive Andrea Young said: “The NHS is the biggest organisation and employer in Bristol, and as a major buyer of goods and services, we are uniquely a big part of the problem and of the solution.

“To provide high quality care the NHS uses huge amounts of energy, food, water, medicine and equipment – all of which contribute to our carbon footprint.

“We can also harness the power of thousands of staff who are highly motivated to make a difference and improve people’s lives.

“We want to publically acknowledge the huge threat of climate change, do as much as possible to tackle it ourselves and, as anchors in our community, encourage collaborative action.”

University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust Chief Executive Robert Woolley said: “Preventing avoidable illness, promoting health and wellbeing and being operationally resilient are all fundamental to the future of the NHS.

“Taking more action now to protect the environment will help us to meet all of these aims, as there is strong evidence about the impact of climate change on health.

“We’ve set ambitious targets to become carbon neutral by 2030, and are already taking major steps in this area, including investing in more sustainable lighting and heating.

“Lots of our staff are already involved in many ways from taking more sustainable transport options to get to and from work to looking at the changes they can make, however small, to be more environmentally-friendly in their areas of work.

“The quicker we can take action on climate change, the quicker we’ll improve the health of people right now as well as for future generations.”

Marvin Rees, Mayor of Bristol, said: “This is another really exciting step towards building a whole city response to the climate emergency. The commitment from University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust and North Bristol NHS Trust to tackle climate change reflects our One City Plan ambition of creating a carbon neutral and climate resilient city.

The two Trusts are institutions in the city with large impacts on the environment, and so it’s enormously positive they recognise their importance and pledge to take action on this important issue.”

Some of the work the hospital Trusts have already been doing includes:
• Reducing use of Desflurane, an anaesthetic gas which has a much greater environmental impact than alternative anaesthetics;
• Reducing car journeys via lift-share, walking and cycle-to-work schemes for staff;
• Patients being discharged from the Bristol Royal Infirmary and Southmead Hospital at risk of further illness from cold or damp homes will be referred for home energy efficiency measures such as central heating, draught-proofing and insulation;
• Improvements to lighting and heating to reduce carbon emissions at hospitals run by University Hospitals Bristol;
• Electric bikes are used by the Early Supported Discharged Team at South Bristol Community Hospital to visit stroke patients across the city and into North Somerset at home to provide therapy;
• A range of nature initiatives at Southmead Hospital including wildflower planting, bird boxes, ponds, and insect hotels and home-made lavender bags for patients; and
• Sustainable food at Southmead Hospital including locally-sourced, seasonal food for patients and staff, a weekly organic veg stall open to the public and staff allotments.

In Bristol around 300 people a year already die early from diseases related to poor air quality . Across England, 863 people died early as a result of the heatwave in summer 2018.

The government has set a target for the UK to become carbon neutral by 2050. Bristol City Council has committed to carbon neutrality by 2025 and for the city as a whole to achieve this by 2030 through the One City Plan. These commitments are among the most ambitious targets in Europe and the UK.

Bristol City Council, the West of England Combined Authority, North Somerset Council, South Gloucestershire Council and the University of Bristol have all recently declared a climate emergency. Only two other areas of the NHS have also done so.",mainstream
1168,"Look, it’s a great pleasure today to have Minister Hunt, our Federal Health Minister and indeed Minister Fyles, our NT Minister for Health as well.

This is a new facility. We've only been in the new facility for around about three months, and that's fantastic that Minister Hunt has been able to visit us here today and has been so supportive of what we're doing. The initiative itself came through back in 2004, 2005.

It was at the result of the first Bali bombing.

But I'll turn, if I may, to Minister Hunt.

Thank you. And look, thanks very much to Professor Len Notaras, Natasha Fyles, to all of the team here at the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre.

An amazing team. Abigail Trewin has shown us through, as the Head of Disaster Preparedness, but just to meet incredibly capable staff who are committed.

And this centre is a Territory treasure. It's a national treasure but it's actually a global icon.

The global standards for deployable disaster preparedness teams were developed here and developed on the back of the Australian experience.

A team which, in many ways, had its genesis in the tragedy of the Bali bombings but which has evolved and been deployed around the world since.

It brings together the absolute best of the Territory and Australia.

We know that at any one time there are 35 staff, 750 on call from around Australia. Our people with extraordinary experience whether it's in logistics, whether it's in pharmacy, whether it is trauma surgeons, whether it's our amazing nurses and paramedics. All are on call and they have day jobs.

But in many ways, the pinnacle of their professional career is the training they receive through the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre and the capacity to be deployed at short notice to save lives and protect lives.

It's interesting that there are over 300 who are on the waiting list. That indicates what an extraordinary privilege and professional source of pride and progress it is for the individuals involved and they believe in their work.

So, against that background, I am delighted to announce that the Australian Government will invest $67.6 million in the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre over the next four years.

This will support staff. This will support logistics and equipment and it will support training and deployment – all of the things that this centre was created for.

We never know when it will be needed. It could be an earthquake. It could be a tsunami. It could be a terrorism event or it could be a disease.

As we speak, four Australians are on their way to a mission in Samoa to deal with the outbreak of measles there. And that's an example of the real-time work of our trauma teams and that's about saving lives and protecting lives.

So I am delighted to announce the Australian Government contribution, and to thank each and every one of the staff who are based here in Darwin and working either here on site or at Royal Darwin Hospital.

And to thank all of those Australian medical and logistical personnel who give their time, who are part of our mobile deployable teams but at the same time, build the skills of our state and territory hospital and emergency response teams around the country.

Thank you. We welcome the Federal Government's announcement. We're very proud of the National Critical Care and Trauma Centre being based here in the Northern Territory.

And we are incredibly grateful for the Federal Government for this continued support.

So, on behalf of the Northern Territory Government, we thank the team here on the ground but we also thank the Federal Government for their recognition of this amazing team from the Northern Territory. Thank you.

Great. Happy to take any questions.

In the media release, the announcement, it talks about expanding the capacity here. How will this funding expand the capacity of the centre from what's been available previously?

Well, obviously, we're in the process of fitting out and making sure that whether it's the incredible innovation with regards to storage and classification, it allows the progressive building of those stores, the progressive building of those systems, and the progressive building of the training and education for the teams here in Darwin but around the country.

In terms of the longer term funding, is that something the Government would consider at all?

Well let me make this guarantee, that my belief and my expectation is that under every circumstance, the National Critical Care Centre will be based here in Darwin and fully funded by the Federal Government for the next 50 years.

It's as certain as anything can be in parliamentary analysis.

On a slightly different topic, what more can the Government do on drought assistance?

Look, the drought is something of immense importance – not just to Australians who are experiencing it, but common human compassion has brought an understandable and I think a very important human response where Australians are concerned and caring for other Australians.

So right now we are delivering Farm Household Assistance, the support to local governments and, as the Prime Minister indicated, we are analysing additional work through consulting with communities.

And the Prime Minister's already made it clear that he expects to be making further and better statements in the very near future.

How much will that coming drought strategy focus on the health and the mental health of people in those drought stricken communities?

That has been a very important and ongoing part of what we're doing. So we've been able to provide both online services, mobile services for psychological support.

We've only just, on the 1 November provided additional consultation services throughout Australia – not just to drought affected communities but to rural and remote communities around Australia – for Telehealth.

In particular, that gives people the chance to talk to their doctors about problems, it might be a physical problem or it might be a mental health problem, that opens up far greater capacity for people in rural and remote Australia, in drought affected areas to get real time help from their doctors and those services only started in the last week.

Why is it that you believe that small businesses in regional areas need government support at a time like this?

Small businesses in a drought affected area can be doing it very tough.

So you have the primary effect on the farmer but it could be a stock feed supplier, it could be a hardware store, it could be someone in hairdressing or in hospitality.

All of those communities can have a very significant flow on effect and we want to make sure that we can keep the capacity in the towns as well as supporting the individuals who are affected.

How does the Government help keep farmers on the land?

So I think the important thing is the Farm Household Assistance package, the support for the communities around them, and then the knowledge that we will continue to be deeply engaged.

We've seen more than 500 veterans take their own lives in this country in the past 20 years.

What is the Government going to do to better support the health and mental health of people who return from serving overseas?

The support for our veterans is, I think, at an absolute national priority.

It was one of the first things that the Prime Minister did after the election, he convened a roundtable of specialists, MP’s, MP’s with military service, to look at the issue of veterans’ mental health and suicide prevention.

At present, we are investing over $11 billion a year in the broad health, mental health and support services for our veterans.

There’s specifically a $280 million package and I understand that the Veterans Health Minister is currently working on next steps which is ultimately our deep and profound responsibility to protect and care for those who have protected and cared for us.

There are calls today for a royal commission, should that be something that is considered?

Well, I’ll respectfully leave that for the Veterans’ Affairs Minister.

And on the drought, what's the risk if the Government doesn't help farmers now?

Well we have a critical role to continue what we are doing.

I have to say, as the Prime Minister has said, this has been the first call on the budget and that's ultimately about saving lives and protecting lives.

Yes, there’s an economic element to maintaining that capacity, but it's something far more profound.

It's about the commitment to those Australians who have helped develop the nation, who provide so much of our export capacity, and also when we talk about farming communities they provide an extraordinary amount of hope, and opportunity, employment and economic benefit for Indigenous Australia.

Do you believe that vaping is safe?

No. My view is that we have some of the strongest laws in the country and with Natasha, just last week, all of the state and territory and Commonwealth governments came together to reaffirm that we have and will maintain some of the strongest laws in the world on nicotine based e-cigarettes.

And we have also referred our health concerns on non-nicotine vaping to the chief medical and chief health officers around the country.

So precisely because of the evidence coming out of the FDA in the United States that vaping of any form can be an onramp to smoking or to nicotine use but also because of the direct concerns about the respiratory effects of vaping of any form; we have referred that off to the most experienced medical leaders in the country.

I don’t know, Natasha, if you want to add anything on that?

COAG last week, all the state and territory health ministers came together.

We certainly had a discussion around vaping and we don't want anything to impact on those strong laws that we have around nicotine and smoking products.

And as the Minister federally has said, we've referred that to the leaders in each jurisdiction as well as Commonwealth around looking at what we can do to make sure that we protect Australians.

Question for either or both of you, do you think it's appropriate for doctors to be prescribing e-liquid nicotine?

So as far as we are aware, there is very little of that actually occurring. That’s the advice from the AMA and we will leave that to them.

But as we produce the evidence, we are releasing the evidence and that's why we commissioned over a year ago, the Australian National University to do a deep long term epidemiological study on the impacts of vaping on health.

But we have some of the strongest laws in the world at present and we will be maintaining those laws in relation to nicotine based vaping but we have referred the deep concerns about the potential for non-nicotine vaping to be an onramp and to have respiratory concerns in their own right.

And they have gone off to our chief medical officers around the country precisely because of these issues.

(Inaudible) rural doctor training program in the Northern Territory has seen numbers of people enrolling fall by about a third in recent years.

Does it concern you that there isn't a pipeline of talent coming through to service this region?

Yeah. So around the country one of our most important challenges is to bring young doctors into rural and regional practice.

And so in order to do that one of the things that we discussed last week was working on a national partnership with each of the states and territories on a new model of primary care and that model of primary care is based on Medicare but also twinning that, we've pooled funding from the territories or the states.

And that is hopefully going to create a much more integrated practice.

That's one of the things I'll be discussing at the National Aboriginal and Community Controlled Health Organisations conference today. And interestingly, we can take lessons from our Indigenous health models for primary care around the country.

Question for both – it’s sort of for you and Natasha Fyles. Natasha, in October, you put out a media release saying that the Territory Labor government would fight the $5 million the Federal Government was ripping out of Territory hospitals, did you get the results that you wanted out of COAG or do you feel like Territory hospitals are still being short-changed?

So we had a very productive health ministers meeting last week. All the states and territories ministers agreed that we have key focus areas around particularly aged care and NDIS intersecting with our hospital system but also around mental health and we saw that interim report from the Productivity Commission.

But we are now going to work in partnership with the Federal Government as we head towards that National Health Reform Agreement which we're hoping will be signed mid-next year.

Certainly, in terms of our hospitals, we need to make sure that they have the funding and that's a responsibility of both the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments.

But we also had conversations around in terms of making sure we have investment in primary health care and stopping Australians and Territorians from needing that acute care.

So we look forward to those conversations continuing.

Mr Hunt, do you still think the NT government is the most incompetent in Australia?

Well let's just put it this way, I think we've made very good progress and we are working together in a way which is really important for the Territorians and has been a breakthrough.

So last week, I think was a line in the sand and it's a new partnership going forwards; partnership on mental health, partnership on primary care and an agreement on hospitals.

Eleven thousand scientists have put their names to a document declaring a climate crisis. As Health Minister, how much do the health implications of emergency-like conditions concern you?

Look, we include climate, obviously, in our assessments of health around the country.

As former environment minister, I've been passionate about our action on climate change and we led the world on the Montreal Protocol which reduced projections of emissions by 72 billion tonnes; 72 billion tonnes through what we did on ozone protection but with an additional element in relation to climate change and reduced CO2 equivalency.

And so that work was arguably one of the most important things that any country has ever done to reduce global emissions.

It led into the Paris conference; it paved the way for the Paris conference and at a moment when global talks collapsed, Australia stepped in and that 72 million tonne reduction against baseline emissions between now and 2050 is the equivalent of almost two years of entire global emissions from one agreement which Australia led. Thank you very much.

Well this document says specifically that global governments are not doing enough. So what more can you do?

Well we- we will continue to meet and beat our targets. I remember when we came in in 2013, many of the experts said we would never achieve our 2020 targets; we would fall short by 500 and 700 million tonnes of.

Yeah. With all due respect Minister, though, these scientists are saying that these goals aren’t enough. So what more can we do?

And we've beaten those targets and now, we'll meet and beat out 2030 targets and what we've done with 2050 is produce 72 billion tonnes of reductions.

So our task collectively and individually is to each and all of us do what we can to help reduce those emissions.

And I would say that in terms of what we've done with that Montreal Protocol, the protocol agreement, the 72 billion tonnes which came out of the Dubai Roadmap is leading the world in real reductions in emissions. Okay. Thank you very much.",mainstream
171,"Antarctica is the enormous icy continent which covers the Earth’s South Pole. Twelve countries have made territorial claims there and 52 nations share international control over the desolate land mass which has no single owner or formal government.

Since 1961, Antarctica (which comprises 10 percent of the total land mass on Earth) has been used exclusively for peaceful scientific research purposes. This global experimental science lab operates year-round, although weather conditions cut it off from the outside world on a regular basis.

Antarctica has been flagged as a place of special interest by such researchers, many of whom are highly credible with advanced academic degrees.

Royalty and other high-profile visitors to Antarctica include:
• Admiral Richard Byrd (visitor from 1928 to 1956 and leader of the 1947 Operation High Jump who said the U.S. was making defensive preparations against “enemy fighters that can fly from pole to pole with tremendous speed”)
• U.K. Prince Harry (2013 visitor on a charity fundraiser to highlight wounded soldiers and difficult career transitions)
• King Juan Carlos of Spain (2014 visitor and thrill-seeker checking off an item on his bucket list)
• Russian Orthodox Patriarch of Moscow Kiril (2016 visitor who blessed an Orthodox chapel)
• U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (2016 visitor said to be seeking information about climate change)
• U.S. Apollo 11 Moon astronaut Buzz Aldrin (2016 visitor who tweeted about getting ready to “go to the launchpad” and who subsequently had to be evacuated and quarantined)

In July 2018, this writer covered three Antarctic conspiracies with reasons why some people believe they are actually true:
• There are Big Pyramids Buried in Antarctic Ice
• Other Earth Species and/or Aliens Have a Portal to their Underworld in Antarctica

On July 12, 2017, news that an enormous chunk of ice in Antarctica had split off and fallen into the sea circulated in scientific periodicals. Could this have something to do with the VIP visitors between 2013 and 2016?

The iceberg in question was part of the Larsen C ice shelf, estimated to contain a trillion tons of ice – more or less – “enough to fill up two Lake Eries.”

Because the ice was already floating in the Antarctic waters, experts say it won’t cause a dramatic rise in sea levels that would flood low-lying areas and destroy coastal cities.

Martin O’Leary is a Swansea University glaciologist and team member of the British-based MIDAS Project, an Antarctic research group, who made this official statement:

“Although this is a natural event, and we’re not aware of any link to human-induced climate change, this puts the ice shelf in a very vulnerable position. This is the furthest back that the ice front has been in recorded history. We’re going to be watching very carefully for signs that the rest of the shelf is becoming unstable.”

Ufologist who study UFOs/ETs are wondering if recent visits to Antarctica have been prompted by the melting ice?

Google Earth images of large objects that resemble pyramids have been published for public inspection and speculation:

“Three structures have apparently been found, two roughly 10 miles inland and the other close to the coast.”

This raises the interesting question: Was there an ancient civilization in this area between 34-100 million years ago, a time when geophysicists say the climate there was warm and tropical?

American military aircraft personnel have reported spotting unidentified flying aircraft over the trans-Atlantic mountain range on multiple occasions which traveled at exceptionally high speeds, stopped on a dime, and hovered in mid-air.

Linda Moulton Howe has investigated UFO-related cases since 1989. Recently, the Stanford graduate shared insider information from a retired U.S. Navy SEAL who goes by the code name Spartan 1.

The military veteran claims he was part of “a Special Operations mission to investigate huge structures deep under Antarctic ice discovered by deep-ground and ice-penetrating radar at the beginning of the 21st Century.”

Spartan 1 said that, in 2003, he and a team of fellow Navy SEALs were dispatched to check out a puzzling anomaly located near the Beardmore Glacier, about 93 miles from the American McMurdo Station. A series of 8-sided structures had been mapped at this location.

When the SEALs got to one of these shiny black octagon structures, scientists had already dug out the top layer. The structure was built on top of and connected two other black octagons embedded in the 2-mile-thick ice. This single octagon stretched out over almost 62 acres, with most of it hidden below the ice.

According to Spartan 1, the octagon had been discovered in the early 14th or 15th century when nobody understood what they had found. The SEALs determined that each octagon proved to be a hinged doorway which led to vast structures covering acres deep beneath the Antarctic ice which were heated and back-lighted by an unknown lime-green energy source with no fixtures, wiring, lamps or bulbs.

The interior of the octagons was heated to 68F to 72F with no outside generators present. The ceilings measured between 22 and 28 feet tall. The walls ranged from 18- to 30-feet thick and lined with hieroglyphic-like symbols. One wall panel looked to the Navy SEAL like a star chart.

“As far as the aliens go, there’s more than one race and we’ve been talking to several races since the 1950s and 1960s.”

Spartan 1 said the Antarctic aliens closely resembled humans and had bio-engineered us (homo sapiens sapiens) millennia ago.

Will parts of this mysterious continent be exposed to satellite imagery and Google Earth for the first time in quite a long time, disclosing to the rest of the world secrets beneath the ice that world governments don’t want the rest of us to know about?",conspiracy
34,"California’s massive Public Employees’ Retirement System has released the first climate risk assessment of its $394-billion pension fund.

The draft report, which was submitted to the CalPERS board this month, found that one-fifth of the fund’s public market investments were in sectors that have high exposure to climate change. Those include energy, materials and buildings, transportation, and agriculture, food and forestry.

“It underscores what a big challenge we have on our hands,” said state Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), who wrote the 2018 law that mandated the report. “There’s a lot of money at stake.”

The financial toll of climate change stems partly from its physical impacts, such as rising sea levels, fiercer storms and heat waves. However, companies’ bottom lines can also be affected by new regulations intended to curb warming, by lawsuits that seek to hold polluters accountable for climate damages, and by market trends, like the fast-dropping price of renewable energy.

Together, these factors create quite a puzzle for investors trying to maximize their returns.

“There’s no question that climate issues and warming are going to affect economies big time,” said Brad Barber, a finance professor at UC Davis. But “there’s still questions about how it’s going to impact various industries.”

Allen introduced Senate Bill 964 to make sure that CalPERS, which has a long history of climate activism, was fully considering such questions when it came to its own holdings.

“It’s ultimately smart portfolio management,” he said. “If we are not taking into account this stunning and catastrophic reality, we’re doing our funds a disservice.”

CalPERS is the largest public pension fund in the United States and manages retirement benefits for roughly 2 million state government employees.

SB 964 also requires California’s State Teachers’ Retirement System to produce a similar report for its $248-billion pension fund. That assessment is expected later this month, and both will be presented to the Legislature by Jan. 1. CalPERS and CalSTRS must then submit additional climate risk reports every three years until 2035. (Neither organization would comment on the assessments until they are finalized.)

Beyond identifying the 20% of investments in climate-exposed sectors, the CalPERS draft report did not go into great detail about the sources of climate risk to its portfolio.

At a board meeting this week, Anne Simpson, CalPERS’ investment director, said that was partly because the data they had to work with were “thin and frail.” Less than half of the 10,000-plus companies in their portfolio voluntarily disclose information about their carbon emissions, she said.

Nevertheless, the report concluded that utilities were the fund’s largest source of greenhouse gases. It said that was encouraging because utilities can choose where they get electricity and many are already transitioning to cleaner sources.

However, CalPERS board members and activists pointed out that the report omitted what are known as Scope 3 emissions — the indirect emissions associated with a company’s supply chain or the end use of their products.

For companies that sell coal, oil and gas, these emissions can make up 80% to 90% of their overall carbon footprint, said Nicole Pinko, a corporate analyst and engagement specialist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which has pushed for a rigorous accounting of the sector’s climate risks.

By leaving out Scope 3 emissions, she said, the report underestimated the vulnerability of the fund’s fossil fuel holdings to future regulations like a carbon tax, or to market changes that could cause their assets to rapidly lose value.

“That would happen faster than the fund would be able to react,” said Steven Feit, an attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, which backed SB 964. And it’s exactly “the kind of thing that pension funds should be protecting against,” he said.

When questioned by State Controller Betty Yee on Monday, CalPERS’ Beth Richtman disclosed that she did have estimates for Scope 3 emissions, but that they were not included in the draft report because the figures were considered unreliable and probably included duplicate emissions.

For instance, tailpipe emissions from cars would qualify as Scope 3 emissions for both automakers and oil producers, and would be counted twice if CalPERS held investments in both, said Richtman, the agency’s managing investments director for sustainable investments.

Richtman said that the Scope 3 emissions for CalPERS’ portfolio totaled 58 million to 68 million tons of carbon dioxide per year — about as much as the annual emissions from Finland.

That’s far greater than the 23 million to 24 million tons of CO per year that CalPERS estimated for the companies in its global equity portfolio based on what they emit directly and their electricity use. (Several board members encouraged Richtman and her staff to include the Scope 3 estimates in the revised report, even if they are uncertain.)

Some environmental activists also criticized the assessment for declining to quantify the potential financial impacts of climate lawsuits and for its failure to name the specific companies that presented the greatest climate-related risks.

“I’m here to express our profound disappointment,” Vanessa Warheit, the executive director of Fossil Free California, said at the public meeting Monday. She added that the report’s shortcomings made it “impossible to accurately assess where and how climate-related risk is distributed.”

Outside experts, on the other hand, praised the report as a good step toward making climate risk a central piece of CalPERS’ investment strategy, rather than a footnote.

“I think that’s one of the most positive signs, because that’s putting your money where your mouth is,” said Jesse Keenan, who studies climate-related financial risk at Harvard. “It will set a precedent for a lot of other investors.”

Keenan said he suspects that a much larger share of CalPERS’ portfolio is at risk from climate change, but it will take time to identify this exposure in industries that don’t regularly report on climate risk, such as apparel and aviation, and to extract it from those who manage some of the funds CalPERS invests in.

He said he expects to see more detailed information on individual holdings in an upcoming Asset Owner report, which CalPERS will compile according to new international guidelines for climate risk reporting. That report is expected to be released in 2020.

Critics complained that the report did not shed much light on how climate risk will actually shape CalPERS’ investment decisions going forward.

Environmental groups like Fossil Free California would like to see CalPERS divest completely from its fossil fuel holdings. (State law has already forced CalPERS and CalSTRS to divest from coal, and earlier this year the University of California announced it would rid its portfolio of all fossil fuel investments.)

The issue remains deeply divisive, and Pinko said the new report offers a strong defense of CalPERS’ current strategy of engaging with companies rather than walking away. For instance, their efforts helped prod Shell to include Scope 3 emissions in its greenhouse gas reduction goals, and to elicit better disclosure from many other companies.

“They do a really nice job of outlining some of the victories they’ve had, and why they feel that having a seat at the table might be a better option for them than divestment,” Pinko said.

But the report doesn’t address whether remaining invested in industries with climate risks is a good financial move for the fund — and some say it’s a difficult question to answer. “It’s still fast-evolving science, if you will,” Barber said.

While the physical impacts of climate change are clear, analysts don’t understand how they will affect specific regions, business sectors and companies well enough to advise investors about whether to steer clear. It may be premature to abandon corporations that might be able to adapt.

“Just because these industries are at risk doesn’t mean they that won’t be able to transform themselves into valuable enterprises,” Barber said.

Both CalPERS and CalSTRS will have to weigh these considerations as they work to align themselves with an executive order issued by Gov. Gavin Newsom in September directing them to put their funds toward investments that will decrease carbon emissions and increase climate resiliency. CalPERS has pledged to make its portfolio carbon-neutral by 2050.

It’s a particularly sensitive issue for CalPERS since many of its beneficiaries have spent their careers on the front lines of climate change, Pinko said. They include the firefighters who battle the state’s blazes and the civil servants who grapple with coastal flooding, poor air quality and the myriad other consequences of a warming world.

“These are their investments,” she said.",mainstream
1280,"Rising mean sea level, it is proposed, is a significant indicator of global climate change. The principal factors that can have contributed to the observed increases of global mean sea level in recent decades are thermal expansion of the oceans and the discharge of polar ice sheets. Calculations indicate that thermal expansion cannot be the sole factor responsible for the observed rise in sea level over the last 40 years; significant discharges of polar ice must also be occurring. Global warming, due in some degree presumably to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, has been opposed by the extraction of heat necessary to melt the discharged ice. During the past 40 years more than 50,000 cubic kilometers of ice has been discharged and has melted, reducing the surface warming that might otherwise have occurred by as much as a factor of 2. The transfer of mass from the polar regions to a thin spherical shell covering all the oceans should have increased the earth's moment of inertia and correspondingly reduced the speed of rotation by about 1.5 parts in 108. This accounts for about three quarters of the observed fractional reduction in the earth's angular velocity since 1940. Monitoring of global mean sea level, ocean surface temperatures, and the earth's speed of rotation should be complemented by monitoring of the polar ice sheets, as is now possible by satellite altimetry. All parts of the puzzle need to be examined in order that a consistent picture emerge.",mainstream
301,"With No Visitors, Australian Scuba Companies Are Planting Coral On Great Barrier Reef

While the Australian tourism industry may have dried up in the coronavirus lockdown, dive tour operators have decided to put their time to good use by planting coral along the Great Barrier Reef.

Family-owned Cairns-based company Passions of Paradise have provided a catamaran and fuel. Other businesses involved include Wavelength, Ocean Freedom, Sailaway and Quicksilver Cruises. They are working alongside a team from the University of Technology Sydney led by Dr. David Suggett.

The initiative is called the Coral Nurture Program. Similar projects in the area were already in place, such as the Crown-of-Thorns (a coral destroying starfish) eradication and the Eye on Reef monitoring program.

But what makes this latest project unique is that it’s the first time tour companies have worked together with researchers.

The technique being used to restore the coral – using ‘coral clips’, is also a first.

Lorna Howlett, project coordinator and PhD student, explains how it works:

“It involves finding fragments of opportunity – coral fragments that have naturally broken off,” she said. “And attaching them back on to the reef using a coral clip. We can only use fragments of opportunity found at the site, so Passions of Paradise has installed six frames at the site which can be used as a nursery to grow more corals.”

Approximately 1000 pieces of coral have been planted on Hastings Reef so far.

The Great Barrier Reef is home to an incredibly diverse array of sea-life and was declared a World Heritage Area in 1981. Situated off the northeast coast of Australia, it stretches for around 2300km. It is the biggest coral reef system in the world, comprising around 2900 individual reefs and 900 islands.

A 2014 report by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority found that climate change and global heating is the biggest threat to the reef.

Polluted land water quality running into the sea, coastal development, fishing, ocean acidification and coral bleaching are other major issues.

According to a 2012 report, the Great Barrier Reef has lost half it’s coral since 1985.

In 2015, the Reef 2050 Plan came into place. This is a 35-year plan for the long-term management of pollution and climate change.

1208,"In recent years, the climate change impact on the concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has become a topic of notable concern. Changes in environmental conditions such as the increase of the average temperature, or the UV-B radiation, are likely to influence the fate and behavior of POPs, ultimately affecting human exposure. The state of the art of the impact of climate change on environmental concentrations of POPs, as well as on human health risks, is here reviewed. Research gaps are also identified, while future studies are suggested. Climate change and POPs are a hot issue, for which wide attention should be paid not only by scientists, but also and mainly by policy makers. Most studies reported in the scientific literature are focused on legacy POPs, mainly polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides. However, the number of investigations aimed at estimating the impact of climate change on the environmental levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is scarce, despite of the fact that exposure to PAHs and photodegradation byproducts may result in adverse health effects. Furthermore, no data on emerging POPs are currently available in the scientific literature. In consequence, an intensification of studies to identify and mitigate the indirect effects of the climate change on POP fate is needed to minimize the human health impact. Furthermore, being this a global problem, interactions between climate change and POPs must be addressed from an international perspective.",mainstream
110,"Zoomer can be used neutrally to refer to a member of Generation Z, especially when referring to large social trends.

But, zoomer is also very often used with an ironic, humorous, or even mocking tone, a lot of the times in reference to (or as pitted against) members of other generations. That’s because, on social media, referring to generations is frequently less about specific age groups and more about characteristics and attitudes of associated with social groups. Some people like to claim zoomers are addicted to social media and are too sensitive—along with other complaints that often target youth.

There are two notable zoomer memes. One is OK zoomer, which riffs on the viral OK boomer and is often used to call out or dismiss a young person in some way, often ironically.

The other zoomer originates as a young male character stereotyped for his online activity, music and gaming tastes, and dancing styles. It involves an edit of a so-called Wojak character with pointy, side-shaven hair and round glasses, often looking highly distressed. This zoomer is often portrayed as being upset by the things around him that don’t fit his tastes or perceptions.

Occasionally, zoomer has referred to a really zippy and energetic (zoom-y) boomer. This use appears to be fading, but it still exists in some older media from the 2000s, so be aware. Also be mindful that zoomer may be used in other contexts, too, from the name of a media company … to British slang for breasts.",mainstream
558,"The world is going green, from recycling and power generation to organic groceries and sustainable fisheries. Everyone, it seems—including climate change scientists, businesses, consumers and politicians—is interested in easing the burden humanity places on the environment.

If you are looking for ways to put a little green in your wallet by putting some green in your portfolio, you might be surprised at the wide range of available offerings. Here is a look at 11 top green investment areas.

Green energy is a hot topic in a world concerned about climate change. Power generation that doesn’t rely on the burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity for our homes or industries is creating a growing number of investment opportunities. Water, wind and solar are among the top sources of renewable energy.

One of the most important natural resources we have is water. There is considerable fear the world will run out of fresh water due to climate change. Cape Town, South Africa, was months away from running dry in 2018, until swift conservation measures helped to replenish supplies.﻿﻿

The European Environment Agency notes that some 20 European countries depend on other countries for more than 10% of their water resources. Five (the Netherlands, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, and Luxembourg) rely on rivers that flow in from other countries to provide more than 75% of their water.﻿﻿ In the United States, cities from Los Angeles to Miami are concerned about water scarcity as climate change takes a toll on water resources.﻿﻿

A portfolio of water investments might include companies that collect, purify and distribute water. The largest water utility company in the U.S. is American Water (AWK), which supplies drinking water to 14 million people.﻿﻿ Essential Utilities (WTRG) supplies water to nearly 3 million people.﻿﻿ And, sticking with our water theme, these utilities are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.

If picking individual stocks is too much hassle, mutual funds provide additional ways to invest. The Calvert Global Water Fund﻿﻿ and the AllianzGI Water Fund﻿﻿ tap into water-based opportunities across the globe.

Water has also been the go-to resource for renewable energy for centuries. The ancient Greeks ran grain mills on water power. Today, projects such as China's massive Three Gorges Dam can supply electricity to between 70 million and 80 million households. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), hydropower is the most cost-efficient means of generating electricity.﻿﻿

There are few pure-play stocks in the hydro business. However, there are three energy producers with notable amounts of hydropower in their portfolios. PG&E (PCG) has one of the largest hydro operations.﻿﻿ Idacorp (IDA) has 17 hydro projects.﻿﻿ Meanwhile, Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) derives 74% of its portfolio from hydropower.﻿﻿

Wind is one of the fastest-growing sources of renewable energy, having increased 75-fold over the past two decades.﻿﻿ China leads the world with 217 gigawatts of installed capacity in 2018, followed by the U.S. with 96 gigawatts and Germany with 59 gigawatts.﻿﻿

If this renewable interests you, look for wind farms that sell wind-generated energy, or consider companies that manufacture wind turbines. Here again, there are few pure-play stocks, but a few of the interesting wind stocks include:

Furthermore, the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF (FAN) provides a passive way to invest in wind energy.﻿﻿

Energy from the sun powers homes, buildings and a variety of other items from lights to radios. If you think the sun is just starting to rise in this industry, focus your attention on companies that make solar panels, which will benefit as homeowners and businesses increasingly adopt solar power. First Solar (FSLR) is a leading producer of solar modules and systems.﻿﻿ JinkoSolar Holding (JKS) also makes solar modules and claims to have delivered 52 gigawatts of production capacity.﻿﻿ Sunpower (SPWR) makes solar modules and storage solutions for homes and businesses.﻿﻿

Of course, there’s more to solar than panels. From components to installation, a wide variety of businesses present investment opportunities, including:

The reduction is the key term here. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions on industrial power plants to minimizing the emissions that come out of the tailpipe of your car, the pollution control industry is on the rise. This is the industry that responds every time legislation mandates an improvement in the amount of some harmful chemical that can be released into the environment. Companies and ETFs that focus on pollution control technologies include:

When it comes to transportation, Tesla (TSLA) is the first name on many people’s lists. While an attention-grabbing leader and exciting technology have kept this company in the news, it’s not the only game in town.

On a smaller scale, researchers are working with fuel-cell technology to develop an alternative method of powering automobiles. If this technology works, there are millions of cars—and millions of consumers—waiting for it.

Companies that operate in the space include Ballard Power Systems (BLDP), which produces cells that can be used in vehicles and back-up power systems.﻿﻿ Meanwhile, FuelCell Energy (FCEL) focuses on providing power options to commercial and industrial facilities.﻿﻿

Recycling has become a standard practice. Most people are aware that paper, metal and glass can be reprocessed and reused, but the things you didn't know you can recycle continues to grow. Waste oil, vegetable oil, batteries, cell phones, computers and even car parts can have a second life. Recycling these items involves a business enterprise humming along in the background.

In terms of your portfolio, waste management companies with a large base of recycling facilities may be of interest, including companies such as Republic Services﻿﻿ (RSG) and Waste Management﻿﻿ (WM). Covanta (CVA) takes a different approach, generating power by incinerating waste.﻿﻿

Organic farms eschew the use of pesticides, engage in sustainable farming practices and sell products that are often healthier to eat than the stuff composed of three-syllable words that you can't pronounce and a shelf-life measured in decades. They also engage in animal management practices that avoid the use of hormones and antibiotics, keeping those chemicals out of the food chain and out of the ground and water surrounding the farms. One of the biggest organic food companies is United Natural Foods (UNFI), a wholesale distributor of healthy food options.﻿﻿

Sustainable fishing is another food-related investment opportunity that is generating attention as the plight of the world’s overfished oceans impacts the human food chain. Mowi ASA (MNHVF), a Norwegian firm with global operations, is an interesting play in this space.﻿﻿

Geothermal energy uses heat from the earth to produce clean energy. Ormat Technologies (ORA) builds, owns and operates geothermal plants, with operations in the U.S., Guatemala, Guadeloupe, Honduras, Indonesia and Kenya.﻿﻿

For many companies, the urge to go green is a relatively recent phenomenon. As with change everywhere, some firms adapt and some don't. Investment managers in the green space have begun to categorize firms by the place they hold along the green spectrum.

Take oil companies, for example. One would be hard-pressed to think of these firms as green, and for the most part, they aren't. But if you take a closer look at their business models, it is easy to see that some are greener than others. In fact, several large oil companies are among the global leaders in promoting a tax on greenhouse gases and investing in energy sources that will help the world transition away from oil.﻿﻿ Choosing the firms with the best environmental records and practices is another way of looking at green investments.

If a green investment catches your eye, there are plenty of ways to find a place for it in your portfolio. You don't have to choose individual companies to get into the area. Mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, stocks, bonds and even money market funds that focus on the environment are all available.",mainstream
668,"Antarctica Breaks 69°F for the First Time on Record

The Antarctic region just recorded a temperature higher than 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time.

Brazilian scientists measured a temperature of 20.75 degrees Celsius (approximately 69.35 degrees Fahrenheit) on Seymour Island Feb. 9, one of the researchers told AFP Thursday.

The record was broken three days after the Antarctic continent recorded its highest temperature to date at a balmy 18.3 degrees Celsius (approximately 64.9 degrees Fahrenheit). That measure was taken at Argentina’s Esperanza station on the Antarctic peninsula that extends north towards South America.

The Brazilian reading was taken on one of the islands that extends off that peninsula, according to BBC News. It breaks the previous record for the entire Antarctic region, defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as all the land and ice south of 60 degrees. The previous record for the region of 19.8 degrees Celsius (approximately 67.6 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded in 1982 on Signy Island.

Schaefer was careful to point out that the temperature reading was not part of a larger study and so could not be used as evidence of a climate trend.

However, Antarctica as a whole has warmed by almost three degrees Celsius over the past 50 years, according to WMO data reported by BBC News. During that time, about 87 percent of the glaciers on its western coast have retreated. The region also just recorded its warmest January on record.

Schaefer works as part of Brazil’s Terrantar project that studies 23 sites in Antarctica. Temperatures on the peninsula, the South Shetland Islands and the James Ross archipelago cooled during the first decade of the 21st century, and then began to rise quickly, he told The Guardian.

The peninsula and its surrounding islands have been the areas of Antarctica most impacted by the climate crisis so far, which means they might indicate how the rest of the region will react.

If all of the ice in Antarctica were to melt, it would cause 50 to 60 meters (approximately 164 to 197 feet) of sea level rise. This would take centuries, however. In the nearer term, scientists predict 30 to 110 centimeters (approximately 12 to 43 inches) of sea level rise by 2100, depending on how successfully greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and how the ice reacts.",conspiracy
913,"Fresh off a climate strike that took hundreds of thousands of young people out of classrooms and into the streets globally, youth leaders have gathered at the United Nations to demand radical moves to fight climate change.

“We showed that we are united and that we, young people, are unstoppable,” said 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who started the climate strike movement with her lone protest in front of her country’s parliament about a year and a half ago.

More than 700 mostly young activists attended the first Youth Climate Summit, according to Luis Alfonso de Alba, the U.N. special climate summit envoy.

Friday’s strike across six continents and Saturday’s youth conference presage a full-on climate conference next week at the U.N. General Assembly, which has placed the issue of climate change at front and center as world leaders gather for the annual meeting.

Activists at Saturday’s gathering demanded money for a fund to help poorer nations adapt to a warming world and provide greener energy. They also insisted that the world should wean itself quickly from coal, oil and gas, linked to climate change.

“Stop the criminal contaminant behavior of big corporations,” said Argentine climate activist Bruno Rodriguez. “Enough is enough. We don’t want fossil fuels anymore.”

Jayathma Wickramanayake, the U.N. secretary-general’s youth envoy, called climate change “the defining issue of our time. Millions of young people all over the world are already being affected by it.”

During Thunberg’s short lifetime, for example, Earth has already warmed 0.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.34 degrees Celsius).

Fiji climate activist Komal Karishma Kumar said global warming is not just taking a toll on the planet but on her generation, especially people from vulnerable places like her Pacific island nation.

“Young people from different parts of the world are living in constant fear and climate anxiety, fearing the future, the uncertainty of a healthy life or a life for their children at all,” Kumar said.

She added: “I do not want our future generations to submerge with our sinking islands.”

After listening to Thunberg and other youth climate activists, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres credited young people with transforming him from a pessimist to an optimist in the fight against global warming.

Guterres said he sees “a change in momentum” going into Monday’s Climate Action Summit taking place ahead of the U.N. General Assembly gathering that starts Tuesday, telling the youths “you have started this movement.”

“I encourage you to keep your initiative. Keep your mobilization and more and more to hold my generation accountable,” Guterres said. “My generation has largely failed until now to preserve both justice in the world and to preserve the planet.”

Kumar told Guterres that “we will hold you accountable and if you do not, remember we will mobilize to vote you out.”

The youth activists brainstormed about what they could do to change the trajectory of an ever-warming planet and how they can help the world adapt. There was talk of hashtags, entrepreneurial ideas and climate art and poetry.

“Be that hummingbird that puts out the forest fire by fetching water with its small beak as all the other animals, including the elephant, told her it was impossible,” said Kenyan activist Wanjuhi Njoroge.",mainstream
225,"Sorcha Faal’s Books Available Now In English!

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Russian Subscribers

In my report I had detailed how an ever increasing number of continuing energy surges have begun hitting our planet, and to the disruption of our world’s weather cycles.

Conjointly with the disruptions of the world’s weather systems has been the unexplained lighting up of the winter night skies in the far Northern Arctic regions, and as summarized in an article that said in part, ""The entire horizon is raised like magic, like the hand of God is bringing it up.”

More ominous for the world’s human beings perhaps, is that what has been generally relegated to the earth’s Southern Hemispheric regions is now occurring in the Northern ones too.

The evidence for these increasing energy ‘blasts’ are increasingly being pointed towards a number of events that have occurred in the universe in years past, and to which we are now feeling their effects.

One of these events was the Supernova Blast (SN1987a) that occurred on , and as explained by Peter Garnavich of the University of Notre Dame, ""The real fireworks show is finally starting, and over the next 10 years things will get spectacular.” But, and as also contained in this information, the time line for the earth’s visibility of this event lies between the years of 1995-2015. Current events are suggesting however that these events are going to be occurring much sooner than 2010.

The fear evident in Western scientists regarding this event belongs to their theories about Supernovas, and that state that they are one of the most energetic explosive events known. “They occur at the end of a star's lifetime, when its nuclear fuel is exhausted and it is no longer supported by the release of nuclear energy. If the star is particularly massive, then its core will collapse and in so doing will release a huge amount of energy.”

In a particularly strange event surrounding SN1987a, American scientists ‘reworked’ existing theories about supernovas to show not what is necessarily true, but rather what they seemingly wanted to see. (Or more ominously to keep this knowledge hidden from others.) This ‘reworking’ though, still revealed the nervousness about this event by the American scientists, and as evidenced in the comment by Dr. Neil Gehrels of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center when he stated, ""The possibility for mass extinction is indeed real, yet the risk seems much lower than we have thought.""

This American reworking of these formulas to obtain the results they desired left out the continued ozone layer depletion over the Southern Hemispheric Pole, and which according to the currently ongoing 2004 British survey states, “The ozone layer over much of the Southern Hemisphere south of 50° remains around 10% below the long term normal.”

Where in past times ozone layer depletion was rightly ascribed to cosmic rays (gamma rays), Western scientists have with their reworked mathematics created a whole new methodology that blames these depletions on CFC’s (chlorofluorocarbons), and which even first term Russian school child would laugh about if this were not so serious an event.

Best stated about these events from a Western perspective though are these words from an unknown person, “Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not in favor of ANY strange laboratory-created substances polluting the air I have to breathe, and I wholeheartedly endorse the current campaign to rid the atmosphere of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the atoms being blamed for the so-called ""holes"" in the ozone layer. But just stop for a minute and think: If CFCs caused the so-called ""holes,"" why are they ONLY over the ? Are the polar explorers and scientists using too much spray-on deodorant and fly-killer?

Of course not. If CFCs had much to do at all with the so-called ""holes,"" then the ""holes"" would be over , or , or , or at least somewhere relative to these places where it could be shown that the air currents were causing the CFCs to accumulate. But they are not. The ""holes"" only occur in two places, over the North and , exactly in accordance with natural forces which create the bulk of ozone, and exactly in accordance with the theories and predictions of the scientists who discovered them in the first place.

Western science has a long history of contradicting itself, and this time is no exception, and as stated in this research paper contributed to by a number of American educational institutions shows, ""Long-term effects of gamma ray bursts would spread around the Earth and include ozone layer depletion, global cooling, acid rain and radionuclide production.""

So today as the world is awash in acid rain, the ozone layers at the Northern and Southern Hemispheric Poles are expanding, the Western scientists put before their ever growing uneducated citizens a scientific explanation that blames these events on CFCs and fossil fuels, when they know the science behind these assertions is totally false.

An independent American researcher, Ricardo L. Carezani, in his article titled, “SN 1987 A and the Neutrino” says it best in describing Western scientists’ penchant for making facts fit their absurd assertions; “Putting together all 7 facts, the *overwhelming* neutrino evidence is replaced by an overwhelming evidence of ""the pharaoh's science"" (i.e. nothing). For those of you not familiar with the pharaoh's science, you can perform it yourself with a table and ruler: measure an arbitrary number of table parts, use an arbitrary equation, and come up with PI. Anyone can do it! Really!!”

Coming literally on the heels of this Supernova event was the most astronomically significant event of human history with the most powerful explosion in the universe since the Big Bang that occurred in December, 1997. “Astronomers are mystified by the most powerful explosion ever witnessed, an enormous burst of gamma ray energy 12 billion light years from Earth that in one second released almost as much energy as all the stars of the universe.”; and as stated in this article by the American news source CNN.

NASA Headquarters at the Goddard Space Flight Center further added about this event: “A recently detected cosmic gamma ray burst released a hundred times more energy than previously theorized, making it the most powerful explosion since the creation of the universe in the Big Bang.” For about one or two seconds, this burst was as luminous as all the rest of the entire universe,"" said Caltech professor George Djorgovski, one of the two principal investigators on the team from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.

Aside from the majority of Western peoples being ignorant of these events, Western scientists, at least publicly, are still not acknowledging the significance of them for all of the world’s peoples. Even with hundreds of thousands lying dead in there can be no expectation that Western peoples will either become knowledgeable about or heed these many universal warnings.

As incredible as it may seem to us Russians, Western people, (and especially the Americans) these Social Darwinist thinking human beings, fail to even see the connection between the last American space shuttle disaster, the present lighting of the Arctic Regions of the Northern Hemisphere and continuing global weather chaos! They even have State ordered training of their children through their educational systems that indoctrinate them into this way of being! The parents and grandparents of these children even willingly hand over their children to these mass indoctrination centers, and with their knowing the destructiveness of these institutions from the very examples our own Russian history has shown them.

The Western media did report that, “Upper atmosphere may hold clues in mystery” in an article that appeared in an American national publication, USA Today. This article states in part, “The space shuttle Columbia's troubles began as it dropped like a meteor from orbit into a mysterious and poorly understood atmospheric region that scientists have dubbed the ""ignorosphere”. The Concorde, the supersonic jet, flies in the bottom of this region at more than 11 miles above the Earth's surface.

Nothing but a rocket can fly at its upper limit of 53 miles. The ""ignorosphere"" encompasses the mesosphere and upper stratosphere. Invisible clouds, strange electrical flashes called red sprites and blue lightning bolts that strike upward from the tops of clouds inhabit the thin air. This is the place where falling stars are made. The ""ignorosphere"" earns its nickname from the fact that you can't get there from here without a rocket. It is too high for weather balloons and too low for satellites to dip down to gather information.

The connection to these seemingly disconnected events is the rare earth phenomena called Noctilucent Clouds.

What are Noctilucent Clouds? “NLC were first discovered in the summer of 1884 after the eruption of Krakatoa which occurred in 1883. The volcanic eruption was at first thought to have contributed to the formation of NLC due to the ejection of huge quantities of dust into the upper atmosphere; however it has been proven that the eruption was not responsible for their formation.”

The actual ""discoverer"" is debated, however recent work has shown that the first conclusive observations were performed by T.W. Backhouse from Sunderland, U.K. Gadsden and Schroder (1989) question why Noctilucent Clouds were not discovered prior to 1885 and suggest that the eruption of Krakatoa was significant in that it caused observers to take more of a careful note of the twilight skies. This is a very difficult hypothesis to comprehend as it suggests that no observers ever bothered to take note of the twilight sky. This is a highly unlikely scenario as it is would seem very improbable that astronomers and meteorologists who frequently observed would miss such a highly conspicuous phenomena.

Of such concern are these phenomenal Noctilucent Clouds that a number of Western scientific studies are underway in the search for the answers as to why they are increasing, and to the extent that light from them is being reflected back into the normally darkened winter skies. “Increased sightings of noctilucent clouds may be related to climate change.” states one of these research studies underway by an organization named CAWSES (Climate and Weather of the Sun-Earth System), and as stated in their report titled: A proposed new SCOSTEP Program for 2004-2008.

Another study being conducted is by the HAIL Project (Holographic Array for Ionospheric Lightning), associated with the American Stanford University, where their approach is being directed towards, “Direct electrodynamic coupling between lightning discharges and the mesosphere/lower ionosphere evidenced by spectacular luminous optical emissions known as red sprites and elves, VLF signatures of rapid conductivity changes and radar detection of transient ionization patches above a thunderstorms.”

Specifically, these increasing cosmic ray bursts hitting our planet are causing, among other things, an ever increasing amount of upper atmosphere lighting occurrences that are also disturbing our earth’s magnetic field and causing such bad things to happen as small planes falling out of the sky due to disruptions in our magnetic field.

These are best known to aircraft pilots as gravity, or buoyancy waves. “Gravity, or buoyancy waves, are pressure waves generated by disturbances within the atmosphere, where the restoring forces (potential energy) for the wave motion is provided by buoyancy and gravity, rather than compression/expansion as in higher frequency acoustic waves.”

Coinciding with all of these events have been the Americans associating them with their older people’s knowledge (to them myths and legends) and warnings of not only these events, but the future events to come.

Such an example is the association of the 1987 Supernova (SN1987a) with a deliberately planted falsehood of it being the ‘Blue Star’ much talked about in the Hopi American Indian legend. The problem is that the much reported on Hopi ‘Blue Star’, and its significance, is a lie. This is able to be so because the ‘power’ involved with Social Darwinism is that it subverts in the human being their ability to find truths within themselves and surrenders it to the mass propaganda of the State. Like the National Socialistic System (Nazi) of during the Great Patriotic War (World War II) the individuals not in step with the masses are cast outside their social folds.

For this particular example we can see that the beginnings of these rumors that the Hopi peoples had in their older people’s stories a Blue Star began not with the Hopi peoples but with two Western people, Thomas E. Mails, in his book titled “The Hopi Survival Kit” and Moira Timms with her book titled “Beyond Prophecies and Predictions”.

""I am nobody. I am not a shaman, a medicine man, a guru, a channeler, or a psychic. I am not an ex-intelligence officer from the CIA, the NSA, the secret services or any other branch of any service. I am not the reincarnation of an ancient being, an ancient deity or a heavenly visitor. I have nothing to offer you in the way of credibility. I am a nobody... and I like it that way.""

 

 ---Robert Morning Sky, introducing himself in an article called, ""The Blue Star Hoax"" that appeared in LEADING EDGE #95. Among other things, Morning Sky, a Hopi, claimed that the fabled ""Blue Star"" does not exist in Hopi legends, teachings or mythology. It was a term that he invented in the early 1970's that has since been pirated by researchers who falsely claimed to have spent time with Hopi Elders learning the secrets of the Blue Star Kachina (a kachina that Morning Sky says doesn't exist), and channelers, psychics and clairvoyants who claim to have received Blue Star revelations from their spiritual sources.

As we know in about the older people of the earth, it is also possible that their trickster nature has been at play here when it comes to their interactions with the Western peoples of the world. Such exactly are the people of the Kachina Cult, and who the Western people call the Hopi. The Western people’s ‘everything’ is separate, nothing is ‘connected’ world view contributes to their beliefs that ‘their’ older peoples are disassociated with the other older peoples of the world, and therefore gives them no understanding that all of the earths older peoples are the same in thought and spirit about all things.

The mythical lies and State organized propaganda facing the Western people’s however keep them locked away from the incredible mysteries surround these events I’ve presented here before you today.

In my last letter to my American subscribers, and to which I’ve also shared with all of you, titled “Now Visible Comet Heralds Warning of Doom to World” I wrote about the significance of this new ‘Green Comet’ and it’s historical meaning to us living in these years of great tribulation and coming cataclysms, if only we listen to the earths older peoples and the universe itself and learn their songs.

In the ‘choices of the threes’ that human beings are always presented with, we have been shown from these past weeks events that the earths older peoples still know the songs and did not perish in this latest cataclysm: “Elders' Sea Knowledge Spares Some Thais”. We also have the examples of the earth’s animals knowing these songs too: ‘Tsunami Adds to Belief in Animals' 'Sixth Sense' And we also have from another of the earth’s older peoples, that our dreams hold these songs too, if we but listen to them: “His wife dreamed of floods, he built on stilts, and they survived Tsunami”.

The ancient examples of the warnings of ‘oneness’ show to us all also that there is no insignificant event that for the greater warning of all human beings will be made known to all, and these are three.

For many years now the Universe has been singing its song of warning to all human beings.

From the Southern Hemispheric Regions, and where one looks into the great Magellanic Cloud, the older peoples of they call the Aborigines “Slept and dreamt under the stars. They took the night stars for granted. They embraced the darkness. It is woven into their culture through song, dance, ritual, art and myth.”

The Greater Clouds of Magellan is a nebula located about 200,000 light years away and can be viewed with the naked eye. It appears to be like a slightly blurred cloud. In addition, the Tarantula Nebula, said to be the most beautiful sight in the skies (it resembles a spider), runs over the Greater Clouds of Magellan, so it is a constellation with plenty of sights.” It is written here.

It also carries the name of The Swordfish, and which I had previously written to you about. In a book titled “Our Rock Who Art In Heaven, Hallowed Be Thy Name”, written by Jacqueline Brook, it is written: “The comet [or literally, ""swordfish""] associated with Hermes shines bright green with an oval shape...”

On “…the brightest supernova in four centuries lit up the southern sky…” and began singing a song to the earth’s human beings.

If you are you’ll know that the lies being told by the scientists from the nations of the West are those born out of fear. Their fear comes from a knowing that the materialistic world that they have spent thousands of years building, and in defiance of the stewardship of this earth and its people’s safekeeping they were entrusted with, is soon to be no more.

While the great and terrible armies of the world and the vast and mysterious powers of the universe gather for battle, the peoples of the Western Nations remain asleep and in ignorance of their soon to come deaths. In this world today the Western peoples are truly lost, soulless and faceless, not knowing any of the events about to befall them.

From this slumber of theirs, we, and many others of our kind, have pledged ourselves to save as many as can be saved, not from the death of their human lives, but the death of their very souls.

1008,"One of the Top Priorities of the Trump Administration

On February 9, 2017, one of President Donald Trump’s first executive orders was enacted called Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking. Its purpose is to strictly crack down on human trafficking, especially child trafficking both foreign and domestic.

In an article published on Zero Hedge on August 1, 2017, we can clearly see how cracking down on human trafficking and pedophilia is one of the top priorities of the Trump administration, presumably because he is aware that it leads straight to the top of politics and world power.

Upon taking office, President Trump made the fight against human trafficking and pedophilia a top priority for his administration – kicked off by a human trafficking awareness ad released in early February by the Department of Homeland Security (headed by… General Kelly, 67). That was only the beginning. Five days later on February 9, Trump signed an Executive Order to combat human trafficking (“Presidential Executive Order on Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking”). Then in late February, Trump told a room of advisors and representatives from anti-trafficking organizations that he vowed to fight the ‘epidemic’ of human trafficking, promising to bring the ‘full force and weight‘ of the U.S. government to address the problem. Of note, a record 1500+ arrests of pedophiles or sex traffickers were made during Trump’s first month in office…",conspiracy
905,"Humans need to adapt to the impacts of climate change, for instance through technological solutions such as coastal defences and changes in consumption habits. Humans are already adapting to climate change, and further adaptation efforts will be necessary during coming decades. However, adaptation alone is not expected to be able to cope will all projected effects since the options diminish and the costs increase with rising temperatures.

Vulnerability of human populations to climate change and its consequences can be affected by other factors, such as pollution, conflicts, or epidemics such as AIDS. An emphasis on sustainable development can help human societies reduce their vulnerability to climate change. However, climate change itself can become an impediment to their development.

Mitigation measures that aim to reduce greenhouse gases emissions can help avoid, reduce or delay impacts, and should be implemented in order to ensure that adaptation capacity is not exceeded.",mainstream
427,"Climate change activists from Greenpeace protest outside the EU Council headquarters, ahead of an EU leaders summit in Brussels, Belgium December 12, 2019.

European Union leaders agreed on Friday to a 2050 climate neutrality target for the bloc, after hours of haggling with Eastern European states demanding funds to support a transition away from fossil fuels and a role for nuclear power.

But they left Poland out of the commitment for now, agreeing to return to the issue next June, and also left the door open for the Czech Republic include nuclear in its future energy mix.

Diplomats said the summiteers' final decision - reached 10 hours after they had gathered - said ""one member state"", meaning Poland, could not commit to the 2050 target. They said that Poland had earlier floated the idea of setting the date at 2070.

The decision came just a day after the bloc's new executive unveiled a 100-billion-euro ($110 billion) plan for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century, declaring it the EU's ""man on the moon moment"".

""Agreement on climate neutrality by 2050 ... (the European Council) reaches a deal on this important goal,"" tweeted Council President Charles Michel, who chaired a fraught summit meeting of 27 leaders in Brussels. ""Nothing worth having comes easy ... But we did it!""

The two-day summit is the first since Germany's Ursula von der Leyen took office as the new head of the European Commission, and a failure to agree on the climate neutrality deal, her biggest initiative, would have been a setback for the new leadership.

Underlining the stakes, Greenpeace climate activists had earlier in the day scaled the glass-fronted Europa building where leaders meet, unfurling banners reading ""Climate Emergency"", firing off red flares and blaring fire alarm sirens.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban set the tone ahead of the talks, insisting that less affluent countries of eastern Europe must get generous and precise financial guarantees for their transition away from fossil fuels.

""We cannot allow Brussels bureaucrats to have poor people and poor countries to pay the costs of the fight against climate change,"" Orban said.

However, the main holdouts were the Czechs and Poles.

Prague's demand that it should be able to use EU money to build nuclear power plants on its soil ran into opposition from Austria, Germany and Luxembourg. Meanwhile Poland wanted firm guarantees that EU climate investment would not crowd out the bloc's development aid for its poorer peers.

""It is important to have certainty that nobody will stop us in the construction of nuclear power units,"" Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis told reporters. ""We have to have electricity for people, for firms, and heating.""

The Czech Republic generates about half of its electricity from coal and wants to phase most of it out over the next 20 years, replacing part of it with new nuclear power plants.

Hungary relies on nuclear power for about a third of its energy needs, with coal making up less than 15% of its energy mix. It wants to abolish coal by 2030 and replace it with a mix of nuclear, gas, renewables and energy imports.

In Poland some 80% of power is generated from coal and discussions about introducing nuclear energy have not yet been settled, partly due to high costs.

The climate discussion feeds into another tricky debate, over the bloc's next long-term budget for 2021-27, on which no agreement was reached during a brief summit discussion that pitted a frugal camp against those seeking a heavier outlay.

""Some people want to pay less, some people want to get more, others to do new things,"" said Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel.

""I wasn't the best at mathematics but this, I think, is not going to add up.""",mainstream
416,"Ministers are bracing themselves for a powerful new rebuke from the government’s own advisers over the nation’s inadequate response to the climate crisis. In its annual progress report, to be published on Thursday, the Committee on Climate Change will lambast continuing failures by the government to tackle the issues of overheating homes, flash floods, loss of biodiversity and the other threats posed as our planet continues to overheat dangerously.

Last year, the committee complained that no areas of the UK’s response to the climate crisis were being tackled properly. “The whole thing is run by the government like a Dad’s Army,” said the committee’s chairman, Lord Deben.

And this year’s report will bring no happier news for ministers. Instead, the committee will highlight the fact that virtually no progress has been made over the past year to tackle the misery that will be brought by climate change. And although global carbon emissions have decreased during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, many scientists warn that any benefits for the climate are likely to be temporary.

As a result, the committee is expected to make a number of key proposals to try to get Britain back on track and moving towards its commitment to bring all greenhouse gas emissions in the UK to net zero by 2050. It will recommend:
• None Enforcing strict environmental conditions to any corporate bailouts made during the pandemic crisis, in line with standards imposed in France, Germany and Canada
• None Making major improvements in broadband provision and cycling routes to ensure the nation avoids a surge in car use as people return to work while trying to avoid using buses and trains
• None Consideration of a new tax on fossil fuels
• None Introducing new policies on energy efficiency in buildings, planting more trees, and protecting peatland

The need to take action over climate change has become increasingly urgent, scientists have warned over the past few weeks. Despite the recent dip in carbon emissions, last month was the warmest May on record, according to Nasa, and scientists say 2020 could be the warmest year on record.

Siberia is now sweltering in a heatwave and its permafrost is in danger of melting, releasing plumes of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. And in the Antarctic, researchers have reported the spread of algal blooms triggered by rising temperatures.

No part of the globe is going to escape the crisis, researchers insist, and the UK must be prepared to tackle the inevitable threats of rising sea levels, coast erosion, flooding, heatwaves and epidemics of diseases, such as malaria. At the same time, it needs to rapidly curtail its reliance on fossil fuels to meet global emission pledges.

“The UK is due to host the critical United Nations climate change summit next year, but its credibility as a climate leader is now under threat,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change. “Successive committee reports have warned we are not on course to meet our carbon budgets which set future emissions targets. The government needs to use the economic recovery packages from Covid-19 to put us back on track.”

Petrol and diesel vehicles need to be phased out, moves begun to eliminate gas central heating, and work started on adapting homes and workplaces against flooding and heatwaves. “These will all require massive investments, but they will also create new jobs and economic growth,” added Ward.",mainstream
155,"Greta Thunberg is the Swedish teenager who skipped school and inspired an international movement to fight climate change.

She has become a leading voice, inspiring millions to join protests around the world. On Friday, she addressed students in Bristol.

But who is she and what does she want?

She is a 17-year-old who grew up in Stockholm, in Sweden. Greta's mother, Malena Ernman, is an opera singer and former Eurovision Song Contest participant.

Her father Svante Thunberg, is an actor, and is a descendant of Svante Arrhenius, a scientist who came up with a model of the greenhouse effect. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903.

The elder of two girls, she says she learned about climate change when she was eight, but that her parents were not climate activists.

Greta has Asperger's syndrome, a developmental disorder, and has described it as a gift and said being different is a ""superpower"".

When did she start campaigning?

In May 2018, aged 15, Greta won a climate change essay competition in a local newspaper.

Three months later, in August, she started protesting in front of the Swedish parliament building, vowing to continue until the Swedish government met the carbon emissions target agreed by world leaders in Paris, in 2015.

She held a sign that read ""School Strike for Climate"" and began regularly missing lessons to go on strike on Fridays, urging students around the world to join her.

Her protests went viral on social media and as support for her cause grew, other strikes started around the world, spreading with the hashtag #FridaysForFuture.

By December 2018, more than 20,000 students around the world had joined her in countries including Australia, the UK, Belgium, the US and Japan. She joined strikes around Europe, choosing to travel by train to limit her impact on the environment.

What has she done since then?

The teenager took the whole of 2019 off school to continue campaigning, to attend key climate conferences, and to join student protests around the world.

In September 2019, she travelled to New York to address a UN climate conference. Greta refuses to fly because of its environmental impact, so she made her way there on a racing yacht, in a journey that lasted two weeks.

When she arrived, millions of people around the world took part in a climate strike, underlining the scale of her influence. Addressing the conference, she blasted politicians for relying on young people for answers to climate change.

She said: ""How dare you? I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?""

She was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year.
• 'You have stolen my dreams and my childhood'
• Greta: 'Sorry, you're not trying hard enough'

What does she want?

Greta says big governments and businesses around the world are not moving quickly enough to cut carbon emissions and has attacked world leaders for failing young people.

Initially, her protests focused on the Swedish government's climate targets, and she urged students around the world to make similar demands in their own countries.

But as her fame has grown, she has called for governments around the world to do more to cut global emissions. She has spoken at international meetings, including the UN's 2019 climate change gathering in New York, and this year's World Economic Forum in Davos.

At the forum, she called for banks, firms and governments to stop investing and subsidising fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas. ""Instead, they should invest their money in existing sustainable technologies, research and in restoring nature,"" she said.
• Greta named Time Person of the Year for 2019
• 'She is happy, but I worry' - Greta Thunberg's father

What do people say about her?

Millions of students around the world have been inspired by her strikes, and Greta has received support from climate activists, scientists, world leaders and the Pope, who told her to ""continue"" her work.

Broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough told her she had achieved things many others have failed to do, adding: ""you have aroused the world. I'm very grateful to you.""

But her message has not been well received by everyone. After her UN appearance in September 2019, US President Donald Trump appeared to mock her by saying she ""must work on her anger management problem"".

Greta then changed her Twitter biography to include Mr Trump's words. She did the same weeks later when Russian President Vladimir Putin called her a ""kind but poorly informed teenager"". In January, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the teenager to go away and study economics before lecturing investors.

1158,"The past decade has been the hottest on record, the UN said Wednesday, warning that the higher temperatures were expected to fuel numerous extreme weather events in 2020 and beyond.

The World Meteorological Organization, which based its findings on analysis of leading international datasets, said increases in global temperatures had already had dire consequences, pointing to ""retreating ice, record sea levels, increasing ocean heat and acidification, and extreme weather"".

WMO said its research also confirmed data released by the European Union's climate monitor last week showing that 2019 was the second hottest on record, after 2016.

""The year 2020 has started out where 2019 left off -- with high-impact weather and climate-related events,"" WMO chief Petteri Taalas said in a statement, pointing in particular to the devastating bushfires that have been raging in Australia for months.

The bushfires, unprecedented in their duration and intensity, have claimed 28 lives and highlighted the type of disasters that scientists say the world will increasingly face due to global warming.

The fires have already destroyed more than 2,000 homes and burnt 10 million hectares (100,000 square kilometres) of land -- an area larger than South Korea or Portugal.

""Unfortunately, we expect to see much extreme weather throughout 2020 and the coming decades, fuelled by record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,"" Taalas said.

The UN agency said that average global temperatures during both the past five-year (2015-2019) and 10-year (2010-2019) periods were the highest ever recorded.

""Since the 1980s each decade has been warmer than the previous one,"" the UN agency said in a statement, warning that ""this trend is expected to continue"".

The United Nations said last year that man-made greenhouse gas emissions needed to tumble 7.6 percent each year to 2030 in order to limit temperature rises to 1.5C -- the more ambitious cap nations signed up to in the landmark Paris climate deal.

Current pledges to cut emissions put Earth on a path of several degrees warming by the end of the century.

Taalas on Wednesday said that since modern records began in 1850, the average global temperature had risen by around 1.1 degrees Celsius, and warned of significant warming in the future.

""On the current path of carbon dioxide emissions, we are heading towards a temperature increase of three to five degrees Celsius by the end of the century,"" he warned.

WMO also highlighted a new study published this week in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences with data showing that ocean heat content was at a record high in 2019.

The past five years, and past decade were also the warmest on record in terms of ocean heat content, that study showed.

Since more than 90 percent of excess heat is stored within the world's oceans, their heat content is a good way to quantify the rate of global warming, WMO said.

Conservationists said the UN agency's findings were to be expected.

""It is no surprise that 2019 was the second hottest year on record -- nature has been persistently reminding us that we have to pick up the pace,"" said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, leader of WWF's global climate and energy practice, calling for dramatic measures to halt the warming trend.

Scientists also stressed the need for urgent action.

""If we look at all the impacts around the world that are now occurring as a result of this warming, it is obvious that we are not succeeding in preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system,"" said Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science.",mainstream

The comedian now brings his curiosity and humor to the second season of Years of Living Dangerously, a National Geographic Channel series on the impacts of—and solutions to—climate change. For the show he traveled to India, population 1.3 billion, to learn about the world’s energy future.

Well, for years I thought I didn’t want to influence people on matters of conscience. I’m not that smart. But then a few years ago someone uttered what has become the cliché in regard to climate change, and that is: What will we tell our children when they say, “Why didn’t you do anything about this?” I bought that—hook, line, and sinker. That’s the headline for me to start paying attention and start, in small ways, to do something. People are being displaced. People’s ways of life are changing. The questions of adaptability are enormous.

You went to report in India. What was that like?

Everything surprised me. It was jaw-dropping. I look at 1.3 billion people and say, “Well, that’s the problem”—and they look at it as the solution. It’s a population that’s quite young, and they see that as a huge resource. Honestly I’ve never seen poverty like [I saw there]. I saw people living in thatched huts and mud homes, breathing coal and kerosene fumes. Because I’ve been lucky in my life, I’ve come to this observation—and I’m embarrassed to say this—late in my life. I feel like these people did me a tremendous favor.

First of all, when you talk about me, you have to put “comedy” in air quotes. It’s difficult to be funny when you’re sitting on the floor of a mud hut. But talking to kids on the floor of a mud hut is the same as talking to kids in tiny chairs in a kindergarten. They’re kids, they giggle, they have funny things to say, even through a translator. Regardless of the surroundings and their condition, I felt really comfortable talking to these kids, because there’s nothing more fun than goofing with kids. That’s something universal.",mainstream

And one professor from Texas has had enough – he’s decided to offer £17,500 ($30,000) to anyone that can prove to him that climate change is not man-made.

Dr Christopher Keating, who previously taught at the University of South Dakota, says the climate change deniers of today are engaged in a campaign that is similar to the one waged by tobacco advocates to deny a link between smoking and lung cancer.

Previously he had been offering £5,850 ($10,000) to the first person to prove climate changing wasn’t man-made but he has since upped the reward to £17,500 ($30,000).

All someone needs to do is show him evidence that unequivocally proves he is wrong on his blog. The challenge is open to anyone over 18 and there is no entry fee.

144,"The UK must avoid lurching from the coronavirus crisis into a deeper climate crisis, the government’s advisers have warned.

They recommend that ministers ensure funds earmarked for a post-Covid-19 economic recovery go to firms that will reduce carbon emissions.

They say the public should work from home if possible; and to walk or cycle.

And investment should prioritise broadband over road-building, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says.

People should also be encouraged to save emissions by continuing to consult GPs online.

The government will reply later, although the Energy Secretary Alok Sharma has already spoken in favour of a green recovery to the recession.

In a letter to the Prime Minister, the committee says jobless people should be re-trained for work in geographically-spread labour-intensive “green” industries such as home insulation; tree-planting; and peatland restoration.

It makes a veiled reference to the current discussions over a potential government bailout to save jobs in aviation, which is struggling in the crisis.

The letter says: “Many sectors of the UK economy do not currently bear the full costs of emitting greenhouse gases. Revenue could be raised by setting or raising carbon prices for these sectors.”

Green groups say any bailout should include a condition that the industry shrinks until it finds a technological solution to its carbon emissions.

The letter also tackles broader social themes of fairness and risk.

It says the Covid-19 crisis has highlighted inequalities, with poorer people more in danger.

The committee notes: “The response to the pandemic has disproportionately affected the same lower-income groups and younger people - who face the largest long-term impacts of climate change.

“The benefits of acting on climate change must be shared widely, and the costs must not burden those who are least able to pay or whose livelihoods are most at risk as the economy changes.

“It is important that the lost or threatened jobs of today should be replaced by those created by the new, resilient economy.”

The CCC Chairman, Lord Deben, said: “The Covid-19 crisis has shown the importance of planning well for the risks the country faces.

“Recovery means investing in new jobs, cleaner air and improved health. The actions needed to tackle climate change are central to rebuilding our economy.

“The government must prioritise actions that reduce climate risks and avoid measures that lock-in higher emissions.”

596,"There's sort of three big things.

The first is speed. I think we had long thought that climate change was happening very slowly, that it was unfolding, at fastest, at about a decade timescale, more usually like centuries, and we didn't have to worry about it in our own lives, maybe even our children's lives, but it was something to worry about for our grandchildren.

More than half of all the emissions that we have put into the atmosphere in the entire history of humanity, we have done in the last 30 years. And that means that we're doing this damage in real time and in the space of a generation. So the speed is really overwhelming.

And if we lived off the coasts, we often thought that it was a matter of sea level rise, and we'd be safe. We could live inland, that would be OK. In fact, it's an all-encompassing threat that's not compartmentalizable to the coast. It's much bigger than sea level rise.

It impacts the economy, which could be 30 percent lower than it would be without climate change by the end of the century, and it impacts public health, conflict. We could have twice as much war because of climate change at the end of the century. That's the second thing, the scope.

And then the severity. Most scientists talked about two degrees as the sort of threshold of catastrophe.",mainstream
333,"What does Anthropocene mean?

The Anthropocene, or Anthropocene Epoch, is a proposed name for the geological epoch that we’re currently living in. The name is intended to indicate that human actions have had a significant and lasting impact on the environment since the Industrial Revolution.

Anthropocene is proposed as the name of the epoch that would succeed the official current epoch, the Holocene. Anthropocene has not been adopted by scientific consensus, but the term is frequently used in both scientific and popular contexts, especially when discussing climate change.

Example: No discussion about the Anthropocene is complete without examining the role of fossil fuels in changes to our climate and ecosystems.",mainstream
283,"“The widespread obsession with Global-Warming-Climate-Change, in opposition to all factual evidence, is quite incredible.” — Dr David Kear

Dr David Kear is a former Director General of New Zealand’s Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) – as such he would have been considered one of New Zealand’s top scientists. He has been publishing on sea levels since the 1950s.

In 2013 Dr Kear prepared a booklet in which he set out his views on the globalist climate project. In the booklet, Dr Kear describes:
• his experience with the UN’s International Panel on Climate Change
• the corrupted science behind the Global Warming narrative
• the corrupted science behind the claims of rising sea-levels
• the demonisation by “Global Warmers” of the “essential and innocent gas, carbon dioxide”
• how councils are making zoning & other decisions purely to satisfy a false narrative, with total disregard for the facts

Dr Kear describes how local councils are ignoring scientific fact in order to satisfy an agenda imposed on them from above. No matter if scientists, engineers and local observers all indicate that the sea is not rising, even retreating – once a council has decided on a policy that assumes that the sea IS rising, the council is immovable, and makes decisions on zoning and building codes on that basis.

Such policies will be being applied in coastal and non-coastal areas alike, thereby contributing to fulfillment of Agenda 21 goals of eventually eliminating small towns and villages and moving people to “sustainable” megacities.

Dr Kear’s text is reproduced here in its entirety with minimal changes to format.

 THREAT TO US ALL,

 including to our GRANDCHILDREN]

“Climate Change” has become an important international topic – one might almost say religion. It began life as “Global Warming”.

So very many people, including politicians and “news people”, appear to have been overwhelmed by it, and have led others to believe, and follow the doctrine.

It has sponsored a good deal of international co-operation, which can only have been good.

However, the cost of “Combating Carbon” has been extremely high, and the debt and economic consequences are being passed on to present citizens, and, worse still, to future generations, including all our grandchildren.

This booklet attempts to raise, in citizens’ minds, questions regarding the enormous sums of money and effort being wasted on this topic.

Is it soundly based? Will it “do good” or “do bad” for ordinary citizens? Do those promoting it deserve our attention?

This booklet suggests that Global-Warming-alias-Climate-Change, as proposed by “Global Warmers” makes no sense. You, as the reader, must judge that for yourself – not to help the writer of this booklet, but to help you and your family.

Do you think after reading all this that the proponents are absolutely reliable?

Should you add your voice to those against it, or at least talk to your councillors and members of parliament and see how they feel?

Our Earth’s climate is highly variable, and records show clearly that it always has been so. Animals and plants have had no option but to accept what comes, and to adapt life in ways that suit best. Evolution gave some help by introducing “the Survival of the Fittest”

Humans found early that their discussion and understanding were helped by a belief in some extraneous source being the cause of recorded changes of climate – perhaps with divine power. This booklet uses “Mother Nature” in that role to avoid wordy explanations.

Humans discovered that they could ameliorate climatic effects with buildings, clothing and the rest, and even create “microclimates” through windbreaks, forest clearing, artificial lakes, fossil fuel burning, and the rest.

However, no-one originally thought seriously that man could change the basic influences to our climate – our Sun, our Earth’s rotation, the total quantity of our Planet’s water, and the rest. Mother Nature is able to change all such things (and has been doing so for some 3,000,000,000 years), but we are not.

THE NEW BELIEF – THE NEW PROBLEM

That ancient and acceptable view was amended in the minds of some people whom I call the “Global Warmers”. I’ve heard nothing convincing about their so-called “Science”; but what they publish convinces me that it’s close to nonsense. The most convincing evidence against it comes mostly from the Global Warmers themselves.

In this booklet, the beliefs of “Global Warming”, and “Climate Change” have initial capital letters. That contrasts with natural warming, or natural changing of climate – indicated by lower case initial letters. The idea of a human cause is much less than 300 years old.

My interest in our changing climate and sea level

During fieldwork for a PhD thesis I found a coastal exposure of soft sandstone at Ohuka Creek, south of Port Waikato. There were Pliocene fossils of marine shellfish below an extensive horizontal bedding plane. Above that plane were more fossils, but of cool-lovinga plants.

A finger could show the exact location of the abrupt change to the cooler climate at the onset of the first of the world-wide Pleistocene glaciations [Ice Ages]. Ice formed widely at the ultimate expense of sea water, so sea level fell. At Ohuka, sea bed had become land.

Such changes are rarely seen in a continuous sequence, so I recorded it in a 1957 scientific paperb. That resulted in my joining an informal world-wide Group researching changing sea levels.

Most interest then was about the rate of sea level rise as the Earth warmed following the “Little Ice Age”. That cool period, from about 1500 to 1700 AD, halted winemaking in England and taro cropping in New Zealand.

Our Group determined the rate of sea level rise in many different World regions, from widely-available readings of tide gauges (less variable than those of thermometers). The average for us all was 125 mm/century (“125” here). Hence it would take 8 centuries for sea level to rise 1m – no serious threat to us.

Subsequently, I attended many international science conferences representing DSIR, NZ or Pacific Nations. I noted the words “Global Warming” appearing increasingly in paper titles, and sensed a growing number of adherents.

Those latter arranged a first-ever “Conference on Global Warming” in Vienna in 1985. Unlike most such meetings, where a communiqué summarising achievements was released on the final day, the full results of this one were delayed for over 2 years.

When they did appear (front page NZ Herald, two days before Christmas 1987) a World Declaration included “Overseas scientists have estimated that the seas around New Zealand will rise by up to 1.4 m in the next 40 years”. That article concentrated on the massive consequent problems, caused by our carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, but gave no adequate supporting science.

That rate of rise was equivalent to 3,500 mm/century, 28 times faster than our 125. Hence we stupidly ignored it, thinking noone could possibly believe it. But the World did believe, and the Global Warming mirage was born. Had 3,500 been true, sea level should have risen by almost 1 m by today – it hasn’t, not even closely.

This showed unambiguously that those “Overseas Scientists” were not true scientists. They ignored a most important basic rule of true science “Thou shall not publish Science without first checking it. A check against local tide gauges would have shown how wrong 1.4 m in 40 yrs was; they simply hadn’t bothered to check. That was a First Grave Error.

Australian government scientists were concerned about the effects on Pacific Island nations by any sea level rise of around 3,500 mm/century, and launched a project to determine the correct figure at that time. They announced the result at the 1992 meeting of SOPAC – a geoscientific organisation of South Pacific nations. Their figure was 122 mm/century, confirming the order of magnitude of our group’s 125 average value.

The Global Warmers persisted with their use of pseudo-science and made further predictions. Understandably they too all proved wrong. At conferences I began to hear, regardless of the science involved, when a speaker wished to “rubbish” some scientific idea or research, he/she stated that conclusion firmly, and followed it by “Just like Global Warming”.

Clearly the Global Warmers heard that too. They didn’t change their pseudo-science, but cleverly changed the name to ‘Climate Change”. [One can disprove warming, but the words change of climate can’t be proved wrong].

The United Nations became interested – major sea level rise could cause havoc in low-lying areas or island groups. They established an Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and invited nations to send delegates. Not surprisingly those chosen were almost entirely Global Warmers, because they clearly knew something about it. But to do them credit the Panel members acted a little more like true scientists than those earlier.

They accepted that “1.4 m in 40 yrs” was wrong and re-evaluated it as “0.49 m by 2100”, [roundly a century ahead]. Thus they dropped 3,500 down to 500 mm/century – to 14% of the original. The cause remained unchanged – our CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. In no other human activity would those involved retain a belief when the most crucial item involved was found to be 86% wrong by themselves. That was a Second Grave Error.

In spite of that, the World was taken in. Politicians were able to promise to save us from the consequences, and the Media had an unending “Field Day”. It wasn’t that people necessarily believed, but they lacked the courage to risk that it might come true, and that they might have to bear the terrible consequences that had been so forcibly promised.

The new value of “0.49 m by 2100” became widely accepted. In New Zealand, District Councils were instructed by Government Departments, like Conservation and Environment, and by Regional Councils, that they must take full account of the risk that “0.49” implied for a sea level rise by 2100. Councils had to consider that in the same way as earthquake and volcanic risk. Yet that “0.49” value doesn’t stand up to the most simple scientific scrutiny.

First, the rate is four times faster than the current sea level rise, as indicated by regional, widely-available tide gauges; second, no reason was given for quadrupling the value, and third, good science interprets “0.49” in this sense as being deliberately different from 0.48 and 0.50. Thus that effectively claims that those who determined that value know, for sure, where sea level will be a century ahead to ±5 mm. That was, and is, patently absurd

These were the Third, Fourth & Fifth Grave Errors.

The United Nations appointed me personally to their UNCSTD Committee which assists small countries with their ability regarding Science and Technology Development. Three or so of us would go to a central city to talk and discuss their options with delegates from regional countries. On one occasion we met in Prague, to assist countries on both sides of the “Iron Curtain”.

While there, we were invited to visit the World’s only “Institute for Global Warming”. It was founded and funded incredibly by the USA and Soviet Union jointly, at the height of their “Cold War”, in an attempt to fund something “for the good of Mankind”, rather than “for armaments”. Some of its staff could have attended the 1985 Conference, and helped create the 1987 World Declaration.

I took the opportunity of asking to see copies of the documents that had been brought to that 1985 Meeting in neutral Austria. Several attendees brought their estimates for sea level rise due to Global Warming. The values, converted to mm/century, ranged from 500 minimum to 3,500 maximum.

There can be no doubt that, to ensure that their 1987 World Declaration made the greatest impact, they published the maximum value – contravening the most sacred rule of acceptable science Thou shall not publish items for monetary, political, or personal gain that are not clear un-biased un-inflated truths.

The fact that “up to” was used, might be allowed in non-scientific areas, but not in Science. If World Media had distorted the message, the Warmers should immediately have denied what was wrongly claimed, and ensured that the proper statement got equal publicity. Using a maximum value for greatest effect was the Sixth (and

 Worst) Grave Error.

OLD SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS ON CLIMATE IGNORED

19th Century science posed a important question. Why is our Earth’s average temperature significantly higher than that calculated from the then-recent determinations of our Sun’s distance and its radiation? Knowing my interests in climate, DSIR librarians found me a publication in German that answered that puzzle early.

It had Scandinavian author(s), if I remember correctly. Its answer was that the CO2 in our atmosphere acts like glass in a glasshouse. Both change the optical physical nature of the Sun’s infra-red rays [that carry the warmth to us] such that they may enter, but cannot then leave. So we are warmed by the heat trapped below our CO2; like the glasshouse below its glass.

I surmise that the Global Warmers, along with Al Gore, noted correctly that CO2 keeps us warm, but thought wrongly that more would make us warmer. The analogy with glass is important. Horticultural experiments long ago found that more (thicker) glass does not cause more warming, so more CO2 probably doesn’t either.

The effect is like that of polarising spectacles, where the change takes place as light begins passing through the lenses. Thickness makes no difference. Polarisation is either 100%, or not at all. A coincidence timed the Little Ice Age’s end with the Industrial Revolution’s start. The Warmers blamed the undoubted warming on the latter – ignoring the glasshouse evidence.

The National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) retains New Zealand climate records. It has a history of persuading successive governments that Global Warming and Climate Change are both real. It often encouraged media headlines like “We are Getting Warmer”, when any news item suggested any higher temperature.

Science progresses by new concepts and ideas being aired freely for scientific scrutiny. That has sometimes taken centuries to be completed. Although I don’t agree with some of NIWA’s views, it is proper that they should be aired for discussion, as in this booklet.

One announcement (that surely originated from NIWA) was very important to me and all citizens, and was a credit to NIWA itself. At the close of 2007, it stated that the decade just finishing was the warmest since New Zealand records began. The announcement added that, of those 10 years, 1998 was the warmest ever since records began.

I was grateful to NIWA, and concluded that 2007 was no warmer than 1998, and probably cooler. I could assume therefore that warming at our 125 rate finished in 1998. In the roundest of figures, the Little Ice Age lasted for some 200 years. There would be no conflict with accepting that the following warming should similarly last for some 200 years.

As always in Science one seeks confirmation whenever possible. I have seen many items that lead to that same view of “no warming since 1998”. The best was a written debate in the Imperial Engineer of autumn 2008. [That scientific journal is produced for engineering graduates of Imperial College, London – arguably UK’s top university in engineering.]

The debate was on whether Humans were to blame for current changes of climate. Prof Joanna Haigh blamed Humans, Lord Monckton blamed Mother Nature. The only point on which they both agreed was that there had been no warming since 1998. That confirmed NIWA’s statement perfectly, along with several comparable pronouncements.

My conclusion is that warming since the Little Ice Age’s end is now almost certainly finished. That was supported further by NIWA’s release at the end of 2012,concerning the Eastern Bay of Plenty. Their report was that 2012 had been drier and colder than 2011.

Citizens also notice that warming seems to be over. Skiing seasons are extended, winter fires are needed earlier, and some of us travelling overseas have been asked by those from Queensland, even Hawaii, whether we in New Zealand feel colder generally – as they do. I conclude that the New Zealand climate has not been warming since 1998.



 Astronomical Cost of Major Measures to Combat a Non-Existent Threat: Politicians and the Media have listened to the proponents of Global-Warming-Climate-Change, but don’t seem to have made any critical assessment of it all.

Perhaps they were bemused by the Global Warmers constantly naming themselves and associates as “Scientists”. As has been shown, those people disregarded the basic rules of true Science. Their political and media audiences innocently believed the statements – which contained grave errors.

Innocents in politics and the media were badly mis-led. They gladly supported projects to combat the non-existent threat of Global-Warming-Climate-Change.

The projects were unnecessary because there was no threat; extremely costly in money time and effort; full of praise where ridicule was deserved misleading about benefits & options; and above all diversionary away from today’s real problems.

A huge international bureaucratic industry was born – with Cabinet Ministers, government departments, company sections, travel, conferences, treaties, carbon credits, and carbon trading, and very much more. The challenge was often heard that we must curb our carbon emissions or sacrifice our grandchildren’s well-being.

In truth, those children were being saddled with a gigantic debt to pay for everything encompassed by the Warmers’ “carbon footprints”, including the salaries and expenses of the loudest proponents.

Perhaps the saddest part has been that the essential and innocent gas, carbon dioxide, has been demonised and criminalised.

It is essential in creating plant growth using chlorophyll and photo-synthesis. It is thus essential for our very existence. Crops grow better in a CO2-enriched and warmer atmosphere, when heated by an oldfashioned vertical kerosene heater. It gives off “carbon emissions” that are valuable to us all.

Costs and Dangers of Local Measures to combat the Non-Existent Threat: Local authorities were compelled to adopt measures designed to combat the nonexistent threat.

Typically, maps were drawn showing the coastline’s position now, and in the year 2100 with intermediate zone(s), assuming that sea level would rise 0.49 m in the next 100 years. Onerous restrictions have been emplaced within the zones that were thus defined.

Many regions have vast quantities of sand transported by rivers to their coast, released by the erosion of hills and mountains, continuously raised by Mother Nature. Their coastline extends seawards steadily.

Citizens in such regions have long noted (with surveys and photos) that the coastline has a net seawards movement. It contrasts with many Councils’ imposed belief in “0.49” which demands landwards movement (“inundation”).

Councils seem unable to accept their citizens’ constant and loud protests about all this. They seem to feel that higher authorities insist that they must ignore such views. It is not just (a) the absurdity of restrictions about where houses may be erected (only inland of certain lines), etc.; or (b) the increasing costs to those building their first home.

At the other end of the scale there are enforced dangers; a requirement for higher floor levels, leading to more steps, with unnecessary risks to elderly folk falling, when using them.

The fact that sea level is no longer rising is a new extra factor for councils to ignore. In the example of Ohope Beach, a Commission of enquiry, set up by Council, backed the Council’s view of landwards inundation.

That rejected all citizens’ factual evidence of seawards net movement for periods ranging from 50 to 5,000 years. Council also rejected the advice, supporting the Citizens, by one who was highly qualified in engineering and science and had had long and successful experience in coastal work.

Much worse, the Council’s own appointed consultants provided an additional report based on every coastal survey for which a record was available.

It showed a “retreat of the sea” [seaward shoreline movement, or accretion] at the only three Ohope sites, of 0.30-0.94 m/yr over 130 years that was still ongoing in 2008. Clearly neither Council nor Commission had bothered to read that critical report, written by highly regarded consultants, who had been appointed for this project by the Council itself.

The widespread obsession with Global-Warming-Climate-Change, in opposition to all factual evidence, is quite incredible. It leads to unfair treatment of some citizens, and a massive bill for all, for nothing useful.

When will citizens revolt effectively against such callous disregard for their observations and wishes, by those who are essentially their elected employees?

When will the perpetrators examine the basis of their ideology, and realise that it’s based on unfounded unscientific beliefs, not on confirmed, widely-available investigations by real scientists who abide by the moral standards of their profession?

Letter to the UN: 500 Climate Scientists & Professionals Sign Letter to UN: ‘There Is No Climate Emergency’

Global Warming Petition Project: 31,000 American scientists have signed a petition asking the US government to reject the Kyoto global warming agreement. A summary of peer-reviewed research is included.

Purpose of Petition: The purpose of the Petition Project is to demonstrate that the claim of “settled science” and an overwhelming “consensus” in favor of the hypothesis of human-caused global warming and consequent climatological damage is wrong. No such consensus or settled science exists. As indicated by the petition text and signatory list, a very large number of American scientists reject this hypothesis.

Publicists at the United Nations, Mr. Al Gore, and their supporters frequently claim that only a few “skeptics” remain – skeptics who are still unconvinced about the existence of a catastrophic human-caused global warming emergency.

It is evident that 31,487 Americans with university degrees in science – including 9,029 PhDs, are not “a few.” Moreover, from the clear and strong petition statement that they have signed, it is evident that these 31,487 American scientists are not “skeptics.”

These scientists are instead convinced that the human-caused global warming hypothesis is without scientific validity and that government action on the basis of this hypothesis would unnecessarily and counterproductively damage both human prosperity and the natural environment of the Earth.",conspiracy
484,"The paper discusses annual to decadal climate variability and change in the European Alps by utilizing the procedure of synoptic downscaling, i.e. it investigates the influence of global to continental scale synoptic structures and processes on the regional climate of the Alps. The European Alps lie to the southeast and under the right exit zone of the southwest-northeast oriented axis of the polar front jet over the North Atlantic ocean, in a transition zone between the Azores high and Icelandic low, between oceanic and continental and between Mediterranean and North Atlantic climates. Together with complex topographically induced phenomena like lee cyclogenesis, orographic precipitation, strong downslope winds and thermotopographical circulation systems, this transitional position makes climate studies in the Alps even more interesting. Only a minor correlation can be observed between global climate variability and Alpine climate. In contrast, the Alpine climate is strongly related to processes over the North Atlantic ocean and its sea ice system (e.g. it has a high correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation and the dynamics and position of the Icelandic low), an area with a rather low climate prediction potential.

Since the early 1970's (or just after the “Great Salinity Anomaly” in the North Atlantic Ocean) the intensification of the wintertime westerly jet over the North Atlantic area led to a noticeable northwest-southeast mass transport in the exit area of the jet over Central Europe, leading to pressure and temperature rises and an increase in the amount of precipitation. There is a question over whether this phenomenon is a consequence of natural climate variability or the beginning of an anthropogenic climate change.",mainstream

• You could be hauled before International Climate Court.

On November 30, nearly 50,000 people will descend on Paris in an effort to conclude “a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 36°F.” Of that massive number, 25,000 are official delegates from 195 countries to the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, including from hundreds of governments, intergovernmental organizations, United Nations (UN) agencies, non-governmental organizations and “civil society.”

Prerequisite to receiving an invitation seems to be a quasi-religious belief in “climate change” and an overriding desire to impose and profit from nation-killing global government.

The confabulation is known officially as the 21st annual Conference of Parties (COP21), also known as the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference, to “review” implementation of the UN Framework on Climate Change, adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. That treaty ostensibly regulates greenhouse gas emissions in order “to avoid ‘dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system,’ ” according to the COP21 website. “Anthropogenic” means “manmade,” so the hidden premise is that human activity is evil—except, of course, for activities of the world-government crowd.

The COP21 acronym is rather ironic, given the stated purpose of concluding “for the first time” an internationally binding legal agreement. Presumably, there would be “climate police” watching over every person’s “carbon footprint” and hauling violators before the International Climate Court.

Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More . . .

Yes, indeed. Hidden on page 19 of 34 in the official draft treaty being presented at the conference is the implementation of an “International Tribunal of Climate Justice.” This unelected, sovereignty-destroying judicial body would mete out “consequences” to developed countries that do not toe the bureaucratic line. What those consequences would be is made clear in the preceding and following paragraphs.

Apparently, some nations are more equal than others. In this case, only developed—i.e., wealthy—countries will be punished. The developing countries will not be coerced at all. Rather, the agreement would potentially “facilitate implementation [of the treaty] by developing country parties through provision of adequate financial resource and transfer of technology.”

Translated into English, that means that when countries like the United States or Germany do not bow down and obey—and perhaps even if they do—their hapless citizens will be taxed severely, fined heavily, and have their technological advances taken and given to more backward “civilizations.” Expect Israel to get a free pass, though. Clearly, this is just the latest incarnation of colonialism and exploitation of those who actually work to advance themselves and their societies.

Who is demanding this massive transfer of wealth—other than the usual gang of international banksters and vulture capitalists? Surprise! It is South Africa, China and India leading the pack. We have to help the “poor” countries, you see—about 130 of them, or two-thirds of the world.

There is, however, an even more sinister side to this story. “Anthropogenic global warming” was chosen decades ago by the elitists seeking to dominate the world as a highly desirable alternative to war, for purposes of controlling the globe and its population.

In 1967, the U.S. government’s top-secret “Report from Iron Mountain” stated, “It may be, for instance, that gross pollution of the environment can eventually replace the possibility of mass destruction by nuclear weapons as the principal apparent threat to the survival of the species. Poisoning of the air, and of the principal sources of food and water supply, is already well advanced, and at first glance would seem promising in this respect; it constitutes a threat that can be dealt with only through social organization and political power.”

In 1991, the infamous New World Order group, the Club of Rome, founded by Maurice Strong, was even more blunt: “In searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like, would fit the bill. In their totality and their interactions these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together . . . all these dangers are caused by human intervention in natural processes, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then is humanity itself.”

The conservative program of nature conservation was replaced with radicalized, Trotskyite “environmentalism,” in order to further the Illuminati’s plans to kill off billions of people and become the diabolical masters of the enslaved remnant of mankind. COP21 is the next heavy link in the chains of bondage.

No matter that “global warming” is a myth, or that more than 1,000 respected scientists have said so. No matter that a new National Aeronautics and Space Administration study states that “an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers.” No matter that, in two months alone, Greenland has had record cold weather and gained 200 billion tons of snow and ice.

Global . . . cooling? No matter. “Climate change” is always mankind’s fault. We have to subjugate the population now, to save the environment.

1221,"Green marketing refers to the practice of developing and advertising products based on their real or perceived environmental sustainability.

Examples of green marketing include advertising the reduced emissions associated with a product’s manufacturing process, or the use of post-consumer recycled materials for a product's packaging. Some companies also may market themselves as being environmentally-conscious companies by donating a portion of their sales proceeds to environmental initiatives, such as tree planting.

When a company’s green marketing activities are not substantiated by significant investments or operational changes, they may be criticized for false or misleading advertising. This practice is also sometimes referred to as greenwashing.

Green marketing is one component of a broader movement toward socially and environmentally conscious business practices. Increasingly, consumers have come to expect companies to demonstrate their commitment to improving their operations alongside various environmental, social, and governmental (ESG) criteria. To that end, many companies will distribute social impact statements on an ongoing basis, in which they periodically self-report on their progress toward these goals.

Typical examples of ESG-related improvements include the reduction of carbon emissions involved in a company’s operations, the maintenance of high labor standards both domestically and throughout international supply chains, and philanthropic programs designed to support the communities in which the company operates. Although green marketing refers specifically to environmental initiatives, these efforts are increasingly presented alongside social and governmental policies as well.

There are many incentives for companies that choose to engage in green marketing. To begin with, a companies’ perceived commitment to environmental causes is an increasingly important factor influencing many consumers' spending habits. The 2014 Nielsen Global Survey on Corporate Responsibility, for example, found that roughly 55% of consumers were willing to accept higher prices from companies deemed to have a positive social and environmental impact—a 10% increase from the previous survey in 2011. In some regions, such as Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, this attitude was even more common, shared by roughly 65% of respondents in 2014.

Starbucks (SBUX) is often cited as a leader in green marketing practices. The company has invested heavily in various social and environmental initiatives in recent years. For example, in its 2018 Global Social Impact Report, Starbucks reported that it had committed over $140 million between 2016 and 2018 on the development of renewable energy sources. The goal of this ongoing project is to power 100% of the company’s 9,000 United States stores.

Similarly, the company has made investments in social impact projects through initiatives such as the Starbucks College Achievement Plan. Through this project, all U.S.-based Starbucks employees are eligible to receive fully-paid tuition to the online undergraduate degree program offered by Arizona State University. This project, as well as similar commitments in areas related to the employment of veterans, have formed an important part of Starbucks’ green marketing initiatives.

From an investor point-of-view, these kinds of green marketing initiatives can prove essential in building and maintaining a valuable brand, particularly for consumer-facing companies such as Starbucks. However, some critics argue that green marketing can exacerbate the existing advantages of larger companies at the expense of their small or mid-sized competitors. After all, implementing robust social or environmental programs often involves additional overhead costs. For large companies, these costs can easily be born and may even form part of the company’s existing marketing budget.

The government had hoped that both technologies would contribute to emissions reductions required by 2050.

But the report’s authors say ministers should assume that neither carbon capture and storage (CCS) nor hydrogen will be running ""at scale"" by 2050.

They say the government must start a debate on other, controversial steps.

These actions, which they say would need to be implemented in the near-term, include cutting down on flying and eating red meat.

UK law dictates that, by 2050, carbon emissions will be virtually halted, and any remaining emissions will have to be compensated for by activities such as tree planting.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has regularly expressed the belief that technology would mostly solve the problem.

But the authors say that if new tech does emerge at scale by 2050, the government should treat it as a bonus, not an expectation.

Both of the new technologies in question have their supporters in politics and in industry.

Hydrogen technology entails generating hydrogen from natural gas, or from water.

CCS entails capturing CO2 emissions from power stations or industry, and burying them in rock formations or finding uses for the CO2. Both are expensive.

A few years ago, government economists predicted that gas plants equipped with CCS would be producing 30% of the UK’s clean electricity in the future. Nuclear and renewables would produce another 30% each.

Tom Burke, an expert on climate change, forecast at that time that only CCS could save the climate. When I reminded him yesterday, he admitted: “I was wrong”.

The equation radically changed because the nuclear renaissance didn’t happen; the government pulled funding from CCS projects; and the cost of renewables plummeted.

The government has now offered new CCS funds - but for tackling carbon emissions from industrial clusters, rather than from power generation.

The new technology report comes from a government-funded consortium of academics from Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham, Bath and Imperial College London.

It’s being debated in the Lords on Thursday. The debate’s sponsor, Baron Browne of Ladyton, said it carries important messages that should be heard.

The report says: “Businesses and the public want to act to eliminate emissions, but exaggerated claims about the speed at which new technologies can be introduced are holding back progress.""

It continued: “Relying on breakthrough technologies to achieve zero emissions by 2050 is risky and delays action.

“Instead, with today’s technologies we can meet the target for almost all activities, but we have no substitutes for cement, shipping, flying, lamb or beef.”

The report says the UK can anticipate having four times as much emissions-free electricity in 2050 as today if current rates of renewables expansion continue.

This, it says, is enough to supply 60% of today’s energy-using activities, if they are electrified.

It says to close the remaining energy gap, we could make incremental changes to the way we use technologies - such as buying smaller cars rather than SUVs.

Another option is to take the train instead of the car, or put more passengers in fewer cars (ride sharing).

Yet another possibility is to only heat rooms where people are sitting, and swap gas boilers for heat pumps when they need to be changed.

The government, the report says, should start a debate on these issues.

It says the two outstandingly difficult areas to de-carbonise are shipping and cement manufacture.

Julian Allwood, lead author and professor of engineering and the environment at Cambridge University, told BBC News: ""The problem with delivering climate mitigation is the tension between the government wanting to deliver solutions based on technology and protestors and scientists asking for fast action that bites much more rapidly than we can bring new technologies into place.

""So although new technologies may become relevant by 2100, the number operating at scale in 2050 will be very few. Probably we’ve got to deliver on climate change with today’s technologies.""

The message contradicts several comments from the Prime Minister putting faith in technology to deliver 2050 targets. Recently, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said no one needed to fly less, and that technology would solve the problem.

The government has committed to having CCS in industrial clusters from the second half of the 2020s and CCS at scale by 2030.

The net zero scenario from the Committee on Climate Change includes 75-175 Megatonnes (Mt) of CO2 being captured and stored per year by 2050.

The report's authors say it typically takes 30 years for a major new technology such as carbon capture to solve all its complexities, including legal and safety implications; and public concerns, before it begins to be widely adopted.

But this will be too late to hit the government's 2050 targets.

A government spokesperson said: ""Achieving net zero by 2050 requires decisive action across the economy, including developing a range of approaches and technologies.

""Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS), for example, can play an essential role as part of a balanced approach. Our ambition is to be a world leader in this technology.""",mainstream
26,"Shrinking shores: Half the world's beaches could disappear because of climate change, study says

Half of the world's beaches could disappear by 2100 because of severe erosion linked to climate change, a study published Monday suggests.

The main causes are sea-level rise and erosion from storms, the study says, which warned of ""the near-extinction of almost half of the world's sandy beaches by the end of the century.""

Beaches in the United States will be ""greatly affected,"" as will shorelines in Canada, Mexico, China and Chile. In the U.S., beaches along the East Coast and the Gulf Coast will experience the most erosion, lead author Michalis Vousdoukas said in an e-mail to USA TODAY.

Vousdoukas, of the European Union’s Joint Research Center in Ispra, Italy, and other researchers used satellite images to track the way beaches have changed over the past 30 years and simulated how global warming might affect them in the future.

The study found that West Africa will see some of the worst losses, where more than 60% of sandy coastline may be lost in countries such as The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau.

Australia will also take a hit: When the total length of sandy beach projected to be lost is analyzed, Australia would be hit the hardest, with more than 7,000 miles at risk.

Beaches are valuable for recreation, tourism and wildlife while also providing a natural barrier that protects coastal communities from waves and storms.

Shrinking ice: Arctic may see 'ice-free' summers in as few as 15 years, study says

“The projected shoreline changes will substantially impact the shape of the world’s coastline,” more than a third of which is sandy beach, the authors write.

Sea-level rise is the dominant cause of the predicted loss of the world's beaches, especially in eastern North America, Vousdoukas said.

""Sea level has been increasing at an accelerated rate during the past 25 years and will continue to do so with climate change,"" the study says. ""There is a clear cause-and-effect relationship between increasing sea levels and shoreline retreat, pointing to increased coastal erosion issues.""

Andres Payo, an expert on coastal hazards and resilience at the British Geological Survey, who wasn't involved in the study, said that while the study’s methods are sound, its claims should be treated with caution.

“There are many assumptions and generalizations that could change the outcome of the analysis both qualitatively and quantitatively,” Payo said.

The study’s authors calculate that up to 40% of shoreline retreat could be prevented by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change but say large and growing populations living along the coast will need to be protected through other measures.

Citing the example of the Netherlands, which has battled the sea for centuries and even reclaimed substantial areas of low-lying land, the authors say that “past experience has shown that effective site-specific coastal planning can mitigate beach erosion, eventually resulting in a stable coastline.”

The study was published in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Climate Change.",mainstream

402,"Will Trump Be The Disclosure President?

 by Rich Scheck

With all the apparent good news regarding UFOs with its implication for the much cherished end to the Truth Embargo, the possibility looms that Donald Trump will be the Disclosure President.

Currently the planet is in a pre-world war mode similar to 1914 and 1939 with many proxy wars, trade wars and wide-spread economic uncertainty as well as an ineffective United Nations.

Amidst all the chaos, confusion and suffering lurks the ever-present dynamic of other-worldly visitation—-whether from ETs, Angelic Entities or some as yet to be determined class of beings.

Reports of UFOs remain high. The US government continues to legitimize discussion of the topic with its recent announcements, so much so that the New York Times (the”unofficial paper of record”) has felt comfortable enough to give it credence with several articles.

Steve Bassett said a few weeks ago that “Full Disclosure is Imminent!” I challenged that contention but may soon have to acknowledge he was right. My joy in doing so will be enhanced if Disclosure is indeed “Full” and free of any taint of an inauthentic official narrative that some suspect with the rise of To The Stars Academy and ATTIP.

Even Richard and Tracy Dolan seem eager to jump on the “Disclosure may be happening now” band-wagon. Certainly a strong case can be made that something along those lines is afoot.

The irony of all this is that if Disclosure does happen soon (imminent means in a “few” days to me), that would make Trump the Disclosure President much to the chagrin of many who detest him and would have preferred to see Hillary earn that title.

There is obviously a push for some sort of Disclosure, perhaps as a limited hang-out to distract from the coming war with Iran and/or to deflect the public’s attention from other chaos around the planet. But the real agenda may be as a path to some form of global government and, dare I say it, peace!

Remember, it was Ronald Reagan who spoke at the UN about the unifying role ET visitation might have to quell Earthly discord. Perhaps, the planetary quarantine described by Alfred Webre in his book Exopolitics, is coming to end by virtue of enough humans having evolved enough to recapture their Universal citizenship and/or the level of crisis being so great with the potential use of nuclear weapons by combatants that an outside intervention is deemed mandatory by……….Them!

It is now a presidential tradition for attempts to achieve US/Russian space cooperation. JFK reached out to Khrushchev; Reagan interjected the topic in his dialogues with Gorbachev with Mike Salla among those who believe Trump has addressed the matter in his private chats with Putin.

On a subtle level, some saw the 2016 election between Trump and Clinton as a quiet battle for who would best champion this issue. Trump prevailed but RussiaGate has significantly undermined his ability to govern. With all the current UFO revelations, it might be argued that they represent a rear-guard action of the Hillary forces to keep her place in the race for Disclosure or a way for Trump to seize the High Ground. (Maybe they are actually colluding on the issue with no jail for Hillary and no impeachment for Trump!)

Some may hope she can emerge as the Democratic nominee again if things get out of hand among the 20+ prospects vying for contention. Folks like John Podesta may be dreaming she can fulfill her destiny to be the first woman to capture the White House and use that position to be the Disclosure President.

A Trump/Clinton rematch with a more open battle regarding the UFO issue may be desirable for many. But an even better scenario for me would be to see someone new who lacks the massive negative baggage of both of those individuals—someone young, articulate and courageous like Tulsi Gabbard—who would take up the issue and bring elegance as well as credibility to this important issue of global security and human progress.",conspiracy
233,"In the blink of a geological eye, more than 50% of the world's coral reefs have disappeared — wiped out by factors like warming waters, pollution and overfishing — all within the past few decades. That in itself is disturbing, but new research reveals an even more distressing finding: virtually all of the coral reef habitat on Earth is likely to vanish by the end of this century.

""By 2100, it's looking quite grim,"" said Renee Setter, a biogeographer at the University of Hawaii Manoa, who presented the new findings at a conference on ocean sciences this week.

The research team simulated future ocean conditions like sea surface temperature, wave energy, acidity, pollution, and overfishing in areas where corals now exist. The team found most parts of the ocean where coral reefs live today won't be suitable habitats for corals by 2045, and virtually no suitable habitats will be left by 2100.

Coral reefs are a vital building block of Earth's oceans systems, nurturing 25% of marine life and supporting local economies worldwide. All told, coral reef benefits are valued at an estimated $10 trillion annually.

The new study is especially disheartening considering recent promising efforts to rehabilitate coral reefs, which have resulted in 60% survival rates of restored corals. The new study means even if coral is restored in the short term, warmer and more acidic oceans due to human-caused climate change may soon overwhelm those efforts.

That's because coral reefs are extremely sensitive to warming waters. An increase of just a couple of degrees in sea surface temperature over a few weeks can lead to mass bleaching, a phenomena where coral turns white as it expels the symbiotic algae it relies on for survival and for its vibrant colors. Bleaching itself does not kill, but it weakens corals, making them more susceptible to disease and death.

Climate change is a double whammy for coral, due both to ocean heating and acidification from dissolved carbon dioxide. The world's official climate body, the United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change, projects that coral reefs will decline by 70% to 90% in the next couple of decades and by 99% percent if global warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

In recent decades, tropical sea surface temperatures have increased by more than 1 degree Fahrenheit and there has been a significant increase in marine heat waves, which are responsible for mass bleaching events like the one that devastated the Great Barrier Reef in 2016.

Because of the burning of fossil fuels, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen by nearly 40% since the mid 1800s. One quarter of the carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean, and as a result the oceans are becoming more acidic. The higher acid levels dissolve shells of marine life and stunt coral building.

Current trends provide little reason for hope, but Setter points to great research being done around the world trying to identify the most hardy corals through assisted evolution, as a last-ditch effort to save coral reefs from vanishing.

""I believe there is hope that they will be able to identify corals that may withstand climate change,"" said Setter. ""The question becomes if they would be able to replenish and restore coral to the same extent that the ecosystem exists today. Coral restoration is a slow and time consuming process.""

Dr. Mark Eakin, coordinator of NOAA's Coral Reef Watch Program, shares Setter's concerns. He says there's evidence that coral reef restoration, like transplanting corals adapted to higher temperatures, is working. But he believes the more resilient coral won't likely be able to compete with the pace of climate change.

""It's unlikely the adapted corals will be able to keep up with projected increases in the frequency and intensity of marine heat waves,"" Eakin said.

Both sea surface temperatures and ocean acidity are projected to increase markedly in the coming decades. And while combating pollution and overfishing is important, Setter says the main issue for coral is a warmer and more acidic ocean.

""At the end of the day, fighting climate change is really what we need to be advocating for in order to protect corals,"" she said.

Eakin puts it bluntly: ""The most important point to make is that all the restoration and assisted evolution work will be wasted if we don't move to carbon-free energy. That means bringing emissions to zero and mechanisms to remove excess carbon from the atmosphere.""",mainstream
665,"This article was originally published on April 19, 2010, at Britannica’s , a blog dedicated to inspiring respect for and better treatment of animals and the environment.

A butterfly’s life is an epic journey in which each life-altering adventure is preceded by a swift and dramatic transformation effected through metamorphosis. The fluidity of transformation from one stage to the next is synchronous with the rhythms of nature, and similar to many other cyclic natural phenomena, the metamorphosis of butterflies is sensitive to the climatic whims of shifting seasons.

According to butterflies, however, in recent decades these seemingly trivial fluctuations in weather have been far from inconsequential. Indeed, the messages that have been relayed by the insects, namely that the temperatures in their native habitats are heating up, have resulted in the emergence of new and telling chapters in their life stories. These amendments have been necessitated by global warming, a conspicuously unnatural change in climate fueled by the heat of human activity.

Many butterflies possess an unusually heightened sensitivity to overly warm environs. Minute increases in temperature, imperceptible to humans, are of such significance to butterflies that they have triggered new patterns in the ancient process of metamorphosis and have even driven the creatures out of their native habitats. Each species of butterfly and moth (known collectively as lepidopterans) responds differently to warming trends. For one species in particular, the European grapevine moth ( ), a slight rise in temperature can tempt pupae out of their shells much earlier in the spring than is usual for the species.

Between 1984 and 2006 in southwestern Spain, which forms part of the native range of the European grapevine moth, the average spring temperature increased by 3 °C and the average yearly temperature by 0.9 °C. Other than scientists, presumably few people over that period of time actually noticed these increases. Fewer still were likely to have noticed the emergence of the moth’s pupae occurring progressively earlier in the spring. Yet, over the course of two decades, the life cycle of the moth has advanced by at least 12 days, an effect linked directly to warming temperatures. In particularly warm years, the moths may produce an additional brood, essentially a bumper crop of offspring. Because the moth is an infamous pest of grapevines, these changes in life cycle can have negative consequences on grape production for local growers.

In multiple parts of the world, the majority of native butterflies are on the move as a result of local climate warming. They are leaving their natural homes and taking up residence in places with cooler average temperatures. This phenomenon has been well characterized in Europe and the United Kingdom. Although the latter is a region historically home to few moths and butterflies, in the last century alone some 89 species of these insects have migrated there permanently, having flown north from southern Europe.

Since 1982, when butterfly tracking began at the Portland Bird Observatory, located on a small peninsula in the county of Dorset, scientists have accumulated an abundance of data demonstrating a steady expansion in the array of butterflies and moths making landfall on the southern shores of England. The arrival of new species to the area appears to be directly associated with increases in local temperatures in southwestern Europe. In fact, for every 1 °C increase in southwestern Europe’s temperature, some 14 different species of migratory butterflies and moths are forced to make the leap to England to cool off, which means making a long journey over open water.

The perils of long migrations are many, and in some instances the obstacles that must be overcome may make a move impossible. The inability of the tiny Quino checkerspot butterfly ( ), native to California and northern Mexico, to navigate successfully around Los Angeles to reach a cooler climate underscores the significance of the human role in the lives of butterflies. The Quino checkerspot is listed as endangered and is protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Climate change and habitat fragmentation (caused by land development) threaten its survival.

If fragmentation were the only problem facing its recovery, the species would become more populous in the areas within its native range that are largely unaffected by anthropogenic factors. This could be accomplished via migration to the southern portion of its range lying in Mexico. Sadly, however, climate change has rendered these last areas of hope too warm and dry for the Quino checkerspot, and to cross the gulf of the endless urban expanse of Los Angeles to plunge further north, into cooler habitat, is an impossible feat for the tiny insect. There are no safe stopover points in the city for the butterflies, no safe havens where they can periodically rest and replenish their energy along the way.

Many ecologists believe that the Quino checkerspot’s only hope is assisted migration, in which humans lend a helping hand by transplanting cocoons into a new range, north of the city and at suitable altitudes. This form of artificial migration, however, comes with its own host of problems, including a possible change to the ESA that would allow for the deliberate introduction of an endangered species into a habitat beyond the bounds of its native range.

The Quino checkerspot is a subspecies of Edith’s checkerspot butterfly ( ), which is now considered to be an early warning indicator of climate change in North America, because of its exceptionally high sensitivity to warming temperatures. In tracking the movements and population declines or expansions experienced by indicator species such as Edith’s checkerspot, scientists are able to assess the condition of the insect’s environment and surrounding areas.

Edith’s checkerspot, however, is not the only species trying to tell us something. Indeed, all the butterflies that have moved from warming regions to cooler areas have carried a message, one that is urgent, but subtle. It is a whisper on the wind, in the language of nature, which few members of our own species fully comprehend. As global warming and climate change continue, butterflies will increasingly find themselves unable to live with us. And in return for our heedless treatment of their habitats, we will lose some of Earth’s most beautiful creatures, perhaps the only insects that universally bring us joy and constantly amaze us with their simultaneously delicate and vibrant character.",mainstream

 In almost every newspaper around the world and at least once a week, some report surfaces suggesting we stay worried in the light of latest figures and analyses. Not only is Global Warming occurring, we are assured, but it is now accelerating at some alarming rate and pretty soon the poles will have all melted, the sealevels will have risen and all low-lying atolls and seaside villages will be covered over with this calamitous rising tide. And apparently this gigantic catastrophe is due to human behaviour. 

 We are informed that if our wicked CFC and CO2-producing ways continue, we will be doomed as a civilisation. Today we are so buffeted by what is put forth as irrefutable evidential science as to the nature of the so-called problem, that we don't even think to question it on any basic level. What is still essentially viewpoints and nothing more, based on tiny sample data and extrapolated, is now promoted as scientific fact, regardless of the lack of real evidence.

During the 1980s, UNICEF assisted the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in the drafting of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. After its introduction to the U.N. General Assembly in 1989, the Convention on the Rights of the Child became the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history, and UNICEF played a key role in ensuring its enforcement.

Of the 184 member states of the United Nations, only two countries have failed to ratify the treaty–Somalia and the United States.

189,"The elite definitely does not want the truth about Epstein and his island to be revealed to the public. Since the heat was put on the billionaire months ago, there’s been desperate efforts to filter, erase and destroy damning evidence on Epstein’s properties. This extreme panic culminated in the extremely suspicious “suicide” of Jeffrey Epstein, a convenient death for hundreds of power people who knew him.

Because there is much more to the Epstein case than the “soliciting of minors”. It was operating a massive system of child abduction, transport, and abuse that involved a great number of high-powered individuals. And it is suspected that the most violent and horrific acts were being committed far from public view: Inside underground tunnels on Epstein’s remote private island.

In the article Jeffrey Epstein: The True Ugly Face of the Occult Elite, I examined several bizarre and symbolic features on Epstein Island. One of them was the presence of entrances that apparently lead to underground tunnels. I also mentioned sources that have been claiming, since last year, that Epstein was spending millions of dollars to bury tunnels underneath the “temple” on the island.

This week, the Daily Mail released exclusive information that seems corroborate these suspicions.

On November 7th, 2018, Epstein had a $100,000 self-loading cement mixer delivered to his island using an Express Bill Of Lading – an unusual and expensive shipping method that does not require the cargo to be “released”. This shipping method requires the customer to pay for the goods up front, making them responsible if damage occurs during shipment. In short, Epstein needed this machine fast.

While the cement could have been used for regular construction, the timing and the urgency of the shipment are suspicious. William George, an analyst with shipping data firm Import Genius, stated:

“While the purchase of the cement mixer on its own is not suspicious, particularly given the reported and approved repair of cisterns on Little St. James, both the timing of the shipment and the fact that it’s the item in our records shipped with an express bill of lading do raise concerns. The shipment arrived Epstein’s island on November 7, 2018, 21 days before Julie Brown’s expose was published in the Miami Herald and 23 days before Epstein allegedly began to try to pay off witnesses. Considering both the scope of Brown’s article and the urgency of the shipment, the possibility that the cement mixer was used to literally cover up evidence cannot be discounted.”

In an interview on SiriusXM, U.S. Virgin Islands Senator Oakland Benta admitted that evidence from Epstein’s estate “may have been lost”. On August 13, Benta said of federal authorities investigating the island:

“What’s going on here is what should have happened a long time ago. As a result of all that has transpired, the federal government decided [to investigate] now, whether it’s too late or not — because there have been so many people on the island since Mr. Epstein has been incarcerated and, at the same time, there’s valuable information, evidence-wise, that we may have lost. What’s going on is that they have seized the island, and they’re moving forward and doing, probably, what you call asset forfeiture, as far as securing what they can. I do pray that once the investigation has taken place, as a result of so many people within this territory who are the leadership of this government, of this territory, hiding behind curtains as parasites, and … bringing young ladies to our shores from elsewhere and destroying their lives at will, with passion, without consideration for the child’s soul. And many individuals who participated in these acts are fathers themselves; they have children as well. I’m very upset that our very government leadership, stewardship of this government, who are part of it — participated and turned a blind eye for financial gain.”

The government of the U.S. Virgin Islands was indeed extremely lenient towards Epstein. According to permit records, the bizarre “temple” on Epstein’s island was supposed to be drastically different. Indeed, the construction project presented to the government was supposed to be a “music pavilion”. Furthermore, the submitted design was drastically different.

Therefore, even before the temple was built, false information was submitted to the authorities regarding the actual layout of the island.

The Daily Mail also reported on other bizarre shipments to the Island made in the past years. For instance, Epstein had a fully equipped dentist chair imported from China on September 9th, 2013.

What was the chair used for? And is it still there? Where is it exactly?

In 2008, Epstein had an industrial shredder weighing 53lbs shipped to the island. The shredder can destroy CDs, three-ring binders and hardbound documents – and up to 85 sheets of paper per pass.

The FBI raided Little St. James Island shortly after Epstein’s death. According to many, authorities waiting way too long to take action, allowing Epstein and his associates to take drastic measures to bury, conceal and to destroy evidence. Let’s hope that some evidence was secured beforehand. Because this case cannot conveniently die the same way Epstein did.",conspiracy

974,"(Reuters) - Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) said on Monday it will invest 1 billion euros in a fund to invest in climate change projects and reduce to net zero greenhouse gas emissions from all its products by 2039, 11 years ahead of the Paris Agreement deadline.

Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company whose brands include Dove soap and Knorr soup, said it was responding to the “scale and urgency” of the climate change crisis.

The fund will invest in projects including reforestation, water preservation and carbon sequestration over the next ten years, it said.

The net zero emission target is an extension of efforts already underway to cut emissions within the company by 2030 - such as reducing electricity consumption within offices.

Unilever’s total greenhouse gas footprint was around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2019 according to its website.

“We are now going much wider in our commitments, we call it a cradle to shelf commitment...across the value chain,” Unilever Chief Supply Chain Officer, Marc Engel said.

Unilever, which has an annual turnover of 52 billion euros ($58.5 billion), said it would prioritise partnerships with suppliers who have set emission reduction targets and has set up a system where suppliers must declare the carbon footprint of goods and services provided. All packaging will show the carbon footprint of the product in the future, the company said.

Unilever joins a handful of companies in promising net zero emissions from their supply chain.

Kit-Kat maker Nestle (NESN.S) and German elevator maker Thyssenkrupp AG (TKAG.DE) are others though their targets are set for 2050, which is the deadline set by the Paris Agreement on climate change to limit global warming to 1.5° degrees.

Unilever on Monday also said that it aims to make all product formulations biodegradable and achieve a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023, among a raft of other moves to fight climate change.

The company said it will use satellite monitoring, geolocation tracking and blockchain among other digital technologies to increase traceability and transparency within its supply chain.",mainstream
365,"How might a single threat, even one deemed unlikely, spiral into an evolving global crisis which challenges the foundations of global security, economic stability and democratic governance, all in the matter of a few weeks?

My research on threats to national security, governance and geopolitics has focused on exactly this question, albeit with a focus on the disruptive potential of climate change, rather than a novel coronavirus. In recent work alongside intelligence and defence experts at the think-tank Center for Climate and Security, I analysed how future warming scenarios could disrupt security and governance worldwide throughout the 21st century. Our culminating report, A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change, was launched in Washington just as the first coronavirus cases were spreading undetected across the US.

The analysis uses future scenarios to imagine how and where regions might be increasingly vulnerable to the resource, weather and economic shocks brought about by an increasingly destabilised climate. In it, we warn:

Little did we know when writing these words and imagining the rapidly evolving shocks to come, that a very similar test of our global system was already brewing as governments sputtered to contain the damage of COVID-19.

Over the first few crucial weeks of this crisis, we’ve seen world leaders take a number of actions that indicate how climate shocks could destabilise the world order. With climate change disasters, as with infectious diseases, rapid response time and global coordination are of the essence. At this stage in the COVID-19 situation, there are three primary lessons for a climate-changing future: the immense challenge of global coordination during a crisis, the potential for authoritarian emergency responses, and the spiralling danger of compounding shocks.

First, while the COVID-19 crisis has engendered a massive public response, governments have been largely uncoordinated in their efforts to manage the virus’s spread. According to Oxford’s COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, countries vary widely in the stringency of their policies, with no two countries implementing a synchronised course of action.

While traditionally a great power like the US might step forward to direct a collective international response, instead the Trump administration has repeatedly chosen to blindside its allies with the introduction of new limitations on trade and movement of peoples. This mismanagement has led to each nation going on its own, despite the fact that working together would net greater gains for all. As the New York Times’s Mark Landler put it, the voices of world leaders are forming “less a choir than a cacophony”, leading to mixed global messages, undetected spread, and ongoing fights over limited resources.

In the face of climate change, such a lack of coordination could be be highly destabilising to world social and economic order. The mass displacement of people, the devaluation of assets, rising seas and natural disasters will call for shared practices and common decency in the face of continued tragedy. Many climate impacts will raise new questions the world has yet to answer. What do we do with nation-states that can no longer reside in their homeland? How do we compensate sectors for ceasing harmful practices such as fossil fuel extraction and deforestation, especially where national economies may depend on them?

We also face new global governance questions around the use of risky geoengineering technologies, which can be deployed unilaterally to alter local climates, but with the potential for vast unintended regional or even global consequences. These are challenges which, like climate change itself, can only be solved collectively through coordinated policies and clear communication. The sort of wayward responses and lack of leadership in response to COVID-19 would only lead to further destruction of livelihoods and order in the decades to come.

This historic moment is also offering new opportunities for leaders to further dangerous, illiberal agendas. Authoritarians have long used emergency situations as a pretext to further curtail individual rights and consolidate personal power against backdrops of real or imagined public danger. We’ve seen these actions spiral worldwide in the past month in autocracies and backsliding democracies, alike.

President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines has given security services the directive to open fire on protestors while Vladimir Putin is deploying mass surveillance technologies and new criminal penalties to monitor the Russian population. Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán has forced new emergency powers through parliament that muzzle political opposition and allow for his indefinite rule. Even the supposed democratic bastions of the US and the UK are seeing worrying signs of autocratic policies, as surveillance drones are deployed to monitor citizens, scientific expertise is undermined, and open-ended emergency powers are granted to police forces for undetermined time frames.

A warming world will only result in more disaster-related events for power-hungry leaders to take advantage of in the years ahead. From the nationalisation of resources to the deployment of militaries in response to climate shocks, it can be all-too-easy for public safety needs to bleed into personal political opportunities. The second-order effects of climate change, from supply chain instability to the migration of peoples, will also provide authoritarian leaders more fodder for their ethno-nationalist ideologies, which inflame divisions in society and could help broaden their personal appeal. Without clear and sturdy limits on executive power, the disruptive impacts of climate change will be used to further chip away at democratic freedoms across the world.

Overlapping shocks are the new normal

Finally, this situation is teaching the globalised world new lessons on the devastating consequences of compounding shocks. Managing a deadly global pandemic is bad enough, even before you layer on the massive unemployment, trade disruptions and economic shutdown that its mitigation sets in motion.

The months ahead will bring about additional crises – some related to the pandemic, like a massive uptick in public debt used to bail out national economies. But other near-term shocks may themselves be climate change-induced, from new forecasts for large-scale floods this spring in the central US, to a prospective repeat of 2019’s severe summer heat waves across Europe.

These disasters have the potential to strike just at the time when people are being advised to shelter inside, many in at-risk areas and without adequate indoor cooling. Overlapping, historic shocks like this are becoming the new normal in our climate-changed era. As public disaster response budgets spiral and loss of life mounts each year, governments will continue to struggle to contain their compounding damage.

Scientists and security professionals alike have long warned about the devastating potential of climate change, alluding to how it might rattle our global governance systems to breaking point. But few could have expected that the fissures in our institutions would be revealed so soon, let alone on such a disturbingly large scale.

We can treat the current global crisis as a sort of “stress test” on these institutions, exposing their vulnerabilities but also providing the urgent impetus to build new resilience. In that light, we could successfully rebound from this moment with more solid global security and cooperation than we knew going into it. Decision-makers should take a hard look at their current responses, problem-solving methods, and institutional design with future climate forecasts like our Threat Assessment in mind.

We know that even steeper and more frequent global shocks are in store, particularly without serious climate change mitigation efforts. What we don’t yet know is whether we’ll repeat current patterns of mismanagement and abuse, or if we’ll chart a more proactive and resilient course through the risks that lie ahead.

654,"More than a decade of overwhelming evidence links air pollution and heat exposure with negative pregnancy outcomes in the US, according to a new review of dozens of studies.

The investigation, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, identified 57 studies since 2007 showing a significant association between the two factors and the risk of pre-term birth, low birth weight and stillbirth.

Black mothers were particularly at risk, as were people with asthma.

The review analyzed 32m births tracked across 68 studies. Of those, 84% found air pollution and heat to be risk factors.

Human-caused climate disturbances are forcing temperatures higher, raising humidity and reducing people’s ability to cool off even at night. Climate change also makes air pollution worse. Smog from the burning of fossil fuels forms on hot days. And wildfires that cause smoke inhalation are exacerbated by the crisis.

“When you talk about climate, people think about severe weather, big storms or huge fires … but we wanted to talk about the impacts that are common and widespread and ongoing and also are rarely attributed to the climate crisis,” said Bruce Bekkar, a co-author of the study and a retired obstetrician.

“We are already having generations weakened from birth. There’s just no way we can allow that to happen, and I would like to see not just mothers and their husbands and kids show up at council meetings, but I’d like to see many more health professionals involved in calling for legislation that reduces the ongoing and really pretty scary health burdens of the climate crisis.”

The findings come as the Trump administration has sought to weaken pollution protections and climate efforts, including by rolling back standards for car and power plant emissions. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency has also ignored scientists’ advice to enact stricter air quality rules.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already finds climate change to be an urgent threat to women’s health, in addition to a major public health challenge. Climate change is linked with worsening cardiac disease, respiratory disease, mental health and exposure to infectious diseases. But pregnant women and developing fetuses are especially vulnerable to its effects.

In the review, 19 studies linked air pollution to pre-term birth, defined as a baby born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Twenty-five studies linked air pollution to low birth weight. And four studies linked air pollution to stillbirth. One study found the risk of stillbirth increased 42% with high third-trimester exposure. Stillbirth is rare, so data on it is limited and it is difficult to draw broad conclusions about why it happens, Bekkar said.

The review considered studies about smog, also called ozone, and fine particle pollution.

Emerging science is increasingly linking air pollution to a range of health problems, including dementia. A new rodent-based study from the University of California, Davis, finds that traffic-related air pollution is connected to an increased risk for changes in brain development that might cause neurodevelopmental disorders.

“What we witnessed are subtle changes,” co-author Kelley Patten said. “But we are seeing these effects using air pollution exposures that fall within regulatory limits.”

There were fewer studies on the effect of heat on pregnancies to review, but almost all of them found it to be harmful. One study posits that the risk of early birth increased 11.6% with every 5.6C increase. Global average temperatures are already more than 1C higher than since before industrialization and are on track to rise to 3C higher.

The review confirmed black mothers are at greater risk for pre-term birth and low birth weight. Social determinants of health – including poverty, long-term stress levels and access to healthcare –disproportionately hurt people of color.

The study concludes that “environmental exposures further exacerbate that background risk and could be included among these social determinants”.

Americans increasingly understand that the climate crisis is harming human health, according to a survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

This year, far more Americans were likely to respond that they expect heatstrokes, asthma, diseases carried by insects and pollen-related allergies to get worse as the planet warms.

For example, in 2014, 37% of Americans thought heatstrokes caused by extreme heat waves would become more common. In April, 57% did.

A growing movement among medical practitioners aims to educate patients about climate change. Bekkar hopes health professionals will share the review’s findings with their patients and urge them to avoid prolonged exposures to heat and pollution.

“It’s not possible for everybody, but those that can should. If someone doesn’t have an air conditioner at home and is pregnant, the more time they can spend in air-conditioned places that have filtered air, the better for their pregnancy outcome,” Bekkar said.

But he also wants women’s advocates to demand more from elected officials.

“Reducing air pollution and fighting climate change is a matter of their children’s survival and health,” he said.",mainstream

1308,"Perhaps the most intensively discussed and researched topic in climate variability is the role of interactions and feedbacks among the various components of the Earth system. The feedbacks involve different components that operate at different rates and timescales. Ice sheets, sea ice, terrestrial vegetation, ocean temperatures, weathering rates, ocean circulation, and greenhouse gas concentrations are all influenced either directly or indirectly by the atmosphere; however, they also all feed back into the atmosphere, thereby influencing it in important ways. For example, different forms and densities of vegetation on the land surface influence the albedo, or reflectivity, of Earth’s surface, thus affecting the overall radiation budget at local to regional scales. At the same time, the transfer of water molecules from soil to the atmosphere is mediated by vegetation, both directly (from transpiration through plant stomata) and indirectly (from shading and temperature influences on direct evaporation from soil). This regulation of latent heat flux by vegetation can influence climate at local to global scales. As a result, changes in vegetation, which are partially controlled by climate, can in turn influence the climate system. Vegetation also influences greenhouse gas concentrations; living plants constitute an important sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide, whereas they act as sources of carbon dioxide when they are burned by wildfires or undergo decomposition. These and other feedbacks among the various components of the Earth system are critical for both understanding past climate changes and predicting future ones.

(Left) In a preagricultural landscape, large forest-covered areas of low surface albedo alternate with large open areas of high albedo. (Right) In an agricultural landscape, a patchwork of smaller forested and open areas exists, each with its characteristic albedo.

Recognition of global climate change as an environmental issue has drawn attention to the climatic impact of human activities. Most of this attention has focused on carbon dioxide emission via fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation. Human activities also yield releases of other greenhouse gases, such as methane (from rice cultivation, livestock, landfills, and other sources) and chlorofluorocarbons (from industrial sources). There is little doubt among climatologists that these greenhouse gases affect the radiation budget of Earth; the nature and magnitude of the climatic response are a subject of intense research activity. Paleoclimate records from tree rings, coral, and ice cores indicate a clear warming trend spanning the entire 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century. In fact, the 20th century was the warmest of the past 10 centuries, and the decade 2001–10 was the warmest decade since the beginning of modern instrumental record keeping. Many climatologists have pointed to this warming pattern as clear evidence of human-induced climate change resulting from the production of greenhouse gases. The global average surface temperature range for each year from 1861 to 2000 is shown by solid red bars, with the confidence range in the data for each year shown by thin whisker bars. The average change over time is shown by the solid curve. A second type of human impact, the conversion of vegetation by deforestation, afforestation, and agriculture, is receiving mounting attention as a further source of climate change. It is becoming increasingly clear that human impacts on vegetation cover can have local, regional, and even global effects on climate, due to changes in the sensible and latent heat flux to the atmosphere and the distribution of energy within the climate system. The extent to which these factors contribute to recent and ongoing climate change is an important, emerging area of study.

1203,"Comprehending the enormity of climate change is about as mind-bending as understanding the ultimate effect novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) will have on America and the world.

But a free, interactive tool made by artificial intelligence start-up HyperGiant helps put both global crises and their relationship to each other in perspective.

The ""ACES: A post Covid Emissions Simulator"" allows you to adjust pandemic-induced behaviors like the percentage of Americans who are working from home and the reduced amount of air travel to calculate how much carbon dioxide would be eliminated from the atmosphere if those changes were to be made permanent.

For instance, if 30% of the workforce is working from home, air traffic is reduced by 50% and people eat 15% less meat, according to the tool that eliminates 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide, which is 38% of the way towards the changes dictated by the Paris climate accord. (The United States signed the international environmental agreement in 2015 and pledged to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by about a quarter by 2030 from 2005 levels. In 2019, the U.S. officially withdrew from the commission.)

The tool also allows users to activate new technologies — like carbon capture, renewable power generation and revolutionary land management and agriculture strategies — to see what it would take to reach the emissions reductions necessary for carbon neutrality (where the net total carbon emissions equal zero, either through reducing your carbon emissions to zero or supporting enough carbon offset programs that your offsets to compensate for your emissions).

For example, if 30% of the workforce is working from home, air traffic is reduced by 50% and people eat 15% less meat (as established in the first portion of the interactive tool above), and then you also add the option of making all vehicles in the U.S. electric, that would eliminate 33 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2050, according to the simulator. (While that satisfies the Paris Agreement, it is not enough to ""reach carbon neutrality and avoid the worst effects of climate change,"" the simulator says.)

""One of the most difficult things about understanding climate change is understanding the size of the actual climate problem relative to the size of the potential solutions. If I tell you that we will not emit billions of tons of CO2 as a result of Covid-19, that sounds like a lot unless you know how to compare it to the size of the greenhouse gas crisis,"" HyperGiant climate advisor Noam Bar-Zemer tells CNBC Make It.

1058,"There is very strong evidence that humans are changing the climate with their actions, through the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.

A variety of factors, both natural and human, can influence the earth’s climate system. The world's climate varies naturally as a result of:
• the relationship between the ocean and the atmosphere
• changes in the earth's orbit
• changes in energy received from the sun

There is now strong evidence and broad-based agreement that major global warming cannot be explained just by natural changes. Those seen over recent years and those which are predicted over the next century, are thought to be mainly as a result of human behaviour.

The earth is surrounded by a layer of gases which act like the glass walls of a greenhouse: they let the sun’s rays enter, but stop much of the heat from leaving. This is a natural process, and it is this layer of ‘greenhouse gases’ (mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour) that keeps the planet warm enough for people and animals to live.

However, as we give out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect becomes stronger. More heat is trapped, and the earth's climate begins to change unnaturally.

In Northern Ireland, disruption to business, services and people's daily lives will increase if adverse changes occur.

An increased risk of flooding and coastal wear will put pressure on drainage, sewage, roads, water and habitat.

Increased temperature, increased pollution and poorer air quality may bring discomfort to the vulnerable and threaten species of animals and crops.

In Northern Ireland, the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions are:
• agriculture (27 per cent) - for example methane releases from livestock and manure, and other gases from chemical fertilisers
• transport (23 per cent) – there is a reliance on road use in Northern Ireland
• energy (17 per cent) - the use of fuel to generate energy (excluding transport)
• residential use of fuel (13 per cent) - the energy used in your home (the main use is heating)

Other things in people's homes contribute to climate change indirectly. Everything, from furniture to computers, from clothes to carpets, uses energy when it is produced and transported – and this causes emissions to be released. Reusing and recycling instead of throwing items away will mean less waste and less energy needed to make new items.

UK climate change projections, published in 2018 (UKCP18), set out a range of possible outcomes over the next century, based on different rates of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.

UKCP18 projects greater chance of hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters with more extreme weather and rising sea levels. The highest predicted releases for Northern Ireland shows that by:
• 2070 winters could be up to 3.9 °C warmer and summers could be up to 4.9°C hotter
• 2070 winters could be 25 per cent wetter and summers 38 per cent drier
• 2100 sea levels in Belfast could rise by up to 94cms

Changes you can make to your home

There are many things you can do to protect your home and yourself.

Make sure your home is well insulated to keep you warm in winter and cool in summer.

Cool your home naturally instead of using air conditioning, which can damage the environment:
• create a breeze by opening the windows at the highest and lowest points or on opposite sides of the house
• open windows at night and close windows, curtains or blinds during the day
• when replacing windows, ask about special coatings that reflect or absorb heat

More ways to keep cool
• fit blinds, shutters or awnings to provide shade and keep heat out
• paint outside walls and roofs a light colour to reflect heat
• replace carpets with solid flooring like stone or ceramic tiles which have a cooling effect and can lessen damage from a flood
• use household appliances at cooler times of day

Check if your home is at risk of flooding by viewing the Rivers Agency's Strategic Flood map. Consider ways to keep floodwater out, such as fitting air brick covers or installing a waterproof membrane on the outside walls. Also check the condition of your guttering and drains.

As the UK is likely to experience more droughts in summer months, saving water will become even more important.

Changes you can make to the outside of your home

If you have space outside your house, there are ways to keep your home cool and help prevent a flood.

Planting deciduous trees in your garden (particularly on the south-facing side) can shade your house in summer and allow sun to shine through in winter when the leaves have fallen.

You can buy root barrier membranes to protect a patio or house foundations from damage caused by roots.

Using less water in the garden will help to make the most of resources, especially during drier months.

Paving over gardens contributes to flooding, as hard surfaces like concrete or block paving take in less rainwater than lawns and plants.

Harder materials also store more heat from the sun and this can make a difference to temperatures, especially in urban areas.

If you need to create space for parking outside your house, use materials like lawn or gravel, which absorb rainwater, leaving just two paved tracks for the car. You can buy recycled gravel and paving that allows water to soak through.

You might need to get planning permission to alter your garden, particularly if you’re going to use materials that don’t let water soak through.

Grow plants and vegetation on rooftops, after properly preparing the surface with soil and root barriers.
• lower the temperature of buildings during summer and keep them warmer in winter

Placing potted shrubs and plants on flat roofs can also help.

You should ask the opinion of a structural engineer before taking on a green roof project for your house, to make sure it can support the extra weight without causing damage.",mainstream
782,"The idea of tipping points was introduced 20 years ago by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet and the Amazon rainforest, or extensive thawing of permafrost, as well as other key components of the climate system, are considered “tipping points” because they can cross critical thresholds, and then abruptly and irreversibly change. Just as a 200-year-old tree in a forest can remain standing after 20 blows from a sharp axe, the 21st blow may suddenly topple it.

Tipping points were once thought to be triggered only when global warming was above 5 degrees C (9 degrees C). But IPCC reports in the past year warn that they can happen between 1 degree C (1.8 degree C) and 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F). Every fractional rise in temperature increases the risk of triggering one of 30 major tipping points. With just 1 degree C of current warming, nine of these are now thought to be beginning to tip. Just as with that metaphorical 200-year-old tree, no one knows if the next axe strike—or degree—will topple it.

Even if countries act on their Paris climate agreement pledges to reduce emissions, warming will still rise more than 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F).

Global carbon emissions, which have risen year on year, need to fall 7.6 percent per year from now until 2030 to keep warming close to 1.5 degrees C (2.4 degrees F), according to a UN report released Nov 26.

The Earth’s climate and ecological systems are deeply intertwined. Powered by heat energy from the sun, the atmosphere, oceans, ice sheets, living organisms like forests, and the soils all affect, to a greater or lesser extent, the movement of that heat around the Earth's surface. The interactions among the elements of our global climate system mean a substantial change in one will affect others. As that 200-year-old tree falls after the 21st blow, it can crash into other trees, knocking them over in a domino-like effect.

What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay there

Scientists are warning that may be happening in the climate system: Different tipping points are beginning to slowly crash into each other. For example, the loss of Arctic sea ice in summers over the last 40 years means that there is more heat-absorbing open water and 40 percent less reflective ice. That is amplifying regional warming in the Arctic, leading to increased thawing of the arctic permafrost, in turn releasing more carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, adding to global warming.

A hotter Arctic has already triggered large-scale insect disturbances and an increase in fires, leading to a dieback of North American boreal forests. Those forests now may be releasing more carbon then they absorb.

Deeply interconnected systems can have planetary-scale impacts. Arctic warming, along with melting of Greenland’s ice sheet, is driving fresh water into the North Atlantic, which could have contributed to a recent 15 percent slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the Atlantic Ocean. Those ocean currents drive heat from the tropics and are responsible for the relative warmth of the Northern Hemisphere.

Many climate tipping points are more likely to be slow-motion events, like the collapse of Antarctic ice sheets that will play out over hundreds or even thousands of years, says Glen Peters, research director at Norway’s Center for International Climate.

“It is unclear when most of the tipping points will kick in,” says Peters, who was not involved in the Nature article.

It’s important to know that global temperatures aren’t driven by human emissions of carbon alone, says the report’s co-author Katherine Richardson, a professor of biological oceanography at the University of Copenhagen. The Earth’s natural systems such as forests, polar regions, and oceans also play major roles.

“We’ve got to pay attention to them,” says Richardson in an interview.",mainstream
738,"As this summer’s tourism season draws to a close, anyone in a half-sane society would choose this moment to stop going on far-flung vacations. That’s a hard thing for a travel writer to admit. After family and friends, travel is pretty much my favorite thing—not only my source of income, but an inexhaustible wellspring of curiosity, empathy, and wonder.

Read: This land is the only land there is

Yet optional travel is also a major contributor to ecocide. Last year, a University of Sydney study examined the environmental impact of the many activities involved in tourism—including transportation, shopping, and more—and found that it accounts for 8 percent of all global carbon emissions, far more than previously imagined. The 100,000 flights a day that now crisscross the skies pump almost as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as the 28 member states of the European Union combined. (In the United States, at least, roughly half of all airline trips are for “personal leisure purposes.”) In May, a landmark United Nations report into collapsing biodiversity found that humans have severely altered or destroyed about 75 percent of the Earth’s land; while human land use, including agriculture and ranching, was the greatest culprit, climate change was a significant factor as well. Moreover, while the report neglected to say so, the remaining 25 percent is hardly inviolate, as we scramble over one another to Instagram what idylls remain.

“Going someplace far away, we now know, is the biggest single action a private citizen can take to worsen climate change,” the journalist Andy Newman in wrote recently in The New York Times. “One seat on a flight from New York to Los Angeles effectively adds months worth of human-generated carbon emissions to the atmosphere. And yet we fly more and more.”

I certainly have. Since the turn of the millennium, I have amassed approximately 270,000 air miles, equivalent to flying around the planet almost a dozen times over. Based on the correlation between carbon-dioxide output and polar-ice melt established in the 2016 study cited in Newman’s article, this means that my flights alone have accounted for some 90 tons of carbon emissions, enough to melt about 260 square meters of polar sea ice. I have melted a tennis-court-size chunk of the Arctic all on my own.

Ignoring the impact of climate change is no longer an option, because I have seen its impact on four continents. In temperate London, where I live, global warming for now means that I didn’t wear a scarf last winter, and the daffodils opened early. Far more tangible are the symptoms of climate crisis I’ve witnessed abroad: shrinking glaciers in the Andes, record-breaking heat waves in southern Europe, the startling expansion of the Gobi desert. It has also become much harder to ignore the alarming testimonies of the people who live among them. Earlier this year, I received an email from a mountain guide I knew in Malawi. He was asking for help because his house had been washed away after Cyclone Idai barreled through southeastern Africa.",mainstream
89,"Of the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO ) is the most significant. Natural sources of atmospheric CO include outgassing from volcanoes, the combustion and natural decay of organic matter, and respiration by aerobic (oxygen-using) organisms. These sources are balanced, on average, by a set of physical, chemical, or biological processes, called “sinks,” that tend to remove CO from the atmosphere. Significant natural sinks include terrestrial vegetation, which takes up CO during the process of photosynthesis.

A number of oceanic processes also act as carbon sinks. One such process, called the “solubility pump,” involves the descent of surface seawater containing dissolved CO . Another process, the “biological pump,” involves the uptake of dissolved CO by marine vegetation and phytoplankton (small free-floating photosynthetic organisms) living in the upper ocean or by other marine organisms that use CO to build skeletons and other structures made of calcium carbonate (CaCO ). As these organisms expire and fall to the ocean floor, the carbon they contain is transported downward and eventually buried at depth. A long-term balance between these natural sources and sinks leads to the background, or natural, level of CO in the atmosphere.

In contrast, human activities increase atmospheric CO levels primarily through the burning of fossil fuels—principally oil and coal and secondarily natural gas, for use in transportation, heating, and the generation of electrical power—and through the production of cement. Other anthropogenic sources include the burning of forests and the clearing of land. Anthropogenic emissions currently account for the annual release of about 7 gigatons (7 billion tons) of carbon into the atmosphere. Anthropogenic emissions are equal to approximately 3 percent of the total emissions of CO by natural sources, and this amplified carbon load from human activities far exceeds the offsetting capacity of natural sinks (by perhaps as much as 2–3 gigatons per year).

CO consequently accumulated in the atmosphere at an average rate of 1.4 ppm per year between 1959 and 2006 and roughly 2.0 ppm per year between 2006 and 2018. Overall, this rate of accumulation has been linear (that is, uniform over time). However, certain current sinks, such as the oceans, could become sources in the future (see Carbon cycle feedbacks). This may lead to a situation in which the concentration of atmospheric CO builds at an exponential rate (that is, its rate of increase is also increasing).

The natural background level of carbon dioxide varies on timescales of millions of years because of slow changes in outgassing through volcanic activity. For example, roughly 100 million years ago, during the Cretaceous Period (145 million to 66 million years ago), CO concentrations appear to have been several times higher than they are today (perhaps close to 2,000 ppm). Over the past 700,000 years, CO concentrations have varied over a far smaller range (between roughly 180 and 300 ppm) in association with the same Earth orbital effects linked to the coming and going of the Pleistocene ice ages (see below Natural influences on climate). By the early 21st century, CO levels had reached 384 ppm, which is approximately 37 percent above the natural background level of roughly 280 ppm that existed at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Atmospheric CO levels continued to increase, and by 2018 they had reached 410 ppm. Such levels are believed to be the highest in at least 800,000 years according to ice core measurements and may be the highest in at least 5 million years according to other lines of evidence.

Radiative forcing caused by carbon dioxide varies in an approximately logarithmic fashion with the concentration of that gas in the atmosphere. The logarithmic relationship occurs as the result of a saturation effect wherein it becomes increasingly difficult, as CO concentrations increase, for additional CO molecules to further influence the “infrared window” (a certain narrow band of wavelengths in the infrared region that is not absorbed by atmospheric gases). The logarithmic relationship predicts that the surface warming potential will rise by roughly the same amount for each doubling of CO concentration. At current rates of fossil fuel use, a doubling of CO concentrations over preindustrial levels is expected to take place by the middle of the 21st century (when CO concentrations are projected to reach 560 ppm). A doubling of CO concentrations would represent an increase of roughly 4 watts per square metre of radiative forcing. Given typical estimates of “climate sensitivity” in the absence of any offsetting factors, this energy increase would lead to a warming of 2 to 5 °C (3.6 to 9 °F) over preindustrial times (see Feedback mechanisms and climate sensitivity). The total radiative forcing by anthropogenic CO emissions since the beginning of the industrial age is approximately 1.66 watts per square metre.",mainstream
175,"Whether it’s an unfamiliar dog growling outside your front door or a bus bearing down the street toward you, we are often motivated to avoid threats. Why is climate change so different? The recent United Nations report detailed that we will face serious consequences in the next 25 years if the nations of the world do not drastically act to reduce climate change now. There are many reasons that it’s difficult to motivate people to address climate change. It represents a trade-off between short-term and long-term benefits; it’s a nonlinear problem; the effects of climate change are distant from most people; and the future is always more uncertain than the present. However, there are ways to motivate yourself about the dire consequences: Bring the future mentally closer to yourself, confront the uncertainty head-on, and initiate a serious discussion about values among your peers.",mainstream
735,"Russia doesn't seem to care two bits about global warming, and it's not hard to see why. Most Russians would probably be happy if the country was a little warmer. Officials even joke that once climate change has run its course, people may start pouring into Siberia instead of trying to escape it. If the polar ice caps melt any further, Russia would be able to drill for oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean, where it's believed to have huge fossil-fuel reserves. For the rest of the planet, however, the picture is not so cheerful.

To say that Russia is hesitant about tackling climate change is putting it mildly. The last time the world tried to get the country's cooperation on the issue was in 1997, during negotiations for the Kyoto Protocol (the international treaty on limiting greenhouse-gas emissions). Because Russia is the world's third largest source of emissions after the U.S. and China, the accord would have failed without it. So the treaty was written in a way that would allow Russia to keep polluting as much as it wanted and grant the country billions of dollars in emissions allowances to sell to other countries that needed to meet their Kyoto commitments.

As a U.N. official who participated in the talks put it, ""Russia got the sweetest deal: free money, no restrictions."" But apparently even that wasn't enough. It took another seven years of painstaking negotiations  and promises from the West to help Russia join the World Trade Organization (WTO)  to get the country to ratify the deal.

How the world will persuade Russia to take an active part in the upcoming climate-change summit in Copenhagen on Dec. 2 remains to be seen. Scientists say this is the last real chance that global leaders have to deal with global warming before its effects become irreversible, and this time around there are few obvious carrots with which to bait the Kremlin. (Russia has since abandoned plans to join the WTO.) And Russia has already indicated that it is not putting a high priority on the talks. In June, President Dmitri Medvedev announced the country's emissions targets, which would effectively see Russia spew 30% more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by 2020 than it does today. ""We will not cut our development potential,"" Medvedev said at the time.

Then, at a preliminary round of climate talks in Copenhagen in late October, Russia sent an even more disappointing message. The head of the country's delegation, Mikhail Zelikhanov, a parliamentary deputy for Prime Minister Valdimir Putin's United Russia Party, questioned the basic premise of the fight against climate change. ""Scientific circles in Russia and elsewhere still do not have a united opinion on the causes of global warming,"" Zelikhanov told the group of lawmakers from 16 countries in the hall of the Danish parliament. He suggested that an international panel be created to study whether or not global warming was the result of human actions and whether it could be stopped by cutting pollution.

Zelikhanov is part of a growing chorus of global-warming skeptics in Russia. At a climate conference in St. Petersburg in 2007, Sergei Mironov, the speaker of the upper house of parliament, told experts that a process of ""global cooling"" was in fact taking place. As evidence, he cited the paintings of the 16th century Dutch masters, whose warmly colored landscapes, he said, showed that temperatures were indeed higher back then. And last month, the state-run Channel One television station aired a documentary called The History of a Deception: Global Warming, which claimed that a media conspiracy had invented the idea that pollution is to blame for climate change.

None of this bodes especially well for the success of the December summit. ""It will not be possible to finalize an agreement without the participation of Russia,"" says Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen, who is spearheading the negotiations. ""We will need to engage Russia in this dialogue."" This might be possible through concessions, though. Last month, Denmark put itself on Moscow's good side when it became the first country to approve the construction of Russia's Nord Stream gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea. On Nov. 2, Rasmussen received a sign of support from Putin on climate change, albeit a slightly vague one. ""Are we ready to support Danish efforts to promote the ideas of the post-Kyoto period? Yes, we are,"" Putin said at a joint press conference with Rasmussen.

A European official involved in the negotiations says Russia's fear of isolation may also compel it to cooperate. With the U.S. and China taking the lead in the climate-change summit and Brazil and India playing an active role, Russia would be the largest polluter and the only major power not helping to solve the crisis. ""They won't want to be the bad guy,"" says the official, who spoke last month in Copenhagen on condition of anonymity.

But another member of the Russian delegation at the October talks left little room for optimism. Elena Chistyakova, chief adviser to the parliament's foreign affairs committee, says Russia may sign the treaty  and that's it. ""[Russia] will drag out the ratification as long as they can. And if they ratify it, then they'll drag out the implementation,"" she says. ""There's just no political will.""

686,"For anyone planning to drink their way through the impending climate catastrophe, science has some bad news.

According to a new study by US-based experts, global warming of just two degrees Celsius (3.6 Farenheit) could see the world's wine-producing regions shrink by more than half.

That's the temperature goal laid out in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.

With 4C of warming, 85 percent of current wine-producing land would be unable to produce good vintages.

""In some ways, wine is like the canary in the coal mine for climate change impacts on agriculture, because these grapes are so climate-sensitive,"" said Benjamin Cook, from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Cook and his colleagues focused on 11 varieties of wine grape including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Grenache, Merlot and Sauvignon Blanc.

They used archives of each grape variety to model when each would ripen in wine growing regions around the world under three temperature scenarios: 0C, 2C, and 4C warmer than pre-industrial averages.

With 2C of warming and no change in the way wine is processed, 56 percent of established regions were rendered unsuitable for producing wine grapes in the models.

But there may be a ray of hope for despairing connoisseurs: diversity.

If winegrowers switch up their varieties, replacing grapes that thrive in cooler temperatures with warm-weather loving ones, the loss of wine-growing regions at 2C of warming would roughly halve.

Perhaps controversially, the study's authors suggested that wine-growers in France's famed Burgundy region could replace the ubiquitous Pinot Noir with southern interloper Grenache.

They acknowledged that such change could come with a side serving of legal, cultural and financial challenges.

""That's a big hurdle in some regions that have grown the same varieties for hundreds and hundreds of years, and they need consumers who are willing to accept different varieties from their favourite regions,"" said co-author Elizabeth Wolkovich from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.",mainstream

390,"This section brings together statistics from various domains in an easily accessible and structured way, to help you find data to better understand, analyse and monitor climate change.

The direct impacts which we experience include an increase in the global temperature, rising sea levels and more extreme weather conditions. These impacts have subsequent wide-ranging effects on ecosystems, the economy, society and human health. We have to deal with the consequences while trying to counter the causes of climate change. Climate change-related statistics can help us to understand this whole process better.

Climate change refers to a change in climate patterns due to human activities, going beyond the natural variability in the climate. This is caused by greenhouse gases emitted into our atmosphere. Among the drivers of these emissions are the burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes, livestock farming, and waste treatment.

These are statistics from a wide range of domains, such as environmental, social and economic statistics, that tell you more about issues related to climate change. They include statistics on greenhouse gas emissions, activities that cause and reduce emissions, and the impact of climate change and how we adapt to it. For example, statistics on agricultural production, waste generation, and energy use can be used to estimate emissions.

What information can I find here?

In this section, you will find statistics on the drivers, emissions, impacts as well as mitigation and adaptation measures related to climate change.
• Drivers are human activities that cause climate change. They include economic activities, such as electricity production or cutting down trees, but also leisure activities, such as car journeys.
• Emissions related to climate change are emissions of greenhouse gases, which are so named because they trap heat in our atmosphere.
• Climate change mitigation refers to activities undertaken to reduce or offset GHG emissions, such as increasing carbon sinks.
• Climate change adaptation includes specific actions to help communities and ecosystems better cope with, or even benefit from, climate change.

What role do statistics play in fighting climate change?

The availability of high quality information is essential for monitoring progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as for analysing the drivers, impacts and adaptation to climate change. It is essential to continually monitor and report these data to keep track of progress towards the goals set out in European and international climate policies.

International recommendations published by the Conference of European Statisticians call for improvements to existing statistics relevant to climate change analysis and access to them (see the Recommendations on Climate Change-Related Statistics).

Why is there more than one dataset with greenhouse gas emissions?

Monitoring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is at the heart of efforts to tackle climate change. We need to know how much we emit and to keep track of it over time, to see whether efforts to reduce GHG emissions are paying off. However, different methods and formats are used for different purposes to produce complementary emission statistics. You can find more information about this on the 'Data' page.",mainstream

If there’s one environmental-advocacy organization that needs no introduction, it’s Greenpeace. The NGO has been around for much longer than “climate change” has been a commonplace phrase, lobbying heads of states and congresses around the world, and protesting for environmental causes on the open seas, since 1971. Its actions have received the scorn of the fossil-fuel industry, the nuclear industry, the whaling industry, many other industries, and those industries’ state allies. (The French government even admitted that its external intelligence agency, the General Directorate for External Security, used explosives to sink the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior in the Port of Aukland in 1985.)

Annie Leonard is the executive director of Greenpeace USA (the organization has 55 offices worldwide). Climate change is a major focus of her advocacy. “What am I personally doing about climate change? A lot of things, I’ll tell you. On an individual level, and also on a broader society-wide level, because that’s where we really see the impacts,” says Leonard.

“One of the things I’m doing is really investing in community,” says Leonard. She explains by fostering a strong sense of community with your immediate neighbors, you can better fight climate change. They share things to reduce their carbon footprints, for example, by borrowing ingredients from neighbors when baking a cake, instead of driving to the store for the one egg needed. Having a strong community “also helps build support and meaning and the resilience and security that we’re going to need to get through the climate crisis together, just like we’re seeing strong communities right now helping people get through the COVID crisis.”

Leonard also argues it’s important to focus on solutions, not just problems, to maintain a positive and achievable outlook on climate change. She explains, “People tell us, ‘Oh, that’s idealistic, you’re asking for unicorns.’ If you’ve seen solutions in action, you know that is not true. So it helps to make our commitment unshakeable.”

On a personal level, Leonard likes to grow her own vegetables, ride a bicycle, and rarely use disposable plastics, but maintains that “those aren’t going to scale at the level we need to drive broad, broad change.… Those are a great place to start, but a terrible place to stop.”

So where do we stop? “The single most important thing that we all have to do is stop burning fossil-fuels,” including oil, coal, and gas, which Leonard points to as the leading culprit for climate change. She also advocates for diverting public subsidies away from these industries, and to renewable energy (while taking care of communities and workers with a “just transition”). When it comes to fossil fuels: “No new permits, no new ports, no new pipelines.”

Leonard says the most important thing for individuals is to take action: “Find an organization or campaign that feels like a good fit for you. There’s so many to choose from. And contact them and ask how you can help. If you want to join Greenpeace, we’d love to have you involved.”",mainstream
1162,"Farmers in the Netherlands are staging a new revolt against restrictions on livestock related to climate change, with one telling the state broadcaster how he is sick of being lectured about nature by middle class city dwellers “who have two plants on their balcony.”

The demonstrations began earlier this month after the Dutch government announced that Dutch livestock farming should be slashed by up to 50% to meet commitments on reducing nitrogen emissions.

Farmers were irate after learning that the same restrictions would not apply to the aviation industry.

Demonstrators clogged up major roads and highways once again today, causing traffic jams across the entire country and leading to the Dutch army being called out.

“Last year you didn’t hear anything about nitrogen, and now suddenly it’s a mortal question,” farmer Micha Bouwer of the Farmers Defence Force told state broadcaster NOS. “These are all people in the city who have two plants on their balcony and say ‘nature is suffering’.”

Farmers also argue that their crucial role in food production is being overlooked and that they are being blamed for climate change.

Court rulings recently made clear that the Dutch government must cut greenhouse gas emissions “in order to protect the life and family life of citizens” in the country.

The protest once again underscores how punitive restrictions, bureaucracy and taxes related to climate change hysteria are impacting working class and lower middle class people.

321,"Action on climate change has been stymied by politics, lobbying by energy companies and the natural pace of scientific research — but one of the most significant barriers is our own minds.

Think about how every town seems to have a traffic intersection that’s needlessly dangerous. No matter how many times you think to yourself, “They should really put in a stoplight here,” you don’t call the proper authorities. (You’re already late for work, and it feels like someone else’s problem to solve.)

Our mental responses to global warming and climate change follow a similar script. What needs to be done is clear enough — stop greenhouse gases from occupying the atmosphere — and yet progress moves at a snail’s pace. Three decades passed between the first report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the international community’s pledge for action through the Paris climate accords.

It took another two years for these governments to decide — at the COP24 conference in Poland — on how to keep each other accountable. And keep in mind, the Paris agreement still carries no legal powers of enforcement.

Part of the reason it takes us so long to act is because the human brain has spent nearly 200,000 years focused on the present. “Find food. Make shelter. Mate!” We only began to contemplate time, and by extension the future, within the last few hundred years.

Making the future tangible is only one of the psychological barriers that have made climate change into an elusive problem — one for which we must cut global carbon emissions in half within the next 12 years to prevent serious devastation.

Our minds — regardless of one’s political or socioeconomic status — are constantly looking for ways to tell ourselves that business as usual is OK. News of disappearing glaciers fails to inspire serious change because of this cognitive shield — indeed certain efforts to educate only harden partisanship on the issue.

But it’s still possible to train your brain to get over these hurdles. Here’s how.

Apathy and discounting (why news stories about polar bears don’t inspire action)

Overcoming these hurdles relies on the careful intersection of three key dimensions — almost like trying a Rubik’s Cube, said Robert Gifford, an environmental psychologist at the University of Victoria in British Columbia.

The first dimension centers on finding the best way to change a person’s behaviors toward the environment.

To do that, you need to tap into another dimension: a person’s demographics — how much money they make or where they live.

Finally, there are what Gifford calls “dragons of inaction” — the specific cognitive barriers that dominate someone’s view of climate change.

“The perception of not having control over the situation is certainly one of the biggest” barriers, Gifford said.

Whenever the NewsHour covers climate change, the most common responses we get from those who don’t believe that humans influence climate change point to the ice ages. They cite how the Earth has experienced natural cycles, between extreme cold and heat, for millennia.

These beliefs are known as nature-benign worldviews, because they suggest the planet is impervious to carbon pollution or any activity performed by Earth’s creatures — even it is done by billions of them, repeatedly in developed countries, for more than a century.

Research shows some deniers may espouse these opinions because they have a personal stake — whether it’s stock investments in fossil fuel companies or they simply enjoy a drive in their gas-powered car.

“But these people are honestly ignoring the fact that the temperature is rising at a rate beyond anything that anybody’s seen for thousands of years,” Gifford said. “It’s pretty clear that it’s not a natural cycle.”

Cognitive dissonance, the mental discomfort created by holding more than one conflicting belief at once, plays a part in these dismissals too, Gifford said.

No one wants to believe their daily activities — from switching on a light to checking your phone to washing your hair to going to work — are responsible for a global disaster that has already turned millions of people into climate refugees and killed scores of others.

So people change their minds about the issue rather than changing their habits because it’s an easier way to cope, Gifford said.

Gifford’s lab has found this cognitive tension runs alongside another barrier known as discounting, wherein people undervalue climate change because its hazards don’t feel immediate or nearby. When they surveyed 3,200 people across 18 nations, they found a majority — those from 15 countries — believed incorrectly that climate change wasn’t a local problem.

Spatial discounting helps explain why people maintain the status quo — or become more polarized — even if their news feeds are swamped by viral stories of giant icebergs breaking off Antarctica, or polar bears swimming until they drown.

If the message lacks personal or local relevance, research shows that people will be less engaged.

Ignorance (why people don’t know how to live environmentally)

Another of these “dragons of inaction” is ignorance — not in a negative sense, but rather a lack of information. People often recognize that climate change is bad but don’t know quite what to do about it in their own lives.

For instance, even if many people know that the average American emits about 17 tons of carbon every year, they don’t realize half of those emissions could be eliminated with simple fixes.

“The average house has air leakage equivalent to a small window being open all year round,” said Richard Heede, co-founder and co-director of the Climate Accountability Institute. “If people can caulk these leaky areas, it would help reduce cold infiltration and lower heating bills.”

Heating and cooling account for 53 percent of household emissions, which can be cut by switching to energy-efficient appliances or brushing your teeth with cold instead of hot water.

“Lower the water heater temperature from the normal preset of 140 degrees Fahrenheit to 120,” Heede said. “That’s easy enough, and it prevents scalding by friends and visitors.”

Washing clothes in cold water can save up to 15 pounds of carbon emissions per load, depending on your washing machine and your energy supplier.

Awareness (why so few are driving electric cars)

Experts view the abandonment of gas-burning vehicles as essential to meeting climate goals. In 2014, nearly a quarter of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions were created by transportation, a sector that accounts for 70 percent of U.S. petroleum consumption, most of which — 99 percent — is used by cars, trucks and airplanes. In the U.S., transportation is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions.

Yet even though every major automaker produces electric or hybrid models, most lack mainstream brand recognition. Car dealerships — even in California, which leads the nation in electric cars — express an annoyance toward selling green vehicles.

Go ahead, name an electric car brand. Let me guess: You said Tesla.

Consumers in Canada and the U.S. are “aware that electric vehicles exist as a thing, but don’t understand anything beyond that,” said Jonn Axsen, who directs the Sustainable Transportation Action Research Team at Simon Fraser University. “We find this repeatedly in our in our survey work.”

When his lab examined a survey of 1,700 new car buyers in Canada, they learned only 18 percent knew of a nearby electric car charging station. A second study found a mere 22 percent reported being familiar with how plug-in cars work. Buyers said these things dissuaded them from purchasing electric vehicles.

But in what might be the biggest misconception about the transition to electric vehicles, many respondents assumed that they need abundant access to charging stations before they can invest in an electric car to help the climate, Axsen said.

That’s because most folks are confused about the difference between plug-in hybrid vehicles, which can be plugged in or use gasoline, and pure electric vehicles, Axsen said. “While niche groups of enthusiasts want to go pure electric, that’s proven to be a small share of the market.”

Once a town or community becomes aware of plug-in hybrids and how they operate, Axsen’s group found, there is far more — about 75 percent — expressed demand for that type of vehicle. Consumers can charge them at home for daily city commutes, but still go on unplanned road trips with the gasoline engine.

Contrary to concerns about how far you can drive, “your range is even longer than a conventional vehicle because you have both the battery and the inefficient gasoline engine to work with,” Axsen said.

On the long road to decarbonizing vehicles, the IPCC views hybrid vehicles as “instrumental,” given that transportation emission must drop by 15 to 30 percent in the coming decades to stop the calamity of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.

Delusions and procrastination (why politicians are taking so long to act)

Washington, D.C., the city proper, is the definition of a liberal stronghold. The District has elected a Democrat in every mayoral race since 1961 and has never voted in favor of a Republican president in its history. The nation’s capital is also a car city, with more than 310,000 registered vehicles. That’s about 5,000 vehicles per square mile, which rivals megacities like New York (7,200); it’s three times as congested as Los Angeles (1,700).

Despite its liberal core, only 1 percent of new vehicles on D.C. streets were electric in 2016, a lower percentage than in Detroit and Salt Lake City. Its total fleet of electric vehicles falls outside the top-10 for U.S. cities.

So how can a government like D.C.’s, which often touts its leadership on energy efficiency, not take steps to boost the city’s supply of electric vehicles?

One of Axsen’s colleague’s at Simon Fraser University — Mark Jaccard — says it happens because policymakers are deluding themselves.

Even after politicians become convinced that climate change matters, they set ineffective policy goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — a basic premise that Axsen said other scholars have noticed for decades.

“Time after time, [lawmakers] either put in no effective policies or very few effective policies — where there is no evidence that those policies will get anywhere near their targets,” Axsen said. “It has been happening for decades, and it is everywhere.”

He cites the slow national adoption of the zero-emission vehicle mandate as the starkest example. This policy, which was first implemented in California in 1990, requires automakers to ensure that a certain number of electric vehicles are on the road.

“The beauty, at least from a public policy perspective, is that it puts the onus on automakers,” Axsen said. “When carmakers are required to make, develop, market and sell electric vehicles, then they will channel their resources into doing that,” and it has a snowball effect.

It usually goes like this: Automakers begin swapping subsidies, which lower prices for consumers. These backroom deals also reduce the number of government-funded incentives — tax credits — needed to promote electric vehicle adoption. Such incentives can become prohibitively expensive for a city and its citizens as the market grows.

More money going into research and development to bring the cost down for batteries eventually means “a wider range of makes and models of electric vehicles and more marketing efforts in order to make people aware of the different vehicles,” Axsen said.

Research shows that the zero-emission vehicle programs could nearly eliminate petroleum use in passenger vehicles by 2050 in the U.S., yet only nine states have followed California’s lead in 30 years. Automakers and their lobbyists argue that the mandate places too high a burden on vehicle manufacturers. D.C.’s landmark climate bill, which would transition the city to 100 percent renewable energy, does not include a plan for reaching zero emissions from vehicles.

The political reluctance around the zero-emission vehicle mandate mirrors what happened with solar energy, which only ballooned in the last decade thanks in part to government support.

Carbon capture and storage technology, which sucks carbon dioxide out of the sky, has also faced a slow rollout.

As of 2018, there are 18 large-scale carbon capture facilities operating in the world, up from a tally of 17 the year before.

Akshat Rathi, who has thoroughly covered this issue for Quartz, reports that the world needs at least 200 of these facilities by 2025 to hit zero emissions. Meanwhile, there are 500 coal plants currently under construction worldwide, and another 1,000 planned for the near future.

Based on every climate scenario studied by the IPCC, the Earth cannot stop the coming devastation wrought by global warming without carbon capture and storage; the global dearth of carbon capture continues to threaten the Paris accords emissions targets for 2030.

Internal motivation (why you can still make a difference)

Every expert interviewed for this story said that if people want to stop this slow, collective demise by a thousand political half-steps, the best weapon is you.

People tend to mold their behaviors around what they already favor. If you favor patriotism, you’ll attend parades. If you favor the outdoors, you’ll go camping or hunting.

So how we internally frame our discussions about climate change is one of the keys to motivating action, Gifford said. (Alternatively, if you give people outside incentives to do the right thing environmentally, the behavior stops pretty much when the incentive stops.)

“The goal is trying to get people to have a green identity, an intrinsic motivation instead of an extrinsic motivation,” Gifford said.

One way to shape environmental attitudes is to explain how climate change will directly affect a person’s lifestyle, such as by threatening national security or national parks, he said.

“Another messaging strategy that works across the board is not telling people that they’re going to have to sacrifice,” Gifford said. “Research shows that pro-environment messages stick best when you tell people that they can be a hero by helping others.”

Heede echoed this sentiment, pointing to massive efforts by investors toward green energy. One student-inspired campaign has pledged to divest $6 trillion from fossil fuels since 2011, and global investments in clean energy have exceeded $200 billion for the last eight years.

Heede said this investor pressure has led most oil and gas companies to pledge reductions in carbon emissions — at least with their field operations. Shell has even developed a global plan for reaching zero emissions, though it calls on increases in coal, natural gas and oil for decades.

Grassroots efforts have also spawned political pressure and movements like the Green New Deal in the House of Representatives.

“Increasingly shareholders are more activist with respect to climate,” Heede said. But you don’t have to be a millionaire to make a difference. “Consumers have a lot of power to adjust their spending habits, what they invest then and what their concerns are. We vote with our dollars.”",mainstream
904,"Changes in the greenhouse gas concentrations and other drivers alter the global climate and bring about myriad human health consequences. Environmental consequences of climate change, such as extreme heat waves, rising sea-levels, changes in precipitation resulting in flooding and droughts, intense hurricanes, and degraded air quality, affect directly and indirectly the physical, social, and psychological health of humans. For instance, changes in precipitation are creating changes in the availability and quantity of water, as well as resulting in extreme weather events such as intense hurricanes and flooding. Climate change can be a driver of disease migration, as well as exacerbate health effects resulting from the release of toxic air pollutants in vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with asthma or cardiovascular disease.

Certain adverse health effects can be minimized or avoided with sound mitigation and adaptation strategies. Strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change can prevent illness and death in people now, while also protecting the environment and health of future generations. Mitigation refers to actions being taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to enhance the sinks that trap or remove carbon from the atmosphere. Adaptation refers to actions being taken to lessen the impact on health and the environment due to changes that cannot be prevented through mitigation. Appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies will positively affect both climate change and the environment, and thereby positively affect human health. Some adaptation activities will directly improve human health through changes in our public health and health care infrastructure.

It is critical that adaptation and mitigation decisions and policies be developed with a sound basis in the best current science on climate change and its effects. There are gaps in our understanding of the relationship between climate change, the environment, and human health. In its 2010 report, A Human Health Perspective on Climate Change (Full Report) (4MB), the NIEHS-led Interagency Working Group on Climate Change and Health identified major research areas that need to be further explored and understood.

447,"The world needs to prepare for a surge in refugees with potentially millions of people being driven from their homes by the impact of climate change, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said on Tuesday.

Speaking to Reuters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, UN Commissioner Filippo Grandi said a UN ruling this week meant those fleeing as a result of climate change had to be treated by recipient countries as refugees, with broad implications for governments.
• At least 12 people die as boat sinks off Greek island of Paxi
• Nearly 1,000 migrants 'returned to Libya' this year

The UN Human Rights Committee made the landmark ruling on Monday in relation to refugee-status applicant Ioane Teitiota, a man from the Pacific nation of Kiribati who brought a case against New Zealand after authorities denied his claim of asylum.

""The ruling says if you have an immediate threat to your life due to climate change, due to the climate emergency, and if you cross the border and go to another country, you should not be sent back because you would be at risk of your life, just like in a war or in a situation of persecution,"" Grandi said.

""We must be prepared for a large surge of people moving against their will,"" he said. ""I wouldn't venture to talk about specific numbers. It's too speculative, but certainly we're talking about millions here.""

Potential drivers of migration include wildfires like those seen in Australia, rising sea levels affecting low-lying islands, the destruction of crops and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa, and floods worldwide, including in parts of the developed world.

For most of its 70 years, UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, has worked to assist those fleeing poorer countries as a result of conflict. But climate change is more indiscriminate, meaning richer countries may become a rising source of refugees.

""It is further proof that refugee movements and the broader issue of migration of populations ... is a global challenge that cannot be confined to a few countries,"" said Grandi.

The UNHCR's budget has risen from $1bn a year in the early 1990s to $8.6bn in 2019 as conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have forced civilians to flee, and the agency now assists more than 70 million forcibly displaced people globally.

Turkey is the largest recipient of this aid, with more than four million refugees and asylum seekers, the vast majority from Syria. This has strained Turkey's public finances and led President Tayyip Erdogan to demand more assistance from Europe.

Last November, Erdogan threatened to open the door for Syrian refugees to head to Europe unless the European Union stepped up. He is now calling for the ""resettlement"" of up to one million Syrians in the north of their homeland.

Grandi said European governments needed to think hard about solutions to the migrant crisis that has affected them since 2015 - but also show more understanding of Turkey's situation.

""We must recognise that for the past several years [Turkey] has been hosting the largest refugee population in the world,"" he said. ""There's a lot of political talk. I concentrate on the substance of this, which is 'let's strengthen Turkey's ability to host refugees until they can go back safely, voluntarily to their countries'.""",mainstream
1005,"What is the Doomsday Clock?

Doomsday is one of those evocative words that paint a very vivid picture. As we define doomsday: “the day of the Last Judgment, at the end of the world; nuclear destruction of the world; given to or marked by forebodings or predictions of impending calamity; especially concerned with or predicting future universal destruction.” As you can see, it’s about as bottom-line as it can get. Other words associated with doomsday are just as expressive, like Armageddon and apocalypse.

With that said, the “Doomsday Clock” has (unfortunately) been in the news of late. Its hands have been moved up to just 100 seconds to midnight, which metaphorically means that the planet is about as close to global disaster as it ever has been. (Midnight = we’re in serious trouble.) The very fact that such a thing has existed for so long means that mankind has teetered on the precipice of disaster for quite awhile now. So, what exactly is this thing, and how did it gain this status as a symbol of our collective impending doom?

The Doomsday Clock (there is no physical clock, BTW) is run by a group of people who produce an academic journal called the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The clock was created in 1947 just after humanity had entered the Nuclear Age after the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. (That year, the bulletin was first formed by a group of scientists and engineers who participated in the Manhattan Project, which developed those weapons.) Their symbolic clock was first set at seven minutes to midnight.

Why is the Doomsday Clock now set at 100 seconds?

In 2018, the clock was notably moved to two minutes to midnight for the first time in its history. Now, 2020 marks another milestone: the clock has been set at 100 seconds, just under two minutes, to metaphorical doomsday.

According to official statement from the Bullet of the Atomic Scientists:

The statement specifically cites international retreat from arms control agreements, an insufficient global response to an increasingly threatened environment, and the growing dangers of information warfare and other disruptive technologies, such as deepfakes.

Another notable change to the time on the clock was when it advanced 30 seconds in 2017. The furthest it has been from midnight was 17 minutes back in 1991, as the Soviet Union fell apart. It’s been reset a total of 23 times (and counting) since 1947.

How often does the clock change?

The Bulletin group is not in the prognostication business where ultimate cataclysm is concerned. The academics, including many Nobel Laureates, that run the Clock don’t update it in real time. They meet twice a year to assess world events, not forecasting events but tracking data (e.g., how many nuclear weapons there are in the world, the level of carbon dioxide in the environment) and assessing the response to these threats (e.g., citizen efforts, global agreements).

But, for as doom-and-gloom as the Doomsday Clock can be, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists always suggests meaningful action. As they conclude in their 2020 statement:",mainstream
461,"The ongoing climate crisis is on course to destroy half the world's sandy beaches by the end of the century, a new study warns.

Sandy shorelines of many high-population areas and tourist hot-spots are threatened by erosion, climate change and surging sea levels.

At-risk areas include Surfers' Paradise in Queensland, St Tropez, Honolulu, Copacabana, the Costa del Sol and Weymouth.

But researchers offer a glimmer of hope and believe a moderate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could prevent 40 per cent of the predicted loss.

Researchers from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in Ispra in northern Italy analysed 30 years worth of satellite images of sandy beaches.

Study author Dr Michalis Vousdoukas, who led the research, said: 'The results indicate around 50 per cent of the world's sandy beaches are at risk of severe erosion.

'Half of the world's beaches could disappear by the end of the century under current trends of climate change and sea level rise.

'The situation can become more critical for small communities highly reliant on tourism.'

Sandy beaches occupy more than a third of the global coastline and are valuable in many ways as they provide economic income via recreation and tourism.

They are also very environmentally valuable as they provide natural protection from storms and cyclones.

However, erosion, sea level rises and changing weather threaten the coast's infrastructure and people.

Some countries will be worse hit than others, with The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau facing the loss of over 60 per cent of their white sandy beaches.

Overall, Australia would be worst hit with around 7,500 miles (12,000 km ) of beach at risk.

Canada, Chile, Mexico, China and the United States would also be greatly affected.

'Between a quarter and a half of the UK's sandy beaches will retreat by more than a hundred metres over the next century, depending on how rapidly the polar ice sheets melt,' according to Professor Andrew Shepherd, Director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds.

The researchers used computer modelling systems to forecast how the beaches, in their currently depleted state, would deteriorate as climate change worsens.

Two eventualities of 'representative concentration pathways (RCP)' for global warming were predicted, each representing a future of varying severity.

RCP8.5 is the highest level of projected greenhouse gas emissions and RCP4.5 features less intense emissions that span over a long period of time.

Researchers looked at how human activity and geological processes causes shoreline retreat as well as the damage caused by storms to make their findings.

Dr Suzana Ilic at Lancaster University said: 'This new research shows that about 30 per cent and 60 per cent of low lying areas fronted by sandy beaches will be seriously threatened by erosion, due to climate change under the high emission of greenhouse gases by the middle and the end of the 21st century respectively.'

Moderate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may prevent 40 per cent of this loss, the study authors suggest.

Dr Ilic, who was not involved in the study, added: 'It is encouraging to see that reducing emissions from a high to moderate level will result in a reduction of the projected shoreline retreat of 22 per cent by 2050 and 40 per cent by 2100.'

254,"We all know that there is a hole in the ozone layer and that the hole itself is a serious issue but perhaps it’s slowly getting better. According to a recent study, we’re seeing real differences.

This specific study seems to show that the Montreal Protocol is in itself quite effective. For this study researchers used computer simulations to detect just where certain patterns of wind changes had come from. This in regard to natural variability or human-caused factors as the Metro put it.

The abstract for this study goes as follows:

Observations show robust near-surface trends in Southern Hemisphere tropospheric circulation towards the end of the twentieth century, including a poleward shift in the mid-latitude jet1,2, a positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode1,3,4,5,6 and an expansion of the Hadley cell7,8. It has been established that these trends were driven by ozone depletion in the Antarctic stratosphere due to emissions of ozone-depleting substances9,10,11. Here we show that these widely reported circulation trends paused, or slightly reversed, around the year 2000. Using a pattern-based detection and attribution analysis of atmospheric zonal wind, we show that the pause in circulation trends is forced by human activities, and has not occurred owing only to internal or natural variability of the climate system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that stratospheric ozone recovery, resulting from the Montreal Protocol, is the key driver of the pause. Because pre-2000 circulation trends have affected precipitation12,13,14, and potentially ocean circulation and salinity15,16,17, we anticipate that a pause in these trends will have wider impacts on the Earth system. Signatures of the effects of the Montreal Protocol and the associated stratospheric ozone recovery might therefore manifest, or have already manifested, in other aspects of the Earth system.

While we have noticed a trend showing the hole improving, it does seem things may end up becoming worse in the coming years as emissions are getting higher instead of lower. Right now we’re seeing a dip in air pollution because of the virus but who knows how long that in itself will last? However, if the trend continues as it has been the ozone above the northern hemisphere might be fully recovered by the mid-2030s or so the Guardian has reported in the past.

Antara Banerjee who worked on this study told The Independent as follows on these findings:

“We found signs of climate changes in the southern hemisphere, specifically in the air circulation patterns.”

“The change was shown that these changing air circulation patterns were due to the shrinking ozone hole following the implementation of the Montreal Protocol.”

“The jet stream in the southern hemisphere was gradually shifting towards the south pole in the last decades of the 20th century due to ozone depletion.”

“Our study found that movement has stopped since 2000 and might even be reversing. The pause in movement began around the same time that th ozone hole started to recover.”

“The emissions of ozone-depleting substances that were responsible for the ozone hole – the CFCs from spray cans and refrigerants – started to decline around 2000, thanks to the Montreal Protocol.”

“It’s not just ozone that affects the jet stream – CO2 also has an effect. What we are seeing is that there is a ‘tug-of-war’ between ozone recovery, which pulls the jet stream one way (to the North), and rising CO2, which pulls the other way (to the South).”

“We are seeing the pause in the shifting jet stream because these two forces are currently in balance. That might change in the future when ozone has fully recovered and CO2 carries on pushing it south.”

Overall the findings these researchers managed to gain were quite positive and are great news for all of us. For more information on this please check out the video below. While only time will tell, this could be a very huge step in the right direction.",conspiracy
85,"­The dramatic imagery of global warming frightens people. Melting glaciers, fre­ak storms and stranded polar bears -- the mascots of climate change -- show how quickly and drastically greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are changing our planet. Such graphic examples, combined with the rising price of energy, drive people to want to reduce consumption and lower their personal shares of global emissions. But behind the emotional front of climate change lies a developing framework of economic solutions to the problem. Two major market-based options exist, and politicians around the world have largely settled on carbon trading over its rival, carbon tax, as the chosen method to regulate GHG emissions.

Carbon trading, sometimes called emissions trading, is a market-based tool to limit GHG. The carbon market trades emissions under cap-and-trade schemes or with credits that pay for or offset GHG reductions.

Cap-and-trade schemes are the most popular way to regulate carbon dioxide (CO2) and other emissions. The scheme's governing body begins by setting a cap on allowable emissions. It then distributes or auctions off emissions allowances that total the cap. Member firms that do not have enough allowances to cover their emissions must either make reductions or buy another firm's spare credits. Members with extra allowances can sell them or bank them for future use. Cap-and-trade schemes can be either mandatory or voluntary.

A successful cap-and-trade scheme relies on a strict but feasible cap that decreases emissions over time. If the cap is set too high, an excess of emissions will enter the atmosphere and the scheme will have no effect on the environment. A high cap can also drive down the value of allowances, causing losses in firms that have reduced their emissions and banked credits. If the cap is set too low, allowances are scarce and overpriced. Some cap and trade schemes have safety valves to keep the value of allowances within a certain range. If the price of allowances gets too high, the scheme's governing body will release additional credits to stabilize the price. The price of allowances is usually a function of supply and demand.

Credits are similar to carbon offsets except that they're often used in conjun­ction with cap-and-trade schemes. Firms that wish to reduce below target may fund preapproved emissions reduction projects at other sites or even in other countries.",mainstream
846,"Even now that most of the world has acknowledged that climate change is real and caused by humans, combating it has proved daunting. Why? There are five features that combine to make global warming a more vexing environmental crisis than any we have faced before.

First, the pollutants that contribute to it are global pollutants, ones that do their damage no matter where on earth they are released. Past pollutants — such as sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, or nitrogen oxides, which are a precursor to smog — are local pollutants, which do most of their damage near where they are released. Elected officials are much more likely to enact measures to curtail local pollutants, because the voters who elect them are directly affected by the pollution. With global pollutants, much of the damage is felt far away, and moreover, they may not be something an elected official can control through local action.

The second complicating feature of climate change pollutants is that much of their damage is in the future. The electorate and their public officials have less reason to pass measures that would cost money and cause inconvenience now, when the most severe damage will accrue to some distant and unknowable future.

The third issue is that the pollutants producing climate change can’t be directly linked to a smoking gun. Whereas nitrogen oxide emissions directly created smog, which was easily seen, climate change pollutants lead to more frequent bad events, but these events also can and do occur naturally. We can chart, over time, that hurricanes are getting wetter and more damaging or that drought cycles last longer, but those observations are easily dismissed by those who wish to downplay the problem, since weather has always been variable. Rising average temperatures too can be ignored, because there have always been record-setting days and heat waves.

The fourth feature that makes climate change particularly daunting is that developing countries contribute a large share of the pollution that drives it. This is important for several reasons. It is difficult for developed nations to make the case that the same technologies that made their own growth possible should now be denied to the countries coming behind them. And it is hard for policy makers in developing countries to justify incurring the costs of reducing global pollutants when their citizens still struggle with getting enough to eat or having access to clean water.

The final characteristic making climate change such a thorny problem is that the pollutants causing it are tied directly to crucial aspects of people’s lives, including transportation, home electricity, and heating and air conditioning. Moreover, alternatives still tend to be more costly.

Some past environmental problems offered far easier solutions. The pollution that caused the hole in the ozone layer, for example — chlorofluorocarbons — were also a global pollutant and were tied to widely used products such as refrigeration, air conditioning and hairspray. But there were cheap, readily available alternatives. That’s not the case with the petroleum products we use to power our cars and the natural gas and coal still widely used to generate electricity. Yes, alternatives are being developed, but they are often more costly and haven’t been widely adopted worldwide.

If an evil genius had set out to design the perfect environmental crisis, one that would slowly destroy the earth through humans’ own actions and would be difficult to fight, those five factors would have made climate change a brilliant choice. But we didn’t need an evil genius. We stumbled into it on our own.

1241,"Climate change has caused considerable damage to the planet in the past, likely triggering a mass extinction some 359 million years ago. A study published in Science Advances has found the extinction event unfolded between the Devonian and Carboniferous periods and may have been facilitated by global warming . The study's authors believe the findings could have dire consequences for the current state of the climate.

According to John Marshall, lead author and Professor of Earth Science at the University of Southampton, the event wiped out dominant species of vertebrate life in the seas as well as the first four-legged tetrapods - fish whose fins evolved into primitive legs.

In an article for The Conversation, Professor Marshall wrote: ""The discovery of this potential new extinction mechanism indicates that a warming climate, such as we have now, has the potential to erode the ozone layer to let in damaging ultra-violet radiation.

""This has consequences for all life on Earth, both on the land and in shallow waters.""

1030,"A few weeks ago the world received the United Nations’ Emissions Gap Report 2019, which again laid out in jarring detail how much humans have heated up the atmosphere through carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. Not only is the science incontrovertible, but the impacts already are playing out before our eyes, and it’s probably too late, given the fast-rising temperature and political realities, to fully corral the problem. But it’s also inarguable that the world must act anyway — quickly — if it is to avert climate change’s most damaging effects, and that we desperately need innovative, persuasive and courageous political leaders to show the way.

Yet over the past year, and in the face of these ever more dire reports and warnings about the crisis that confronts us, President Trump has blithely continued to push policies and regulatory rollbacks that will increase carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. Another study released in November warned that despite the overwhelming evidence that the world needs to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, humankind will in 10 years be producing twice as much coal, oil and natural gas as it can safely consume and still limit the most severe impacts from human-caused global warming. That is disastrously wrong-headed. Governments around the world should be pursuing policies that will significantly reduce production and consumption while investing to support faster innovations in creating, distributing and storing renewable energy. Instead, Trump’s policies are designed to further increase U.S. production of oil and natural gas as part of his effort to make the U.S. the dominant producer of energy in the world.

So what did the Trump administration do this year to exacerbate the situation? It eased restrictions on the drilling of oil and gas wells in some sensitive habitats and drastically expanded the amount of federal lands available for leases by the oil, gas and coal industries (as well as mineral mining, which creates a different set of problems by exposing sensitive land to degradation). As part of that expansion, it shrank the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah and issued an executive order opening nearly all federal waters to offshore drilling (which the administration put on hold after legal setbacks). Trump loosened regulations limiting methane emissions at drilling sites. And after a Republican-led Congress in 2017 lifted the 35-year-old ban on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the administration moved this year to fast-track leases even as legal challenges work their way through the courts.

The Trump administration also this year finalized its rollback of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, which would have further restricted greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants, and replaced it instead with the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, a dubiously named policy that would do the opposite of what it seems to promise. The new rule not only contributes to global warming but seeks to shore up a domestic coal industry already dying because of market forces. (Other forms of energy production are cheaper.) The administration also reversed the Obama administration’s rejection of permits for the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline that will increase the flow of tar sands oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries.

Of course, those policies are what the nation should expect from a president who is skeptical, to say the least, that human activity is driving climate change. It’s true that just about any Republican administration would have sought to reduce regulations, but Trump’s full-on attack on the science of climate change and his abject support for fossil fuel industries stand out. (In fact, even some major oil companies recognize the global implications of burning their products.) Trump is the only national leader to renege on commitments made in the 2015 Paris agreement to cap the rise in global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Although our government played a vital role in reaching the Paris agreement, we will be the only nation in the world not in it.

By any objective assessment, his policies are pushing the nation — and by extension the world — into an environmental future of excessive heat, extended droughts, more frequent and stronger storms, rising seas and regional migrations of species — including humans, adding fuel for conflicts over natural resources.

If Trump thinks the Paris agreement posed an “unfair economic burden” on the U.S., as the administration described it, he ought to contemplate the costs of dealing with a warmer and more unstable climate. Americans — and the world — are going to pay one way or another for our generations of emitting greenhouse gases, whether Trump believes it or not.",mainstream
1259,"Bayer-Monsanto’s secret weapon: Ex-Green lobbyist to tell the world its cancer-linked weedkiller will save the climate

As Bayer sinks further into a morass of lawsuits centered on its deadly Roundup herbicide, the company is getting a much-needed makeover from a Green Party apostate determined to position it as the antidote to climate change.

The beleaguered corporation, plagued with lawsuits from cancer-stricken customers ever since it acquired Monsanto last year, hired former German Green Party MP Matthias Berninger as senior vice president for public and government affairs in January. The erstwhile environmentalist has wasted no time in his effort to save Bayer by positioning it as the answer to our climate change prayers. Pivoting the discussion away from Roundup’s potentially deadly effects on humans, Berninger has been making the media rounds to promote the herbicide’s environmental benefits.

What environmental benefits, you say?

“The data prove” that glyphosate – the chief chemical in Roundup – is good for the climate, Berninger (Pictured right) told German outlet Handelsblatt last week, explaining that while “the production of glyphosate is quite CO2-intensive,” its “use saves three times more CO2” compared to farming land with a tractor and plow, a process which he explains would spew out CO2 through its internal combustion engine and release the gas from the soil. In fact, Berninger really has it in for plows.

“It would be an illusion to believe that American or Brazilian agriculture would return to plowing,” he said, setting up and knocking down his rhetorical straw-man with ruthless efficiency. Nor would organic farming sustain a meat-hungry world – to hear him tell it, humanity must either dramatically expand farmland at the expense of biodiversity, or put its faith in crop science, a.k.a. Bayer.

Farmers stricken with cancer after prolonged RoundUp use might view the matter differently. While fewer living humans does mean a smaller carbon footprint for the species, and fewer living farmers in particular means less emissions produced by farming, it would take a real sociopath to stretch the idea of a “benefit” to include less market competition for farmers whose neighbors have died of Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma. But whether this is what Berninger has in mind when he describes glyphosate’s nebulous “benefits” to farmers and the planet is unclear – despite repeatedly referencing scientific evidence for glyphosate’s virtues, the former politician has remained mum on specifics of how the chemical benefits the environment, merely insisting in various ways that “independent regulatory authorities” have rated glyphosate “safe around the world for more than 40 years.”

Which independent authorities? Monsanto has been caught ghostwriting “independent” reviews touting the safety of its products in the past. The World Health Organization declared glyphosate was “probably carcinogenic” in 2015, while the state of California declared the chemical “known to cause cancer” in 2017. And the US Environmental Protection Agency, which recently reaffirmed “glyphosate is not a carcinogen” despite court verdicts piling up to the contrary, has long been accused of being “in bed with” Monsanto – even (especially) by scientists previously employed by the agency, who claim it bent the rules to greenlight the popular herbicide. Regulators haven’t weighed in on whether glyphosate is toxic to plants because that’s the whole purpose of an herbicide – indeed, Monsanto has made billions selling genetically-engineered “Roundup-ready” seeds so that farmers can grow crops that won’t die when they’re sprayed with the weedkiller. It would take serious logical gymnastics on Berninger’s part to paint this absence of regulatory condemnation as a seal of approval.

But the ex-Green wants the world to know that Bayer is more than just glyphosate. Touting the company’s “unique potential to help achieve the UN sustainability goals,” Berninger hinted that “by promoting the comprehensive digitalization of agriculture,” the company could eventually move toward the use of fewer “crop protection products.” But not too few, he stressed – “we also hope that politicians are open to the approval of the next generation of crop protection products that are effective in even smaller quantities.”

“We don’t have to apologize for making money,” Berninger – once the youngest member of the Bundestag – told Germany’s Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger earlier this month, insisting Bayer could expiate past environmental sins through achieving “sustainability goals.” The company’s presentation of those goals on its website is enormously vague, promising that environmental sustainability is a priority (its CEO will take on the additional title of Chief Sustainability Officer in January!) and pledging that Bayer will eventually achieve 100 percent carbon neutrality. The corporation has also pledged to provide 100 million “smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries” with “holistic solutions” to “grow crops more sustainably” and increase both yields and incomes.

That last bit sounds quite noble, but one must ask: where do the (carbon-neutral) agrochemicals fit in with sustainable or holistic farming methods? Smallholder farmers from India, where Monsanto has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of suicides triggered by debts incurred by the high price of the company’s seeds and pesticides, to Brazil, where the company double-dips by collecting royalties from the sale of crops grown with its heavily-regulated seeds, are trying hard to move away from Monsanto products. Bayer might think its assistance will “help more people thrive within planetary boundaries,” but even its PR people know the Monsanto name is as toxic as its products – “partnerships with public, private and local organizations are key to address smallholder farmers’ needs holistically,” it admits.

Under Berninger’s direction, Bayer joined an alliance of over 200 companies called the Brazilian Coalition for Climate, Forest and Agriculture, wrapping itself in concern for the Amazon rainforest (perhaps as a distraction from the murmurs of discontent among Brazilian farmers, who lost out last month on a $2 billion payout after a court reversed a ruling to favor Monsanto). This heterogeneous group has appealed to the Brazilian government to seize control of the destruction of the Amazon, claiming some 90 percent of the logging is illegal – though their goal is less to end the devastation than to put Brasilia in charge. Indeed, Bayer isn’t remotely interested in ending the clear-cutting of rainforest land to make way for the soybean cultivation that fuels the world’s skyrocketing meat consumption. According to Berninger, Bayer’s role will instead involve driving “innovation” in “sustainable intensification” – i.e. growing more soybeans per hectare on ex-rainforest land, presumably with the help of glyphosate, in the hope that less land is ultimately needed.

Rainforests aren’t the only thing Bayer has pledged to rescue in its own special way. After getting caught secretly financing two German studies on glyphosate in October, the company flipped the script and announced it had begun campaigning for transparency in lobbying. Berninger has since called for a lobby transparency law “such as those that exist in the US” – the country where lobbying is so disastrously unregulated a novice congresswoman exposing the industry’s lawlessness can go viral – repeatedly – and where a long-running joke calls for politicians to wear the logos of their biggest sponsors on their clothing in the manner of race-car drivers.

Tasked with the seemingly-impossible task of greenwashing a company widely considered one of the most evil on the planet, Berninger is nevertheless rising to the occasion, framing Bayer as a defender of the rainforest and a standard-bearer of modern farming practices. But it’s anyone’s guess whether the corporation currently being sued by farmers from Canada to Australia will be able to pass itself off as their savior, especially with entire countries – Austria recently became the first in the EU – kicking its star glyphosate weedkiller to the curb. And even if Berninger is able to summon enough climatebabble to convince the relevant authorities that Roundup is a noble soldier in the fight against global warming, Monsanto has enough skeletons in its closet to keep even the slickest PR man running in circles until the glaciers melt.

993,"FRIDAY, Dec. 20, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Rising obesity rates worldwide may be contributing to the climate crisis, researchers report.

""Our analysis suggests that, in addition to beneficial effects on morbidity, mortality and health care costs, managing obesity can favorably affect the environment as well,"" said study corresponding author Faidon Magkos, from the department of nutrition, exercise and sports at the University of Copenhagen, in Denmark.

Like other oxygen-dependent creatures, humans emit carbon dioxide that's produced by metabolic processes necessary to live, the scientists explained.

The amount of carbon dioxide -- a greenhouse gas -- produced by a species is determined by its average metabolic rate, average body size and the total number of individuals of the species.

Obese people produce more carbon dioxide than those of normal weight, the researchers said.

Also, obese people consume greater quantities of food and beverages that need to be produced and transported to them, and transportation of obese people requires more consumption of fossil fuels. This means higher carbon dioxide emissions related to food production and transportation for obese people, the study authors explained.

The researchers estimated that obesity contributes to an extra 700 megatons of carbon dioxide emissions per year worldwide, or about 1.6% of all human-caused emissions.

Overall, being obese is associated with about 20% more greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) than being a normal weight, according to the study published online Dec. 20 in the journal Obesity.

""This has important implications for all those involved in the management of obesity,"" Magkos added in a journal news release.

The researchers stressed that these findings should not lead to more stigmatization for obese people, who already face negative attitudes and discrimination.

Ted Kyle is founder of ConscienHealth, an organization that works to find sound approaches to health and obesity. ""This study makes it clear that we pay a steep price for making it difficult to access care for obesity. Not only does obesity affect the health of the individuals who have it, untreated obesity might also contribute to environmental issues,"" said Kyle.",mainstream

940,"Is anthropogenic global warming occurring? Perhaps, says the author, although an examination of the evidence suggests that it will not be catastrophic and reality tells us that, despite significant expenditure on mitigating climate change, we had better learn to adapt to it.

This volume is a comprehensive examination of why this is the case, enabling readers to understand the complexity associated with climate change policy and the science behind it. For example, the author describes the criticism and defense of the widely known “hockey stick” temperature graph derived from combining instrumental data and proxy temperature indications using tree ring, ice core and other paleoclimatic data.

Readers will also learn that global warming cannot easily be avoided by reducing CO and other greenhouse gas emissions in rich countries. Not only is emissions reduction extremely difficult in rich countries, but demands such as the UN mandate to improve the lives of the poorest global citizens cannot be satisfied without significantly increasing global energy use, and CO emissions. Therefore, the author asserts that climate engineering and adaptation are preferable to mitigation, particularly since the science is less than adequate for making firm statements about the Earth’s future climate.

1091,"On a warm August evening, Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting women the right to vote. It was the culmination of a 144-year odyssey from the Declaration of Independence and clarified once and for all, the meaning of “all men are created equal.” As was the case throughout this journey, the final vote did not come easy.

It all came down to one man, 24-year-old state legislator Harry Burn. On the morning of August 18, 1920, Mr. Burn, who had been against ratification, received a letter from his mother which stated, “Dear son… Vote for suffrage and don’t keep them in doubt… Don’t forget to be a good boy…”

As the roll call neared his name, he clutched the letter from his mother in his hand.

“Mr. Burns…” the assembly clerk called his name.

And then, it was done. The painful struggle was over. American women had the right to vote and with it, full citizenship. The arduous work of thousands of women—and men—had finally been rewarded. However, to truly appreciate this achievement, one has to understand how far American attitudes towards women had evolved from the previous century.

By the early 19th century, American society had fully embraced the “Cult of True Womanhood,” an ideology that claimed women were best suited in the home, serving as the family’s moral guide. This protected-class status was intended to shield women from being sullied by the nefarious influences of work, politics and making war. In reality, the custom paved the way for laws banning women from attending colleges, entering professional work, voting, serving on juries and testifying in court. Many states outlawed women from owning property or entering into contracts. From an early age, women were placed on the path of marriage and motherhood. For single women, options were limited to teaching or nursing, with the social label of being an “old maid.”

However, during this time the United States was also going through a tremendous transformation. Industry was surpassing agriculture in productivity and profitability. Slavery’s days were numbered, though its demise would only happen through civil war. Religious enlightenment was engaging Americans to think of themselves as a chosen people with a mission to improve society. The political climate was ripe and in need of women’s moral guidance. At the top of the list was the abolition of slavery. Two sisters from a South Carolina plantation, Angelina and Sara Grimke, wrote and spoke fervently to end slavery. The subsequent disapproval by some clergymen of their activities led them to expand their efforts towards women’s rights.

Fueled by the writings of 18th-century women’s rights activist Mary Wollstonecraft, whose book A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, many women began to push for greater rights. The seminal moment for Elizabeth Cady Stanton came while attending the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London when she, and the other women attending, were banned from participating in the proceedings.

When Stanton returned to her hometown of Seneca Falls, New York, she and her friend Lucretia Mott organized the first women’s right convention, held on July 19-20, 1848. There she introduced a “Declaration of Rights and Sentiments” modeled after the Declaration of Independence. As she stood before the delegation, she nervously read from the document,

“We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”

The convention delegates nodded approvingly, hearing the familiar words spoken. Emboldened, Stanton introduced several resolutions, the last advocating a woman’s right to vote. Many delegates, both men and women, were appalled at the audacity. Some doubted whether women were qualified to vote, while others felt that such a right was unnecessary as most women would likely vote with their husbands. After a stirring speech by African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass, the resolution passed. The partnership between abolition and suffrage had been solidified and, it seemed, the two movements would achieve their respective goals together.

The NWSA was formed to support the 15th amendment

The next pivotal battle for women’s equality took place in 1868 during Congressional debates on the 15th Amendment, guaranteeing the right to vote. Women had worked hard over the past 20 years for black freedom and enfranchisement and expected they would be included in this goal. While many abolitionists were initially supportive of suffrage for both African Americans and women, leaders felt that it was now “the Negro’s hour” and to ask for more would jeopardize the cause. In an unexpected turnaround, Frederick Douglass made an impassioned plea at the American Equal Rights Association convention to let the black man go first, turning the effort away from enfranchising women.

Stanton and Susan B. Anthony saw this as a betrayal and campaigned against any amendment that denied women the right to vote. This caused a breach in the women’s movement and led to Stanton and Anthony forming the National Women’s Suffrage Association (NWSA), while Lucy Stone, her husband Henry Blackwell, and Julia Ward Howe founded the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which supported the 15th Amendment.

Many African American women also pushed for women’s rights, beginning with Sojourner Truth, who in 1851 made her impassioned “Ain’t I a Woman” speech. Other African American women, such as Mary Anne Shadd Cary and Charlotte Forten Grimke (the niece of two abolitionists/suffragists Margaretta and Harriet Forten) participated in suffrage organizations. Unfortunately, as was the case in society, oftentimes African American women weren’t always welcomed by white suffragists and had to participate in separate organizations. In 1896, many black women’s clubs affiliated to form the National Association of Colored Women with Mary Church Terrell as president.

Through the second half of the 19th century, the suffrage movement remained divided. In the 1870s, some women used the language of the 14th Amendment to try to vote. In 1872, Susan B. Anthony was arrested when she illegally voted in a presidential election. She was fined $100, which she never paid, and moved on. This tactic of invoking the 14th Amendment to enfranchise women was permanently squashed when the Supreme Court ruled in Minor v. Happersett (1875) that the 14th Amendment did not grant women the right to vote.

In 1874, Francis Willard founded the Women’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) which soon became the largest and most powerful women’s movement in the country. Its hundreds of thousands of members helped support the suffrage movement, but linking suffrage to prohibition was strongly opposed by many who were not against alcohol and weakening the effort.

By the 1890s, the acrimony between the two women’s suffrage associations had subsided and they merged into the National American Suffrage Association (NAWSA). With the passing of Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1902 and Susan B. Anthony in 1906, a new generation of leaders assumed control of the women’s movement. NAWSA president Carrie Chapman Catt pursued a state-by-state strategy to win the vote for women, which by 1896, proved successful in four states—Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, and Colorado. Still, the goal of national suffrage was a long way off. However, Catt left the organization tired of the internal squabbling.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Progressive movement emerged to address issues associated with industrialization, immigration and urbanization. Many in the labor movement saw women as allies and potential voters for their cause. In 1906, Harriot Stanton Blatch, Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s daughter, founded the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women to organize working-class suffragists. In 1910, they conducted the first large-scale suffrage march in the United States. In addition, black women founded clubs that worked exclusively for woman’s suffrage, such as the Alpha Suffrage Club of Chicago, founded by Ida B. Wells in 1913.

In 1915, Carrie Chapman Catt returned as president of NAWSA and turned the organization into an effective political machine, recruiting key supporters, raising money, and conducting public demonstrations with participants wearing white uniforms designed to draw crowds and newspaper reporters. Catt set up a Washington office to exert pressure on members of Congress and convince the Democratic and Republican parties to support women’s suffrage. In addition, she developed a close relationship with President Woodrow Wilson to gain his support.

In 1919, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate finally voted to approve the 19th Amendment. The bill went on to the states, seeking the approval of three-quarters of state legislatures. It finally happened a year later on that hot August night in Tennessee, when young Hank Burn followed the advice of his mother and cast his vote for women’s suffrage.

However, the battle for women’s equality didn’t end there. Within a decade, state laws disenfranchised most African American women — and men — under the custom of Jim Crow. It would take another movement in the 1960s before all blacks in the South would be enfranchised. The struggle for gender equality continues today for equal pay and opportunity and equal justice in cases of rape and assault.",mainstream
1146,"As our nation responds to the economic devastation of the , a well-designed climate policy can strengthen America’s recovery and improve its strategic position in the world. Our bipartisan carbon-dividend solution – backed by a broad coalition of supporters – is ideally suited for this moment.

It will be tough enough to reverse today’s economic crisis and alleviate the misery many Americans are experiencing without adding expensive or ill-conceived climate policies. An effective policy must enhance – not hamper – a domestic economy currently being savaged by the pandemic. It should also promote the competitiveness of American firms, compel China and India to do their fair share, and position the United States to win the clean energy race.

Our solution to this critical challenge is a revenue-neutral national carbon fee that cuts U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in half by 2035 and returns all the revenues raised directly to all Americans.

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP LABELS TRUMP AS ‘DIRTIEST OF ALL TIME

Long preferred by economists and business leaders, a well-designed and gradually rising carbon fee is the most cost-effective climate solution. But rather than allow Congress to spend revenues from such a fee on projects that it chooses, the money would be returned to American families in the form of a quarterly dividend. A carbon fee that neither grows the government nor drains the economy is not a tax in the truest form.

Our carbon dividend proposal would benefit those most devastated by the growing economic recession. To cushion the initial economic blow of the pandemic, Republicans and Democrats quickly agreed to send direct cash payments to low- and middle-income families. But such payments can be financed by debt for only so long.

Our plan would keep direct payments to all American families flowing for the long term, and in a manner that is fully funded. Most families, and especially the most vulnerable, would benefit financially under this climate solution.

To further stimulate the economy, our plan calls for lessening the current regulatory regime that will stunt the ability of American industry to respond to the current crisis. An escalating carbon fee that reduces emissions at the required scale and speed enables us to safely and responsibly replace regulations that would no longer be necessary.

Such a COVID-era climate policy will thus provide the predictability companies need to make the kind of long-term investments that will be a critical aspect of an economic rebound.

Unshackled by these regulations, American ingenuity will return our country to its prior position as the world’s leading energy innovator. The United States now ranks a distant fourth behind China, Germany and Japan in the production, export and installation of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries.

Just as dominance in the information technology revolution underpinned America’s economic dynamism and job growth over the past two decades, dominating the clean tech revolution will be similarly consequential in the future. Falling behind in the clean energy race imperils not only our economic strength but also our broader national interest.

No less important, our climate policy promotes the competitiveness of U.S. firms and the re-shoring of manufacturing jobs. Although American industries produce less carbon per unit than many of their competitors in other countries, current U.S. policy fails to leverage this advantage.

Effectively, we subsidize less carbon-efficient manufacturing in China and elsewhere, and invite “carbon dumping” by nations with more lax environmental standards. In a world of lower oil prices, reversing this situation will become even more important in protecting and enhancing the competitiveness of our companies.

The best way to level the playing field and monetize America’s carbon advantage is to impose carbon tariffs on imports from countries without a similar climate program, all as part of a comprehensive U.S. climate strategy. Such a policy could help the United States reclaim its historic position at the head of the global table, thereby advancing our economic and geopolitical interests at the same time.

Convincing other leading emitters such as China and India to effectively reduce their carbon emissions is a difficult chore. The proposed tariffs, however, would compel China and India to either follow suit or face economic penalties.

629,"I’m boarding a train from London for a 16-hour rail journey to a city that is, to paraphrase Greta Thunberg, ‘listening to the scientists’. My Eurostar rolls out of St Pancras International on schedule at 06.40. Ahead lies a tight change in Brussels, a quick stop in Cologne and an overnight train ferry to Denmark, all covered by my Interrail Pass. I could’ve flown to Singapore in the time this journey will take me, but with Copenhagen on course to become the world’s first carbon-neutral city by 2025, travelling there by train seems appropriate.

The Danish capital first made a commitment to go carbon-neutral in 2010 — five years before the Paris Agreement, which saw global leaders agree to combat climate change and intensify efforts towards a sustainable, low-carbon future. Going carbon-neutral means the city will produce no more carbon emissions than it can offset elsewhere; essentially, there will be no net release of carbon dioxide. The move is significant as most scientists agree there’s a link between the rising CO2 levels and Earth’s rising temperatures.

What’s clear is that the travel industry generates a hefty carbon footprint, not least through aviation. A 2018 study published in Nature Climate Change found travel accounted for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions between 2009 and 2013, with the number of international travellers growing at a rate of 3-5% per year. I myself possess a Sasquatch-sized carbon footprint, but I mitigate it somewhat by sticking to public transport, avoiding the energy-intensive production associated with eating meat and offsetting my air travel carbon emissions.

Yet individual action feels like a drop in an overheating ocean, so it’s up to countries and cities to create a collective framework of sustainability and carbon-free options that help residents and travellers negate their carbon footprint. And Copenhagen is leading the way.

Half a decade on from the Paris Agreement, as countries and politicians across the globe renege on CO2-reduction targets — or, in President Trump’s case, withdraw from the agreement entirely — Copenhagen is making impressive strides towards carbon-neutrality. In 2017, it produced around 1.37 million tonnes of harmful climate gases, down 42% from 2005, explains Jørgen Abildgaard, the city’s executive climate program director. He’s confident the 2025 goal will be met.

“We’ve 20% to go to reach the target,” he says, adding that tackling private road emissions remains Copenhagen’s biggest challenge. “Many cities, like Washington, Amsterdam and Helsinki, are following our lead — even if their targets aren’t as ambitious. We can learn from others — even London,” he adds, perhaps generously. “We’re looking at your congestion charge to deter car journeys.”

Copenhagen’s own methods, however, are exemplary. Having pledged to cut down on the use of fossil fuels, the city increasingly generates renewable energy from offshore wind turbines and its largest power plant has replaced coal with wood pellets. Around 98% of the city is heated by waste heat from electricity production, 49% of all journeys are made by bike, and all diesel buses are being replaced by electric substitutes.

“But carbon-neutral isn’t just about environmental targets. It’s about creating healthier cities for people to live in,” explains Jørgen.

And so, with a little thought and planning, I’ve identified four key sectors in which to lessen the carbon impact of my journey: travel, activities, accommodation and food. Taking the train from London produces far less in the way of CO2 than flying. However, for travellers short on time, these emissions are straightforward enough to offset. Had I flown, the 0.2 tons of CO2 my journey would have produced could have been offset at sites like myclimate.org at a cost of just £5 — a donation that would then go on to fund carbon-ameliorating projects such as reforestation in Nicaragua.",mainstream

For example, the main driver of climate change, fossil fuel combustion, also contributes about 2/3 of human exposure to outdoor air pollution, which causes over 4 million deaths a year. Including indoor air pollution brings the total to over 7 million deaths worldwide every year – about 1 in every 8 deaths.

The overall cost to human wellbeing, and to economies, is enormous. Air pollution alone costs an estimated US$ 5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally each year. In the 15 countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, the health impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4% of their GDP. Public concern over the health impacts of air pollution is an increasing driver of social movements for action on climate change and overall environmental protection. Meeting the Paris goals would result in health gains which are twice as large as the costs of the mitigation measures from improved air quality alone.

The health gains of climate action go well beyond air quality. They range from more sustainable diets and food systems addressing the rising burden of disease associated with overweight and obesity, to urban transport systems that facilitate walking and cycling, and bringing health gains from increased physical activity.

Weighing in both the impacts of health-damaging business-as-usual policies and the massive health co-benefits of ambitious climate policy, drives climate policies that are more ambitious and health-promoting.

The Global Conference on Health & Climate Change will bring together a range of key actors in public health and climate change policy in order to incorporate public health and climate justice considerations in the UN climate negotiations. It will highlight the initiatives, policies and cross-sectoral collaborations that are driving ambitious and healthy Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement in the lead-up to COP26.

The conference will be organized by the World Health Organization - convening its 4th Global Conference on Health and Climate - and by the Global Climate and Health Alliance - convening its 8th Global Climate and Health Summit - in close collaboration with the Glasgow Caledonian University and its Centre for Climate Justice, the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change and other partners.

The overarching theme of the Conference will be Healthy and Ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, and will include sessions on the health co-benefits of a broad range of climate policies, including clean energy policies; air quality measures; subsidy reform; smart agriculture and sustainable food systems; educational and civil society involvement; nature-based solutions and others.

A series of WHO-led initiatives, case-studies and workshops throughout 2020 will feed into the outcomes of the global health & climate conference and the COP26 UN climate conference.

1266,"Over the past few weeks Clover Hogan has found herself crying during the day and waking up at night gripped by panic. The 20-year-old, who now lives in London, grew up in Queensland, Australia, cheekbyjowl with the country’s wildlife, fishing frogs out of the toilet and dodging snakes hanging from the ceiling.

The bushfires ravaging her homeland over the past few weeks have taken their toll. “I’ve found myself bursting into tears … just seeing the absolutely harrowing images of what’s happening in Australia – it is overwhelming and terrifying.”

Hogan said her lowest point came when she heard about the death of half a billion animals incinerated as the fires swept through the bush. “That was the moment where I felt my heart cleave into two pieces. I felt absolutely distraught.”

The physical impact of the climate crisis is impossible to ignore, but experts are becoming increasingly concerned about another, less obvious consequence of the escalating emergency – the strain it is putting on people’s mental wellbeing, especially the young.

Psychologists warn that the impact can be debilitating for the growing number of people overwhelmed by the scientific reality of ecological breakdown and for those who have lived through traumatic climate events, often on the climate frontline in the global south..

Until two years ago Dr Patrick Kennedy-Williams, a clinical psychologist from Oxford, had spent his career treating common mental health difficulties including anxiety, depression and trauma. Then something new started to happen. Climate scientists and researchers working in Oxford began to approach him asking for help.

“These were people who were essentially facing a barrage of negative information and downward trends in their work … and the more they engaged with the issue, the more they realised what needed to be done – and the more they felt that was bigger than their capacity to enact meaningful change,” he said. “The consequences of this can be pretty dire – anxiety, burnout and a sort of professional paralysis.”

Kennedy-Williams began to research the topic and realised it was not just scientists and researchers who were suffering. “There is a huge need among parents, for instance, who are asking for support on how to talk to their kids about this.”

When Kennedy-Williams began focusing on young people he assumed most would be older teenagers or at least have started secondary school. But he soon discovered worrying levels of environment-related stress and anxiety in much younger children.

“What I was most surprised by is how young the awareness and anxiety starts. My own daughter was just six when she came to me and said: ‘Daddy, are we winning the war against climate change?’ and I was just flummoxed by that question in the moment. It really showed me the importance as a parent of being prepared for the conversation, so we can respond in a helpful way.”

He says there is no way to completely shield young people from the reality of the climate crisis, and argues that would be counterproductive even if it were possible. Rather, parents should talk to their children about their concerns and help them feel empowered to take action – however small – that can make a difference.

A key moment for Kennedy-Williams came with the realisation that tackling “climate anxiety” and tackling the climate crisis were intrinsically linked.

“The positive thing from our perspective as psychologists is that we soon realised the cure to climate anxiety is the same as the cure for climate change – action. It is about getting out and doing something that helps.

“Record and celebrate the changes you make. Nobody is too small. Make connections with other people and at the same time realise that you are not going to cure this problem on your own. This isn’t all on you and it’s not sustainable to be working on solving climate change 24/7.”

This certainly resonates with Hogan, who has set up Force of Nature, an initiative aimed at helping young people realise their potential to create change.

Hogan’s group aims to target people aged 11-24 with a crash course in the climate crisis that helps them navigate their anxiety and realise their potential to get involved, take action and make a stand.

“This is only the beginning,” said Hogan. “We’re going to see massive, massive widespread climate crisis in every country around the world, so it’s about developing the emotional resilience to carry on, but in a way that ignites really dramatic individual initiative.”

Beyond climate anxiety – the fear that the current system is pushing the Earth beyond its ecological limits – experts are also warning of a sharp rise in trauma caused by the experience of climate-related disasters.

In the global south, increasingly intense storms, wildfires, droughts and heatwaves have left their mark not just physically but also on the mental wellbeing of millions of people.

For Elizabeth Wathuti, a climate activist from Kenya, her experience of climate anxiety is not so much about the future but what is happening now. “People in African countries experience eco-anxiety differently because climate change for us is about the impacts that we are already experiencing now and the possibilities of the situation getting worse,” she said.

She works with young people through the Green Generation Initiative she founded and sees the effects of eco-anxiety first-hand. A common worry she hears among students is: “We won’t die of old age, we’ll die from climate change.”

Extreme climate events can create poverty, which exacerbates mental health problems, and Wathuti says she has seen stress, depression and alcohol and drug abuse as some of the side-effects of climate anxiety and trauma in her country.

Even in the UK, a recent study by the Environment Agency found that people who experience extreme weather such as storms or flooding are 50% more likely to suffer from mental health problems, including stress and depression, for years afterwards.

More than 1,000 clinical psychologists have signed an open letter highlighting the impact of the crisis on people’s wellbeing and predicting “acute trauma on a global scale in response to extreme weather events, forced migration and conflict”.

Kaaren Knight, a clinical psychologist who coordinated the letter, said: “The physical impacts related to extreme weather, food shortages and conflict are intertwined with the additional burden of mental health impacts and it is these psychologists are particularly concerned about.”

She added that fear and trauma “significantly reduced psychological wellbeing”, particularly in children. “This is of huge concern to us and needs to be part of the conversation when we talk about climate breakdown.”

One of the high-profile signatories of the letter, Prof Mike Wang, the chair of the Association of Clinical Psychologists UK, said: “Inaction and complacency are the privileges of yesterday … Psychologists are ready and willing to help countries protect the health and wellbeing of their citizens given the inevitable social and psychological consequences of climate change.”

This rallying of the psychological profession around the climate crisis has led to experts around the world forming groups to research and treat the growing number of people caught up in the unfolding crisis, attempting to help them move from fear and paralysis towards action.

But even for those who are following this advice, the scale of the emergency is taking its toll. Kennedy Williams – who has set up his own group, Climate Psychologists, specialising in climate anxiety – said he and his colleagues were not immune from the psychological impacts of the crisis.

“This is such a universal thing that [we] have all been through our own set of climate-related grief and despair, and we talk about riding the wave between hope and despair … it is absolutely as real for us as it is for anyone else.”

Remember that you do not need to be a climate expert It’s OK to explore learning together. If your child asks a question you can’t answer immediately, respond by saying: “What a great question. Let me look into that so I can answer it properly.”

Try to validate, rather than minimise, children’s emotions If children express anxiety, it’s much better to say: “It’s OK to feel worried. Here is what we can do about it,” than to say: “Don’t worry. It’s all fine.” But always try to support this emotion with suggestions for positive action.

Negative information hits harder Bad or threatening facts tend to resonate more strongly – and therefore stick in the mind. So try to balance one piece of negative news with three pieces of positive news. Have some examples of good climate-related news ready – for example, successful conservation projects.

For younger children, keep it local and tangible Suggest litter picks and school events. For teenagers, encourage them to stay connected at a wider level – help them write to their MP, take part in protests and join local communities and campaigns.

1160,"This project is designed to evaluate Colorado weatherization programs used to adapt homes in low-income communities to a changing climate against empirical evidence of respiratory health effects and measurements of indoor air quality (IAQ) and ventilation rates. Our hypotheses are that (1) the weatherization of homes tightens the building shell and reduces ventilation rates, which will be associated with adverse respiratory health effects; and (2) during large wildfires, which are increasing in number and magnitude due to climate change, the particulate levels in homes that are weatherized by tightening the building shell will be lower compared to non-weatherized homes.

To test our hypotheses, we will partner with the Colorado Energy Office (CEO) weatherization program agencies for low-income residents to recruit at least 250 homes over 1.5 years. In 125 single-family homes that have had weatherization improvements and 125 single-family homes that have not been weatherized we will assess, through a combination of questionnaires, lung function testing, household walkthrough, and blower door testing the home characteristics and respiratory health of the residents. Lung function will be documented with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) measurements. Weatherized and non-weatherized homes will be selected in neighborhood pairs and non-weatherized homes will be screened using the income-eligibility requirements of the weatherization programs. On a subset of 30 homes (15 weatherized, and 15 not weatherized), we will continue assessment during prolonged wildfires to explore impacts on IAQ. In the subset of homes, we will measure temperature, relative humidity, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, and particulate matter both indoors and outdoors of the homes during and after wildfires. Home ventilation rates will be estimated using a model linking weather data and leakage area.

603,"Climate science is the study of regional and global climate as a system. While meteorologists try to predict forthcoming local weather using detailed analysis of recent patterns, climate scientists aim to understand, and replicate through modelling, how the climate system works as a whole.

Climate scientists use a vast array of monitoring data to create detailed supercomputer models that reproduce the interacting mechanisms of the climate system in ever-increasing detail. As we learn more, the modelling becomes ever more complex and the output more accurate. We can look far into the future or focus on local effects, and experiment with the many different variables that influence climate.

We want to understand how our climate is changing, how variations in the contributing systems affect each other and the likely impact of these changes on ecosystems and human life - on a global, regional and local scale.

Among other things, our climate models are predicting how increasing carbon dioxide (CO ) levels will affect global temperatures and what reduction in carbon dioxide CO levels is necessary to keep global warming in check.

Our climate scientists have been working with the UK government and other research agencies on a programme called The AVOID2 programme on avoiding 'dangerous' climate change, which explores the potential long-term effects of 'dangerous' climate change. We define 'dangerous' climate change effects as those that are irreversible, spiraling (self-reinforcing), very large or very rapid, and with a serious impact on natural and human systems.

If global emissions continue unabated at their current rate, the planet's surface temperature is projected to reach 4 °C above pre-industrial levels by the close of the current century. That is the 'business as usual' pathway, and leads to dangerous climate change on a number of fronts. The AVOID programme examined emissions pathways that would limit warming, the mitigation measures that would make it possible and the impacts of climate change that could be avoided.

The ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. Stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at sufficiently low levels will limit global temperatures rise to under 2 °C until at least 2500.

Dangerous changes to the climate system
• Melting sea ice: although sea ice melting may be reversible, the damage it causes won't be.
• Sea level rise: any rise will cause severe and irreversible harm to coastal habitats.
• North Atlantic drift shutdown: severe warming could shut down the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which warms the British Isles and north-west Europe, leading to a temperature drop.
• Tropical forest fires: drier tropical forests may escalate the loss of CO -absorbing biomass.
• Emissions from wetlands, permafrost and oceans: increased temperatures will release more organic greenhouse gases, potentially in a vicious circle.
• Extreme temperatures: heatwave summers could become very common.
• Coasts: the cost of sea level rises could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars each year.
• Ecosystems and biodiversity: tropical ecosystems have joined polar, mountain, coral and Mediterranean on the list of the most vulnerable habitats, which will be severely damaged by 2-3 °C warming.
• Fresh water: big changes in rainfall patterns will severely reduce runoff in some areas and increase it in others, leading to raised flood risk. The proportion of land in extreme drought could rise from 1% to almost a third by the end of the century.
• Agriculture and food security: crop yields are expected to decline with climate change.
• Human health: with 2 °C of global warming, cold-related deaths would decline but heat-related deaths would increase. Studies suggest cases of malaria, too, would increase.

Modelling results from the Met Office Hadley Centre performed for the Committee on Climate Change developed a feasible idealised emission scenarios leading to a 50% probability of limiting warming to 2 °C . This scenario requires a peak of emissions in 2016 or earlier, followed by a 4% rate of global emissions reduction.

Limiting the warming will require local, national and international co-operation, and a range of renewable fuels and carbon capture technologies to be fully developed, assessed and implemented.

Emissions reduction, or mitigation, will be costly. However, the cost of damage to human and natural systems if global warming is not kept below 2 °C is many times greater.",mainstream

855,"Fox News now demanding the criminalization and ARREST of “anti-vaxxers” … we warned you this was coming

A quick reminder to our many faithful readers: Don’t believe everything you hear over at Fox News, despite the network’s seeming support for conservative, a.k.a. liberty-centric, ideals – because things are not always as they seem.

Just a few days ago, Fox News Medical Correspondent, Dr. Marc Siegel, declared war on health freedom by stating that he believes doctors who issue vaccine exemptions should be prosecuted.

Responding to the recent measles “outbreak” in Washington State, Dr. Siegel went on a tirade against parents who choose not to vaccinate their children with the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella, expressing anger over the fact that some Americans are exercising their freedom not to vaccinate.

“This is a disgrace,” Dr. Siegel shouted during the segment. “And I am hoping that the doctors that are responsible for this get prosecuted.”

When asked to explain what he believes is the problem, Dr. Siegel went on to state that “there are a few doctors in California that are not even pediatricians, (who) are writing exemption letters for a ton of kids in certain schools.”

“Some schools have up to 20 percent of their kids don’t have the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine because they got a crazy exemption letter that’s fraudulent,” Dr. Siegel added, barely taking a breath amid his rant.

Big Pharma is the biggest advertiser at Fox News

Anyone who watches Fox News and pays close attention to what’s being advertised during every commercial break has likely noticed that the network pushes pharmaceutical drug after pharmaceutical drug after pharmaceutical drug – so much drug advertising, in fact, that Fox News might as well be renamed Big Pharma News.

100% organic essential oil sets now available for your home and personal care, including Rosemary, Oregano, Eucalyptus, Tea Tree, Clary Sage and more, all 100% organic and laboratory tested for safety. A multitude of uses, from stress reduction to topical first aid. See the complete listing here, and help support this news site.

With this in mind, it’s not really all that surprising that Fox‘s top medical talking head is aggressively pro-vaccine, as drugs and vaccines appear to be what keeps Fox News financially afloat. It would also explain why Fox News remains aggressively anti-cannabis, as healing plants are a threat to Fox‘s Big Pharma advertisers.

ALL Americans have the right to refuse vaccines for ANY reason

Contrary to Dr. Siegel’s wild claims, vaccine exemptions are not “fraudulent,” and all doctors, pediatricians or otherwise, are free to write them for whomever they wish. Further, sovereign American citizens are free to refuse vaccines for any reason, and don’t technically or legally need a vaccine exemption at all – though the medical establishment is working overtime to squelch that truth, as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, warned about.

“A medical doctor can give you an exemption for whatever you want, but there’s not even a law there,” points out Alex Jones from Infowars.

Be sure to watch the full segment with Alex Jones about the MMR vaccine below:

“So [Dr. Siegel is] saying it’s a fraud, when he’s engaged in fraud. See, he’s saying these are ‘fraudulent letters’ – you don’t even need the letter for the exemption. They just trick you into that. You have a right – there’s no law that you have to take these vaccines.”

According to Dr. Siegel, however, it’s a “problem” that parents are “allowed” to refuse vaccines even with a signed medical exemption. In his view, the MMR vaccine, and presumably all vaccines, are simply awesome – which, in his mind, means that everybody should be forced by the government to get injected.

“It is one of the greatest inventions in the history of public health,” Dr. Siegel maintains about the MMR vaccine.

705,"""We are confronted with a global climate crisis and the point of no return is no longer over the horizon, it is in sight and hurtling towards us,"" said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the eve of the two-week COP25 global climate summit in Madrid.

""Our war against nature must stop, and we know that it is possible,"" he said Sunday. ""We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions.""

Across the globe, catastrophic weather patterns — from floods to fire to extreme droughts and heavy snowstorms — are wreaking havoc on both human and animal life. Scientists are warning that the world is running out of time to reverse the worst possible effects of man-made climate breakdown.

Guterres took member nations to task for not sticking to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which calls on a limit to fossil fuel use in an attempt to curb global temperatures increases.

'World's largest emitters are not pulling their weight'

""We also see clearly that the world's largest emitters are not pulling their weight,"" he said, ""and without them, our goal is unreachable.""

The world's largest carbon emitter is China and the second-largest, the United States.

At last year's UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, member states drew up a framework for monitoring emission reductions and made plans for further cuts in the future. However, there has still been no agreement on key elements like putting a price on CO2 emissions that could allow carbon taxes to be traded between countries.

On Friday, mass rallies were held around the world as people called on their governments to address climate change before it's too late.

The newly minted leadership of the European Commission, under former German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, has set lofty climate goals for itself under a policy initiative called the ""European Green Deal."" Among the goals set out by the campaign is the plan to make Europe the ""first carbon-neutral continent.""

As von der Leyen and her cabinet took office on Sunday, she hailed the COP25 summit as the perfect ""starting point"" for her climate policy plans.

""Europe is leading in this topic and we know that we have to be ambitious for our planet,'' von der Leyen told reporters.

On Thursday, European lawmakers voted to declare an EU-wide climate emergency in a symbolic move aimed at increasing pressure on the incoming European Commission to take a stronger stance on climate change.

On Sunday, European Parliament President David Sassoli also spoke of the need ""to turn the promises of the past few months into results that improve people's lives. From the fight against climate change to tackling the rise in the cost of living, Europeans want to see real action.''

819,"What winter? Earth just had its second-warmest December-February on record

The months of December, January and February – which meteorologists define as winter here in the Northern Hemisphere – were the second-warmest on record, federal scientists announced Friday.

Only the El Niño-fueled winter of 2015-16 was warmer, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. El Niño, a natural warming of sea water in the tropical Pacific Ocean, acts to boost global temperatures.

Global temperature records for the Earth go back to 1880.

Some of the most extreme warmth was in Russia, which smashed its record for warmest winter. Temperatures there were as much as a whopping 12 degrees above average, according to the country's weather service.

All the weird warmth messed with the region’s flora and fauna, as Gizmodo noted. Flowers started to bloom early in the winter, and some bears even awoke from hibernation at the Bolsherechensky Zoo, the Washington Post said.

In Europe, France had its warmest winter on record, while both Austria and the Netherlands had their second-warmest winter. Austria has a long history of keeping weather data: temperature records there go back to 1767, when Mozart was 11 years old.

""Record-warm December to February temperatures were observed across much of the western half of Russia and parts of Europe, eastern Asia, northern Australia and across the Atlantic, Indian and western Pacific oceans,"" NOAA said. ""However, no land or ocean areas had record-cold December to February temperatures.""

Consider this: A heat wave melted 20% of an Antarctic island's snow in only 9 days

Of course, in the Southern Hemisphere, it was summer, where the extreme warmth of Australia's second-warmest summer on record fueled devastating and deadly wildfires there.

The USA had its sixth-warmest winter on record. Every state except Alaska was warmer-than-average during the December – February months.

According to a statistical analysis done by NOAA scientists, the year 2020 is ""very likely to rank among the five-warmest years on record,"" NOAA said.

NASA, which also tracks global temperatures, also said that the winter of 2019-20 was the second-warmest on record.

The warm winter comes on the heels of the second warmest year on record (2019) and the fact that the 2010s was the warmest decade ever recorded.

Thanks to human-caused global warming, ""this period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization,"" according to the National Climate Assessment. ""Human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,"" the assessment said.

908,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson blasted Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) for blaming an entire racial group for “producing climate change,"" last week during a congressional hearing.

“She’s an unapologetic bigot, someone who attacks others for the way they were born,” Carlson said.

“There’s nothing legitimate about that; you can’t debate bigotry, it’s pure poison.”

“It’s terrifying to think that someone who spews open racism has become a role model for our young people, but that is exactly what has happened, and it’s been happening since Ocasio-Cortez arrived on the public stage.”

Ocasio-Cortez asked so-called “experts” the following questions during the hearing:

“Do we see largely that it’s the global South and communities of color that may be bearing the brunt of the initial havoc from climate change?”

“And in terms of that wealth, the people who are producing climate change, the folks that are responsible for the largest amount of emissions, or communities, or corporations, they tend to be predominantly white, correct?”

Carlson said as he highlighted Ocasio-Cortez’s bigoted statement:

“The people that are producing climate change, that’s right, those people, the ones destroying the earth, driving entire species to extinction, killing children,” Carlson said.

“Ever notice how all those people look alike? They’ve got something in common, don’t they? That’s right; they’re the same color. That’s what she’s saying.”

“For all the hysteria you hear about how the president is a racist, Donald Trump has never said anything close to that, nothing close to as bigoted and vicious as that,” Carlson added.

“The people wrecking the world are all of one race? Who talks like that? In fact, it’s hard to think of anyone in American life saying anything that disgusting and foolish and dangerous.”

Earlier this year, AOC accused Fox News of racism for calling her by the wrong name, claiming the network did it intentionally.

“By the way: Fox News likes to say my name (incorrectly) as ‘Cortez,'” she tweeted.

“Which I can only imagine is bc that sounds more ‘stereotypically’ Hispanic [and] probably incites more ‘anxiety’ for them.”

Below is the transcript of Carlson’s remarks on AOC:

""Unlike most members of Congress, Ocasio-Cortes actually believes most of what she says. It’s easy to see why young people listen to her, and in the end,, that is the problem with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It’s not her economic views, the ones that get all the attention. Yes, she’s a wild-eyed left-winger who’s pushing socialism on the country. Her ideas are maybe stupid and wrong.

""The problem is the rest of what she says, there’s a darker side to Ocasio-Cortez, and it has nothing to do with the Green New Deal.

""She’s an unapologetic bigot, someone who attacks others for the way they were born. There’s nothing legitimate about that. You can’t debate bigotry; it’s pure poison.

""It’s terrifying to think that someone who spews open racism has become a role model for our young people, but that is exactly what has happened, and it’s been happening since Ocasio-Cortez arrived on the public stage.

""During her first run for Congress last year, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that the incumbent who held the seat didn’t deserve to be in Congress because he was the wrong race. By Election Day, her opponent was literally apologizing for his own skin color. When he accused Ocasio-Cortez of making the election about race, she didn’t run from it, ‘it is about race.’

""Not so long ago, a campaign like that would have been considered deeply immoral. The press would have hounded Ocasio-Cortez until she apologized her dropped out, but not anymore. A ruling class no longer recognizes universal standards of any kind, racism they’ve decided, cuts only one way. So they ignored Ocasio-Cortez’s race-baiting, and she got elected.

""Over time, like any untreated virus, her bigotry grew more inflamed. Here was Ocasio-Cortez just last week in a public hearing explaining that actually, global climate change is the fault of a specific racial group.

""The people that are producing climate change, that’s right, those people, the ones destroying the earth, driving entire species to extinction, killing children. Ever notice how all those people look alike? They’ve got something in common, don’t they? That’s right; they’re the same color. That’s what she’s saying.

""For all the hysteria you hear about how the president is a racist, Donald Trump has never said anything close to that. Nothing close to as bigoted and vicious as that. The people wrecking the world are all of one race? Who talks like that? In fact, it’s hard to think of anyone in American life saying anything that disgusting and foolish and dangerous.

771,"When President Obama hammered out an agreement with leaders of China, India, Brazil and South Africa in the waning hours of the U.N.'s climate-change summit in Copenhagen in December, they saved the long-running global-warming negotiation process from total disintegration.

But it may have been just a stay of execution.

The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) gave all nations until Jan. 31 to sign onto the deal  in part because it was opposed by a handful of small countries  and to publicize the domestic actions they are willing to take to reduce carbon emissions.

Despite some wavering, key developing nations including China and India pledged their support for the deal, known as the Copenhagen Accord, by the deadline, reiterating their domestic plans to curb the growth of carbon emissions by improving energy efficiency. Europe, reliably, came on board with a promise to cut carbon emissions 20% below 1990 levels by 2020. And the U.S. confirmed its Copenhagen pledge to reduce its own emissions 17% below 2005 levels by 2020.

Taken at face value, the accord pledges demonstrate an international will to act on global warming and energy, even in the absence of a true international treaty. ""All the major economies are off and running,"" says Keya Chatterjee, acting director of the U.S. World Wildlife Fund's climate-change program.

But that's the optimistic view. The reality is that even though governments at Copenhagen agreed to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2°C this century, the carbon-emissions cuts they've promised are not nearly steep enough to achieve that goal. And while tens of billions of dollars have been pledged to help developing nations cut carbon and adapt to climate change, the mechanism for delivering that money isn't clear yet.

It's also looking unlikely that the U.S. Senate will pass carbon-capping legislation anytime soon  Obama lost a key vote for cap and trade when Republican Scott Brown won the late Senator Ted Kennedy's seat in a special election in Massachusetts  and that could potentially invalidate the U.S. Copenhagen pledge and throw the continuing international climate talks into further disarray. ""Unless [the U.S.] is serious about its own commitments, there will be a very serious impact on the talks,"" said Rae Kwon Chung, South Korea's ambassador on climate change.

So the story remains largely the same: the world is waiting on the U.S. Signals from the Administration suggest they may be waiting a while, though, at least when it comes to a hard carbon cap. Although Obama called for comprehensive climate and energy legislation in his recent State of the Union address, there was one term he did not use: carbon cap. And in its proposed budget for fiscal year 2011, released on Monday, the White House did not name a specific dollar figure for revenue it expects from cap and trade. Last year's budget projected $79 billion in revenue from the auction of carbon credits by 2012.

While climate legislation isn't dead by any means  it still has powerful supporters on Capitol Hill, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham  it faces an uphill battle in an election year. As a defense of last resort, the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate carbon emissions directly, but that logistically sticky tack is one Obama has repeatedly said he'd rather not use. ""There's increasing concern that if we don't get it together in the U.S., we will lose the clean-energy markets and jobs and growth that come with [a carbon cap],"" says David Doniger, policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council's climate center.

Meanwhile, international negotiations will continue this year, culminating again in the annual U.N. climate summit at year's end, to be held in Cancún, Mexico, in November. (At the very least, if thousands of attendees are forced to wait in line outside for hours, as they were in Copenhagen, they'll get a nice tan.) Further complicating any attempt at progress is the growing sense that the U.N. process itself needs to be overhauled, especially after a handful of obstructionist countries managed to slow the Copenhagen negotiations to a crawl.

A month and a half after Copenhagen, the world finds itself in much the same place it has been for over a decade, still talking about the need to strike a grand global climate bargain. ""It's fair to say that Copenhagen did not produce the full agreement the world needs to address the collective climate challenge,"" UNFCCC executive secretary Yvo de Boer told reporters on Jan. 20. ""The window of opportunity to come to grips with the issue is closing at the same rate as before."" At a minimum, the response to the Copenhagen Accord showed that the most powerful nations in the world want to do something about climate change. It's just not clear they want to do it together.

India's capital is one of the world's most polluted cities, but its skies have turned blue and many people can see the Himalaya Mountains for the first time.

In Italy's Venice, meanwhile, canal water is so clear fish can be easily seen.

All this is an unexpected upside of the coronavirus crisis that has proved global air quality can be dramatically improved - and fast.

The change has been created by lockdowns that have grounded flights and shut factories. But environmentalists warn it could be temporary.

Climate talks have been delayed to next year because of the outbreak, and there are fears countries could prioritise human and economic welfare before that of the environment.

Many are questioning whether the world will just go back to business as usual when it recovers from the pandemic.

So, moving forward, are there lessons the pandemic can teach us about living with nature?

432,"You come home from school feeling awful with a sore throat. Your mom takes your temperature with a thermometer. Within a few minutes, you hear the word fever.

But what are fevers, exactly? Why do kids get them? Why do parents and doctors care so much about them? Let's find out.

Most human beings have a body temperature of around 98.6°F (37°C). Some people will have a normal temperature that's a little higher; others will have a normal temperature that's a little lower.

Most people's body temperatures even change a little bit during the course of the day: It is usually a little lower in the morning and a little higher in the evening. For most kids, their body temperature stays pretty much the same from day to day — until germs enter the picture.

Remember that strep throat that made you feel so rotten? Or another time when the flu made you feel tired and achy? These kinds of infections are caused by germs that make their way into your body, usually in the form of bacteria (say: bak-TEER-ee-uh) or viruses.

When these germs march in and make you sick, your body's thermostat goes higher. Instead of saying your body should be 98.6°F (37°C), your body's thermostat might say that it should be 102°F (38.9°C).

Why does your body change to a new temperature? Researchers believe turning up the heat is the body's way of fighting the germs and making your body a less comfortable place for them.

A fever is also a good signal to you, your parents, and your doctor that you are sick. Without a fever, it's much harder to tell if a person has an infection. That's why grown-ups are concerned when you have a fever.

For almost all kids, fevers aren't a big problem. When the cause of the fever is treated or goes away on its own, your body temperature comes back down to normal and you feel like your old self again. Most doctors agree that many kids with a fever don't need to take any special medicine unless their fevers are making them uncomfortable.

If a kid has a higher fever and feels uncomfortable, the doctor might tell a parent to give the child medicine. The two medicines most often recommended are acetaminophen (say: uh-SEE-tuh-min-uh-fen) or ibuprofen (say: eye-byoo-PRO-fen). The medicine blocks the chemicals that tell the body to turn up the heat. Kids should never take aspirin to treat a fever because it can cause a rare but serious illness.

If you have a fever, your mom or dad will probably ask you to drink more fluids than usual. That's important because as your body heats up, it's easy for it to get dehydrated (say: dee-HI-dray-ted). This means there isn't enough water in your body. You have a lot of choices when it comes to fluids — juice, water, sports drinks, soup, flavored gelatin, and even ice pops.

Before you know it, your mom or dad will pull the thermometer out of your mouth and say, ""Your temperature is normal. No more fever!""",mainstream
476,"Confession: I enjoy reading movie reviews. I particularly enjoy reading critics who the time to rip apart a bad movie or, conversely, those who explain exactly how a movie is a masterpiece. In fact, I sometimes find myself more entertained by the criticism of a movie than the movie itself.

However, nowadays, some movies are being ripped apart for the wrong reasons. And others are being praised for the same wrong reasons. Why? Because the entire “movie critic” business is being taken over by an “agenda police” that grades movies according to their compliance to the agenda, and nothing else.

In my article about the movie Joker, I stated:

With that being said, I recently came across a review of the movie Ford v Ferrari that perfectly illustrates this fact – to a point that it is nearly infuriating. The title alone transformed my head into a giant question mark: “Ford v Ferrari depicts a generation of ‘car guys’ best left in the past”

Why would a ‘car guy’ generation be best left in the past? Why would any generation be “best left in the past” when it comes to movies? Even the worst chapters in world history can make great movies. So why should a movie about the trailblazers of the auto industry be “left in the past”? Well, according to the subtitle, it is because most of the people in the movie (and in the auto industry in the 1960s) were “white males”. And, according to the author Hannah Elliot, that fact alone makes the movie bad.

When one musters the courage the read the entire thing, this “review” of a fun movie about fast cars turns into a hateful tirade against “straight white males”, auto designer Carroll Shelby and the entire auto industry.

While I couldn’t care less about the opinion of a single movie critic, these kinds of “reviews” are becoming the norm. And the wider issue at hand is the active shunning of movies that do not pander to the agenda while underhandedly calling for censorship and the whitewashing of history.

The review was written for Bloomberg News (which is owned by Michael Bloomberg, the media mogul who is now running for U.S. President) and was published by the National Post (a major Canadian news outlet) and the auto site Driving.

The author dedicates about one sentence reviewing the actual movie to then plunge headfirst into a perplexing diatribe about hating a lot of things and people.

Then, the author explains exactly how this movie about Ford in the 1960s offended her.

The author then frowns on the roles played by women in the movie.

No fraction of the storyline is devoted to parsing the thoughts and feelings of any female who appears, even peripherally, on screen. Instead, Caitriona Balfe, who plays Miles’s wife, Mollie, is presented as the doting mother: She smiles mildly and nods her head indulgently as her husband struggles to gain traction in the race world. She clucks and scolds like a schoolmarm when Miles and Shelby come to blows on her front lawn — then brings them each a soda pop. Other women waft through the film like smoke: Secretaries in wood-paneled offices handing manila folders to men in navy suits; corporate wives smiling silently, always positioned one step behind their husbands’ shoulder; young racing fans that serve as pretty décor on racing podiums. To the victor go the spoils. The critique I heard most often about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood could easily apply here: This is a film celebrating those nostalgic golden days when white men ruled. It’s pretty to watch if you can suspend thinking for two hours about what that world must have been like for any ambitious or creative folks who didn’t fit that demographic.

Furthering away from the actual movie, the author attacks Carroll Shelby on a personal level – even bringing up unproven allegations of harassment and rape.

The man who was responsible for turning the Ford Mustang into the epitome of American muscle occupies a godlike status in car culture and embodied everything the red-blooded American male of the era was supposed to hold supreme. Shelby was a notorious womanizer who blew through six marriages and was heading toward divorce from his seventh when he died. He spoke to everyone with language so blue it was legendary; ask any car journalist or professional driver who knew him, and they’ve got plenty of descriptive words to describe the way he treated anyone within earshot. Many of those words are unprintable here. For fun, he shot lions, elephants, and rhinoceroses on animal hunts in Africa. He filed so many lawsuits — against Ford, against local car builders, against online forums, and, ironically, against the company that later would supply all of the Cobras for the film — that he become more known and reported on for that in his later years than for any feats of automotive genius. In fact, after his blast of success with the AC Cobras in the 1960s and his hot-rod take on the Ford Mustang, Shelby didn’t have a single real hit. Instead, there were claims he falsely represented many of the cars he sold. He left Ford for Chrysler, where he helped develop some special-edition Dodges. Ford fans brought up to adore him as a brand hero shouldn’t have been so surprised he left; this was not an individual known for loyalty to anyone or anything other than himself. It gets worse: One of his former personal assistants, Angelica Smith, sued Shelby for sexual harassment in 2011. The suit included information about an alleged rape that happened at Shelby’s home by one of his employees, and that she was fired, partly in retaliation, after she reported it. (Shelby called the allegations “wild and fantastical” at the time; he died less than a year later.) But that particular anecdote has been washed almost entirely clean by the same boys-club car culture that idolizes Steve McQueen, a decent actor who died conveniently early and had a habit of hitting his wives.

Straying even further away from the movie, the author ends up complaining about the lack of women executives in car companies such as Kia and Toyota.

It’s no surprise to survey this patriarchal wasteland — but it’s no less depressing to see it, nonetheless. The epic portrayed remains uncomfortably close to how the car world is today. We still have to look hard to find women of consequence. Six of GM’s 11 global board members are women, an admirable percentage. But the numbers are worse elsewhere. At Toyota, just 13% of board members are women; Hyundai and Kia have no women in any position as high as vice president. The auto industry lags behind the rest of the world: women in corporate America at large occupy 21% of C-suite offices, 30% of VP-level roles and 38% of managerial roles, while the auto industry places women in 13% of C-suites, 18% of VP-level spots, and 20% of managerial positions, according to Catalyst, a nonprofit that advocates for women in industry. This isn’t good enough. Today car companies face difficult questions about brand identity and mobility — concepts they’ve never had to contemplate before now. They are evaluating who they are — there’s that question again — in a world increasingly oriented toward mobility rather than mechanical transport, electric motors rather than V8 engines.

How did a movie review about Matt Damon racing cars ended up criticizing business practices in Japan and South Korea? She even calls the industry a “patriarchal wasteland”. Here’s a crazy thought: Maybe there’s a low percentage of women in the car industry because there’s a low percentage of women who are interested in cars in general?

The “review” generated hundreds of comments on each site it was posted on. Nearly all of the comments (many of them written by women) bash the critic senseless.

Hannah Elliot’s “review” couldn’t be more superficial. It solely focused on the sex, the skin color and the sexual orientation of the characters in the movie (which are based on actual people). And therein lies the hypocrisy of the “diversity gurus” of the modern age: Instead of judging people by who they are, they judge people by what they are.

This hypocrisy is being applied to movie reviews: Instead of judging a movie by what it is, they are judged by who’s in them. Are there enough LGBTQ+? Are there enough “strong” feminist women? Are there enough minorities? What percentage of words are said by each group? Movies are now evaluated on these criteria. And this is killing the movie industry. And maybe that’s what they want.

1230,"Climate change is melting ice, intensifying storms and bleaching coral reefs, and now, a new study suggests that it could also take a toll on babies' hearts.

The study, published yesterday (Jan. 30) in the Journal of the American Heart Association, suggests that, starting in 2025, extreme heat brought on by climate change could increase the number of babies born with heart defects in the United States. The greatest increase would be seen in the Midwest, followed by the Northeast and the South, researchers reported.

Congenital heart defects, or heart abnormalities that infants are born with, affect around 40,000 newborns every year in the U.S., according to a statement from the American Heart Association. [7 Ways Pregnant Women Affect Babies]

It's unclear why a pregnant woman's heat exposure can lead to a congenital heart defect in a baby, but animal studies suggest that heat could cause cell death in fetuses and interact with heat-sensitive proteins that are important in development, according to the statement.

An earlier study from the same group of researchers found that women's exposure to high temperatures during pregnancy was linked to an increased risk of congenital heart defects in babies. The study included women who gave birth between 1997 and 2007.

In this new study, the researchers combine that data with climate change temperature projections.

The team built upon climate change forecasts gathered by NASA and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. They simulated changes in daily maximum temperatures for various geographic regions in the U.S. and calculated how much heat and extreme heat events pregnant women would be exposed to in the spring and summer.

Between 2025 and 2035, they found that climate-change-driven heat events might spur an additional 7,000 cases of congenital heart defects, according to the statement. They found that most of these cases would be in the Midwest, followed by the Northeast and the South.

""Although this study is preliminary, it would be prudent for women in the early weeks of pregnancy to avoid heat extremes similar to the advice given to persons with cardiovascular and pulmonary disease during heart spells,"" senior author Dr. Shao Lin, an associate director of environmental health services with the University at Albany, State University of New York, said in the statement.

It's especially important for those planning to become pregnant or those who are three to eight weeks pregnant to avoid extreme heat, she said.

Live Science previously reported that pregnant women who are exposed to heat during early pregnancy can develop hyperthermia, or extremely high body temperature, which increases the risk of having babies with defects of the brain or spinal cord.

882,"Cold weather can take a toll on your body. As temperatures drop, so does the moisture content in your skin. This can lead to a winter rash. A winter rash is an area of irritated skin. It’s most often caused by dry skin. Even if you have healthy skin the rest of the year, you may develop a winter rash during cold seasons. The condition is common and often recurs year after year. Most people who live in cold climates have experienced it at least once.

Without treatment and lifestyle changes, your rash may last throughout winter. Fortunately, there are ways to keep your skin healthy and moisturized year-round.

A winter rash may include any of the following symptoms:

The rash may impact a single area of your body, often your legs, arms, or hands. In other cases, it may be widespread on your body.

Anyone can get a winter rash, but some people are more prone than others. You’re more likely to develop a winter rash if you have a history of:

Spending a lot of time outdoors may also raise your risk of developing a winter rash.

Possible Causes of a Winter Rash

Your skin’s outer layer contains natural oils and dead skin cells that hold water inside your skin. This helps keep your skin soft, moisturized, and smooth.

Bitter cold temperatures can affect the condition of your skin. Cold air, low humidity, and high winds outdoors strip your skin of much-needed moisture. Turning up the heat and taking hot showers indoors do the same. These harsh conditions cause your skin to lose its natural oils. This allows moisture to escape, leading to dry skin and potentially a winter rash.

Other possible causes of a winter rash include:
• sensitivity to antibacterial soaps, deodorizing soaps, detergents, or other chemicals
• skin conditions, such as psoriasis or eczema

Sunburns can also lead to a winter rash. The sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays can be potent, even in winter. In fact, according to The Skin Cancer Foundation, snow reflects up to 80 percent of UV light, which means can be hit by the same rays twice. UV rays are also more intense at higher altitudes. This is important to remember if you enjoy snowboarding, skiing, or other alpine sports.

Your doctor can often diagnose a winter rash during a physical exam. They’ll review your symptoms and medical history to help determine the cause of your rash and prescribe treatment.

If you haven’t changed your soap or exposed your skin to chemicals recently, chances are your rash is due to dry skin. If you’re moisturizing your skin regularly and limiting your exposure to extreme cold or hot temperatures, something else may be causing your rash. It’s possible you’re experiencing an allergic reaction to a personal care product or medication. You may also have an infection or skin condition, such as eczema, psoriasis, or dermatitis.

Most treatments for a winter rash are inexpensive and don’t require a prescription. For example:
• Moisturizers are often the first defense against a winter rash because they help lock moisture into your skin. Apply moisturizer several times a day, especially after bathing and hand washing.
• Petroleum jelly also acts as a barrier to help seal moisture into your skin. If you don’t like the idea of using petroleum products, consider trying petroleum substitutes, such as Waxelene or Un-Petroleum, which also prevent moisture loss.
• Natural oils, such as olive oil and coconut oil, may help soothe your irritated skin and replenish moisture. Apply to your skin as needed.
• Vegetable shortening is another popular folk remedy for dry skin because its solid oil content helps restore moisture. Try slathering it on after bathing or before bed.
• Bathing with milk may help soothe your itchy skin. Dip a clean washcloth into whole milk and dab it on the affected area of your body, or soak in a warm bath with milk added for about 10 minutes.
• Oatmeal soap and baths may also help soothe your skin. Purchase soap made with oatmeal, or add finely ground oats to a warm bath, and soak in it for about 10 minutes.
• Topical cortisone creams, which are available with or without a prescription, may help reduce your skin’s redness, itching, and inflammation. Follow the manufacturer’s directions or use as directed by your doctor.

Most winter rashes improve with lifestyle changes, home remedies, and over-the-counter (OTC) treatments. Others may persist or get worse. Scratching may cause your skin to crack and bleed. This gives bacteria the perfect opening and puts you at risk of infection.

Contact your doctor if you have a rash that isn’t responding to OTC treatments, is bleeding, or has severe symptoms.

The best way to prevent winter rash is to avoid cold climates and dry air entirely. Try these prevention tips if you don’t spend your winter in a warm climate:
• Invest in a humidifier to add moisture to the air around you. Whole-house, single-room, and personal humidifiers are available. Find a great selection on Amazon.com.
• Bathe less often, lather up at little as possible, and avoid hot water. Consider bathing every other day during the winter, when your body may not sweat as much or get as dirty.
• Use natural, fragrance-free soaps made from glycerin, goat milk, shea butter, or olive oil.
• Wear clothes made from breathable natural fibers, such as cotton and hemp, to help reduce skin irritation and overheating.
• Protect your hands by wearing gloves every time you go outside in cold weather. You should also wear protective gloves when you wash dishes, immerse your hands in water for an extended period, or clean with chemical products.
• Prevent winter sunburns by wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen that has an SPF of 30 or higher when you spend time outdoors.

Limit the time you spend in front of fires, which decrease humidity and expose your skin to intense heat.

Taking preventive steps and applying moisturizer at the first sign of dry skin, can help you reduce your risk of a winter rash.

Some winter rashes are just a nuisance. Other rashes are more serious and require medical treatment. Contact your doctor if your rash doesn’t improve despite home treatment or you have other concerns about your rash.",mainstream

From England to Jamaica to the United States, we are hearing from artists and activists around the world about what we can do locally, globally, and everywhere in between.

Jane Fonda is no stranger of fighting for what she believes in. The Oscar-winning actress has spent the past 50 years on the front lines of progressive causes, protesting wars from Vietnam to Iraq, the war on women’s bodies, and wars on Native American land and water.

She’s also been spending her time protesting the war being waged against the planet. Fonda’s organization Fire Drill Fridays, in the tradition of Greta Thunberg’s School Strike for Climate Fridays, is organizing civil disobedience for climate once a week, with gatherings now happening digitally due to COVID-19. “There’s so much that people can do from home that will really matter,” says Fonda.

Fonda says that for the planet to survive, we need to cut fossil-fuel emissions in half by 2030 and start to phase out fossil fuels to net zero by 2050.

“That’s the key thing. And in the process of doing that, we have to make sure that workers, families, and communities that are affected by this massive switch to a new energy system get paid union wages with full benefits as they make that transition to comparable new jobs. This is what’s called a just transition,” says Fonda.

And in order for that to happen, Fonda says, “Everybody has to be at the table” — which includes workers and their unions, industries, and state and local governments, supported by federal government resources.

Fonda argues that pressure from people is what will make this possible. “We have to demand that the new president, whoever he is (it looks like it will be a him), has to use his executive power starting Day One to make this happen, while simultaneously investing in clean, renewable energy systems,” she says. “This isn’t going to happen unless enough people are mobilized to force that president to do what’s needed. We have to force him. And that’s why Fire Drill Fridays are important.”

Fonda points to a range of actions she’s been able to take at home to help alleviate climate change, like switching to an electric car, getting an electric stove, using solar panels, moving away from single-use plastics, and generally shopping and consuming less. But she says that’s just the start.

“The truth is, all the individual actions together can’t be scaled up in time to make the fundamental difference in fossil-fuel emissions that we need,” warns Fonda. “That’s why governments are so important.”

218,"Former frontline CIA Officer Scott Uehlinger says Hillary Clinton clearly broke the law with her private unprotected server. Uehlinger explains, “What the Clintons rely on is most Americans don’t really understand the security procedures. So, they can throw up a lot of smoke and mirrors that confuses people and makes them think that this was not so much of a problem. But people in the military and people in the intelligence community understand this better, and certainly it is even worse than it appears. . . . The fact that she set up a private server, in and of itself, means she is guilty of a felony right there. Obviously, by having a private server, she was conspiring to evade her signed sworn statements that she would uphold secrecy agreements. The fact that she simply established that (private server) regardless of what was on it, she intended to go around and circumvent the law. Now, we had more than 100 highly classified emails on the server, and the fact that this server is absolutely vulnerable to any Chinese, Russian or Iranian hacking, this is the greatest disaster or mishandling of classified information at the upper levels of the U.S. government in history. There is no question about it.”

Does Uehlinger think Clinton’s private server was hacked? Uehlinger says, “I would virtually guarantee that with 95% certainty it was hacked. There is almost no question about it.”

What about the mishandling of classified information that General David Petraeus plead guilty to last year? Is this the same level of security breach? Uehlinger says, “We don’t know exactly what he gave out, but there has been talk in the press that his schedule was given out. People of that level, even their schedules are classified information. We cannot even begin to compare the damage of General Petraeus’ schedule, which is obsolete after a week or so, compared to highly sensitive information (on Clinton’s private server) that involve U.S. technical means . . . that’s so high in classification that the FBI agents investigating her case were not allowed to see. This is a quantum leap in mishandling of classified information far and above anything that Petraeus did, and look at what was done to him, and compare that to the present inaction going on with Hillary Clinton’s case.”

On Iran’s recent public push for ballistic missile development, Uehlinger, who is a 20 year CIA veteran and is an expert on Russia and Iran, says, “None of this is a surprise to people like us. However, this is a surprise to this administration, which just has a willful blindness and an ideology it sticks to and doesn’t want to hear anything to the contrary. They wanted to conclude something with Iran, and it was done, even though all evidence pointing to this would be a disaster. It’s an absolute disaster. It’s unconscionable that you can have a non-agreement agreement and release money seized by the international community since 1979 . . . and unfreeze that, and the Iranians have admitted they are going to use some of that money for terrorist activity. They are progressing with their missile activity and threatening the United States for daring to criticize them. . . .They are going to increase the chances for war in the Middle East, not decrease it.”

Uehlinger, who is also running to be a Republican delegate in Pennsylvania, says Hillary not being charged may be to the advantage of the GOP come November. Uehlinger explains, “I have talked to some whose fear, their fear is that she will be charged. If this happened at the 11th hour, what might happen is Biden might be put up. I know people who have greater fear of Biden running against either Cruz or Trump than Hillary. It might be the best thing for the Republican Party for Hillary to remain where she is as a candidate because she can be defeated.”

1252,"OFFICIAL death records are not reflecting the actual amount of deaths caused by the climate crisis, according to a new study.

A team of Australian health experts claim there is a ""substantial under-reporting of heat-related mortality"".

Excessive heat is said to be the most dominant risk posed by climate change in Australia.

However, experts from The Australian National University claim that deaths attributed to heat are ""at least 50 times more"" than what is stated on official death certificates.

Dr Arnagretta Hunter, from the ANU Medical School, said: ""Climate change is a killer, but we don’t acknowledge it on death certificates.

""There is second component on a death certificate which allows for pre-existing conditions and other factors.

""If you have an asthma attack and die during heavy smoke exposure from bushfires, the death certificate should include that information.""

The researchers want death certification to be modernised so it can reflect large-scale environmental events.

Over the past 11 years, official figures are said to show 340 deaths in Australia were attributed to excessive heat.

However, statistical analysis has found that the real figure could be as high as 36,765 deaths.

Dr Hunter said: ""We know the summer bushfires were a consequence of extraordinary heat and drought and people who died during the bushfires were not just those fighting fires – many Australians had early deaths due to smoke exposure.""

The study authors argue that climate change deaths need to be recorded properly so that the true scale of the crisis can be understood.

They say this is imperative for many countries all over the world.

This year has already seen raging wildfires in Australia, which were said to be fuelled by high temperatures.

Last year also saw the devastating impact of the fires along with those in areas like California and even the Arctic.

The hottest June ever recorded on Earth saw huge wildfires spreading from Greenland to Siberia to Alaska.

Hot, dry weather combined with drought and strong winds create the perfect conditions for fire to spread quickly.

The Australian bushfires resulted in the loss of over half a billion animals.

This research was published in The Lancet Planetary Health.

In other news, a tectonic plate under the Indian Ocean is slowly breaking in two, according to a new study.

Climate change could render a fifth of the planet as hot as the Sahara Desert by 2070, according to a new study.

352,"(CNN) Humans have damaged around a quarter of ice-free land on Earth, United Nations scientists warned in a major report Thursday, stressing that further degradation must be stopped to prevent catastrophic global warming .

The warning comes almost a year after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in a landmark report that we only have until 2030 to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and prevent the planet from reaching the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

The second IPCC report highlights the vicious cycle of climate change and land degradation.

""We humans affect more than 70% of ice-free land, a quarter of this land is degraded. The way we produce food and what we eat contributes to the loss of natural ecosystems and declining biodiversity,"" said Valérie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the IPCC.

Deforestation and agriculture also fuel global warming, by weakening land's capacity to draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases.

""When land is degraded, it reduces the soils ability to take up carbon and this exacerbates climate change. In turn, climate change exacerbates land degradation in many different ways. Today 500 million people live in areas that experience desertification,"" Masson-Delmotte said.

But the report does offer hope, there are major opportunities to reverse the damage, the IPCC notes.

Here are five key takeaways from the IPCC report:

Land the size of South America has been degraded

Human use takes up over 70% of the world's ice-free land surface, according to the IPCC report.

They degrade the planet's natural resources, with chemical fertilizers, deforestation and intensive farming. In the process, humans have damaged two billion hectares of land, the size of South America.

As a result, this land is less fertile and captures smaller quantities of carbon emissions from the atmosphere, according to Stephen Cornelius, the World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) chief advisor on climate change.

""The way we use land is driving the climate crisis,"" he told CNN. ""Ecosystem conversion releases greenhouse gas emissions.

Land use, including agriculture and deforestation, produces almost a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.

We need to stop wasting food and eat less meat

The IPCC report stresses that food waste and meat consumption will need to be reduced if we want to slash global emissions.

Both are big contributors to global warming -- with food waste producing between 8-10% and livestock 14.5% of global emissions, according to WWF.

According to the report, 25-30% of all food produced is never eaten, while 821 million worldwide are undernourished.

If food waste was a country, it would be the third largest emitter after the US and China, according to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), a non-profit working to reduce global waste.

""The fact that more than one billion tonnes of food never gets consumed while one in nine people go to bed hungry is a travesty,"" said Claire Kneller, head of food at WRAP.

If the United Nations goal of halving food waste by 2030 is to be met, countries should start measuring waste and adopt their own reduction goal, according to Kneller.

""We will not tackle the impact of climate change if we do not fix our global food system,"" she said.

We need to restore natural carbon sinks

Forests and wetlands are important carbon sinks, but have been greatly diminished by human activities, the IPCC warns, and their ability to capture carbon could continue to decrease depending on human actions.

Between 2007-2016, land removed 29% of total CO2 emissions from the atmosphere.

Peatlands -- a type of wetlands -- can hold carbon for centuries, but more intense droughts, floods and wildfires could trigger the release of carbon from the soil.

Sustainable soil management and agroforestry are key solutions that ""deliver carbon sequestration in soil or vegetation,"" the report notes.

Land restoration ""represents a fantastic opportunity to draw down carbon from the atmosphere,"" Cornelius said.

""The food system is both a leading cause and a casualty of climate change,"" according to Joao Campari, who leads WWF's global food practice.

Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, which destroy crops and critical farming infrastructure.

It's not just extreme weather that is threatening farming -- climate change is also changing what types of crops can grow in certain locations by making it too hot or too dry.

Campari told CNN the food system must ""urgently"" be reformed to avoid catastrophic global warming.

Food production uses 34% of land worldwide and contributes up to 75% of deforestation, he said.

To stave off the worst effects of climate change, humans need to stop converting land and destroying the soil with fertilizers and by cutting down trees, said Campari, adding that we already have enough farmland to feed the global population.

Bioenergy is not the answer

In its report last year, the IPCC warned that keeping global temperatures at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, using techniques such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).

But in its latest report, the IPCC said that quickly rolling out this technology on a large scale ""could greatly increase demand for land conversion.""

Ramping up bioenergy production through the use of fertilizers and irrigation could erode soil, increase water scarcity and threaten food security, the report notes.

Claudia Ringler, deputy director at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), told CNN that biofuels are not a scalable solution.

The world would have to convert 7.2 million square kilometers, 45% of the Earth's cropland, into bioenergy crops to keep global temperatures at 1.5°C, according to the most energy-intensive scenario outlined in the 2018 IPCC report.

""It's not possible, not at the rate they are proposing,"" Ringler said, explaining that the conversion of this much land would lead to a huge spike in global food prices and drive insecurity.",mainstream

43,"We've made great strides in Derbyshire over the last 2 years but there is always so much more we can and should do.

We're tackling unnecessary waste, reducing emissions from our street lighting by 63% and overall emissions from our operations by 48% since 2010, actively supporting new electric vehicle charging points across the county and introducing measures to reduce single-use plastics across the council.

In May 2019, we published a series of carbon reduction pledges which takes our commitments a step further and makes a strong public statement – one to which the people of Derbyshire can hold us accountable.
• reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our buildings and operations by 55% by 2022 compared to 2010
• work with borough and district councils, utilities and property developers to champion eco-homes fit for the future and to help communities and businesses become less dependent on energy
• work with Derbyshire businesses and local government partners in China, Japan, India and other countries to reduce carbon emissions in business and tourism activities
• support renewable energy generation, both large scale and microgeneration, on our land and buildings and in our communities working alongside partners such as D2N2 and the Midlands Energy Hub
• promote energy efficiency, including reducing energy use in older buildings and through the use of smart technology
• support low carbon businesses to establish and flourish in Derbyshire, creating new jobs across the county
• foster green energy entrepreneurs to develop renewable or zero carbon energy production
• attract companies into Derbyshire who will carry out research and development and upskill the workforce in partnership with universities and training providers
• use our buying power to support businesses and schools to become more sustainable
• support and promote the development of low carbon travel and low emission vehicles, introduce electric vehicles into our fleet and explore opportunities for low carbon fuels for HGVs
• develop, through our close partnerships with district and borough councils, solutions that minimise waste, particularly food waste and single-use plastics, and increase recycling
• ensure we buy and use goods which are more sustainable and can be reused or recycled and wherever possible waste products are used to benefit the local economy
• call on the UK government to ensure the level of investment and national planning regulations support our ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Derbyshire
• produce further targets and objectives for carbon reduction, within 6 months, after considering latest recommendations made to the UK government

In November 2019, Cabinet members approved 2 new carbon reduction policies including plans to become carbon neutral by 2032.

Read our media release about our plans to become carbon neutral.

In leading by example and bringing together local people, voluntary groups, other councils and businesses to tackle climate change we believe we'll win hearts and minds and work to put climate change on everyone’s agenda in Derbyshire.

Heat networks form an important part of the government’s plan to reduce carbon emissions and cut heating bills for public, domestic and commercial sectors.

They are considered one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing carbon emissions from heating and provide a unique opportunity to exploit larger scale – and often lower cost – renewable and recovered heat sources that otherwise cannot be used.

A heat network is a distribution system of insulated and buried pipes that takes energy, typically heat, from a central source and delivers it to a number of domestic or non-domestic buildings. The heat source could be a combined heat and power plant. Or heat recovered from industry and urban infrastructure, canals, rivers and mine water, or energy from waste plants which may otherwise be released to the atmosphere. The heat distributed through the network can be used by customers to heat space and water.

With funding support from the Heat Networks Delivery Unit, we've completed a heat mapping and energy master planning study for Derbyshire. This is the first stage into investigating the feasibility of developing heat networks in the county.

700,"New research says that some bee species could vanish within a few decades

According to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science, bumblebee species are drastically declining — possibly risking extinction — due to the world’s heightened climate crisis.

Findings suggest that due to climate change, the odds of seeing a bumblebee in North America and Europe have declined by an average of 30 percent.

Researchers at the University of Ottowa explained that while “climate chaos” being “related to the growing extinction risk that animals are facing around the world” is not a relatively new theory, bumblebees especially are disappearing at a consistent rate.

“If declines continue at this pace, many of these species could vanish forever within a few decades,” first author Peter Soroye said.

To examine the effects of climate change, researchers analyzed changes in the populations of 66 bumblebee species over North America and Europe in relation to the changing temperature.

“We found that populations were disappearing in areas where the temperatures had gotten hotter,” Soroye explained.

“Using our new measurement of climate change, we were able to predict changes both for individual species and for whole communities of bumblebees with a surprisingly high accuracy.”

Scientists discovered that the bees preferred cooler, wet conditions and variations in seasons. As the rising temperatures are drying out habitats, this could be raising the risk of extinction and lack of colonization.

“Colonization is when an animal goes to a new place and there was no population of that animal there before, and it establishes a new population,” senior author Dr. Jeremy Kerr said. “If that’s happening a lot, then the species might be doing okay.”

As the study explained, “bumblebees are among the best pollinators we have in the wildlife system,” so researchers are eager to keep bees alive and thriving. To help with this goal, the study offered suggestions of ways anyone can help protect the bees.

Some of these options include lessening the use of pesticides, providing shelter from the sun for the species and to plant a diverse arrangement of flowers to save all types of habitats.

Added Kerr: “There are things we can do and recovery is a feasible thing, We’re not saying that what we all need to do is immediately start living in a hut in the woods to recover the situation. It points to a hopeful direction if we choose to intervene.”",mainstream
971,"A group of citizens in Ethiopia joined together earlier this week to plant 350 million trees. The impressive feat took place over the course of one day and is part of a larger campaign to counteract the effects of climate change and deforestation.

Getahun Mekuria, Ethiopia’s minister for innovation and technology, announced on Twitter that the nation had planted 353 million trees in just 12 hours. (WOW – that is incredible!) Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is leading the campaign, whose goal is to plant a total of close to four billion trees. The initiative is asking each citizen to plant at least 40 seedlings this summer.
• New Filipino Law Requires All Students to Plant 10 Trees Before They Can Graduate

The well-coordinated effort aims to help with climate change in a nation that is plagued by droughts. The United Nations has indicated that forest coverage in Ethiopia has declined by close to 30 percent from the early 20th century to the early 2000s. In the early part of the 21st century, about four percent of the country was covered by forests.

Ethiopia broke a world record when they planted 353 million trees in one day. The previous record occurred in India, when, in 2016, volunteers planted fifty million trees in a single day.
• Trees Are Dying Off at an Alarming Rate With Little Public Attention

The tree planting was a group effort, with staff from the African Union, the United Nations, and foreign embassies in Ethiopia pitching in. Dr. Dan Ridley-Ellis, the head of the Centre for Wood Science and Technology at Edinburgh Napier University, told The Guardian:

“This truly impressive feat is not just the simple planting of trees, but part of a huge and complicated challenge to take account of the short- and long-term needs of both the trees and the people. The forester’s mantra ‘the right tree in the right place’ increasingly needs to consider the effects of climate change, as well as the ecological, social, cultural and economic dimension.”

We agree with Dr. Ridley-Ellis, and commend Ethiopia and its citizens for their significant contribution towards taking care of Mother Earth.

Members:

The climate task force is a task force of the whole council, which includes members from business, government, environmental and civic organizations. 

 Climate Change Task Force Member List 



History:

The task force decided to focus on four areas of policy development:
• Climate Change Principles. These principles provide the Council with a shared statement on climate change and guide the Council's more in-depth discussions of climate change policies and approaches. View Principles.
• Technology Working Group. This group examined the various types of technologies that are currently available, under development, or anticipated that could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as examined various policies or incentives that could foster the development and dissemination of these technologies in this country and abroad. Working Group Tri-chairs: General Motors, World Resources Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy
• Working Group on Economic, Regulatory, and Voluntary Measures. This group examined a broad range of economic instruments, regulatory approaches, and voluntary steps that could be taken to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. These could include tradeable permits; tax credits/deductions for investing in improved technologies; carbon taxes; mitigation measures for economic or regional dislocations; partnerships among the investment and insurance communities, government, and industry; various regulatory approaches; and voluntary initiatives.
• Working Group on Cross-cutting Policies. Policies were identified to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases while also furthering progress in other areas of sustainable development. This working group provided a focus for drawing linkages between the Climate Change Task Force and the Council's other task forces (Environmental Management, Metropolitan/Rural Strategies for Sustainable Communities, and International) and for identifying those policies that may have benefits in more than one area. Other areas of activity include:
• Demonstrating the Implementation of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Policies and Activities
• Public outreach activities including community forums, the creation of a website, providing information to the media, and giving speeches and presentations on climate change policies and activities.
• Working with the Council's Evaluating Progress Working Group to identify indicators and measures for tracking progress in addressing the issue of climate change.

Progress Report: 

The Climate task force sent a letter to the President in November 1997 (Press Release 11/26/97) outlining its first product: a set of climate principles which were agreed upon to help the task force in its policy deliberations. In the letter, the co-chairs of the Council stated: ""This consensus statement about climate policy from industry, environmental, citizen and state and local leaders is, as far as we are aware, the first such agreement on climate policy."" The principles call for incentives for early action, international commitments, accountability, flexibility, strong measures to encourage technology, and fairness. 



 Working group meetings began in February 1998.
• 1. The Working groups developed a set of recommendations to accelerate the development and deployment of climate-friendly technology, principles for early action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and identified steps that could be taken to foster broad-based community participation to realize the benefits of climate protection. 



 2. The Climate Task Force transmitted the Early Action Principles to the President (Transmittal Letter to the President) in October 1998. See Fact Sheet and Press Release

God and healthy mothers doesn't do revenge, which was why he used that term instead of Mother Earth, and they couldn't use a vengeful God as they promote Atheism religiously. Useful for to hide behind.]

This is BAAL not Mother Earth

 Just as the human body uses a fever to fight off an infection, Gaia is raising Her temperature to expel a harmful parasite  humans. Unless humans renounce their destructive ways and rejoin the diverse community of living beings in Gaias loving embrace then Gaia will be forced to act in order to secure Her supreme reign. the human population will be reduced to a few breeding pairs by the end of this century.""--Lovelock

""By the end of this century climate change will reduce the human population to a few breeding pairs surviving near the Arctic."" - Sir James Lovelock, Revenge of Gaia

""According to what I've picked up by hanging around Indians is that their cultures revere the planet and everything on and in it, which isn't the same as the sort of Babylonian cult that Lovelock sponsors. The latter seems to be based on human sacrifice, which is the basis of what passes for religion with the Illuminati hives. Most Indians, like most anyone else, find human sacrifice to be repugnant and anti-spiritual. They also didn't focus much on the spherical 'earth' entity but rather seemed more concerned about the world around them. 

 The infantile 'Gaia Hypothesis' treats the globe itself as a willful, petulant and vengeful entity that needs to be placated by sacrificing the 'ingrates' on it. I credit Theosophists with the skill needed to put a lovely face on this horror story with appropriate pseudomystical doublespeak. If you want to see some less saccharine Theosophical preaching, read some of the anti-population literature published by their Lucifer (they changed that telling name to 'Lucis' but I'm calling a spade a spade) Trust for the United Nations. 

 I've long had the impression that these few very old families (I refer to them as 'hives,' rather), who owned the corporate world order until the Chinese bought them out, descend directly from Babylonian families, hence the continuity of their beliefs and practices. 

 Their practices don't seem at all like the Roman ones, which only used part of the Babylonian paradigm--mixed in with Greek, Persian, Egyptian and other practices. The inclusion of the Babylonian Dagon (fish god--origin of 'the pope') worship with Mithraism (consider the Mithraic-ritual snuff film, PASSION OF THE CHRIST) and Helenism as the basis for modern Christian dogma is a clear example of Roman religion and the less adulterated Moloch (Babylonian owl god) human sacrifice rituals at Bohemian Grove are a case in point for how the Illuminati apply Babylonian infantilism as a distinct belief system, I think. The Gaia model lines up pretty clearly with the latter, in my view.""--Don Croft",conspiracy
781,"The impacts of climate change on human health are predicted to be unfavourable, varied, and disproportionately affect the most vulnerable population groups who are most exposed and least able to adapt. Likely impacts in many countries include those associated with extreme weather events and natural disasters, lack of sufficient quantities and quality of fresh water, impacts of compromised food security, and increased incidence of communicable diseases including vectorborne diseases.

Vectorborne diseases such as malaria, dengue, tick-borne diseases and plague are particularly susceptible for a number of reasons: the geographical distribution and behaviour of vectors and their hosts are intimately associated with environmental determinants, and transmission dynamics tend to favour warmer, wetter environments. Human responses to climate change, such as increased urbanization following farming failures and storage of water for household use, may also place populations at risk of vectorborne diseases.

Member States of the WHO Western Pacific Region have endorsed resolutions and developed national adaptation programmes of action and other climate change vulnerability analyses and plans to address and respond to climate change and health threats. WHO Western Pacific Regional Office works closely with Member states to build capacity at country and regional levels to minimize the consequences of vectorborne diseases for populations in areas that are prone to climate change.

556,"Greta Thunberg Threatens to Put World Leaders “Against the Wall” if They Refuse to Fight Climate Change

Greta Thunberg threatened to put world leaders “against the wall” if they refuse to comply with climate change demands.

During a speech in Turin, Italy, the teenage climate change activist stated, “Unfortunately, we probably already know the outcome. World leaders are still trying to run away from their responsibilities but we have to make sure they cannot do that.”

“We will make sure that we put them against the wall and they will have to do their job to protect our futures,” she added.

The term to put someone “against the wall” has been used by Communists and other authoritarians throughout history to denote assassinating political enemies.

If anyone prominent on the right had used such rhetoric, there’d be a huge outcry with immediate demands for censorship.

Greta, who this week was named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year, has been elevated into something of a cult leader over the past year thanks to the media’s relentless fawning over her.

As we previously highlighted, Thunberg is being taught to Swedish children as part of a course about “religious knowledge,” with kids being asked to mock her opponents.

Churches in Sweden are now ringing bells in her honor, while last year the Church of Sweden proclaimed Greta to be “Jesus’s Successor.”

Greta also appeared on a giant looming mural in San Francisco appearing precisely as you would expect a cult leader to look.

1184,"GRETA Thunberg is not your average teenager, whilst most young girls her age were worrying about fashion and make-up, she was confronting climate issues and trying to change the world.

But the climate-change activist has hit the headlines today for the wrong reasons as she fears she and dad Svante have been infected by the coronavirus. This has not been confirmed, however.

In an interview with New Scientist, the climate change campaigner said they had both experienced some symptoms of coronavirus after a recent train tour around Europe together.

The pair were travelling before restrictions were imposed in several countries.

The teenager stressed however that neither of them have been tested for the virus because Sweden is only testing people with the most severe symptoms and those in at-risk groups.

Greta Thunberg is the Swedish teenager who skipped school to protest and sparked a international climate change revolution in the process.

Aged just 17, Greta rose to global notoriety in May 2018, when she began protesting outside Swedish parliament demanding that they take action to meet the carbon emissions target agreed by world leaders in 2015.

Her protests-which she would resume every Friday instead of going to school, went viral on social media where support for her cause grew, this sparked similar protests around the world which were spread with the hashtag #FridaysForFuture.

Greta also has Asperger's syndrome, a developmental disorder, which she hasn't let stop her on her mission, instead she has used it as a driving force describing it as a 'superpower.'

When was Greta Thunberg named Time Magazine Person of the Year?

In December 2019, the Swedish-born activist was announced as Time Magazine's 2019 Person of the Year.

She is the youngest person ever to receive the accolade at 16 and has become a global icon for speaking out on climate change.

Greta featured on the cover of the magazine standing on a rocky shore, with splashing waves.

The headline: ""The Power Of Youth"" was emblazoned on it, as was the name of the award.

In the magazine, she is quoted as saying: ""I’d like to tell my grandchildren that we did everything we could.

 ""And we did it for them — for the generations to come.”

What is Greta Thunberg's relationship with Extinction Rebellion?

Greta and the global environment movement Extinction Rebellion have built a relationship over the years as they demand action from global leaders about climate change.

Although their methods to effect change differ, the message is the same-the world has to wake up and deal with the ever-growing climate threat.

Their relationship was strengthened in April 2019 when Greta came to London to deliver a speech to the climate activists in Marble Arch, telling the crowd,""we will make sure politicians don't get away with it any longer.""

In a further show of support for the group, on October 7, 2019 they planned a protest and the police brought in a ban to stop them, she voiced her support for the campaign.

Through social media platform Twitter, Greta tweeted saying: ""If standing up against the climate and ecological breakdown and for humanity is against the rules then the rules must be broken.""

Why did she travel across the Atlantic on a 'zero carbon' yacht?

The young activist sailed across the Atlantic in a “zero carbon” yacht to attend the UN climate action summit in August 2019.

She made the two-week voyage in the state-of-the-art 60ft Malizia II yacht - one of the fastest ocean sailing boats on the planet.

The £4m boat - skippered by Boris Herrmann - was fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines that produce electricity on board, with the aim of making the journey zero-carbon.

The non-stop journey eco warrior Greta made is - in theory - the lowest-carbon option to cross the Atlantic.

What did she say at the UN Climate action summit?

Greta delivered an impassioned speech to world leaders at the summit, saying they had “stolen my childhood” with their “empty words”.

She told leaders they would never be forgiven if they failed to tackle rising temperatures.

""People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing, we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and the fairy tale of endless economic growth. How dare you?"" she asked.

The teenager said emissions should be cut to keep temperature rises to 1.5C, beyond which scientists have warned the impacts of climate change become much more severe.

And she warned that the situation could not be solved by ""business as usual"" and some technological solutions.

President Trump, who has shown his sceptism for Greta's views, seemed unamused by the speech, leaving just 15 minutes after arriving.

What inspired Greta to become a climate change campaigner?

Greta first heard about climate change when she was 8 years old.

This interest developed and at age 15, she won a climate change essay competition in a local newspaper.

Still, Greta felt not enough was being done to improve the climate.

In 2018, she decided to take action and compelled global leaders to make a change.

When she was named the Time's person of the year in 2019, she told the publication,""We can’t just continue living as if there was no tomorrow, because there is a tomorrow.”

Arnold Schwarzenegger Breaks Down Climate Change – And He 'Doesn't Give a F---' If You Agree with Him

In a lengthy post titled “I don’t give a f*** if we agree about climate change,” the former governor of California confronted Facebook users who have questioned his “crusade for a clean energy future” by posing three questions of his own.

“First – do you believe it is acceptable that 7 million people die every year from pollution?” he asked in his post on Monday. “That’s more than murders, suicides, and car accidents – combined.”

“My second question: do you believe coal and oil will be the fuels of the future?”

And then, breaking it down into terms so simple that even his iconic robot character from The Terminator could grasp them, Schwarzenegger asked his final question:

“There are two doors. Behind Door Number One is a completely sealed room, with a regular, gasoline-fueled car. Behind Door Number Two is an identical, completely sealed room, with an electric car I’m guessing you chose the Door Number Two, with the electric car, right? Door number one is a fatal choice – who would ever want to breathe those fumes? This is the choice the world is making right now.”

“To use one of the four-letter words all of you commenters love, I don’t give a damn if you believe in climate change,” he concluded. “I couldn’t care less if you’re concerned about temperatures rising or melting glaciers. It doesn’t matter to me which of us is right about the science. I just hope that you’ll join me in opening Door Number Two, to a smarter, cleaner, healthier, more profitable energy future.”

Schwarzenegger also called on politicians to take action on global warming when he attended the COP21 climate summit in Paris.

“It’s not 20 years from now. Right now, seven million people are dying every year,” he told the BBC. “Nineteen thousand a day … that is alarming. And everyone in government has a responsibility to protect the people … they have to do something about it.”

The actor-turned-politician-turned-actor isn’t the only star lending his voice to the climate change cause. Leonardo DiCaprio, who has been appointed U.N. Messenger of Peace for the Climate, was also on hand for the climate summit, where he discussed solutions to prevent global warming with Secretary of State John Kerry and other top officials.

The MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) project is expected to cost about €130m (£120m/$150m).

Its scale means it must be an international effort. RV Polarstern will be supported by icebreakers from Russia, Sweden and China.

The wife of Phinehas, passing through the swirling waters of the river of death, said: ""The glory is departed from Israel ""Thoughtfully scanning the pages of history, rubbing the dust of centuries off the tombs of some nations that underwent the frightful processes of self-burial, we can give the same testimonies concerning other nations. For 'tis true that, warmed by the sun which never loses its glory, a nation's sun may set in night. Under the stars - stars which never lose their splendor a nation's starry crown may lose its brightness, being displaced by a withered wreath of poison ivy or a circle of undesirable cactus, or by the brow becoming an eyeless, earless, tongueless, brainless skull.

Beneath the heavens which declare the glory of God, even as the firmament showeth His handiwork, a nation that circled the clouds as a strong-winged eagle, can flutter among the clouds as a broken- winged vulture or squawking parrot. Among the flowery continents of God a nation can become a place of foul odours that make the righteous stop their noses.

[Ancient Babylon] Great was the glory of Babylon of old; but Babylon became a vermin-infested, animal-prowling jungle - Babylon, ""the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency,"" became ""as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah."" Something of the tragic departure of its glory is told in these words:

""It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall he full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.""- Isaiah 13:20-22.

[Ancient Carthage] Great was the glory of Carthage centuries ago. But her commanders became as impotent as skeletons of cattle scattered on desert sands. Her swift feet became as a cripple's walk - her clenched fist as the fumbling fingers of a paralytic.

[Ancient Syria] Wondrous the glory of Syria at a time when Eleanor's troubadours at Antioch bewitched the Syrian air with ballads of the South - and lightened the horrors of the second crusade. But Syria's glory departed when the following was said. ""But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; They are revolted and gone.""- Jeremiah 5:23.

[Ancient Greece] Great was the glory of ancient Greece - especially from 450 B.C. to 350 B.C. - under Pericles. But Greece became a moulded crust in history's garbage heap. Greece had her Athens -- civilization's queen. Plato was hers. Socrates was hers. A vast multitude of seers was hers. Phidias, raising beautiful children unto Athens from the sterile womb of stone, marbled many places with sculptured wonders. The Muses tented in her gates and plumed the arts with eagle's wings. At many shrines the human brain bowed in reverence. But with all these persons, with all these things of beauty, Greece became a moulded crust in history's garbage can.

[Ancient Rome] Great the glory of the Rome of centuries far back and forever gone - especially from 50 B.C. to 60 A.D. - with her astute statesmen, with her close-meshed code of laws, with her sword-woven mantle, coin- embroidered, that fell on cities where merchants congregated and fattened on the spoils of trade, with her armies that feasted and fattened on blood.

Rome was mighty among the kingdoms - mighty wherever ships and swords and thrones and lust of gold and sovereignty constituted the boasted heritage of the age. But Rome and her glory became as a mouth full of pyorrheic gums holding rotten teeth, all loose and foul.

[Ancient Nineveh] Great the glory of the nation-like realm of Nineveh - with her winged lions symbolic of strength and speed. But Nineveh became as a vari-colored butterfly enmeshed and perishing in the net of a relentless spider.

[Ancient Egypt] Great the glory of old ancient Egypt - the land of the Pharaohs -the land of wealth and wonders. But it became a shabby sexton of splendid tombs - her torch of far-reaching splendor became a pot of smoke without one spark of remaining radiance.

[Ancient Spain] Great was the glory of ancient Spain - back there in the glorious years beyond recall. Wide and strong was the sway of her scepter. Her piratical ships harassed all the seas and filled her coffers with gold. But this nation, with climate and conquests and caches of coin, with thrones and crowns and scepters, with laughter and love and lure, with men and money and might, with fervor and force and fruit, became as a drowsy and lousy and frowsy beggar watching a broken clock.

[Ancient Jerusalem] And let us ask you to think of Jerusalem - ""beautiful for situation ""- as representative of the nation Israel. Triumphant were her temples. Her past ""shines glorious as doth the moon on midnight seas."" For favoured Jerusalem, kings kneeled down and prayed. For glorious Jerusalem, prophets, in tears and love, served. For beautiful Jerusalem, martyrs shriveled into flame. In Jerusalem's virgin face were eyes in which, deep-folded, lay prophecies of the Son of God.

But because within her sacred courts evil was girt with diadem, Jerusalem hardened her heart. Jerusalem bloodied her hands. Jerusalem deafened her ears. Jerusalem played the harlot. And Jesus described her then departing and afterward utterly departed glory in these words, ""Thy house is left unto thee desolate.""

Covered this blood-soaked earth with the wreck of once-glorious cities. Scarred the face of this war-blighted earth with the ruin of once-glorious nations. Marred the fair face of this world with the wreck of once-glorious civilizations - civilizations which have left behind them nothing but the smoke of the brilliant torch, nothing more than an empty name, nothing more than the shadow of a shadow.

What the Bible says about some nations and some cities - representatives in large measure of once- proud, once-strong, once-influential civilizations - is true of other nations and cities of the past and the present:

""For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, That Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes...

""Also Edom shall be a desolation. every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof...

""And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever; there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it. ""- Jeremiah 49:13,17,33.

""This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, That said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one That passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.""- Zephaniah 2:15.

In America we must remember that the glory of a nation is righteousness and faith in God - and going the way God points - and in such is our security against all foes, our immunity against the ravages of time.

""For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish, yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.""- Isaiah 60:12. This sober truth that only righteousness exalteth a nation -- that if ever America loses her faith in God she will have to come off her pedestal, that pallbearers that carried other nations to their graves will do work for us if we forsake God and refuse to go the way He points -- was put upon our hearts once by the editor of the Watchman-Examiner in these words:

""We should remember that one hundred years ago Germany was regarded as the most Christian nation in Europe. Germany's evangelicalism was once so pronounced that Martin Luther gave us the marvelous translation of the Scriptures and directed the world to the Bible. The Scriptures so influenced the Home, the School, and the Church of Germany that the national life saw a phenomenal progress. Germany was now making terrific strides in science, art, and culture. Then came a day when innate conceit got to work. Christianity was emasculated. Christ was rationalized to be nothing more than a good man. The Holy Scriptures were reduced to a crazy quilt. Religion came to be built on negatives. God was dwarfed and man was deified. 'Let the strong survive,' became the new religion. Germany was decivilized and Hitler had no trouble getting his followers to arm to the hilt to conquer the world.""

Let us ask the help of Almighty God in these days when men ""loose wild tongues that hold not God in awe,"" when there are evils that would lead our greatest graces to the grave and leave the world no copy. When the atheistic deformities of our times would coerce us into substituting for Christianity's vital bread a chunk of froth scattered by miasmatic winds - lest our country become a despised Ichabod among the nations of earth.

A Church May Lose Her Glory

""Thy glory hath departed ""Too bad and too sad when that is spoken of a church about which glorious things once were spoken. 'Tis tragic, 'tis true that of some churches such is the epitaphic description of their decay, their inverted torch, their oil-less lamps, their turning back in the day of battle - though armed and carrying bows. That is grief for angels. That is laughter for devils. That is gloating for Satan. That is groaning for Christ's followers.

A church can ""leave its first love ""The church at Ephesus did - and needed to ""repent and do the first works ""Revelation 2:4,5. A church can change from an army into an ecclesiastical nursery wherein the preacher is looked upon as a head nurse who has more to do with milk bottles for sickly saints than with mighty battles against seductive Satan. Then does its glory depart.

A church can change from a church of compassionate concern into a church of callisthenic conventionality utterly devoid of devotional vitality - censorious of spiritual and far-sighted leadership, worldly, wayward, and peevishly puny. Then can Ichabod be written over its portals, its pews, its pulpit.

A church can change from a cataract of activity into a scum-covered pond of stagnation.

Thus, forgetting that ""she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth,"" she hastens the departure of her glory.

A church can change from a church of aggressive conquest into a church possessive of a slothful timidity, a passive acquiescence in small attainments, a criminal spineless in the face of evils that arrogantly challenge, a careless in- difference to great stretches of the unattained.

Thus is Ichabod an appropriate adjective for its activities and aimlessness. A church can be a roller of marbles when it should be a remover of mountains. Thus does its spiritual muscle become flabby, its fingers fumbling, its feet halt - as the glory departs.

A church can put its headlight on the rear and think only of the glory that was. Then and thus does its light grow dim, its voice faltering, its spiritual ambitions anemic, its worship boresomely lacking in life, its glory one of the past. Pathetic the words that fell from the Master's lips. ""And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!

And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down"" Mark 13:1,2. They were great buildings. They were magnificent stones. But to his eyes they were nothing more than ruins, for the glory of the temple's worship and service had departed.

""But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart""- I Sam. 16:7.

Outwardly that beautiful and stately temple seemed destined to ""defy the tooth of time."" Inwardly it was hollow and empty and tottering to its fall. Write ""Ichabod"" upon it.

Is it possible for a church, when God calls it to ""launch out into the deep ""in the matter of soul-winning, to become ""a drifting sepulcher manned by a frozen crew?""

Well, when academic luster takes the place of spiritual passion, when refrigeration is valued above conflagration, such is the danger.

I once heard Dr. Perry Webb say: ""The atmosphere in some churches is so cold, you can skate down the aisles.""

Is it true that a church may be noted for the gorgeous architecture of its building, the lovely music of its choir, the stateliness of its ritual, the fine-functioning of all its organizations, the largeness of numbers as to its congregation, the influence in many circles of business and social and educational life - and yet be, in the eyes of Him who marks the sparrow's fall, as a corpse wrapped in an ornate shroud?

Of the church at Sardis, Jesus, risen and enthroned, said: ""And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write, These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.""- Revelation 3:1.

Somebody described another church like unto the church at Sardis in these words:

Outwardly splendid as of old -

Inwardly sparkless, void and cold - 

Her force and fire all spent and gone - 

Like the dead moon she still shines on.

R.T. Ketcham once said: 

""Attend church, but do not attend a church which prefers science to Scripture, reason for revelation, theories for truth, culture for conversion, benevolence for blood, goodness for grace, sociability for spirituality, play for praise, pep for prayer, profession for possession, progress for power, reformation for regeneration, good for God, speculation for salvation, jubilation for justification, feelings for faith, paralysis for peace, politics for precepts.""

To this I make additional comment saying that a church deserves to have Ichabod written from its lowest cellar step to the sky-touching point of its steeple which prefers the adulation of saints to ardent anxieties concerning lost sinners as well as abhorrence of that which is evil.

Glory yields up its scepter - when the fancies of literary notables have place along with the facts of the gospel, when there is the frivolity of the flesh instead of the fervor of the spiritual in serving the Lord - godliness in form only instead of glorying in the cross of Christ - a groping after eternal verities - and a guessing that only borders on godliness as to the certainties of God's promises instead of a guidance of others into paths of righteousness.

Glory ""packs its baggage for a one-way trip"" when in the church people are noted for faultfinding instead of being notable for forgiveness - when offense is quickly taken and there is overlordism instead of the offering of self for lowly service - when the making of money means more than the mastery of money.

How can the glory of the church be as a sunlit mountain whose position never changes when in the church there is playing at the job and little praying on the job - when peevishness and petulance predominate over praise - when there is quarrelsomeness instead of quietness - when there is frequent rumpus-raising and riotous revelry instead of restfulness, sinfulness instead of saintliness, selfishness instead of service, tattling instead of testimony, tampering with temptation instead of triumph over temptation.

""Thy glory hath departed ""will be written on earth and known in Heaven of the church where there is more yawning over watches than yearning over wanderers-where there is mere zest and not zealousness in good works. Let us so live and give, so love and serve, so watch and pray, that, if the individual's conduct were universalized, it would never be as a hand that writes of a church, ""Thy glory hath departed.""

The true glory of a church consists: ""in the purity of its members; in its spiritual progress; in the unity of its fellowship; in the spiritual children born into its household of faith; in its self-sacrificing spirit toward others; and in the prayer life of the whole group. When a church is in a healthy condition hypocrisy will be limited; progress in purity will be constant; strife and discord will disappear; sympathy for the lost will seek means for their rescue; recruits will outnumber the losses from backsliding, removal, and death; private devotion will be a pleasure, family religion a joy, and public worship a sought delight.""

Along with this let us remember that any church will undergo the frightful processes of dishonorable self- burial where there is a lax theology that advocates a mutilated Bible, a minimized sin, a deified man, a humanized Christ-substituting human opinions and speculations for the revealed pronouncements of God concerning the Bible, concerning the nature of men, concerning the terrors of sin, concerning the deity of Christ, concerning the meaning of Christ's death on the cross, concerning the plan of salvation, concerning Hell, concerning Heaven.

A Home May Lose Its Glory

Yet, glorious as the glory of a real home is, the glory can depart - sometimes does depart - assuredly will depart - if the things ""down under"" Christian ideals, sordidly below Christian standards for a home - get the upper hand and put their oppressive heels upon the virtues which would weave wedding garments instead of shrouds on the home loom.

Answer these questions: Are there not many homes that are polluted reservoirs from which muddy streams that carry deadly contamination flow? Are there not many homes that are grindstones on which the Devil sharpens his weapons of wickedness?

The glory of a home departs when parents walk on the edges of mental abysses - talking nonsense. The glory of a home will assuredly leave a home as a flower wilts under heavy frost - when parents, by neglect or omission in spiritual matters, send children out to sea in paper boats, as though seas did not drown, - when parents, in matters momentous as to issue in stainlessness of morals, permit children, in daring defiance of Christian conduct, to walk bare-footed on live coals, as though fire did not burn.

Today so many homes die in houses. Today many who know better, living for things that matter least, neglecting things that matter most, are content with houses in which there are no homes.

In pioneer days, wolves often attacked children. In remote mountain districts eagles did the same. Out West Indians attempted to destroy the home of settlers. On battlefields vultures have eaten the sons of women. Now vultures of evil literature attack our children. Now poisonous serpents are in every pathway they tread. Now the jackals of sex familiarity are fed by precept and example. Now the leaping leopards of lust; Now the vultures of infidelity in ministry and press; Now barnyard morality; Now demagogues who ravage the land; Now the buzzards of liquor traffic on every corner - permitted there by the United States Government; Now the theory of evolution in most schools - evolution, the antithesis of Christianity; Now modernism choosing the livery of Heaven to serve the Devil in; Now godless scholarship summoning the Bible to appear at the bar of human reason; Now all these infest our land.

All of which is to say that - no explorer amid the wilds of the North, no adventurer amid unexplored jungles, no doctor amid deadly contagions of disease - ever had to face as many dangers as our children of today face: their morals, their spiritual welfare, their mental wealth, their soul's salvation considered.

Parental delinquency makes glory depart from a home. Are we unfair to say that behind every delinquent child is a delinquent parent? Are we ceasing to tell the truth when we say that behind every broken youth is a broken home? Do we not speak words of truth when we say that behind every broken home is a neglect of God in that home?

When a fifteen-year-old unmarried girl, pregnant with child, stands before the court and states that she does not consider she has done wrong - no more than thousands of other young girls are doing - where are the mothers?

When a fourteen-year-old boy, apprehended for roaming the streets of a city at early morning hours, stands before the court with tears in his eyes and asks to be sent to the state school - because he knows he would be happier there than in his own home - where is the father?

When young girls smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and dress so skimpily they attract the attention of every goggle-eyed man and boy - do not their mothers the same?

When boys argue over the relative ""values"" and ""quick-stirring"" powers of advertised brands of liquor - do not their fathers drink booze and vote for legalizing it, forgetting that you can control a powder can in a fire as easily as you can control booze?

Is there not too much laxness on the part of parents toward spiritual values? Often children are allowed to stay out of Sunday School and to miss church services - to remain in almost complete ignorance of the spiritual values. Is it not perilous to children, this easy-come, easy-go attitude of parents? Is not the use of intoxicating beverages one of the greatest evils responsible for juvenile delinquency?

Are not children from homes where indiscriminate drinking is done sent out to ""play the game"" with two strikes against them? Do not thinking people believe that youth delinquency would be negligible if it were not for delinquent adults, especially delinquent parents? Can one pass judgment on these young people without indictment of ourselves for failure somewhere down the line?

Do not boys and girls get into trouble when too much leisure time is theirs?

Are not city governments extremely unwise to say they have no money for further improvement of playgrounds while they allot large sums of taxpayers' money for the cost of punishing the youth for committing crimes?

Is it not shortsightedness bordering on imbecility to pay so much for the cost of juvenile delinquency and so little for its prevention?

""Any law should be so framed to penalize the delinquent parent as well as the delinquent child . . . We must first give God his rightful place in the American home ... Until the cardinal principles of God are implanted in the hearts of the youth of our nation...until there is instilled in the hearts of the parents of these youth a God-like sense of responsibility in that home, we shall continue to experience wave upon wave of crime, mounting and growing steadily day by day, until it reaches a magnitude beyond the scope of the law-enforcement agencies and the American people to control.""

But if parents distinguish themselves by the profession of truth, the worship of God, the practice of virtue, they will be sure to draw others after them; whereas if they are irreligious and un-Christian, they are infested fountains that poison. Parents can no more dispense with personal piety without malicious influence on children than a tree can dispense with sap and bear fruit.

Adam and Eve sinned! And Cain became a murderer. Had they not sinned, Abel would have lived. If a rock is a quotation from the quarry, if a flower is a quotation from the garden, if a tree is a quotation from the forest, if a bird is a quotation from the flock, if every child is a quotation of his parents - what sort do the children make you?

Today the situation is desperate. Character is at a premium in the land. Criminality of all kinds is rampant. The daily prints are filled with record of deeds almost too revolting for public consumption.

An ever-rising wave of lawlessness is hurling its weight against the bulwarks of the nation. Much of this is because of godless homes-because too many fathers and mothers have abdicated.

How parents ought to rejoice for the opportunity of living close to God, of hearing the motion of angel's wings in the patter of little children, and of being Christlike in the home.

Glory in a home is made secure when Christian conduct is evident. Unless you serve God yourselves as parents you will plant vines on which will grow grapes of bitterness. ""What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? ""Ezekiel 18:2

Nothing is so infectious as example: ""We can do more good by being good than in any other way ""(Kingsley). ""A father who whipped his son for swearing and swore while he whipped him, did more harm by his example than good by his correction ""(Fuller). ""Noble examples stir us up to noble actions""(Burke). ""Live with wolves and you will learn to howl.""

A drinking or drunken father is a poor preacher of sobriety to sons. A proud father is a miserable recommender of humility to sons. They will do as you do rather than as you say. Your example will counteract all the effect of your counsel - and all the convictions you would fix in the mind will fall like arrows from an impenetrable shield. You should therefore begin ""both to do and to teach.""

You should be able, in a humble measure, at least, to say to those under your care: ""Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ..."" ""Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?"" Romans 2:21-23

If parents suffered their children to go naked, to beg their bread, to lie unattended in sickness, to perish with hunger in a ditch, they would be shunned as monsters. But parents act a far more criminal and a far more infamous part by disregarding their spiritual and everlasting welfare.

Doubtless Herod, after killing the infants in Bethlehem, was viewed and shunned with horror. But he was far less cruel than some modern parents. He only destroyed the body.

""But it any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, be hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. ""I Timothy 5:8.

Let us remember and teach others to remember - lest glory depart from our dwellings - that there is a difference in a house and a home: that a house is built by human hands but a home is built by human hearts, that a house is built of visible materials but a home is built of the invisible things of the Spirit; that a house may be destroyed, but fire and flood and earthquake and storm can not destroy a real home; that there is only one calamity can ruin a home, the death of love; that the real food of a home is not meat and bread but thoughtfulness and unselfishness.

The basis for Christianity in the home, the preventative of departed glory, is Jesus and the church.

Can there be a real Christian home without union with the church?

Can there be Christian homes without churchgoing as a habit as well as a duty and a privilege?

Jesus had the habit of churchgoing, for 'tis written: ""He was in the synagogue as was his custom on the Sabbath day.""

When I was a boy it was as natural to go to church on Sunday as it was to work on Monday or to play games on Saturday afternoon, but the present idea is that it is a terrible thing, a species of mental and physical punishment.

Dr. Macartney tells how when Grover Cleveland lay dying at Princeton, his mind reverted, not to any of the fierce political battles through which he had passed, nor to the presidential honors and burdens which he had borne, but to the old home in the Presbyterian manse, where his minister father at family worship prayed for the eternal salvation of his children.

The dying man asked that a copy of the hymnbook out of which they used to sing be procured, so that with its music and its memories he might face the eternal world. And then this great preacher says:

""All kinds of doctors are abroad today with all kinds of remedies for our national and social diseases. But a filled family pew in God's house on the Lord's day is the best thing that can ever happen to a family, a city, or a nation.""

An Individual May Lose the Glory

It is possible for an individual so to live that it can be said in earth and declared in Heaven: ""Thy glory has departed ""- as light departs from a lamp in which there is no oil, as fruitfulness departs from a tree wherein is no sap.

The old poet must have had some experience of this truth when he wrote:

I remember, I remember, 

But now 'tis little joy 

To know I'm farther off from Heaven 

Than when I was a boy.

What tragedy when ""Ichabod""- ""Thy glory hath departed ""- is written above and over a once- believing heart! What sorrow sufficient to make angels weep - when ""thy-glory-hath-departed ""is the autobiography of a life once faithful, once loyal, once devoted. What cause for grief when the life once a life of unselfish service becomes a life of stagnant selfishness - a life that centers in self. What tragedy for earth and man and God when the life once possessed of the fruit of the Spirit - ""love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, meekness, goodness, faith, self-control ""- is now a life in which is manifest the works of the flesh - ""adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envying, murders, drunkenness, reveling, and such like.""

Yet that you see, that you find, in the lives of some individuals who have gone from us - and in the lives of some who now live in our midst. So many who call themselves Christians have lost the old-time glow. With them the sacred fervor of other years is lacking.

Men and women there are who once believed in prayer and believed that we forfeit peace and bear needless pain because we do not carry everything to God in prayer; but now they are prayerless altogether or are weak in prayer and look upon it as a useless exercise.

People I know who, when they were young, believed the Bible to be the Word of God - infinite in scope, infallible in authority, regenerative in power, personal in application - who now say that it is a book of myths and allegories. Of them 'tis tragically true they have hewn themselves cisterns where no water is and have forsaken the fountain of living waters.

I know young people who have attended schools that once, in the days of our forefathers, were bulwarks for the most holy faith. Entering these schools they were believers in the miraculous and the supernatural, but now, deceived by the evil seducers who wooed and won them with strange and fantastic myths, they are adrift - without chart or compass.

From them the glory hath departed, even as it had departed from schools which serve the Devil in the livery of Heaven. Instead of believing the certainties of God's Word, they put their trust in the unscriptural surmises of men. Instead of feeding on God's Word, they have grown lean on the diet of quips given them by those who, calling themselves scholarly teachers, plant ""probabilities ""and ""perhapses"" and ""maybes"" or ""not-at-alls"" in the minds of youth.

Thus has glory departed from the teachers and from the taught. Thus has glory departed from the schools in which these teachers teach. The students so taught and the teachers who, like vandals, break into the house of their faith should realize that man's wisdom is to be laughed at.

How glory departs from an individual, or a multitude of individuals when they depart from the teaching of the supernaturalistic school, championed by orthodox Christians contending that Christ is the God-man - to line up with the materialistic school, championed by evolutionists.

Think of Judas - the incarnation of infamy today! Shakespeare called him ""the base Judean who sold a pearl richer than all his tribe."" Judas, given a great opportunity by Christ Himself, had part of ""the ministry and apostleship on which angels longed to serve."" Did not this position place its participant on a level with Moses and Elijah?

But the glory of this individual began to grow dim when he began to wonder about the course that Jesus chose in refusing the kingship and in antagonizing the rulers. The glory grew even dimmer when he began to worry about the future - and dimmer still when he began to pilfer the bag. And his glory departed completely when he went out into the night to bargain to betray Jesus for the price of a hog! Truly over it all you can write: ""Thy glory hath departed.""

And think of Lot - called just and righteous. ""And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day, with their unlawful deeds.) ""He was driven to Egypt when famine came, yet his soul in many ways became a famished soul. A businessman, an opportunist, maker of a bad choice that he thought was a good choice. He certainly added no brightness to manhood's torch by marrying a woman of Sodom - the wickedest city mentioned in man's literature, hopelessly corrupt. Lot escaped with only his family when God burned Sodom to the ground. Lot's last act was one of incest. From his daughters came the nations of Ammon and Moab.

And think of Saul - first king of Israel. His glory, which was as a burning bush of splendor, faded into lusterless cold ashes. Let us see what the Scriptures tell us: ""And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons. And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. Then said Saul unto his Armour bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me. But his Armour bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it ""I Samuel 31:2-4.

Again and again, with tragic repetition, do the pages of history testify that individuals who once gave light as steady stars came to the time and place where their light was the flame of a fluttering candle. In our churches we see people who once served faithfully who proved their kinship with Demas - to the hurt of some and to the sorrow of many. In some homes we have those who once held as sacred the marital vow who have gone as wild as the winds which know no barriers in making these vows perjury. 'Tis true that many know not, or, if knowing, give no heed to the truth that to leave Jesus out of life is to say good-by to glory. Against all things and against all evils that bring people to the place and time where they say good-by to glory,

I would that all men would take an unwavering stand remembering God's promise:

""And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee."" Jeremiah 1:19

187,"In recent years, climate change has loomed like a dark specter over the globe, contributing to everything from gentrification in Miami to refugees fleeing drought and crop shortages in Guatemala. But the urgency around the issue reached new heights in 2018 when the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated that rapid, ""far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"" would be needed in order to drop carbon dioxide levels by 2030 and prevent catastrophic global warming.

Scientists have indeed proposed drastic measures — just not in the way that you might think. In the same IPCC report, the U.N. suggests that adding 2.5 billion acres (1 billion hectares) of forest to the world could limit global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) by 2050. In other words: Responding to climate change will require planting new trees. A lot of them.

And now, the U.N. might just have the data to back up their proposal.

In a recent study, unveiled July 5, 2019 in the journal Science, a group of researchers associated with the Crowther Lab in Switzerland found that global tree restoration to the tune of 223 million acres (900 million hectares) of canopy cover — an area that's approximately the size of the U.S. — is ""our most effective climate change solution to date."" These trees would store 205 billion tons (186 metric tons) of carbon, or roughly two thirds of the carbon that has been emitted ""as a result of human activity since the Industrial Revolution,"" according to a press release. Although some news reports have said this much forest restoration is the equivalent of roughly 1 trillion trees, this statistic is actually linked to an estimate from an older 2015 study.

Jean-François Bastin, the Crowther Lab's study lead author, breaks down their 2019 analysis by email. ""The idea was to estimate what tree cover could be expected when you removed the 'human factor,' i.e. what specific types of forest would naturally occur in the absence of other development, and where,"" he says. Bastin and his team used a form of artificial intelligence known as ""machine learning"" to build ""a model to link tree cover with climate/soil/topography, based on 78,000 observations of tree cover in protected areas.""

The researchers then projected the data further to estimate the ""total potential tree cover of the planet,"" Bastin explains. Afterward, the team excluded land currently being used for urban settlements, croplands and existing forests, which yielded the total amount of land available for restoration. The study includes a map showing how much tree coverage different parts of the globe can support; the top three areas include Russia, Canada and the U.S.

In many ways, the study's timing couldn't be more perfect, as it aligns with current global efforts around ecological restoration. One example is the Trillion Trees Vision, which seeks to restore 1 trillion trees by 2050. Another is the Bonn Challenge, which is a partnership between the government of Germany and the U.N.'s International Union for Conservation of Nature that aims to restore 371 million acres (150 million hectares) of deforested land by 2020.

You might be thinking, well, that sounds pretty easy. Let's all roll up our sleeves and save the planet by planting one tree at a time — right? But some experts say the situation is actually a little more complicated than that rosy picture. Especially if most nations don't chip in to help.

""Implementation of forest restoration on the scale discussed in this paper is not as straightforward as it might seem,"" says Jim Hallett, chair of the board of directors for the Society for Ecological Restoration. ""By 2018, there were commitments of over 420 million acres (170 million hectares) by 58 nations, which exceeds the Bonn Challenge goal. Current estimates indicate that around 29 percent of the committed lands are now under restoration, but most of this work has been done by a few countries.""

Hallett cites major challenges to implementing restoration on such a global scale, ""including financing, governance, land tenure and ownership, [and] capacity to do the work."" Hallett concludes, ""there is ample evidence that, in some contexts, if the benefits of restoration are not equally shared, the project will fail. So incentive programs have to be carefully developed.""

Although Hallett agrees that forest restoration is important to addressing climate change, restoration alone will likely not be enough. It takes time, after all, to implement such big restoration projects and also for these trees to store carbon. And Hallett stresses that ""the possibility of future restoration should not be used as an excuse for degrading intact lands.""

Other scientists question not only the practicality of the study's claims, but also the study's very methodology. ""Many of the allegedly available restoration areas are clearly unsuitable for more trees than they currently support. If you look closely at the map, a large proportion of these areas are in regions where soils are permanently frozen,"" says Eike Luedeling, a climate change researcher and professor of horticultural sciences at the University of Bonn.

Luedeling continues, ""The methodology implicitly (probably not on purpose) implies that carbon stock is proportional to canopy cover, i.e. ecosystems without trees contain no carbon. This is clearly false and strongly inflates the global estimate [of restoration].""

Jan Börner, Luedeling's colleague and a professor for economics of sustainable land use at the University of Bonn, is similarly skeptical. Börner says that some areas being proposed for restoration under the current study are already in use for other purposes. Börner considers the study to be an ""interesting academic exercise ... but as a [climate change] mitigation strategy proposal (and it is being advertised as such!), it sends a misleading signal to the international climate policy debate.""

But don't fret just yet. Both Bastin and Hallett emphasize that the U.N. has declared 2021 to 2030 the ""Decade on Ecosystem Restoration,"" which could spur nations to act quickly — and some countries are already tackling the initiative head on. And, according to Hallett, forest restoration boasts far more perks than just impacting climate change, including maintaining — or even increasing — biodiversity and preserving the ecosystem that we humans rely upon for our food and water.

But even the study's authors acknowledge that it's going to take a lot of goodwill to make this grand vision a reality.

""What we need is universal action: international agencies, NGOs, governments, all citizens — anyone can be involved,"" says Bastian. ""Local communities and small organizations may be especially effective. While they do not have the same reach as national agencies, they have the benefit of knowing what works best in their own backyards.""

424,"Climate change is putting people at greater risk from deadly carcinogens while threatening their access to cancer treatment, according to a new study by public health experts.

Extreme weather events like hurricanes and wildfires are increasing in intensity and frequency due to climate change and in turn, release carcinogens into the atmosphere.

Hurricane Harvey battered Louisiana and Texas in 2017 with devastating impacts felt along the Gulf Coast and in the city of Houston. The category-4 storm inundated chemical plants, oil refineries, and Superfund sites that contained vast amounts of carcinogens that were released into the Houston community, the researchers found.

In 2018, an investigation by the Associated Press and Houston Chronicle found more than 100 toxic releases into surrounding communities related to Hurricane Harvey, on land, in water and in the air.

The increase of patients' exposure to carcinogens was compounded by the fact that the hurricane conditions made it difficult for patients to seek preventative care and treatment while also threatening the lab and clinical infrastructure that supports cancer care.

The study was published today in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians by researchers from the American Cancer Society and Harvard University. Cancer is the second-leading cause of death for Americans.

Wildfires are another risk. Global warming has led to longer wildfire seasons in the US that have spread over greater areas. Widespread burning releases vast amounts of air pollutants that are known to cause cancer, the study notes.

Lung cancer is associated with long-term exposure to particle pollution and wood-fire smoke but few studies have been conducted. It’s unclear how short-term exposure to such smoke will affect people, AP reported.​

Tackling climate change will have both environmental and health benefits. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will not only be good for the planet but will reduce air pollutants emitted from combustion processes that are harmful to health, the study noted.

Another proposal for tackling cancer is diet. The Mayo Clinic estimates that around a third of cancer cases could be prevented by switching from animal sources to a plant-based diet.

The agricultural sector is the source of one-third of greenhouse gas emissions with cattle as the main agricultural source of greenhouse gases worldwide, according to UC Davis.

The authors of the new study wrote: ""While some may view these issues as beyond the scope of responsibility of the nation's cancer treatment facilities, one need look no further than their mission statements, all of which speak to eradicating cancer.

""Climate change and continued reliance on fossil fuels push that noble goal further from reach.

""However, if all those whose life work is to care for those with cancer made clear to the communities they serve that actions to combat climate change and lessen our use of fossil fuels could prevent cancers and improve cancer outcomes, we might see actions that address climate change flourish, and the attainment of our missions to reduce suffering from cancer grow nearer.""​",mainstream
1258,"While researching a feature for TIME.com recently, I had the chance to sift through TIME's decades of environment coverage. I came to two conclusions: First, we were writing stories about virtually the same subjects 40 years ago as we do now. (Air pollution, endangered species, the polluted oceans, dwindling natural resources.) Second, our coverage of climate change has been really scary  by which I mean, we've emphasized the catastrophic threats of global warming in dire language. That reached a height in 2006, when we titled our cover story on climate change, crowned with a photo of a lonely polar bear on an ice floe, ""Be Worried. Be Very Worried."" And since it was published, I've seen that cover image pop up in countless PowerPoint presentations on climate change, always used to underscore just how catastrophic warming would be.

I was part of the team that put that issue together, and I know why we used the language we did. Scientists were telling us that global warming really had the potential to wreck the future of the planet, and we wanted to get that message across to readers  even if it meant scaring the hell out of them.

But if a new study is to be believed, we might have been making the situation worse, not better. According to forthcoming research by the Berkeley psychologists Robb Willer and Matthew Feinberg, when people are shown scientific evidence or news stories on climate change that emphasize the most negative aspects of warming  extinguished species, melting ice caps, serial natural disasters  they are actually more likely to dismiss or deny what they're seeing. Far from scaring people into taking action on climate change, such messages seem to scare them straight into denial.

Here's how the study worked. Willer and Feinberg tested participants' belief in global warming, and then their belief in what's called the just-world theory, which holds that life is generally fair and predictable. The subjects were then randomly assigned to read one of two newspaper-style articles. Both pieces were identical through the first four paragraphs, providing basic scientific information about climate change, but they differed in their conclusions, with one article detailing the possibly apocalyptic consequences of climate change, and the other ending with a more upbeat message about potential solutions to global warming.

Willer and Feinberg found that participants given the doomsday articles came out more skeptical of climate change, while those who read the bright-side pieces came out less skeptical. The increase in skepticism was especially acute among subjects who'd scored high on the just-world scale, perhaps because the worst victims of global warming  the poor of the developing world, future generations, blameless polar bears  are the ones least responsible for it. Such unjust things couldn't possibly occur, and so the predictions can't be true. The results, Willer and Feinberg wrote, ""demonstrate how dire messages warning of the severity of global warming and its presumed dangers can backfire ... by contradicting individuals' deeply held beliefs that the world is fundamentally just.""

Now a climate scientist armed with data might argue that worldviews should be trumped by facts. But there's no denying that climate skepticism is on the rise: a new report from the Pew Research Center found that the percentage of Americans who believe there is solid evidence that the earth is warming because of human activity has fallen from 50% in 2006 to 34%. The numbers are even lower for conservatives  just 16% of Republicans surveyed believe in manmade global warming, compared with 53% of Democrats.

Poor messaging isn't the only possible cause for the increase in denial: politicians  mostly on the right  have aggressively pushed the climate-change-is-a-hoax trope. The Climategate controversy of a year ago certainly might have played a role, too, though the steady decline in belief began well before those hacked e-mails were published. Still, the fact remains that if the point of the frightening images in global-warming documentaries like An Inconvenient Truth was to push audiences to act on climate change, they've been a failure theoretically and practically.

Some environmental advocates want to double down on the current communication strategy. A group of prominent climate scientists published a letter in Science this week arguing for an initiative that will ""actively and effectively share information about climate-change risk and potential solutions with the public."" It's good to have scientists out and engaged with the public; but if the messaging doesn't change, neither will the results. What may be needed instead is what the science-media expert Matthew Nisbet calls a ""postpartisan plan"" for climate-change communication, one that ratchets down the catastrophe and focuses on the immediate benefits that energy action can have for Americans.

For many environmentalists, convinced that we truly are facing an existential threat, that might seem like surrender. The writer and activist Bill McKibben has a saying: ""You can't negotiate with the planet."" That's true  but you have to negotiate with the public. Scaring them out of their wits will produce little beyond fear. Increasingly, the war over climate change won't just be fought in scientific journals and international summits, but also between our ears.

680,"Sweeping down a perfectly groomed piste, with fresh air in your lungs, mountain vistas all around can feel like the most wholesome, natural pursuit. But behind this pure thrill loom copious environmental concerns. From flattening trees to create runs, to energy-guzzling infrastructure, snow sports stand accused of destroying the very environment they celebrate.

And the environmental clock is ticking. The industry is having to survive in ever-decreasing seasons. Winters are generally shorter by a month compared to 30 years ago and experts predict that we're heading to exceed the 2C global average temperature limit set at the Paris Agreement. This spells an end to the ski industry within the next 80 years in all but high or very northern locations. In the Alps, snow cover could drop by at least a third by the end of the century — leaving low-lying resorts unusable and forced to close. This sees the industry competing in an increasingly claustrophobic market. And it's a catch-22 situation — in order to survive, the ski industry needs global warming to halt, yet the way resorts are run is leaving a huge carbon footprint that's contributing to climate change.

Resorts are having to get smart to survive. Laax, in Switzerland, is working on a sustainability project called Greenstyle, with an aim to become the world's first self-sufficient ski resort. ""We need snow but right now snow needs us,"" says Reto Fry, sustainability manager at the Weisse Arena Gruppe that runs Laax. ""Our goal is to eliminate our CO2 emissions and encourage others to join us.""

The Swiss resort has already cut its energy consumption by 15% over the past seven years, and it now acquires 100% of its energy from CO2-neutral sources, such as hydro, wind and solar power. Waste heat from its train engines is used to warm surrounding buildings, and there's an increasing number of charging stations for e-bikes and electric cars. Restaurants serve local produce with a smaller carbon footprint than the food that's often flown in to mountain resorts, and Laax has also added recycling stations and water fountains around the mountain, so skiers can avoid buying plastic bottles.

By 2023, Laax wants to have halved its waste and be oil-free (all lifts are already powered by hydroelectric power but oil is still used to heat some buildings).

Being environmentally-friendly is moving from fashion to necessary function. Ski lodges and hotels are competing for increasingly eco-aware customers with green infrastructure and initiatives. Even kit can be sustainable, with brands such as Picture making clothing from recycled materials, while skis and boards are moving towards ethically sourced bamboo by companies such as Lonely Mountain Skis, and Nix Snowsport Co.

Resorts, too, are realising that green credentials can win them more visitors. In Colorado, Wolf Creek has switched all its energy consumption to carbon-free solar power and its snowcat machines run on biodegradable grapeseed oil. Vail Resorts has also pledged to achieve zero carbon emissions across all its resorts by 2030, while in California, Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows ski area is set to be supplied by 100% renewable energy by the end of the year.

Closer to home, Chamonix plans to slash its carbon emissions by 20% by 2020. Its energy-saving projects — which include a free resort train for skiers — have earned it the Flocon Vert ('green snowflake'), a sustainability award given by Mountain Riders, a French group that campaigns for a more sustainable winter sports industry.

Villars, in Switzerland, has also introduced sustainability initiatives, which range from a fleet of hybrid buses to low-energy snowmaking systems and fitting public buildings with solar panels. Over in Lech, Austria CO2 emissions and air quality have been improved by building a biomass plant to provide heat and hot water, and by laying on a free bus service to remove reliance on cars.

But can skiing ever be truly eco? After all, most of us who fly to a resort are ramping up the planet's carbon emissions before we even get there. A typical one-way journey by plane to a ski resort creates around 122 kg of CO2 per person, while a journey by train emits 90% less (12 kg of CO2 per person), according to research by Best Foot Forward.

""Aviation is the fastest-growing contributor to global warming, so avoiding a flight when there's an easy alternative is probably the biggest single thing that any individual can do to cut their carbon footprint and limit their own impact on the environment,"" says Kate Andrews, co-founder of rail booking site, loco2.com.

The fastest journey from the UK to the Alps by train is around seven hours, (routes from London St Pancras to Moûtiers, Aime la Plagne and Bourg-Saint-Maurice), where onward transfers usually take between 10 and 40 minutes. Sounds too slow? Andrews claims that once you factor in airport check in, passport control, baggage collection and lengthy transfers, the difference isn't quite so hefty.

So, take the train to rack up those green points (Snowcarbon offers detailed journey planners, rail-ski packages and route info) but it's the in-resort infrastructure that also makes a heavy hit on the environment. Warmer winters means a worrying lack of snow, with most resorts relying significantly on cannons for a quick fix. These machines — which work through the night, spraying water mixed with nucleating agents into the freezing air to create artificial snow — have a considerable environmental impact. Across the Alps, artificial snow consumes the same amount of water each year as 1.5 million people — and in some regions, tap water is even used.

For Justin Francis, CEO of Responsible Travel, the arrival of snow cannons at virtually every major resort over the past decade is a worrying trend. Many resorts, including Laax which has 300 snow cannons, power them entirely by renewable energy and use water saved in artificial lakes — but not all. ""Between 200 and 600 litres of water are needed to make every square meter of snow,"" Francis says. ""One third of ski resorts in the French Alps now have drinking water shortages. So, there's a direct competition between the ski industry and providing water for local residents.""

As well as paling in comparison to the feeling of skiing on real powder, artificial snow is four times harder than natural snow — not fun if you take a tumble. ""Fake snow is less safe, and the chemicals used to make it leech back into the environment when it melts,"" Francis says. ""It's also expensive to produce, pushing up the price for ski passes. The downhill ski market is already declining, and it will continue to shrink partly due to the cost of producing fake snow.""

Over in America, Aspen powers its snow guns with grid electricity that's 39% renewable and growing, thanks to a collaborative effort between the utility and the resort. The Colorado resort is on track to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2020 from 2000 levels, having introduced renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. But for Auden Schendler, vice president of sustainability of Aspen Skiing Company, dealing with climate change is about more than solar panels and reusable water bottles — and political lobbying is key. He also says skiers wanting to reduce their impact on the environment while pursuing the sport they love should write to resort CEOs asking what they are doing on climate policy.

So, should we all stop skiing in order to save the environment? Not yet, says Auden. ""It's not skiing that the problem, it's how we power our economy. Nothing can be eco-friendly in a world running on fossil fuels. But if we can decarbonise, sure, skiing can be eco-friendly.""

1235,"Ok. I’ve been meaning to write this for a week now and decided to give it a go.

The Decline Of America And The West.

A recent article on the US dependence on China for rare minerals that are used in products from computers to engines to military parts, as well as China’s threat to stop exporting them to the US, is but one of many examples of what the core problems are in our nation, and in all Western nations.

Currently, China is the largest producer of these rare minerals and the biggest exporter of them. The dependency we have on China is dangerous, and a symptom of a deep underlying problem with the US that is the focus of this article.

So why not mine our own minerals, you may ask. Well, there are a few problems with this. One is that it would take several years to plan and build the necessary facilities to do this…and that’s not a luxury we have right now

The bigger problem I see is this. Consider the Left’s meltdown over fracking and drilling for oil here. The Marxists behind this insane anti drilling movement use the environment as a cloak to hide their real motivation…ensuring a weaker US becomes more dependent on the global community. In other words, it’s part of the Marxist movement towards a one world global order. Can’t have a strong, energy, mineral independent America.

The same protest over drilling and fracking will occur with mining for our own rare minerals. The same lawsuits, the same activist judge’s decisions to stop it, the same media backing and propaganda against it.

Forget the logistics that in itself would take years to do. The lawsuits and court rulings would make it all but impossible. And thus, we remain dependent on a nation that is our greatest enemy and threat.

How did we get here?

Consider the eviseration of US manufacturing. Over taxation, over regulation, and a growing anti corporation and business movement has forced many companies to ship their jobs and factories overseas. This is part of the plan to weaken the US, to weaken the nation / State in favor of globalism. Keep in mind that globalist see the US as the greatest obstacle to a one world order.

American manufacturing was once second to none. Leftist policies and a loss of vision have eroded our faith in American Exceptionalism, along with our manufacturing industry.

But again, how did we really reach this point?

Like most of the issues we face…from erosion of education, morals, values, the ‘Protestant Work Ethic’…all are the result of a deliberate, well organized, long running campaign of Ideological Subversion. The point and goal of it is to transform America from a free republic with a free market…to a Collectivist state with a socialized economy.

Just like the Left seeks to keep the INDIVIDUAL less prosperous and less free, thereby guaranteeing his or her dependence on government, the Left also seeks to keep America and other nations, less prosperous and less free, all but guaranteeing our dependence on a global order.

The idea that is America…the idea that the individual is greater than the collective…that smaller government is ideal for freedom to thrive…that there is a God who created us and endowed us with certain inalienable rights…is antithetical to communism and collectivism.

The idea of God Himself is diametrically opposed to the core of Collectivism.

So how did the Left achieve this?

The glue that holds a society together and is essential to its success and continuation, is the nuclear family. One man, one woman bonded by marriage, raising healthy children.

George Murdock, a mid 20th century anthropologist and sociologist, did the most in depth cross cultural study of the history of societies and discovered that one thing made a society successful…the nuclear family.

To the extent a society veered away from the NF to a critical level, that society failed.

So. Step one in destroying a free America was to attack the nuclear family.

Parts of this multi front attack were the sexual revolution, abortion, the mitant push for the gay lifestyle, rampant divorce, and the legalization of gay marriage.

Now don’t get me wrong. I’m not condemnig nor criticizing people who are gay. That’s not the issue. The use of the gay agenda to attack the Nuclear Family IS the issue.

Another front in the war on our values is the attack on Christianity. Cultural Marxism, the brain child of Italian communist Antonio Gramsci, seeks to eradicate God from not only public life, but from the very heart of the individual.

A broken family makes that all the more easy.

Consider the generation of WW2. We call them the greatest generation because of their love for America, their faith, their dedication, their sacrifice, and their work ethic.

Young men volunteered to fight the evil of Collectivism embodied in Germany and Japan.

Young and old women volunteerd to work in factories to produce the materials we needed to win.

What gave us the motive to do all this wasn’t simply love of country. It was faith in God and strong family bonds.

Slowly, the work of subversion had eroded all this.

Unions, which serve a purpose, have become nothing more than legalized extortion rackets. Unions are ripe with leftist leaders who tell their members that they are not only entitled to more money and perks, but also the wealth of the company!

Workers of the world, UNITE! Gee, where have we heard that before?

Just look at what they did to Detroit and the American auto industry. Detroit is a wasteland and 

 The UAW union owns part of the auto companies now!

Any business that would seek to make a profit has no choice but to go overseas. Less taxes or none. Hardly any business killing regulations, and no unions.

All according to the plan.

But it’s not just the unions. What about us? We are conditioned to expect and demand far more than what an adventurous entrepreneur sacrificed to give us…a job to house and feed our families.

We demand higher pay so we can own 2 cars, a bigger home, go on vacation every year, buy computers and cell phones for each of our children. Give our kids the most expensive clothes and sneakers.

“Ask not what your country (or employer) can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.” – JFK.

The greatest generation asked what they could do for America, and they stepped up. Imagine asking this generation? They’re hiding in safe spaces, triggered emotionally by words or phrases they were conditioned to react to, and think they are entitled to the best.

They never experienced the pain of failure. They were never taught to do without. They’re told they’re all special and get trophys for losing.

In no way are they taught by our leftist educators that America is the greatest nation on earth. To the contrary, they are taught we and the West are the problem in this world…

From claiming Columbus committed Genocide to the slavery of the past, our kids are cut off from the riches of Western history and told lies about our nation.

Our youth are conditioned not to apply themselves, not succeed, not think, and expect a high quality of life in return.

They’re told global warming is real and America is the biggest culprit. They’re told unless we transfer our wealth to other nations, the earth will end in 12 years! Of course China and Russia are exempt from any climate change protocols.

Remember. It’s about weakening the US and making us dependent on a global government.

The other day, I met a 91 year old woman who volunteers to work at a NYC hospital three days a week. She took pride in her work and her appearance. She told me it takes her a half hour to get to work and longer to get home.

I’ve also seen young people at work who get paid to be there. Some of them make it obvious they don’t want to be there, they do the bare minimum, and collect a check.

The difference between past generations and now couldn’t be any more obvious.

Consider the loss of faith and the decline of organized religion. Now some of it has to do with the sins of the church, but most of it is part of the process of subversion.

How many times have you heard someone say they don’t have to go to Church to experience God…that he’s everywhere…as they continue to ignore him?

Now I’m not criticizing. Lord knows my faults. I’m explaining the subversion process and its results.

Like every war, it is essential to know your enemy and their methods to achieve victory. This culture war we find ourselves in is no different.

Once you know the Left and their history… How the Soviets used American leftists to infiltrate government and other institutions, particularly education to dumb down, subvert, divide, and make us more accepting of socialism, the better equipped you are to fight them.

So, in closing, the dependency we have on other nations is a symptom of the real problem…a long, concerted, well organized plot to weaken and destroy the America we know.

Just like the Left fosters dependency on government through implementing deliberately designed to fail policies and programs, the Global left is also doing the same to America.

Ask yourself why they want open borders and uncontrolled immigration from particular nations.

Ask why they want to deplete our military.

Ask why they abandoned reason and claim there’s more than two genders.

Ask why they vilify the rich.

Ask why they teach kids about giving back to the community, encourage activism, but fail to teach them about true economics. They discourage the entrepreneur and encourage working for govt and other groups dedicated to leftist causes.

Recognize a war when its declared on you, your values, the nation you love, your God, and your nuclear family.

1043,"A national climate emergency has been declared by the UK Parliament.

MPs are calling on the government to make changes that include setting a new target of reaching net zero emissions before 2050.

The current target is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050.

In Scotland, a climate change emergency had already been declared - and targets are being set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045.

Dozens of local areas around the UK have also said there is a climate emergency - but what does the term mean?

There's no single definition, but many areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030.

The United Nations says we could have just 11 years left to limit a climate change catastrophe.

Bristol councillor Carla Denyer first put forward the idea of a local area declaring a climate emergency and in November the city council passed the motion.

""We are acknowledging we are in an emergency situation,"" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat - speaking before the UK and Scottish governments made their pledges.

She says it's not just about reducing carbon emissions on a local scale, but also raising awareness about climate change and trying to convince MPs so that changes can be made.

""The national government needs to declare an emergency and put resources in place to enable councils to help reduce carbon emissions.

""It's the first step to radical action.""

Where else has declared a climate emergency?

In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had already declared a climate emergency at the SNP conference in April.

She said she was inspired after meeting young climate campaigners who had gone on strike from school

Dozens of local areas have copied Carla's motion and declared climate emergencies including Manchester, London, Edinburgh and Bath.

Smaller parish and town councils have also asserted their own declarations to put pressure on government.

The small market town of Machynlleth in west Wales declared a climate emergency in January.

The town is looking at things like improving the energy efficiency of buildings and creating an electric car club to help it become carbon-zero by 2030.

What has all this got to do with recent strikes and protests?

Thousands of students from across the UK and around the world have walked out of lessons to protest about climate change.

One of their key demands, according to the UK Student Climate Network, is that they want the government to declare a climate emergency.

They also want the national curriculum reformed to include ""the ecological crisis as an educational priority"".

And Extinction Rebellion - the group who held recent protests in UK cities including London, Manchester and Newcastle - also wants a new legally binding target set for the UK to reduce its carbon emissions to net zero by 2025.

'Climate change needs to be a much bigger issue in everyday conversation'

Sam Appleton, 21, has put his degree on hold at Oxford University to become a climate change activist.

He's told Newsbeat he thinks the most effective thing to make governments change their policies is activism.

""I've come to the conclusion that this has to work this year if we are to avoid any future crises - we've only got 12 years.

""In my eyes, climate change should be treated like there's a war going on and it should be the only thing people and MPs are talking about, not Brexit.""

He says although small lifestyle changes like swapping car journeys for cycling are important - changes in policy are more important.

What does the government say?

In the Spring Statement, the Chancellor announced gas heating for new houses will be banned by 2025, as part of plans to address the concerns of those protesting about climate change.

While that move was welcomed by environmental campaigners, many said the government hadn't gone far enough.

In a statement to Newsbeat in March, the government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: ""Climate change is one of the most urgent and pressing challenges we face today, and the UK is a world leader in tackling this problem.

962,"How did humankind deal with the extreme challenges of the last Ice Age? How have the relatively benign post-Ice Age conditions affected the evolution and spread of humanity across the globe? By setting our genetic history in the context of climate change during prehistory, the origin of many features of our modern world are identified and presented in this illuminating book. It reviews the aspects of our physiology and intellectual development that have been influenced by climatic factors, and how features of our lives - diet, language and the domestication of animals - are also the product of the climate in which we evolved. In short: climate change in prehistory has in many ways made us what we are today. Climate Change in Prehistory weaves together studies of the climate with anthropological, archaeological and historical studies, and will fascinate all those interested in the effects of climate on human development and history.

""Quoting from and bringing together evidence from a very wide range and long list of references, Bill Burroughs presents a compelling argument for the profound effect of the stabilisation of climate into and through the Holocene on humanity using, in particular, ice-core proxy data as a measure of climate. Intended for a general readership of interested readers, I recommend this well-written, readable overview to all.""

968,"Billy Graham was an evangelist at revival meetings, and on radio and television for over 40 years.

William Franklin Graham, Jr. was born on November 7, 1918, in Charlotte, North Carolina, to parents William and Morrow Graham. Graham was the first of four children raised on the family's dairy farm in Charlotte. In hindsight, there was little indication that Graham would one day preach the Christian gospel to as many as 215 million people in live audiences over 185 countries. Graham has been credited with preaching to more individuals than anyone else in history, not counting the additional millions he has addressed through radio, television and the written word. While Graham's parents were strict Calvinists, it would be an unfamiliar traveling evangelist who would set Graham on a profound spiritual path. At the age of 16, Graham attended a series of revival meetings run by evangelist Mordecai Ham. Despite the fact that Graham was a well-behaved adolescent, Ham's sermons on sin spoke to young Graham. After high school, Graham moved to Tennessee to enroll in the conservative Christian school, Bob Jones College. However, he felt disconnected from the school's rigid doctrine and soon transferred to the Florida Bible Institute. While in Florida, Graham joined a Southern Baptist Convention church, where he was ordained in 1939. After graduating from the Florida Bible Institute with a bachelor's in theology, Graham moved to Illinois and enrolled at Wheaton College for further spiritual training. He also met his future wife, Ruth McCue Bell, at this time. Bell was the daughter of a missionary and lived with her family in China until she turned 17. After graduating with a bachelor's in anthropology, Graham and Bell were married on August 13, 1943. They would eventually raise five children together.

Graham briefly pastored the First Baptist Church in Western Springs, Illinois, before leaving to join Youth for Christ, an evangelical missionary group that spoke to returning servicemen and young people about God. In 1947, Graham became president of Northwestern Schools, a group of Christian schools in Minnesota. In 1948, he resigned from Youth for Christ and focused on Northwestern Schools until 1952, when he resigned to concentrate on preaching. It did not take long for people to identify with Graham's charismatic and heartfelt gospel sermons. In 1949, a group called ""Christ for Greater Los Angeles"" invited Graham to preach at their L.A. revival. When radio personality Stuart Hamblen had Graham on his radio show, word of the revival spread. The publicity filled Graham's tents and extended the revival for an additional five weeks. At the urging of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, papers around the nation covered Graham's revival meetings closely. As a consequence, Graham became a Christian superstar. Sociologically it is believed that Graham's success was directly related to the cultural climate of post-WWII America. Graham spoke out against the evils of Communism—one of the biggest fears threatening the American consciousness. In a 1954 interview, Graham stated, ""Either communism must die, or Christianity must die, because it is actually a battle between Christ and anti-Christ."" With the advent of nuclear weapons and the demonstrated fragility of life, people turned to spirituality for comfort, and Graham illuminated their path. Thus, Graham helped bind together a vulnerable nation through a religious revival. By glazing over the finer details of Christianity and focusing on more moderate doctrines, Graham made evangelism enticing, non-threatening, even easy — and the media made his messages accessible to the masses.

To expand and maintain a professional ministry, Graham and his colleagues eventually incorporated the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA). Graham began broadcasting his sermons over the radio during a Christian show called Songs in the Night. Once a week he also hosted a program called The Hour of Decision, a program ABC initially transmitted to 150 stations before reaching its peak of 1,200 stations across America. Eventually, this program was converted into a television show which ran for three years. The success of Graham's radio and television programs speak to his role as a Christian media visionary. Graham used the media as a means for spreading the gospel of Christ, allowing him to access millions of people around the globe. With Graham's success, BGEA opened numerous international offices and started publishing periodicals, records, tapes, films and books. BGEA also accepted invitations from religious figures around the world to hold evangelical ""crusades."" Scouts would be sent to these cities to reserve a venue, organize volunteer choirs and arrange speakers. At the end of these events, audience members would be invited to commit to Christ and meet with volunteer counselors. These new recruits would be given workbooks for at-home bible study and referrals to local evangelist pastors. BGEA eventually began to air footage of these crusades on national television with subscriber information. In 1952, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association created the Billy Graham Evangelistic Film Ministry as a means of distributing personal conversion stories to the public through films. BGEA also acquired several radio stations around America in an effort to broadcast Graham's radio shows to a wider audience. In terms of print media, BGEA created Christianity Today in 1955. This magazine continues to be the leading journal for evangelical Christians. In 1958, BGEA started Decision magazine, a monthly mailer with bible studies, articles, church histories and crusade updates. Eventually, this magazine was published in Spanish, French and German. Additionally, Graham himself authored numerous books including such titles as Angels: God's Secret Agents (1975), How to be Born Again (1979), Death and the Life After (1994) and The Journey: Living by Faith in an Uncertain World (2006). Billy Graham speaks from the podium at a Billy Graham rally on June 13, 2003 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Graham's detractors have criticized him for being too liberal and refusing to play into partisan politics. Fundamentalists wrote him off when he condemned violence perpetrated by the anti-abortion group ""Operation Rescue."" Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr has called him ""simplistic,"" while evangelist Bob Jones believes Graham has done ""more harm to the cause of Jesus Christ than any other living man."" President Harry S. Truman even went so far as to call Graham a ""counterfeit."" Some anti-Semitic comments between Graham and President Richard Nixon were also caught on tape in 1972. However, through his long and extraordinary career, Graham has overwhelmingly been regarded in a positive light, one Time reporter calling him ""the Pope of Protestant America."" Another reporter from USA Today writes, ""He was the evangelist who did not rip off millions (Jim Bakker) or run with prostitutes (Jimmy Swaggart) or build a megachurch (Joel Osteen) or run for president (Pat Robertson) or run a Christian political lobby (Jerry Falwell)."" Graham's integrity has encouraged millions to heed his spiritual guidance, including Martin Luther King Jr., Bono, Muhammad Ali and several United States presidents. He has been rated by the Gallup organization as ""One of the Ten Most Admired Men in the World"" a staggering 51 times. He is regarded by contemporaries as humorous, non-judgmental, sincere, innocent and accepting.

Graham was awarded the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation Freedom Award, the Congressional Gold Medal, the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion, the Big Brother Award, the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, and the Speaker of the Year Award. Additionally, Graham was recognized by the National Conference of Christians and Jews for promoting understanding between faiths and bestowed with the Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). In 1992, Graham announced that he was diagnosed with hydrocephalus, a disease similar to Parkinson's Disease. His son William Franklin Graham III was chosen to take over BGEA upon his father's retirement. Billy and his wife Ruth eventually retired to their home in Montreat, North Carolina, in 2005. In 2007, Ruth Graham passed away from pneumonia and degenerative osteoarthritis. Graham went to a celebration for his 95th birthday in Asheville, North Carolina, in November 2013. Roughly 900 people attended the event. Around this time, Graham released what was called his final sermon. In a video entitled My Hope America, he expressed concern for the spiritual health of the nation. ""Our country's in great need of a spiritual awakening,"" he said, according to a report in USA Today. ""There have been times that I've wept as I've gone from city to city and I've seen how far people have wandered from God."" Graham passed away at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, on February 21, 2018, at the age of 99. Although his health had been in decline in recent years, he reportedly died of natural causes.",mainstream
560,"Inequality between countries has decreased over the past few decades. But between 1961 and 2010, the country-to-country gap would have narrowed more if not for climate change, says new research published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The difference between the richest and poorest countries in the world is some 25 percent wider than it would be in a world without global warming, the authors say.

Until now, we didn't have a number that showed “how much the global warming that's already happened has impacted the growth of existing countries, and the harm that’s already occurred,"" says Noah Diffenbaugh, an author of the study and a climate scientist at Stanford University. And critically, he says, “The countries that are most responsible for global warming are different from the countries that are bearing the brunt of global warming.”

Economists, development experts, and world leaders have long warned that climate change is likely to hurt poor countries more than rich ones. Recovering from disasters like hurricanes or floods or drought is more challenging when resources are thin, and extra heat hurts more when humans and crops are already near their limits— the case for many countries in the climate-sensitive tropics.

 

 “So even without this added economic penalty, those poorer places would bear the brunt of climate change,” says Amir Jina, an environmental policy expert at the University of Chicago.

 

 Much of the research on the social and economic impacts of climate change looked into the future, years or decades or centuries ahead. But in recent years, scientists have begun to tease out exact calculations of how much climate change has already affected us. In 2017, for example, they established that Hurricane Harvey dumped about 15 percent more rain than it would have in an un-climate-changed world.

 

 Diffenbaugh and Marshall Burke, the authors of the new study, realized they could apply the same kind of approach to economies. Burke and colleagues had shown a few years prior that there is a remarkable relationship between the average annual temperature in a country and its economic output. Places whose temperature hovered around 13 degrees Celsius, or about 55 degrees Fahrenheit (like China and the U.S.), have the highest economic productivity in the world. The farther away from that peak a country was, the less productive they were.

 

 It didn't matter if a country was rich or poor: The Goldilocks-esque relationship held. Colder countries didn't produce as much. Nor did hotter countries, and their economic penalty was even greater, especially when average temperatures crept above 20 degrees Celsius, or 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

The exact reasons why this relationship existed are still being worked out, and there’s no one factor that controls the effect globally. In some cases, hotter temperatures may make it harder for people to work, and in others, it may affect the agricultural output, amongst many other effects. But the overall pattern is clear.

 

 And it suggested an obvious next question: As the climate warmed over the past decades, had colder countries benefited economically? And were hotter countries paying a penalty? How much of the stubborn inequality between countries can be ascribed to climate change?

Who’s fault is climate change? And who pays the price?

Globally, economic inequality—the difference between the poorest countries and the richest countries—has narrowed over past decades (by one measure, it dropped by about 15 percent between 1975 and 2010). But what Diffenbaugh and Burke found was that between 1961 to 2010, that gap would have narrowed by about 25 percent more, had global warming not been a factor.

The penalty was particularly acute for tropical countries, which were already on the hotter end of the spectrum and far more sensitive to increases in heat. But the researchers also found something else in the data: Many of the countries in the temperate Goldilocks zone, which already tended to be richer, had even seemed to gain some slight ineffable economic benefit from the warming. As temperatures in many of those countries crept up, so did their economic output.

The study looks only at the relationship between temperature and economic measures, but does not dig in to identify the underlying reasons they might be connected, cautions Solomon Hsiang, an expert in climate and development at the University of California, Berkeley. Without those direct links, and without thinking about how past warming could have impacts that play out on longer timescales (the authors primarily focused on immediate economic responses to temperature, within a year), it’s premature to say that any countries have benefited from climate change, he says. And in fact, there is growing evidence that climate change hurts all countries, both rich and poor—so the small advantages seen here are likely to dissipate.

In contrast, the 18 countries with the lowest CO2 emissions per person (less than 10 tons per person in total over the years between 1961 to 2010, or about as much as the average American blows through in about seven and a half months today), took economic hits of over 25 percent.

“We already knew that the countries most vulnerable to climate change did not contribute much to emissions that caused that same climate change,” says Celine Guivarch, a climate change and policy expert at CIRED, the International Research Center on Environment and Development, in Paris. “We now have the quantification of how much. That has profound implications for justice between countries going forward.”

Climate-vulnerable countries have stressed this point during international climate negotiations. During discussions preceding the Paris Climate Agreement, in 2015, Indian delegates pressed for “climate reparations” from the wealthy countries who were responsible for the bulk of the planet-warming CO2 emissions in the past. And a coalition of island nations, led by the Marshall Islands, fought hard to get the richer, less-threatened nations to aim to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, rather than the 2 degrees Celsius goal that had dominated the early part of the negotiations.

Climate change is likely to cost everyone, everywhere, especially as its effects ramp up, Diffenbaugh is careful to point out. And he stresses that their analysis doesn’t explicitly address the costs of disasters, adaptation and mitigation, and many other factors that could wipe out economic gains in the future.",mainstream

Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, warns: “If we don’t act now, in 2040 the picture will be bleak. The climate crisis is happening right now – and far closer to home than many would like to think.”

Soaring temperatures in the summer of 2018 and this year led to moors such as Saddleworth burning for days on end.

Joe Wheeler grew up nearby and is fighting to protect Saddleworth from raging fires. And the 18-year-old, from Oldham, Gtr Manchester, says: “The best way to describe it was catastrophic.

“The sky was orange and filled with smoke, it’s all you could see and smell.

“We’ve seen how climate change affects us on a local level – there’s no denying it’s happening.

“We’re having heatwaves and not as much rain during the summer, so the land is dry and prone to burning.

“If that’s happening now, come 40 years down the line what will it be like?”

The moors are areas of peatland, a valuable type of ecosystem that preserves global biodiversity, provides safe drinking water and minimises flood risk.

But when peat burns, it releases huge amounts of CO2.

RSPB site manager Kate Hanley says: “We rely heavily on volunteers for restoration work, which is absolutely vital.

“It makes the landscape more resistent to drought, which is a contributing factor towards the fires, and more resistent towards the fires themselves.”

Scientists say climate change is driving up sea levels and increasing the likelihood of bigger storms, meaning that the rate of erosion is likely to rise.

Malcolm Kerby, 78, is co-ordinator at Norfolk-based Coastal Concern Action Group, which is fighting for improved sea defences in vulnerable communities such as Happisburgh. He believes climate change is responsible for the acceleration of erosion cases.

He says: “Climate change is a definite element because we are seeing more regular violent storms, which can only really be related to the bigger picture.

“It’s going to get much worse globally and could be an absolute disaster for the UK. Government will need to tackle the problem or we’ll see a much smaller UK in the long run.”

On February 26, Kew Gardens, in South West London, recorded a temperature of 21.2C – the highest on record for a winter month.

Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said it bears “the fingerprint of climate change”.

He said: “Earlier this year we had the warmest winter day on record.

""We also had the hottest temperature ever officially recorded occurring within the one year and although there’s little to link those two events, there’s the suspicion that these temperatures are being increased because of 

climate change.

“Certainly, the fingerprint of climate change is in a lot of these records. To see temperatures of over 20C on a winter’s day is exceptional.”

Extreme heatwaves could be the norm by the 2040s, causing heat-related deaths in the UK to triple.

According to NASA, the average global temperature has increased by about 0.8C since 1880. Two-thirds of that has occurred since 1975.

Green spaces cut excessive heat but urban green space in England has declined from 63% in 2001 to 56% in 2016.

Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the National Climate Information Centre, says in a new report: “A UK summer temperature comparable to extreme summers like 2018 or 1976 now has a likelihood of 11-12% of occurring in any given year.

“That is 30 times more likely than would be expected from natural factors alone.”

The temperature hit 35.3C in Faversham, Kent, in 2018.

The residents of sea-threatened Fairbourne could be our first community to be relocated because of climate change.

Maintenance of sea defences will stop in the 2050s but Gwynedd council may begin “decommissioning” the village before then and moving residents out.

Dr Emily Grossman believes that Fairbourne, on the edge of Snowdonia National Park, will be the first of many 

such relocations.

She says: “As global temperatures continue to increase, ice caps are melting and sea levels are rising.

“Over the next decade it is likely this will lead to an increasing number of communities being forced to relocate as a result of flooding.”

Brutal Atlantic storms in 2013/14 led to the collapse of a stretch of sea wall at Dawlish Warren, taking railway track with it.

That winter the UK was battered by storms so severe, scientists analysed the weather to see if it was linked to climate change.

They found climate change did increase the risk of severe storms that hit the South.

Dr Emily Grossman, co-founder of Scientists for Extinction Rebellion, says: “Average global temperatures are set to continue to rise, due to our failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“Increasing temperatures result not only in more water evaporating off the oceans and falling as rain but also disruption to our natural weather systems in the UK.

“This means that over the next decade, the UK is very likely to feel the catastrophic impacts of more frequent severe storms.”

The Beast from the East and storm Emma wreaked havoc last winter. Communities in Cumbria, including the village of Nenthead, were buried in 20ft snowdrifts.

Professor Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, says: “It is fair to say that we had snow before we started talking about climate change.

“What we can say is that the extreme weather events we are witnessing are in line with climate change – extreme heat, flooding, cold.

""The atmosphere is one degree warmer now than in 1850 and when you energise the atmosphere you are going to have more extreme events.

“I don’t think any climate scientist would say anything other than we’ve been expecting these conditions.

“It was an expectation of climate change and now we are seeing it.”

Last summer, the Wayoh Reservoir dried up in the heat, turning much of it into a cracked dust bowl. And it could be a similar picture elsewhere in the near future.

The chief executive of the Environment Agency, Sir James Bevan, warns that in around 25 years, England will not have enough water to meet demand.

And Sir James said we must act to avoid that “jaws of death” – when demand exceeds supply. In 2003, 20,000 people died during a European heatwave, thought to be the hottest for up to 500 years.

“By 2040, we expect more than half of our summers to exceed those 2003 temperatures,” Sir James said earlier this year.

“That will mean more water shortages: by 2050, some rivers seeing 50%-80% less water during the summer months.” He wants average household consumption of 140 litres a day cut to 100 litres.

Average sea levels have risen more than 8in since 1880. About three of those inches was gained in the past 25 years.

British resorts such as Weston-super-Mare are at risk of being submerged in the future.

A Somerset county council report in 2010 predicted rising sea levels could have “severe impacts on coastal and low-lying areas of the county”.

By 2080, it warned of winters up to 30% wetter and summers that will be 55% drier.

Green Party councillor Bridget Petty says that the authority is doing all it can to stop this from happening.

“As a community we are already suffering with recent heavy rainfall which is likely to get worse with climate change.

“North Somerset council is very concerned by the threat of climate change.”

Flooding across the North of England is destroying homes and even claiming lives.

Hebden Bridge, in West Yorkshire, has experienced devastating flash floods in the past decade and communities fear more is on the way unless the Government takes urgent action.

Anthony Rae, co-ordinator of Calderdale Friends of the Earth, says locals are anxious about another flood after Hebden Bridge was hit in 2012 and 2015. Just last week they had another scare when the river nearly burst its banks.

“Hebden Bridge has flooded before but 2015 was by far the worst,” Anthony says. “And we’ve had one or two other scares.

“Climate science predicts we will be getting worsening weather. And lo and behold, we have.

“Calderdale, quite rightly, is one of the councils that has declared a climate emergency.”

The community in Hebden Bridge is working hard to lead natural flood management, with a number of voluntary schemes making a huge difference.",mainstream

876,"Ross River virus (RRV) disease is the most frequently notified arboviral disease in Australia, and the burden of this disease to Australian society is significant. We have studied the incidence of RRV disease between 1992 and 2003 in South Australia. Our findings suggest that the incidence of the disease in South Australia over the study period was relatively stable. There were four epidemics in the study period, with the majority of cases acquired from regions along the River Murray. There was some evidence of spread of the disease to regions in which activity of RRV had not been previously recognised, such as the Mid-North and the South-East. In terms of disease distribution amongst the population, it was found that the highest rates occurred in the 30–49 year age range. There was no significant difference in disease rates between males and females. In order to facilitate further research into RRV disease transmission, we recommend that the suspected region of acquisition be a mandatory component of the national notification dataset. Commun Dis Intell 2005;29:291–296.

Ross River virus (RRV) causes a non-fatal disease in humans, and it has been estimated that between 70 and 90 per cent of people infected with RRV have either mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.1,2 The typical features of RRV disease are joint pain and swelling (mainly in the extremities), lethargy, myalgia, rash (involving the trunk and limbs), fever, headache and depression.3,4,5,6 With thousands of cases occurring in Australia each year, the burden of this disease to Australian society is significant; for example, it has been estimated that the direct and indirect health costs are in the tens of millions of dollars per year, and this is without taking into account the significant but intangible costs of the pain and suffering of the individual cases.3,7,8,9

RRV disease is the most common arboviral disease in Australia, and the virus has been isolated from more than 40 species of mosquito. Being a mosquito-borne disease, the distribution of RRV disease is closely tied to environmental conditions, as the availability of habitat and factors such as rainfall and temperature have a large influence on mosquito populations. The disease is endemic in the tropical regions of Australia, where the climate is conducive to mosquito breeding during the wet season. In the more temperate southern regions of Australia, the disease occurs relatively infrequently outside of epidemics.

In South Australia, the first reported epidemic occurred in 1956, when approximately 200 cases were reported from regions along the River Murray.10,11 The disease has been notifiable in South Australia since 1980.5

The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence and distribution of RRV disease in South Australia for the period July 1992 to June 2003, and so extend the work done by Mudge, Cameron, Weinstein and others, whose descriptions of RRV disease in South Australia cover the period from its first detection in 1956 up to the summer of 1992/93.5,12,13

Data regarding notified cases of RRV disease for the study period were sourced from both the Australian Government and South Australian health departments (see acknowledgements). Data were obtained at the national level so that disease rates in South Australia could be compared with other parts of Australia. This national dataset consisted of the age and sex of the cases, as well as the Statistical Local Area (SLA) of their residence and the date of onset of symptoms. In addition to these fields, the South Australian dataset recorded SLA where the infection was thought to have been acquired, as recorded on the form completed by the notifying medical practitioner. For cases where this suspected region of acquisition had not been recorded, the place of residence was used as a substitute.

The analytical approach applied to these data was the traditional epidemiological method of classifying and comparing cases by time, person and place. Disease rates were derived from 2001 census data (SLA residential populations by age and sex) obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Electronic maps were produced using a computer software tool ('Csmart') developed by the South Australian Department of Health.

There were 2,294 notifications of RRV disease to the South Australian health department during the study period (Figure 1), with the median annual rate being 3.8 cases per 100,000 population (Figure 2); these were considered confirmed cases on the basis that there was either a fourfold or greater change in serum antibody titres between acute and convalescent-phase serum specimens or there was demonstration of specific IgM antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or acute-phase serum or there was isolation of the virus from blood, CSF or tissue specimens.

Figure 2. Ross River virus notifications per 100,000 per year, South Australia, July 1992 to June 2003

Figure 1 highlights the four epidemics that occurred during the study period, which accounted for almost 90 per cent of the cases during the study period. The 1992/93 epidemic, with over 800 notifications, was the largest epidemic in South Australia on record.10,11 Epidemics followed in 1996/97, with over 650 cases notified, and in 1999/00 and 2000/01, with more than 250 cases notified in each. These data suggest a general pattern of epidemics in South Australia every three to four years, and that over the study period the epidemics became smaller in terms of the number of notified cases.

The peak months for the first three epidemics were February and March. For the 2000/01 epidemic however, the peak period was between November and February (Figure 1). Across the entire study period, over half the cases occurred in February and March, and almost 80 per cent occurred in the months January to April.

Figure 3 shows the age-specific rates for each of the four epidemic years. In each of these epidemics the rates in young children, teenagers and people aged over 70 years were relatively low, and the highest rates consistently occurred in the 30–49 years age range. For Australia for the study period, the highest annual rates also occurred in the 30–39 years (38 cases per 100,000 population) and the 40–49 years (37 cases per 100,000 population) age ranges.

Figure 3. Ross River virus age-specific rates per 100,000 per epidemic year, South Australia, July 1992 to June 2003

The male to female ratio for the study period was 1.1:1, which was consistent with an underlying ratio of 1 (c 2 = 2.26, df = 1, p > 0.1) and with the ratio for Australia for the same period (1:1).

There was no significant difference in the male:female ratio across age groups (Figure 4). The age group with the male to female ratio furthest from one was children aged less than ten years; this age group had a ratio of 1.7:1, but this value was based on only 16 cases.

Figure 4. Ratio of males to females, South Australia, 1992 to 2003, by age group

Of the 2,294 South Australian notifications, 208 had a suspected region of acquisition outside of South Australia, and another 32 had neither a region of acquisition nor a place of residence recorded. Of the remaining 2,054 cases, 538 cases had no region of acquisition recorded and a further 155 cases had region of acquisition recorded as 'indeterminate' (e.g. 'Riverlands (indeterminate)', 'Far north (indeterminate)'). For these 693 cases (34% of 2,054), the region of acquisition was set to the place of residence. For the 1,569 cases where the region of acquisition had been recorded, the region of acquisition differed from the region of residence in 647 (41%) cases.

The region of acquisition most commonly reported were the Riverland (730 cases) and the Murray Mallee (321 cases). The next most prominent regions were the Eyre Peninsula, Adelaide, the Far North and the Flinders Ranges, with 151, 143, 127 and 117 cases respectively (see Figure 5).

Figure 5. Distribution of Ross River virus cases, South Australia, July 1992 to June 2003, by suspected region of acquisition

Regions along the River Murray were major foci of RRV disease in each of the four epidemic years. In 1992/93, there was also significant activity (at least 10 cases) in coastal regions such as Whyalla, the Lower Yorke Peninsula and the Lower Eyre Peninsula. In 1996/97, the activity tended to be further north, with no cases in either the Lower Yorke Peninsula or the Lower Eyre Peninsula. In 1999/00, activity again tended to be further north, with few cases in the south and again, no cases in either the Lower Yorke Peninsula or the Lower Eyre Peninsula. However, the following year, there were few cases in the northern part of South Australia, many more cases in the southern part, and cases re-appeared in the Yorke Peninsula and the Eyre Peninsula.

Over the study period, cases were acquired from every region in rural South Australia. Compared to the 1992/93 epidemic, the proportion of cases in the Riverland and Murray Mallee regions post-1992/93 dropped from 56 per cent to 42 per cent; in contrast, there was a greater proportion of cases post-1992/93 arising from the Eyre Peninsula, the Flinders Ranges and the Far North (Table).

Table. Percentage of Ross River virus cases, South Australia, 1992/93 and post-1992/93, by suspected region of acquisition

There were three epidemics of RRV disease in South Australia in the decade following the record-level outbreak of 1992/93. The mean number of notifications for these three epidemics was over 400 cases per year, compared to over 800 cases in 1992/93. For the seven non-epidemic years, the average number of cases was less than 40 per year. While the study period was relatively short, the notification data suggest that the incidence of RRV disease in South Australia is not rising. This may not be the case for other parts of Australia, as a number of authors have recently stated that the incidence of RRV disease in Australia is increasing.3,14

The number of notified cases is generally considered an under-estimate of the true incidence of RRV disease, i.e. the notification fraction is less than one.8 The fraction itself is very difficult to precisely estimate, but some researchers have estimated it to be less than 0.5 per cent.15 It is therefore always difficult to meaningfully interpret incidence rates which are derived from notification data. Furthermore, the national notification dataset for RRV disease only covers the period since 1991, and so the time-frame of available data may not be sufficient to reveal underlying trends. Prior to 1991, the methods for diagnosis and reporting of RRV disease were less standardised, and so meaningful comparisons would be difficult to make.8

Selden and Cameron concluded that in the 1992/93 South Australian epidemic the virus was being acquired in regions well away from the traditional areas along the River Murray, suggesting that the virus was spreading to regions in which activity of RRV had not been previously recognised.5 The data in this study also suggest that RRV disease has spread into more regions of South Australia over the study period, particularly the northern parts of South Australia.

Of the 68 rural and 56 metropolitan SLAs in South Australia, 53 and 34 of them, respectively, reported cases during the epidemic of 1992/93. Four rural SLAs reported cases for the first time in the epidemic of 1996/97 and four more SLAs reported cases for the first time during the following three years. Of these eight SLAs, three were in the south around Mount Gambier and three were around Port Pirie in the mid-north. Such a finding might be due not only to spread of the virus, but also the result of increased awareness and recognition by medical practitioners, improved laboratory diagnostic methods, and increased encroachment by humans into areas conducive to mosquito breeding, such as wetlands.7

In order to study the spread of the virus, it is important that the suspected region of acquisition be collected for all cases. One of the limitations of the national dataset is that the suspected region of acquisition is not routinely collected, and so studies which have utilised these data have generally been required to use the place of residence as a proxy for the region of acquisition. Such approximations may not be very problematic in the endemic, northern regions of Australia, where the region of acquisition is often likely to be the same as the place of residence, but may be more problematic for a region such as South Australia, where most of the population lives in metropolitan Adelaide where the disease is not endemic, and so for many cases the disease is acquired as a result of travel to an endemic region. It is therefore recommended that the routine collection of suspected region of acquisition be carried out in all Australian states and territories, and that this information then also be recorded at the national level. More precise and complete data regarding the suspected region of acquisition will enable researchers to better understand the geographical distribution of RRV disease.

Epidemics occurred approximately every three to four years, with a large proportion of cases occurring along the River Murray. The distribution of cases away from the River Murray varied in each epidemic, with two epidemics affecting mainly the northern parts of South Australia, and the other two affecting the southern regions. The size of the epidemics, in terms of the number of notified cases, decreased over the study period. This reduction may reflect, at least in part, increasing levels of immunity in the South Australian population, particularly in endemic regions along the River Murray. While it is generally considered that RRV infection confers lifelong immunity, immunity to RRV is not well understood. A general practitioner in Berri (one of the major towns in the Riverland), noted that some patients reported symptoms of RRV disease during epidemic s in both 1971 and 1974, suggesting that infection with RRV may lead to only partial immunity in some people.16,17

This study showed that the age and sex distribution of RRV disease in South Australia during the study period was similar to that for Australia as a whole. It appears to be a disease primarily of young to middle-aged adults (30–50 years), and the male to female ratio is essentially one to one. The relatively low rates of disease in children and teenagers are thought to be due to a combination of reduced exposure to mosquitoes and a tendency for children to experience either sub-clinical or mild infections. The relatively low rates in those aged 70 or over are thought to be due to a combination of reduced exposure to mosquitoes and increased immunity due to previous infection.16

Much remains to be learnt about the incidence and distribution of RRV disease across Australia. More detailed data collection, particularly with regard to the suspected region of acquisition, will assist in the development of interventions aimed at reducing the impact of this significant public health issue.

469,"The Council is committed to tackling climate change and to making a major contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the city. Coventry was one of the first cities to produce a Climate Change Strategy. The Climate Change strategy published in 2012 set a target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 27.5% by the year 2020. Coventry achieved this in 2014 (6 years early). The current Climate Change Strategy for the City ends in 2020 and is now under review and needs to reflect current UK and global policy and the urgency of the climate crisis that we face if no action is taken. To strengthen the global response to climate change, 185 parties have ratified the 2016 Paris Agreement which aspires to keep global warming between 1.5oC and 2oC and prevent the widespread effects of climate change.

The 2008 Climate Change Act requires the UK to reduce its emissions by 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. However, the most recent Committee for Climate Change report indicates that the UK needs to be more ambitious and set net-zero carbon targets by 2050 or sooner and strong policies to make cities greener will need to be put into action. By setting a carbon target for Coventry, the new Climate Change Strategy will highlight the commitment we have to reducing our emissions and driving the shift toward a low carbon economy whilst continuing to meet the housing, transport and other needs of the city. Becoming a low carbon city will have wide ranging benefits such as job creation, industrial competitiveness and increased economic opportunities, energy security, improved public health, reducing inequality, social inclusion, ecosystem resilience, more green space, healthier lifestyles and improved accessibility.

The challenge of reducing the city's carbon emissions is significant and it will need the help of everyone in Coventry to achieve our goals.

47% of all UK CO2 emissions are linked to the construction and operation of buildings – both housing and commercial. Energy efficient buildings produce less CO2 emissions, are warmer, and are cheaper to run but without the necessary policies in places, they won’t be built, and we risk having to pay to retrofit today’s new homes with additional energy and carbon saving measures in ten, twenty or thirty years’ time.

With the adoption of the new Local Plan in December 2017, a new Energy Supplementary Planning Document is being proposed which will aim to deliver homes and commercial properties that are fit for the future and produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions.",mainstream
926,"I hate science, evidently, because I’m woke to the manifest truth about what the leftist elite currently calls “climate change.” It is the second most staggering fraud ever perpetrated upon the American people after the media’s promotion of the unstoppable candidacy of Beto (who is a furry). Like some suckers still do, I once believed that “science” was a rigorous process where you tested theories and revised those theories in response to objective evidence. But in today’s shabby practice, “science” is just a package of self-serving lies buttressing the transnational liberal elite’s preferred narrative. Our alleged betters hope that labeling their propaganda “science” will science-shame you into silence about what everyone knows is a scam.

Nah. “Climate change” is a hoax. Come arrest me for felony denial.

Understand that the term “climate change” does not refer to actual meteorological phenomena but, rather, to the sordid rat-king of lies, scams and power grabs that we are commanded to accept as pagan gospel lest we burn to a crisp or drown or suffer…whatever the Armageddon du jour is. When you say “climate change is a grift,” and you should as often as possible, you are pointing out that this green-on-the-outside/red-on-the-inside fake frenzy is really just a set of intertwined grifts transparently designed to separate you from your freedom and your property in the name of somehow adjusting the weather.

The underlying premise of their claims seems to be that there is a “right” temperature for the earth; watch them sputter when you enquire about that perfect setting for Earth’s thermostat. Remember, if you ask questions you hate “science.” If they did stop telling you how you hate “science” long enough to respond, they might explain that of course there’s no perfect temperature – it’s not like LA, where it’s always 72 degrees.

But then, what are they comparing the present climate to in order to declare that our climate is “getting worse?” If you establish a climate baseline, then you can compare what’s actually happening to the baseline and that might demonstrate that the whole thing is baloney. That would be awkward. It happened after Katrina. Oh, Katrina’s proof positive that Gaia is really ticked off and…and…and…then we had a bunch of years without much hurricane action at all. You might think that this would be evidence that maybe the climate wasn’t in chaos, and that they would be happy to be proven wrong, but no, it doesn’t work that way. Every time the weather fits the narrative, you see, it’s proof that the climate kooks are right, and every time the weather fails to fit the narrative, well, weather’s not climate. At least until the next heat wave or storm; then weather will totally be climate again.

Heads, you must give us all your freedom and money, and also tails, you must give us all your freedom and money.

Now, we’re being told that we’re all going to die in…I guess we’re down to what? About 11.5 years this go ‘round? Of course, we’ve been told many times that we’re doomed and the deadlines have come and gone with the doomsdayers not missing a beat. They’re like old timey Elmer Gantrys promising the apocalypse over and over again, with their hardcore true believers regularly showing up for the rapture over and over again no matter how many times the Four Horseman fail to turn up.

We haven’t even seen one horseman.

Back in the 70s, I remember we were promised an ice age if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom. Then in the 80s, we were promised death by ozone hole if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom, and then doom by acid rain if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom. By the time they started promising that we were all gonna die from global warming if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom, I was still wanting my ice age. It would be nice to have a white Christmas in LA.

Oh right, only a climate denier – Climate, I deny thee! – might wonder why we should hand over one, ten, a hundred trillion bucks to people who have never once been right about their predictions. You evidently hate “science” if you expect the “science” people to be correct at least one time in a half-century.

And they’re not even good at short-term prognostication. Heck, for several days Hurricane Dorian was supposed to slam head on into Florida and then…it didn’t. The Obamas just bought a $15 million pad on the beach – what’s that say about their faith in “science?” But don’t worry, the guys batting .000 so far will definitely get the temperature in 2119 right if we only just write them a huge check and transform ourselves from citizens to serfs.

That’s another big red flag – have you noticed how “science” always tells us that the only possible response to the climate hullabaloo is to give liberals exactly what they always wanted anyway? How lucky are the leftists to have had an existential problem drop in their laps where the only solution is to give them everything they could not otherwise convince us to give them? What a remarkable coincidence!

And what’s also weird is how nothing that we must do right now no time to debate it’s a crisis think o’ the children in any way inconveniences or calls for sacrifices from our climate crisis-pushing elite. Boy, they really scored with climate change – if they were going to manufacture a crisis in order to get the power and money they craved, how would they do it any differently?

Now, they might claim that they too will have to sacrifice to the Angry Weather Demon, but it’s unclear how. I suppose they might stop flying across the globe to climate finger-wagging festivals in private jets, but call me jaded for thinking that if it’s such a crisis today and they have not stopped doing it yet, they won’t stop jetting about down the road. Oh, but you will. You most definitely will stop flying and driving the vehicles you choose and eating cheeseburgers and using straws that don’t disintegrate into gummy sludge in your Dr. Pepper. But them? Pete Buttigieg explained away his zipping around in Gulfstreams as necessary because it is important for him to be pestering people in Des Moines. Bet you that pretty much everything our betters want to do will turn out to be “important.” And I’ll bet that nothing what you peasants want to do will.

One might think that if stopping carbon was important, you might want to explore nuclear power. But you would think wrong. After all, if there’s plenty of electrical power, the elite loses the political power that comes from divvying up a scarce resource. If they control the power, they control you. Cheap, plentiful power makes you freer, which is a bug, not a feature.

Oh, and those many millions of people in Middle America who directly or indirectly rely on fracking and the rest of the fossil fuel industry? Even bloody-eyed, Gaffe-atronic Joe 3000 wants to shaft you. Better learn to code or something, because your good job is history. Weird how all the sacrifice once again falls on those out in the hinterlands and not on the blue coastal city swells, huh? But you’ll be able to rest easy knowing that our moral superiors in Brooklyn and Alexandria and Santa Monica enjoyed showing you sweaty rubes who’s really the boss by impoverishing you. Because that, and not the weather in a century, is and always has been what the “climate change” hoax is really all about.

If you want to read a vivid account of what happens if the Democrats succeed and manage to enslave us through weather inquisitions or disarming those of us who don’t commit crimes or however, check out my action-packed yet hilarious novels, People’s Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire.

1322,"eport after report has documented the warning President Trump received about the growing threat the new coronavirus posed to the U.S. But Trump remained defiant, reports say, seeking to settle the markets and sustain the three years of economic growth that had underpinned his reelection campaign. Even after recommending social distancing and the closing of the U.S. economy, Trump insisted that the measures to protect human life couldn’t last too long because he did not want to “let the cure be worse than the problem itself.”

This phraseology is all too familiar for anyone who has closely followed the last decade of debate around climate change. “Plans stemming from panic will constrain our economy,” Florida GOP Senator Marco Rubio warned last year, saying we should stop trying to halt climate change and just adapt. “I’m not a scientist. I’m interested in protecting Kentucky’s economy,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2014. “The benefits do not outweigh the costs,” said Paul Ryan, the former Speaker of the House, of climate mitigation measures.

Even a cursory look at science and economics casts doubt on these statements. With both climate change and the coronavirus pandemic, simple economics show that the benefits of early action outweigh the costs. The U.S. would have saved trillions of dollars by acting early. Transitioning the world away from fossil fuels is a gargantuan task that comes with significant costs, but those costs pale in comparison to the tens of trillions of dollars inaction will cost the global economy—not to mention the “known unknowns” that could end up costing a lot more.

For all Trump’s rhetoric about economic growth, many economists have argued when it comes to both climate change and the coronavirus his administration’s attempt to continue growing without due regard for the science at the core of the issues has done more to harm the long-term economic picture than help it. In economic terms, understanding the rationale for acting on climate change and the coronavirus requires only a quick look at a basic concept: the cost-benefit analysis.

A cost-benefit analysis requires many complex calculations and assumptions, but at its core it’s as simple as it sounds. Since the mid-20th century, economists have assigned a monetary value to the various costs and benefits of a particular policy action to determine whether it’s worth pursuing.

The practice quickly took hold for environmental policymakers, and became a key tool at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). To create new regulations, the agency regularly compares the environmental benefits with the costs of inaction and implementation. Unsurprisingly, these calculations are often subject to extensive dispute. After all, how do you assign value to say, clean drinking water, let alone a human life? Even more complicated with climate change, how do you determine the value of a benefit that won’t be realized for years or decades into the future?

Economists have debated those questions for years, fighting over the wonky details, but the Trump Administration has sought to reset that debate. To justify nixing the Clean Power Plan, a key Obama-era climate policy, the Trump EPA argued that the agency shouldn’t consider the health benefits of clean air as part of rule focused on climate change, for example. The administration also undermined a metric that measures the cost of emitting carbon dioxide known as “the social cost of carbon,” giving less consideration to the effects of climate change on future generations and the rest of the world. The Obama administration calculated the social cost of carbon to be around $50 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted; the Trump administration says it’s as low as $1.

Of course, the coronavirus pandemic has come about too quickly to expect the administration to have made a formal calculation of the cost of addressing it. But a University of Chicago economist used a rough cost-benefit analysis to estimate that the U.S. should be willing to spend $65 trillion on lockdowns to prevent deaths. That’s equivalent to roughly three years of U.S. economic output. “COVID-19 has prompted a slew of benefit-cost analyses,” writes Gernot Wagner, an economist at New York University, in a Bloomberg column. “The verdict in virtually all of them is clear: shutting down the economy to contain the spread of the virus is worth the costs.”

The Trump administration’s reopening plans generally align with the recommendations of public health officials. Nonetheless, Trump’s rhetoric—endorsing protests to “liberate” states and promising to have the country back to normal soon—certainly seems to undervalue the benefits of locking down.

Calculating the monetary value of addressing climate change is similarly complicated, but the evidence is firmly on the side of urgent action. If handled right, policies to reduce emissions will actually deliver huge economic benefits, from clean air to green jobs. At the same time, the costs of inaction are so steep, to the point that economists struggle to account for them.

One problem in getting policies enacted based on cost-benefit analyses is that many smart people working on climate prefer not to discuss climate change in terms of economics. This is understandable. Protecting human life and health—not to mention all the other life on the planet—is about far more than dollars and cents. And the cost of climate change, while measuring in the trillions of dollars, doesn’t accurately capture the broad cultural and societal disruption the phenomenon is likely to cause.

But, for those who are skeptical of cost-benefit analyses, it’s worth pointing out to the climate action naysayers that even by the measure of jobs, growth and cold hard cash, unmitigated climate change, much like unchecked coronavirus, is a clear loser for everyone.

Just look at the numbers. The National Climate Assessment, a report from more than a dozen federal agencies, suggests that unchecked climate change will cost the U.S. $500 billion annually by the end of the century. Globally, we’re talking about tens of trillions of dollars saved in the next 30 years if we act to keep temperatures from rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, the target outlined in the Paris Agreement, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

“Delayed climate action will cost us vastly more each year in terms of lost lives and livelihoods, crippled businesses, and damaged economies,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said late last month. “The highest cost is the cost of doing nothing.” The rest of the world is starting to get this. Now it’s the U.S.’s turn.

726,"Earlier this month, the United Nations released warnings of the imminent need to tightly control global temperature increase over the next 12 years in order to limit the impacts of global warming.

By now the wide-reaching impacts of global warming are widely known. However, as well as the increased risks of drought, floods and extreme heat, and the environmental catastrophes they entail, a new study has warned of a link between global temperature increase and decreasing workplace productivity.

YU Shuang, XIA Jiangjiang and YAN Zhongwei from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, together with colleagues from China and UK, studied 4,363 responses to a 2016 global online survey into the effect of heat stress on the work productivity losses (WPL). From this, they were able to quantify the effects of heat stress on work productivity in different countries for the year.

As with many impacts of global warming, the effects will be felt most in the developing world. The survey results revealed that the heat-related WPL for the year was 6.6 days for developing countries and 3.5 days for developed countries.

Previous surveys on the impact of rising temperatures on WPL have been conducted, but they mainly focused developed countries, and only included a small sample size. However, in this study, researchers identified regions most vulnerable to heat waves that might have been overlooked in the past, especially the regions such as Central Asia and northern Europe due to relatively low adaptability to heat.



The research looked at the loss of productivity when the increase in global temperature reached 1.5, 2, 3 and 4°C, and found that the estimated heat-related WPL was negatively correlated with the gross domestic product per capita. If the UN target of a global temperature increase of no more than 1.5°C is achieved, WPL will still increase by 9 days in the developed world, and 19 days in the developing world.

If the UN’s previous target of 2°C is reached, this would increase to 12 days in the developed world and 31 in the developing world. In Southeast Asia, the most affected region, the heat-related WPL would be more than two months.

With a clear link between workplace heat conditions and economic performance, reduced work capacity could result in lower economic output for both individual organisations, and in turn countries as a whole.

The financial impacts of high temperatures have already been quantified, with a 2015 Australian study finding that the country loses at least US$6.2bn per year due to reduced productivity caused by heatwaves.

YU Shuang believes that there is an urgent need for improved infrastructure to better deal with the impacts of temperature rise, especially in the developing world:

“Heat waves surely impact more seriously the developing countries in general, but our study quantitatively estimated how much heatwaves would reduce the productivity and identified the most vulnerable regions over the world. Our results call for attention to the need of adaptation to increasing heatwaves by improving protective infrastructure especially for the developing regions in the Belt and Road.”",mainstream
1204,"It was only last week that the massive wildfires that, in January, began tearing through the national park near Australia’s capital city of Canberra were finally declared out. In the intervening weeks they consumed more than 80 percent of the park. This is just one example of the enormous toll taken recently by southeastern Australia’s unprecedented bushfires, which collectively killed more than 30 people, destroyed nearly 6,000 structures and wiped out hundreds of millions of animals.

The flames were fanned by a rare perfect storm of conditions, including strong winds, prolonged drought and scorching temperatures—along with a boost from climate change. Global warming has pushed up the odds of such extreme fires events occurring in southeastern Australia by at least 30 percent—and likely by much more—according to a preprint study released on Wednesday. It is the most thorough analysis to date of the role of climate change in a particular wildfire event. The examination began as the blazes were still scorching forests and blanketing cities in smoke, impacting some of the researchers involved in the work.

The analysis, which has also been submitted to the journal Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, suggests that while events of this magnitude will remain relatively rare in the future, firefighting efforts and other disaster-response systems need to prepare for rising odds or they risk being overwhelmed. “I hope that people will see this as the study that did show there is a link between climate change and the bushfires,” says co-author Geert Jan van Oldenborgh of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.

Climate scientists have increasingly been conducting what are called “extreme event attribution studies” to address the inevitable questions that crop up about the role of climate change in any number of weather extremes, from heat waves to floods. The World Weather Attribution consortium (WWA), a group of researchers who conducted the new study, has pioneered a way to do such analyses immediately after an event—rather than the months or years that early studies took to complete.

Wildfires are particularly tricky for such investigations because myriad ingredients play a role in driving them, including weather, fuel availability and ignition sources. Helping to set the stage for the recent fires were the facts that Australia had its hottest and driest year in 2019 and that large areas had been subject to drought for three years, along with highly conducive fire weather. The new WWA analysis considered the weather and climate aspects but not ignition sources. The researchers examined trends in a risk measure called the Fire Weather Index, which includes factors such as precipitation, temperature, humidity and wind speed. They also looked at temperature and precipitation on their own, over an area of the states of New South Wales and Victoria between the Great Dividing Range mountain system and the coast.

When fires began igniting in the region during the Australian spring, 95 percent of the country had some of the highest fire index values on record, WWA team member Sophie Lewis of the University of New South Wales said during a press conference on Tuesday. There is only about a 3 percent chance of having such extreme values in any given year, the WWA researchers say. But according to their analysis, historical records show that such high fire indices are nearly four times more likely now than they were in 1900. Based on climate models that can compare worlds with and without anthropogenic warming, those indices are currently 30 percent more likely to occur than they were 120 years ago.

The team thinks the main climate driver behind the increased odds of exceptionally high fire indices is temperature. “The hot temperatures just pull the moisture out of the potential fuels,” such as trees, van Oldenborgh says. The historical records indicate the chances of the exceptional heat that gripped the region during the fires are 10 times higher now, compared with the beginning of the 20th century. But the climate models used in the study suggest such events are twice as likely because of climate change.

Van Oldenborgh says the results demonstrate that these models are consistently underestimating the rise in heat extremes with warming—something that the investigators also noticed when looking at heat waves in Europe and that they are now working to understand in an attempt to improve projections of future heat and fire risk.

Unlike the case with temperature, the team could not find a discernable trend in the extreme dryness that contributed to the ferocity and size of the fires. Previous research has shown this dryness was caused by La Niña and other natural climate swings, which are linked to ocean temperatures and influence atmospheric circulation. This season, those phenomena happened to align in a way that brought southeastern Australia weather ripe for encouraging fires.

Taken together, the study’s results show that though “natural variation was very important and will continue to be important in fueling these large fire seasons”—and though such events are likely to remain rare occurrences—climate change is making them “substantially more probable,” says John Abatzoglou, a climate scientist at the University of Idaho. He was not involved in the new analysis but has investigated how climate change has influenced fire risk in the western U.S.

The new paper points to the need for governments and the disaster-response systems they have in place to take these rising risks into consideration, Abatzoglou says. He cites the example of Australia’s largely local and volunteer bushfire-fighting force, which was stretched thin during the recent blazes. Insurance companies are also paying attention to this research to better understand the changing risks, he adds. The study’s authors hope their work will help inform the reckoning over how to respond to climate change happening in Australia in the wake of the fires. “We do the best scientifically thorough study that we can do, and we hope that this is input for the wider discussion,” van Oldenborgh says.",mainstream
431,"At 19, Naomi Seibt is on her way to becoming the voice of climate sceptics. Close to the far right in her home country of Germany, she has also been propelled by the Heartland Institute, an American think tank supported by allies of US President Donald Trump.

Climate sceptics have found their muse: Naomi Seibt, a German woman who denounces “climate alarmism” in videos she posts on her YouTube channel. In December, the Heartland Institute, an American think tank engaged against scientific consensus on climate change, gave Seibt top billing during its one-day forum on “climate reality”, which took place on the margins of COP 25, the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain.

One month later, the institute featured Seibt in a video posted on its own YouTube channel, entitled “Naomi Seibt vs. Greta Thunberg: Whom Should We Trust?”

“Greta Thunberg took the world by storm with her doomsday climate predictions,” reads the video’s description. “Naomi Seibt, a rising star, advocates for proper scientific discourse over climate change. Who seems like the more reasonable advocate to you?”

‘I don’t want you to panic’

The media has cast Seibt as the “anti-Greta”, and it’s difficult to avoid the comparison. The activists are both eloquent and close in age: The Swedish Thunberg is 16, and Seibt is 19. Thunberg warns unceasingly of climate crisis, while Seibt warns against ""climate change alarmism"".

Without denying global warming, a trend which she thinks is overestimated, Seibt questions the impact of human activity on the phenomenon. In the Heartland video, she says that “climate change alarmism, at its very core, is a despicably anti-human ideology”.

She also hopes to reassure the young people who mobilise for the “Fridays for Future” protests initiated by Thunberg. “I would like that young people are not made to fear the future or to believe that the older generations are destroying the planet, that the animals are dying out or that nature is dying,” Seibt said.

Faced with Thunberg’s success, Seibt is inspired by its elements of language and communication. She has altered some of the Swedish activist’s now-famous phrases for her own purposes, transforming, for example, Thunberg’s “I want you to panic”, from the World Economic Forum in January 2019, to an oppositional “I don’t want you to panic. I want you to think.”

However, Seibt doesn’t like being compared to the author of her source material.

“The reason I don’t like the term ‘anti-Greta’ is that it suggests I am an indoctrinated puppet myself,” she told an interviewer.

Freedom of expression, the migrant crisis and the German far right

Seibt claims that, unlike Thunberg, she is not being indoctrinated. She places her fight under the virtuous flag of freedom of expression as against so-called group think, asserting her right to “express scepticism, based on science”.

The German activist says she started “being sceptical” in 2015. “But this had less to do with climate science than with the migrant crisis in Germany.” She claims to be critical of subjects that find consensus in “mainstream media”, such as immigration, feminism, gender theory, socialism, postmodernism and climate change. Issues that are “all linked in a sense and open the way to totalitarianism”.

German media call Seibt a sympathiser of Germany's far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) party, the third-largest political force in Parliament. She insists she’s not part of AfD; however, her first video posted on YouTube is a poem on courage written for a competition that AfD launched in April 2019. Seibt also was applauded at an AfD meeting in Münster in early February.

Last November, Seibt participated in a conference of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), a German think tank whose vice president, Michael Limburg, appeared on AfD’s list for the 2017 legislative elections. It was there that the Heartland Institute, which had hosted conferences with EIKE, first noticed her.

But why would an American think tank show so much interest in a teenage German activist? The Heartland Institute receives backing from influential Republicans, as well as Democrat William Happer, a scientist who served on the White House National Security Council between 2018 and 2019. Happer founded the CO2 Coalition, an organisation to defend the “vital role of CO2 in our environment”, and is known for having compared the “demonization of CO2” to the “demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler”.

According to the Washington Post, the Heartland Institute fears that “Germany’s strong will to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions is contagious”. The Post reported that a Heartland director wrote that Seibt was the “star” of its Climate Reality Forum in Madrid, and a person who would be well-placed to fight German climate policy.

Suspected of being manipulated despite her intentions, Seibt has responded by adopting Thunberg’s cri de coeur at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York City last September. “How dare you?” Seibt asks in a video entitled “Message to the Media”. Time Magazine named Thunberg its 2019 Person of the Year, and her speech at the UN has millions of views on various YouTube channels; Seibt’s video, thus far, has less than 50,000. The comparison between the two activists ends there.

969,"London was brought to a standstill Wednesday morning after militant climate change protesters cause havoc for a third day in a row, climbing and gluing themselves on subway trains, causing road closures and other disruption, leading to an arrest of nearly 300 people in the past 48 hours.

The protesters calling themselves Extinction Rebellion, which were also responsible for a naked protest in the British Parliament earlier this month, are demanding the government to legally commit to reducing net carbon emissions to zero in the next six years and are willing to go to jail for the cause.

Londoners’ morning commute was particularly disrupted after the protesters climbed on top of a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train in East London, prompting shutdown or severe delays on numerous underground lines.

The group has been clashing with police officers and blocking traffic in Central London, including near Parliament, since Monday, resulting in at least 290 arrests, the BBC reported.

The scale of the arrests forced the police to reveal that “contingency plans are in place should custody suites become full.”

In addition to furious Londoners, the methods of the protest were criticized by left-wing London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who said that while he believes climate change must be tackled, he was “extremely concerned” about the disruptions.

“It is absolutely crucial to get more people using public transport, as well as walking and cycling, if we are to tackle this climate emergency - and millions of Londoners depend on the Underground network to get about their daily lives in our city,” he tweeted.

“Targeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change, as well as risking Londoners' safety and I'd implore anyone considering doing so to think again.”

The militant protesters also glued their hands to the train carriages as they touted their success in causing mayhem in the capital, prompting the authorities to turn off the transportation system’s public Wi-Fi to stop them from coordinating actions, the Daily Mail reported.

Some commuters said the protest was “ridiculous” because it only forced commuters to use their cars rather than using the considerably more environmentally-friendly subway.

Transport disruptions reportedly affected 500,000 people over the last few days, while retailers located on the high street say they lost about $12 million in sales in the last two days due to the protests.

Farhana Yamin, a protester who was arrested on Tuesday, apologized to Londoners on BBC Radio 4 but insisted that such actions are justified.

“I totally want to apologize to people using public transport. But at the same time we need to take actions that are disruptive so everyone understands the dangers we're facing right now,” she said.

“I'm not someone who goes out on to the streets and disrupts and gets arrested for no reason at all. But I feel people should understand that we are at a critical moment in our humanity's history.”",mainstream

763,"A hydrocarbon is an organic chemical compound composed exclusively of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Hydrocarbons are naturally-occurring compounds and form the basis of crude oil, natural gas, coal, and other important energy sources.

Hydrocarbons are highly combustible and produce carbon dioxide, water, and heat when they are burned. Therefore, hydrocarbons are highly effective as a source of fuel.

Hydrocarbons occur naturally throughout the world, originating from plant and animal fossils that have been formed by the forces of temperature and weight over millennia. They are mostly found deep underground, in porous rock formations (such as sandstone, limestone, and shale). Porous rock formations are often found in large bodies of water, so there is an immense quantity of hydrocarbons trapped deep beneath the oceans. Oil and natural gas exploration companies use advanced engineering techniques to identify these potential reservoirs and pull their resources to the surface for human use. Examples of such technologies include offshore oil platforms, directional drilling, and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques.

Hydrocarbons are very important for the modern economy. Globally, hydrocarbons are responsible for roughly 85% of energy consumption. This figure may actually understate the role of hydrocarbons in the economy by a significant margin because they are used in a wide range of applications aside from their use as a source of energy. For example, refined petroleum has been used to produce myriad derivative materials that play critical roles in the global economy, such as plastics, solvents, and lubricants.

Different techniques are used to extract hydrocarbons, depending on the type and location of the reserve. For example, hydraulic fracturing—better known as “fracking”—is used to extract natural gas from shale rock by using pressurized fracking fluid to create fissures through which the gas can escape to the surface. Mining is used to access oil sands, which are unconventional deposits of crude oil that are heavily intermixed with sand and sandstone.

Unfortunately, it is now understood that there is a serious environmental cost to using hydrocarbons as a primary source of energy. Greenhouse gasses released during the combustion of hydrocarbons are contributing to climate change. The process of oil and gas extraction can damage the surface environment and surrounding groundwater of the extraction site.

Many economists argue that hydrocarbon energy production involves substantial negative externalities that are not sufficiently represented in the market price of oil and gas. In fact, considering the mounting cost of climate-change-related phenomena, many argue that these externalities significantly outweigh any cost savings associated with hydrocarbons.

To address these concerns, there is a growing movement toward the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, nuclear, wind, and geothermal power. Alongside innovations in battery technology and “smart grid” infrastructure, these new energy alternatives may play a significantly larger role in global energy production in the years and decades ahead.",mainstream
653,"Want to save the planet, but can’t overcome your addiction to steak and air travel? NBC has put out a call for “climate confessions,” allowing viewers to unburden themselves of their first-world problems anonymously.

Anyone concerned about their failure to “do their part” in “preventing climate change” can confess their sins to NBC in one of six categories: plastics, meat, energy, transportation, paper and food waste. Previous visitors’ climate “sins” are posted anonymously, in case you need inspiration or can’t remember how you last violated the trust of Mother Nature.

But NBC’s audience doesn’t seem to be falling for it. “I run my AC 24/7. I’m not going to sweat to appease this climate religion,” reads one confession posted on the site. “I think the climate has always been changing, and I’m not going to stop eating meat because of cult-like manipulation by the left,” reads another.

As criticism of the green movement increasingly points out its cultish aspects, NBC’s online confessional is providing some quality ammunition. But it’s not the only element of the green movement that has religious underpinnings.

Carbon offsets are little more than a 21st century version of the papal “indulgences” purchased by wealthy sinners to offset their evil deeds and grant them entry into heaven.

The trend toward consuming flavorless sludge like Soylent and insect-based foods to save the planet by punishing one’s own tastebuds is reminiscent of those medieval religious devotees who wore hair shirts to mortify their flesh.

With the movement’s Joan of Arc Greta Thunberg in the lead – seriously, mainstream publications are unironically calling her Joan of Arc – children worldwide are mounting what some have termed a crusade, demanding their parents fix the planet lest the world end before they have a chance to grow old.

Those parents – and everyone else in their generation – are socially forbidden to criticize Thunberg because of her age and mental disorder, and NBC’s climate confessional seems to be a peace offering, or a gateway drug: if you can’t beat them, join them. “Confessions” have a limit of 130 characters – you don’t have to tell your life story – just admit it, say you’ve been bad, and say 40 Hail Gretas.

Not a joke: Church of Sweden to Ring Bells in Celebration of Greta Thunberg, Proclaiming Her Jesus’ Successor

In New York, Mayor Bill deBlasio has officially excused kids from school next Friday, so long as they participate in the climate strike. Thunberg has already chastised Congress for refusing to take “meaningful action,” as if that was something Congress did on any other issue.

“Flygskam” (flying shame) could catch on among the 40-plus percent of Americans who can’t afford to take vacations, but more likely they will continue to save up for an airborne getaway. For those who can afford to fret over the recyclability of their straws, however, a promising new religion has landed on US shores in a racing yacht owned by the royal family of Monaco.

And like the medieval church, the green movement has a major sideline in getting rich. We Don’t Have Time, the tech company that made Thunberg a star, has attracted hundreds of investors by launching a “social network for climate action” that will essentially evaluate businesses based on the quality of their greenwashing PR.",conspiracy

NEW YORK (AP) — New York’s attorney general is accusing Exxon Mobil of lying to investors about how profitable the company will remain as governments impose stricter regulations to combat global warming.

The lawsuit, which is set to go to trial Tuesday, claims the Texas energy giant kept two sets of books — one accounting for climate change regulations and the other underestimating the costs — to make the company appear more valuable to investors.

Exxon denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated, and said the company looks forward to being exonerated in court.

At stake is how much value investors will still see in oil and gas companies once the impact of climate change — and the stepped-up efforts to curb it — become more apparent.

“If companies like Exxon accurately account for the necessary degree of regulation to prevent even more dangerous global warming from happening, it will make less and less sense to continue to invest in developing fossil fuel projects,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.

While there are hundreds of lawsuits filed against companies about climate change, this is one of the first to go to trial, according to the Sabin Center.

At the heart of the case is a question about whether Exxon was downplaying the impact regulations may pose on its ability to make money in the future.

The complaint says that in order to account for future climate change regulations, Exxon told the public it was applying an estimated cost — or “proxy cost” — of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to its investment decisions. It also said it would apply the proxy cost when it evaluates the value of its assets and estimates future demand for oil and gas.

But the complaint says that instead, Exxon applied lower or no proxy costs for years when making investment decisions or assessing its oil and gas reserves. As a result, the company may have been exposed to far greater risk from climate change regulations than investors were led to believe, the complaint said. An expert witness for the state estimated potential damages to shareholders of $476 million to $1.6 billion.

The state also claims Exxon inaccurately concluded that it faced little risk associated with a “two degrees scenario,” in which the consumption of fossil fuels was severely curtailed to limit global temperature increases to below two degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. The complaint says Exxon claimed its oil and gas reserves face little risk of becoming too expensive to operate and that the company would be able to profitably exploit those assets well into the future.

Exxon said that because there isn’t a uniform, globally accepted cost of carbon, the company uses two distinct metrics to account for the impact of existing and potential climate-related regulations. The first, a “proxy cost,” reflects climate policies that could reduce demand for oil and natural gas globally, Exxon said in an emailed statement. The other, a greenhouse gas cost, reflects actual costs that could be imposed on emissions of oil and gas projects as a result of a specific jurisdiction’s laws. Exxon takes into account both types of costs to make sound business decisions and meet its responsibilities to shareholders, the company said.

“The New York Attorney General’s case is misleading and deliberately misrepresents a process we use to ensure company investments take into account the impact of current and potential climate-related regulations,” the company said in a statement.

The New York Attorney General’s office declined to elaborate beyond the documents it filed for the case.

The securities fraud case does not accuse Exxon Mobil of playing a role in accelerating climate change but focuses on whether the company misled investors.

“The notion that the company can continue to pump oil and gas with abandon while the climate crisis causes ever greater human suffering and harm to communities across the globe is a destructive fantasy,” said Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family Fund, which has funded research investigating what Exxon and other oil companies knew about climate science. “This case will focus on one element of Exxon’s alleged deception — whether the company misinformed investors about the risks climate change poses to the value of its oil and gas assets. If the state wins, Big Oil will be on notice that a business-as-usual approach to the extraction of fossil fuels is an increasingly fraught enterprise.”",mainstream
640,"Hurricanes are getting stronger as the world gets warmer, according to a new analysis.

Studying how hurricanes have changed over time is difficult. The tools scientists use to study them change constantly and. measurements made with one instrument can't be compared easily to measurements made with another. So though research has suggested the warming world would produce wilder and stronger hurricanes, it's been difficult to say that with certainty. Until now, the data just hasn't been complete enough.. A new paper, published online May 18 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, aims to change that — studying a period of 39 years, between 1979 and 2017. Looking at the full four-decade span and normalizing their data in a certain way, the researchers found a clear trend: Storms are getting stronger in general, and major tropical cyclones are coming more often.

The 39-year period the researchers studied covers an era when climate change dramatically accelerated, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports. The world has warmed significantly in every year of those 39, and the 39 years include eight of the 10 warmest ever recorded ( 2018 and 2019 also make the warmest-years list but were too recent for this study, and the 2020 season isn't over yet).

Related: How strong can a hurricane get?

""The main hurdle we have for finding trends is that the data are collected using the best technology at the time,"" James Kossin, a NOAA scientist and University of Wisconsin-Madison professor, said in a statement. ""Every year the data are a bit different than last year, each new satellite has new tools and captures data in different ways, so in the end we have a patchwork quilt of all the satellite data that have been woven together.""

In order to create a consistent record to work with, the researchers sanded the edges off their newer, sharper tropical cyclone images to fit an older standard: Images where each pixel represents an area 5 miles by 5 miles (8 by 8 kilometers), taken every three hours. They also tossed out images from newer satellites that provide views of storms from angles not available in 1998. That left them with an extensive dataset of about 225,000 similar-quality images of about 4,000 global tropical cyclones stretching back to the disco era.

Meteorologists have long used images of tropical cyclones to estimate their wind intensities, measured in kilotons. And that's what the researchers did here, finding that the chances of any given tropical cyclone becoming a hurricane (hitting 65 knots) have gone up. Normally, hurricanes are defined as storms with winds of at least 74 mph (119 km/h). Winds of that speed emerge around the 65-knot mark. And the odds of major hurricanes (100-knot storms) have gone up by about 15% — with most of that increase happening in the last 19 years of the 39-year study period.

Right now, other possibilities haven't been completely ruled out. This paper on its own doesn't rule out the idea that the uptick in hurricanes isn't the result of some perfect coincidence of other trends, the researchers wrote. But it shows the uptick is happening, precisely during the period of greatest warming, and precisely as the models of how that warming would impact tropical cyclones predicted. The balance of evidence — models and real-world observations — points strongly toward the idea that tropical cyclones ""have become substantially stronger, and that there is a likely human fingerprint on this increase,"" the researchers wrote in the study.

The trend isn't obvious, the researchers wrote. There are regions like the North Pacific, where cyclones haven't gotten stronger — likely because climate change has also moved their average storm tracks northward, to cooler regions with less ocean energy to feed them. And the worldwide average trend toward more powerful storms is complicated by other factors — cycles in the Atlantic Ocean that would have tended to make these storms more intense in recent decades anyway. This paper doesn't fully disentangle local trends like those from global warming effects, the researchers wrote. But it does establish with 95% confidence that tropical cyclones have gotten significantly stronger in the era of most intense climate change, leading to more tropical cyclones becoming hurricanes, and more hurricanes becoming ""major hurricanes.""

530,"Singapore - On 13 March, Wong J-min skipped school and headed to a glass-walled tower at the Harbourfront complex on Singapore's west coast.

While her peers sat in their classrooms, the 18-year-old posed for a series of photos before the building housing ExxonMobil's Singapore office, holding up messages scrawled on pieces of paper that read, ""PLANET OVER PROFIT"", ""SCHOOL STRIKE 4 CLIMATE"", and the tongue-in-cheek ""ExxonMobil KILLS KITTENS & PUPPIES"".
• Greta Thunberg to the UN: 'How dare you?'
• 'No Planet B: Thousands around the world join school climate strike

The photos were shared on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, but while they fuelled some interest, did not go viral.

Wong's small action signalled a fledging Singapore chapter of Fridays for Future - a global school strike movement founded by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg - but just over a week later, Wong found herself summoned for questioning by the police, and her phone was confiscated.

Singapore is a low-lying island that will be heavily affected by rising temperatures and sea levels caused by climate change. Yet much of its economy is also built on the fossil fuels that have been pinpointed as a major perpetrator of the crisis.

According to the country's Economic Development Board, the energy and chemicals industry contributed S$81 billion to Singapore's 2015 output - almost a third of its entire manufacturing output.

""Youth feel that in spite of all that has been announced - various legislation such as the Energy Conservation Act and measures such as the carbon tax - more needs to be done,"" said Melissa Low, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute.

Wong's signs took aim at the petrochemical industry and its presence in Singapore.

Members of the world's largest oil and gas companies, such as Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil, all have a significant presence on Jurong Island, one of the world's largest petrochemical hubs off the southwest coast of Singapore's main island.

ExxonMobil, already one of the largest foreign investors in Singapore, recently held a virtual foundation-laying ceremony for the expansion of its refining and petrochemical complex.

She is not the only young Singaporean speaking out against fossil fuels, despite laws that make protest difficult.

In 2017, a group of students at Yale-NUS College launched a campaign to push the institution to divest from coal, oil and gas. Other initiatives, such as LepakInSG, organise and list activities that provide public education. In September last year, more than 1,700 Singaporeans turned up for the country's first ever climate rally, organised by the new youth-led SG Climate Rally group.

On 22 March, a photo of 20-year-old Nguyen Nhat Minh holding up a placard in public saying ""SG IS BETTER THAN OIL @fridays4futuresg"" was posted on Fridays for Future Singapore's Instagram account.

Nguyen says that he, like Wong, only posed for the picture before leaving.

But he has also been questioned by the police. As part of the investigation, he was escorted from the police station back to his home, where his laptop and mobile phone were seized, and officers dug through the dumpster outside his home to retrieve his cardboard sign.

The duo also says that they were ""strongly advised"" by the police to take down the Fridays for Future Singapore website and social media accounts. The website has been removed, while the Twitter and Instagram accounts have been made private.

If convicted of illegal assembly, the maximum sentence is a fine of up to 5,000 Singapore dollars (US$3,500).

Under Singapore's public order laws, there is only one park in Singapore where residents are allowed to participate in public assemblies without a permit, and even a solo protest is outlawed if the police have not first given their permission.

In 2018, performance artist Seelan Palay spent two weeks in prison in lieu of a fine after a performance - which involved walking with a mirror out of the park to Singapore's parliament building - was deemed an illegal procession.

The Singapore Police Force declined to comment for this story.

Faced with dire warnings of the impact of climate change, Wong feels like the Singapore government needs to move away from fossil fuels sooner rather than later, even though she acknowledges the economic cost.

""To me, as a young person, I think it's a trade-off that's worth it, because I feel like ... [do] you want the economy to die, or [do] you want me to die?"" she told Al Jazeera.

Divesting is easier said than done. As Low points out, the energy and chemicals sector is not only an important contributor to Singapore's economy, it also provides energy security in a country with no natural energy resources of its own.

Singapore is already looking to decarbonise the energy and chemicals sector as much as possible, Low wrote in an email to Al Jazeera.

""Even if Singapore were to completely rid itself of this sector, the question of moving away from fossil fuels and divestment is not so simple, as there's always the risk of carbon leakage where the carbon emission simply goes elsewhere,"" she said.

Wong and Nguyen's run-in with the authorities has caused them strife at home, too.

Wong, who is preparing for her A-Level exams this year, says her father worries the investigation might hurt her future: ""It's not his fault because I guess he's scared, because he's never really had trouble with the police before.""

Nguyen is facing a similar situation. ""[My father] went through the whole speech about his Vietnamese immigrant upbringing and how he worked his way to Singapore and … how I'm basically just throwing it all away,"" he said.

This experience is familiar to many young Singaporeans venturing into activism. Kristian-Marc James Paul, a member of SG Climate Rally, says that many members have had to ""constantly negotiate and navigate our parents' fear for our safety"".

""Our parents have seen how Singaporeans, time and time again, have been punished for speaking up and they don't want that to happen to us.""

That said, Paul said that some parents are supportive of their children's efforts, acknowledging that their offspring are more motivated and courageous than they have been.

Police attention and parental disapproval have not deterred Nguyen, who says that he took the risk because ""ultimately what happens to me isn't as bad as what would happen to other people if we just keep going business as usual"".

Nor is he concerned about any potential threat to his future prospects.

""[Maybe] I make less money, okay … but there are people out there who will not have houses, like their islands will literally be underwater, they won't have anything to eat.""

Although the government announced in February that Singapore will aim to halve its peak 2030 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a view to achieving net zero emissions some time in the second half of the century, climate activists are not satisfied.

SG Climate Rally pointed out that Singapore's targets fall short of the recommendation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

Since the September event, SG Climate Rally has teamed up with another group, Speak for Climate, to launch Greenwatch, a campaign that has already produced a policy brief on climate and intends to score political party manifestos according to their proposals on how to tackle climate change.

""This country focuses a lot on 'bread-and-butter' issues and one of the main criticisms we get is that the climate crisis is not a 'bread-and-butter' issue,"" said Paul.

""We hope that Greenwatch will show Singaporeans that the climate crisis is indeed such an issue because it intersects with so many other concerns Singaporeans have, whether it's cost of living, healthcare services or social inequality.""

Wong and Nguyen have been keeping an eye on social media, trying to gauge the level of support for them. They say the reaction has been fairly polarised: while some have been pleasantly surprised by the emergence of Fridays for Future in Singapore, other commenters have belittled their activism.

""One common criticism I get is, 'Why should adults listen to children?'"" Nguyen said.

""[But] no one needs to listen to us; there have been researchers [calling for action on climate change] for decades. And if we're the first people to tell someone about it, that says more about them than it does about us.""",mainstream
200,"A school in Sweden is going completely vegetarian in an effort to positively impact the climate, according to reports.

The Gitarren Preschool in Umeå is testing the new policy during a trial period with a plan to implement it permanently, making it the first school in the municipality to pursue the radical approach.

All food served at the school will be totally meatless, and children will not have a choice to opt out of the program.

“This means that breakfast, lunch and snacks will be completely vegetarian,” Fria Tider reports. “And anyone who wants meat will not even be able to apply for it. No exceptions are made - everyone must eat vegetarian.”

Teachers claim parents and children are very excited and only positive feedback has been received by the school.

""There have only been positive reactions and many are grateful,"" teacher Markus Sandström told SVT. ""We believe and hope that this can become permanent. So this is the idea, but it felt a bit drastic to go all out with it right away. We must evaluate properly first.""

""We want to be clear that there is nothing political about this. This is something we do because we believe it has a positive climate impact.""

721,"Jane Fonda is an American actress best known for her acting career, political activism and aerobic-exercise videos. The daughter of acclaimed actor Henry Fonda, the actress has won two Oscars.

Born Lady Jayne Seymour Fonda on December 21, 1937, in New York City, Jane Fonda has enjoyed a tremendous career as an actress. She comes from a Hollywood dynasty of sorts. Her father Henry was one of the top actors of the 20th century. Her brother Peter and her niece Bridget have also had their share of success on the big screen. Fonda faced some challenges growing up. Her father could be cold and distant. Her mother, socialite Frances Seymour Brokaw, committed suicide when Fonda was 12 years old. Not long after her mother's death, Fonda developed an eating disorder, which she struggled with for years. She attended boarding school and then went to Vassar College. Leaving college, Fonda went to Paris to study art. Fonda returned to New York and did a bit of modeling for a time. Before long, she decided to follow in her father's footsteps. In 1954, she co-starred with her father in a production of The Country Girl. Fonda began to study her craft with Lee Strasberg at the famed Actors Studio a few years later. Fonda's career seemed to really take off in 1960. She made her film debut in Tall Story (1960) with Anthony Perkins. On Broadway, Fonda netted a Tony Award nomination for There Was a Little Girl. She continued to juggle theatrical and film work over the next few years. Working with director George Cukor, Fonda starred in the romantic comedy The Chapman Report (1962). She shared the Broadway stage with Celeste Holm in Invitation to a March and Dyan Cannon in The Fun Couple around this time. In the late 1960s, Fonda recreated herself as a type of sex kitten under the direction of her French filmmaker husband Roger Vadim. This new look was most evident in the 1968 science fiction tale Barbarella. She soon shed this image for more serious dramatic roles. She scored her first Academy Award nomination for 1969's They Shoot Horses, Don't They? Two years later, Fonda took home her first Academy Award for her work on Alan J. Pakula's thriller Klute, which co-starred Donald Sutherland.

On the big screen, Fonda continued to deliver strong performances. She starred as playwright Lillian Hellman in Julia (1977) with Vanessa Redgrave. The following year, Fonda won her second Academy Award for the Vietnam War drama Coming Home with Jon Voight. She also starred in the hit thriller The China Syndrome (1979) with Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas around this time. Another significant role for Fonda came a few years later. She co-starred with her father Henry in On Golden Pond (1982). The film explores the dynamics of a family during a visit to their summer home. Art mirrored life in this case, with Fonda playing daughter to her real-life father. Katharine Hepburn also starred as Fonda's mother. The film gave her father his first and only Academy Award win as Best Actor. Around this time, Fonda also found herself spearheading a national health craze. She launched an immensely successful series of aerobic-exercise videos.

In 2005, Fonda made a dramatic return to the public eye. She appeared in her first film in almost 15 years with Monster-in-Law, which also starred Jennifer Lopez and Michael Vartan. That same year, Fonda published an autobiography, My Life So Far. More film roles followed, including playing the title character in the 2007 film Georgia Rule with Lindsay Lohan. Working on the small screen, Fonda landed a recurring role on the media-focused dramatic series The Newsroom in 2012. She also played former First Lady Nancy Reagan in the 2013 film The Butler. The following year, Fonda played the matriarch in the family dramatic comedy This Is Where I Leave You with Jason Bateman and Tina Fey. In 2015, Fonda teamed up with longtime friend Lily Tomlin for the series Grace and Frankie. The show looks at two women who work to rebuild their lives after their husbands fall in love with each other and leave them. Martin Sheen plays Fonda's husband, Robert, and Sam Waterston plays Tomlin's husband, Sol. That year Fonda also delivered a standout performance alongside Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel in Youth, earning a Golden Globe nomination for Supporting Actress. In addition to her acting, Fonda became an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War. She traveled to North Vietnam in 1972 — a visit that caused an uproar back at home. Many were particularly upset by Fonda's decision to pose for photos while sitting on an antiaircraft gun, one used to shoot at American troops. She was given the nickname ""Hanoi Jane"" and seen as a traitor for her support of the North Vietnamese. Fonda also fought for social causes, serving as a spokesperson on issues of civil rights and women's rights. Rededicating herself to activism, Fonda moved to Washington, D.C., in September 2019 to embark on a series of public protests to highlight the urgency of climate change. She was arrested multiple times as a result, often alongside famous friends like Waterston, Ted Danson and Catherine Keener. Fonda has been married three times — all of these unions ended in divorce. Her marriage to filmmaker Roger Vadim lasted from 1965 to 1973, and they had a daughter named Vanessa together. Then she married activist and politician Tom Hayden in 1973. They welcomed their son Troy Garity that same year. When Troy was a teenager, Fonda also unofficially adopted a young African-American girl named Mary Williams. Williams later wrote about her life with Fonda in the 2013 memoir The Lost Daughter. After divorcing Hayden in 1990, Fonda soon found love with media mogul Ted Turner. Married in 1991, the pair stayed together for a decade. The couple divorced in 2001, reportedly over Fonda's newfound Christian faith. She went on to date music producer Richard Perry for nearly a decade, until they split in 2017.",mainstream
1093,"Yes, illegal immigrants are bringing a cesspool of dangerous infectious diseases into America, and the CDC is doing nothing about it

If you are a parent who chooses not to vaccinate your children because of the fact that vaccines have never truly been proven safe or effective, then the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says you are putting public health at risk. But if you are a child-trafficker bringing illegal aliens infected with mystery diseases across the southern border, then you are suddenly a champion for human rights, and a hero for social justice.

This is the message being transmitted to the public by the CDC, which refuses to acknowledge that there might be risks involved with allowing illegal immigrants to continue to pour across the southern border largely unabated, as they bring with them unknown illnesses that require them to be quarantined in order to prevent serious disease outbreaks.

One would think that, based on how aggressively the CDC uses political rhetoric to demonize “anti-vaxxers,” that it would at least admit to the fact that it is probably not a good idea to foment open borders as a matter of official policy. But the CDC is remaining completely silent about this issue, even as young children are turning up not only disease-infected, but also sexually-violated in heinous ways.

According to reports, one little illegal girl, just 10 years of age, was apprehended at the border and found to have 20 different types of semen inside her body, indicating that she had been repeatedly raped by pedophiles. Other young children are turning up with highly-contagious diseases like mumps which, just like measles, is one of the conditions that the mainstream media routinely uses as an excuse to push for mandatory vaccination laws.

“There were some Congolese people caught crossing the border, it was suspected they had Ebola,” medical professionals working at the border have reportedly told Big League Politics. “In one facility there are three patients being held because they don’t know what they have. The CDC have been here to assess them. They are isolated, they only have certain specialists who can see them.”

Illegal immigrants are free to spread deadly diseases to Americans because “no human is illegal,” but when Americans don’t vaccinate their children in California or New York, they instantly become illegal

As it turns out, the U.S. government has been importing thousands of illegal immigrants from the Congo through San Antonio, Texas, and possibly elsewhere, many of whom are also sick, and who might be spreading Ebola to unwitting Americans.

But those who consume only mainstream news might not know about this, at least to the same degree that they “know” about measles supposedly “making a comeback” because some American parents choose not to vaccinate their children.

Somehow, it is completely okay to bring in unlimited numbers of illegal aliens, many of whom are carrying with them deadly diseases, because “no human is illegal.” But when it comes to American citizens making informed medical choices for themselves and their children, suddenly these humans are now illegal in places like California and New York, which are aggressively trying to stamp out exemption clauses for forced vaccination.

This is the sad state of America in 2019, where illegally entering the country and spreading disease is a “virtue,” but rejecting mandatory vaccination as a citizen is quickly becoming “illegal.” In this same America, the southern border is to remain wide open for illegal invaders, even as digital borders are being erected to keep conservatives and Christians from entering the conversation with their free speech.

107,"Once dismissed as a “novel perspective,” the right to a healthy environment is now considered legally established around the world, he says. It is enshrined in the constitutions of more than 100 nations and has been incorporated in legislation, treaties or in other documents of at least 155 nations. Of the court cases based on a constitutional right to a healthy environment, the majority are winning. And, in the cases brought by young people, courts are receptive to recognising that right for future generations.

“What you see in this rising tide, led by children—who have the greatest stake—of people saying to their governments: ‘You have failed. We have rights and you need to abide by and protect those rights,’” says Carroll Muffett, president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law, based in Washington and Geneva.

The seven-year-old’s case in Pakistan builds on the successful outcome of an earlier lawsuit filed by a farmer who claimed Pakistan’s failure to carry out its climate commitments cost him his livelihood. The court found that “the delay and lethargy of the State in implementing [climate policy] offend the fundamental rights of citizens.” The court also ordered the creation of a Climate Change Commission to monitor the government’s progress.

The Netherlands case eventually involved almost 900 Dutch citizen plaintiffs from multiple generations. In 2015 the judges swiftly and overwhelmingly rejected the government’s claim that near-term climate action would be too expensive. The court-ordered remedy requires the government, within a year, to make nearly twice the carbon emission cuts made since 1990. To meet that target, the government has said it would shut down a coal-fired power plant in Amsterdam, slated for closure at the end of 2024, by the end of this year. Meanwhile it has appealed the decision to the Dutch supreme court.

The Dutch case has became the model for similarly fashioned lawsuits in Belgium, Ireland, and Canada, and it has inspired other climate cases in countries as far flung as Uganda, New Zealand, Australia, and Norway. The Colombia case has had a similar impact. When the youths there won their case, Boyd says, “Let me tell you, there were lawyers in 100 other countries saying: how can we emulate that decision? We’ve never had such a globally connected system.”

The exception may be the case in the United States, where judges are traditionally immune from influence from international cases. Juliana v. United States, named for lead plaintiff Kelsey Juliana, now a 23-year-old University of Oregon student, was filed against the Obama administration in 2015, around the same time the Netherlands case was decided. It’s being closely watched for the possibility that it may write new precedents if it survives.

If some see climate litigation as the last chance to slow global warming, critics argue that turning policy and lawmaking over to judges is misguided and will accomplish little more than to spawn the very flood of litigation that advocates predict.

Michael Burger, executive director and CEO of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University Law School in New York, says the swelling wave of lawsuits should surprise no one, given the lumbering pace of government action. At the moment, the center is tracking 1,039 cases ongoing in the United States and 283 in other countries. The majority of them, unlike the youth cases, involve enforcing existing environmental regulations and law.

“People are taking to the courts because governments are falling short and when you have nowhere else to go, you go to court,” he says.

There are other drawbacks to litigation. Lawsuits move slowly too. The Belgian case stalled for three years over arguments about whether to proceed in Dutch or French; the parties finally agreed on French. Court-ordered solutions can be ineffective or unenforceable.

The decision last year in Colombia, for example, is considered one of the most progressive and powerful in the region. But the court-ordered plan to curb deforestation has so far generated more publicity than government action, says Cesar Rodrigues-Garavito, the plaintiffs' lawyer and founder of Dejusticia, a Colombian human rights group. He has called for his clients to mobilize to prod the government to move ahead.

Most of the countries with constitutional protections of environmental rights are developing nations with newer constitutions, Boyd says. Many are still emerging from the legacies of colonialism or military dictatorship and struggling to deliver basic services to their citizens. Those factors increase the odds against a court ordering a climate remedy, say, that is actually enforced.

Even in Norway, where the constitution, which dates to 1814, is the world’s second-oldest after that of the United States, protected rights don’t always win the day. Norway’s constitution clearly details the right to a healthy environment and that it be “safeguarded for future generations.”

Yet a Norway court dismissed efforts by Nordic youth and two non-governmental organizations to prevent the government from granting licenses for oil and gas exploration in the Barents Sea. The plaintiffs had argued that the licenses would violate Norway’s commitment under the Paris climate agreement as well as the Norwegian constitution. Although the court agreed that the right to a healthy environment is a claimable right, it concluded that the licenses would not violate it.

“Sometimes judges make bad decisions. They said this can’t be a violation of Norway’s right to a healthy environment because the oil will be exported,” Boyd says. “This case has a chance on appeal, which will be heard this fall.”

The constitutional question is at the center of the U.S. case. Government lawyers for both the Obama and Trump administrations have argued from the start that no such constitutional right exists, and the Trump administration has repeatedly tried to have the case thrown out of court.

The United States is one of 38 UN member states lacking expressly stated constitutional protections to a healthy environment. The youths say such language is not necessary for courts to find in their favour. They claim the federal government’s promotion of the production of fossil fuels and indifference to the risks posed by greenhouse gas emissions have created a “dangerous destabilising climate system” that threatens their rights to life, liberty and property, which are contained in the Constitution. U.S. District Court Judge Anne Aiken agreed with their claim and ordered the case to be tried.

Recognizing environmental rights in that context would elevate the case into the realm of historic cases, including Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 decision that declared segregation of public schools unconstitutional, and Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that recognized a constitutional right to access to abortion.

In arguments before a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals earlier in June, Jeffrey Clark, a U.S. assistant attorney general, called the lawsuit a “dagger at the separation of powers.”

He added: “This is a suit that is designed to circumvent a whole bunch of statutes.”

In an animated, hour-long hearing, the three-judge panel conveyed their skepticism to both Clark and Julia Olson, the youths’ lead attorney.

“Look, you’re arguing for us to break new ground,” Judge Andrew Hurwitz told Olson. “I’m sympathetic to the problems you point out. But you shouldn’t say this is an ordinary suit… You’re asking us to do a lot of new stuff.”",mainstream
1279,"Rex Tillerson rose through the ranks of ExxonMobil to become its CEO and chairman in 2006. He served as the 69th U.S. secretary of state from February 2017 to March 2018.

Rex Wayne Tillerson (b. March 23, 1952) was sworn in as the 69th secretary of state for the United States on February 1, 2017, under President Donald J. Trump. His tenure was marked by clashes with the Trump administration, leading to his dismissal from the post on March 13, 2018. Tillerson previously served as CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil from 2006 to 2016. His entire career was spent at this company, making him the first secretary of state with no prior experience in the government or military.

Tillerson rose from modest beginnings to accumulate an estimated $300 million fortune during his career. At the end of 2016 he left ExxonMobil with a retirement package of $180 million; the equivalent cash value of his unpaid stock was placed into an independent trust so as to avoid conflicts of interest.

Among the pressing issues Tillerson had to cope with in his tenure as secretary of state were a nuclear-armed North Korea, trade concerns with China and questions about Iran's compliance with an agreement to freeze its nuclear program. Yet he faced all of these issues with a smaller diplomatic corps than his predecessors.

When Tillerson took the reins, he wanted to ""redesign"" the State Department. His goal was to eliminate personnel overlaps and bureaucratic deadwood, something many in the department initially welcomed. However, critics contended that U.S. diplomacy was being undermined, in large part due to a loss of personnel with specialized knowledge.

As Tillerson intended to achieve an eight percent reduction in full-time staff, many openings that resulted from resignations, retirement and attrition were left unfilled. Buyouts were also offered to encourage departures. Fewer new Foreign Service members were hired (interest in taking the Foreign Service exam also dropped, with 50 percent fewer registrants in 2017 as opposed to 2015).

Tillerson supported a proposed White House budget that cut funding for his department by 30 percent, which would have impacted both diplomacy and foreign aid. However, Congress disliked the steep cuts and okayed a $51 billion budget in the 2018 appropriations bill, $11 billion more than the administration requested.

In March 2018, Tillerson again called out China ahead of his first formal visit to Africa as secretary of state, accusing the Asian power of forging corrupt deals and endangering natural resources in Africa. He also announced a $533 million humanitarian aid package to help people affected by food shortages and conflict in Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia and the Lake Chad Basin, part of the overall plan of encouraging counterterrorism activity, democracy, governance, trade and investment.

On March 13, 2018, Tillerson's run as secretary of state abruptly ended when President Trump announced via Twitter that he was naming CIA Director Mike Pompeo to the post, with Gina Haspel to become the first woman to head the CIA.

Tillerson did not immediately comment, leaving the response to a statement from a State Department official. ""The Secretary had every intention of staying because of the critical progress made in national security,"" said the statement. ""He will miss his colleagues at the the Department of State and the foreign ministers he has worked with throughout the world.""

Tillerson didn't associate with Trump before the election, and his selection for secretary of state in December 2016 came as a surprise. The then president-elect had been considering picks such as 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor. Tillerson's name was thrown in the ring when former Defense Secretary Robert Gates suggested it to Trump (supported by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice).

Another reason Tillerson may have edged out other candidates is his height. Senator Bob Corker had also been thought of for the position, but apparently Trump believed the senator wasn't tall enough (reportedly, Tillerson is 5-foot-10 while Corker stands at 5-foot-7).

Though Trump initially liked Tillerson's style, their working relationship was not a smooth one. On October 1, 2017, Trump tweeted that Tillerson was ""wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man"" (a reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un). And when Tillerson was trying to mediate a dispute between Qatar and its neighbors, the president accused Qatar of funding terrorism.

Tillerson said ""the president speaks for himself"" when asked about Trump's refusal to condemn white nationalists after violence broke out at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. And a report appeared in October 2017 saying Tillerson had called Trump a ""moron"" earlier in the year; after this the secretary gave a press conference lauding the president.

With the November 2019 publication of her book, With All Due Respect, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley alleged that Tillerson and former Chief of Staff John Kelly pushed her to deliberately undermine President Trump during their time together in the administration. Tillerson disputed that claim in a statement to The Washington Post, saying, ""Ambassador Haley was rarely a participant in my many meetings and is not in a position to know what I may or may not have said to the President. I continue to be proud of my service as our country's 69th Secretary of State.""

Tillerson served as CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil from 2006 to 2016. This put him in charge of a company with around 80,000 employees and annual revenues of $400 billion. He started there as a production engineer in 1975, after graduating college.

Tillerson thrived in Exxon's corporate culture and ended up in charge of overseas operations, which were driven by the pressing need for new oil reserves. To protect the company's investments, Tillerson had to evaluate global conditions in countries as diverse as Venezuela, Nigeria and Iraq. He received assistance in this from the International Government Relations Group at Exxon, whose staff included former State Department employees.

Exxon has a mandatory retirement age of 65, so Tillerson was already preparing to step down when he was nominated to be secretary of state.

Tillerson worked with Vladimir Putin in the 1990s, thanks to an Exxon project on Russia's Sakhalin Island. In 2011, Tillerson had ExxonMobil enter into a deal with Russian oil company Rosneft. Putin, apparently pleased by the deal, awarded Tillerson membership in Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013.

The 2011 agreement could have been worth up to $500 billion, but was put on hold by U.S. sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. In 2017, the Treasury Department fined Exxon $2 million for violating these sanctions in 2014.

Some officials were worried about Tillerson's connections to Russia from his years at ExxonMobil, and several senators asked questions about these ties during Tillerson's confirmation hearing. In the end he was confirmed, but 43 senators voted against him.

In the fall of 2017, Tillerson eliminated the Coordinator for Sanctions Policy office, moving responsibility for sanctions to the Policy Planning Office. The decision was part of his reorganization plan, but it delayed the implementation of sanctions issued for Russia's interference in the 2016 election. It also took several months for Tillerson to request already allocated funds for the Global Engagement Center, a group meant to fight propaganda and disinformation from both terrorists and malicious state actors (Tillerson's view was that he first wanted to ensure the funds would be used effectively).

After Tillerson became head of ExxonMobil, the company began to accept and acknowledge the scientific consensus that the climate is changing. However, Tillerson continued to voice doubts about the immediate need to cut oil and gas use to address the issue, arguing that society would be able to adapt to a changing climate.

Tillerson did support the Paris Agreement on climate change, an international pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions. However, he could not prevent President Trump from opting to withdraw from the accord in June 2017.

An investigation into whether ExxonMobil deceived shareholders regarding its knowledge of the impact of fossil fuels on climate change was conducted by the attorney generals of New York and Massachusetts, with the New York office filing a lawsuit in 2018.

Tillerson's first wife was Jamie Lee Henry, a high school bandmate. They married after Tillerson had graduated college, and had twin boys before divorcing.

By 1983 Tillerson had married Renda House, who had a child of her own. The couple had another son together in 1988.

It was Renda who advised Tillerson to become secretary of state. ""I didn’t want this job. I didn’t seek this job,"" Tillerson admitted in a March 2017 interview with the Independent Journal Review. ""My wife told me I’m supposed to do this.""

When and Where Was Rex Tillerson Born?

Rex Wayne Tillerson was born on March 23, 1952, in Wichita Falls, Texas. His name was inspired by two Hollywood stars known for portraying cowboys: Rex Allen and John Wayne.

Tillerson — the second of three children — spent his childhood in Texas and Oklahoma, moving between small towns with his family. His father left a job selling bread to be a professional organizer for the Boy Scouts of America; Tillerson became a dedicated member of the organization who attained the rank of Eagle Scout.

Like his father, Tillerson stayed connected to scouting as an adult. In addition to joining the boards of the national and Dallas chapters, he served as national president of the Boy Scouts of America from 2010 to 2012. In this role Tillerson supported the inclusion of gay scouts.

Tillerson graduated from Huntsville High in Texas and went on to the University of Texas at Austin. There, he studied civil engineering and played in the Longhorn marching band.

As an adult, Tillerson's home base has remained in Texas. His property includes Bar RR Ranches, with ""RR"" standing for Rex and Renda. In June 2019, he purchased a 16,238 square-foot mansion in Westlake, near Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.

While serving as secretary of state, Tillerson lived in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

At Exxon Tillerson was able to climb the ranks until he was the one giving orders. Accumulating merit badges as a Boy Scout was another organized endeavor. But in his government role, Tillerson encountered difficulties in coping with a chaotic Trump administration and criticism for not being accessible enough to the press.

""It is a lot different than being CEO of Exxon because I was the ultimate decision-maker,"" Tillerson admitted to reporters in the summer of 2017. ""That always makes life easier.""",mainstream
689,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An Alaska law promoting fossil fuel development infringes on the constitutional rights of young residents to a healthy environment, a lawyer told Alaska Supreme Court justices on Wednesday.

A lawsuit filed by 16 Alaska youths claimed long-term effects of climate change will devastate the country's northernmost state and interfere with their constitutional rights to life, liberty and public trust resources that sustain them.

The state's legislative and executive branches have not taken steps to lower greenhouse gas emissions and adopted a policy that promotes putting more in the air, said attorney Andrew Welle of the Oregon-based Our Children's Trust group.

""This is an issue that is squarely within the court's authority,"" Welle said.

Assistant Attorney General Anna Jay urged justices to affirm a lower court ruling rejecting the claims. Ultimately, the climate change issues raised by Alaska youth must be addressed by the political branches of government, she said.

""The court does not have the tools to engage in the type of legislative policy making endeavor required to formulate a broad state approach to greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.

The 16 youths sued in 2017 and claimed damages by greenhouse gas emissions are causing widespread damage in Alaska. The lawsuit said the state has experienced dangerously high temperatures, changed rain and snow patterns, rising seas, storm surge flooding, thawed permafrost, coastal erosion, violent storms and increased wildfires.

Our Children's Trust is a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting natural systems for present and future generations. The group in 2011 unsuccessfully sued the state in 2011, claiming the state failed to adopt measures to protect young people from climate change.

The judge in that case concluded that courts lack scientific, economic and technological resources that agencies can use to determine climate policy and it was best left in their hands.

Alaska has no state sales or income tax and historically has relied on the petroleum industry, which extracts crude oil and sends most of it to West Coast Refineries, for much of its revenue.

Welle said state policy promoting fossil fuels, expressed in a state statute, should be declared unconstitutional because it harms young Alaskans by trading short-term financial gains for long-term health problems.

The lead client in the case, Esau Sinnok, has had his constitutional right to health and happiness denied by state policy and lack of action on climate change, Welle said.

""His home village of Shishmaref is literally wiped off the map because of climate change,"" Welle said before the hearing. ""It's endangering his culture, the very existence of his community, the health and safety of him and his community members.""

Justice Peter Maassen asked Welle if the energy policy was balanced by other policies in state law, such as protection for natural resources and the environment.

""How can we conclude that government agencies are following the energy policy blindly without consideration of these other policies?"" Maassen asked.

Welle said that while statutes provide authority to protect the environment, state agencies have been directed to systemically promote fossil fuels.

Justice Susan Carney called Welle's attention to a newspaper opinion piece by former Gov. Bill Walker in which he acknowledged severe economic effects of climate change.

""Isn't that a sign that state policy has balanced those concerns?"" she asked.

Welle replied that the court when assessing state policies, and their effects on fundamental constitutional rights, can assess the process, look at decisions and decide if balance struck is the most narrowly tailored choice.

114,"WEDNESDAY, July 24, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Scary new life-threatening fungal infections could soon menace mankind, thanks to climate change, a new report argues.

In general, humans are incredibly resistant to fungal infections because these organisms don't thrive in warmth, said lead author Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.

But climate change could be increasing the tolerance of fungi to warmer temperatures, making them more likely to infect humans, Casadevall and his colleagues claim.

The researchers point to an emerging fungal pathogen, Candida auris, as the canary in the coal mine.

""We think this is a harbinger of things that may come,"" Casadevall said of the fungus.

C. auris first appeared as an infection in humans in 2009, with genetically different strains sickening people on three different continents simultaneously, researchers said.

""What could be common to Venezuela, South Africa and India at the same time? These are different regions, populations, climates, you name it,"" Casadevall said.

More than 30% of people with invasive C. auris infections die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been 685 confirmed cases and 30 probable cases in the United States since 2016.

Researchers argue that as the climate has gotten warmer, C. auris has adapted to the point that it can now thrive inside humans.

""We are warm-blooded and our temperatures are very effective at keeping most of the fungi out,"" Casadevall said. ""Most fungi can't reproduce at our body temperature -- about 95% of them cannot. Just being warm gives you a huge protection.""

That's why human fungal infections have thus far been limited to such irritants as athlete's foot, while plant life and cold-blooded creatures are susceptible to fungi that can harm and kill, Casadevall said.

However, fungi can quickly become accustomed to warmer temperatures, research has shown.

""Fungi can adapt to temperature pretty easily,"" Casadevall said. ""If you take a fungus into the laboratory and you slowly raise the temperature, they are able to live and reproduce at higher temperatures.""",mainstream
480,"The subject of climate change makes some people hot under the collar. Solving the problem of global warming is a favorite Democratic platform plank these days. The discussion is not as modern as you might think, though.

For the past 80 years, scientists have been tracking carbon dioxide (CO2) levels around the world. A BBC article cites British engineer Guy Callendar who reported in 1938, after analyzing data from 147 international weather stations that “temperatures had risen over the previous century” as “CO2 concentrations had increased over the same period.” In those days, skeptical meteorologists scoffed at the idea.

During the ensuing decades, more studies were conducted and reports became more dire with rising global CO2 levels. In 1965, a US President’s Advisory Committee panel warned that Americans should be concerned about the greenhouse effect (particulates in the atmosphere trap solar energy, thereby raising global temperatures).

In the 1970s additional furor erupted with the discovery that the earth’s “ozone hole” over Antarctica was getting bigger – alarmingly so.

In 1972, Stockholm, Sweden hosted the first-ever UN environment conference. However, climate change was barely mentioned.

Three years later, in 1975, American scientist Wallace Broecker coined the phrase “global warming” in the title of a scientific paper.

It wasn’t until 1988 that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created to collect and evaluate evidence on climate change. That year, Republican presidential nominee George H.W. Bush said in a speech in Michigan:

“Our land, water and soil support a remarkable range of human activities, but they can only take so much and we must remember to treat them not as a given but as a gift. These issues know no ideology, no political boundaries. It’s not a liberal or conservative thing we’re talking about.”

Since then, the US Democratic party has become the champion of climate change. Liberal leaders pay lip service to solving global climate change, but what gains do they have to show for all their clamor?

Climate change is of understandable concern to younger Americans. One Millennial wrote, in the Huffington Post that “a growing body of research shows that the only way to avoid catastrophic levels of climate change is to cease production of vast amounts of ‘unburnable’ carbon.”

Youthful voters may be swayed in the next election cycle by the issue of climate change. The Huffington Post writer explains:

“A pledge against fossil fuel money would help convince millennials that a candidate deserves a donation, a shift worked on the phone banks and a vote. Virginia Democrats have already reaped the rewards of such a pledge.”

Another article in the Huffington Post ran the title that underscores the notion that Democrats are all talk and no action:

“Democrats Lack A Bold National Climate Change Plan In The Trump Era, And It Shows”

One viable alternative to petroleum-based and nuclear energy pollution, and its negative effects on global climate, is to develop solar energy. So why aren’t we enjoying the benefits of clean, renewable energy right now?

The answer is simple, according to Conserve Energy Future: “high initial capital outlay.” In plain English, it costs too much to produce because the components are expensive and currently, the US has no infrastructure (transmission lines and power stations) to support it.

Still, solar power is a “hot topic” (ouch) these days.

Among the champions of solar energy is Timothy Kaelin, MSEE, MAIT, and CEO of Impact Analytics, an online publishing firm from Boca Raton, Florida.

In a presentation titled “The Energy Net,” featured at the Tenth International Conference on Climate Change: Impact & Responses held in Berkeley, California on April 21, 2018, Kaelin minces no words:

“If we supplant all CO2 generating energy production with solar energy we will solve this problem [climate change].”

Kaelin proposes that the US government dedicate about 25 percent of the one million square miles of federally managed lands to the development of a new solar energy industry. The fed would provide the land, basic infrastructure, and transmission lines to the power grid.

One benefit of such a decisive federal program would be the creation of three to five million jobs. Key to this initiative is keeping all equipment production within the United States to prevent price dilution.

Calling this an “investment with a guaranteed return,” Kaelin believes financing from the private sector for this petroleum-liberating business opportunity would come from at least these four groups:

The key to the success of this plan lies in being able to manufacture “super cheap solar panels” – 80 percent less than those available today – which anyone with $100 could use to set up a personal system with the capability of selling surplus energy produced back to the grid (for a utility bill credit).

Kaelin predicts opposition from existing power plants, which would be doomed to extinction. The solution is to “buy them off” – which is to say, offer them compensation for revenue lost to clean, renewable solar energy.

A US Solar Power Program would satisfy both the Democratic issue of solving climate change and give the Republicans a new economic plan.

Recent research shows that, regardless of political party, Americans are tired of ruining the environment while paying big bucks for their gas and electric bills. Washington State University sociologists Christine Horne (professor) and Emily Kennedy (assistant professor), as reported on Science Direct in the journal “Energy Policy” that “study participants value not only energy costs but also emissions reductions.” Horne shed more light on the technology study:

“Our work shows that U.S. consumers, regardless of political standing, age, or gender, want to use more renewable energy and fewer fossil fuels. With new communication technologies, it is now possible to give them the option to do it.”

Honestly, there really is no downside to developing a new national solar power industry, and President Trump has the opportunity to embrace solar power, not only to serve Americans, but to lead, by example, other nations to petro-independence. Isn’t this the sort of thinking that made the United States a great nation – and a great place to live?

1299,"The highest court in the Netherlands has upheld a ruling requiring the government to slash greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% of 1990 levels by the end of next year.

The case was brought six years ago by the Urgenda environment group in a bid to force ministers to go well beyond EU targets.

However, the chances of the government reaching the target look slim.

By the end of 2018, emissions were down only 15% on 1990 levels.

Dutch environment researchers believe that levels could be cut by 23% by the end of 2020 but believe the reduction could be as low as 19%.
• Last decade 'on course' to be warmest

The government in The Hague presented its climate accord at the end of June, with plans for a 49% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and phasing out coal-fired power generation starting in 2020.

While there have been cuts in methane and nitrous oxide as well as other gases, levels of carbon dioxide emissions have changed little in the Netherlands since 1990.

Last month, under pressure to act over a nitrogen oxide pollution crisis, Dutch ministers announced a cut in the daytime speed limit to 100km/h (62mph). The Council of State forced the government to act in that case, by declaring that rules for granting building and farming permits were in breach of EU law protecting nature.

In its decision on Friday, the Supreme Court said it had based its ruling (in Dutch) on the UN climate convention and the state's legal obligation to protect the lives and well-being of Dutch citizens.

""There is a great deal of consensus in the scientific and international community over the urgent need for a reduction in greenhouse gases by at least 25% by developed countries,"" the court said.

While the EU target for a cut in carbon emissions is 20% of 1990 levels, Urgenda took up the case on behalf of 886 Dutch citizens, arguing that their government had a legal duty to prevent climate change and should seek a bigger reduction.

They first won their case in June 2015 but it was challenged by the government all the way to the Supreme Court.",mainstream
453,"Vancouver, BC – Exclusive new video published to social media on January 20, 2017, predicts a dark dystopian high-tech militarized future for America based upon expert analysis and interpretation of secret messages encrypted backwards in the inaugural address of President Donald J. Trump. The Capitol building in Washington, D.C., was the scene for today’s inauguration of the 45th President of the United States. Secret messages detected in the president’s remarks point to plans for (or the existence of) a military moon base. More disturbing findings suggest the president embodies some of the worst of Roman excesses and compare him with CIA Jonestown cult leader Jim Jones.

UPDATE: The New York Times reported January 2, 2020, how U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the drone missile strike assassination of Iranian Quds Force General Qassim Suleimani in Baghdad. NewsInsideOut.com’s earlier 2017 inaugural address coverage identified sleep talking-like remarks concerning “A war. Missile must smash your brain.” as documented in the report below. The Times confirmed on January 4 that “Soleimani had been in Trump’s sights since the beginning of the administration.” The drone strike against Qassim Suleimani offers a tell that the U.S. and Iran are now at war (that the strike occurs in a state of war) indicated by results from a granular audio speech synthesis study reported nearly three years earlier. Twitteratti note President Trump previously cited war with Iran as a ploy for domestic political gain. Drone Wars critics see this administration’s key role in increased operational frequency and scope of civilian casualties giving CIA independent strike authority and increased secrecy over reporting deaths.

UPDATE: Speaking to flight controllers, engineers and astronauts at the Johnson Space Center on August 23, 2018, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence reportedly announced “The time has come for the United States of America to … establish a permanent presence around and on the moon.” See “U.S. President’s Moon Base Initiative Media Timeline” below.

“President Trump’s Military Moon Base: The Secret Inaugural Messages” appears among the latest investigative findings from former CBS Radio feature producer and NewsInsideOut.com reporter Jon Kelly. The acclaimed analyst’s earlier discovery of military-grade intelligence concerning the Iraq War in the 2001 inaugural address of President George W. Bush was proven accurate by real-world events that followed upon its release sixteen years ago this Monday.

As a popular guest on talk radio Jon Kelly would go on to identify serial killers, name Russian spies, and detect the UFO information in Edward Snowden’s NSA cache. Most recently his published findings are confirmed to have beaten The Intercept in reporting a revived CIA Phoenix assassination program three years before the Snowden press.

This legacy of unassailable excellence continues where “President Trump’s Military Moon Base: The Secret Inaugural Messages” makes solid connections with existing lines of published inquiry. Citations are provide that offer links for the viewer to various authors who have already established ties between the president and the various themes articulated through the digital audio mirror.

In terms of Moon bases, the president’s secret message gives reference to the satellite while discussing the role of the military in national security. This apparent reference to Earth’s closest neighbor parallels the behavior of James Mattis, who was found in his Senate confirmation hearing last week to express suggestions of a “Mars mission”. As SecDef the cabinet nominee would only provide oversite to military operations.

In a post-Gary-McKinnon-failed-extradition-attempt world it seems apparent the president and his cabinet are occupied with thoughts of secret military space missions. The Atlantic reported at the beginning of this month how “upon leaving the president-elect’s office, Douglas Brinkley, a historian and conservationist, reported that Trump “was very interested in a man going to the moon.”

The video contains an invocation to war but does not identify a clear threat or enemy. The Moon appears sequentially after this invocation in a way that suggests it’s a prize to be won in an angry battle. Perhaps in this mirror way the president is trying to tell us something about competitive behavior and low-intensity warfare between partner nations over the further militarization of space. President Bush’s 2001 inaugural address revealed a similar pattern in which the president was then observed discussing traditional American values while uttering an encrypted invocation to invade Iraq.

There are references in the video to cannabis legalization and facial recognition surveillance. In December the Daily Beast wrote how the president’s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), could “redirect the Drug Enforcement Administration to go after legal marijuana growers in states from Maine to Alaska.”

The Intercept wrote yesterday that “Backgrounds of the members of the team that President-elect Donald Trump is picking to shape the Department of Homeland Security suggests he will aggressively pursue surveillance using the latest technological advancements,” with an emphasis on “facial-recognition technology.”

NewsInsideOut.com 2016 campaign coverage included articles about a “future Trump presidency characterized by surveillance, dystopian false flags and prison camps.” Stories reflected how “an intensified focus on cybersecurity in such a climate would take place under the name of an anticipated “War on Illegal Immigration.”

In an article from last spring the UK Guardian noted the president’s “fascinating parallels” with Caligula, “one of the most notorious of all Roman emperors.” That report went on to describe how “The young Caligula spent six years on the island of Capri, where he often directed and appeared in spectacular pornographic tableaux for his great uncle, the emperor Tiberius – a man it was said, who enjoyed having swimming boys nibble at his private parts.”

President Trump, whose ex-wife Ivana swore under oath that he allegedly raped her, is now cited as the “first porn president” in an item that appeared on today’s Slate. There the president is said to have appeared in three soft-core porn films produced by Playboy during the 1990s.

NewsInsideOut.com covering the “Watersportsgate” press conference held last week disclosed evidence of urophilia. This is a condition intelligence agencies claimed makes the president hostage to Russian blackmail demands and possibly party to treachery in aid of Russian interests.

Finally, a surprising and unexpected comparison with CIA Jonestown cult leader Jim Jones is offered to the viewer for consideration. Both President Trump and Jones are portrayed uttering invocations to Moloch and collective suicide. Moloch is an ancient Canaanite deity of child sacrifice. At its most benign Moloch signifies the passage of time that changes children to adults. At worst the president appears to disclose ritualistic elements of child sexual abuse that induces an end of innocence and entry into a form of dysfunctional precociousness such as that said to occur on Sex Slave Island.

“President Trump’s Military Moon Base: The Secret Inaugural Messages,” offers a video filled with “crazy” and “excessive” images of a dystopian future on par with those said to have fueled the president’s winning campaign. Mounting evidence points to the further militarization of space accompanied by war and environmentally/socially rapacious domestic policy.

Sorry, America, it appears you struck out with Donald Trump’s “new vision.” This reporter can only hope for some sort of miraculous intervention on the part of the president’s better angels (if there are any left post-“American carnage”).

The following is a partial transcript of the inaugural address of United States President Donald J. Trump from the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., from earlier today preceded by the secret message encrypted backwards therein. Full text of the address is available via the UK Independent. Discussion of methods and philosophy informing these conclusions can be found throughout this reporter’s previous related coverage accessible in links below.

Caesar was their love. Kidnap, rape you: “We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own. And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We have made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.”

A war. Missile must smash your brain. Nazis: “We will bring new roads and high roads and bridges and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.”

I won the Moon in anger: “There should be no fear, we are protected and will always be protected by the great men and women of our military and most importantly we will be protected by god.”

Hell with Moloch. Make a flower a crime. Make a face a crime: “Your voice, your hopes and dreams will define your American destiny. Your courage, goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America safe again and yes – together we will make America great again.”

We shall die. The crime is so black: “Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you. God bless America.”

The following select readings curated from mainstream and alternative news reports offer a brief survey in an atmosphere of public confusion suggesting how little was known of the president’s plans to return to the moon prior to NewsInsideOut.com’s January 20, 2017, inaugural address coverage.

November 20, 2016: “Once he assumes the presidency officially, Trump is expected to appoint Republicans to key positions who also advocate a return to the moon.” See U.K. Daily Mail “Trump is ‘set to take America back to the moon and ditch NASA’s climate change research‘”

December 12, 2016: “Even NASA insiders are reduced to reading tea leaves and possible smoke signals.” See New York Times “Where Will NASA Go in the Age of Trump?”

January 4, 2017: “Douglas Brinkley, a historian and conservationist, reported that Trump “was very interested in a man going to the moon.” Before that point, the entirety of Trump’s utterances of space policy consisted of two sentences: “Honestly I think NASA is wonderful!” and “Right now, we have bigger problems… We’ve got to fix our potholes.”” See The Atlantic “Trump Might Be Thinking About a Moon Base”

713,"Beto Doubles Down on Gun Confiscation: 'It’s Not Voluntary, it’s Mandatory'

2020 hopeful Beto O'Rourke doubled down on his promise to ban every semi-automatic rifle in America despite a backlash.

O'Rourke rejected the idea that the gun confiscation would involve Americans voluntarily handing over their legally purchased firearms.

""It's not voluntary. It's mandatory."" O'Rourke said.

But O'Rourke avoided answering the question regarding how far he would go on enforcing such a law.

He also avoided questions on whether federal agents would come to people's homes to confiscate their firearms.

""I'm going to work with ... law enforcement to make sure that we implement this in the most effective way possible,"" O'Rourke said.

""It is mandatory. It will be the law. You will be required to comply with the law,"" O'Rourke restated.

""As with many of our laws, we don't go door to door searching people's homes to see if they are, in fact, breaking the law. We expect people to comply with the law.""

When the former Texas congressman was asked how he would confiscate people's legally purchased rifles, he said he intended to change the law.

""We are going to change the law so it will no longer be legal to hold one these,"" he said.

As NewsThud reported, when the 2020 Democratic hopeful was asked whether he would confiscate Americans' guns during the ABC News Democratic debate Thursday, and he answered, “hell yes.”

“Some of the stage have suggested a voluntary buy-back for guns in this country. You have said, ‘Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.’ You know that critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns and how would this work?” ABC’s David Muir asked.

“I am, if it’s a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield. If the high impact, high velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that so you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers,” O’Rourke continued.

Also during the debate, O’Rourke claimed that President Donald Trump was responsible for the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas last month.

Beto claimed, without evidence, that the horrific attack that killed 22 people and injured 24 others shows “just how dangerous Donald Trump is.”

The Democratic 2020 candidate went so far as to state that the El Paso shooter was “inspired to kill” by President Trump:

“On August 3rd, in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me, and I think produced a turning point for this country,"" Beto said.

710,"The Arctic is predicted to warm faster than anywhere else in the world this century, perhaps by as much as 7°C. These rising temperatures threaten one of the largest long-term stores of carbon on land: permafrost.

Permafrost is permanently frozen soil. The generally cold temperatures in the Arctic keep soils there frozen year-on-year. Plants grow in the uppermost soil layers during the short summers and then decay into soil, which freezes when the winter snow arrives.

Over thousands of years, carbon has built up in these frozen soils, and they’re now estimated to contain twice the carbon currently in the atmosphere. Some of this carbon is more than 50,000 years old, which means the plants that decomposed to produce that soil grew over 50,000 years ago. These soil deposits are known as “Yedoma”, which are mainly found in the East Siberian Arctic, but also in parts of Alaska and Canada.

As the region warms, the permafrost is thawing, and this frozen carbon is being released to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane. Methane release is particularly worrying, as it’s a highly potent greenhouse gas.

But a recent study suggested that the release of methane from ancient carbon sources – sometimes referred to as the Arctic methane “bomb” – didn’t contribute much to the warming that occurred during the last deglaciation – the period after the last ice age. This occurred 18,000 to 8,000 years ago, a period that climate scientists study intently, as it’s the last time global temperatures rose by 4°C, which is roughly what is predicted for the world by 2100.

This study suggested to many that ancient methane emissions are not something we should be worried about this century. But in new research, we found that this optimism may be misplaced.

Read more: The Arctic is turning brown because of weird weather – and it could accelerate climate change

We went to the East Siberian Arctic to compare the age of different forms of carbon found in the ponds, rivers and lakes. These waters thaw during the summer and leak greenhouse gases from the surrounding permafrost. We measured the age of the carbon dioxide, methane and organic matter found in these waters using radiocarbon dating and found that most of the carbon released to the atmosphere was overwhelmingly “young”. Where there was intense permafrost thaw, we found that the oldest methane was 4,800 years old, and the oldest carbon dioxide was 6,000 years old. But over this vast Arctic landscape, the carbon released was mainly from young plant organic matter.

This means that the carbon produced by plants growing during each summer growing season is rapidly released over the next few summers. This rapid turnover releases much more carbon than the thaw of older permafrost, even where severe thaw is occurring.

So what does this mean for future climate change? It means that carbon emissions from a warming Arctic may not be driven by the thawing of an ancient frozen carbon bomb, as it’s often described. Instead, most emissions may be relatively new carbon that is produced by plants that grew fairly recently.

What this shows is that the age of the carbon released from the warming Arctic is less important than the amount and form it takes. Methane is 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas over a 100-year timeframe. The East Siberian Arctic is a generally flat and wet landscape, and these are conditions which produce lots of methane, as there’s less oxygen in soils which might otherwise create carbon dioxide during thaws instead. As a result, potent methane could well dominate the greenhouse gas emissions from the region.

Since most of the emissions from the Arctic this century will likely be from “young” carbon, we may not need to worry about ancient permafrost adding substantially to modern climate change. But the Arctic will still be a huge source of carbon emissions, as carbon that was soil or plant matter only a few hundred years ago leaches to the atmosphere. That will increase as warmer temperatures lengthen growing seasons in the Arctic summer.

The fading spectre of an ancient methane time bomb is cold comfort. The new research should urge the world to act boldly on climate change, to limit how much natural processes in the Arctic can contribute to the problem.",mainstream
176,"Tackling climate change must be woven into the solution to the Covid-19 economic crisis, the UK will tell governments next week.

Environment ministers from 30 countries are meeting in a two-day online conference in a bid to make progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

The gathering is called the ""Petersberg Climate Dialogue"".

It will focus on how to organise a ""green"" economic recovery after the acute phase of the pandemic is over.

The other aim is to forge international agreement on ambitious carbon cuts despite the postponement of the key conference COP26 - previously scheduled for Glasgow in November (now without a date).

Alok Sharma, the UK Climate Secretary and president of COP26, said: ""I am committed to increasing global climate ambition so that we deliver on the Paris Agreement (to stabilise temperature rise well below 2C).

""The world must work together, as it has to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, to support a green and resilient recovery, which leaves no one behind.

""At the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, we will come together to discuss how we can turn ambition into real action.""
• Virus will transform UK work and travel, says AA

The informal conference is co-hosted by the UK and Germany.

Developed and developing countries will attend, along with the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, and members of civil society and business. Last week, Mr Guterres warned that climate change was a deeper problem than the virus.

Campaign groups will be sceptical about the meeting. Since the Paris deal to cut emissions, CO2 has actually been rising - although there's currently a blip in the trend thanks to the Covid recession.

The development charity CARE says it's alarmed that public finance provided from rich countries to developing countries to adapt to inevitable climate change actually decreased in 2018.

Sven Harmeling from CARE said: ""If governments fail to make their economic stimulus sustainable and equitable, they will drive our planet much deeper into the existential economic, social and ecological turmoil caused by the climate crisis.""

The EU is already set on delivering a green stimulus. The Commission's Green Deal chief, Frans Timmermans, said every euro spent on economic recovery measures after the COVID-19 crisis would be linked to the green and digital transitions.

""The European Green Deal is a growth strategy and a winning strategy,"" he tweeted.

""It's not a luxury we drop when we hit another crisis. It is essential for Europe's future.

Meanwhile, China appears set on its current carbon-intensive development path, and President Trump says the US will rescue struggling fossil fuel firms.

Even in Europe there's a degree of push-back against the idea of a green stimulus .

Markus Pieper, an MEP from the centre-right German CDU party, told the magazine FOCUS that the EU's sweeping plan for investment in clean technologies would no longer be possible.

He said: ""The Green Deal was a gigantic challenge for an economy in top shape. After the corona bloodletting, it is simply not financially viable.""

But the UK climate economist Lord Stern told BBC News: ""The immediate priority is the current Covid crisis – but then we have to build for the future.

""Timmermans is right and Trump is wrong. We should only be bailing out firms that are going to contribute to tackling climate change.

""They don’t have be be ostensibly clean tech firms at the moment – but they do have to be committed to cutting their emissions in line with international targets.""

975,"There is no denying the severity of the climate crisis. Our planet is in serious need of help and if we do not do something, things will never be the same.

Now, one area many seem to be getting behind that could prove to have a serious impact on the climate crisis is geoengineering, particularly solar geoengineering. For those who do not know, geoengineering according to Harvard ‘refers to a set of emerging technologies that could manipulate the environment and partially offset some of the impacts of climate change.’ One of the ways geoengineering is trying to make progress in this area is through possibly spraying particles into the stratosphere that may cool us down a bit/block out some of the light/heat we get from the sun itself. This specific concept is overseen by SCoPEx and backed by several different big names including that of Bill Gates.

Basically, this in itself would mimic the effects of a giant volcanic eruption according to CNBC. Those working on this would have thousands of planes flying up to higher altitudes and spraying these particles around our Mother Earth creating in some was the equivalent to a cloud of dust. This cloud of dust would cool things down and if it worked, it might prove to be a real answer. However, things like this may come with serious risks/consequences as we do not know how they may play out.

While plans of this concept have been out for a while we have not gotten any real updates as of late. Sure, it might sound a bit out there or like something you’d see happen in a movie this could potentially create a huge sunshade and reflect the rays beating down on us back at the sun itself. Scientists at Harvard University are hard at work figuring things out and doing tests.

Back in April 2019, Andy Parker did, however, tell CNBC as follows on the topic:

“Modeling studies have found that it could reduce the intensity of heatwaves, for instance, apparently it could reduce the rate of sea-level rise. It could reduce the intensity of tropical storms,”

While true solar geoengineering itself might seem like a faraway idea, it’s been in the works for a long time now and may end up being put to use in the future. While doing this is not an ‘end all be all’ for fixing the world as it won’t reverse the effects of global warming trends but it could slow things down a bit. We’ve heard over and over again that these ‘dust’ particles would be sprayed in the sky but it doesn’t seem there is any proof they are right now. It seems at the moment computer modeling studies and other things of the sort are still in the works.

For more information on all of this check out the videos below. While it might not sound like much it’s important to be aware of. Things like this are quite mind-blowing whether they play out or not. What are your thoughts on solar geoengineering? Is it more dangerous than thought to be or is it possible that something so ‘simple’ could help us all?

With tons of people very much against solar geoengineering and geoengineering as a whole, there has to be some negatives to it. Things like this are quite confusing and we just don’t know enough about them yet. In the end, I guess only time will tell how things will play out.",conspiracy
1051,"1. Over the past three years, climate change has become a pillar of the U.S.-China bilateral relationship. Both countries have taken strong measures at home to build green, low-carbon and climate-resilient economies, helping galvanize global action to combat climate change and culminating in the Paris Agreement reached last December. With their joint announcement of ambitious climate actions in November 2014, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping sought to lead by example, and by the time the Paris conference opened a year later, some 186 countries had put forward their own climate actions. In September 2015, the two leaders laid out a common vision for the Paris outcome during President Xi’s State Visit to Washington and also announced major domestic policy measures and cooperative initiatives to combat climate change, as well as significant progress on climate finance. In Paris, the United States and China, working together and with others, played a critical role in crafting a historic, ambitious global climate change agreement.

2. Today, the two Presidents announce another significant step in their joint climate efforts. The United States and China will sign the Paris Agreement on April 22nd and take their respective domestic steps in order to join the Agreement as early as possible this year. They encourage other Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to do the same, with a view to bringing the Paris Agreement into force as early as possible. The Presidents further express their commitment to work together and with others to promote the full implementation of the Paris Agreement to win the fight against the climate threat.

3. The Presidents recognize that the Paris Agreement marks a global commitment to tackling climate change and a strong signal of the need for a swift transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies. In this regard, the Presidents are also committed to working bilaterally and with other countries to achieve successful outcomes this year in related multilateral fora, including on an HFC amendment under the Montreal Protocol pursuant to the Dubai Pathway and on a global market-based measure for addressing greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation at the International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly. To accelerate clean energy innovation and deployment, they will work together to implement the goals of the Mission Innovation initiative announced at the Paris conference and carry forward the work of the Clean Energy Ministerial. They support a successful G-20 Summit in Hangzhou this year, including strong climate and clean energy outcomes, and call on the G-20 countries to engage constructively in international cooperation on energy and climate change. And they will continue to deepen and broaden bilateral cooperation through the U.S.-China Climate Change Working Group, the U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center, and other efforts.

4. Finally, the Presidents commit to taking concrete steps to implement the commitments they made in their September 2015 Joint Statement to use public resources to finance and encourage the transition toward low carbon technologies as a priority. Since the Joint Statement, the United States led an effort in the OECD to successfully adopt the first-ever set of multilateral standards for support of coal-fired power plants using export credit, and China has been strengthening its green and low-carbon policies and regulations with a view to strictly controlling public investment flowing into projects with high pollution and carbon emissions both domestically and internationally.

1131,"You might think of it — it being human civilization as we know it today — as the product of a lucky greenhouse.

These days we talk about climate change mostly in terms of a threat. It represents a set of new risks to our health, our infrastructure, our relatively stable existence. But ages before humans began to adding to that change, the climate system created the perfect conditions for human existence during a period called the Holocene.

“It’s no coincidence that during that stable period of climate that we’ve had the development of human civilization as we know it,” said Jeffrey Shaman, director of the climate and health program and an associate professor at Columbia University.

“Agriculture started, human urbanization started — all this benefited because we actually had a very remarkably long period of time, 10,000 to 12,000 years of the Holocene, in which temperatures didn’t really move that much globally.”

But Shaman said our climate tampering could introduce some nasty disruptions to the climate coddling we’ve taken for granted until this point in our history. Swings in temperatures, changing weather patterns, and sea level rise could all have serious effects on human health writ large, he said. “It’s going to be more difficult to feed ourselves, there will be more heat-related morbidity and mortality.”

814,"A warmer world means more and greater extremes in destructive and dangerous weather, such as heat waves, wildfires, droughts, flooding, and violent storms. There were 70 tropical cyclones or hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere in 2018, compared with the long-term average of 53. Powerful and often record-breaking storms brought devastation to the Mariana Islands, Philippines, Vietnam, Korea, and Tonga. In the U.S., hurricanes Florence and Michael caused huge economic damage and considerable loss of life, the WMO noted in its annual climate statement.

Heat waves resulted in an astounding loss in productivity in 2018, because it was often either too hot to work or even go outside safely. An incredible 153 billion hours of labour were wiped out last year due to heat waves, nearly three times more than 2000, according to the 2018 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change released November 28.

The most recent El Niño event ended in 2016, and it was associated with catastrophic coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, severe droughts in Africa, South America and parts of the Pacific and southeast Asia, and wildfires in Indonesia and Canada. While the current El Niño is not expected to be as severe, it could still bring dangerous weather to vulnerable areas around the world, scientists warn.

El Niño and its opposite, La Niña, form a natural cycle that can last from a few months to two or three years. When they occur, weather patterns around the world can be affected, producing a range of impacts on crop yields, famine, heating, and cooling demands of homes and buildings, fire risks, coral bleaching, and extreme weather. Researchers say the impacts of El Niño/La Niña events have become more severe over the past 20 years due to a warmer climate. This is akin to an athlete on steroids who takes stimulants during the Olympic final.

The combination of human-caused warming and a natural upswing in temperatures increases the odds that any new El Niño year will be the warmest ever, said climate scientist Michael Mann from Pennsylvania State University.

Mann co-authored a 2018 study linking climate change to the recent run of record-breaking droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and flooding events in the northern hemisphere. These destructive weather extremes will increase 50 percent on average and may increase as much as 300 percent due to climate change alone unless the world acts quickly to cut carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels, the study concluded.

Normally, El Niño events bring heavy rains to California, and if that happens this winter it could lead to flash flooding and mud slides after wildfires burned 1.6 million acres this autumn, said Stevenson. Nearly 14,000 homes were destroyed in those fires and now the first storms of the season have already produced flooding and mud slides.

While El Niño brings rain and cooler weather to the southern U.S., it brings heat and drought to Australia, as well as dry winter conditions in southeastern Africa and northern Brazil. Catastrophic wildfires have already broken out in eastern Australia, along with a heat wave with temperatures over 44 degrees C (111 degrees F) at the end of November.

As global warming continues future El Niño events will likely result in even cooler and wetter conditions in the U.S., enhancing flood risks. Meanwhile, La Niña events will increase wildfire danger and drought in the southwestern United States, Stevenson said.

While the impacts of El Niño/La Niña events are amplified in a warmer world, it’s not known whether climate change will affect the occurrence or strength of these events in the future, she said.

La Niña and El Niño are, respectively, the cold and warm phases of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, which regulates heat in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. In conditions defined by climatologists as ""neutral,"" high air pressure predominates in the eastern Pacific, while low pressure predominates in the west. The difference in pressure generates the trade winds, which blow east to west over the surface of the tropical Pacific, pushing the warm waters westward. The deeper, cooler waters then surface in the east, replacing the warm waters.",mainstream
482,"Madrid, Spain - With higher-than-average increases in temperature, steadily advancing desertification and rising risks of drought and sea flooding, few would disagree that Spain is on the front line of Europe's battle against climate change.

But while government officials point to the ongoing COP25 conference as a sign of Spain's firm engagement in the battle against global warming, continuing political deadlock means the country's long wait for a law to fight climate change on home turf continues.
• Five bright ideas for the future from COP25's 'green zone'
• Madrid may be hosting COP25, but its own eco-challenges persist

In November, Spain held its fourth general election in four years, which was won by the Socialist Party. But the Socialists' repeated failure to secure a parliamentary majority leaves Spain currently dependent on a caretaker government that cannot pass new laws.

This includes legislation on global warming drafted nearly a year ago, which Spain is said to need to ensure it reaches its 2030 targets on carbon emissions, and despite the Spanish parliament recognising - by an overwhelming 311 votes to 24 - that climate change ""was a cross-party priority"".

""A climate change law doesn't just raise public awareness, it also mainstreams the question across all government policy areas,"" Maik Winges, a specialist on adaption to climate change with the environmental NGO Germanwatch, told Al Jazeera.

""That matters because you cannot adapt [to climate change] and leave something else out in the process.""

Germanwatch's own analysis of Climate Change Performance [CCP] by country also suggests Spain's need for urgent action. Spain is currently ranked 35th in the latest available 2019 CCP index from 2019, rated ""low"", and 19 places below the average for the European Union.

How badly does Spain need a climate change law? Delia Gutierrez Rubio, spokeswoman for Spain's state meteorological service, AEMET, says: ""It is necessary for sure.""

Gutierrez Rubio told Al Jazeera it's clear Spain is exceptionally vulnerable to climate change.

""Since the pre-industrial era, the world's average increase in temperature has averaged 1.1 degrees Centigrade (about 1.98 degrees Fahrenheit) - but in Spain, it's 1.6 degrees (2.88F).

""Our summers are an average of five weeks longer, the number of tropical nights [with temperatures above 20 degrees Celcius (68F)] is increasing, and since 50 years ago, Spain's desert areas have increased by 10 percent. And they're getting bigger.""

A Spanish government report recently predicted a possible rise of between 17 and 35 cm (6.7 - 13.7 inches) in sea level along Spain’s lengthy coastline as soon as 2028 - and it's not just humans feeling the effects, as independent investigations on bird migration patterns suggest.

""Europe's entire population of cranes, for example, used to spend the winter in Spain and in the north of Africa, but now they are staying in France or Germany,"" points out Javier Cano, an ornithologist who works with the SEO-Birdlife NGO.

""Then African species like the trumpeter finch, the spotted vulture or the cream-coloured courser are starting to reproduce in Spain. Twenty or 30 years ago, that wouldn’t have happened.""

While government officials say there is EU praise for their proposed climate change law, NGOs and specialist academics in Spain have concerns over what it can actually achieve.

""It doesn't do enough in areas like agricultural transport, which has a particularly large carbon footprint in Spain,"" Professor Alberto Mataran Ruiz, an environmental scientist at the University of Granada, told Al Jazeera.

""It gives a great deal of importance to photovoltaic solar energy, too, when building these kinds of solar panels can involve a great deal of CO2 production. And they don't go into enough detail on the effects on territory their plans for wind energy could have.

""It's like they have a plan, but they don't have a road map.""

Javier Andaluz is the climate change spokesman at Ecologistas en Accion (Ecologists in Action).

""Overall, the advances so far have been more symbolic than real,"" he told Al Jazeera, saying the Socialists had an uneven track record on environmental action, which justified his reservations about the proposed law.

Requests made by Al Jazeera for an interview with officials from Spain's Ministry for Ecological Transition were turned down due to a lack of availability. But popular pressure on the government to act shows no sign of disappearing.

A survey in the newspaper El País published on Sunday indicated that 90.5 percent of Spanish people believe ""urgent"" or ""very urgent"" measures were needed to act against climate change.

However - and even while COP25 continues for a second week in their capital - when it comes to legally binding action on home soil, the Spanish will have to wait.",mainstream
706,"VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis accused world leaders on Thursday of failing to listen to the concerns of youngsters pushing for global action against climate change.

In his annual speech to Vatican diplomats, the pontiff said climate change was a ""concern of everyone,"" despite a tepid response from the international community.

""Many young people have become active in calling the attention of political leaders to the issue of climate change. Care for our common home ought to be a concern of everyone,"" he said.

""Sadly, the urgency of this ecological conversion seems not to have been grasped by international politics, where the response to the problems raised by global issues such as climate change remains very weak and a source of grave concern.""

Since his papacy began in 2013, the Argentine pontiff has often argued for better protection of the environment. In April, he met teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who launched the Fridays for Future youth moment against climate change.

That movement has seen millions of people go on strike or spill into the streets demanding climate action.

Around the world, governments faced with a crescendo of deadly weather and dire alarms from science have failed to signal a real determination to act.

Francis said the UN conference in Madrid in December -- widely considered to have been a flop -- raised ""serious concern about the will of the international community to confront with wisdom and effectiveness the phenomenon of global warming"".

The climate crisis threatening the planet ""demands a collective response capable of placing the common good over particular interests,"" Francis said.

He prayed for those affected by devastating fires in Australia and other areas of Oceania.

Australia's months-long bushfire disaster has killed at least 26 people, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and scorched some eight million hectares (80,000 square kilometres) -- an area the size of Ireland.",mainstream
8,"Nine key 'tipping points' that will lead to catastrophic global warming have been reached, a group of leading scientists have warned.

Scientists say that in these areas sufficient damage has been done that the effects of global warming could accelerate and create a 'cascade' effect.

Because tipping points have been crossed, it could lead to a domino effect, accelerating global warming impacts, threatening human existence, scientists warn.

'The situation is urgent and we need an emergency response', said said Tim Lenton, head of the University of Exeter team behind this study.

'The growing threat of rapid, irreversible changes means it is no longer responsible to wait and see what happens.'

In the journal Nature, the scientists said urgent action was needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - as other key tipping points, that have not yet been activated could soon be hit.

Other tipping points not currently activated include heating up of deep water in the Antarctic, and the release of methane stored in the Ocean in polar regions.

They also identified a reduction in rainfall in the Indian monsoon, and a major loss of oxygen in the ocean as potential areas of risk.

Professor Lenton said: 'A decade ago we identified a suite of potential tipping points in the Earth system, now we see evidence that over half of them have been activated.'

His co-author Johan Rockström, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said it was not only human pressures on Earth that continue to rise at unprecedented levels.

'It is also that as science advances, we must admit that we have underestimated the risks of unleashing irreversible changes, where the planet self-amplifies global warming.

'This is what we now start seeing, already at 1°C global warming.

'Scientifically, this provides strong evidence for declaring a state of planetary emergency, to unleash world action that accelerates the path towards a world that can continue evolving on a stable planet.'

The collapse of major ice sheets on Greenland, West Antarctica and part of East Antarctica would result in around 10 metres of irreversible sea-level rise.

Despite most countries having signed the Paris Agreement, pledging to keep global warming well below 2°C, current national emissions pledges - even if they are met - would lead to 3°C of warming.

Although future tipping points and the interplay between them is difficult to predict, the scientists argue: 'If damaging tipping cascades can occur and a global tipping cannot be ruled out, then this is an existential threat to civilisation.

'No amount of economic cost-benefit analysis is going to help us. We need to change our approach to the climate problem.'

Professor Lenton added: 'We might already have crossed the threshold for a cascade of inter-related tipping points.

'However, the rate at which they progress, and therefore the risk they pose, can be reduced by cutting our emissions.'

Though global temperatures have fluctuated over millions of years, the authors say humans are now 'forcing the system'.

'With atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and global temperature increasing at rates that are an order of magnitude higher than at the end of the last ice age.'

Will Steffen professor of climate and Earth system science at the Australian National University said the study shows two of the tipping points - coral reefs and Arctic sea ice - may have already been tipped.

'The consequence of activating such a cascade would be an unstoppable slide into hothouse Earth conditions.

'The schoolchildren are right - we indeed have a climate emergency, and an emergency-level response is now needed to ensure that we don't activate the tipping cascade.'

The research has been published in the journal Nature.",mainstream
625,"On a hot summer’s day, marine ecologist Courtney Greiner walks the shore of a rocky Washington beach at low tide with a handful of staff and interns. They stake out the ground and hunch down, digging up the top two inches of mud, silt, and gravel looking for baby clams.

For thousands of years, the indigenous peoples of the West Coast would build rock walls at the low tide line, allowing sand to pile up behind them, making the slope of the beach gentler, and expanding the area of the intertidal zone that clams like to call home. These simple clam gardens are effective at boosting shellfish numbers, and have long been used to improve food security for traditional peoples.

Now the Swinomish are reviving the old idea to build the first modern clam garden in the United States. Greiner, who works for the Swinomish tribe, is collecting the data that will help the tribe determine the garden’s best location. The project aims to boost clam numbers, providing both a sense of purpose for the community and additional food as other resources, like salmon, decline.

This is just part of the Swinomish’s plan to ensure the ongoing prosperity of their people in the face of a changing climate. “They were the first native community — and really one of the first communities, period — to make climate adaptation a priority,” says Meade Krosby, a conservation biologist with the University of Washington’s Climate Impacts Group. The tribe’s climate proclamation came out in 2007, and their action plan, published in 2010, was one of the first such documents in the United States. “They’re early adopters and really innovative,” she says.

The Swinomish have already launched projects aimed at helping the community adapt to a shifting climate in the Pacific Northwest. To protect salmon runs, the tribe is working on the Skagit River to create better spawning beds and is planting trees to provide shade and reduce river temperatures. In addition, the tribe is fighting to block mining operations in the headwaters of the Skagit in British Columbia, which could impact waters downstream.

Another project aims to restore a healthy population of native Olympia oysters, long threatened by pollution and crowding out by competitive Pacific oysters and now impacted by ocean acidification. Workers have brought in truckloads of oyster shells and dumped them on beaches to provide new homes for imported natives; the imports grow well, says Greiner, but so far have yet to produce a next generation of shellfish. “It’s a learning process,” she says. A site for the first clam garden should be chosen by next year. And a wetlands project is documenting the local plants that have ecological and cultural importance to the Swinomish, as part of efforts to better manage the changing coast for salmon and farmers alike.

Across North America, other indigenous communities are stepping up to formulate and enact climate action plans to protect their way of life. In 2019, the Karuk tribe of northern California released its climate adaptation plan with a recommendation to return to prescribed burning, an old idea that might help to ease California’s wildfire problems. The Tulalip tribes of Washington state are relocating nuisance beavers from urban areas back to traditional watersheds to help lower river temperatures and aid salmon populations; they are also redirecting agricultural runoff for electricity generation.

The Jamestown S’Klallam tribe in Washington is removing invasive butterfly bushes from the banks of the Dungeness River to help protect its salmon. The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana are gathering and planting seedlings of the whitebark pine that are more resistant to warming-related diseases such as blister rust. Alaskan tribes are using microscopy to identify harmful algae blooms spurred by warming waters. The list goes on.

“Indigenous peoples have always been on the front lines,” says Nikki Cooley, who grew up without electricity or running water on the Navajo Nation reservation and now co-manages the Tribes and Climate Change Program for the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP) in Flagstaff, Arizona. “Tribes have always been adapting to climate change. Now we have to adapt even faster.”

As Krosby puts it, indigenous peoples “have unique connections to the land and are feeling impacts the earliest and most severely.” One study found that coastal indigenous communities eat 15 times as much seafood as non-indigenous people in the same country — food that is being heavily impacted by everything from pollution to warming waters and ocean acidification. In the far north, buildings are collapsing and indigenous communities relocating as permafrost thaws, and traditional practices like reindeer herding are being threatened as winter snow changes to freezing rain, which locks up winter forage like lichens under ice.

“It’s happening all over the world,” says Brian Cladoosby, chairman of the Swinomish tribal community. “I have seen an elder standing on their cemetery in [the Pacific island nation of] Tuvalu and it was covered with water — they can’t bury their people there anymore.”

These are communities that have relied on the land for generations, building an intimate knowledge of the natural cycles of plants, animals, and weather. Unlike the traditional Western worldview that humanity can and should seek dominion over the environment, indigenous populations tend to view humanity as part of an interconnected whole. “We knew if we impacted one part of the web, the whole thing could fall apart,” says Cladoosby.

Adds Cooley, “We put our non-human relatives first, meaning the trees, the sky, the water. We don’t treat them as objects to be studied in a lab. We revere them.”

Indigenous communities also tend to think many generations ahead when planning how to utilize resources — a lot further than a U.S. presidential cycle allows. “America can’t even think past 4 years,” says Don Sampson, Umatilla Tribe member and head of the climate change project for the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians (ATNI), a 57-tribe consortium. “It’s a short-sighted country.”

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent reports have acknowledged with “high confidence” that adaptation efforts benefit from the inclusion of local and indigenous knowledge. “One of the things that comes across really clearly is the fact that indigenous peoples are by far the most effective stewards of biodiversity,” says Krosby. “They do the best job.” One study showed, for example, that deforestation rates across the Amazon were two to three times lower in indigenous-held lands.

According to the UN Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, indigenous peoples hold or manage a disproportionate amount of formally protected areas and areas with low human impact: these groups occupy 28 percent of the planet’s land, but more than 40 percent of protected areas. In Canada, the government funded an Indigenous Guardians program in 2017, recognizing that First Nations communities are well placed to serve as stewards of the land.

Cooley estimates that ITEP has worked with representatives of some 300 of the 574 tribes in the United States and that there are now more than 50 tribal climate action plans in effect. “In the past five years, tribal climate action plans have exploded,” she says. Sampson’s goal is to ramp that up to 100 percent within five years: “We have to accelerate the ability and capacity of the tribes; we want all tribes to identify the impacts and have a plan for that.”

Sampson also notes that many tribes are making huge strides on energy independence, weaning themselves off fossil fuels to protect both the environment and their economic future: the Navajo nation, for example, long reliant on coal, has made big investments in solar power.

The Swinomish tribe makes its home in western Washington, on an island carved out by the narrow Swinomish Channel. The land is low and at risk from sea level rise: A five-foot increase this century — at the high-end of sea level rise estimates — could swamp more than 1,100 acres of the 10,000 acre reservation, including all its agricultural lands. Part of the Swinomish territory is particularly sacred as a fishing and shellfish gathering spot, says Cladoosby. “One year, just a normal tide, not a storm surge, covered up that area,” he recalls. “That had never happened before. It was eye opening for us.”

About half of the reservation’s acreage is forested, and so is at risk from wildfire, especially in a hotter, drier climate. The tribe has just over 1,000 members, many of them relying on “first foods” — from shellfish to deer — for their welfare. The surrounding Salish Sea has seen salmon populations crash mysteriously over the past 30 years; the impacts of climate change — including reduced stream flows and warmer stream temperatures — have been cited as one culprit. Dungeness crab and shellfish larvae are in some places literally dissolving from ocean acidification.

In the Skagit River Basin, a shift from snowfall to rain in the surrounding mountains is projected to boost winter river flow but reduce summer flow, drying up tributaries and making waters warmer just as salmon spawn in late summer and fall. “When there’s no water for the salmon to return to, that’s a serious problem,” says Cladoosby.

“There’ve been times I’ve been really negative looking forward,” says Joseph Williams, a Swinomish tribal senator with five children. “Things are looking pretty bleak, especially for our salmon.” But these projects, he says, are proving inspirational to the next generation, helping to bring people together. “As long as we keep our kids excited about taking care of our environment, things remain optimistic,” he says.

For the Swinomish, as for many indigenous groups, it makes little sense to talk about environmental health and human health separately; they are deeply intertwined, with community cohesion and traditional food security being equally vital. Resilience to sea level rise doesn’t just mean managing wetlands, but also combating feelings of despair. Work led by the Swinomish tribe’s environmental health analyst Jamie Donatuto and tribal historic preservation officer Larry Campbell has created a set of health indicators based on these cultural values. They hope this approach will help researchers across the world think beyond simple morbidity and mortality as the only important measures of welfare.

Such work is often done in collaboration with non-indigenous scientists and governments. The University of Washington’s Climate Impacts Group last year released a Tribal Climate Tool, developed in close partnership with relevant tribes, that highlights specific climate impacts expected in local regions — from the number of hot summer days to inches of rainfall expected in coming decades — so tribes can see what they are facing and make decisions about how to adapt.

A number of such organizations are pushing this work forward in collaboration with local tribes, including the U.S. Geological Survey’s regional Climate Adaptation Science Centers; Krosby is deputy director for the northwest division. And there’s the Pacific Northwest Tribal Climate Change Network, based at the University of Oregon, which partners with Sampson’s division at the ATNI. In October, ATNI’s climate summit in Seattle is expected to attract tribal leaders from across North America, as they work on a national tribal climate crisis agenda for 2020 and beyond. “It’s a revolution that’s happening,” says Sampson. “Watch the tribes: they are going to lead us.”

For Cladoosby, part of that revolution involves re-awakening traditional connections to the land, which have eroded in recent centuries. “Part of the assimilation policy was taking stewardship of the environment out of our hands,” he says, leaving many communities locked in a cycle of trauma and cultural loss, along with drug and alcohol abuse. “Part of breaking that cycle is getting back that respect for the environment.”

“Right now, we are taking baby steps,” says Cladoosby. The Swinomish are still collecting data, securing treaty rights, educating their own people and others, he says. Alongside efforts to adapt and ensure resilience in the face of local change, political activism is also a big part of the picture as it can prevent some development and ensure that tribes maintain control over their lands. He acknowledges it will take time to establish long-term sustainable solutions. “We live in a pollution-based economy; it is based on making money and polluting the landscape,” Cladoosby says. “Trying to change that mindset is like trying to turn a tanker. It doesn’t happen over night.”

1040,"Nursing and midwifery workforce issues are matters for both Commonwealth and state governments. As the major employer of nurses and midwives, the states and territories are primarily responsible for recruitment and retention. The Australian Government is responsible for funding the delivery of health services and for university education of nursing and midwifery students.231 The Commonwealth’s wider function in planning and investing in the nursing and midwifery workforce of Australia has only emerged relatively recently. Initially, the majority of funding and policy initiatives were directed through the Education portfolio driven by the transition of nursing to the tertiary education sector in the early 1980s. Later, investment through the Council of Australian Governments’ (COAG) 2006 Health Reform Agenda has resulted in a much broader role for the Commonwealth with the ability to impact on the workforce through education and training reform.

Historically, nursing education in Australia was public hospital based, with an apprenticeship style system whereby the students were paid under conditions which included full board and lodging. Gradually, regulatory bodies for nursing were established in each state and territory. This resulted in the introduction of minimum standards for both the theory and clinical components of nurse training and the accreditation of schools for general nursing education. These agencies or authorities also maintained a register of those who had met the required standards and were eligible to practice as registered nurses. Admittance to the register was controlled by state-based examination near the end of the training period.232

By the 1980s, many of the schools of nursing in the smaller, regional and rural hospitals had closed as they did not have the capacity to meet the stringent educational requirements of the state-based nursing registration boards. The 1980s had seen a rapid increase of technology in the health sector and this in turn placed demands on all health professionals to expand their scope of practice with the nursing curriculum increasing from 1,000 to 1,200 hours over the three years training period. When the registration boards proposed an increase to 1,500 hours in order to include the theoretical components necessary for a nurse to be educated to meet the increasing demands of health care, it rendered this type of education no longer viable outside of the larger metropolitan centres.

Ultimately, it was agreed by the majority of stakeholders that the delivery of a contemporary curriculum reflective of the changes in the health system could only be delivered in the tertiary education sector. The legislation to enable the transfer was passed on 24 August 1984. States and territories moved at various speeds in establishing timetables to implement the transfer. NSW moved quickly and had completed the transfer by 1987 while other jurisdictions embarked on programs to complete the transfer by 1991. Queensland was the last state to enact the reform finally commencing its transfer in 1991 with a three year completion date. All jurisdictions established teams to manage the process and there was an Inter-jurisdictional Committee established at the Commonwealth level.

During the period of transfer from 1985 to 1993 the funding of nursing in higher education was shared by the state and territory governments (75%) and the Commonwealth (25%).233 As part of the agreement for the transfer, the Commonwealth proceeded on a program of infrastructure grants to jurisdictions to provide nursing education facilities at universities. These facilities were mostly in the form of buildings for classrooms, clinical laboratories and offices. The state and territory health departments retained the funding used for hospital based nursing training or re-directed it to clinical supervisor positions in anticipation of the changed model of education and training. From 1 January 1994, the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for full public funding for tertiary nursing education.234

As discussed in Chapter 7, at present the qualifications and skill level required for registration or enrolment as a nurse reflect the various types of work and level of responsibility in the workplace. For registered nurses, a 3-year bachelor or postgraduate degree in nursing (or the equivalent) is usually required. This degree includes both theoretical and clinical aspects. Enrolled nurses usually work with registered nurses to provide patients with basic nursing care, doing less complex procedures than registered nurses. Enrolled nurses must have completed an appropriate vocational education and training (VET) course or equivalent, lasting between 1 and 2 years, providing a theoretical base as well as supervised clinical experience. At present, 1 year courses for enrolled nurses are being phased out.

Nurse practitioners also train as registered nurses but undergo additional tertiary education at Master’s degree level and training in nursing at an advanced level, in line with their additional responsibilities. Working autonomously in an advanced and extended clinical role, authorised nurse practitioners may perform some specified functions traditionally done by a medical practitioner, such as prescribing some medications, ordering diagnostic tests and making referrals when operating within approved guidelines. Nurse practitioners are currently a small group, with 731 registered in Australia in 2012, according to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.

The formalisation of midwifery training in Australia began with the Diploma of Midwifery issued by the Women’s Hospital in Melbourne from 1893, undertaken after ‘general’ nursing training.235 Transition to a degree based qualification began at Flinders University in Adelaide, which offered the first Bachelor of Midwifery for registered nurses in 1997.236 However, the traditional model of midwives possessing nursing qualifications has been altered in the last 15 years.

Direct entry midwifery degrees at undergraduate level are now available in most Australian states, with at least four such degrees planned or in existence since 1998. These new degrees differ in that they do not require pre-registration as a nurse to be accepted into the course, although alternative more streamlined pathways have been maintained for nurses who wish to obtain midwifery qualifications. Direct entry midwives, as with other midwives, must be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia to practise.

As of December 2010, under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme for funding of university places, nursing courses of study were listed as a national priority and specific purpose funding is available for nursing clinical placements.237 For students commencing in 2008, nursing was in the lowest band of HECS-HELP ‘national priority’ for student contributions.

From 1 January 2010, the maximum annual student contribution amount for commencing Commonwealth supported students undertaking nursing units of study increased from the 'national priority' rate to the Band 1 rate. This was due to the Bradley Review of Australian Higher Education which found that student demand was not impacted by lower student contribution incentives and recommended increasing the maximum student contribution for nursing study from the “national priority” rate of $4,249 to the Band 1 rate of $5,310 from 2012 and indexed.238 This has been implemented with an associated reduction in HELP debts for eligible nursing graduates who work in the nursing profession. A maximum reduction of $1,558.50 (indexed) is available for up to 5 years of eligible employment to encourage graduates to remain in the nursing workforce.

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reports that:
• In 2011, the total number of nurses and midwives registered in Australia was 326,669, a 6.8% increase since 2007 (305,834).
• Between 2007 and 2011, the number of nurses and midwives employed in nursing or midwifery increased by 7.7% from 263,331 (86.1% of registrations) to 283,577 (86.8% of registrations).
• Of these people employed in nursing and midwifery, 36,074 were midwives (including 1,517 people registered as midwives but not nurses), though only 15,523 reported working in midwifery as the principal area of their main job.239

Data on students completing courses leading to registration as a nurse from 2001 to 2011 have been provided by the Australian Government Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education. Figure iv.1 indicates that overseas student numbers have been increasing rapidly, doubling from 2005 to 2007 and doubling again from 2007 to 2011. Domestic graduates showed similar growth.

The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) assesses internationally qualified nurses and midwives against criteria that will align them with the requirements for Australian qualified applicants for registration, as specified in the NMBA’s registration standards and the board approved course accreditation standards.

Though New Zealand nurses and midwives registered with the Nursing Council of New Zealand and the Midwifery Council of New Zealand may apply for registration under the National Law, they are also eligible to apply for registration under the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement.

Registration for nurses and midwives is the responsibility of the NMBA. The NMBA replaced the previous state and territory nursing and midwifery boards on 1 July 2010 as part of the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (NRAS) for health professions. The NMBA operates as an independent authority and its functions include:
• handling of notifications and complaints in relation to the profession;
• assessing overseas trained practitioners who wish to practice in Australia; and

Under the NRAS, nurses can be registered in two divisions: registered nurse (Division 1) or enrolled nurse (Division 2). Midwife registrations have no division, though most midwives are also registered as nurses in Division 1 (registered nurses). The term 'registered nurse' has been preserved in the NRAS and in the preceding state systems even though enrolled nurses are, in fact, 'registered' to practice as enrolled nurses.

Registered nurses (Division 1) include registered nurses, registered midwives, direct entry midwives, nurse practitioners, and midwife practitioners. Enrolled nurses (Division 2) include enrolled nurses and enrolled nurses (mothercraft). To approve registration or enrolment, registration boards must be satisfied that the applicant has completed an appropriate nursing or midwifery course, is fit and competent to practise, has a state of health such that he or she can practise safely, and has sufficient command of the English language to ensure safe practice.

A national approach to registration and resourcing has permitted collection of national data for the first time, provided a platform for quality and safety and opened up new policy avenues such as nurse practitioner and midwife prescribing. The current data set is subject to many caveats in terms of accuracy, but most stakeholders agree that it represents a considerable advance on the material previously available for workforce planning.

In 1994, the Report of the National Review of Nurse Education in the Higher Education Sector (1994 and beyond) was released. The impetus for the review was the transfer of pre-registration nurse education to the tertiary education sector which was due for completion by the end of 1993. Recommendations of the review included: that mental health be included in the undergraduate nursing curriculum with the termination of direct entry mental health nursing programs, that AHMAC provide funding for centres for rural and remote areas nursing located in university schools of nursing or health science, and that infrastructure and support be provided for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nursing students and nursing students from a rural background.

In response to ongoing concerns about national nursing shortages and the adequacy of undergraduate training places, the National Review of Nursing Education was initiated in April 2001 by the then Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST). The aim of the Review (2002) was to examine the future nursing educational needs of the health, community and aged care system in Australia and to provide advice on appropriate education policy and funding frameworks.

The terms of reference included initial registered nurse preparation, enrolled nurse education, education for specialisation, continuing education and the relationship of nursing with other groups in the health workforce. The final ‘Our Duty of Care’ report was released in 2002 with 36 recommendations supporting three main strategies to address the issues arising from the review:

The DEST-led Review ran in conjunction with the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Inquiry into Nursing. The final Report ‘The Patient Profession: Time for Action’ was released in June 2002. Recommendation 12 was that the Commonwealth provide additional undergraduate nursing places to meet the workforce requirements set by the states. In the 2002-03 Budget, $26.3 million had been provided for up to 250 aged care nursing scholarships annually at rural and regional universities. The universities were responsible for marketing the scholarships and for making additional nursing places available.

As a result of the 2002 National Review of Nursing Education, the Commonwealth increased the amount of funding per place given to institutions for nursing in the 2003-04 Budget. This increased funding was directed towards the cost of clinical practice in nursing with an additional 210 nursing places funded in regional institutions which rose to 574 places by 2007 as students progressed through their courses.

In November 2003 the National Nursing and Nursing Education Taskforce (N3ET) was appointed to implement a number of recommendations from the ‘Our Duty of Care’ report. In essence the role of the taskforce was to drive major nursing education and workforce reforms with responsibilities for the recommendations assigned to the groups or organisations best positioned to take on that work. Key work referred to the taskforce included increasing Commonwealth funding for additional undergraduate university places, developing a national classification of nursing and midwifery specialties, promotion of a nationally consistent scope of practice and enhancing nursing leadership and management.

In response to the Productivity Commission’s 2005 Report, Australia’s Health Workforce, COAG announced a package of key health workforce reforms on 8 April 2006 which included $93 million over four years to fund 1,000 new higher education nursing places. The subsequent COAG 2008 Health and Hospital Workforce reform package built on the investments made under the COAG 2006 agenda. Also in 2008 the first Chief Commonwealth Nursing and Midwifery Officer was appointed, as a result of the commitment made by the Government in the 2007 election.
• A Health Reform package of $1.1 billion of Commonwealth funding was committed, of which $500 million was for additional funding for undergraduate clinical training, including increasing the clinical training subsidy to 30% for all health undergraduate places. The package also provided for the establishment of a national health workforce agency (Health Workforce Australia) and a health workforce statistical register to drive a more strategic long-term plan for the health workforce.

As part of the National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform, the Bringing Nurses Back into the Workforce program was announced on 15 January 2008. $39.4 million was committed over 5 years to provide 7,750 extra nurses and midwives in public and private hospitals and 1,000 nurses in residential aged care homes with the aim of supporting the nursing workforce by increasing workforce numbers, reducing the need for excess overtime and casual replacements and, in turn, allowing nurses to undertake more professional development.

However, this program was slow to demonstrate results and in the 2009-10 Budget funding was redirected to new measures aimed at ensuring the retention of the existing nursing workforce and increasing recruitment into the aged care sector. Eligible nurses who were already participating on 11 May 2010, continued to receive incentive payments under the Bringing Nurses Back initiative. No new applications were accepted beyond 11 May 2010.

In 2008, the Chief Nurse and Midwifery Officer, Dr Rosemary Bryant led the National Review of Maternity Services. It was conducted as part of the Government’s 2007 election commitment to provide a National Maternity Services Plan. The final report of the review – Improving Maternity Services in Australia – wasreleased in February 2009 and provided recommendations for the future of maternity services in Australia.

The Government responded to the report through the Improving Maternity Services Budget Package (2009-10), providing $120.5 million over four years. A range of initiatives have been funded to support the maternity services workforce, and specifically to make better use of the midwifery workforce in providing safe, high quality maternity care in Australia. In the development of the National Maternity Services Plan, states and territories were asked to make complementary commitments and investments, particularly around the provision of birthing centres and rural maternity units.
• A Government-supported professional indemnity insurance scheme for eligible, privately practising midwives working in collaboration with doctors;
• An expansion of the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program (MSOAP) to provide more services in rural and remote communities;
• Extra scholarships for GPs and midwives to expand the maternity workforce, particularly in rural and remote Australia with 20 scholarships available each year for midwives to obtain the formal qualifications needed to be able to provide Medicare-subsidised services and access to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS);
• An expansion and improvement of the existing National Pregnancy Telephone Counselling Helpline to deliver a new 24 hour, seven days a week telephone helpline and information service to provide women, their partners and families with greater access to maternity information and support before and after birth;
• Funding for improvements to national maternity data collection and for a small program of research aimed at improving the safety and quality of maternity services; and
• Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS) and PBS benefits for services provided by eligible, privately practising midwives, working in collaboration with doctors.

It is important to note that policies which increase nurses’ access to the MBS have evolved over time. Initially measures supported nurses through “for and on behalf of items” for specific tasks such as immunisation. Later initiatives included incentives paid to general practice through the Practice Incentives Program to take on a practice nurse, MBS access for mental health nurses through expended primary care items, or a non-MBS incentive to take on a mental health nurse.

Most recently, the measures flowing from the 2009-10 Budget give eligible nurse practitioners and midwives direct MBS and PBS access for the first time, allowing them to deliver a range of subsidised services in non-acute settings including primary care, aged care and rural and remote settings. This access is provided for by the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioner) Act 2010 and has been available from 1 November 2010.

Prior to the passage of the legislation, nurse practitioners (NPs) were already performing in an advanced nursing role and had been able to order certain tests and prescribe certain medications under existing state and territory legislation. The 2009 Budget measure did not enable NPs to provide services beyond their scope of practice but was aimed at enabling eligible NPs to provide certain services on a subsidised basis through the MBS and PBS.

Aged care reform was a 2010 election commitment of the Government, informed by the recommendations of the Productivity Commission’s Inquiry into Aged Care (2010). On 20 April 2012, a comprehensive 10 year package to reshape aged care was announced. Under the reform package, the Government will provide $1.2 billion over five years in additional funding to aged care providers who take steps to improve the terms and conditions of their workers (the Addressing Workforce Pressures Initiative). An Aged Care Workforce Compact has been developed by the Aged Care Strategic Workforce Advisory Group chaired by Commissioner Anne Gooley from Fair Work Australia.

The Aged Care Workforce Compact will improve the capacity of the aged care sector to attract and retain staff through:

On 19 October 2012, Commissioner Gooley presented her Final Report to the Government. The Strategic Workforce Advisory Group recognised that a clear distinction can be made between commitments for the sector as a whole that are best expressed in the Compact, and those which are more appropriately agreed by employers and employees through bargaining at the enterprise level. The report details areas of agreement and disagreement from the Advisory Group on the requirements to be met by providers in order to access the additional funding under the Addressing-workforce-pressure initiative.",mainstream

The modern understanding of the origins of species is based on the theories of Charles Darwin combined with a modern knowledge of genetics based on the work of Gregor Mendel. Darwin observed there is a certain amount of variation of traits or characteristics among the different individuals belonging to a population. Some of these traits confer fitness-they allow the individual organism that possesses them to survive in their environment better than other individuals who do not possess them and to leave more offspring. The offspring then inherit the beneficial traits, and over time the adaptive trait spreads through the population. In twentieth century, the development of the the science of genetics helped explain the origin of the variation of the traits between individual organisms and the way in which they are passed from generation to generation.

1050,"Drawing on a huge database of climate-recording objects from all over the world—including tree rings, cave formations, and ancient pollen trapped in lake mud—the study concludes that 98 percent of Earth’s surface experienced its hottest period of the past 2,000 years within living memory. That uniform heat spike “is unprecedented over the Common Era,” it says.

This latest finding may not surprise most climate scientists, who suspect that the planet is as hot now as it’s ever been in at least the past 125,000 years. But it may shock some politicians, who have downplayed modern-day climate change by talking about those past shifts. “The climate has always been changing. There has never been a time when the climate has not changed,” said Senator Marco Rubio at a Republican presidential debate in 2016.

To which the study replies: Sure. It just hasn’t changed like this.

In fairness, that wasn’t always clear. Decades ago, researchers talked about the past periods of climate change as global events. They cited the Little Ice Age, which began in roughly 1550 and ended around 1850, as an era when global temperatures fell everywhere. But this study—and work from other scholars—suggests that the Little Ice Age wasn’t global at all, and mostly lowered temperatures in western Europe and parts of North America.

“Traditionally, the understanding of climate over [the past 2,000 years] is that there were globally coherent periods of climate variability—that there was a cold period called the Little Ice Age, [or] that there was a warm period called the Medieval Climate Anomaly,” said Nathan Steiger, an author of the paper and a research scientist at Columbia, at a press conference this week. “What we show is that these periods weren’t globally coherent, as previously thought.”

Read: Are we living through climate change’s worst-case scenario?

What makes those older eras different from modern warming is coherence—that climate change is happening today just about everywhere at the same time. “That coherence cannot be explained by the natural variability of the climate system,” Steiger said. And it does not characterize any previous era.

“This study is another nail in the coffin of the idea of that there was a globally warm or cold period that fit tidily into a specific couple of centuries,” said Yarrow Axford, a climate scientist at Northwestern University, in an email. She was not involved in writing the new paper. The idea that the Little Ice Age or eras like it were uniform global events was “already dying within the scientific community,” she said, yet that idea remains “perennially popular with nonexperts who want to sow doubt about the significance of the dramatic and truly global warming that has occurred in the past century.”

Among the nonexperts who have tacitly embraced that idea: Donald Trump. The president has repeatedly brought up the fluctuating nature of the climate in order to downplay current change. “Something’s changing, and it’ll change back again,” he said on 60 Minutes last year.",mainstream
576,"There is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for everything. With each year, the axiom proves ever more true. ETFs have exploded in number, the field grown crowded with thousands of investment options. Each fund aims to offer a low-cost portfolio of assets, often linked together by theme, trend or other commonality.

Investors worried about climate change or cruelty to animals or both now have an ETF that caters to this theme: the U.S. Vegan Climate ETF (VEGN). The fund is provided by Beyond Investing and Beyond Advisors IC. Beyond Investing lists a Florida mailbox as its address, while Beyond Advisors IC is based in Jersey.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿

According to the fund's prospectus, it aims to ""address the concerns of vegans, animal lovers and environmentalists by avoiding investments in companies whose activities directly contribute to animal suffering, destruction of the natural environment and climate change.""﻿﻿ This puts the U.S. Vegan Climate ETF in a growing class of socially responsible funds.

To find index members, the U.S. Vegan Climate ETF starts with the Solactive U.S. Large Cap Index, which consists of approximately 500 companies. From there, the fund removes any company involved with animal testing, animal-derived products, animal farming and animals used in sports or entertainment. Also excluded are fossil fuel companies, those that burn fossil fuels for energy production, and any company with a significant carbon footprint or history of environmental destruction. Tobacco, military and defense companies are eliminated, along with companies tied to human rights abuses.﻿﻿

As of March 31, 2020, the U.S. Vegan Climate ETF held 268 companies weighted by market capitalization. Top holdings include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB).﻿﻿ The fund held approximately $18 million in assets as of May 2020.﻿﻿

A three-person team is responsible for curating the fund. They have prior ETF experience at Charles Schwab, BlackRock and State Street.﻿﻿

As is often the case with vegan alternatives to traditional products and services, investors can expect to pay a premium for their investment in the U.S. Vegan Climate ETF. The expense ratio is 0.60%, compared with an average cost of 0.40% for socially responsible ETFs.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿

Still, the focus on social responsibility is enough to draw many eager investors, including a high proportion of millennial investors looking to reap the rewards of investing without compromising their values. Nearly 100 socially responsible ETFs collectively hold assets of approximately $30 billion,﻿﻿ showing that investors as a group take this approach quite seriously.",mainstream
1013,"A highly qualified and experienced climate modeler with impeccable credentials has rejected the unscientific bases of the doom-mongering over a purported climate crisis. His work has not yet been picked up in this country, but that is about to change. Writing at the Australian site Quadrant, Tony Thomas introduces the English-speaking world to the truth-telling of Dr. Mototaka Nakamura (hat tip: Andrew Bolt, John McMahon).

There’s a top-level oceanographer and meteorologist who is prepared to cry “Nonsense!”on the “global warming crisis” evident to climate modellers but not in the real world. He’s as well or better qualified than the modellers he criticises — the ones whose Year 2100 forebodings of 4degC warming have set the world to spending $US1.5 trillion a year to combat CO2 emissions. The iconoclast is Dr. Mototaka Nakamura. In June he put out a small book in Japanese on “the sorry state of climate science”. It’s titled Confessions of a climate scientist: the global warming hypothesis is an unproven hypothesis, and he is very much qualified to take a stand. From 1990 to 2014 he worked on cloud dynamics and forces mixing atmospheric and ocean flows on medium to planetary scales. His bases were MIT (for a Doctor of Science in meteorology), Georgia Institute of Technology, Goddard Space Flight Centre, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Duke and Hawaii Universities and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology. He’s published about 20 climate papers on fluid dynamics. [i] Today’s vast panoply of “global warming science” is like an upside down pyramid built on the work of a few score of serious climate modellers. They claim to have demonstrated human-derived CO2 emissions as the cause of recent global warming and project that warming forward. Every orthodox climate researcher takes such output from the modellers’ black boxes as a given.

Dr. Nakamura has just made his work available to the English-speaking world:

And the critique he offers is comprehensive.

Now Nakamura has found it again, further accusing the orthodox scientists of “data falsification” by adjusting previous temperature data to increase apparent warming “The global surface mean temperature-change data no longer have any scientific value and are nothing except a propaganda tool to the public,” he writes. The climate models are useful tools for academic studies, he says. However, “the models just become useless pieces of junk or worse (worse in a sense that they can produce gravely misleading output) when they are used for climate forecasting.” The reason: These models completely lack some critically important climate processes and feedbacks, and represent some other critically important climate processes and feedbacks in grossly distorted manners to the extent that makes these models totally useless for any meaningful climate prediction. I myself used to use climate simulation models for scientific studies, not for predictions, and learned about their problems and limitations in the process.

Climate forecasting is simply impossible, if only because future changes in solar energy output are unknowable. As to the impacts of human-caused CO2, they can’t be judged “with the knowledge and technology we currently possess.” # A complete lack of meaningful representations of aerosol changes that generate clouds. # Lack of understanding of drivers of ice-albedo (reflectivity) feedbacks: “Without a reasonably accurate representation, it is impossible to make any meaningful predictions of climate variations and changes in the middle and high latitudes and thus the entire planet.” # Arbitrary “tunings” (fudges) of key parameters that are not understood Concerning CO2 changes he says, I want to point out a simple fact that it is impossible to correctly predict even the sense or direction of a change of a system when the prediction tool lacks and/or grossly distorts important non-linear processes, feedbacks in particular, that are present in the actual system … … The real or realistically-simulated climate system is far more complex than an absurdly simple system simulated by the toys that have been used for climate predictions to date, and will be insurmountably difficult for those naïve climate researchers who have zero or very limited understanding of geophysical fluid dynamics. I understand geophysical fluid dynamics just a little, but enough to realize that the dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans are absolutely critical facets of the climate system if one hopes to ever make any meaningful prediction of climate variation. Solar input, absurdly, is modelled as a “never changing quantity”. He says, “It has only been several decades since we acquired an ability to accurately monitor the incoming solar energy. In these several decades only, it has varied by one to two watts per square metre. Is it reasonable to assume that it will not vary any more than that in the next hundred years or longer for forecasting purposes? I would say, No.”

941,"We've been living in a dream. We climb into jet planes and fly across continents, never giving the accomplishment a second thought. We drive to grocery stores, assuming the shelves will be stocked with endless boxes of food. And every day we plug our devices into the wall, sure that electricity will flow from the outlet. Other than the occasional hurricane or earthquake, we have lived our whole lives taking for granted that this thing we call ""civilization"" was a machine that could never fail.

It's time to wake up.

The international COVID-19 pandemic is many things, but its deepest impact may be fostering a recognition that this machine of civilization that we built is a whole lot more fragile than we thought. And that is why, in the long term, the coronavirus will one day be seen as a fire drill for climate change.

To understand the powerful connection between this pandemic and climate change, we must understand exactly what ""modern civilization"" means from a scientific point of view. For researchers, the global high-tech society we've built over the last 100 years is actually a series of networks laid on top of one another.

Thanks to Facebook, we're all familiar with what ""social networks"" look like: the links we have to our friends and then their friends and then their friends expanding outward to make a vast spider's web of connections. Modern civilization is a delicate layer cake of such networks, one stacked on top of each other.

The transportation network — roads, trains, ships and airplanes — moves our goods around. Energy networks — electric grids, oil and natural gas pipelines — deliver power where and when it's needed. Economic networks — banks, investment firms and brokers — keep money for trade circulating. And, as we are coming to see in stark relief, there's the health care network — doctors, nurses and hospitals — that manages the endless stream of sickness and injury.

So how robust or resilient are these networks? If you kick them hard, will they still function? COVID-19 is exposing just how complacent we've been in answering that question. Health officials across the country are watching in horror and desperation as their network gets overwhelmed. The fear the pandemic has caused is already pushing on the food distribution and economic networks.

Suddenly all of these systems that were invisible just a month ago are standing in front of us in sharp relief. Some are even blinking red with warning. The warnings must be taken seriously, as studies of multilayered networks show they can be fragile: Breaking links in one network cascades through the others like a fragmenting bullet ripping through a complex machine.

So what does any of this have to do with climate change? Like this pandemic, climate change is also going to push on the networks that make up our civilization. Unlike the pandemic, its effects will be long term, and there won't be a vaccine that can save us.

When most of us think about climate change, we visualize changes to the planet: soaring temperatures, rising oceans, melting ice caps. That's hard enough to imagine on a global scale. But where our imaginations really fail is in asking what will happen to us, to daily human life, and that is a question about the invisible civilization networks. Climate change will mean one emergency after another, year after year, as heat waves, floods, fire and storms blow cascades of failures through our systems.

If I asked you just a few weeks ago to imagine what that would look like, what it would feel like, to see those networks stressed, you'd probably point to some Hollywood science fiction movie. Today, you just have to turn on the news. Now we know firsthand the dread that follows when these systems are threatened.

For all its uncertainty, the pandemic comes as no surprise to those who study infectious diseases. For years, they used their science to map out the effect of a novel virus' appearance. For years, they warned us that we needed to be prepared. The magnitude of that warning was not heeded, and now we are all paying the price.

As with the threat of a pandemic, scientists who study climate change have been warning for decades that we are unprepared for what lies just over the horizon. Using the same kinds of mathematical tools deployed by epidemiologists, they have predicted the course of global warming, laid out its potential effects on the networks that make up civilization and told us what needs to be done to avoid calamity.

Examples of threats these scientists worry about range from the disruption of global supply chains due to increasingly extreme weather, to failures of food production and distribution networks as climate patterns shift, to failure of investment networks as risk assessment and getting insurance become more difficult.

But in response, these warnings have been politicized. Those who deny the science claim it's specious and there's no need to worry. Of course, that's what many of them said about COVID-19 just a few weeks ago. But our government had enough warning that it could have begun stockpiling essential equipment and preparing the health care system for the shock that was sure to come.

In the same way, we've had decades of warnings about what is needed to deal with climate change, such as by shifting investments in the energy networks away from fossil fuels. And, as with the pandemic, we're ignoring all the warnings. Even some people who believe climate change is coming ignore the warnings and continue to live in areas where fires and floods will increase.

The good news about the pandemic is that we'll make it through this. It will take a few months, but we will emerge with our networks intact, and we will be wiser for the experience. The good news is also that there is still time to deal with climate change. Now that we have seen what breaking the networks — the machine — of civilization can look like, we must stop pretending that everything will be OK and that we can just go back to business as usual when the threat of the coronavirus subsides.

The pandemic has awakened us from our slumber. It is letting us see the real consequences of denial. That may be its most important lesson — allowing us the insight, strength and compassion to build a resilient and robust future.",mainstream

• How could climate change affect the East Midlands?
• What are you, the Council, doing about climate change?
• How is the Council adapting services to tackle climate change?
• How can I get more information on climate change and what I can do to help?

On 22nd May 2019, Derby City Council declared a Climate Emergency in the city. The decision was unanimous across all parties, at the Council’s AGM.

The council was asked to to:
• Establish a Derby Climate Change working group to respond to this challenge
• Consider recommendations from the proposed working group, and set a target for Derby to be carbon neutral
• Work with other local authorities and public, private and voluntary sector partners on carbon reduction projects to ensure the UK is able to deliver on its climate commitments
• Ensure the Government provides the necessary resources and powers so that Derby can make its contribution to the UK’s Carbon Reduction targets

Derby is one of nearly 90 councils in the UK that have passed climate emergency motions so far. In May 2019, the UK Parliament followed the lead of these local councils, unanimously approving a motion to declare a climate emergency and calling on the Government to increase its ambition to adopt more ambitious targets for reaching net zero emissions.

As a local authority we will determine how we rise to this challenge – that means taking stock of where we are now, and where we need to be. Work on that has already begun, but in order for this target to be achievable, everyone across our city must come together to work towards this common goal.

The task is monumental, but to help in safeguarding our planet, it’s necessary.

'Climate change' refers to changes in the earth's climate that are caused by increasing levels of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO ) in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases cause the earth to heat up, which affects global weather patterns, sea levels and the frequency of extreme weather events. Human activities have contributed to increasing levels of greenhouse gases - especially the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, which release CO into the atmosphere.

In order to reduce the challenges posed by climate change, we must reduce the amount of CO carbon dioxide) we produce. This can be achieved by making simple changes to our day to day lives, like using less energy, driving less and recycling more.

We also need to prepare for the changes in our climate (adaptation) and by taking positive action we can take advantage of opportunities.

How could climate change affect the East Midlands?

In the most recent State of the UK Climate 2017 report, trends show that the UK climate is continuing to warm and that sea levels continue to rise. But what does that mean?
• We will be experiencing summers that are 2.5ºC warmer, with daily summer highs 3.3ºC warmer. This is about the same difference as you would expect to see between Glasgow and London on an average August day.
• Our winters will be milder with the average temperatures being 2.2°C warmer.
• There may be a 16% decrease in summer rainfall making our summers much drier.
• Winters will be wetter with an average of 14% more rainfall.
• Mean sea level around the UK has risen by about 16cm since the start of the 20th century.

For more information, visit the UK Climate Projections website.

What is the Council doing about climate change?

Several years ago, we developed a Climate Change Strategy to address the climate change impacts of our activities. A lot has changed since this was developed, and while we are working to this strategy it’s in need of a refresh.

We continue to look every day at ways in which we can reduce our carbon emissions through auditing our own estates and services, domestic properties, transport and industry.

As a local authority we report on greenhouse gas emissions and work is carried out across the Council to reduce emissions from our estate and operations.

Our carbon footprint is generated by monitoring our carbon emissions, taking into account:
• energy use and travel data from contractors which provide services to, or on behalf of, the Council.

Greenhouse gas emissions data (in tonnes of CO₂) for period 1 April to 31 March

These greenhouse gas emission figures are calculated based on guidance provided by Defra.

Emissions that have decreased from the baseline year include those from:

Overall analysis of the greenhouse gas emission data shows a continued decline in CO levels each year since 2008-09. This has lead to the lowest recorded annual CO levels in 2011-12 with a decline of 29% from the baseline level of 42904 tonnes of CO₂e in 2008-09 to 30608 tonnes of CO₂e in 2011-12.

For more detail on these figures please see the Greenhouse Gas Emission Report.

For information on what the government is doing to reduce UK's carbon emissions, visit The Department of Energy and Climate Change website.

How is the Council adapting services to tackle climate change?

It is important for us to to consider how we will adapt to future changes in our climate. This will allow us to both minimise the potential of harmful impacts and take advantage of any beneficial impacts.

Harmful impacts can include heatwaves in Derby like we experienced in 2003, or the severe snow experienced in 2010.

Beneficial impacts can include a boost to tourism or growing new food crops that require a longer, warmer growing season.

To ensure we are able to adapt our services to the changing climate, we have been working with other East Midlands local authorities through Climate East Midlands on the Planning to Adapt Project.

So far we have:
• produced a Local Climate Impacts Profile (LCLIP) for Derby. This shows how severe weather events have affected us between 2000 and 2008
• conducted a climate risk assessment for each of our services to determine the severity of risks and potential opportunities that will arise as a result of climate change
• done research with partners throughout the East Midlands to assess the risks and find out more about the changes we could make to reduce those risks
• organised free events and workshops on adapting to a changing climate

We have taken part in a regional programme called Well Adapting East Midlands (WAEM). This project looked at ways that we, and our partners, can become more resilient to extreme weather and better adapt to the future climate.

As part of this we have produced a case study of one of Derby's key risk area, flooding. This details what plans are in place to improve flood defences along the river Derwent as it passes through the city.

Find out more on how we are preparing the city for extreme flooding events.

488,"Provides students with a solid foundation in climate science, with which to understand global warming, natural climate variations, and climate models. As climate models are one of our primary tools for predicting and adapting to climate change, it is vital we appreciate their strengths and limitations. Also key is understanding what aspects of climate science are well understood and where quantitative uncertainties arise. This textbook will inform the future users of climate models and the decision-makers of tomorrow by providing the depth they need, while requiring no background in atmospheric science and only basic calculus and physics. Developed from a course that the author teaches at UCLA, material has been extensively class-tested and with online resources of colour figures, Powerpoint slides, and problem sets, this is a complete package for students across all sciences wishing to gain a solid grounding in climate science.

""This is a timely and important book that lucidly and engagingly covers topics related to climate change, topics that currently receive enormous attention and that unfortunately cause polarization."" - Professor S. George Philander, Princeton University

""David Neelin’s book is a very valuable and accessible textbook for students of climate science, and all those with an interest in climate modeling. It is a thorough and highly readable book that neatly spans the gap between general interest climate change texts and higher-level books for specialists."" - Dr. Drew Shindell, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies

""This book presents the diverse subjects of climate modeling and climate variability in a way that is clear and understandable to students from different backgrounds. The author is a world-famous climate scientist who has been highly successful both in research and teaching, covering all of the theoretical, modeling and data analysis aspects of climate science. The book is based on a course he has been teaching at UCLA for many years, which has been extremely popular and highly valued by students from a variety of disciplines. I am sure that the book will soon become the standard textbook on climate modeling and climate change."" - Professor Akio Arakawa, University of California, Los Angeles

""If you're looking for an up-to-date text that deals with the science of climate change and climate modelling in a way that is both rigorous and accessible, then this book is for you. This timely treatment of a vitally important topic presents a novel integration of climate system science, including variability and change, with the fundamental principles of climate modelling and its applications that is accurate, informative and useful in a range of contexts. The book is structured to provide engaging material for both those interested in engaging with the complex science of climate change, and those whose focus is on developing a broader understanding to apply in areas such as ecology, engineering or policy. Neelin's book will be a valuable addition to my library and mandatory reading for my students."" - Dr Janette Lindesay, Australian National University

""With the looming prospect of serious climate change at hand, it is ever more important to interest the best and brightest minds in the challenging problems of climate science. But those of us who teach climate science have been handicapped by the lack of a comprehensive and engaging text. With his masterful Climate Change and Climate Modeling, David Neelin has answered our prayers."" - Professor Kerry A. Emanuel, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

""Overall, this book is a positive addition to the library shelf. It is well written, clear, and accessible and fits nicely in between A. Gill's rather more cerebral Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics and K. McGuffie and A. Henderson-Sellers's practical but somewhat dated A Climate Modelling Primer. As a textbook, Climate Change is not inexpensive, but for a beginning student in this field it will likely repay the investment."" EOS

""text is generally well written and demonstrates the ability of the author to explain a wide range of concepts...a welcome addition to the set of introductory climate science books and should be especially valuable for students.."" - Paul A.

264,"(CNN) The proportion of Americans who are ""alarmed"" by global warming tripled over the last five years and is now at an all-time high, a new survey shows .

Almost 6 in 10 Americans are either ""alarmed"" or ""concerned"" by global warming , marking what researchers say is a major shift in public perception of the issue.

The survey was conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication, which together have tracked Americans' views on climate change since 2008.

As recently as 2014, the percentage of Americans categorized as ""dismissive"" of global warming was roughly the same as those who were ""alarmed"" -- around 11 to 12%.

But in the years since, the ranks of the ""dismissive"" -- those who believe global warming is not happening or caused by humans -- has fallen to just 10%.

Over the same time, the ""alarmed"" group -- people who are most worried about global warming and support measures to reduce heat-trapping carbon pollution -- grew to 31% of those surveyed, and today outnumber the dismissive crowd by more than 3-to-1.

The findings show that as the global climate changes rapidly, a growing proportion of Americans view the climate crisis as an actual crisis.

Indeed, the shift in public opinion hasn't yet been translated into meaningful policy at the federal level, says Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication who co-led the survey.

""The overall trend is a major shift in the political climate of climate change in this country, but in terms of (the 'alarmed') exerting its full political force, it is yet to do so because it is still relatively unorganized,"" he said.

As for what could be behind the shift, Leiserowitz says there are a number of likely factors.

One, he says, is the science.

The impact of increased news media coverage also can't be ignored, Leisorowitz says.

""The media as a whole, when it doesn't talk about the issue, the issue fades from public awareness and concern,"" he said.

Then, there are the increasing number of extreme weather disasters that have directly impacted many Americans.

Climate change has made many of these events more likely and more destructive. Reporters and public figures are helping people to connect the dots, Leiserowitz says.

""These horrific, catastrophic disasters that Americans are experiencing right now need to be interpreted for people to really understand,"" he said. ""And what we're seeing is that when many Americans see these things in their backyards or on their television screens, they're starting to ask, 'What the hell is going on with the weather?'""",mainstream
323,"Global negotiations on stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions in the period after 2012 will commence in Bali in December. The main emitters—including Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Mexico, South Africa and the U.S.—have recently affirmed their commitment to reach a “comprehensive agreement” in these negotiations. They have also promised to contribute their “fair share” to stabilize greenhouse gases to prevent “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”

Of course, one of the biggest obstacles, if not the very biggest, to such an international agreement has been the U.S. itself. The U.S. not only has failed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol—the international framework to limit emissions up to the year 2012—but also has failed to put forward any meaningful stabilization strategy in its place. One of the most shocking aspects of the U.S. failure has been the country’s disregard for both international and domestic law. Yet this lawlessness looks set to change.

In recent years the unilateralist foreign policy of the U.S. government has shamelessly ignored or contravened countless aspects of international law, ranging from the Geneva convention to multilateral environmental treaties to which the U.S. is a signatory.

This brazenness has infected the very core of policy discussions in our country. Consider an opinion piece by two distinguished professors of law at the University of Chicago, who argued in the Financial Times on August 5 that the U.S. has no obligations to control greenhouse gases and that if other countries don’t like how the U.S. behaves, they might think about paying the U.S. to cut its emissions.

Stunningly, the law professors completely neglected that the U.S. is already bound to take steps to stabilize greenhouse gases in the atmosphere under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by President George H. W. Bush and ratified by the Senate in 1992. Their claim that the U.S. has no duty to avoid damaging the climate of others is flatly contradicted by the Convention, which declares in its preamble that “in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law…. [States have] the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.”

Ironically, those law professors are running away from international law even faster than the Bush administration. John B. Bellinger III, a legal adviser to the State Department, recently emphasized the administration’s commitment to international law and referred to its allegiance to a post-2012 climate change framework in that context.

The Supreme Court also weighed in recently to affirm that U.S. domestic law compels stronger federal action to mitigate climate change. Massachusetts, among a number of plaintiffs, sued the Environmental Protection Agency for its failure to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide by automobiles. The court firmly struck down all the EPA’s defenses for inaction: it noted that the EPA is obliged to regulate any deleterious pollutant emitted by motor vehicles; that carbon dioxide clearly falls within that category; that Massachusetts had standing to sue because climate change was already claiming part of the state’s coastline; and that the state was vulnerable to considerably greater coastal losses this century if climate change is not mitigated. Moreover, it emphasized that mitigating U.S. auto emissions would have a meaningful effect on the pace of climate change.

The obligation to limit greenhouse gas emissions is therefore already the law of the land, and it’s high time we began respecting those laws. We should do so not only because it is important that we honor our legal commitments but because we made those commitments for reasons of our own survival and well-being. Even an administration that has dragged its feet for seven years is finally beginning to face that reality.",mainstream
774,"A substantial rise in sea levels, oppressive summer temperatures, widespread droughts, increasingly severe storms, and disastrous floods. These are all potentially dramatic affects resulting from climate change phenomena. For many investors, climate change may be easily overlooked with little concern to their portfolio but for those on top of the world’s climate change developments, several special considerations may be needed.

Investing concerns over climate change fall within the realms of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, which has been expanding in research and offerings. Institutional investment managers have been carving out a broader niche to provide more opportunities for those investors with concerns over corporate governance, sin stocks, and more. ESG also heavily encompasses investing for the good of the environment. That’s often where the affects of climate change can come in for environmentally concerned investors.

Climate change is a complex, multi-dimensional evolution that can affect the global environmental climate in many ways. It is generally the result of various types of emissions fostered from large corporations in their operational practices. Governments across the globe have taken steps to curb, monitor, and/or regulate large corporate practices in this area to help handle the problem.

Globally, the United Nations is one of the leading providers of research on global climate change affects. Its December 2019 Special Report on Climate Change and Land looks at several key aspects of climate change and climate change affects across the globe including food safety, greenhouse gases, and more.

In the United States, the National Climate Assessment, mandated every four years by the Global Change Research Act of 1990, is one the most authoritative research pieces. The 2018 report covers the areas of:

While these two research pieces are extensive, they can be great sources of information for those looking to groom a portfolio for climate change. Broadly, the implications of climate change can be multi-dimensional, potentially affecting everyone’s lives, finances, and environmental experiences.

For those looking to tailor some or all of their portfolio thematically around climate change there can be several options. Two of the most well known routes include renewable energy investments and investing in corporations with green initiatives.

Developments in renewable energy are one byproduct of the world’s interests in preserving the climate and limiting the amount of unhealthy emissions. Renewable energy companies focus on manufacturing products and creating solutions that limit or eliminate emissions.

If you’re willing to jump in the market, solar technology remains an up-and-coming area in the alternative energy sector. Solar offers the use of sunlight as a means for energy generation, helping to supplement the need for electricity or gases. Rival Chinese manufacturers Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) and Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) are leaders in the global solar segment. The Market Vectors Solar Energy ETF (KWT) and Guggenheim Solar Fund (TAN) are both globally diversified options in managed funds.

Among North American solar outfits, Tempe, Ariz.-based First Solar, Inc. (FSLR), which provides photovoltaic solar systems to the international market, is a top choice. There is also, Guelph, Ontario-based Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ), which is a leader in the Canadian market.

On the institutional front, there are also several managers taking big bets on the profitable returns of the renewable energy sectors. One of the most prominent is the Calvert Global Energy Solutions Fund. Across the market, several indexes and index funds also exist.

Across the globe, green tech investing has been important for many nations of the world. The Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2019 lays out investments across the last decade by type of technology and country.

Many diversified green ETFs have also been created to follow these trends including Wheaton, Ill.-based First Trust ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index Fund (FCG) and the iPath Global Carbon ETN (GRN).

Those interested in exploring the renewables sector farther afield would do well to look to China, which has by far outpaced the rest of the world with its renewable energy investments. From 2010 through the first half of 2019 China reported $758 billion in renewable energy investments, beating out all of Europe at $698 billion and nearly doubling the United States in the second place ranking at $356 billion. However, the high level of investment also coincides with a high level of emissions, particularly in the areas of carbon and coal, which also is a concern.

Companies with substantial green energy initiatives and investments can also be a great place to invest for a climate change targeted portfolio. Investing in green energy projects has long been seen as a risky proposition: the high capital investment in complex infrastructure for wind, solar, and biomass technology has meant that for green companies, expenditures have often outweighed profits. However, many companies see the need for this important investment and have taken steps to set themselves and the environment up for a better future.

The STOXX Global Climate Change Leaders Index was developed to recognize the top global companies on the A-list for green initiatives. Heavy weights in the Index include: Apple, Bank of America, Microsoft, and Alphabet.

For many investors, a climate change focused portfolio can also mean avoiding companies with high levels of emissions. Oftentimes this includes oil, gas, and chemical companies which rely on high chemical usage for their production.

Broadly, investors in renewables should take a long view and cast a wide net. From an investment perspective, these investments may have a tough yardstick: returns on investments are held against comparable expenditures generated by traditional energy sources like coal or oil, which still remain highly profitable. Moreover, renewable and green tech investments can take years to payoff leaving investors to hope more for the long term rather than short term results.

Beyond just basic portfolio investing, climate change conscious investors may also want to make some personal finance considerations as well. For the more extremely climate change conscious, many experts suggest holding a hoard of at least $1,000 in cash in your home in the case of an emergency environmental evacuation. Along these lines, holding a larger portion of your total portfolio in cash is also suggested to combat any times of extreme crisis or market losses related to environmental, climate issues.

Beyond higher levels of cash holdings, some other considerations may be top of mind as well. Insurance, energy, and property values are likely to be affected in areas highly vulnerable to climate change affects. Food and health care costs can also be a concern. Job security can also be a factor for many who work in industries that could be negatively affected by climate change developments.

Investing for climate change has many of its own special considerations. The economies of the world can't simply go cold turkey on hydrocarbons overnight but supporting the commitment to replacing some traditional energy investments with renewables can be a good first step. Investing in companies that are making strong headway in the fight to go green and turn higher profits is also a good decision. Beyond that, staying aware of how climate change is affecting the region you live in and its costs can also be very important for managing your current lifestyle and planning for your future into the retirement years.",mainstream
542,"veryone faces choices every day that carry a climate cost. Do we turn the lights on in the morning, or is the light of daybreak sufficient for finding matching socks? Do we feast on bacon and eggs for breakfast, or will a bowl of oatmeal suffice? There is a lot of talk these days about the need to lead lower-carbon lifestyles. There is also a lot of finger-pointing going on and, some argue, virtue signaling. But who is truly walking the climate walk? The carnivore who doesn’t fly? The vegan who travels to see family abroad? If nobody is without carbon sin, who gets to cast the first lump of coal? If all climate advocates were expected to live off the grid, eating only what they could grow themselves and wearing only the clothes they’d knitted from scratch, there wouldn’t be much of a climate movement. That level of sacrifice is unacceptable to most.

We don’t need to ban cars; we need to electrify them (and we need that electricity to come from clean energy). We don’t need to ban burgers; we need climate-friendly beef. To spur these changes, we need to put a price on carbon, to incentivize polluters to invest in these solutions. Though air travel accounts for only a paltry 2% of global emissions, whether or not climate scientists should fly consumes far more than 2% of my Twitter timeline. Unfortunately, sometimes doing science means traveling great distances, and we don’t always have the time or luxury to take slower low-carbon options. We have a job to do, after all. But even still, a single scientist, or even hundreds of scientists, choosing to never fly again is not going to change the system. Purchasing carbon offsets for flights is a viable means of decarbonizing your air travel, for now. However, the true solution, pricing carbon, requires policy change.

There is a long history of industry-funded “deflection campaigns” aimed to divert attention from big polluters and place the burden on individuals. Individual action is important and something we should all champion. But appearing to force Americans to give up meat, or travel, or other things central to the lifestyle they’ve chosen to live is politically dangerous: it plays right into the hands of climate-change deniers whose strategy tends to be to portray climate champions as freedom-hating totalitarians.

The bigger issue is that focusing on individual choices around air travel and beef consumption heightens the risk of losing sight of the gorilla in the room: civilization’s reliance on fossil fuels for energy and transport overall, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of global carbon emissions. We need systemic changes that will reduce everyone’s carbon footprint, whether or not they care. The good news is we have tactics to bring environmentally friendly (and non-lifestyle-disrupting) options to fruition­: pricing carbon emissions and creating incentives for renewable energy and reduced consumption. By putting a price on carbon, people can actually make money by reducing emissions, selling their services to corporations that are always looking for ways to cut costs. Never underestimate the resourcefulness of Americans when there’s a dime to be made! But a price on carbon needs to be designed such that marginalized communities most at risk from climate impacts aren’t adversely impacted economically as well.

This is why we really need political change at every level, from local leaders to federal legislators all the way up to the President. We need change not just at the breakfast table, but at the ballot box as well.

Does climate change affect the transmission of coronavirus?

We don’t have direct evidence that climate change is influencing the spread of COVID-19, but we do know that climate change alters how we relate to other species on Earth and that matters to our health and our risk for infections.

As the planet heats up, animals big and small, on land and in the sea, are headed to the poles to get out of the heat. That means animals are coming into contact with other animals they normally wouldn’t, and that creates an opportunity for pathogens to get into new hosts.

Many of the root causes of climate change also increase the risk of pandemics. Deforestation, which occurs mostly for agricultural purposes, is the largest cause of habitat loss worldwide. Loss of habitat forces animals to migrate and potentially contact other animals or people and share germs. Large livestock farms can also serve as a source for spillover of infections from animals to people. Less demand for animal meat and more sustainable animal husbandry could decrease emerging infectious disease risk and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

We have many reasons to take climate action to improve our health and reducing risks for infectious disease emergence is one of them.

Does air pollution increase the risk of getting coronavirus? Does it make symptoms worse?

Recent research from Rachel Nethery, Xiauo Wu, Francesca Dominici and other colleagues at Harvard Chan has found that people who live in places with air quality are more likely to die from COVID-19 even when accounting for other factors that may influence risk of death such as pre-existing medical conditions, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare.

This finding is consistent with prior research that has shown that people who are exposed to more air pollution and who smoke fare worse with respiratory infections than those who are breathing cleaner air, and who don’t smoke.

In places where air pollution is a routine problem, we have to pay particular attention to individuals who may be more exposed or vulnerable than others to polluted air, such as the homeless, those who don’t have air filtration in their homes, or those whose health is already compromised. These individuals may need more attention and support than they did even before coronavirus came along.

For those interested in research papers on air pollution and virus transmission:
• 
• 
• Exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 mortality in the United States (Harvard University, preprint, 2019). This study found that a small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in COVID-19 death rate.
• Measuring the impact of air pollution on respiratory infection risk in China (Environmental Pollution, 2018). This study found that worse air quality in China may increase transmission of infections that cause influenza-like illnesses.
• The association between respiratory infection and air pollution in the setting of air quality policy and economic change (Annals of the American Thoracic Society, 2019). A study of nearly 500,000 New York residents found that higher particulate matter air pollution levels increased the chances of hospitalization for pneumonia and emergency deparment visits, especially for influenza.
• Airborne transmission may have played a role in the spread of 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in the United States (Scientific Reports, 2019). Researchers have found that several viruses, including adenovirus and influenza virus, can be carried on air particles. This recent paper finds that particulate matter likely contributed to the spread of the 2015 avian influenza.
• Relationship between ambient air pollution and daily mortality of SARS in Beijing (Biomedical and Environmental Sciences, 2005). During the SARS epidemic in 2003, this study found that increases in particulate matter air pollution increased risks of dying from the disease. SARS is a coronavirus, like COVID-19.

Will warmer weather slow the spread of coronavirus?

We don’t yet have a sense of what the changing weather will mean for COVID-19 and so we shouldn’t rely upon warmer weather to curtail transmissions. We need to do everything we can right now to slow the spread of this disease, and that means we need to follow the advice that public health experts are telling us and practice social distancing and good hand hygiene, among other actions.

How likely are we to see infectious disease spread as a result of climate change?

Climate change has already made conditions more favorable to the spread of some infectious diseases, including Lyme disease, waterborne diseases such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus which causes vomiting and diarrhea, and mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Future risks are not easy to foretell, but climate change hits hard on several fronts that matter to when and where pathogens appear, including temperature and rainfall patterns. To help limit the risk of infectious diseases, we should do all we can to vastly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.

Why are emerging infectious diseases on the rise?

We have seen a trend of greater emergence of infectious diseases in recent decades. Most of these diseases have entered into people from animals, especially wild animals. This trend has many causes. We have massive concentrations of domesticated animals around the world, some of which can be home to pathogens, like the flu, that can make people sick. We also have massive concentrations of people in cities where diseases transmitted by sneezing may find fertile ground. And we have the ability to travel around the globe in less than a day and share germs widely.

But a look at the origins of COVID reveals that other forces may be in play. In the past century we have escalated our demands upon nature, such that today, we are losing species at a rate unknown since the dinosaurs, along with half of life on earth, went extinct 65 million years ago. This rapid dismantling of life on earth owes primarily to habitat loss, which occurs mostly from growing crops and raising livestock for people. With fewer places to live and fewer food sources to feed on, animals find food and shelter where people are, and that can lead to disease spread.

Another major cause of species loss is climate change, which can also change where animals and plants live and affect where diseases may occur. Historically, we have grown as a species in partnership with the plants and animals we live with. So, when we change the rules of the game by drastically changing the climate and life on earth, we have to expect that it will affect our health.

What actions can we take to prevent future outbreaks?

We can make many smart investments to avert another outbreak. Federal, state, and local agencies can support public health leadership and science, we can provide more funding for needed research, early response to outbreaks, and supplies for testing. And we can do much more to control the illegal wildlife trade.

We also need to take climate action to prevent the next pandemic. For example, preventing deforestation—a root cause of climate change—can help stem biodiversity loss as well as slow animal migrations that can increase risk of infectious disease spread. The recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa probably occurred in part because bats, which carried the disease, had been forced to move into new habitats because the forests they used to live in had been cut down to grow palm oil trees.

Rethinking our agricultural practices, including those that rely on raising tens of millions of animals in close quarters, can prevent transmissions between animals and spillover into human populations.

Reducing air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas also helps keep our lungs healthy, which can protect us from respiratory infections like coronavirus.

To combat climate change, we need to drastically decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Generating electricity from low-carbon energy sources like wind and solar decreases harmful air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide that lead to more heart attacks and stroke as well as obesity, diabetes, and premature deaths that put further strains on our health care systems.

Preparation for pandemics is also about keeping people healthy at baseline. If we have a population in the U.S. where a third of our population are obese, and 5-10% of people have diabetes, we’re going to be immensely more vulnerable. And if you look at why people in the U.S. are not healthy at baseline, it has to do with our diets, pollution, and climate change. We have an opportunity here to recognize that prevention is by far the best approach to protecting health.

When COVID-19 eases, and we are ready to restart our economy, we can make our workforce healthier and more climate-resilient through scaling-up our investments in low-carbon technologies.

Can you identify the communities most at-risk, and how and why both COVID-19 and climate change harms them?

People with chronic health conditions, lower-income, and communities of color are disproportionately impacted by both COVID-19 and climate change, and pollution is at the heart of both problems as a new Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public health study confirms. We know that African American communities are disproportionately exposed to air pollution and we’re now seeing this pollution driving higher mortality rates from COVID-19. We owe it to everyone to improve health, and we do that by reducing the sources of pollution that drive a large burden of disease both in the United States and around the world.

Why is it so important for health officials to talk about climate change now?

Climate change and global health policy are largely treated as separate issues by the public and media. Do we need to adjust our thinking?

Yes. The separation of health and environmental policy is a ​dangerous delusion. Our health entirely depends on the climate and the other organisms we share the planet with. We need to bring these communities together. Some progress has been made in addressing the risk of pathogen spillover from animals into people. But largely we still view the environment, and life on earth, as separate. We can and must do better if we want to prevent the next infectious pandemic. That means we must combat climate change and do far more to safeguard the diversity of life on earth, which is being lost at a rate not seen since the dinosaurs—and more than half of life on earth—went extinct 65 million years ago.

COVID-19 is killing people now and climate change is killing people now. The scale of actions to combat them are starkly different. Why?

Infectious diseases are scary because they are immediate and personal. They radically and rapidly change how we lead our lives, and they are an immediate threat to our friends and families. They hit all of our “go” buttons.

Climate change seems to many an armageddon in slow motion and its dangers can feel impersonal and its causes diffuse. It’s easy to think “I didn’t cause this” or that “it doesn’t directly affect me.” But there’s another way to look at it. Like COVID-19, if you’re concerned about climate change, you can take actions right now to improve your health and the health of your friends and loved ones.

We can learn from this pandemic that people are motivated by the personal and the actionable. At Harvard C-CHANGE, our research shows that the actions we need to combat climate change are the same actions we need to make people healthier right now, especially for diseases causing huge burdens on our health like obesity, heart disease, and cancer. We need to do much more to talk about the “burden of disease” that’s preventable, and the things we can do now to prevent it.

Is climate change too expensive to fix?

We spend just over $3 trillion every year in the United States on health care. And by some estimates, more than half the deaths in the United States are preventable, largely because of pollution, diet, exercise, and lifestyle habits like smoking. So think about the money we could save simply by reducing air pollution, eating less meat, and building exercise into our day by walking or biking more often. We could use the savings to invest in preventing climate change, among other things like education, and paying fair wages.

When you look at this question purely from a financial standpoint, air pollution is a drag on economic growth and solutions to address have been enormously cost-effective in the United States. In 2011, a study by the Environmental Protection Agency that looked at the costs and benefits of the Clean Air act found that every $1 invested to reduce air pollution returns up to $30 in benefits. The only thing our health and our economy can’t afford is climate inaction.",mainstream

Flood’s defense attorney claimed she was mentally unstable and wanted to help the boys end their pain and suffering. According to prosecutors:

“She in her letter said when she took the gun out of the drawer, she said, ‘I am sorry buddy, we are not getting better. They cannot help us, so we are going to leave, the three of us.'”1

The grandmother shot Jordan once in the stomach and Jaden in the chest. She then shot them both in the head. The gun jammed when she turned it on herself, so she took some pills instead.

Flood and the boys were discovered in her home on April 4, where the boys were pronounced dead.

Initially, Flood was charged with first-degree murder but took a plea deal with prosecutors and pled guilty to manslaughter.

During her sentencing hearing, Flood told the Pima County judge:

613,"Planet is 'way off track' in dealing with climate change, UN report says

The planet is ""way off track"" in dealing with climate change, a new United Nations report says, and experts declared that climate change is a far greater threat than the coronavirus.

""It is important that all the attention that needs to be given to fight this disease does not distract us from the need to defeat climate change,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday, according to Agence France Presse.

Although emissions have been reduced with travel curtailed because of the virus, Guterres noted that ""we will not fight climate change with a virus. Whilst the disease is expected to be temporary, climate change has been a phenomenon for many years, and and will remain with us for decades and require constant action.

""We count the cost in human lives and livelihoods as droughts, wildfires, floods and extreme storms take their deadly toll,” Guterres said.

The report confirmed that 2019 was the second-warmest year on record and the past decade the hottest in human history.

Last year ended with a global average temperature that was 1.1 degree Celsius above estimated preindustrial levels, second only to the record set in 2016, when a very strong El Niño event contributed to an increased global temperature atop the overall warming trend.

“We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5°C or 2°C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for,” Guterres wrote in the report.

""Greenhouse gas concentrations are at the highest levels in 3 million years – when the Earth’s temperature was as much as 3 degrees hotter and sea levels some 15 meters higher,” said Guterres at a joint news conference with World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas at U.N. headquarters in New York.

The main greenhouse gases that cause global warming are carbon dioxide and methane, which are emitted from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas.

“Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue. A recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. It is a matter of time,” Taalas said.

“We just had the warmest January on record. Winter was unseasonably mild in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in Australia circumnavigated the globe, causing a spike in carbon dioxide emissions.

""Record temperatures in Antarctica were accompanied by large-scale ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier which will have repercussions for sea-level rise,"" Taalas added.

Professor Brian Hoskins of Imperial College London told the Guardian that ""the report is a catalogue of weather in 2019 made more extreme by climate change, and the human misery that went with it.""

""It points to a threat that is greater to our species than any known virus – we must not be diverted from the urgency of tackling it by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to zero as soon as possible.""",mainstream
1180,"Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting down rainforests and farming livestock. This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming.

Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping the sun's heat and stopping it from leaking back into space.

Many of these gases occur naturally, but human activity is increasing the concentrations of some of them in the atmosphere, in particular:

CO is the greenhouse gas most commonly produced by human activities and it is responsible for 64% of man-made global warming. Its concentration in the atmosphere is currently 40% higher than it was when industrialisation began.

Other greenhouse gases are emitted in smaller quantities, but they trap heat far more effectively than CO , and in some cases are thousands of times stronger. Methane is responsible for 17% of man-made global warming, nitrous oxide for 6%.
• Cutting down forests (deforestation). Trees help to regulate the climate by absorbing CO from the atmosphere. So when they are cut down, that beneficial effect is lost and the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere adding to the greenhouse effect.
• Increasing livestock farming. Cows and sheep produce large amounts of methane when they digest their food.
• Fluorinated gases produce a very strong warming effect, up to 23 000 times greater than CO . Thankfully these are released in smaller quantities and are being phased down by EU regulation.

TThe current global average temperature is 0.85ºC higher than it was in the late 19th century. Each of the past three decades has been warmer than any preceding decade since records began in 1850.

The world's leading climate scientists think human activities are almost certainly the main cause of the warming observed since the middle of the 20th century.

An increase of 2°C compared to the temperature in pre-industrial times is seen by scientists as the threshold beyond which there is a much higher risk that dangerous and possibly catastrophic changes in the global environment will occur. For this reason, the international community has recognised the need to keep warming below 2°C.",mainstream
344,"What Major Factor Causing “Climate Change” Are They Not Telling Us About?

More alarming articles and studies are surfacing each day which confirm the rapidly changing state of Earth’s life support systems and climate. Humanity has decimated the planet and the chickens are coming home to roost. Though there are certainly many parts to this unfolding story, the largest piece of the puzzle by far still goes completely unacknowledged by most of the scientific community and all of the mainstream media/corporate/military/industrial complex. The massive elephant in the room has been, and still is, “stratospheric aerosol geoengineering” or “SAG”, AKA “chemtrails”.

What Is Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering And Why Is It So Dangerous?

Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering is a primary term for the ongoing global climate modification programs being conducted by major powers around the world. “Aerosols” is simply a term for microscopic particles suspended in the air. The major component of the geoengineering programs is to saturate the atmosphere by spraying millions of tons of 10 nanometer (a nanometer is 1/1,000,000,000 of a meter) toxic metal particles (aerosols) from jet aircraft. Why? Based on available data, there are a number of known objectives, though it is very likely much of the agenda associated with these programs can only be speculated on.

Many geoengineering patents have a stated goal of slowing global warming.

Aluminum/alumina, among other toxic metals, is showing up in countless rain tests around the world. The amount of aluminum, barium, and other metals in these rain/snow tests is always high and often completely off the charts. Snow tests from Mt. Shasta in Northern California were toxic beyond belief. This area of the Pacific Northwest was thought to be a pristine water source. Dozens of rain samples taken in this region from numerous individuals were tested at the State certified lab in Northern California and showed shocking results without exception. Former US Forest Service Biologist Francis Mangles has confirmed the alarming heavy metal contamination with his own testing. Snow tests taken from the side of Mt. Shasta showed aluminum content as high as 61,000 PPB. (parts per billion). This level of aluminum in the snow is tens of thousands of times anything that might be considered “normal background” contamination.

Levels this high can only be considered highly toxic. Since these toxic metals are in the snow, they can only come from the air. Aluminum/alumina in “free form” does not naturally exist in the environment but is always bonded to other elements. So where is it coming from? Aluminum is the primary element named in numerous geoengineering patents. The same patents that describe dispersing this aluminum from jets for the expressed purpose of blocking the sun which is exactly what we see aircraft “trails” doing in our skies day in and day out.

It is important to remember this contamination is not local, but global in scope. Movements have formed in countries all over the world which are desperately trying to address this dire issue.

Ozone layer damage is yet another known consequence of geoengineering the atmosphere. Other recent studies now note a “shrinking atmosphere” which is very possibly also linked to the ongoing geoengineering programs.

The “hydrological cycle” of the planet is being completely disrupted by the geoengineering aerosol saturation of the atmosphere. Fungal proliferation is yet another inevitable crisis when the atmosphere is filled with particulates, soils are contaminated with the geoengineering fallout, and waters are polluted with the same. Already, countless species are feeling the effects. The current “species extinction rate” should be absolutely shocking to all. At the present time the “extinction rate” is from 1000 to 10,000 times “natural variability”. This is from 100,000% to 1,000,000% of “normal background rates”. Though mainstream media would never discuss this, we are currently in the sixth mass extinction on planet Earth. Is geoengineering responsible for all of this? Of course not all, but if the available science and data is considered, geoengineering is likely by far the single most significant cause of environmental and climate devastation.

If all available information is considered, geoengineering appears to be the greatest and most immediate threat to all life on Earth short of nuclear catastrophe.

Less Rain, Less Wind, Less Sun, Welcome To Geoengineering

Though rain and snow is falling in areas of North America, at times in a deluge or “blizzard”, the droughts in the continental US ( and many other regions around the globe), are getting worse. There are now often massive areas of drifting cloud cover spanning thousands of miles over land masses and oceans with very little precipitation. Why is this? Why are the skies so often completely featureless as these expansive cloud banks and upper level “haze” drift across the globe? If individual clouds can be recognized in these “drifting masses”, they often appear “melted into” the upper story of geoengineering “haze”.

Why is the wind often diminished under these featureless canopies? Horizon-to-horizon geoengineering trails are not the only sign of spraying. Clouds should be “white” and the sky “blue”. Wispy, dingy, cobweb like upper level “clouds” are are not natural and another hallmark of spraying, as are “silvery white” skies.

Atmospheric aerosol saturation diminishes wind and precipitation. The conditions described above are known consequences of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (SAG) and solar radiation management (SRM) . All available scientific data confirms the effect of geoengineering particulates on rainfall. Though mainstream science sources are still not willing to openly admit to the fact that geoengineering programs have been fully deployed for decades, a growing mountain of evidence makes this fact all too clear. The ongoing stratospheric geoengineering programs are greatly reducing overall rainfall and all but eliminating deep blue skies. Blocking the sun with reflective geoengineering aerosols reduces evaporation. Wind is reduced significantly from atmospheric aerosol saturation as the particles scatter solar energy and thus reduce convection from the ground that would otherwise occur from daytime heating. The slowing of the wind reduces evaporation even more. Further, precipitation cells that do form are often dispersed and diminished from the excessive amount of geoengineering particulates. This causes to many “condensation nuclei” and the droplets do not combine and fall as rain but migrate on.

It is important to remember that there are ALWAYS exceptions to the geoengineering consequences outlined in scientific study. There are simply far too many variables in the extremely complex climate system. Colliding air masses, strong weather fronts, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc., are all among such variables that can still produce devastating and destructive winds and rains even with extensive geoengineering.

There is a mountain of scientific data to confirm the reality of “global dimming”. Most have never even heard the term much less noticed the effect over recent decades. Though articles from mainstream publications admit to the “global dimming” issue, most understate the percentage of dimming, and all point the finger at “pollution particulates” as the sole cause. Countless jet aircraft which criss-cross our skies daily, dispersing millions of tons of toxic metal and chemical particulates, are completely ignored by all mainstream media journalists and sources.

To date, mainstream media has done its best to avoid even mentioning the subject of geoengineering much less admitting to these ongoing programs of total planetary devastation. The overall ramifications from global dimming and geoengineering cannot be accurately quantified. Loss of photosynthesis, destruction of the ozone layer, reduction in global rainfall, loss of blue sky, toxification of soils and waters, these are only a few of the known consequences of the global atmospheric spraying

What does this imply? As already documented above, saturating the atmosphere with particulates shreds the protective layers of the atmosphere, namely the ozone layer. Particulate saturation in the upper atmosphere causes a chemical reaction which does the damage. There is now a massive Northern hemisphere ozone hole in addition to the Southern Hemisphere hole we have all heard about for decades. Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering is in all likelihood the primary cause of the global ozone depletion, not just “CFC’s” as we have been told. Again, this has already been cited above and can be easily researched. Search “geoengineering damages ozone layer”. All available science makes this point clear. Without the ozone layer, life in any form would likely not exist on our planet.

There is yet one more issue related to the destruction of our natural protection from the sun’s usual radiation output: protection from solar flares. Coronal mass ejections or “CME’s” can and will do horrific damage to our planet and most especially human infrastructure. If electricity grids are shut down due to a strong CME, the potential dangers are sobering indeed. With no grid power to cool nuclear power facilities for an extended time, we could face Fukushima x 100, or 200, or more. Without cooling, meltdowns would eventually occur. Just one major nuclear catastrophe could exterminate life on the planet, let alone dozens or hundreds of them. Geoengineering is destroying our natural protection from such an event caused by a strong coronal mass ejection.

Wind current pattern changes in turn trigger ocean current changes. Most are completely unaware of the wind and ocean current changes occurring around the globe. Even fewer are aware of the ramifications which are already unfolding from these changes.

 

 Ocean current changes are already delivering warmer waters to regions with vast undersea methane deposits. These deposits are known as “methane hydrate” deposits and literally hold life on earth in the balance. Many regions around the globe are beginning to expel methane from hydrate and clathrate deposits. The East Siberian Shelf of the Arctic is already releasing en masse. All available data indicates that this event alone is changing our biosphere by the day. Though groups of scientists like the “Arctic Methane Emergency Group” (AMEG) are calling for “emergency wartime scale geoengineering to avert planetary catastrophe”, available data indicates that the very geoengineering programs they are selling as a cure, are more likely a major causal factor in triggering the methane catastrophe in the first place. The fully deployed planetary geoengineering programs have been altering wind and rain patterns at an ever increasing level for decades. Again, it is these alterations that have likely been a major factor in the triggering of mass methane release due to the altered ocean currents and altered hydrological cycles from the ongoing geoengineering programs.

Saturation of the atmosphere with methane is equivalent to covering the planet with a sheet of glass. The sun’s thermal energy gets in, but does not get out. Though most articles on methane release state methane to be 20 times more potent a greenhouse gas than Co2, this is over a 100-year time horizon. Over a ten-year time horizon, methane is at least 100 times more potent. Again, the implications from this event alone threaten all life on Earth.

The global geoengineering/weather modification/chemtrail programs have likely been going on for over six decades. Recently found documents from the NASA archives indicate the these programs already had budgets into the hundreds of millions of dollars even by the mid 1960s. These already massive climate altering programs were radically ramped up in the last 15 years. Though most of us alive today have perhaps known little truly “natural” weather, what we are experiencing today is anything but natural. The climate now “swings” radically from one extreme to another. It is now common to have spring-like temperatures one day and snow (likely artificially nucleated) the next. These “swings”or “fluctuations” are getting ever more severe.

Manipulation Of The Jet Stream And The Shredding Of The Atmosphere

Is this really possible? Available science as well as observed weather events and jet stream “anomalies” say absolutely yes.

HAARP is the acronym for a massively powerful “ionosphere heater” facility located in Alaska. This is a huge and extremely powerful antenna array which is capable of transmitting as much as a billion watts of power into the ionosphere. The effect of this is to create a ‘bulge” in the atmosphere which in turn can alter the course of the jet stream. Such alterations can in turn “steer” weather systems. By such manipulation, storm fronts can be combined and worsened into “frankenstorms”, or broken apart and dispersed.

There are thought to be at least 18 of these “ionosphere heaters” around the globe, some held by China and Russia. It has also become evident in recent years that “weather warfare” is already a lethal global reality. The potential of these frequency transmitter facilities is enhanced by the spraying of our skies. The saturation of the atmosphere with metal particulates makes the atmosphere more “conductive”. This in turn increases the capabilities of the ionosphere heaters.

Dry Lightning And Out Of Control Forest Fires

An atmosphere that is more conductive from metal particulate saturation can produce more frequent lightning. These same particulates also have the net effect of “diminishing and dispersing” rain. Forests around the globe are now filled with dead and dying trees. (referenced later in this article). In addition, the foliage of trees are now covered with what amounts to an “incendiary” dust from the geoengineering particulates. Add the shredded ozone layer which creates more heat, and the “weather modified” conditions are even worse. The obvious result is more frequent and catastrophic forest fires. This phenomenon is being played out around the globe. Summer of 2012 saw the Northern Hemisphere burning down and now it is Australia and Tasmania in meltdown.

Yet another seemingly impossible aspect of global weather modification is geoengineered snow storms.

Many will write this one off as impossible without any investigation. That is a mistake as the science of chemical ice nucleation is very established and commonly practiced in many arenas though it is hard to comprehend this process being done on such a massive scale.

There are several patents on “artificial ice nucleation for weather modification”, including one from NASA.

Artificially nucleated storms appear to be carried out under a myriad of conditions. In many cases, storms that should have yielded only rain, can be artificially nucleated to “change over” to snow. The term “change over” has recently been coined by The Weather Channel and other corporate/military/industrial complex weather agencies. A geoengineered snow event is generally called “heavy wet snow” (another recent term). This “snow” can begin to fall at temperatures far above freezing, though the ongoing chemical process eventually cools the surrounding air mass. The resulting “snow” and “ice” can sometimes remain a surprisingly long time in spite of warmer temperatures, a result of artificial chemical nucleation. This aspect of weather modification is covered in the following article, “Geoengineered Snow Storms Wreaking Havoc Around the Globe”

Temporary Cooling At The Cost Of A Worsened Overall Warming

This is the net result of geoengineering. Nature does not give something for nothing. This should seem all too obvious, but unfortunately the “scientists” in so many cases seem to be completely blind to the facts. In the case of cloud seeding to produce rain, if they succeed, then that moisture will not end up where it would have otherwise gone. In the case of saturation spraying that is known to diminish rain by scattering it into massive artificial cloud cover, where will all that moisture end up? Coming down somewhere else in a deluge? Is this perhaps why the US is locked in record drought and England is having record rains?

The cooling effects of geoenigneering come at the cost of a much worsened overall warming of the planet. Even NASA admits the “condensation trails” (geoengineering particulate trails) are warming the planet.

The Systemic Poisoning Of All Life On Earth

Sound like an “alarmist” statement or conspiracy theory? All available data points to this conclusion as a hard and undeniable fact for any that do objective research.

Countless lab tests of precipitation from around the globe (cited above) have been done by concerned individuals and groups in recent years, and the results are shocking to say the least. Our rain and snow is quite literally packed with the very same highly toxic heavy metals named in numerous geoengineering patents as primary elements. The air we breathe is also laden with the same toxins aluminum/alumina, barium, strontium, manganese, thorium, and now even fluoride is being reported in recent tests from Norway. So much metal has fallen on the boreal forests of the Pacific Northwest that soil PH changes of up to 15 times more alkaline have been noted. A recent documentary film by filmmaker Michael Murphy, “Why In The World Are They Spraying” covers some of these changes and the forest die off that is occurring in boreal forests. Though there are countless articles documenting the die-off of forests around the globe, putting the blame only on increasing temperatures, drought, and beetles, none mention geoengineering. To omit geoengineering in this equation is to omit what appears to be the greatest factor of all. The lethal effects of “bioavailable” aluminum/alumina in rainwater and thus in the soils is well documented. Its effect on trees is also noted in science studies.

Off course there are corporations who exist to profit from calamity. Monsanto always seems to be at the top of this list. As geoengineered drought and aluminum sterilized soils force independent farmers to sell, international ag corporations are there to buy up the land and put to use there “aluminum resistant seeds.”

What Is Geoengineering Doing To Us?

Inhalation of microscopic particulates is highly damaging no matter what the particulate material. Respiratory ailments and mortalities are now literally epidemic. Degenerative human diseases that are linked to heavy metal exposure are even more lethal and are now going virtually off the charts. ADD, Alzheimer’s, Autism, immune dysfunction, and many other diseases associated with heavy metals, have all skyrocketed in recent years. According to scientists like internationally know neuroscientist Russell Blalock, the heavy metal nano particles are so small that they pass right through the lung lining into the bloodstream. There they can adhere to cell receptors like a plaque, slowly but surely shutting down bodily functions and the immune system. These metals are all but impossible to remove once they have become lodged in the body. In addition, virtually every bite we eat is now contaminated with these toxic nano particles as they are absorbed by plant life, which is highly damaging to crops.

Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (AKA chemtrails) has now tainted all. Every breath we take, every bite we eat, all is contaminated. A mountain of data, studies, and testing confirms this conclusion beyond reasonable doubt.

We are all quite literally under assault. The threat to all life on earth from the global weather modification programs cannot be overstated. It is up to all of us to help in the task of bringing these programs to light, and to a halt so the planet can begin to recover. Arm yourself with copies or credible articles, data, and DVD copies. Why In The World Are They Spraying? by Michael Murphy is an excellent tool for spreading the word on this most dire issue.

It is likely the vast majority of military and private sector people involved with geoengineering do not understand the consequences.

Time is not on our side. Every day global geoengineering continues, our odds are diminished. We must all pull together in the effort to shine the light on this greatest of all human crimes. Once the geoengineering issue is truly out in the open, and those who physically carry out the spraying realize what they are a part of, we have a chance to stop these lethal programs.

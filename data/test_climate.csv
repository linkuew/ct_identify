1067,"Broadcast regulator Ofcom has thrown out a Tory complaint over Channel 4 News' climate change debate after Boris Johnson refused to take part.

The broadcaster 'empty chaired' the Tory leader in the debate - and replaced him on screen with an ice sculpture, slowly melting under the studio lights.

Ofcom said the sculpture was not supposed to ""personally"" represent Mr Johnson and that little editorial focus was given to the object throughout the debate.

The party sent Michael Gove to the studio to offer to stand in for the leader's debate, but the other leaders taking part in the debate turned him down.

He arrived at the studio along with a camera, capturing the stunt for the Tories' social media outlets.

This morning the regulator said they had rejected the complaint.

A spokesman said: ""In this case, the Election Committee concluded that, across the one-hour debate and a subsequent news programme, Channel 4’s use of editorial techniques ensured that the Conservative’s viewpoint on climate and environmental issues was adequately reflected and given due weight.

They added: ""The Committee also took into account that the globe ice sculpture was not a representation of the Prime Minister personally, and little editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants""

The party made a formal complaint to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom's election committee over what it said was ""a provocative partisan stunt, which would itself constitute making a political opinion in its own right"".

And a Tory source threatened to ""reconsider"" the broadcaster's licence over the row.

Mr Johnson told LBC the following day: ""I didn't see the debate but it is noticeable that people have talked more about that than the substance that came out of the debate and I think that is a shame.""

Answering a question about the Tory threat to review the publicly-owned broadcaster's licence, he responded: ""What we want is a free, fair and exuberant, unbridled media. That's what I want.

""I think a free press is one of the glories of our country and I want to protect it and enshrine it.""

Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson wrote to Ofcom about the matter and said it was ""deeply concerning that a governing party would wish to restrict the free press"".

In his letter, he said: ""I'm urging you to call out this meddling and demand that whichever political party wins the next General Election allows Ofcom to operate freely from political interference.

""We need a strong free press, but the Tories are restricting journalists. This campaign, Boris Johnson has banned the Daily Mirror from its battle bus, ducked the Andrew Neil interview and now attempted to bully Channel 4.""

On the day of the debate, presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy, tweeted: ""It was kind of Michael Gove to turn up at Channel 4 News tonight offering to come on the Climate Debate but the other party leaders will only debate other party leaders.

""We look forward to welcoming Mr Gove another time.""",mainstream,M09fec,climate.change
560,"1. Over the past three years, climate change has become a pillar of the U.S.-China bilateral relationship. Both countries have taken strong measures at home to build green, low-carbon and climate-resilient economies, helping galvanize global action to combat climate change and culminating in the Paris Agreement reached last December. With their joint announcement of ambitious climate actions in November 2014, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping sought to lead by example, and by the time the Paris conference opened a year later, some 186 countries had put forward their own climate actions. In September 2015, the two leaders laid out a common vision for the Paris outcome during President Xi’s State Visit to Washington and also announced major domestic policy measures and cooperative initiatives to combat climate change, as well as significant progress on climate finance. In Paris, the United States and China, working together and with others, played a critical role in crafting a historic, ambitious global climate change agreement.

2. Today, the two Presidents announce another significant step in their joint climate efforts. The United States and China will sign the Paris Agreement on April 22nd and take their respective domestic steps in order to join the Agreement as early as possible this year. They encourage other Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to do the same, with a view to bringing the Paris Agreement into force as early as possible. The Presidents further express their commitment to work together and with others to promote the full implementation of the Paris Agreement to win the fight against the climate threat.

3. The Presidents recognize that the Paris Agreement marks a global commitment to tackling climate change and a strong signal of the need for a swift transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies. In this regard, the Presidents are also committed to working bilaterally and with other countries to achieve successful outcomes this year in related multilateral fora, including on an HFC amendment under the Montreal Protocol pursuant to the Dubai Pathway and on a global market-based measure for addressing greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation at the International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly. To accelerate clean energy innovation and deployment, they will work together to implement the goals of the Mission Innovation initiative announced at the Paris conference and carry forward the work of the Clean Energy Ministerial. They support a successful G-20 Summit in Hangzhou this year, including strong climate and clean energy outcomes, and call on the G-20 countries to engage constructively in international cooperation on energy and climate change. And they will continue to deepen and broaden bilateral cooperation through the U.S.-China Climate Change Working Group, the U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center, and other efforts.

4. Finally, the Presidents commit to taking concrete steps to implement the commitments they made in their September 2015 Joint Statement to use public resources to finance and encourage the transition toward low carbon technologies as a priority. Since the Joint Statement, the United States led an effort in the OECD to successfully adopt the first-ever set of multilateral standards for support of coal-fired power plants using export credit, and China has been strengthening its green and low-carbon policies and regulations with a view to strictly controlling public investment flowing into projects with high pollution and carbon emissions both domestically and internationally.

5. The joint efforts by China and the United States on climate change will serve as an enduring legacy of the partnership between our two countries.",mainstream,M07f0a,climate.change
599,"Every aspect of our lives has been affected by the coronavirus. The global economy has slowed, people have retreated to their homes and thousands have died or become seriously ill.

At this frightening stage of the crisis, it’s difficult to focus on anything else. But as the International Agency has said, the effects of coronavirus are likely to be temporary but the other global emergency – climate change – is not.

Stopping the spread of coronavirus is paramount, but climate action must also continue. And we can draw many lessons and opportunities from the current health crisis when tackling planetary warming.

S&P Global Ratings this week said measures to contain COVID-19 have pushed the global economy into recession.

Economic analyst Lauri Myllyvirta estimates the pandemic may have reduced global emissions by 200 megatonnes of carbon dioxide to date, as air travel grinds to a halt, factories close down and energy demand falls.

In the first four weeks of the pandemic, coal consumption in China alone fell by 36%, and oil refining capacity reduced by 34%.

In many ways, what we’re seeing now is a rapid and unplanned version of economic “degrowth” – the transition some academics and activists have for decades said is necessary to address climate change, and leave a habitable planet for future generations.

Read more: Life in a 'degrowth' economy, and why you might actually enjoy it

Degrowth is a proposed slowing of growth in sectors that damage the environment, such as fossil fuel industries, until the economy operates within Earth’s limits. It is a voluntary, planned and equitable transition in developed nations which necessarily involves an increased focus on the environment, human well-being, and capabilities (good health, decent work, education, and a safe and healthy environment).

Such a transformation would be profound, and so far no nation has shown the will to implement it. It would require global economies to “decouple” from carbon to prevent climate-related crises. But the current unintended economic slowdown opens the door to such a transition, which would bring myriad benefits to the climate.

The idea of sustainable degrowth is very different to a recession. It involves scaling back environmentally damaging sectors of the economy, and strengthening others.

Climate change has been declared a global emergency, yet to date the world has largely failed to address it. In contrast, the global policy response to the coronavirus emergency has been fast and furious.

There are several reasons for this dramatic difference. Climate change is a relatively slow-moving crisis, whereas coronavirus visibly escalates over days, even hours, increasing our perception of the risks involved. One thing that history teaches us about politics and the human condition in times of peril, we often take a “crisis management” approach to dealing with serious threats.

Read more: How changes brought on by coronavirus could help tackle climate change

As others have observed, the slow increase in global temperatures means humans can psychologically adjust as the situation worsens, making the problem seem less urgent and meaning people are less willing to accept drastic policy measures.

The global response to the coronavirus crisis shows that governments can take immediate, radical emergency measures, which go beyond purely economic concerns, to protect the well-being of all.

Specifically, there are practical lessons and opportunities we can take away from the coronavirus emergency as we seek to tackle climate change:

Act early: The coronavirus pandemic shows the crucial importance of early action to prevent catastrophic consequences. Governments in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore acted quickly to implement quarantine and screening measures, and have seen relatively small numbers of infections. Italy, on the other hand, whose government waited too long to act, is now the epicentre of the virus.

Read more: Running out of things to do in isolation? Get back in the garden with these ideas from 4 experts

Go slow, go local: Coronavirus has forced an immediate scale-down of how we travel and live. People are forging local connections, shopping locally, working from home and limiting consumption to what they need.

Researchers have identified that fears about personal well-being represent a major barrier to political support for the degrowth movement to date. However with social distancing expected to be in place for months, our scaled-down lives may become the “new normal”. Many people may realise that consumption and personal well-being are not inextricably linked.

New economic thinking is needed. A transition to sustainable degrowth can help. We need to shift global attention from GDP as an indicator of well-being, towards other measures that put people and the environment first, such as New Zealand’s well-being budget, Bhutan’s gross national happiness index, or Ecuador’s social philosophy of buen vivir (good living).

Spend on clean energy: The International Energy Agency (IEA) says clean energy should be “at the heart of stimulus plans to counter the coronavirus crisis”.

The IEA has called on governments to launch sustainable stimulus packages focused on clean energy technologies. It says hydrogen and carbon-capture also need major investment to bring them to scale, which could be helped by the current low interest rates.

Governments could also use coronavirus stimulus packages to reskill workers to service the new “green” economy, and address challenges in healthcare, sanitation, aged care, food security and education.

The coronavirus crisis is devastating, but failing to tackle climate change because of the pandemic only compounds the tragedy. Instead, we must draw on the lessons of coronavirus to address the climate challenge.",mainstream,M0850a,climate.change
1141,"Australia’s Iconic Platypus Has Been Pushed to the Brink of Extinction, Scientists Warn

With Australia’s spiraling environmental catastrophe receiving world attention in recent weeks, ecologists have sounded the alarm on the dire threat faced by the country’s endemic wildlife populations.

Researchers are now warning that the platypus—the unusual duck-billed, egg-laying mammal native to eastern Australia whose existence was believed to be a hoax in the late 18th century—is one of the iconic species teetering on the brink of extinction.

According to a new study by the University of New South Wales (UNSW) that was published in the scientific journal Biological Conservation, platypus numbers have declined by half or more since the European colonization of the island continent with local extinctions occurring across 40 percent of the species natural habitat thanks to drought and human activity such as dam building, water harvesting, land clearances, the impacts of livestock and threats from feral species.

Along with other contemporary threats including the changing climate, scientists fear that platypus numbers will continue to decline between 47 percent and 66 percent by 2070.

However, when taking fast-heating climate projections into account the animal’s decline could rapidly fall by 51 percent to 73 over the next five decades—pushing the species once common in the country’s waterways toward all-out extinction.

The danger to platypuses has become alarming in recent consecutive years as brutal heatwaves and arid conditions made worse by the dearth of rainfall have had a devastating effect on local populations.

Platypus populations, like other aquatic species, are believed to have taken major damage from an intensifying drought and record heat, even prior to the bushfire crisis.

AFP reports that study co-author Gilad Bino, a researcher at the University of NSW’s Centre for Ecosystem Science, said:

The study recommended that national authorities give attention to the “urgent need” for a risk assessment that could downgrade the animal to “vulnerable” status and look at the steps necessary to conserve the species and “minimize any risk of extinction.”

The government has taken few if any measures to protect the species despite the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recently downgrading the nocturnal creature’s status to “near threatened.”

The study notes that such conservationist measures would include “increasing surveys, tracking trends, mitigating threats and improving management of platypus habitat in rivers.”

The platypus, along with four species of echidnas, are the world’s only monotremes or egg-laying mammals that secrete milk from the female bellies.

Australia’s ABC reports that conservationists have seen a precipitous drop in platypus numbers in traditional habitats such as NSW’s Great Barrington region. Tim Faulkner, the president of conservationist group Aussie Ark, said:

“In our region, they’re all dead, they’re gone—I can’t find them … They don’t go into hibernation … They must have water to feed in. Private landholder management, the management of riparian zones along creeks, water harvest as well as control on stock trampling [are all required]. And going to the toilet in the last fragments of water [must also be controlled]. Our own parks are full of pests like the feral fox and cats responsible for over 90 per cent of all mainland mammal extinction.”

“The platypus that we did rescue, we had two die the next day … Their bellies are empty and they’re all riddled with E. coli and a greater diversity of bacteria than that. Platypus are a Gondwanan dinosaur species—they are monotremes, egg-laying mammals, some of the oldest lineages of mammals on earth. They’ve been in this constant east coast temperate environment, largely unchanged, for millions of years. To see it now … a cesspit that’s bacteria ridden and lifeless … certainly in our area—and this must be so wide spread—they’re gone.”

With its unique set of physical features, early sketches of the duck-billed mammal shocked western scientists who stumbled on the existence of the platypus during the colonization of Australia. Even after the creature’s pelt was delivered to researchers in the U.K., the existence of the platypus was believed to be a hoax comprised of a duck’s bill sewn onto a beaver’s body. The species was then hunted for its fur until the last century.

1204,"Greenpeace Founder: AOC's Green New Deal Would Lead To 'End of Civilization'

Patrick Moore explained precisely how the 'Green New Deal' would end in catastrophe

Founder of environmental group Greenpeace Patrick Moore told Fox News's Tucker Carlson that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's “Green New Deal” would trigger the end of civilization.

Moore explained precisely how the “Green New Deal” would end in catastrophe as half the population starved and every tree on the planet was eliminated.

The environmentalist took aim at the progressive congresswoman arguing that without fossil fuels, “How do you get the food to the center of New York, to Manhattan, where AOC is from? You don’t.”

Moore already denounced the scientific community that supports Global Warming and Climate Change, painting it as a ""catastrophic theory"" that's being pushed by ""corrupt scientists"" who are ""hooked on government grants.""

The former president of Greenpeace Canada said so-called ""green"" companies seize the narrative to win grants and tax cuts along with favorable reporting across the media.

Mr. Moore co-founded Greenpeace in the early 1970s and campaigned for environmental issues for 50 years.

In 2006, he wrote to the Royal Society challenging them that there was ""no scientific proof"" humans were causing global climate change and it ""has a much better correlation with changes in solar activity than CO2 levels.""

Tucker Carson asked Moore, “So, you’re one of the founders of the most famous environmental organizations in the world, and you think the ‘Green New Deal’ sounds terrifying. Tell us why.”

Well, because it would be basically the end of civilization if 85% of the world’s and also 85% of the U.S.'s energy in the form of coal, oil, natural gas were phased out over the next few years, like ten years.

We do not have anything to replace them with.

Yes, if we went into a crash course of building nuclear reactors, we could replace them for producing electricity.

But that isn't going to happen because the Greens are against nuclear and they are even against hydroelectric dams which at least is renewable.

But they don't support that either. So basically they are opposed to approximately 98.5% of all the electricity that we are using and nearly 100% of all of the vehicle and transportation and ships and planes energy that we are using.

So when I tweeted the other day, and it had a huge response, over three million impressions on Twitter, I said, you don’t have a plan to feed eight billion people without fossil fuels or get the food into the cities, where it’s needed.

That requires large trucks, and there’s not going to be any electric trucks any time soon hauling forty tons of food into the supermarkets where the people in the cities probably think it originates, in the supermarket.

But it does not.

It’s coming from farms out in the country, where a few million people are growing the food for all the rest of the population. And if we ban fossil fuels, first, agricultural production would collapse in a very short period of time.

There are these things called tractors, and they use fuel, and all the other implements on the farm, and then there’s the transportation.

So when you have no fuel, how do you get the food to the center of New York, to Manhattan, where AOC is from?

You don’t. Then the people there will begin to starve, and that will spread out as a rot from the center of the metropolises all across the country, and half the population will die in a very short period.

And as I also pointed out, there wouldn’t be a tree left on this planet.

Say this was a worldwide thing, because the United States is not going to ban fossil fuels if no one else does; but say the Paris Agreement came into effect, fully all around the world and everybody banned fossil fuels, there wouldn’t be a tree left on this planet because that would be all there was for fuel, for heating and cooking, as they did in the old days, when there was hardly anybody on the planet compared to what there is today.

So just that one point, never mind the insanity of banning aircraft and fossil fuel-using vehicles.

“Well, you’ve just completely blown my mind. And I knew some of that, but the way you put it was really stirring.”

1232,"In 1916, Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton was forced to make a treacherous voyage across the open waters of the Southern Ocean after his ship Endurance was crushed by pack ice and sank in the Weddell Sea. Along with five members of his party, Shackleton set out for the island of South Georgia in a 23-foot-long wooden lifeboat named the James Caird. Eleven days into the trip, on May 5, Shackleton thought he spied a clearing in the murky sky above. What he was actually seeing wasn’t a break in the clouds, but the white crest of a monstrous wave bearing down on them.

“During twenty-six years’ experience of the ocean in all its moods I had not encountered a wave so gigantic,” Shackleton would later write in his book South: The Story of Shackleton’s Last Expedition 1914-1917. “It was a mighty upheaval of the ocean, a thing quite apart from the big white-capped seas that had been our tireless enemies for many days.”

Shackleton’s account remains one of the most evocative descriptions of the westerly winds that circle the globe between 30 and 60 degrees latitude in both hemispheres and the colossal waves they whip up in the Southern Ocean. Today, the southern westerlies are back in focus for entirely different reasons: their potential impact on climate change.

The world’s oceans take up more than a quarter of the carbon humans are emitting into the atmosphere, partially mitigating the greenhouse effect of that carbon. And the Southern Ocean accounts for nearly 40 percent of this marine carbon absorption, even though it makes up only one-fifth of Earth’s ocean surface area. There could be enormous consequences for our already warming planet from even a small reduction in the Southern Ocean’s ability to suck up carbon from the atmosphere.

Scientists say this reduction may already be happening, and they suspect that the westerlies in the Southern Hemisphere, which are stronger than their northern counterparts because they blow mostly over open water, are to blame. Records of actual wind speeds, as well as estimates of wind speeds from measurements of atmospheric pressure, provide clear signs that the westerlies in both hemispheres are shifting toward the poles and intensifying. Climate models show that these changes are partly due to global warming, and research is afoot to determine if they are hindering the Southern Ocean’s capacity to pull carbon out of the atmosphere.

“There are questions about what’s going to happen if the winds continue to get stronger,” says paleoclimate scientist Krystyna Saunders of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation in Sydney. “How much can the oceans actually absorb?”

Saunders and her colleagues are finding clues that over the past 12,000 years of Earth’s history, higher wind speeds and greater concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have gone together. If this link between wind and CO₂ holds true today, it will lead to higher levels of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, which will speed up climate change, which could further intensify the westerlies.

There’s growing evidence that, at least in the winter months when the westerlies are at their most violent, some parts of the Southern Ocean are giving off more of the gas than was previously estimated. It has all the makings of a vicious cycle.

The westerlies are the result of a global atmospheric circulation system, starting with what is called the Hadley cell. The cell forms as warm, moist air near the equator rises into the upper atmosphere and then, as it cools and dries, much of it sinks down toward Earth at about 30 degrees latitude in each hemisphere. Lower in the atmosphere, this air moves back toward the equator, completing the cell. Some of this downward-moving mass of air escapes the Hadley cell and moves away from the equator, and is deflected by Earth’s rotation, creating the westerlies. Because the westerlies form at the edge of each hemisphere’s Hadley cell that is closest to the pole, the bigger the size of the cell, the more the winds move toward the pole.

Data collected by weather balloons, satellites and other means going back to 1960 show that Earth’s tropical belt has widened in the past few decades by a few degrees of latitude, effectively expanding the size of the Hadley cells. This is partly due to global warming, as predicted by climate models. At the same time, the westerlies have been pushed poleward. With less distance to cover as they circle a narrower part of the globe, the law of conservation of angular momentum dictates that the winds should increase in speed, much like an ice skater rotates faster when she draws in her arms. And measurements during the past three decades show that the westerlies have, indeed, intensified.

As researchers were making sense of these changes to the westerlies, other scientists began using measurements of CO₂ levels in the atmosphere to determine whether the shifting, speedier westerlies are causing a drop in the amount of CO₂ being absorbed by the Southern Ocean. They had reason to suppose that this would happen.

Like any gas, carbon dioxide exerts a pressure that depends on the amount of the gas relative to other gases in a mixture. If this so-called partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO₂) of the atmosphere is greater than the pCO₂ of the ocean, then the ocean will absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Otherwise it will release it. And as the westerlies get stronger, the pCO₂ of the Southern Ocean could change, due to shifts in the pattern of ocean currents.

The westerlies drive the Southern Ocean current that circles Antarctica. The predominantly west-to-east current is further acted upon by a force generated by Earth’s rotation, known as the Coriolis force, which deflects moving objects to their right in the Northern Hemisphere and to their left in the Southern Hemisphere. The current circling Antarctica is deflected to its left, or northward, pushing the surface waters away from the pole. This sets the stage for water from deep in the Southern Ocean to move to the surface. Up to 80 percent of all the deep water that returns to the surface around the globe makes that return in the Southern Ocean. “It’s unique,” says climate scientist Joellen Russell of the University of Arizona in Tucson. “There's nothing like it in the world.”

This massive upwelling of the deeper, carbon-rich waters of the Southern Ocean increases the pCO₂ of the ocean surface, which decreases its capacity to act as a carbon sink, the argument goes. But is this what is actually happening?

The Southern Ocean has been loath to reveal its workings. This is due to the complicating effects of local wind patterns and the fact that researchers are only just beginning to make direct measurements of the outgassing of CO₂ during peak winter months there. So far, the data paint a somewhat confusing, and concerning, picture.

Previous estimates had shown that between 1981 and 2004, the Southern Ocean absorbed about 80 million fewer metric tons of carbon per year than expected. This was a cause for concern, given that the Southern Ocean is “the most important marine carbon sink on the planet,” says ocean biogeochemist Peter Landschützer of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.

So Landschützer and his colleagues took a closer look at a global database of pCO₂ values, created from observations of surface waters by instruments deployed in the sea or carried on research and commercial ships. Known as the Surface Ocean CO₂ Atlas (SOCAT) and established in 2007, it contains almost 26 million observations of global oceans and coastal seas from 1957 to 2019. Since data are sparser for the earlier decades than for recent years, Landschützer’s team filled in the gaps using other, less direct but more frequently measured parameters such as sea surface temperature and salinity and their well-understood relationship to pCO₂ of surface waters.

They estimated that the Southern Ocean had indeed taken in less CO₂ than expected from 1982 to 2001. The trend reversed in 2002, with the ocean acting as a more vigorous carbon sink all the way up to 2011. From 2011 to 2016, however, the Southern Ocean went back to being less effective in its carbon absorption. The team tried to find a link between the changes in the Southern Ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂ and the poleward-shifted westerlies. “We were quite surprised that we did not,” Landschützer says.

This called for an explanation, and the answer turned out to be complicated. Further analysis showed that the changing westerlies are, indeed, increasing the upwelling of carbon-rich deep waters near Antarctica. This effect, though, is being offset further north in the Southern Ocean by an increased carbon uptake in regions where the westerlies are blowing less vigorously than in the past. This would imply that there should be no overall change in the absorption of carbon. But Landschützer’s team found that the Southern Ocean’s ability to absorb carbon is increasing or decreasing over timescales of roughly a decade. The researchers put these flips down to the local wind patterns in different parts of the Southern Ocean known as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian sectors. Winds there seem to change every decade, as evidenced by about 35 years of data, and those local alterations line up well with carbon absorption trends, Landschützer says.

All of the above analysis was based on data collected by ships plying the Southern Ocean mainly during summer. The data for the winter season was spotty; it is hard for ships to venture close to Antarctica at that time. So Landschützer’s team used the richer summer data and the sparse winter data to extrapolate and account for the winter months as best they could.

But in recent years, researchers have started using floats that are offering a new, broader glimpse of winter goings-on in the Southern Ocean. And the data are disconcerting. Oceanographer Alison Gray of the University of Washington and her colleagues used data collected by 35 of these autonomous floats, deployed by the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project. The floats, which had continuously monitored the top 2,000 meters of the Southern Ocean waters from May 1, 2014, to May 1, 2017, have sensors for a range of ocean surface parameters, and these can be used to calculate the pCO₂ of the surface waters. The analysis by Gray’s team showed that the Southern Ocean around Antarctica is outgassing significantly more CO₂ in the winter than Lanschützer’s methodology estimated.

To see if they could resolve the discrepancy, Landschützer and colleagues combined the data sets and found that “the truth lies somewhere in the middle,” he says: The carbon uptake is not as low as the direct float measurements suggest, but neither is it as high as estimated by the ship-only data.

While more work will help climate scientists understand exactly what’s happening in the Southern Ocean, for the University of Arizona’s Russell, the direct winter data from the SOCCOM floats is already raising alarms. “In the deep winter, when the winds are howling the strongest and the deepest layers are being stirred to the surface, that’s when we're tapping those older carbon waters,” she says. “And that's what's worrisome.”

The deep waters are carbon-rich because of the microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton that live in the surface waters. The phytoplankton photosynthesize the CO₂ in the water into organic molecules to build their bodies. When they die, they sink to the ocean floor, sequestering the carbon for centuries. Some phytoplankton are consumed by larger organisms called zooplankton, which in turn are eaten by even bigger creatures whose carbon-rich fecal pellets and dead bodies can also end up on the ocean floor, burying ever more carbon in the deep waters.

The evidence from the SOCCOM floats suggests that it’s these deep waters that are upwelling during the Antarctic winters. “It's the old rotted water that normally takes hundreds of years to circulate out of the deep,” Russell says.

Scientists surmise that intensifying westerlies are bringing more of this carbon-rich deep water to the surface — but they need more evidence. One way to confirm that speedier westerlies have an impact on Southern Ocean outgassing, and thus on the levels of atmospheric CO₂, is to look at past climate evidence. Krystyna Saunders and her colleagues decided to look for some of that evidence on subantarctic Macquarie Island, which lies about 1,500 kilometers from Tasmania, midway between Australia and Antarctica. At latitude degrees 54S, it’s right in the main band of the westerlies.

Getting to Macquarie Island is no small feat, even on the Aurora Australis, a 311-foot-long icebreaker. Despite its size, the ship can be tossed around by massive swells, the kind Shackleton wrote about. “You can be lying down in your bunk, rolling from side to side and head to toe as the ship swirls around,” Saunders says. “If you get seasick like me, it’s quite horrible.”

On Macquarie Island, Saunders and her colleagues capitalized on a fortuitous natural record that provides clues to how strongly the winds around the island have blown in the past. That record lies at the bottom of Emerald Lake, a body of freshwater on the island’s western edge. It’s exposed to the westerlies and thus to salty ocean spray blown in by the winds: The greater the wind speeds, the higher the salinity of the lake. The salinity in turn affects which species of diatoms, types of algae, can thrive in the lake.

When they die, diatoms sink to the bottom of the lake and are buried in sediments on the lakebed, creating a layered chronicle of the salinity of the lake — and by proxy the speed of the winds. Saunders’ team extracted sediment cores from the lakebed, focusing on layers that had accumulated during the Holocene, the present epoch in Earth’s history that began about 11,700 years ago at the end of the last ice age.

Having inferred the speeds of westerlies over the course of the Holocene, they then looked at data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica to get a direct measure of the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere over that same time period. They found a clear correlation. “If you look at periods when the winds were above their average strengths, and periods when carbon dioxide was above its average concentration, they overlap,” Saunders says.

This has implications for our understanding of the effect the westerlies have on the Southern Ocean’s capacity to absorb carbon. Saunders’ study supports the idea that as the westerlies speed up, the Southern Ocean will outgas more CO₂ — as shown by Gray’s report on wintertime data collected by the SOCCOM floats — and goes against the analysis of 35 years of ship-based data by Landschützer’s team. Only more studies, along the lines of Landschützer’s attempt to reconcile the various datasets, will help resolve this debate.

There’s one more factor that could feed into the vicious cycle that scientists fear may already be underway in the Southern Ocean. Changes in the extensive Atlantic Ocean circulation system that includes the Gulf Stream may also be exacerbating the warming of the Southern Ocean, which in turn could be adding to the poleward shift and intensification of the westerlies.

This circulation system, called the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or AMOC, brings warm, salty surface water to the north, where it cools and sinks and then heads back to the Southern Hemisphere through deeper ocean layers. Scientists have found evidence that the AMOC has been slowing down, particularly in the last 150 years compared to the preceding 1,500 years. One indication of this is that particles being deposited on the ocean floor have been getting smaller and smaller: Fast-flowing water can whisk away smaller particles, allowing only the larger particles to settle, whereas slower water allows smaller and smaller particles to drop to the floor.

Some of the AMOC’s slowdown can be attributed to one of the consequences of global warming: an increasing supply of glacial meltwater into the North Atlantic. This fresh water reduces the salinity, and hence the density, of the surface waters. The formation of dense, salty, cold water is essential for it to sink down to the deep ocean in the North, from where it makes its return to the Southern Hemisphere. This process is being disrupted by climate change.

Since 2004, a project called RAPID has deployed moorings across the breadth and depth of the Atlantic at latitude degrees 26N (stretching from Florida to Morocco), to directly measure changes in the velocity of the AMOC. The measurements show that the current is indeed slowing down. But because of inherent decade-to-decade variations in the climate system, 15 years’ worth of direct measurements isn’t enough to establish a trend.

So Levke Caesar, then with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, and her colleagues extended this record back in time by using actual measurements of sea surface temperatures from 1870 to 2016, combined with a high-resolution climate model to reconstruct the strength of the AMOC over the past 150 years or so. Their work shows that the circulation system’s strength declined to a minimum around 1990, then grew until the early 2000s, and then started declining again. Other scientists have found similar results. As long as greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, “all climate models predict a slowdown of the AMOC,” Caesar says.

Because the AMOC transports heat from the south to the north, a slowdown effectively cools the Northern Hemisphere and heats up the Southern Hemisphere. This warming also intensifies the westerlies and shifts them toward the South Pole, leading to a greater vertical churning of the Southern Ocean, which may contribute to global warming by weakening the ocean’s ability to absorb CO₂. Since the likely result is even more glacial meltwater flowing into the North Atlantic, this could further weaken the AMOC. It has all the makings of a system that’s slipping out of control.

A similar runaway process is thought to have ended the last ice age, raising CO₂ levels from about 180 to 240 parts per million. This rise happened from about 17,500 years ago to 11,700 years ago, causing the deglaciation that made Earth more habitable. Atmospheric CO₂ levels are now past a whopping 410 ppm due to human activity, and rising. In a mere 250 years, we have increased CO₂ levels by more than the amount that melted an icy planet over thousands of years.

The winds are howling again over the Southern Ocean and are dangerously close to awakening a beast that, until now, has been helping us by absorbing copious amounts of carbon. But even the Southern Ocean is unlikely to cooperate forever.

289,"The global climate has been changing since time began and will continue to change into the future. The Earth's temperature has fluctuated in the last few hundred years. However, since around 1950 there has been a dramatic increase in global temperatures. This increase is known as global warming .

Ongoing temperature recordings using thermometers have shown a clear warming of the Earth's temperature over the past few decades. By using this data, scientists have seen an average combined land and ocean surface temperature increase of 0.85°C since the end of the 19th century. In the northern hemisphere, the period between 1983 and 2012 was the warmest 30-year period of the last 1,400 years. The degree to which the climate warms in the future will depend on natural climate variability and the level of greenhouse gas emissions. If greenhouse gas emissions continue then average global temperatures will rise. However, some regions such as the Arctic will warm faster than others.

Over the past 50 to 100 years, photographic evidence has shown that the world's glaciers have been melting, which has caused them to retreat. The increase in global temperatures is causing glaciers to disappear and is increasing the melting of sea ice in the Arctic.

Scientists often use ice cores to detect changes in temperatures. When snow falls it traps air into the ice. When scientists take a sample of ice it reveals the atmospheric gas concentrations at the time the snow fell. This is used to calculate temperature at that time. The ice can reveal the temperature of each year for the past 400,000 years. Scientists that study the ice cores say there is clear evidence that there has been a rapid increase in temperature in the past decades.

In recent years there have been signs of a seasonal shift - spring arrives earlier and winters tend to be less severe. These seasonal changes affect the nesting and migration patterns of wildlife.

721,"(CNN) A new United Nations report paints a bleak picture: The commitments countries pledged to limit the climate crisis are nowhere near enough to stave off record-high temperatures. Delaying change any further will make it impossible to reach desired temperature goals.

The time for ""rapid and transformational"" change to limit global warming is now, the report says.

Current measures will not keep global temperature increases within the 1.5-to-2-degree Celsius range (a ""safe"" level to which temperatures can rise and not cause devastation, though 1.5 degrees is preferable), according to the report issued Tuesday.

At the current rate, temperatures are expected to rise 3.2 degrees Celsius (5.8 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, the UNEP report states.

The changes the UNEP suggests are extreme: To get Earth back on track to the 1.5-degree goal, countries must multiply their commitment level, or the level at which they pledge to reduce their emissions, five times the current rates outlined in the Paris accords.

That means global greenhouse gas emissions must fall at least 7.6% every year to remove 32 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Incremental change is no longer enough to stall off the potentially devastating effects of a changing climate, the report's authors write.

What the world needs now, they say, is ""rapid and transformational action.""

G20 countries account for 78% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but only five of 20 member countries have set a date to reach net-zero emissions by. Of those, only two have created legislation to enforce those goals.

The US leads G20 countries in per-capita emissions, excluding greenhouse gases from land use, at just above 20 tons of carbon dioxide per capita in 2018.

And 2020 is a critical year for climate change: Countries will renegotiate their commitments at the UN climate change conference in Glasgow, but they'll have to take extensive action to avert a future crisis, said Anne Olhoff, the head of strategy in the UNEP's climate planning and policy division.

""They need to be significantly strengthened if we are to bridge or narrow the gap,"" she told CNN.

Some progress has been made in the years since the Paris Agreement: Six G20 member countries are projected to meet the commitments they made -- which means they have room to raise the ceiling for carbon removal even higher.

But drivers like economic growth, which is substantially higher than what was initially expected when the Paris Agreement was created, and population growth have ""more than outweighed good progress made on climate action,"" she said.

The report outlines some essential changes to chip away at emissions, including decarbonizing transport. Few countries have sufficient policies and actions in place to achieve this measure, Olhoff said, but establishing vehicle emission standards and investing in public transportation that runs on electricity are possible, if expensive, steps toward it.

Pricing carbon -- making major polluters pay for their emissions -- provides an incentive for major emitters to reduce their output.

It's often calculated from the price they extract from the public in terms of environmental damage or health care costs, though the countries that have already implemented this measure would need to hike up the cost, per the report.

Another measure, phasing out coal power plants, is more realistic now, Olhoff said. Renewable energy technology is increasingly affordable, with utility-scale solar power and wind turbines within competitive price of the operating costs of existing coal plants.

""There's really no big argument for not going full-force at renewable energy,"" she said.

Environmental recalibration will require fundamental structural changes across most of the world, the report acknowledges. It won't be cheap.

Climate policies consistent with the 1.5-degree goal could cost up to $3.6 trillion per year globally, according to the UNEP. But the cost likely outweighs the consequences of inaction.

The adaptations humankind would need to make to survive in a world where temperatures have risen more than 1.5 degrees Celsius would seriously damage the global economy and reduce food security and biodiversity, according to the report.

What's more, delaying action further would force global powers to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a magnitude that current technology and resources haven't caught up with yet, the report warns.

""Climate protection and adaptation investments will become a precondition for peace and stability,"" the report's authors write, and will require ""unprecedented"" efforts to transform nearly every sector of society.

There's growing demand from the public to see those changes implemented, Olhoff said. The difficult part is executing change in such a way that doesn't disrupt society completely.

It's worked for some: Olhoff offered South Africa as an example, as it's made gradual but important progress in phasing out coal power plants. But in India, where coal leads the energy market and powers the economy, a change that drastic would result in social upheaval.

The flight shaming movement has raised our awareness of air travel’s contribution to climate change. With all the discussion, you might be surprised to learn that air travel globally only accounts for about 3% of the warming human activities are causing. Why all the fuss?

Before I explain, I should come clean. I am writing this on the train from Christchurch to Kaikoura, where I will give a talk about my recent book #NoFly: walking the talk on climate change. I have some skin in this game.

Taking a train around New Zealand is no mean feat. In the North Island, the train between Auckland and Wellington runs only every second day. If you get off at a stop along the way, you have to wait another two days to continue your journey. You can catch a bus, but you’ll spend that bus journey fantasising about the possibility of an overnight train service.

So why do it? A good deal of global carbon emissions come from industrial processes or electricity generation under the control of governments and corporations, rather than individual citizens. For many of us, a decision not to fly might be the most significant reduction in emissions we can make as individuals.

As Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has shown, refusing to fly also sends a powerful signal to others, by showing that you are willing to change your own behaviour. Politicians and corporate sales departments will take note if we start acting together.

Aviation affects the climate in a variety of ways.

Because any carbon dioxide you emit stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, it doesn’t matter much whether you release it from the exhaust pipe of your car at sea level or from a jet engine several kilometres high. Per passenger, a flight from Auckland to Wellington will put a similar amount of carbon dioxide into the air as driving solo in your car. Catching the train will cut your carbon emissions seven-fold.

When aircraft burn jet fuel, however, they also emit short-lived gases like nitrogen oxides, which can react with other gases in the air within a day of being released. When nitrogen oxides are released at altitude they can react with oxygen to put more ozone into the air, but can also remove methane.

Ozone and methane are both greenhouse gases, so this chain of chemical reactions can lead to both heating and cooling effects. Unfortunately the net result when these processes are added together is to drive more warming.

Depending on the atmospheric conditions, aircraft can also create contrails: clouds of tiny ice crystals. The science is not as clear cut on how contrails influence the climate, but some studies suggest they could have an effect as significant as the carbon dioxide released during a flight.

There is also considerable uncertainty as to whether aircraft exhaust might affect cloud formation itself - this could be a further significant contribution to warming.

Read more: Climate explained: why don't we have electric aircraft?

Offsetting, by planting trees or restoring natural wildlands, will take carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere. But we would have to do this on a massive scale to feed our appetite for flight.

Emissions from international air travel are not included in the Paris Agreement, although the United Nations has been working on the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which may begin to deal with these. Initially, the scheme will be voluntary. Airlines flying routes between countries that join the scheme will have to offset any emissions above 2020 levels from January 2021.

Emissions from flying stand to triple by 2050 if demand for air travel continues to grow. Even if air travel became carbon neutral through the use of biofuels or electric planes, the effects from contrails and interactions with clouds mean that flying may never be climate neutral.

With no easy fixes on the horizon, many people are thinking hard about their need to fly. This is why I took a year off air travel (alongside my colleague Quentin Atkinson) in 2018.

I have been back on planes in 2019, but I have learned how to reduce my flying, by combining trips and making better use of video conferencing.

233,"AN ENORMOUS ice sheet is at risk of melting even if temperatures rise by just 2°C, potentially sparking major climate chaos.

Scientists say that if the East Antarctic Ice Sheet –which is 60 times the size of England – melts, sea levels could rise by four metres, putting areas of the UK at risk of disappearing entirely.

Experts are now warning that more needs to be done to prevent continued global warming.

Melting ice can have a devastating effect on the world, causing the planet to heat up more quickly, changing ocean circulation systems that regulate global weather, and increasing the risk of flooding and tsunamis damage.

A study into historical ice loss suggests even ""moderate warming"" of Earth could melt the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

""With current global temperatures already one degree higher than during pre-industrial times, future ice loss seems inevitable if we fail to reduce carbon emissions,"" said Dr David Wilson, of Imperial College London, who worked on the research.

Scientists have poured lots of effort into investigating the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which mostly sits on land below sea level.

Due to its low-lying position, it contributes to most of the continent's ice melt today.

But experts at Imperial College London and the University of Queensland have now investigated risks facing the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

The EAIS is the largest ice sheet on Earth, and poses a major hazard if it disappears.

Now a study in Nature suggests that 2°C of warming over ""a couple of millennia"" could cause significant melting of the EAIS.

""Antarctica is around twice the size of Australia, with ice sheets several kilometres thick and containing around half of the world's fresh water,"" said Dr Kevin Welsh, at the University of Queensland, a co-author on the study.

""The East Antarctic Ice Sheet covers about two thirds of the area, and because its base is largely above sea level it was generally thought to be less sensitive to warming climates than the adjacent West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

""However, some areas – like the Wilkes Land Subglacial Basin, directly south of Australia – are below sea level and contain enough ice to raise global sea levels by several metres.

""The evidence we have suggests that with the predicted 2°C warming in Antarctica – if sustained over a couple of millennia – the sheet would start melting in these locations.""

Glaciers, which are created by ice sheets, grind up rocks on land.

These rocks are then transported into the nearby Southern Ocean as sediment. This creates a record of earlier erosion by the ice sheet.

Researchers chemically analysed layers of sediment from the ocean floor, which would have originated from the Wilkes Subglacial Basin – collected as part of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program.

The study looked at sediment layers that had settled on the seafloor during the four warm intervals occurring between ice ages over the last 450,000 years.

""Studying ice sheet behaviour in the geological past can inform us about future changes,"" said Dr Wilson.

""By building a picture of how the ice sheet has grown and shrunk as temperatures have fluctuated, we can understand the response of the EAIS to future warming.""

The team found chemical ""fingerprints"" in the sediment which revealed the patterns of erosion as the ice sheet advanced and retreated.

It turned out that the ice sheet had retreated from its current size during some of these warmer ""interglacial"" periods, between 125,000 and 400,000 years ago.

Importantly, at the time, temperatures were as little as two degrees warmer than pre-industrial times – and one degree warmer than today.

During these warmer periods, global sea levels were between six and 13 metres higher than they are today.

According to researchers, if all the ice in the Wilkes Subglacial Basin melted in modern times, global sea levels would rise by up to four metres.

""We found that the most extreme changes in the ice sheet occurred during two interglacial periods 125,000 and 400,000 years ago, when global sea levels were several metres higher than they are today,"" Dr Walsh explained.

""These periods could be analogues for future climates and it seems likely that ice loss from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet contributed to those higher sea levels.

""Ice loss contributes to rising global sea levels which are a threat to many coastal communities, and making projections requires a solid understanding of how sensitive these ice sheets are.""

One of the biggest concerns about rising sea levels is the risk than smaller, more common tsunamis could have a more damaging effect than they do today.

Last month, scientists issued a warning about the risk of “devastating tsunamis” caused by climate change.

Research in Science Advances suggested that rising sea levels – caused by global warming – significantly increase the threat of giant killer waves.

Experts modelled the impact of tsunamis based on sea level increases, and discovered worrying results.

It found that rising sea levels allowed tsunamis to reach much further inland, significantly increasing the risk of floods.

This means small tsunamis that might not be deadly today could wreak havoc in the future.

“Our research shows that sea-level rise can significantly increase the tsunami hazard, which means that smaller tsunamis in the future can have the same adverse impacts as big tsunamis would today,” said Robert Weiss, a professor of geosciences at Virginia Tech.

And if you think Britain is safe from tsunamis, think again.

Earlier this week, research revealed that deadly tsunamis crashing into the UK is more common than previously thought.

Scientists believe three killer waves have hit the UK within the last 10,000 years – raising the possibility that another one may be due.

We already knew about one of these: around 8,200 years ago, the Storegga submarine landslide off the coast of Norway sparked a 20-metre high tsunami that swept across Shetland.

1142,"The aim of the current paper is to update the previous study on climate change fingerprints in European phenology and include as many plant species/phenophases as are available. Recent publications have exclusively focused on a few prominent spring leaf unfolding phases and results of those may be strongly related to the choice of analysed species, having different sensitivities and covering different seasons. Phenology is controlled by seasonal patterns in the warming signal (Lapenis et al., 2014 ) and these will vary by location (spatial differences in the climate signal) and study period (temporal differences in the climate signal, e.g. Rutishauser et al., 2009 ). Consequently, this update is more than timely since the climate signal has not been stable, but temporal variations or trends in climate change have been reported, especially related to the so called hiatus or standstill period (Zang, Jochner‐Oette, Cortés, Rammig, & Menzel, 2019 ). A publication has already indicated that there were no trends in spring and autumn phenology during this warming hiatus period (Wang et al., 2019 ). Another phenological regime shift in the mid‐1980s was also related to discontinuous temperature changes (Reid et al., 2016 ).

Temperature sensitivity has also been shown to vary with specific plant traits, such as evolutionary relatedness, and to support invasions and plant performance (e.g. Wolkovich, Cook, & Davies, 2014 ). For wheat and maize in agriculture there are hints of geographic differences among cultivars in sensitivity to vernalization, day length and temperature (Van Bussel, Stehfest, Siebert, Müller, & Ewert, 2015 ). However, there are still major knowledge gaps concerning the so‐called ‘false’ phenological phases, such as sowing or harvesting in agriculture, whose timings are decided by farmers. The GCB2006 study and follow‐up publications provided the first evidence that the phenological signal in agriculture was weaker than the signal for wild growing plant species (Bock, Sparks, Estrella, & Menzel, 2013 ; Estrella, Sparks, & Menzel, 2007 ; Menzel, Sparks, Estrella, Koch, et al., 2006 ; Menzel, Vopelius, Estrella, Schleip, & Dose, 2006 ). However, it can be anticipated that, sooner or later, agricultural management and/or choice of cultivars will also be adapted to the new potential growing seasons. The drivers of autumn phenology, such as leaf colouring and leaf fall, are still far from being completely understood (Estrella & Menzel, 2006 ; Gallinat, Primack, & Wagner, 2016 ; Gill et al., 2015 ; Wu et al., 2018 ).

Major factors that may impact on the results of this update are different changes in (apparent) temperature sensitivity (e.g. Fu, Piao, et al., 2015 ; Fu, Zhao, et al., 2015 ). Species‐specific increases in heat requirements related to a decrease in chilling have been especially identified as the main reason (Fu, Piao, et al., 2015 ). However, there are also contrasting opinions for example, by Wang et al. ( 2017 ). Güsewell, Furrer, Gehrig, and Pietragalla ( 2017 ) showed that for Switzerland there are still no indications of a lack of chilling leading to altered temperature sensitivities. Changes in temperature sensitivities are reported as not uniform over time (Chen et al., 2019 ) and, in particular, a weakened temperature response was observed since 2000 (Fu et al., 2014 ). Spatial variations in temperature sensitivity have been linked to mean annual temperature and to seasonal temperature range (Lapenis, Henry, Vuille, & Mower, 2014 ; Menzel, Sparks, Estrella, & Roy, 2006 ; Wang et al., 2014 ). Both major backup systems to prevent a premature spring development (chilling, photoperiod) may finally lead to nonlinear responses of phenological onset dates to forcing temperatures (Jochner, Sparks, Laube, & Menzel, 2016 ).

Thus, the well‐accepted role of phenology as a climate change indicator is based on the formal attribution of shifted phenological onset dates to anthropogenic‐induced warming (Rosenzweig et al., 2007 , 2008 ), demonstrating at the same time that the phenological trends are not just natural variability, for example, as shown by Guan ( 2014 ) for two phenophases which unequivocally corresponded to the respective winter/spring warming trends. Most studies, however, rely on proof of the sensitivity of phenological phases to temperature as the fundamental prerequisite of climate change detection and attribution, and have linked phenological changes to temperature increases (e.g. Cook et al., 2012 ; Thackeray et al., 2016 ). Since there is thorough evidence that spring phenological development is also partially triggered by fulfilment of winter chilling and by photoperiod (e.g. Laube et al., 2014 ; Tang et al., 2016 ; Vitasse & Basler, 2013 ), it is debated whether phenological changes still mirror the recent ongoing warming, or mirror it to the same extent as before. Therefore, an update of the assessment of phenological changes across Europe and their attribution to climate change is necessary. In contrast to the GCB2006 publication, this update will uniquely concentrate on plant phenology.

Although plant phenology is one of the oldest forms of environmental monitoring, with phenological observations taken by ancient civilizations (Koch et al., 2007 ; Schwartz, 2003 ), it was only in the 1990s that its renaissance started with key publications on detection of climate change impacts on global vegetation. Keeling, Chin, and Whorf ( 1996 ) were the first to report a 7 day earlier start of the growing season based on long‐term measurements of atmospheric CO 2 concentration, which Myneni, Keeling, Tucker, Asrar, and Nemani ( 1997 ) confirmed using normalized difference vegetation index satellite data from the Northern Hemisphere. Menzel and Fabian ( 1999 ) then provided the necessary ground truth by their analyses of long‐term European phenological data. Many other papers, summarized in well‐cited reviews and relevant chapters in IPCC reports (e.g. Rosenzweig et al., 2007 ; Walther et al., 2002 ), confirmed the extraordinary role of phenology as a bio‐indicator of climate change. While research initially focused purely on the identification of changes, it then extended to communication of climate change to the general public (e.g. Van Vliet et al., 2003 ) as well as on various ecological consequences of these changes (Morisette et al., 2009 ; Thackeray et al., 2010 ). Nevertheless, at the beginning of this renewed research there was a latent accusation of a publication bias, or cherry picking, in the sense that only the most advancing records or extraordinary changes found their way into popular scientific journals. Therefore, the COST725 initiative collected all available European phenological data (later developed as the PEP725 database, Templ et al., 2018 ) and analysed more than 100,000 time series for climate change‐driven changes (Menzel, Sparks, Estrella, Koch, et al., 2006 , hereafter referred as GCB2006). The GCB2006 study concluded that there was indeed a strong response in European phenology to climate change and that these changes matched the warming pattern. With more than 1,500 citations in the Web of Science Core Collection, this study has a high relevance for the scientific discourse on climate change impacts on the biosphere. It was also the backbone of the corresponding assessment of observed changes and responses in natural and managed systems of AR4 WGII of the IPCC (Rosenzweig et al., 2007 ) as well as of the subsequent paper of attribution of global impacts in nature to anthropogenic warming (Rosenzweig et al., 2008 ).

Second, we applied a spatial approach based on all sites for which we tested the effect of the corresponding temperature trends on all phenological trends. For this we divided all (significant as well as non‐significant) temperature trends in terciles (below, average, above) on a seasonal basis and the phenological trends by sign and significance (negative significant, negative nonsignificant, positive nonsignificant, positive significant). A frequency analysis was performed on this cross tabulation using Chi‐square tests and p ‐values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the FDR. Pearson (standardized) residuals for each cell were determined to assess their relative contribution to the total Chi‐square score.

Attribution followed the methods proposed by Rosenzweig et al. ( 2007 , 2008 ). First, based on statistically significant trends only, the percentage of significant trends (out of all significant trends) matching the direction expected from climate warming was determined, both for the phenological groups of GCB2006 and of Update. According to IPCC likelihood terminology, >66% probability corresponds to ‘likely’, >90% to ‘very likely’, and >95% to ‘extremely likely’.

In the results section, the model coefficients are visualized using so‐called effect plots, which plot the predicted effect of each explanatory variable on the outcome. This makes comparisons easier with respect to the different units and range of the explanatory variables, and allows the identification of interaction terms and smooth terms. The effect of each variable is calculated by holding all other variables constant (except for interactions). The models were fitted in R statistical software version 3.6 using the mgcv‐package (Wood, 2017 ), effects were calculated using the emmeans‐package (Lenth, 2019 ), and results were visualized using the ggplot2‐package (Wickham, 2016 ).

In order to understand what the partial contribution of explanatory factors to the observed phenological trend was, we followed a modelling approach. Explanatory factors/variables were the nine clusters (cluster9, see Table 2 ), topography (longitude, latitude and elevation), traits (woodiness, pollination mode), start year of records and number of recorded years. A symbolic description of the generalized additive model (composed of linear, nonlinear/smooth and factorial terms) iswhere cluster9, woodiness and pollination mode are factorial variables (encoded as dummies in the model) with levels indicated as above (cluster9), woody or nonwoody (woodiness), wind or insect (pollination mode); all other variables are numeric; start year and number years were included as smooth functions (denoted with prefix s; using penalized splines); all other numeric variables were included with linear coefficients; interaction terms are denoted by *.

Furthermore, the overall mean onset dates (DOY mean ) and mean temperature ( T mean ) over the whole time period (1951–2018) for each phenological series (per species/phase/station) were calculated and aggregated in weeks to study the phenological anomalies from the average. Every 10 year time block (1950s, 1960s and so on) was selected and the corresponding DOY mean and T mean were again calculated for the corresponding weeks of the year. The deviations of DOY mean and T mean from the overall mean were considered as the phenological anomalies and 95% confidence intervals for each week in each time block were calculated. For each decade we used loess smoothing of the temperature anomalies and inverted the y ‐axis for better visual comparison with the phenological anomalies.

Phenological changes were determined as linear regressions of onset days (DOY) against year for all series (i.e. 30+ years in Update). For GCB2006s (1971–2000), similar to GCB2006, all 15+ year series were considered. p values of the linear regression slopes were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false‐discovery‐rate (FDR; Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995 ). Proportions of (significant) negative/(significant) positive trends and mean slopes (Tr mean ) were determined for the different categories described in Table 2 . The uncertainty range of Tr mean is the 95% confidence interval for estimating the mean (of the slopes), and not the 95% interval of the underlying data. Thus, the range is equivalent to the 95% CI of a one‐sample t test. Trends were also determined for moving 30 year blocks over the whole study period where 15+ years of valid data existed. The mean slope per category and 30 year block was then calculated to assess the varying trend strength over time. Daily mean temperature ( T mean ) was extracted and processed into annual and seasonal averages (DJF winter, MAM spring, JJA summer, SON autumn) in order to calculate the respective linear annual and seasonal temperature trends over the entire 1951–2018 time period for Update based on the geographical coordinates of each phenological station.

The E‐OBS v19.0HOM gridded data set with a 0.25 degree regular grid (Cornes, Schrier, Besselaar, & Jones, 2018 ), which is the homogenized version of E‐OBS v19.0e and thus more suitable to derive long‐term trends, was used for extracting the daily mean temperature for all stations during 1951–2018. It was additionally adjusted for station‐specific elevation by using the elevation difference between the station and the average of the climatic grid cell derived from the global raster Digital Elevation Model, the Global 30 Arc‐Second Elevation Data Set (GTOPO30) together with E‐OBS v19.0HOM, based on a temperature lapse rate of 6.4°C/km (see also Ma et al., 2019 ; Olsson & Jönsson, 2014 ).

In the previous GCB2006 study comprising ~100,000 series in the period 1971–2000 plant phenological series were categorized into four groups (see Table 2 ). For Update and GCB2006s, we further refined this categorization into nine clusters, taking into account BBCH coding of phases (Meier, 1997 ) as well as farming activities, and additionally defined four periods/seasons, different from those in GCB2006.

It is important to notice that a direct comparison between GCB2006 and the updated results is not straightforward since some differences in phenophases and data selection procedure exist. Thus a GCB2006s (s = simulated) data set was defined as a subset of Update containing identical species/phases/stations, but restricted to the GCB2006 period and series length (1971–2000, 15+ years). This simulation of GCB2006 conditions in Update allowed studying the effects of ongoing climate change post‐2000 as well as methodological aspects (15+ vs. 30+ year series), when comparing Update and GCB2006s results. In contrast, GCB2006 results are only reported and discussed with respect to possible effects due to some different sites/phenophases in GCB2006s.

For data correction (following e.g. Chen et al., 2018 , 2019 ; Ma, Huang, Hänninen, & Berninger, 2019 ; Vitasse, Signarbieux, & Fu, 2018 ), we filtered out in each series those observations outside the range median ± 3.5 × MAD (median absolute deviation), which is definitely a more than conservative approach (see Leys, Ley, Klein, Bernard, & Licata, 2013 ; Miller, 1991 ), since only the extreme values considered absolutely wrong were excluded (in our case less than 0.7% of the data).

Out of the complete phenological data from these countries, we took observational data between 1951 and 2018 with time series (series per species/phase/station) longer than 29 years and ending in or after 2000. Duplicates were removed by averaging the respective DOYs (onset dates as day of the year) in the same year. Very early phenological events (e.g. hazel or snowdrop flowering in December) were allocated to the correct reference year by negative DOYs.

Unfortunately, it was not possible to directly update the GCB2006 data set due to a lack of access to the recent phenological data of specific countries. However, data from Germany, Austria and Switzerland constituted around 96.7% of the GCB2006 data set. Thus, it is justified to consider the new data set as comparable.

Complete original plant phenological observation data were retrieved individually from the European Meteorological Services of Germany (DWD), Austria (ZAMG) and Switzerland (MeteoSwiss). Data of these countries account for 96.3% of the PEP database (Templ et al., 2018 ), thus our results are comparable to any other based on PEP725 data. However, these national phenological databases are richer in sites, species and phenophases; therefore, although having a smaller spatial extent, are preferred for this study (see map in Figure S1 a).

Attribution of phenological trends for the nine clusters (see Table 2 ) to trends in seasonal temperatures by Chi‐squared test (absolute numbers are given in Figure S4 ). Pearson residuals indicate the relative contribution of a cell to the total Chi‐square. Crossed out combinations were not significant (‐values adjusted for multiple comparisons of 4 * 9 = 36 tests by FDR). The size of the circle is proportional to the amount of the contribution, green indicates positive residuals, which specify a positive association between phenological and temperature trends, and light grey implies a repulsion or negative association [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com

Concerning the spatial match of temperature trends to all phenological trends, results of the Chi‐square tests indicated that for all phenological clusters, except crop vegetative development in spring (Cv sp ) as well as ripening phases of fruit trees and wild plant species in summer (FWg su ), there was at least one significant association of phenological trends with seasonal warming patterns in winter/spring/summer (Figure 5 ; Figure S4 ). Crop generative development in spring (Cg sp ) was significantly associated with winter and spring warming patterns, and the respective spring phases in fruit trees and wild plant species (FWv sp , FWg sp ) even displayed a stronger positive association (see Figure S4 ). For the latter two, counterintuitively average and above average summer temperature trends were associated with delayed (subsequent) spring phenophases. Above average warming in winter and spring was significantly associated with delayed leaf colouring and leaf fall (FWv au ). For farmers’ activities, the Chi‐square tests indicated that advancing spring activities (F sp ) were significantly linked with above average warming in winter, but below average warming in summer. For farmers’ summer activities, above average warming in summer and autumn was associated with advancing summer trends (F su ). In contrast, below average warming in summer was connected to advancing autumn activities (F au ).

About 96% and 95% of the significant changes of leaf unfolding and flowering (b1) and fruit ripening (b2), respectively, were negative, thus indicating advancing onset dates with warming (see Table 3 ). For farmers’ activities, 83% of the significant trends were negative. Significant leaf colouring and leaf fall trends (b3 in Table 3 , FWv au in Table S1 a) were 63% positive, hinting to delayed autumn with warming. This pattern is confirmed by the corresponding analysis for the spring and summer clusters (data from Table S1 a): 95%, 98%, 98%, 98%, 92% and 91% of their significant trends (Cv sp , Cg sp , FWv sp , FWg sp , FWg su , F su ) were negative and matched the warming signal. Only 89% and 78% of the significant trends of farming activities in spring and autumn were advancing. Thus, advancing farming activities are likely, phenological phases in summer are very likely and phenological phases in spring, such as leaf unfolding and flowering, are even extremely likely to be attributable to increasing temperatures.

(a) Factorial variables of nine clusters and of selected plant species traits with 95% confidence intervals, (b) start year and number of years as smooth functions with penalized splines with 95% confidence intervals, (c) topographical variables interacting with phenological clusters

Since phenological trends varied with phenological group (Table 3 ) and cluster (Figure 1 ), year (Figure 2 ), season (Figure 3 ) and length of the series (Table 3 ), these variables, as well as geographical coordinates and species traits, were used in the generalized additive model. The following reported values are model estimates, and their uncertainty relates to the uncertainty in estimating the model (i.e. confidence intervals do not cover the variability of the data, but the uncertainty in estimating the mean values). The results (Figure 4 ) indicate that all phenological clusters except leaf colouring and leaf fall (FWv au ) exhibited negative trends of on average −0.224 days/year. Only farmers’ activities had smaller negative trends: in spring −0.126 days/year (95% CI: −0.136, −0.116) and autumn −0.128 days/year (−0.138, −0.118). Flowering of fruit trees and wild plant species in spring, FWg sp , −0.277 days/year (−0.284, −0.270), and vegetative development of agricultural crops in spring, Cv sp , −0.317 days/year (−0.328, −0.306), had stronger trends. For species traits, the models showed that nonwoody insect‐pollinated species had smaller trends with −0.150 days/year (−0.159, −0.142) than the other three combinations (on average −0.210 days/year). There was no obvious effect of the length of the phenological series on trends. However, the start of the series mattered: Series starting at the end of the 1970s were linked to the strongest advancing trends, while earlier and later starting series were associated to less strong advancing trends. For many clusters there was a mixed effect of longitude on trends, and clear negative effects of latitude and elevation; however, the largest impacts were seen for elevation. The average effect on phenological trends of latitude was −0.010 days/year per degree latitude and for elevation −0.140 days/year per km elevation, thus higher elevations were consistently associated with stronger advancing trends.

This reverse order was equally apparent in mean weekly temperature anomalies (Figure S3 b) where the 1991–2000 decade exhibited the warmest weekly temperatures and the 2011–2018 decade the coldest ones, but from week 4 to 8, thus 6 weeks prior to the leafing/flowering phenological response. In general anomalies in T mean varied more strongly from week to week mirroring the more fluctuating weather/temperature (Figure S3 b). For leaf colouring and fall (FWv au ) the 1951–1960 decade had the earliest onset dates, thus, it is likely that the inclusion of this decade in Update (1951–2018) triggered the now delaying autumn trends. Farmers’ activities in spring and summer (F sp , F su ) only exhibited earlier than average starting dates in the last and the two last decades respectively.

Mean decadal phenological anomalies across weeks of the year (Figures S2 and S3 a) allow deeper insights into the trend structure. The spring and summer clusters (uppermost five panels in Figure S3 a) provide a text book example of climate change‐driven changes in phenology: In the last four decades the weekly mean anomalies gradually decreased, whereas respective decadal anomalies of weekly mean temperatures increased. Interestingly, during week 10–13 the anomalies of leaf unfolding and flowering of fruit trees and wild plant species in spring (FWv sp , FWg sp ) displayed a reverse order of the last three decades: 1991–2000 had the earliest mean onset dates, 2011–2018 the least early ones.

Respective spring phases for crops (Cv sp , Cg sp ) advanced more strongly than for fruit trees and wild plant species before week 20 and less strongly afterwards. In summer, from week 28 onwards, fruit ripening in fruit trees and wild plant species (FWg su ), as well as ripening of crops and harvest dates in agriculture (F su ), exhibited similar advancing trends. However, before that, in early summer (week 22 to 28), farmers’ activities were more strongly advancing than contemporaneous ripening phases in FWg su . Farmers’ activities in early autumn from mid‐August to end of September were almost unchanged, whereas in October a clear advancing response to warming was visible.

Plotting mean trends over weeks of the year (Figure 3 ) clearly exhibits systematic variations with season. Only weeks covered by less data points at the beginning or end of record had wider confidence intervals of the mean trends. In autumn, trends of delayed leaf colouring and leaf fall (b3 in Figure 3 a, FWv au in Figure 3 b) increased from week 36 to 47, suggesting that sites or species with later senescence were delayed more. During the first 3 months of the year (week 4–12), advance in flowering of first fruit trees and wild plant species (FWg sp in Figure 3 b) decreased distinctly, indicating that strongest advances in spring phenology were observed for early flowering species and/or very warm sites. The more detailed clusters show that the advance of leaf unfolding of fruit trees and wild plant species (FWv sp in Figure 3 b) was stable across the weeks 11–23, matching those of FWg sp . Consequently, when adjusted for identical weeks in spring, there were no differences in trends between generative and vegetative phases.

Quite clearly, these changes in the intensity of phenological changes overtime were related to temperature changes. Slopes of mean annual temperature warming increased in time till 1978–2007 (+0.0582 ± 0.0004°C/year), and for the last block (1989–2018) they only reached +0.0344 ± 0.0004°C/year (Figure 2 d). This picture was also true for all single seasons except autumn.

The recorded changes of the four periods (GS, FWgP, FS, CgP) differed substantially (Figure 2 c). The growing season (GS) was clearly prolonged for all 30 year periods ending after 1989, exhibiting a maximum slope of +0.428 ± 0.016 days/year for the period 1976–2005 and a considerably smaller one of +0.215 ± 0.017 days/year for the final 30 year block. The generative period of fruit trees and wild plant species (FWgP) showed almost no changes in any direction, thus was stable across the study period. The FS, defined as the period between first and last farmers’ activities, and the crop generative period (CgP) were predominantly shortened for the 30 year periods ending after 1989, both reaching mean slopes of −0.449 ± 0.048 and −0.143 ± 0.038 days/year, respectively, in the final 30 year period.

The approach of calculating trends over moving 30 year windows across the whole study period 1951–2018 clearly indicated time‐varying changes in onset dates (Figure 2 ). Until the end year of 1988 slopes were stable and positive for most phenogroups (Figure 2 a) and clusters (Figure 2 b) indicating delayed onsets. Advancing onsets were only determined for some phenophases related to agriculture (Cv sp , F sp , F au , i.e. development of crops in spring, sowing of spring crops and winter cereals). After the end year of 1989, slopes for leaf colouring and leaf fall (b3 in Figure 2 a, FWv au in Figure 2 b) oscillated around zero, whereas for all other groups/clusters the trends were becoming more and more negative. The minimum slopes (i.e. strongest advancing trends) were reached around 1979–2008 and the most pronounced advancing mean trend of −0.553 ± 0.004 days/year was recorded for flowering phases of fruit trees and wild plant species in spring (FWg sp ). Afterwards, trends became weaker again, especially for spring leaf unfolding and flowering of fruit trees and wild plant species (FWv sp, FWg sp ). Finally, for the most recent 30 year period (1989–2018) they were all less than half of their maximum in the 1980s to 2010s although still negative (Cv sp −0.214 ± 0.018, Cg sp −0.237 ± 0.010, FWv sp −0.098 ± 0.007, FWg sp −0.080 ± 0.005, FWg su −0.232 ± 0.010, F su −0.179 ± 0.009, F au −0.075 ± 0.012 days/year) except for F sp (+0.018 ± 0.013 days/year).

About 84% of the series indicated a lengthening of the growing season (GS, from leaf unfolding to colouring) and 48% were significantly longer (Figure 1 b). The mean trend was +0.261 ± 0.008 days/year. The farming season (FS, period of farmers’ activities from spring to autumn) shortened by −0.149 ± 0.022 days/year with two‐thirds of the trends being negative. Although the generative period for agricultural crops (CgP, from flowering to ripeness) was definitively shortened (−0.205 ± 0.019 days/year, 78% negative), there was no clear change pattern for fruit trees and wild plants (FWgP, from flowering to ripeness; see Table S1 b). The average trend was almost zero with roughly equal numbers of the series showing a shortening or lengthening of the generative period.

Undoubtedly ~3/4 of the farmers’ spring and summer activities (F sp sowing of spring cereals, F su harvest) were advancing (74% and 84%, respectively) and the percentages of significant advances clearly increased from GCB2006s to Update (14%–31% and 24%–53%, respectively). For farmers’ sowing of autumn crops (F au ), more advanced than delayed series were observed; however, the picture was still similar to GCB2006s except that more trends (both advances and delays) were significant (Figure 1 a; Table S1 a). Surprisingly, mean slopes became less negative, except for F sp which advanced more strongly in Update than in GCB2006s (−0.116 ± 0.005 vs. −0.075 ± 0.011 days/year).

For the nine clusters, trends in terms of sign, proportions of significant trends and mean slope are summarized in Figure 1 (corresponding numbers are given in Table S1 a,b). Except for FWv au which comprises leaf colouring and fall in fruit trees and wild species in autumn, the overall change pattern in all other clusters was advancing. All spring and summer clusters had higher percentages of negative and significant negative trends in Update than in GCB2006s (Figure 1 a), for example, ~90% of the four climate‐driven spring categories (Cv sp , Cg sp , FWv sp , FWg sp ) advanced (86%, 90%, 92% and 91%, respectively), up to 60% significantly. Interestingly, for ripening in fruit trees and wild species in summer (FWg su ), the percentage was slightly smaller with 81% (46% significantly) advanced, although this pattern also intensified from GCB2006s to Update. In contrast, the mean slopes of the spring and summer phenological groups (Cv sp , Cg sp , FWv sp , FWg sp and FWg su ) very clearly indicated throughout smaller advances in Update than in GCB2006s. This decrease in trend strength was also quite large, for example, −0.428 ± 0.004 days/year for FWg sp in GCB2006s compared to only −0.254 ± 0.002 days/year in Update (Figure 1 c; Table S1 a).

For leaf unfolding and flowering, fruiting and farmers’ activities, the percentage of negative trends slightly increased, for example from 87% (GCB2006s) to 89% advanced for leaf unfolding and flowering (Table 3 ). The percentage of expected, delayed trends for leaf colouring increased from 49% (GCB2006s) to 57%. Longer (30+ years) series led to considerably higher proportions of significantly advancing trends (e.g. 54% of leaf unfolding and flowering series compared to 30% in GCB2006s). While GCB2006 as well as GCB2006s indicated a less clear pattern for both farmers’ activities and leaf colouring, the direction of changes was more obvious in Update with farmers’ activities being mostly advanced (72%) and leaf colouring predominantly delayed (57%). Though the phenological change signal in terms of the proportion of significant trends increased, the mean advance in days per year was considerably weaker than in GCB2006s. For example, the mean slope for leaf unfolding and flowering was –0.394 ± 0.003 days/year (95% confidence intervals) in GCB2006s and only −0.240 ± 0.002 days/year in Update.

The update of the GCB2006 study almost two decades later has clearly revealed that there is still a significant climate change pattern in European plant phenology. Since a direct comparison of the almost 97,000 Update series to the GCB2006 ones was not possible, we simulated GCB2006s results based on Update to study the effects of ongoing climate change after 2000 as well as of longer series (15+ vs. 30+ years). Differences in the trend structure of GCB2006 and GCB2006s suggested that any results of trends analyses may also partly be driven by the set of species and phenophases included. In our case a considerable adjustment in the observational programme of the DWD in 1991 has led to a substantial reduction in the number of (agricultural) species/phases when series were selected to end in 2000 or later. ZAMG data selection mirrors a similar decrease of observations in the last two decades (see Figure S1b).

In the following the results will be discussed with respect to the three guiding research questions. There is still a clear picture of phenological advance except for autumn. For the vegetative and generative phases of crops, fruit trees and wild plants, longer time series (30+ years in Update) led to ≥90% advancing trends in spring (Cg , FWv , FWg ), ≥81% for Cv and FWg , and ~75% for the farmers’ activities in these seasons (F , F ). Accordingly, at least 30+ year series are needed for robust trend estimations (Dose & Menzel, 2004; Rosenzweig et al., 2007) as also confirmed by our trend modelling. Longer series were also linked to a higher percentage of significant trends, but assuming comparable variability and change rates, greater statistical power would be expected to lead to an increase in significance.

Although the proportion of trends that was significant increased, mean advances of spring and summer phases decreased in the extended period beyond 2000, especially for fruit trees and wild plants, but also to a lesser degree for crops. This confirms findings of a review by Piao et al. (2019) of decelerated or even reversed trends in recent years. Only farmers’ spring activities exhibited a stronger advance (−0.116 ± 0.005 days/year) in Update which is well explained by considerably earlier dates in 2011–2018 as shown in the anomaly plots. It was not the aim of our paper to disentangle the contribution of the obvious reasons for this result, but the moving window approach clearly showed that spring and winter warming trends exhibited very similar variation overtime, that is, the strongest trends in the 1980–2010 period. Thus, it is more likely that a reduction in forcing conditions has driven the decrease in the advance of spring and summer phenology (as reported by Güsewell et al., 2017 for Switzerland) than a lack of chilling (e.g. Fu, Zhao, et al., 2015). Nevertheless, there are differences in this decreased sensitivity of warming with leaf unfolding and flowering of fruit trees and wild plant species exhibiting the strongest decline in trend strength.

In autumn, leaf colouring and fall trends now predominantly (57%) indicated delayed onset dates with a mean positive trend. However since 1951–1960 was characterized by earlier mean onset dates, it has to be checked whether a prolongation of the records into the past (1951–1970) might have driven this result. In contrast, farmers’ activities in autumn were still advancing, but to a lesser degree, although the percentage of advancing trends slightly decreased. To conclude, any changes in leaf colouring and fall dates are still not well understood. With ongoing climate warming, more heat and drought extremes, such as in 2003, 2015 and 2018, in conjunction with biotic disturbances might lead to premature leaf senescence interfering with correct observation of autumn phenophases.

There was still a lengthening of the growing season of ~0.26 days/year and this lengthening only marginally decreased in the most recent decade confirming many other studies (e.g. Kolářová, Nekovář, & Adamík, 2014). In this respect our paper disagrees with the findings of Chen et al. (2019), likely because species other than trees were also incorporated in our spring signal. In contrast, the FS was shortened by −0.15 days/year due to a smaller advancing trend in farmers’ spring activities than in the development of wild plant species, matching the previous findings of Estrella et al. (2007). In principle, farmers themselves should profit from this earlier start of the (abiotic) growing season, also by using more cold tolerant cultivars of maize and summer cereals, but according to Parker, Shonkwiler, and Aurbacher (2017) this advance is buffered by still severe minimum temperatures. Equally, crop ripening and harvest (F ) may also be partially triggered by the choice of early versus late‐maturing cultivars (Peltonen‐Sainio & Jauhiainen, 2014), explaining the shortened crop generative period.

The control of phenology by seasonal warming patterns (Lapenis et al., 2014) leads to a variation in the phenological signal over time, with time of the year, site and elevation. Our results, for nearly all phases, match findings of stronger advancing trends at higher elevations (e.g. Ziello, Estrella, Kostova, Koch, & Menzel, 2009) resulting, for example, in a more uniform spring across elevations (Vitasse et al., 2018). Across the seasons the strongest advances in spring phenology were observed for early flowering species and/or very warm sites. Modelling clearly confirmed differential advances: Farmers’ activities in spring and autumn only advanced at half of the rate, whereas ripening phases and especially crop vegetative phases in spring advanced more than the mean rate of ~0.22 days/year. It is important to notice that spring development of winter cereals is (at least) comparable to that of fruit trees and wild species. Nonwoody and insect‐pollinated plant species advanced less than wind‐pollinated species, which was also found in the western Mediterranean (Gordo & Sanz, 2009). Advancing trends reached their maximum rates when starting at ~1978, a finding which corresponds to the reported 1980s regime shift (Reid et al., 2016).

Although the change pattern varied over time, the (still) advancing trends could be attributed to warming. More specifically, based on percentages of significant trends matching the warming, advancing farming activities are likely, ripening phases in summer are very likely and phenological spring phases, such as leaf unfolding and flowering, are very or extremely likely to mirror the increasing temperatures. The spatial approach confirmed this attribution, however, to a lesser degree. Seasonal warming was significantly associated with spring phases’ advance in fruit trees and wild plant species, generative phases in crops as well as farmers’ activities mirroring winter and spring warming (descending order, F not with spring warming). Advancing farmers’ summer activities clearly mirrored summer and autumn warming patterns. The association in autumn was reversed with below average warming in winter and spring being linked to advanced leaf colouring and fall (see equally Estrella & Menzel, 2006; Zohner & Renner, 2019) and less warming in summer being linked to advanced farmers’ autumn activities. Most interestingly, what has been described as carry‐over effects (Sparks, Buras, Estrella, & Menzel, 2020; Zohner & Renner, 2019), is depicted by this attribution analysis, where below average warming in summer was linked to advancing phenological trends in spring (FWv , FWg , F ). Thus, formal attribution of phenological trends does not only shape a formal fingerprint in nature, but additionally fosters a deeper understanding of the drivers.

The results of the updated study are relevant in a number of ways. A stronger advance of early spring wind‐pollinated species leads to an earlier start of the allergenic pollen season. Citizen scientists can still observe climate change in their backyard and these spring advances including a lengthening of the growing season are to a large extent attributable to warming, although our refined analysis on nine clusters showed the superiority of fruit trees and wild species in this respect. A tricky question to be investigated in the future is why summer ripening phases of fruit trees and wild species do not mirror any warming pattern, whereas summer harvesting in agriculture does.

Our results clearly underline that farmers’ decisions (weaker trends and smaller trend changes in spring and autumn) may be driven by other factors as well, although farmers seem to respond/adapt since their activities in spring were the only phase to exhibit stronger advancing trends in Update. A shortening of the crop generative period may have undesired consequences for yield, but will allow more intercropping or earlier sowing of winter cereals.

Results of our comprehensive analysis of the complete plant phenological data set in these three Central European countries underline that the ecological consequences of these changes are challenging to be assessed due to inherent variation of changes over time, season, with topography and plant traits, but this variation does not hamper climate change attribution.",mainstream,M0768f,climate.change
291,"Starting in the Industrial Revolution and continuing today, the burning of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal) increased at a very high rate. Inventions like the steam engine, factory machines, and other mechanical products have largely been powered by fossil fuels over the last couple hundred years. In particular, the uses of vehicles like cars and planes have caused carbon emissions to skyrocket. The clearing of land for agricultural and urban development has also depleted plant life (plants reduce carbon dioxide concentrations) and produced more carbon emissions. The result of these carbon emissions is climate change.

The effects of climate change are numerous and varied, and will drastically change the conditions of human civilization over the next century or so. As glaciers melt from rising temperatures, sea levels across the world are rising, endangering coastal communities. Many animal populations are being affected by climate change, either by the depletion of their natural habitats or sensitivity to the temperature/chemical change in their environments. The change in Earth’s temperature has also created severe weather events (like hurricanes and superstorms) and seasonal shifts that disrupt crop cycles. Extreme heat as an effect of climate change will render currently inhabited regions unlivable for humans.

Despite the inevitability of some effects of climate change, there are many people who are working to ameliorate or combat the damage. Scientists continue to study climate change and possible solutions to its causes. Many also make ongoing efforts to recycle, decrease carbon emissions, and preserve natural habitats. Due to the global nature of climate change, many international communities have begun to work together to change their practices and reduce their carbon emissions. Much will be lost due to climate change, but the future is never certain, and the ongoing actions of some will hopefully have a positive effect on the fates of many.

Climate change is often used interchangeably with global warming but this use is subject to debate. Though global warming used to be the more popular expression among environmental scientists, climate change is now preferred because it encompasses effects beyond the rising temperatures around the globe. Global warming is often dismissed by climate change deniers, who, for instance, erroneously point to cold spells as evidence against the very existence of climate change.",mainstream,M0ade0,climate.change
339,"Were the predictions we made about climate change 20 years ago accurate? Here's a look

When it comes to climate change, did we accurately predict in 2000 what would be happening now?

""What the models correctly told us 20 years ago is that if we continued to add fossil fuels at an increasing rate to the atmosphere, we'd see an increasing range of consequences, including a decline in Arctic sea ice, a rise in sea levels and shifts in precipitation patterns,"" Weather Underground meteorologist Robert Henson told USA TODAY.

Overall, we're running quite close to the projections made in 2000 for carbon dioxide concentration, global temperature and sea level, Henson said.

Here's a look at climate change indicators for 2020:

Carbon dioxide is the greenhouse gas that scientists say is most responsible for global warming.

Since the early 1990s, the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's atmosphere has jumped from about 358 parts per million to nearly 412 ppm, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That’s a 15% rise in 27 years.

More: 10 years to save planet Earth: Here are 6 imaginative climate change solutions

Since 1992, the global sea level has risen on average 2.9 millimeters a year. That’s a total of 78.3 millimeters, according to NOAA.

Penn State University meteorologist Michael Mann argued that we underestimated the rate of ice sheet collapse, which has ""implications for future sea-level rise.""

Both of the world's giant ice sheets have lost tremendous amounts of ice in the past two to three decades: The Greenland ice sheet lost 5.2 trillion tons of ice from 1993 to 2018, according to a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The Antarctic ice sheet lost 3 trillion tons of ice from 1992 to 2017, according to a study in the journal Nature.

20 predictions for 2020: Here's what people thought would happen by this year

Mann told USA TODAY that we ""underestimated the dramatic increase in persistent weather extremes like the unprecedented heat waves, droughts, wildfires and floods we’ve witnessed in recent years.""

Since 1993, there have been 212 weather disasters that cost the United States at least $1 billion each, when adjusted for inflation.

In total, they cost $1.45 trillion and killed more than 10,000 people. That’s an average of 7.8 such disasters per year since 1993, compared with 3.2 per year from 1980 to 1992, according to NOAA.

""Just as climate models almost certainly underestimate the impact climate change has already had on such weather extremes, projections from these models also likely underestimate future increases in these types of events,"" Mann wrote in The Washington Post last year.

“By and large, our models have gotten it right, plus or minus a little bit,” said Zeke Hausfather, a University of California-Berkeley scientist.

Report: Climate change is damaging the health of the world's children and threatens lifelong impact

Henson noted it's clear that global climate models were on the right track 20 years ago: Global temperatures would continue to rise as greenhouse gases continued to accumulate in the atmosphere.

That's been borne out: The global average temperature rose a tad more than a degree Fahrenheit since the mid-'90s, according to NOAA.

""The global temperature projections were just about on the money,"" Mann said.

More on global warming: You just lived through the warmest decade on record – and it's going to get hotter

These climate models weren't designed to predict decade-by-decade variability, Henson said, so we didn't fully anticipate the slowdown in global atmospheric warming in the first decade of this century and the much more rapid increase in the 2010s, both of which were linked to the evolving rate of heat storage in the ocean.

The annual average extent of Arctic sea ice has shrunk from 4.7 million square miles in 1992 to 3.9 million square miles in 2019, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. That’s a 17% decrease.

""Another thing beyond the scope of year-2000 outlooks were some aspects of regional climate change,"" Henson said. ""For example, it's now clear that droughts in California are much more likely to be 'hot' droughts, and this has laid the groundwork for longer, more devastating wildfire seasons.""

The number of acres burned by wildfires in the USA has more than doubled from a five-year average of 3.3 million acres in the 1990s to 7.6 million acres in 2018, the National Interagency Fire Center said.

""We're also appreciating the threat posed by 'sunny day' flooding much more than we did in 2000,"" Henson said. ""Tidal flooding is far more frequent on many parts of the Gulf and Atlantic coast than it was 20 years ago, and NOAA has projected that some locations could see more than 80 flood days a year as soon as the 2040s.""",mainstream,M07ced,climate.change
81,"For at least 3.8 billion years, the Earth has possessed a climate system that continuously maintained a surface environment conducive to life, with liquid water at the surface, interchanging with various amounts of polar ice. The early Earth was warm, perhaps with higher concentrations of greenhouse gases compensating for a solar output smaller than present. Intermittent ice ages began ∼2.5 billion years ago, perhaps associated with oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere and reduction in methane levels; these included more or less worldwide ‘Snowball Earth’ events, with ice extending to low latitudes. From the beginning of the Phanerozoic, the Earth has alternated between ‘icehouse states’ – albeit of lesser severity than the ‘Snowball’ events – and ‘greenhouse states’, such as that of the Mesozoic Era. The Earth is currently in an icehouse state marked by geologically closely spaced fluctuations of climate, largely paced by astronomical variations and amplified by changes in greenhouse gas levels. The present interglacial state of the Holocene is very likely to soon attain levels of climatic warmth not seen for several million years, because of human modification of climate drivers, notably greenhouse gases.",mainstream,M08f97,climate.change

754,"Mass extinctions are very important to how life evolved on Earth. For example, when an asteroid hit the Earth 66 million years ago, the resulting dinosaur extinction led mammals to take their place.

My colleagues and I have published new research on the mass extinction that took place 359 million years ago at the boundary between the Devonian and Carboniferous geological periods. There have been many previous speculations as to the cause of this event, including volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, climate change, sea level changes, wildfires and the rise of the first forests.

But we have shown that the extinctions on land at this time may have been caused by a catastrophic thinning of the ozone layer that let in damaging levels of ultra-violet radiation. Something similar contributed to the mass extinctions at the end of the Permian and Triassic periods, but these events were caused by volcanic eruptions. Our research suggests the Earth has a natural internal process triggered by a warming climate that can destroy the ozone layer, a serious warning for our own period of climate change.

The Late Devonian extinction played a significant role in the development of vertebrate life. It included the loss of the dominant group of armoured freshwater fish. The survivors were the sharks and the rather minor group of bony fish that subsequently spread out to dominate our younger oceans.

The event also shaped our own evolution because it led to the extinction of the first four-legged “tetrapods”. These were “fish” whose fins had evolved to become limbs with between six and eight fingers and toes. The first land-dwelling tetrapods with five fingers and toes – our ancestors – don’t appear in the fossil record until after this extinction.

To find out exactly what caused the Late Devonian extinction, we looked for evidence of what happened in the atmosphere that was captured by fossilised plants from before and after the event. In particular, we looked at the resistant walls of the microscopic remains of pollen and spores, taken from fossils found in East Greenland and released by dissolving the rock samples in acid.

The resistant walls of spores and pollen are there to protect the cell contents from ultra-violet radiation. But there is a brief interval between the creation of a new cell and the formation of its protective wall when it is vulnerable.

The kinds of spores we examined are covered in small spines that are normally identical in length and have perfectly pointed tips. But most of the spines in our samples were malformed in a wild variety of shapes, suggesting the DNA of their cells was damaged by ultra-violet radiation. This suggests that the Earth’s protective ozone shield was down as the spores were formed.

Other spores and pollen had pigmented walls that acted as a protective tan, enabling those plants to survive. But a number of important plant groups quickly became extinct and the forest ecosystem collapsed. Those groups that survived were still disrupted and it took several million years to rebuild, creating quite a different ecosystem in the process.

Our samples came from a very large ancient lake that existed all year round despite being in a very arid part of the world. Such lakes only form when glaciers collapse and the world’s seasonal monsoon is very active due to solar heat, so the global climate must have been in a warming period.

Other scientists have shown that high summer temperatures over continental areas can increase the transport of water vapour high into the atmosphere. This water vapour carries with it organic carbon compounds that include chlorine, which are produced naturally by a wide variety of plants, algae and fungi. Once these compounds are near the ozone layer, they release the chlorine and this breaks down ozone molecules.

This produces a positive feedback loop because a collapsing terrestrial ecosystem will release a flush of nutrients into the oceans, which can cause a rapid increase in algae. So the more the ozone layer is damaged, the more plants die, and the more ozone-damaging compounds are released. Later on, the ozone layer will naturally recover as the climate cools and the algae helps remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

The discovery of this potential new extinction mechanism indicates that a warming climate, such as we have now, has the potential to erode the ozone layer to let in damaging ultra-violet radiation. This has consequences for all life on Earth, both on the land and in shallow waters.

We believe it is as important as recognising that asteroid impacts caused mass extinctions. Once we knew about the consequences of asteroid impacts, there followed an intense collective research effort to assess the threat. We now plot the paths of all large extra-terrestrial objects likely to come close to the Earth’s orbit.

Similarly, we now need to focus effort on understanding the links between global warming and the production and atmospheric transport of chlorine-bearing carbon compounds that have the potential to cause similar destruction of our ozone layer.

We now need to make further studies of the rocks with malformed spores to work out the duration of the extinction and the likely rate of temperature change required to push enough ozone-destroying chemicals high into the atmosphere. We also want to do ultra-violet malformation experiments on living fern-like plants which have spiny spores.",mainstream,M0ef0e,climate.change
566,"Global surface temperature has been measured since 1880 at a network of ground-based and ocean-based sites. Over the last century, the average surface temperature of the Earth has increased by about 1.0o F. The eleven warmest years this century have all occurred since 1980, with 1995 the warmest on record. The higher latitudes have warmed more than the equatorial regions. Beginning in 1979, satellites have been used to measure the temperature of the atmosphere up to a height of 30,000 feet. The long-term surface record and the recent satellite observations differ, but that fact is not surprising: the two techniques measure the temperature of different parts of the Earth system (the surface, and various layers of the atmosphere). In addition to this, a variety of factors, such as the presence of airborne materials from the 1991 eruption of the volcano Mt. Pinatubo, affect each record in a different way. Satellite observations were initially interpreted as showing a slight cooling, but more recent analyses accounting for natural, short-term fluctuations imply warming, just as the ground-based measurements have indicated over a longer time period. As more data from the satellite record become available, and as the quality of measurements is improved, comparison of these two records should yield additional insights. What does warming do? A warmer Earth speeds up the global water cycle: the exchange of water among the oceans, atmosphere, and land. Higher temperatures cause more evaporation, and soils will tend to dry out faster. Increased amounts of water in the atmosphere will mean more rain or snow overall. We may be seeing the first signs of changes in the water cycle. Since the beginning of the century, precipitation in the United States has increased by about 6 percent, while the frequency of intense precipitation events (heavy downpours of more than two inches per day) has increased by 20 percent. Such events can cause flooding, soil erosion, and even loss of life. In some midcontinental areas, increased evaporation has led to drought because the heavy rains fell elsewhere. There is also evidence that ecosystems are reacting to warming. Between 1981 and 1991, the length of the growing season in the northern high latitudes (between 45oand 70o N) increased by a total of up to twelve days, as documented by satellite imagery. Greening in spring and summer occurred up to eight days earlier, and vegetation continued to photosynthesize an estimated four days longer. Global mean sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches over the last 100 years, mainly because water expands when heated. The melting of glaciers, which has occurred worldwide over the last century, also contributes to the rise. Formerly frozen soils (permafrost) in the Alaskan and Siberian arctic have also begun to melt, damaging both ecosystems and infrastructure. Melting and tundra warming will also lead to decay of organic matter and the release of trapped carbon and methane, creating an additional source of greenhouse gases.",mainstream,M0ae2e,climate.change; global.warming
240,"This article appeared on The Millennium Report on April 14, 2016 entitled The Final Steps Towards Armageddon Thanks to MLordandGod for a reading of this article.

There are two factions of evil fighting for the soul of humanity. Both are old and shrouded in secrecy. Both have complex networks of intelligence that have agents in every major bank and political action group in the world. Both encircle the globe and have centuries of fraud, corruption and murder on their hands. It is fair to say that if you are reading this, from any place on the Earth, you are deeply affected by the evil machinations of these two rival forces. Surprisingly enough, they work so closely together that you might not notice the battle raging right before your eyes.

Many conspiracy theorists point in the direction of these two groups that are led by a “man in black” and a “man in white.” Before Christmas 2016, the final steps toward Armageddon will be made by both of these groups and the fate of humanity depends on making sure that neither group is able to carry out their plan of hegemony – world dominion under two rulers who govern the religious (cultural), judicial (legal), and economic (military) aspects of the globe. The New World Order, One World Order, or the Transnational Globalist Republic is only a few steps away. The traces of those plans lead to Jerusalem and the bid for power over the land where Armageddon is predicted to take place.

“While the world starves, burns, and descends further into chaos, we should realize that this year’s Christmas celebrations for those who choose to celebrate it may be their last. Francis I

“We are close to Christmas. There will be lights, there will be parties, bright trees, even Nativity scenes – all decked out – while the world continues to wage war. It’s all a charade. The world has not understood the way of peace. The whole world is at war. Even today, after the second failure of another world war, perhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal, with crimes, massacres, destruction.” Francis I

During the filming of the annual Christmas Message for the BBC, December 26, 2015, the Queen said,

There are Two Popes

“I have the authority of the King of kings. I am all in all and above all, so that God, Himself and I, The Vicar of God, have but one consistory, and I am able to do almost all that God can do. What therefore, can you make of me but God.” Pope Boniface VIII, The Bull Sanctum, 11/18/1302.

Not many people understand that there are two popes: one that we see on official occasions at the Vatican, dressed in his white ceremonial robes surrounded by his cadre of cardinals, priests, and clergy. This office is currently held by Francis 1. The black pope, who is rarely seen, is the General Superior of the Society of Jesus, aka, the Jesuits. This office is currently held by Adolfo Nicolas who lives in the Vatican in the Jesuit headquarters. This position was held originally by the Jesuit founder Ignatius of Loyola.

Generally speaking, the White Pope has always been about centralized power in Rome around a central hierarchy, canon law, and a central bank. The Jesuits, on the other hand, have always been about the ideas of liberation theology, decentralized power through the Black Pope and his tentacles throughout the world – ostensibly the best intelligence network ever in operation, along with the schools that provide the indoctrination into Jesuit socialism and theocratic communism.

The White Pope in Rome working through bankers, whether the original central banks of Venice, Genoa, and Florence, or the Jewish court bankers like the Rothschild family, manipulate political allegiances that lead to continuous war. Banks were created in Italian to fund these wars, especially the crusades. As we have explained in our article on the Military-Industrial Complex, war was lucrative business for the church and the bankers. Christians went off to the Holy Land to defend the “land that Jesus walked upon” and keep the roads open to pilgrims coming to the sacred sites of Palestine, especially Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

When this church was torn down by Muslims, it became the spark that ignited crusade after crusade where millions lost their lives as the wealth of Europe was grabbed by the Catholic Church through the Templars and Italian bankers. Many pilgrims started in Venice where the city provided ships, arms, goods, and a place to hold the pilgrim’s wealth against the attacks of the Muslims on the road to Jerusalem. The Templars had castles and fortresses along the way and banks where you could do business to redeem your wealth on the roads to the Holy Land.

In Europe, the Pope received the lands and wealth of the nobles going off to crusades. The Vatican funded and manipulated the wealth of the nobility to its own aims. The Knights Hospitaller, the Templars, and many other military and pseudo-military orders arose to channel the nobility into war for the Vatican.

The Vatican wants Jerusalem. This battle has never ceased.

The battle still rages today and many are used in the play of Biblical narratives that use Jerusalem as the focal point. The Vatican lusts for Jerusalem, the Jesuits worship Jerusalem and of Christ and the Queen of England owns large parts of Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount. All three faiths of “the book” want Jerusalem, the Jews and the Palestinians both want Jerusalem, and the location of the War of Armageddon is near Jerusalem.

Because of the critical role Jerusalem plays, we it is set to become the home of a “one world government” that combines religious, judicial, and economic branches into a “global corporation” that unites all nations.

We can see that the scenario is prepared for the War of Armageddon. In Syria, Gog and Magog, Russia and China are amassing on the borders of “Greater Israel.” This is unprecedented and seen as the fulfillment of the prophecies of the Book of Revelations. Many nations are battling for Jerusalem as Iran, Iraq and many other Muslim nations conspire to destroy Israel.

The Muslims believe their Messiah is near and that is why Syria is being destroyed.

The Jews await their messiah anxiously to help them build the third temple.

Christians anxiously await the return of Christ in Jerusalem.

The Jesuits literally believe the Book of Revelation and they say the time is now to bring the physically reincarnated Jesus Christ to Jerusalem as the King of Jerusalem. Along these lines they have already “anointed” Juan Carlos as the King of Jerusalem (thus also his heir Felipe VI).

The CEO of the Catholic Church, the White Pope

The White Pope is the CEO of the Catholic Church and has always used “other banks” to provide interest on money because the church at one time condemned (now just disapproves) usury. The Knights of Malta are one remnant of an age old system of banking and wealth controlled through the White Pope and the Vatican Bank. When we see pictures of White Pope Francis with the Knights of Malta, we can no longer be naïve that they are a charity organization that just happens to dress up in military outfits, complete with swords. The White Pope and the Knights of Malta are completely corrupt, all the while parading as a charity.

There is another group that is within and above the Knights of Malta called the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem who are sworn to defend the White Pope even above the famous French Guard. Now we are at the very apex of the pyramid structure. King Juan Carlos I of Spain and his heir Felipe VI are protectors of the Jesuits and they (Carlos or his son) are head of the Equestrian Order. Keep in mind that the Jesuits and the Knights of Malta have fought over the island of Malta for centuries. Two factions. One island. But not just any island, one that represents control of the entire world order.

Juan Carlos is a Jesuit through and through as the head of the Order of Calatrava. His Merovingian blood lineage names him as “holy blood” from the fabled “wondrous child” that was born to Mary Magdalene and carried to France with Mary (the Mother of Jesus) and the other Mary (her sister). If legend is true, Juan Carlos I and Felipe VI are heirs of Jesus of Nazareth and hold the title of King of Jerusalem. The King of Spain is also head of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and Juan Carlos is the President of the Organization of Ibero-American States. The Ibero-American Union, which includes the European Union, of which the United Kingdom is a member, includes 700 million people in Europe, the Mediterranean and South American.

: Carlos and Felipe’s cousins Prince Phillip, Prince Charles and his son William, who is to be crowned King of England this summer, hold the same claim to being the King of Jerusalem.

The Windsors claim to be the true Monarchs of Europe (European Union) and Jerusalem through Merovingian blood lines with the protection of the Knights of Malta and the Vatican through the White Pope. Yet the Juan Carlos line claims the same title as King of Jerusalem through the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre.

The Windsors work with the White Pope Francis I through the Knights of Malta. So who does Juan Carlos works through?

There is also a new twist to this age old battle for power in that White Pope Francis I is a Jesuit.

: This is the first time in history that the Pope was also a Jesuit.

“The Jesuits have a vow to obey the pope, but if the pope is a Jesuit, maybe he should have a vow to obey the superior general of the Jesuits… I feel like I’m still a Jesuit in terms of my spirituality, what I have in my heart.” Francis I

Thus, it appears the Jesuits have won the centuries’ old battle between the Jesuits (and the Black Pope) and the Knights of Malta (and the White Pope). In Pope Francis we have both. Almost.

But Adolfo Nicolas is still the Black Pope and head of the Society of Jesus. Unless……something happens like:

Fr. General Nicolás Will Convoke GC 36 and Intends to Retire

The Jesuit Black Pope is scheduled to “step down” sometime in 2016. This will open the stage for one of the last steps of the plan to Armageddon.

What Happens When the White Pope Becomes the Black Pope?

It would only seem logical for the Vatican to announce sometime soon that they will unify the two pope positions and create the first all-in-one pope that combines both streams. This is another reason why Pope Benedict XVI had to retire! The plan was set in motion long ago. Popes serve until they die. Benedict and Nicolas will be some of the only popes in history—either white or black—who left their office before death.

: CHECK MATE. The centuries’ long battle in the Catholic Church between White and Black will soon be over and the Jesuits are positioned for world domination.

What we should all be watching for is the next step: The White Pope Francis I will be elected the new Jesuit Black Pope. The White and Black Popes will combine for the first time in history. We might say that there will be a “Grey Pope” who will combine the work of the White and the Black Popes into one job, one agenda, one world plan to try and fulfill the apocalyptic predictions of the War of Armageddon and the return of Jesus in a physical body to conquer Jerusalem and rule the world. The new Gray Pope will move to Jerusalem to lead a World Council of Churches that governs the “free” realm of religious belief and practice and its implications in the social sphere.

He can already hear in the White Pope’s words what he has planned and is preaching openly:

“Jesus Christ, Jehovah, Allah. These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the world. For centuries, blood has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths. This, however, should be the very concept which unites us as people, as nations, and as a world bound by faith. Together, we can bring about an unprecedented age of peace, all we need to achieve such a state is respect each other’s beliefs, for we are all children of God regardless of the name we choose to address him by. We can accomplish miraculous things in the world by merging our faiths, and the time for such a movement is now.” Francis I

The White Pope wants to merge all religions and kill the Catholic Church as we know Her. He is transitioning to a World Church where all beliefs are equal and the same. All religions will be merged into a grey religious new world order headed by the new Gray Pope. Francis will be the head of this church and Jerusalem will be its new home.

The Last Christmas Was Announced

That is why Francis and others have spoken said publicly that Christmas 2015 was the last Christmas.

“While the world starves, burns, and descends further into chaos, we should realize that this year’s Christmas celebrations for those who choose to celebrate it may be their last.” Francis I

VIDEO: Pope Says This is the Last Christmas.

As we hear the uncertainty in his words, “may be their last”, we can only wonder what he means. Perhaps there will be no Christmas because there will be no Christianity, per se. Perhaps a One World Religion will become the only accepted practice and all others are mere earlier stages of this new amalgamated religion. Francis seems quite dramatic about the “end of days” that he speaks about so often. He even believes that a World War III has already begun and that he is the Social Judge of all that is right and good for the entire globe, no matter what religion, country, or race.

But didn’t the Queen of England also say that 2015 would be the final Christmas, too?

VIDEO: Queen says 2015 Will Be Final Christmas.

The Redistribution Agenda of the Gray Pope?

The Gray Pope will be a common Pope of all people who rules the world through his social and environmental programs that raise the poor up out of the sin of poverty. What Francis doesn’t mention is who is going to pay for this. He rails against poverty as the springboard for world-wide social reform, led by his holiness.

“Inequality is the root of social evil.” Francis I

“A contribution to this equitable development will also be made both by international activity aimed at the integral human development of all the world’s peoples and by the legitimate redistribution of economic benefits by the State, as well as indispensable cooperation between the private sector and civil society.” Francis I

We have heard Francis I call for redistribution of the wealth to raise the poor to an “equal” status with the now wealthy. This type of rhetoric is beautiful but impractical if not impossible to manifest. This “Theocratic Socialism” is another name for the Liberation Theology of the Jesuits. It is a type of “socialist communism” ran by the church, or more specifically, the Jesuits in the church.

When the White Pope Francis I becomes the Black Pope, the Jesuits have won the battle. Theocratic Socialism, instead of democratic monarchies will rule. One Pope, one religion, one world order of Jesuit inspired socialism will govern from the Holy Land and redistribute the remaining wealth of the world (aka, any wealth the Jesuits don’t control already). The old wealth of monarchies and insider intelligence groups like the Knights of Malta, the Pilgrim Society, the Bilderbergs, Trilateralists, Warlord Bankers and offshore tax havens will all collapse as the new regime of theocratic socialism run by Transnational globalists dissolve the economic wealth of the criminal activities of mafias, royalty, and rich that has accumulated over hundreds of years. The old wealth of the Catholic Church itself will be dissolved as the new center of the religious world becomes Jerusalem.

It is very likely that the Gray Pope will rule from the Temple Mount in a temple that will fulfill the prophecies of a third Jewish temple. But there will have to be strong international legal (courts) and economic (military) components of this plan for world hegemony and Francis I has already named the organization that will carry out his social plans. In his recent visit to the United Nations earlier this year (2016) he said:

“Consequently, while encouraging you [the United Nations] in your continuing efforts to coordinate the activity of the international agencies, which represents a service to all humanity, I urge you to work together in promoting a true, worldwide ethical mobilization which, beyond all differences of religious or political convictions, will spread and put into practice a shared ideal of fraternity and solidarity, especially with regard to the poorest and those most excluded.” Francis I

This type of “fraternity and solidarity” between the rich and the poor has been the cause of countless wars. There will be no leveling of wealth without dramatic political, economic, and military intervention. The rich will not join the One World Religion if it means loosing wealth. This battle has been waged for some time and is now at a fever’s pitch.

“The world has not understood the way of peace. The whole world is at war. Even today, after the second failure of another world war, perhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal, with crimes, massacres, destruction.” Francis I

Pope Francis is in a war, a battle between white and black – charity and dominion. He believes that by taking away all of the guns and weapons in the world, he could demand peace between all nations. Steps like the United Nations Small Arms Treaty are along the lines that Francis recommends. Take away the weapons, make all religions the same, and institute One World Government. And as we have seen, the United Nations is the chosen vehicle that Francis will use to enact his final play—the disarmament of the United States citizenry.

Most people will agree that the United Nations is already well on the way to creating the substructure that will be necessary to create the New World Order – as it was named by George H. W. Bush in his inaugural address. Every president since Bush has also blindly supported the agencies and programs of the United Nations. As this website has accurately pointed out:

Will Juan Carlos (or Felipe) be Crowned King of the World?

One of the final steps towards Armageddon will be the election of Juan Carlos (or Felipe VI) as the president of the United Nations which will maintain the international agencies already housed in Geneva, the Swiss Canton that is ruled by Juan Carlos and Felipe through the House of Savoy. The original League of Nations building will become the new home of the United Nations General Assembly.

As depicted in the Apocalypse of St. John, ten kings will serve the one king who sits on the ancient throne. This will usher in a new world direction of international cooperation that will hopefully stem the tide of Armageddon. Francis will work through Juan Carlos (Felipe VI) as the King of Jerusalem, the President of the United Nations, and the Jesuit anointed head of the Equestrian Order that has sown allegiance to protect and defend the Pope.

It has not been a self-evident conclusion that Juan Carlos (Felipe VI) would be the best person for the job of president of the United Nations. Our intel indicates that Prince Charles (or the rumored coronation of Prince William that keeps popping up from time to time) have been battling behind the scenes for the job, but have lost the battle, hence no need to crown the Queen’s successor. The peculiar behavior of Prince Charles makes more sense when you know he was (is) trying to appear as a good candidate for the position. Rumors have it that both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama covet the position. We imagine that if the Queen were not so advanced in years, she, too, would assume the position should be hers. For if a Windsor could gain international power, the wealth of the monarchies and the Knights of Malta might remain secure and hidden.

Juan Carlos and Felipe are excellent candidates for the position and with the help of the Jesuits and the Knights of Malta, they are assured victory especially in light of the dark side of the Windsor family that is coming into public light. Hardly anyone believes that the Queen is what she says she is. Elizabeth is more than likely the richest person on Earth if her entire offshore holdings were counted. Many say the Windsors have done little to help others and the conspiracy theorists rave on about the fraud, corruption, and evil of the English Crown. The death of Princess Diana and Prince Charles’s affair strikes Charles, and thus his whole family, from the short list of candidates for President of the UN.

Charles is continuously saying callous things that show he has little compassion or any understanding of the real world. Here are a few quotes from Prince Charles that will not win him approval from the Pope:

“It [Christianity] has no right to challenge Islam or any other religion. It is merely a Western face of God.”

“Do you seriously expect me to be the first Prince of Wales in history not to have a mistress?

“Islam can teach us today a way of understanding and living in the world which Christianity itself is poorer for having lost.”

“There’s nothing like a jolly good disaster to get people to start doing something.”

“Extremism is no more the monopoly of Islam than it is the monopoly of other religions, including Christianity.”

Thus, it seems evident that either Juan Carlos or Felipe will be the chosen one to lead the United Nations in its battle to bring the Gray Pope’s Jesuit socialism to the world. And we are warned by the Jesuits that if we don’t follow along this path, Armageddon is sure to happen. Gog and Magog gather around Jerusalem and the stage has been set. The threat of world annihilation will help engender support for this Jesuit plan of world hegemony that plays off of the images of Revelations. These battle plans have been in the works for the past 120 years and only a few final steps need to be made.

: Gray Pope = Pope of the World. King of Spain = King of the World.

Finally, the Anglo-Spanish War (Protestants vs Catholics) is over. The Jesuits win.

The United Nations has worked tirelessly since its inception as the League of Nations to roll out the carpet for a one world government. It should have been call “the death of nations” instead of the league. Every agency, program or fund works to undermine nations not build them up. Until now, the United Nations has been under the control of the Transnational Warlord Bankers who created it.

There is a strong push now for socialism (leading to theocratic socialism) and the One World Order. All of the agencies, programs, funds and aspects of the United Nations focuses on the redistribution of wealth. It is essentially a congress of corporations who all are independent, but use the United Nations as a banner to fly underneath. There has been little power vested in the organization which has been demonstrated by the lackluster success of its efforts. But once the United Nations has been empowered, there will be no end to the effectiveness of the socialist programs already created and waiting to be empowered.

We have examined transnationalist programs in previous articles, but it doesn’t hurt to put the UN under a microscope. Scan below to see some of the organizations, corporations, programs and funds of the United Nations that wish to govern and control the entire globe as one international union with ten regions.

Specialized Agencies are legally independent international organizations with their own rules, membership, organs and financial resources, were brought into relationship with the United Nations through negotiated agreements. Given the diversity of their respective fields of action, history and experience, each agency has its own needs and concerns, not to speak of corporate culture.

Under the guise of ecology and sustainability, the United Nations has developed overall goals for all nations. These goals seems optimistic and positive until you ask how these things could happen. In order to accomplish any of these goals, the United Nations would first have to bring all of these aspects “under control” before they could be assessed and managed. Therefore, it is an assumption that world control of all of the most important issues for life on earth will become the domains of the leaders of the United Nations. Essentially, the socialistic goals of the programs of the United Nations will be first turned into a communistic dictatorship to bring all aspects of life under the control of the President of the United Nations and the Gray Pope. Even the court systems that mete out justice will be UN agencies.

The Rothschild Family will continue to be the controlling bankers of the world through the United Nations World Bank. The Rothschilds have historically been the Queen’s bankers, but they are really aligned with Carlos and the Jesuits. Anybody here want to let the Queen know “game over”?

Here are some the programs that the United Nations has adopted as goals for the future. If you read closely, the altruism quickly turns to world domination.
• End poverty in all its forms everywhere (translation: control all wealth)
• End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture (control all food sources)
• Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (control all medicine and health care)
• Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all (educational brainwashing)
• Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls (control all females)
• Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all (control all resources)
• Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all (control all energy)

• l all economies)Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation (control all industry)
• Reduce inequality within and among countries (control all nations)
• Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable (control all wars)
• Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts (control all development)
• Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development (control all water)
• Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss (control all natural resources)
• Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels (control all courts)
• Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development (control all laws)

Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development

This Agenda is an acclaimed plan of action for people, the planet, and prosperity. It also claims to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom. The 2030 Agenda asserts that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. All countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnership, will implement this plan so they say. But keep in mind the very reason the world has such extreme poverty is that the elite, and mega-rich, monarchs, and Vatican have STOLEN THE WORLD’S WEALTH FROM HER PEOPLE. The 1% (soon to be the .001%) have taken everything that the 99% have worked, toiled, invested, and saved from the first time that a traveler on the road to the crusades handed his wealth to a Templar or Hospitaller for safe keeping, only to have it confiscated at his death, until today where illicit governments around the world continue to rob its citizenry with higher taxes and loss of freedoms.

But they don’t think we have caught on to this and their Agenda 2030 continues to read:

We are resolved to free the human race from the tyranny of poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet. We are determined to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. We must balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental. (translation: redistribution of wealth, universal Marshall law, control science)

People – We are determined to end poverty and hunger, in all their forms and dimensions, and to ensure that all human beings can fulfil their potential in dignity and equality and in a healthy environment.

Planet – We are determined to protect the planet from degradation, including through sustainable consumption and production, sustainably managing its natural resources and taking urgent action on climate change, so that it can support the needs of the present and future generations.

Prosperity – We are determined to ensure that all human beings can enjoy prosperous and fulfilling lives and that economic, social and technological progress occurs in harmony with nature.

Peace – We are determined to foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies which are free from fear and violence. There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development.

Partnership – We are determined to mobilize the means required to implement this Agenda through a revitalized Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, based on a spirit of strengthened global solidarity, focused in particular on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable and with the participation of all countries, all stakeholders and all people.

These programs of the United Nations are the best tools to institute Socialistic Communism or Theocratic Socialism that any dictator would want and they fly under the international banner of charity, love, and the destruction of poverty. Who doesn’t want to support such lofty ideals? But the devil is in the detail, and the devil doesn’t want us looking at those details.

We are awake. And we will banish the United Nations from U.S. soil and refuse to fund its evil operations as it is an enemy within our own country. We will indict and prosecute the many traitors in our government and defund and shut down the pseudo-government agencies who are working to destroy our country. American patriots will NEVER give up their Second Amendment Rights to the United Nations and we refuse to be a military branch of the UN.

We will reinstate the U.S. Constitution, including the very important 13th Amendment, and fill FEMA internment camps with traitors of our country, no matter how esteemed they make us believe they are.

The good news is that the time for Armageddon is not now. The Jesuits use fear driven apocalyptic narratives to press the issue of the second coming of Christ as a world leader who victoriously rides a white horse into Jerusalem to expel the Jews and Muslims from the Holy Land. Jesuits are warriors and soldiers who don’t hesitate to do whatever it takes to forward the aims of the Society of Jesus and the Black Pope. But when the White Pope also becomes the Black Pope – total Jesuit dominion of the Catholic Church is complete and the stage is set for the Jesuit bid for world domination through the King of Jerusalem, the Pope of Jerusalem and their governing body of the United Nations.

The battle is now and the time is at hand to recognize the signs of the time and not be duped into believing another globalist narrative that peace will come when all wealth is gathered and redistributed and all religions are melted down into the least common denominator. The Catholic Church has always chosen the side of the strong, whether fascist, Jesuit, warlord banker, or Knight of any one of dozens of orders. Perhaps it is time that the Vatican be challenged on its infallibility and moral foundation that puts its own interests above those of others.

A world entirely covered in ice, from pole to pole—the so-called snowball earth—is something we find it hard to get our heads around, even though the longest and oldest period of total or near-total glaciation, the Huronian glaciation, lasted for three hundred million years. A world without ice is also hard to visualize, though it is by comparison a much more recent phenomenon: perhaps only thirty-four million years ago, crocodiles swam in a freshwater lake we know as the North Pole, and palm trees grew in Antarctica.

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Russian Subscribers

In my report I had detailed how an ever increasing number of continuing energy surges have begun hitting our planet, and to the disruption of our world’s weather cycles.

Conjointly with the disruptions of the world’s weather systems has been the unexplained lighting up of the winter night skies in the far Northern Arctic regions, and as summarized in an article that said in part, ""The entire horizon is raised like magic, like the hand of God is bringing it up.”

More ominous for the world’s human beings perhaps, is that what has been generally relegated to the earth’s Southern Hemispheric regions is now occurring in the Northern ones too.

The evidence for these increasing energy ‘blasts’ are increasingly being pointed towards a number of events that have occurred in the universe in years past, and to which we are now feeling their effects.

One of these events was the Supernova Blast (SN1987a) that occurred on , and as explained by Peter Garnavich of the University of Notre Dame, ""The real fireworks show is finally starting, and over the next 10 years things will get spectacular.” But, and as also contained in this information, the time line for the earth’s visibility of this event lies between the years of 1995-2015. Current events are suggesting however that these events are going to be occurring much sooner than 2010.

The fear evident in Western scientists regarding this event belongs to their theories about Supernovas, and that state that they are one of the most energetic explosive events known. “They occur at the end of a star's lifetime, when its nuclear fuel is exhausted and it is no longer supported by the release of nuclear energy. If the star is particularly massive, then its core will collapse and in so doing will release a huge amount of energy.”

In a particularly strange event surrounding SN1987a, American scientists ‘reworked’ existing theories about supernovas to show not what is necessarily true, but rather what they seemingly wanted to see. (Or more ominously to keep this knowledge hidden from others.) This ‘reworking’ though, still revealed the nervousness about this event by the American scientists, and as evidenced in the comment by Dr. Neil Gehrels of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center when he stated, ""The possibility for mass extinction is indeed real, yet the risk seems much lower than we have thought.""

This American reworking of these formulas to obtain the results they desired left out the continued ozone layer depletion over the Southern Hemispheric Pole, and which according to the currently ongoing 2004 British survey states, “The ozone layer over much of the Southern Hemisphere south of 50° remains around 10% below the long term normal.”

Where in past times ozone layer depletion was rightly ascribed to cosmic rays (gamma rays), Western scientists have with their reworked mathematics created a whole new methodology that blames these depletions on CFC’s (chlorofluorocarbons), and which even first term Russian school child would laugh about if this were not so serious an event.

Best stated about these events from a Western perspective though are these words from an unknown person, “Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not in favor of ANY strange laboratory-created substances polluting the air I have to breathe, and I wholeheartedly endorse the current campaign to rid the atmosphere of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the atoms being blamed for the so-called ""holes"" in the ozone layer. But just stop for a minute and think: If CFCs caused the so-called ""holes,"" why are they ONLY over the ? Are the polar explorers and scientists using too much spray-on deodorant and fly-killer?

Of course not. If CFCs had much to do at all with the so-called ""holes,"" then the ""holes"" would be over , or , or , or at least somewhere relative to these places where it could be shown that the air currents were causing the CFCs to accumulate. But they are not. The ""holes"" only occur in two places, over the North and , exactly in accordance with natural forces which create the bulk of ozone, and exactly in accordance with the theories and predictions of the scientists who discovered them in the first place.

Western science has a long history of contradicting itself, and this time is no exception, and as stated in this research paper contributed to by a number of American educational institutions shows, ""Long-term effects of gamma ray bursts would spread around the Earth and include ozone layer depletion, global cooling, acid rain and radionuclide production.""

So today as the world is awash in acid rain, the ozone layers at the Northern and Southern Hemispheric Poles are expanding, the Western scientists put before their ever growing uneducated citizens a scientific explanation that blames these events on CFCs and fossil fuels, when they know the science behind these assertions is totally false.

An independent American researcher, Ricardo L. Carezani, in his article titled, “SN 1987 A and the Neutrino” says it best in describing Western scientists’ penchant for making facts fit their absurd assertions; “Putting together all 7 facts, the *overwhelming* neutrino evidence is replaced by an overwhelming evidence of ""the pharaoh's science"" (i.e. nothing). For those of you not familiar with the pharaoh's science, you can perform it yourself with a table and ruler: measure an arbitrary number of table parts, use an arbitrary equation, and come up with PI. Anyone can do it! Really!!”

Coming literally on the heels of this Supernova event was the most astronomically significant event of human history with the most powerful explosion in the universe since the Big Bang that occurred in December, 1997. “Astronomers are mystified by the most powerful explosion ever witnessed, an enormous burst of gamma ray energy 12 billion light years from Earth that in one second released almost as much energy as all the stars of the universe.”; and as stated in this article by the American news source CNN.

NASA Headquarters at the Goddard Space Flight Center further added about this event: “A recently detected cosmic gamma ray burst released a hundred times more energy than previously theorized, making it the most powerful explosion since the creation of the universe in the Big Bang.” For about one or two seconds, this burst was as luminous as all the rest of the entire universe,"" said Caltech professor George Djorgovski, one of the two principal investigators on the team from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.

Aside from the majority of Western peoples being ignorant of these events, Western scientists, at least publicly, are still not acknowledging the significance of them for all of the world’s peoples. Even with hundreds of thousands lying dead in there can be no expectation that Western peoples will either become knowledgeable about or heed these many universal warnings.

As incredible as it may seem to us Russians, Western people, (and especially the Americans) these Social Darwinist thinking human beings, fail to even see the connection between the last American space shuttle disaster, the present lighting of the Arctic Regions of the Northern Hemisphere and continuing global weather chaos! They even have State ordered training of their children through their educational systems that indoctrinate them into this way of being! The parents and grandparents of these children even willingly hand over their children to these mass indoctrination centers, and with their knowing the destructiveness of these institutions from the very examples our own Russian history has shown them.

The Western media did report that, “Upper atmosphere may hold clues in mystery” in an article that appeared in an American national publication, USA Today. This article states in part, “The space shuttle Columbia's troubles began as it dropped like a meteor from orbit into a mysterious and poorly understood atmospheric region that scientists have dubbed the ""ignorosphere”. The Concorde, the supersonic jet, flies in the bottom of this region at more than 11 miles above the Earth's surface.

Nothing but a rocket can fly at its upper limit of 53 miles. The ""ignorosphere"" encompasses the mesosphere and upper stratosphere. Invisible clouds, strange electrical flashes called red sprites and blue lightning bolts that strike upward from the tops of clouds inhabit the thin air. This is the place where falling stars are made. The ""ignorosphere"" earns its nickname from the fact that you can't get there from here without a rocket. It is too high for weather balloons and too low for satellites to dip down to gather information.

The connection to these seemingly disconnected events is the rare earth phenomena called Noctilucent Clouds.

What are Noctilucent Clouds? “NLC were first discovered in the summer of 1884 after the eruption of Krakatoa which occurred in 1883. The volcanic eruption was at first thought to have contributed to the formation of NLC due to the ejection of huge quantities of dust into the upper atmosphere; however it has been proven that the eruption was not responsible for their formation.”

The actual ""discoverer"" is debated, however recent work has shown that the first conclusive observations were performed by T.W. Backhouse from Sunderland, U.K. Gadsden and Schroder (1989) question why Noctilucent Clouds were not discovered prior to 1885 and suggest that the eruption of Krakatoa was significant in that it caused observers to take more of a careful note of the twilight skies. This is a very difficult hypothesis to comprehend as it suggests that no observers ever bothered to take note of the twilight sky. This is a highly unlikely scenario as it is would seem very improbable that astronomers and meteorologists who frequently observed would miss such a highly conspicuous phenomena.

Of such concern are these phenomenal Noctilucent Clouds that a number of Western scientific studies are underway in the search for the answers as to why they are increasing, and to the extent that light from them is being reflected back into the normally darkened winter skies. “Increased sightings of noctilucent clouds may be related to climate change.” states one of these research studies underway by an organization named CAWSES (Climate and Weather of the Sun-Earth System), and as stated in their report titled: A proposed new SCOSTEP Program for 2004-2008.

Another study being conducted is by the HAIL Project (Holographic Array for Ionospheric Lightning), associated with the American Stanford University, where their approach is being directed towards, “Direct electrodynamic coupling between lightning discharges and the mesosphere/lower ionosphere evidenced by spectacular luminous optical emissions known as red sprites and elves, VLF signatures of rapid conductivity changes and radar detection of transient ionization patches above a thunderstorms.”

Specifically, these increasing cosmic ray bursts hitting our planet are causing, among other things, an ever increasing amount of upper atmosphere lighting occurrences that are also disturbing our earth’s magnetic field and causing such bad things to happen as small planes falling out of the sky due to disruptions in our magnetic field.

These are best known to aircraft pilots as gravity, or buoyancy waves. “Gravity, or buoyancy waves, are pressure waves generated by disturbances within the atmosphere, where the restoring forces (potential energy) for the wave motion is provided by buoyancy and gravity, rather than compression/expansion as in higher frequency acoustic waves.”

Coinciding with all of these events have been the Americans associating them with their older people’s knowledge (to them myths and legends) and warnings of not only these events, but the future events to come.

Such an example is the association of the 1987 Supernova (SN1987a) with a deliberately planted falsehood of it being the ‘Blue Star’ much talked about in the Hopi American Indian legend. The problem is that the much reported on Hopi ‘Blue Star’, and its significance, is a lie. This is able to be so because the ‘power’ involved with Social Darwinism is that it subverts in the human being their ability to find truths within themselves and surrenders it to the mass propaganda of the State. Like the National Socialistic System (Nazi) of during the Great Patriotic War (World War II) the individuals not in step with the masses are cast outside their social folds.

For this particular example we can see that the beginnings of these rumors that the Hopi peoples had in their older people’s stories a Blue Star began not with the Hopi peoples but with two Western people, Thomas E. Mails, in his book titled “The Hopi Survival Kit” and Moira Timms with her book titled “Beyond Prophecies and Predictions”.

""I am nobody. I am not a shaman, a medicine man, a guru, a channeler, or a psychic. I am not an ex-intelligence officer from the CIA, the NSA, the secret services or any other branch of any service. I am not the reincarnation of an ancient being, an ancient deity or a heavenly visitor. I have nothing to offer you in the way of credibility. I am a nobody... and I like it that way.""

 

 ---Robert Morning Sky, introducing himself in an article called, ""The Blue Star Hoax"" that appeared in LEADING EDGE #95. Among other things, Morning Sky, a Hopi, claimed that the fabled ""Blue Star"" does not exist in Hopi legends, teachings or mythology. It was a term that he invented in the early 1970's that has since been pirated by researchers who falsely claimed to have spent time with Hopi Elders learning the secrets of the Blue Star Kachina (a kachina that Morning Sky says doesn't exist), and channelers, psychics and clairvoyants who claim to have received Blue Star revelations from their spiritual sources.

As we know in about the older people of the earth, it is also possible that their trickster nature has been at play here when it comes to their interactions with the Western peoples of the world. Such exactly are the people of the Kachina Cult, and who the Western people call the Hopi. The Western people’s ‘everything’ is separate, nothing is ‘connected’ world view contributes to their beliefs that ‘their’ older peoples are disassociated with the other older peoples of the world, and therefore gives them no understanding that all of the earths older peoples are the same in thought and spirit about all things.

The mythical lies and State organized propaganda facing the Western people’s however keep them locked away from the incredible mysteries surround these events I’ve presented here before you today.

In my last letter to my American subscribers, and to which I’ve also shared with all of you, titled “Now Visible Comet Heralds Warning of Doom to World” I wrote about the significance of this new ‘Green Comet’ and it’s historical meaning to us living in these years of great tribulation and coming cataclysms, if only we listen to the earths older peoples and the universe itself and learn their songs.

In the ‘choices of the threes’ that human beings are always presented with, we have been shown from these past weeks events that the earths older peoples still know the songs and did not perish in this latest cataclysm: “Elders' Sea Knowledge Spares Some Thais”. We also have the examples of the earth’s animals knowing these songs too: ‘Tsunami Adds to Belief in Animals' 'Sixth Sense' And we also have from another of the earth’s older peoples, that our dreams hold these songs too, if we but listen to them: “His wife dreamed of floods, he built on stilts, and they survived Tsunami”.

The ancient examples of the warnings of ‘oneness’ show to us all also that there is no insignificant event that for the greater warning of all human beings will be made known to all, and these are three.

For many years now the Universe has been singing its song of warning to all human beings.

From the Southern Hemispheric Regions, and where one looks into the great Magellanic Cloud, the older peoples of they call the Aborigines “Slept and dreamt under the stars. They took the night stars for granted. They embraced the darkness. It is woven into their culture through song, dance, ritual, art and myth.”

The Greater Clouds of Magellan is a nebula located about 200,000 light years away and can be viewed with the naked eye. It appears to be like a slightly blurred cloud. In addition, the Tarantula Nebula, said to be the most beautiful sight in the skies (it resembles a spider), runs over the Greater Clouds of Magellan, so it is a constellation with plenty of sights.” It is written here.

It also carries the name of The Swordfish, and which I had previously written to you about. In a book titled “Our Rock Who Art In Heaven, Hallowed Be Thy Name”, written by Jacqueline Brook, it is written: “The comet [or literally, ""swordfish""] associated with Hermes shines bright green with an oval shape...”

On “…the brightest supernova in four centuries lit up the southern sky…” and began singing a song to the earth’s human beings.

If you are you’ll know that the lies being told by the scientists from the nations of the West are those born out of fear. Their fear comes from a knowing that the materialistic world that they have spent thousands of years building, and in defiance of the stewardship of this earth and its people’s safekeeping they were entrusted with, is soon to be no more.

While the great and terrible armies of the world and the vast and mysterious powers of the universe gather for battle, the peoples of the Western Nations remain asleep and in ignorance of their soon to come deaths. In this world today the Western peoples are truly lost, soulless and faceless, not knowing any of the events about to befall them.

From this slumber of theirs, we, and many others of our kind, have pledged ourselves to save as many as can be saved, not from the death of their human lives, but the death of their very souls.

744,"GENEVA - Nearly 3,000 participants from 117 countries, 53 heads of state and government, and close to 1,700 business leaders will gather at next week’s annual World Economic Forum in the plush Swiss Alpine resort of Davos. Geopolitical crises, climate change and the U.S.-China trade disputes are expected to top the forum’s large and challenging agenda.

The World Economic Forum is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year at a time of great uncertainty. The Forum’s founder and executive chairman, Klaus Schwab, warns the world is in a state of emergency and the window to act is quickly closing.

“We do not want to face continued political and economic disintegration. We do not want to reach the tipping point of irreversibility on climate change. And we do not want that the next generation to inherit a world, which becomes ever more hostile and ever less habitable. Just think of the wildfires in Australia,” he said.”

Schwab said no institution or individual alone can address the many economic, environmental, social, political and technological challenges facing the world. He said only collaboration among leading players can do this. He added the Forum offers a platform in which leaders can seek such cooperation.

Organizers of the Forum expect the large number of young environmentalists led by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg to energize the climate change debate. Discussions about the de-escalation of hostilities and instability in the Middle East are expected to loom large during the week-long discussions.

Key leaders, such as the president of Iraq and the president of Iraqi-Kurdistan, as well as the Pakistani and Afghan presidents, will be attending. But Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has canceled his appearance because of uncertainty in the region and growing discontent in his country.

Forum president Borge Brende told VOA that President Donald Trump will be coming with a high-powered delegation. It will include Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien.

“I think there will be a lot of trusted discussions on trade, on security, on de-escalation, and I hope our platform can be a conducive one for securing a more safe and more prosperous 2020 than we saw in 2019,” Brende said.

Trump is scheduled to arrive at the opening of the Forum’s 50th anniversary celebration next Tuesday. Brende said Trump will deliver an opening speech in which he will share his good wishes for the world and the United States of America.",mainstream,M09c0c,climate.change

Major Lunar Standstill On July 11th Has Russian Scientists Concerned Over Catastrophic Northwest, New Madrid Fault Zone Earthquakes

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Russian Subscribers

Russian Astro-Geologists from Yakut State University are reporting today on an increased likelihood of a major catastrophic earthquake in the Canadian-United States Pacific Northwest Region extending into ’s much feared New Madrid Fault Zone region during this weeks Full Moon which is occurring during a rare Major Lunar Standstill event, and which only happens every 18.6 years.

Though Western Scientists have relegated these rare Major Lunar Standstill events to their esoteric science of Astrology, Russian Astro-Geologists are likewise firm in their belief that these types of Solar System events do indeed have effects upon our Earth, and to almost all extents are catastrophic in nature.

An ‘informal’ explanation of a Lunar Standstill event we can read from the Wikipedia archives, and which says:

""At the major lunar standstill, which takes place every 18.6 years, the range of the declination of the Moon reaches a maximum. As a result, at high latitudes, the Moon appears to move in just two weeks from high in the sky to low on the horizon. This time appears to have had special significance for the Bronze Age societies who built the megalithic monuments in Britain, and it also has significance for some neo-pagan religions. The next major lunar standstill occurs in 2006.

As the Earth spins on its axis, the stars above us appear to move in circles. It appears to us as if all the stars are fixed in a great sphere surrounding us. In the same way that we measure positions on the earth using latitude and longitude, we measure positions of stars on this sphere in Right Ascension (equivalent to longitude) and Declination (equivalent to latitude). If you stand at a place on the earth which has latitude 50°, then the stars directly above you have a declination of 50°.

Unlike the stars, the Sun and Moon do not have a fixed declination. As the Earth travels its annual orbit around the Sun, with its rotational axis tilted at about 23.5° from the axis of orbital motion (a straight line joining a point on the tropic of cancer the 'opposite' point on the tropic of capricorn), the Sun's declination changes from +23.5° in June to -23.5° in December. Thus, in the Northern hemisphere, the Sun is higher in the sky in June, causing summer, than it is in December, when the Sun is low in the sky and is only above the horizon for a short time, causing winter.

The Moon also changes in declination, but it does so in only a month, instead of a year for the Sun. So it might go from a declination of +25° to -25° in just two weeks, returning to +25° two weeks later. Thus, in just one month the moon can move from being high in the sky, to low on the horizon, and back again.

But, unlike the Sun, the maximum and minimum declination reached by the Moon also varies. This is because the orbit of the Moon's revolution about the Earth is inclined by about 5° to the orbit of the Earth's revolution around the Sun, and so the maximum declination of the Moon varies from (23.5°-5°)=18.5° to (23.5°+5°)=28.5°. The effect of this is that at one particular time (the minor lunar standstill), the Moon will change its declination during the month from +18.5° to -18.5°, which is a total movement of 37°. This is not a particularly big change, and may not be very noticeable in the sky. However, 9.3 years later, during the major lunar standstill, the Moon will change its declination during the month from +28.5° to -28.5°, which is a total movement of 57°, and which is enough to take it from high in the sky to low on the horizon in just two weeks.""

Though the major concerns of these Scientists remain centered on the Canadian-United States Pacific Northwest and the United States New Madrid Fault Zone Regions an equal concern of imminent catastrophic earthquakes remains for America’s California Region, and which a major precursor to earthquake activity is now being reported, and as we can read as reported by the NBC 11 News Service in their article titled ""Dead Fish Mystery Perplexes Bay Area Biologists"", and which says:

""Thousands of fish in the Bay Area are turning up dead, and biologists still have no answers to this aquatic mystery. Over the last couple of months, an alarming number of dead fish and sharks have been washing up on Bay Area shores. In May, 40 sharks were found dead. Then, just a couple of weeks ago, 1,000 sturgeon and striped bass were found floating in the Bay and lying on shore, NBC11's Diane Dwyer reported.

Biologists said the phenomenon occurred between the San Mateo Bridge and the Dumbarton Bridge and between San Leandro and the Hayward shore on the East Bay. For fish and game biologist Becky Ota, the death of so many fish at one time is perplexing. ""Well, we are concerned about it,"" Ota said. ""The department's aware of it. We're trying to find out what the cause is, but it's been elusive. It's been a mystery so far. We haven't been able to pinpoint it yet.""

These reports further state that the July 6th mass solar ejection from Sun Spot 898 was another likely indicator of an impending catastrophic event due to the electromagnetic instability currently existing between these Regions, our Moon and the Sun.

More ominously, however, from these reports was the July 4th ‘Banging Earthquake’ reported in the United States Pacific Northwest Region, and as we can read as reported by the Peninsula Daily News Service in their article titled ""Fourth of July earthquake rattles region"", and which says:

""Residents from Port Townsend to Port Angeles felt a small earthquake measuring 3.6 on the Richter scale Tuesday afternoon, They reported dishes rattling, furniture moving and lamps swinging. The quake was centered under the Strait of Juan de Fuca almost halfway between Sequim and Victoria. The quake, centered 27 miles below the Strait's seabed, occurred at 1:37 p.m., the University of Washington's Department of Earth and Space Sciences reported.

There were no reports of damage or injury, but authorities said 10 persons in Port Townsend, 22 in Sequim and two in Port Angeles reported feeling the shaker. ``My windows rattled, and my roof started creaking,'' said Gus McDonald of Port Townsend in a telephone call to the Peninsula Daily News. Said Lois Cahill of Sequim: ``No one really knew what was happening, it just shook the dishes in kitchen.'' Peninsula Daily News photographer Keith Thorpe said the quake jiggled his computer monitor at his Port Angeles home. Some people in the greater Victoria area told CBC Radio they felt two tremors that happened about five seconds apart, accompanied by a loud bang.""

This ‘Banging Earthquake’ was also felt in Canada’s Pacific Northwest Region, and as we can read as reported by the Vancouver Sun News Service in their article titled ""Minor earthquake rattles southern Vancouver Island"", and which says, ""A minor earthquake measuring 3.7 on the Richter scale rumbled through southern Vancouver Island Tuesday afternoon, bringing the usual flurry of calls to the Pacific Geoscience Centre and a glut of hits to its website.""

These reports further state that Western Scientists are now acknowledging their Russian Scientific counterparts in warning of the likely increase of catastrophic earthquake and volcanic events due to Global Warming, and as we can see evidenced by the Canadian Press News Service in their article titled ""Climate change could cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, scientists say"", and which says:

""So the warnings of harsher heat waves, stronger hurricanes and rising seas fail to impress. How about volcanic eruptions in the Arctic, or a tsunami off the coast of Newfoundland? The latest scientific discipline to enter the fray over global warming is geology. And the forecasts from some quarters are dramatic - not only will the earth shake, it will spit fire. A number of geologists say glacial melting due to climate change will unleash pent-up pressures in the Earth's crust, causing extreme geological events such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. A cubic metre of ice weighs nearly a tonne and some glaciers are more than a kilometre thick. When the weight is removed through melting, the suppressed strains and stresses of the underlying rock come to life.""

Pressures upon the North American have likewise been increased due to the rapid melting of the massive Greenland Ice Sheet, and as we can read as reported by the Los Angeles Times News Service in their article titled ""Glaciers' melt rate surprises scientists"", and which says:

""The Greenland ice sheet -- two miles thick and broad enough to blanket an area the size of Mexico -- shapes the world's weather, matched in influence only by Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere. In its heart, snow that fell a quarter of a million years ago is preserved. Should all of the ice sheet ever thaw, the meltwater could raise sea level 21 feet and swamp the world's coastal cities, home to a billion people. It would cause higher tides, generate more powerful storm surges and, by altering ocean currents, drastically disrupt the global climate.

Climate experts have started to worry that the icecap is disappearing in ways that computer models had not predicted. By all accounts, the glaciers of Greenland are melting twice as fast as they were five years ago, even as the ice sheets of Antarctica also are shrinking, researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Kansas reported in February.

Researchers have focused on a delicate ribbon -- the equilibrium line, which marks the fulcrum of frost and thaw in Greenland's seasonal balance. The zone rims the icecap like a drawstring. Summer melting, on average, offsets the annual accumulation of snow. But across the icecap, the area of seasonal melting was broader last year than in 27 years of record-keeping, University of Colorado climate scientists reported. In early May, temperatures on the icecap some days were almost 20 degrees above normal, hovering just below freezing.

By 2005, Greenland was beginning to lose more ice volume than anyone had anticipated -- an annual loss of up to 52 cubic miles a year -- according to more recent satellite gravity measurements released by JPL. The volume of freshwater ice dumped into the Atlantic Ocean has almost tripled in a decade. There was even a period of melting in December. ""We have never seen that,"" Steffen said.

In an influential paper published in the journal Science, Zwally surmised that the ice sheets had accelerated in response to warmer temperatures, as summer meltwater lubricated the base of the ice sheet and allowed it to slide faster toward the sea. In a way no one had detected, the warm water made its way through thousands of feet of ice to the bedrock -- in weeks, not decades or centuries. University of Texas physicist Ginny Catania pulled an ice-penetrating radar in a search pattern around the camp, seeking evidence of any melt holes or drainage crevices that could so quickly channel the hot water of global warming deep into the ice.

To her surprise, she detected a maze of tunnels, natural pipes and cracks beneath the unblemished surface. ""I have never seen anything like it, except in an area where people have been drilling bore holes,"" Catania said.""

These reports rate the likelihood of a catastrophic 6.5 or higher magnitude earthquake event during this Major Lunar Standstill at: US Pacific/Canada Northwest Region 52%; New Madrid Fault Zone Region 51%; Caribbean Sea Region 43%; Mid Atlantic Ridge 41%; US/Canada Great Lakes Region 40%; California Region 38%; Mexico City 37%; and Panama Canal Region 36% between the dates of July 10th and July 13th.

220,"A hydrocarbon is an organic chemical compound composed exclusively of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Hydrocarbons are naturally-occurring compounds and form the basis of crude oil, natural gas, coal, and other important energy sources.

Hydrocarbons are highly combustible and produce carbon dioxide, water, and heat when they are burned. Therefore, hydrocarbons are highly effective as a source of fuel.

Hydrocarbons occur naturally throughout the world, originating from plant and animal fossils that have been formed by the forces of temperature and weight over millennia. They are mostly found deep underground, in porous rock formations (such as sandstone, limestone, and shale). Porous rock formations are often found in large bodies of water, so there is an immense quantity of hydrocarbons trapped deep beneath the oceans. Oil and natural gas exploration companies use advanced engineering techniques to identify these potential reservoirs and pull their resources to the surface for human use. Examples of such technologies include offshore oil platforms, directional drilling, and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques.

Hydrocarbons are very important for the modern economy. Globally, hydrocarbons are responsible for roughly 85% of energy consumption. This figure may actually understate the role of hydrocarbons in the economy by a significant margin because they are used in a wide range of applications aside from their use as a source of energy. For example, refined petroleum has been used to produce myriad derivative materials that play critical roles in the global economy, such as plastics, solvents, and lubricants.

Different techniques are used to extract hydrocarbons, depending on the type and location of the reserve. For example, hydraulic fracturing—better known as “fracking”—is used to extract natural gas from shale rock by using pressurized fracking fluid to create fissures through which the gas can escape to the surface. Mining is used to access oil sands, which are unconventional deposits of crude oil that are heavily intermixed with sand and sandstone.

Unfortunately, it is now understood that there is a serious environmental cost to using hydrocarbons as a primary source of energy. Greenhouse gasses released during the combustion of hydrocarbons are contributing to climate change. The process of oil and gas extraction can damage the surface environment and surrounding groundwater of the extraction site.

Many economists argue that hydrocarbon energy production involves substantial negative externalities that are not sufficiently represented in the market price of oil and gas. In fact, considering the mounting cost of climate-change-related phenomena, many argue that these externalities significantly outweigh any cost savings associated with hydrocarbons.

To address these concerns, there is a growing movement toward the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, nuclear, wind, and geothermal power. Alongside innovations in battery technology and “smart grid” infrastructure, these new energy alternatives may play a significantly larger role in global energy production in the years and decades ahead.",mainstream,M07eba,climate.change
1091,"CLIMATE change could render a fifth of the planet as hot as the Sahara Desert by 2070, according to a new study.

Scientists warned that a third of Earth's population will be forced to either abandon their homes or attempt to survive in ""near-unlivable"" conditions if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise over the next 50 years.

Many people would have to migrate to cooler regions as vast swathes of farmland is rendered useless, Earther reports.

The research involved the creation of a model that predicted future global warming trends.

It was built by an international team of researchers using historical data going back 6,000 years.

The model assumed that, over the next few decades, humanity will fail to act on climate change and will increase its greenhouse gas emissions over time.

Under these conditions, 20 per cent of the planet's landmass would experience Sahara-like temperatures year-round within the next fifty years, according to the study.

That means an average yearly temperature above a scorching 29C. Currently, around 0.8 per cent of the planet experiences that sort of heat year-round.

For comparison, Australia's yearly average temperature is 21C while Spain's is 13C.

The countries most affected if emissions continue to rise include India, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria and Somalia.

In India alone, 1.2billion people would be affected by the extra heat, researchers predicted.

They found that nations that are typically cold, such as Canada, Russia and the Antarctic, would gradually develop temperate climates.

Outside of these nations, the study predicted that the average temperature experienced by people in 2070 would be 7.5C higher than in pre-industrial times if global warming goes unchecked.

Scientists studied projected global population growth, the distribution of people over thousands of years and the rate of warming if emissions continue to rise.

They concluded that as many as 3.5billion people - a third of the projected population by 2070 - would face average temperatures above 29C if nothing is done about climate change.

Marten Scheffer, lead author from Wageningen University in the Netherlands, said these projections are ""unliveable for the ordinary, for poor people, for the average world citizen."".

He told USA Today: ""Large areas of the planet would heat to barely survivable levels and they wouldn't cool down.

""Not only would this have devastating direct effects, it leaves societies less able to cope with future crises like new pandemics. The only thing that can stop this happening is a rapid cut in carbon emissions.""

1182,"A noticeable increase in mean temperature has already been observed in Switzerland and summer temperatures up to 4.8 K warmer are expected by 2090. This article reviews the observed impacts of climate change on biodiversity and considers some perspectives for the future at the national level.

The following impacts are already evident for all considered taxonomic groups: elevation shifts of distribution towards mountain summits, spread of thermophilous species, colonisation by new species from warmer areas and phenological shifts. Additionally, in the driest areas, increasing droughts are affecting tree survival and fish species are suffering from warm temperatures in lowland regions. These observations are coherent with model projections, and future changes will probably follow the current trends.

These changes will likely cause extinctions for alpine species (competition, loss of habitat) and lowland species (temperature or drought stress). In the very urbanised Swiss landscape, the high fragmentation of the natural ecosystems will hinder the dispersal of many species towards mountains. Moreover, disruptions in species interactions caused by individual migration rates or phenological shifts are likely to have consequences for biodiversity. Conversely, the inertia of the ecosystems (species longevity, restricted dispersal) and the local persistence of populations will probably result in lower extinction rates than expected with some models, at least in 21st century. It is thus very difficult to estimate the impact of climate change in terms of species extinctions. A greater recognition by society of the intrinsic value of biodiversity and of its importance for our existence will be essential to put in place effective mitigation measures and to safeguard a maximum number of native species.",mainstream,M0a92d,climate.change

Chirping from the talus slopes of the Teton Range in the Rocky Mountains, the American pika ( ) sends a warning call to intruders—in this case humans climbing up the switchbacks in Grand Teton National Park’s Cascade Canyon. Sounding its alarm from a rocky perch, then darting into crevices and shadow on the steep slope, the rodent-sized, round-eared, brownish gray pika goes largely unnoticed. But as the second species petitioned for protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) because of climate change-associated threats (the polar bear was the first), the pika cannot afford to be overlooked for much longer.



 The American pika lives primarily at elevations between 8,000 and 13,000 feet, though it may be found at significantly lower elevations, including a little above sea level. Low-elevation pika populations, however, are at high risk of climate change, particularly local warming and decreased precipitation. Populations of pika in Yosemite National Park, for example, have migrated more than 500 feet upslope over the course of the last century, a shift coincident with a temperature increase of 5.4 °F in Yosemite during that same period of time. More significantly, over the course of only a decade—between 1999 and 2008—pikas in the Great Basin on the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada experienced a nearly five-fold increase in extinction rate and an 11-fold increase in the rate of upslope retreat. Pikas there are now moving upslope at a rate of 475 feet per decade.

In 2010, despite the documented loss of pikas and evidence linking pika declines and range shifts with climate change, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) decided not to protect the American pika under the ESA. The decision was denounced by the nonprofit Centers for Biological Diversity, which had petitioned for the species’ protection, and was supported by some biologists, who claimed that most populations of the American pika are stable.

Pikas, however, are highly susceptible to warm temperatures and will die within several hours of constant exposure to temperatures of 75 to 78 °F. Their survival also appears to depend heavily on contiguous habitat. For instance, a study of historical pika population sites in the southern Rockies, where pika habitat extends over a large area, revealed that just four out of 69 populations had been extirpated since the 1980s. The extirpations occurred at sites that were once wet but that had dried out over the course of the last 100 years.

Contiguous habitat and upslope migration are the pika’s only hope for escape from local climate warming and drying. But at higher elevations, food may be scarce and the climate too cold, and given the isolation of pika populations, it remains to be seen whether migration and dispersal to new areas can actually rescue the species. Furthermore, several decades into the future, the high, mountainous elevations where pikas can now find refuge may no longer be cool and wet enough to support their survival.

Indeed, climate prediction models have suggested that summertime temperatures in pika habitat will increase by 5.4 °F by 2050. While the FWS cited this figure in its report explaining why pika do not warrant protection under the ESA, such an increase will render the lower elevations of many mountain ranges, including the Teton Range, uninhabitable for pika. And while it is difficult to predict precise temperature increases beyond 2050, temperatures likely will continue to rise, forcing the American pika higher and higher, further restricting its range and its chances of survival in the process.",mainstream,M11d94,climate.change

In response to news that Joe Biden is somehow polling favourably against President Trump, Fox news dredged up a 2012 story about how Osama Bin Laden wanted to assassinate Barack Obama, so that a ‘totally unprepared’ Biden would become President.

The Biden of a decade ago was a spring chicken compared to the sad figure we see today who struggles to string two words together.

Here’s the latest example. An “interview” Biden conducted with Al Gore, labelled ‘A Virtual Climate Change Town Hall’.

The purpose of the… thing… was for Gore to endorse Biden. However, the highlight is watching Gore’s utterly confused face as he attempts to work out what on Earth Biden is talking about throughout.

The big question… “is it too late to aggress climate change?”:

Remember that famous JFK quote “We’re doing this because we refuse to postpone”:

Gore described it as a ‘no brainer’ for him to endorse Biden.

Indeed, while Gore’s mouth was endorsing Biden, his brain was surely thinking ‘Jesus, Trump is going to obliterate this dude in the debates.’

605,"(Reuters) - Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) said on Monday it will invest 1 billion euros in a fund to invest in climate change projects and reduce to net zero greenhouse gas emissions from all its products by 2039, 11 years ahead of the Paris Agreement deadline.

Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company whose brands include Dove soap and Knorr soup, said it was responding to the “scale and urgency” of the climate change crisis.

The fund will invest in projects including reforestation, water preservation and carbon sequestration over the next ten years, it said.

The net zero emission target is an extension of efforts already underway to cut emissions within the company by 2030 - such as reducing electricity consumption within offices.

Unilever’s total greenhouse gas footprint was around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2019 according to its website.

“We are now going much wider in our commitments, we call it a cradle to shelf commitment...across the value chain,” Unilever Chief Supply Chain Officer, Marc Engel said.

Unilever, which has an annual turnover of 52 billion euros ($58.5 billion), said it would prioritise partnerships with suppliers who have set emission reduction targets and has set up a system where suppliers must declare the carbon footprint of goods and services provided. All packaging will show the carbon footprint of the product in the future, the company said.

Unilever joins a handful of companies in promising net zero emissions from their supply chain.

Kit-Kat maker Nestle (NESN.S) and German elevator maker Thyssenkrupp AG (TKAG.DE) are others though their targets are set for 2050, which is the deadline set by the Paris Agreement on climate change to limit global warming to 1.5° degrees.

Unilever on Monday also said that it aims to make all product formulations biodegradable and achieve a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023, among a raft of other moves to fight climate change.

The company said it will use satellite monitoring, geolocation tracking and blockchain among other digital technologies to increase traceability and transparency within its supply chain.",mainstream,M0f9c8,climate.change

(CNN) The Earth and its inhabitants face three global crises: the pandemic crisis, the climate crisis and biodiversity crisis. Unto themselves, each already feels overwhelming -- in terms of public-health consequences, the speed and scale of impacts, and the transformative actions needed to keep the planet habitable.

One commonality lies at the core of these massive global challenges: the destructive relationship between humanity and the natural world. Human activities drive these invisible enemies, and our hope for the future will derive from solutions based on caring for nature.

With Covid-19-related mortality expected to be high in vulnerable populations , at least one expert, NYU climate economist Gernot Wagner, has likened the pandemic to "" climate change at warp speed ."" The exponential growth rate of Covid-19 makes the pandemic far more apparent to most people, on a daily basis, than a warming planet. Yet the devastating recent fires in Australia and the loss of Pacific islands to sea-level rise remove any doubt that climate change is a fast-moving crisis.

We already know the links between climate change and the third crisis , biodiversity loss. A 2019 report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services outlined the consequences for humanity of the rampant erosion of ecosystems across Earth.

The report highlighted clear evidence of reductions in pollination, water regulation, soil health and pollution regulation among a myriad of lost ""natural capital."" It also provided evidence that intact ecosystems -- especially our vast tropical and boreal forests -- play a critical role in abating runaway climate change. These areas soak up around 30% of mankind's carbon emissions each year and will continue to provide this huge service if effectively conserved.

Such natural systems also offer humanity its best defense against climate change by regulating local climate, for example, and reducing risks of climate-related hazards such as sea-level rise and floods. Areas of high biological diversity often also hold a high level of viral diversity. As such, increased degradation of our world's intact ecosystems can pose human health risks.

Scientists use the term ""zoonosis"" to refer to infectious diseases like Covid-19 (caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2) that spread from animals to humans. The current pandemic has been associated with a market in Wuhan, China, where the flow of wild animals from forest frontiers to urban communities likely provided the source of infection.

Yet wild animals themselves do not cause the problem. Rather, people continue to place increased pressures on the Earth's remaining biodiverse ecosystems . Activities such as the commercial wildlife trade, logging and deforestation, and the expansion of agriculture into previously undisturbed areas alter the ""normal"" circulation of viruses. These changes can increase contact and exchange-rates of pathogens between wildlife and humans.

In other words, as humanity encroaches further into nature, people have a greater chance of coming into contact with new pathogens carried by animals, and humanity finds itself at greater risk of pandemics like the one unfolding now.

The problems of pandemics, climate and biodiversity loss are linked -- but so are the solutions.

Ending the commercial trade of wildlife for human consumption would drastically mitigate that exposure, limiting the risk of pathogens spilling over from animals to humans and causing disease outbreaks. At the same time, protecting ecosystems from human encroachment helps maintain biodiversity and mitigate climate change, by maintaining plant life that absorbs carbon from the atmosphere.

Only a few months ago, we looked to 2020 as the ""super year"" for biodiversity and climate change . Nations that signed onto international conventions on climate (CoP 26) and biodiversity (CoP 15) hoped to finalize global strategic plans looking to 2030. With the key climate and biodiversity meetings delayed due to the pandemic, coordinated action remains pressing. Perhaps the Covid-19 crisis itself may still bring negotiators together (in spirit if not in person) for unified action, if the global pandemic manages to rouse a sense of solidarity among world governments.

When it comes to reducing threats to our health, the climate, and biodiversity, we know that the tools of protecting intact forests and reducing forest degradation work well. The world -- and all its citizens and leaders -- must embrace natural solutions to head off these three crises. Proactively conserving and restoring our remaining intact ecosystems represents a key strategy to halt climate change, biodiversity loss, and -- we must hope -- the next pandemic.

This article has been updated to clarify that the authors argue ending commercial wildlife trade for human consumption, specifically, would mitigate human exposure to pathogens. It has also been updated to reflect that James Watson is a professor, not associate professor, of conservation science at the University of Queensland.",mainstream,M0b950,climate.change; global.warming
265,"The evidence for anthropogenic climate change is now clear and convincing. The Earth’s surface has warmed by more than 0.8 °C over the past century, and by approximately 0.6 °C in the past three decades.1 This warming has been linked to more extreme weather conditions such as intense floods and droughts, heavier and more frequent storms, and a possible increase in frequency and intensity of the El Niño Southern Oscillation. These changes are largely caused by human activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) that traps heat within the atmosphere. These CO2 emissions continue to rise, and climate models project the average surface temperature will rise by 1.1 °C to 6.4 °C over the 21st century.2

Since 1990, WHO has published a series of reports on climate change and has participated in review processes such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. These activities have outlined four key characteristics of the health risks generated by a warming and a more variable climate. First, these hazards are diverse, global and probably irreversible over human time scales. They range from increased risks of extreme weather, such as fatal heat waves, floods and storms, to less dramatic but potentially more serious effects on infectious disease dynamics, shifts to long-term drought conditions in many regions, melting of glaciers that supply freshwater to large population centres, and sea level increases leading to salination of sources of agriculture and drinking water. Second, the health impacts of climate change are potentially huge. Many of the most important global killers are highly sensitive to climatic conditions. Malaria, diarrhoea and protein-energy malnutrition together cause more than 3 million deaths each year.3 Third, these risks are inequitable, in that the greenhouse gases that cause climate change originate mainly from developed countries, but the health risks are concentrated in the poorest nations, which have contributed least to the problem.4 Finally, many of the projected impacts on health are avoidable, through a combination of public health interventions in the short term, support for adaptation measures in health-related sectors such as agriculture and water management, and a long-term strategy to reduce human impacts on climate.

Threats to health are often cited to justify actions to mitigate or adapt to climate change; for example, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s 2006 speech in Nairobi.5 For all the attention that these issues receive, however, a comprehensive strategy to support a public health response is conspicuously lacking. This strategy is urgently needed, both because the health community has a duty to counter emerging threats, and because increased attention to climate change offers opportunities to focus on the most disadvantaged populations’ current needs. For example, the international community has agreed on the principle of a global climate change adaptation fund, funded by a 2% levy on a multibillion-dollar Clean Development Mechanism.6 However, this opportunity to strengthen public health can be seized only if the health sector knows what it should do differently because of climate change.

The development of a comprehensive strategy will take time, but some essential principles are already clear. A global problem requires a strategy of international dimensions that can translate into regional and local actions. Just as climate change’s underlying causes are global, its health implications do not respect national boundaries. Impacts in one location, such as infectious disease epidemics or population displacements caused by droughts or rising sea levels, quickly spread across national borders. Coordinated investments in preventive measures therefore contribute to the “global public good” of reducing the risk of health emergencies.

The challenge is simplified somewhat by the fact that climate change is expected to lead mainly to changes in existing health issues rather than to the emergence of new and unfamiliar diseases. An important guiding principle therefore is to increase the priority given to currently important health burdens that are likely to be worsened by climate change. Such a “no regrets” strategy will bring important public health benefits under any plausible future climate conditions.

Adaptation to climate change is essentially a matter of basic public health protection. The challenges of rapid environmental, demographic and social changes all call for greater emphasis on disease prevention, providing a better balance with the current focus on curative and reactive measures. The necessary preventive actions to deal with most climate-sensitive diseases are already quite clear. Climate change and other environmental stresses should help to refocus political and financial commitments to implement these measures.

One emerging environmental health threat is the decline in global freshwater resources, caused mainly by increasing rates of water extraction and contamination. Climate change is expected to worsen this decline in water quality and quantity, particularly in already dry regions such as the eastern Mediterranean and north Africa. Scaling up water and sanitation services and providing point-of-use disinfection would reduce the current burden of disease and ameliorate the health impacts of decreasing water supplies. Such interventions already have a very high cost–benefit ratio;7 the threat of climate change makes these preventive health measures an even wiser investment. As water stresses intensify, governments could protect health by strengthening and enforcing their regulatory frameworks to ensure the safe use of new water sources that will become increasingly important: wastewater, excreta and greywater in agriculture and aquaculture.8

Effective surveillance and response systems are essential in managing any infectious disease, but they become even more important under conditions of rapid change. These conditions include climatic shifts as well as increasing rates of movement of and contact between humans, pathogens and reservoirs. These conditions all require improved human health surveillance integrated with monitoring of climate and other environmental conditions that favour disease outbreaks, including disease in wildlife and agricultural animals. Climate change also strengthens the case for reinforcing response systems for infectious disease outbreaks, including predefined action plans and maintenance of the control resources and personnel capacity necessary to mount effective responses.

The impacts of current and future natural disasters could be reduced by the health sector defining integrated measures that address the root causes of vulnerability, and planning for effective responses after such events. For example, the health impacts of floods can be reduced by land management policies that reduce deforestation and conserve the integrity of watersheds and coastal zones, minimize the physical impacts of mudslides and storm surges, and decrease the chances of sewage contamination. Post-flooding health effects can be reduced by adequately planned and funded health-sector responses, including interventions to control outbreaks of vector-borne and water-related diseases.

Since 2000, WHO has worked with the World Meteorological Organization and the UN Environment Programme to raise awareness of climate change’s implications for the health sectors of highly vulnerable regions. The necessary next step is to inform and support national health actors in taking concrete actions to protect health. For example, WHO is addressing this need by initiating a new project in 2006 on piloting approaches to protect health in changing climates.9 In partnership with the UN Development Programme and with funding from the Global Environmental Facility, this initiative is being implemented in seven vulnerable countries. In each, the national health ministry chairs an intersectoral team that has identified priority health risks from climate change given local environmental socioeconomic and health contexts. Through the course of the initiative, this team will also identify, implement, monitor and refine interventions to minimize health risks. The project will thereby support targeted interventions in these countries, strengthen institutional capacity to address health risks, involve an increasingly informed and engaged health sector in adapting to climate change, and extract lessons that are applicable to other countries. It will also develop monitoring mechanisms to ensure that resources are applied effectively in adaptation projects within the health sector, and inform evaluations of support through this mechanism as compared with more general health or development aid. This initiative is important preparation for the wider action that will be necessary to meet the worldwide challenge of adapting to health risks from climate change.

The actions described above represent “safe investments” for climate change adaptation funds within the health sector. However, many climatic risks to health lie at least partly outside the health sector’s normal sphere of action. Perhaps most critically, climate change has the capacity to suppress agricultural yields, with the greatest risks in Africa,10 where malnutrition is already the largest single contributor to disease burdens.11 Some of the most effective actions by health professionals may therefore involve supporting other sectors’ efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

Much work still needs to be done in this area, including:

Ultimately, however, the public health community needs to go beyond reacting to a changing climate. A true preventive strategy needs to ensure the maintenance and development of healthy environments from local to global levels. In the long term, sustainable development and protection of ecosystem services are fundamentally necessary for human health.13 This is not just a case of protecting future generations, as even in the short term development choices that protect the climate can benefit public health significantly.

The intersection of energy, transport, climate and health provides an example of this. The Stern Review of the economics of climate change argues that the long-term benefits of major investments to cut greenhouse gas emissions would vastly outweigh their costs, and that these are needed to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts on the global economy.12 This coincides with a WHO assessment that feasible improvements in environmental conditions could reduce the global disease burden by more than 25%.14 Much of the current burden is due to unhealthy energy and transport services. Changing these systems to reduce climate change could therefore also bring significant and largely unacknowledged public health gains. Improving access to public and active transport would greatly reduce CO2 emissions, while also cutting the 800 000 annual global deaths from outdoor air pollution, the 1.2 million annual deaths from traffic accidents, and the 1.9 million deaths from physical inactivity.11 Changing the poorest communities’ domestic energy technologies could reduce the 1.5 million annual indoor air pollution deaths.15 The critical next stage for the health community is a more direct and assertive engagement with the environment and economic sectors to ensure that health-supporting technological and development choices are implemented.

Human-induced climate change is an emerging threat that rightly commands widespread policy and public attention. Along with other rapid changes associated with global population and economic growth, climate change strains existing weak points in health protection systems and calls for reconsideration of public health priorities. The most effective responses are likely to be strengthening of the key functions of environmental management, surveillance and response to safeguard health from natural disasters and changes in infectious disease patterns, and a more pro-active approach to ensure that development decisions serve the ultimate goal of improving human health.16 For the most part these are not new interventions but existing tools underutilized due to the “true killers”: lack of political commitment and of financial resources.17 Climate change therefore demands that we intensify our efforts in preventive public health and place that crucial task at the core of sustainable development. ■

1120,"UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. climate chief says world leaders must recognize there is no option except to speed-up and scale-up action to tackle global warming, warning that continuing on the current path will lead to “a catastrophe.”

Patricia Espinosa stressed in two recent interviews with the Associated Press that climate scientists are saying there’s still a chance to make things right “but the window of opportunity is closing very soon” and the world has 12 years until carbon emissions reach “a point of no return.”

That means the world needs to accelerate all efforts to keep from reaching that level, “and therefore all efforts are absolutely indispensable” to cut carbon emissions and keep temperatures from rising, she said.

Some top scientists say reaching the “tipping point” in 12 years is an oversimplification of a U.N. report last year.

Espinosa said carbon emissions were expected to rise in the immediate future after the landmark Paris agreement was adopted in 2015 to address climate change because the transformations needed to go to a downward trajectory “cannot be done overnight.” In addition, global population is growing and more people demand more energy and resources, she said.

“What has become clear, however, is that if we continue to grow or to behave in a way that this kind of trajectory is maintained we will not be able to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement,” said Espinosa, who is executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The Paris agreement called for global temperatures to rise a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius, so the goal is really about preventing another 1 or 0.5 degrees Celsius (1.8 or 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) increase from now.

A report last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, concluded that while it’s technically possible to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, it is highly unlikely because this would require a dramatic overhaul of the global economy, including a shift away from fossil fuels. Deep in the report, scientists say less than 2% of 529 of their calculated possible future scenarios kept warming below the 1.5 degree C (2.7 degrees F) goal.

“What science is showing now since Paris is that 1.5 degrees C is really necessary because the consequences of staying at 2 degrees C are very big,” Espinosa said. “And secondly, it is also showing that 1.5 degrees C is possible. It takes more effort. It takes much more political will.”

She said the IPCC scientists gave the world 12 years “to speed-up and scale-up the actions” to cut emissions before they start spiraling out of control.

“It doesn’t mean that we need to wait 12 years and then look at it as the moment to do this,” Espinosa said. “It means that we need to accelerate the tipping point, and therefore all efforts are absolutely indispensable.”

The U.N. report does not say 2030, the date used, is a last chance, hard deadline for action, as it has been interpreted in some quarters.

The panel “did not say we have 12 years left to save the world,” James Skea, co-chairman of the report and professor of sustainable energy at Imperial College London, told The Associated Press. “The hotter it gets, the worse it gets, but there is no cliff edge.”

“This has been a persistent source of confusion,” agreed Kristie L. Ebi, director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington in Seattle. “The report never said we only have 12 years left.”

Espinosa said in an interview Tuesday that the attention the issue is getting “is clearly growing” but not “at the speed and the breadth that it should.”

Governments get trapped in dealing with immediate needs “and we are not yet in a situation where we can say we have a broad understanding that the threat to climate change is part of those immediate needs,” Espinosa said.

She said communities that suffer destruction from the effects of climate change have woken up, the movement by children from schools around the world is “a wake-up call,” and mass protests to combat climate change will hopefully spur decision-makers.

But Espinosa said some people say climate change isn’t happening, “this is not man-made,” and “others are just very, very indifferent to the issue.”

“So we have a lot of work to do to still to get everybody on board,” she said. “We have a very long, long way to go.”

Espinosa stressed that the goal is “to get to a moment where leaders recognize that there is no option.”

“The truth is that if we continue to produce, consume, to function as we are doing now, we know that we are going toward a catastrophe,” she said, and that will mean loss of lives, serious impacts on different sectors of the economy, massive displacement and instability.

Leaders must understand “that the business as usual scenario is not an option anymore,” she said.

To those who question how the goal of 1.5 degrees C can be achieved, Espinosa asked: “How can we ignore a goal that is absolutely necessary to avoid really catastrophic consequences?”

U.S. President Donald Trump announced in 2017 that the U.S. will pull out of the Paris climate accord unless he can get a better deal — a possibility that others such as the European Union and China have dismissed.

“We want to engage with the U.S. government and listen to their concerns and see how we can maybe address them together,” Espinosa said. “I’m still hopeful that there could be reconsideration of this decision.”

She noted that many places in the United States are being severely affected by climate change “so I believe this can also bring political leaders in the U.S. to try to exercise their influence in hopefully looking at this issue one more time.”

Even without support from the Trump administration, Espinosa said, there is a lot of U.S. leadership on climate change from the business sector, regions, governors, mayors and ordinary Americans which “we see with great optimism.”",mainstream,M111bf,climate.change
298,"“I am telling you Global Warming is a nonevent, a manufactured crisis and a total scam… It is all a scam, the result of bad science.” —John Coleman, Weather channel founder and lifelong meteorologist

Science is trustworthy, right? Science is supposed to be reliable, based upon fact, unprejudiced, and trustworthy, isn’t it? Well, think again. A lot of what passes for science these days is utter nonsense, pseudo-science (i.e., false science), and a lot of scientific fact is hidden from public view because it’s not politically correct. It is absurdly comical what is commonly mislabeled as “science” these days.

The “Discovery” channel recently produced a laughable documentary on Greenland's alleged “melting glaciers.” Oh boy! Here we go again with Global Warming. It's really a comedy. A team was flown in by helicopter to actually install special plastic covers over a 2-acre area to reflect the sun’s rays and help prevent the glacier from melting. They spent 3-days in 60 M.P.H. gusts of frigid wind, in chill factors well below zero, with millions of dollars worth of equipment and materials, to cover a mere 2-acres of the glacier. That’s like covering one grain of sand on the biggest beach in the world. They said it would cost $186,000,000,000 just to cover a small fraction of Greenland’s glaciers to combat the effects of Global Warming. Their major concern was that such a project would also require 21,000,000 helicopter trips, which would dump enormous amounts of Carbon Dioxide (i.e. greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere. The whole idea of preventing a glacier from melting is insane!

If indeed the earth’s glaciers are melting, attempting to stop them from melting by covering them with reflective material wouldn’t work. According to Global Warming proponents the earth’s temperature is increasing. So what good would it do to cover the glaciers? The sun’s rays are not the problem. This just shows the fallacy of Global Warming. One minute they claim that the earth’s temperature is rising, and then they set out to protect Greenland’s glaciers from the sun’s rays. Well, which is it, the sun’s rays or the higher temperatures on earth? If, as Global Warming proponents claim, the earth’s temperatures are rising, then protecting glaciers from the sun’s rays is a complete waste of time and money.

I’ve been reading about a “global warming tax” for some time now and I think this is the ultimate goal of all this scare-mongering… an international global warming tax! If you want the truth behind any agenda… follow the money. It's just a matter of time. Our taxes shouldn't be wasted on junk science.

You know, why didn’t we hear about Global Warming 30-years ago? Has planet earth changed that much in just a few decades? No! One violent volcanic eruption emits more gases and pollution into the earth’s atmosphere than all the cars and industries in America combined in just a single year. The sun itself generates enough radiation to penetrate the earth’s crust and maintain a molten core of lava. Who’s kidding who? How did mankind survive for Millenniums without combating the Global Warming boogie man?

Even the founder of the Weather channel and a lifelong meteorologist, John Coleman, has candidly stated publicly that Global Warming is a big scam. I’ve quoted the entire article here because it’s something that everyone needs to read…

It is the greatest scam in history. I am amazed, appalled and highly offended by it. Global Warming; It is a SCAM. 

 

 Some dastardly scientists with environmental and political motives manipulated long term scientific data back in the late 1990's to create an allusion of rapid global warming. Other scientists of the same environmental wacko type jumped into the circle to support and broaden the ""research"" to further enhance the totally slanted, bogus global warming claims. Their friends in government steered huge research grants their way to keep the movement going. Soon they claimed to be a consensus. 

 

 Environmental extremist, notable politicians among them then teamed up with movie, media and other liberal, environmentalist journalists to create this wild ""scientific"" scenario of the civilization threatening environmental consequences from Global Warming unless we adhere to their radical agenda. 

 

 Now their ridicules manipulated science has been accepted as fact and become a cornerstone issue for CNN, CBS, NBC, the Democratic Political Party, the Governor of California, school teachers and, in many cases, well informed but very gullible environmental conscientious citizens. Only one reporter at ABC has been allowed to counter the Global Warming frenzy with one 15 minutes documentary segment. 

 

 I do not oppose environmentalism. I do not oppose the political positions of either party. 

 

 However, Global Warming, i.e. Climate Change, is not about environmentalism or politics. It is not a religion. It is not something you ""believe in."" It is science; the science of meteorology. This is my field of life-long expertise. And I am telling you Global Warming is a nonevent, a manufactured crisis and a total scam. I say this knowing you probably won't believe me, a mere TV weatherman, challenging a Nobel Prize, Academy Award and Emmy Award winning former Vice President of United States. So be it. 

 

 I suspect you might like to say to me, ""John, look the research that supports the case for global warming was done by research scientists; people with PH D's in Meteorology. They are employed by major universities and important research institutions. Their work has been reviewed by other scientists with PH D's. They have to know a lot more about it than you do. Come on, John, get with it. The experts say our pollution has created an strong and increasing greenhouse effect and a rapid, out of control global warming is underway that will sky rocket temperatures, destroy agriculture, melt the ice caps, flood the coastlines and end life as we know it. How can you dissent from this crisis? You must be a bit nutty. 

 

 Allow me, please, to explain how I think this all came about. Our universities have become somewhat isolated from the rest of us. There is a culture and attitudes and values and pressures on campus that are very different. I know this group well. My father and my older brother were both PHD-University types. I was raised in the university culture. Any person who spends a decade at a university obtaining a PHD in Meteorology and become a research scientist, more likely than not, becomes a part of that single minded culture. They all look askance at the rest of us, certain of their superiority. They respect government and disrespect business, particularly big business. They are environmentalists above all else. 

 

 And, there is something else. These scientists know that if they do research and results are in no way alarming, their research will gather dust on the shelf and their research careers will languish. But if they do research that sounds alarms, they will become well known and respected and receive scholarly awards and, very importantly, more research dollars will come flooding their way. 

 

 So when these researchers did climate change studies in the late 90's they were eager to produce findings that would be important and be widely noticed and trigger more research funding. It was easy for them to manipulate the data to come up with the results they wanted to make headlines and at the same time drive their environmental agendas. Then their like minded PHD colleagues reviewed their work and hastened to endorse it without question. 

 

 There were a few who didn't fit the mold. They did ask questions and raised objections. They did research with contradictory results. The environmental elitists berated them brushed their studies aside. 

 

 I have learned since the Ice Age is coming scare in the 1970's to always be a skeptic about research. In the case of global warming, I didn't accept media accounts. Instead I read dozens of the scientific papers. I have talked with numerous scientists. I have studied. I have thought about it. I know I am correct when I assure you there is no run away climate change. The impact of humans on climate is not catastrophic. Our planet is not in peril. It is all a scam, the result of bad science. 

 

 I am not alone in this assessment. There are hundreds of other meteorologists, many of them PH D's, who are as certain as I am that this global warming frenzy is based on bad science and is not valid. 

 

 I am incensed by the incredible media glamour, the politically correct silliness and rude dismal of counter arguments by the high priest of Global Warming. 

 

 In time, a decade or two, the outrageous scam will be obvious. As the temperature rises, polar ice cap melting, coastal flooding and super storm pattern all fail to occur as predicted everyone will come to realize we have been duped. 

 

 The sky is not falling. And, natural cycles and drifts in climate are as much if not more responsible for any climate changes underway. 

 

 I strongly believe that the next twenty years are equally as likely to see a cooling trend as they are to see a warming trend.

Science has been politicized—not by the Right; but by the Left, which sees global warming, Darwinism, stem cell research, and innumerable other issues as tools to advance its agenda (and in many cases expand the reach of government). When liberals parade out scientists with white coats, debate is supposed to be silenced. But many of the high priests of science have something to hide—from blind intolerance of Biblical claims to greedy guarding of their federally financed research budgets. What a waste of tax-payer money!

""Science"" means ""the study of"" something. Therefore, to qualify as legitimate science, there MUST be something to study. Evolution is a perfect example of FALSE science. There is nothing to study in evolution. Evolution CANNOT be studied! It CANNOT be tested? It CANNOT be monitored or examined? In fact, all available scientific evidence shows that evolution is NOT true in the least.

In the same manner, Global Warming is bad science, i.e., there are NO solid scientific research findings to support their doomsday scenario. The “evidence” at best is far-fetched and purely circumstantial. I remember hearing Al Gore claim several years back that massive flooding in China was caused by Global Warming. Such alleged “evidence” of Global Warming is ridiculous. Suspiciously, Gore and other Global Warming proponents have remained silent concerning record-breaking cold temperatures in recent years. For example: In 2007 New York City set an all-time low record of 59 degrees for the month of August. In January of 2004, Boston's Logan International Airport recorded a low of 3 below zero, two degrees chillier than the previous record for January 10, set in 1875. It was the city's coldest day since January 16, 1994, when thermometers registered 4 below. Meanwhile, on that day in New York City, Al Gore was giving a speech about the effects of global warming! In 2007, Chicago experienced the 6th coldest February on record since 1871 and the coldest February in nearly three decades. Global Warming? You decide!

Historical climate records clearly evidence that there are normal “cycles” of short-term and long-term weather patterns. Thus such terms as “El Nino” (warmer) and “La Nina” (cooler) are used to identify the normal temperature change patterns in the ocean. It is sad that many people are gullible enough to believe Global Warming exists simply because someone shows them a video of water flowing from a glacier. I remember as a kid seeing snow melting on the rooftop of the house and draining into the guitars, even though it was close to zero degrees outside. I noticed that big icicles dripped from the heat of sun, even though it was only 10 degrees outside. So why should it be surprising that water should flow from a glacier when the sun shines upon it? It is normal.

I saw a bumper sticker the other day which read... ""I believe the Big Bang Theory... God spoke and BANG, it happened."" I thought that was pretty good, and it is certainly Biblical. It is far more reasonable to believe the Bible; than it is to believe the hocus-pocus nonsense of a bunch of whacko scientists. Just as Evolution, Global Warming is a scam—a cleverly devised invention of greedy and dishonest people.",conspiracy,C02981,climate.change; global.warming
892,"An increasing number of younger Americans are blaming climate change for not putting away money for their own retirement. They say that because the world won’t exist when they retire (because of climate change) there’s no need to save any money.

But if we apply that logic to everything, there is never a need to prepare for the future of anything and the liberal ideology crumbles upon itself.

Market Watch used a young professional as an example of this flawed thinking. Lori Rodriguez, a 27-year-old communications professional in New York City, is not saving for retirement, and it isn’t necessarily because she can’t afford to, but because she doesn’t expect it to matter. Like many people her age, Rodriguez has bought into the propaganda and religiously believes that climate change will have catastrophic effects on our planet. Some 88% of millennials (a higher percentage than any other age group) believe in the climate change religion and 69% say it will impact them in their lifetimes.

“I want to hope for the best and plan for a future that is stable and secure, but, when I look at current events and at the world we are predicting, I do not see how things could not be chaotic in 50 years,” Rodriguez says. 

 Author and real estate entrepreneur Stefan Aarnio joins Owen Shroyer live via Skype to discuss his book “Hard Times Create Strong Men” and reveal how to be an alpha male in the age of toxic feminism. “The weather systems are already off, and I don’t think it’s hyperbolic to be a little apocalyptic.”

The mainstream media isn’t helping either. Using manipulation techniques, the media engulfs people in a constant barrage of depressing and hate-filled news stories. So much so, that many young people are skeptical about saving for a future they are constantly being told won’t exist.

Just to clarify for these younger people, in 2008 liberal hero Al Gore predicted that there would be no polar ice caps in three to five years because of global warming. However, the “inconvenient truth” is that the ice caps are still there today (over ten years later).

Interestingly enough, right after stating that younger Americans don’t save for retirement because they believe climate change will destroy the world, Market Watchclarified that mental health could be an issue.

Jean Twenge, who authored the study cited by Market Watch, says this spike in mental health issues may be attributed to the increased use of digital media. Technology has changed modes of indoctrination just enough to impact social lives and communication. Millennials are also said to suffer from “eco-anxiety,” according to a 2018 report from the American Psychological Association, with 72% saying their emotional well-being is affected by the inevitability of climate change, compared with just 57% of people over the age of 45.

Two-thirds of millennials (defined by Pew as the generation born between 1981 and 1996) have nothing saved for retirement, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security. And now we know why some aren’t saving. The religion of climate change has a death grip on their mental stability.

It isn’t that we don’t want to take the planet. Those who don’t subscribe to the climate change religion of hysteria simply believe that people should care for the Earth the best way they can. Putting the Earth’s salvation in the hands of a few bureaucrats isn’t going to solve anything. After all, government officials can’t even clean up a trash pile in the Democrat’s paradise of Los Angeles. If climate change was really a problem, there’s no way authoritarians could solve it nor would they want too. There’s just too much money to be made off the gullible masses.

374,"Nations rich and poor must invest now to protect against destructive climate change impacts already in the pipeline or pay an even heavier price later, a global commission led by former UN head Ban Ki-moon warned Tuesday.

Spending $1.8 trillion across five key areas over the next decade would not only help buffer the worst impacts of global warming but could generate more than $7 trillion in net benefits, the report from the Global Commission on Adaptation argued.

""Global actions to slow climate change are promising but insufficient,"" the report concluded. ""We must invest in a massive effort to adapt to conditions that are now inevitable.""

Investing now in early warning systems, climate-resistant infrastructure, mangrove protection, better agriculture and improving fresh water resources would pay for itself several times over, it said.

Mangroves -- tropical tidal water forests -- protect, for example, against storm surges and act as nurseries for commercial fisheries, but at least a third of them globally have been uprooted for tourism or aquaculture.

Without action by 2030, Ban told journalists, ""climate change could push more than 100 million people in developing countries below the poverty line"".

""People everywhere are experiencing the devastating impacts of climate change,"" said Microsoft founder Bill Gates, co-chair of the report along with World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva.

In the 25-year history of UN climate negotiations, adaptation has trailed far down the agenda compared with ""mitigation"", or the reduction of carbon emissions.

It was long seen as an issue only affecting poor and developing nations.

But recent massive inland flooding and a string of record-breaking hurricanes in the United States, along with ferocious heatwaves in Europe and Japan, have shown that wealth is not an adequate shield.

""This is not just in the developing world but the developed world too,"" said Dominic Molloy, a co-author of the report from Britain's Department for International Development.

But a new focus on adapting should not detract from the need to slash carbon pollution, he added.

""We absolutely need to do both, reduce emissions and adapt,"" Molloy told AFP. ""The purpose of this commission was to raise the visibility of adaptation, not shift away from mitigation.""

Failure to curb the greenhouse gas emissions slow-roasting the planet has already unleashed a crescendo of deadly heat waves, water shortages and superstorms made more destructive by rising seas.

The Bahamas was devastated this month by one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record.

Earth's average surface temperature has gone up 1C since the late 19th century, and is on track -- at current rates of CO2 emissions -- to warm another two or three degrees by century's end.

The 2015 Paris Agreement calls for capping global warming at ""well below"" 2C, and 1.5C if possible.

The report's $1.8 trillion adaptation price tag for the period 2020-2030 is not an estimate of global needs, covering only warning systems and the four other areas identified.

The $7.1 trillion dividend is based on the World Bank calculation that the value of damage caused by climate change is increasing, averaged across the globe, at about 1.5 percent per year.

714,"The Arctic is predicted to warm faster than anywhere else in the world this century, perhaps by as much as 7°C. These rising temperatures threaten one of the largest long-term stores of carbon on land: permafrost.

Permafrost is permanently frozen soil. The generally cold temperatures in the Arctic keep soils there frozen year-on-year. Plants grow in the uppermost soil layers during the short summers and then decay into soil, which freezes when the winter snow arrives.

Over thousands of years, carbon has built up in these frozen soils, and they’re now estimated to contain twice the carbon currently in the atmosphere. Some of this carbon is more than 50,000 years old, which means the plants that decomposed to produce that soil grew over 50,000 years ago. These soil deposits are known as “Yedoma”, which are mainly found in the East Siberian Arctic, but also in parts of Alaska and Canada.

As the region warms, the permafrost is thawing, and this frozen carbon is being released to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane. Methane release is particularly worrying, as it’s a highly potent greenhouse gas.

But a recent study suggested that the release of methane from ancient carbon sources – sometimes referred to as the Arctic methane “bomb” – didn’t contribute much to the warming that occurred during the last deglaciation – the period after the last ice age. This occurred 18,000 to 8,000 years ago, a period that climate scientists study intently, as it’s the last time global temperatures rose by 4°C, which is roughly what is predicted for the world by 2100.

This study suggested to many that ancient methane emissions are not something we should be worried about this century. But in new research, we found that this optimism may be misplaced.

Read more: The Arctic is turning brown because of weird weather – and it could accelerate climate change

We went to the East Siberian Arctic to compare the age of different forms of carbon found in the ponds, rivers and lakes. These waters thaw during the summer and leak greenhouse gases from the surrounding permafrost. We measured the age of the carbon dioxide, methane and organic matter found in these waters using radiocarbon dating and found that most of the carbon released to the atmosphere was overwhelmingly “young”. Where there was intense permafrost thaw, we found that the oldest methane was 4,800 years old, and the oldest carbon dioxide was 6,000 years old. But over this vast Arctic landscape, the carbon released was mainly from young plant organic matter.

This means that the carbon produced by plants growing during each summer growing season is rapidly released over the next few summers. This rapid turnover releases much more carbon than the thaw of older permafrost, even where severe thaw is occurring.

So what does this mean for future climate change? It means that carbon emissions from a warming Arctic may not be driven by the thawing of an ancient frozen carbon bomb, as it’s often described. Instead, most emissions may be relatively new carbon that is produced by plants that grew fairly recently.

What this shows is that the age of the carbon released from the warming Arctic is less important than the amount and form it takes. Methane is 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas over a 100-year timeframe. The East Siberian Arctic is a generally flat and wet landscape, and these are conditions which produce lots of methane, as there’s less oxygen in soils which might otherwise create carbon dioxide during thaws instead. As a result, potent methane could well dominate the greenhouse gas emissions from the region.

Since most of the emissions from the Arctic this century will likely be from “young” carbon, we may not need to worry about ancient permafrost adding substantially to modern climate change. But the Arctic will still be a huge source of carbon emissions, as carbon that was soil or plant matter only a few hundred years ago leaches to the atmosphere. That will increase as warmer temperatures lengthen growing seasons in the Arctic summer.

The fading spectre of an ancient methane time bomb is cold comfort. The new research should urge the world to act boldly on climate change, to limit how much natural processes in the Arctic can contribute to the problem.",mainstream,M08c43,climate.change
917,"Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg on Tuesday slammed global inaction on climate change in front of the world’s top business leaders, as the annual Davos forum faced up to the perils of global warming while bracing for an address from US President Donald Trump.

The 50th meeting of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps resort got under way seeking to meet head-on the dangers to both the environment and economy from the heating of the planet.

Trump, who has repeatedly expressed scepticism about climate change, is set to give the first keynote address of Davos 2020 on Tuesday morning, on the same day as his impeachment trial opens at the Senate in Washington.

But before his appearance, Thunberg underlined the message that has inspired millions around the world—that governments are failing to wake up to the reality of climate change.

“We are all fighting for the environment and climate. If you see it from a bigger perspective, basically nothing has been done. It will require much more than this. This is just the very beginning,” she said.

Speaking calmly and with a wry smile, Thunberg acknowledged that her campaign which began with school strikes had attracted huge attention without yet achieving change.

“There is a difference between being heard to actually leading to something,” she said.

“I am not the person who should complain about not being heard,” she said to appreciative laughter.

“I am being heard all the time. But the science and the voice of the young people are not at the centre of the conversation,” she added.

The forum’s own Global Risks report published last week warned that “climate change is striking harder and more rapidly than many expected” with global temperatures on track to increase by at least three degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) towards the end of the century.

There are no expectations that Trump and Thunberg, who have exchanged barbs through Twitter, will actually meet, but the crowded venue and intense schedule mean a chance encounter cannot be ruled out.

When Trump and his entourage walked through UN headquarters last year at the annual General Assembly, a photo of the teenager staring in apparent fury at the president from the sidelines went viral.

Tweeting as he headed to Davos, Trump appeared in bullish mood, writing he would “bring Good Policy and additional Hundreds of Billions of Dollars back to the United States of America!”

“We are now NUMBER ONE in the Universe, by FAR!! he added.

Sustainability is the buzzword at the forum, which began in 1971, with heel crampons handed out to participants to encourage them to walk on the icy streets rather than use cars, and the signage paint made out of seaweed.

Trump’s opposition to renewable energy, his withdrawal from the Paris climate accord negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and the free hand extended to the fossil fuel industry puts him at odds with the entire thrust of the event.

Business leaders attending the forum will be keen to tout their awareness on climate change but are likely also to be concerned by the state of the global economy whose prospects, according to the IMF, have improved but remain brittle.

The IMF cut its global growth estimate for 2020 to 3.3 percent, saying that a recent truce in the trade war between China and the US had brought some stability but that risks remained.

“We are already seeing some tentative signs of stabilisation but we have not reached a turning point yet,” said IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva.

Activists meanwhile will be pressing for much more concrete action to fight inequality, after Oxfam issued a report outlining how the number of billionaires has doubled in the past decade and the world’s 22 richest men now have more wealth than all the women in Africa.

Greenpeace meanwhile complained that some of the world’s biggest banks, insurers and pension funds have collectively invested $1.4 trillion in fossil fuel companies since the Paris climate deal.

Other key priorities will be exploring how to battle biodiversity loss, narrow the digital divide between the internet haves and have nots and step up the fight against pandemics in the face of vaccine hesitancy and drug resistance.

1112,"Mainstream Scientist Exposes the Dangerous Reality of Chemtrails and Geoengineering

Over the past few years, the issue of geoengineering has been popularized. Mainstream media, academia, and government almost unanimously support the idea of geoengineering as a perceived solution to climate change while suppressing the evidence that it has actually been in use for some time without our consent. On the other hand, there is a growing number of people who are slowly beginning to understand the reality surrounding chemtrail geoengineering, and opposition is slowly growing.

In a bold move against the establishment, Kate Marvel, a mainstream scientist who specializes in “climate change,” spoke out at a Ted Talk against the onset of climate engineering with chemtrails, also known as Solar Radiation Management or “SRM.”

Firstly, computer theorist and founding partner of tech company Applied Invention, Danny Hillis, came on stage and proposed a number of geoengineering concepts which could theoretically, “turn down the temperature of the earth.” These included sending giant parasols into space, putting fizzy water into the ocean, and sending chalk into the atmosphere at a rate of 10 teragrams per year to reflect sunlight and in theory slow the effects of climate change.

Now enters Kate Marvel with the opening line, “Danny, you seem so nice, and I hope we can be friends, and you terrify me.”

Marvel also noted that atmospheric spraying would not do anything to effect other environmental problems such as ocean acidification.

GeoEngineering refers to technologies which are used with the intention of interfering with the earth’s atmosphere in order to alter temperatures and climate. Most of these technologies are still in theoretical stages, however a growing body of evidence suggests that some weather modification technologies such as aerosol spraying or “cloud seeding” have been in production for many decades. Almost no studies have been done which assess the effect that cloud seeding has on environmental safety or human health, which shows that the government has been using untested technologies on the population without our consent.

In 2016, CIA Director John O. Brennan spoke at a Council on Foreign Relations conference about the benefits of geoengineering. However, any mention of potential negative impacts as a result of cloud seeding was conveniently left out.

Although we are all hearing from establishment figures like Brennan that climate engineering is a new technology which we all have the option to accept or decline before it is implemented, that is simply not the case. Evidence going as far back as the early 1920’s shows a push to develop the technology needed to control the weather and has been implemented in some form since at least the 1970’s. This information has been uncovered in various forms, one of those being patents which range from April 27th of 1920 to May of 2003 showing interest in the development of various forms of weather modification technologies. Documents have also been uncovered which show government involvement in SRM since 1947.

Climate Change Alarmism Opens The Door To Reactionary Solutions Such As SRM

The geoengineering debate can be summed up in three words: “Problem, Reaction, Solution.” First, the dire problem of Climate Change is presented by figures like Al Gore, then a reaction is generated from the public in the form of “Climate Can’t Wait!” slogans and public unrest, then the solution of GeoEngineering is presented which gives more power to the powerful and hurts the people in the form of environmental degradation and potential health implications which the document from earlier lists as:

“1. Cloud seeding has been responsible for the great 5-year drought in the Northeast United States.

 2. Isolated sections in the Northeast have experienced 18 years of drought due to cloud seeding.

 3. Weather disturbances in the South Atlantic [sic] have been eliminated and has reduced [sic] the east coast’s rainfall by 30 percent – rain that is needed if agriculture is to be successful.

 4. The average dairy farmer on the east coast, living in an area of cloud seeding, has averaged a net financial loss because of cloud seeding.

 5. Crop production losses in Franklin County, Pa., alone have amounted to $50 Million.

 6. When effects of seeding wear off, cloudbursts occur, causing floods, destroying crops, buildings, and drowning people as well as livestock.

 7. Seeding has been responsible for the serious air pollution problems.

 8. Mental retardation and insanity are traceable to cloud seeding chemicals.

 9. Poisoning of all living matter is directly related to cloud seeding.

 10. Emphysema is three times higher in areas of heavy cloud seeding.

 11. Cancer is virulently out of proportion.

 12. Financial losses to agriculture and related industries run into the billions.

 13. Forest trees as well as cultivated orchards are dying from chemical reactions taking place in the air due to the addition of cloud seeding agents.”



We often hear predictions surrounding climate change by so-called “experts” like Al Gore who claimed that the Arctic would become “ice-free” by 2013. Ironically, in 2016 a global warming expedition to the Arctic was forced to turn around due to record ice.

There are real solutions to environmental problems which don’t end up harming us or the environment further. It is time for people to stand up for themselves and reject dangerous and untested technologies like these.

Less visible trash would make Dominica look cleaner, and a pristine Caribbean island is a place where tourists want to visit and spend money.

“It would be very simplistic to say this is just about building back,” says Bardouille.

“I think there’s a serious underestimation of the amount of trauma and post-traumatic stress, and the impact it had on the fabric of our society. We have to now look at the economic strength of our nation,” she says.

654,"Global warming, fueled by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, is as real as a Texas-sized drought. While the planet’s temperature has increased just 1 degree Fahrenheit (.55 degrees Celsius) during the past century, Earth’s coldest regions have warmed significantly more. As a result, many plant and animal species are on the verge of extinction. Blizzards, floods and hurricanes have become more devastating. Ice is melting, oceans are rising, glaciers are tumbling and the weather has fluctuated wildly from balmy winters to brisk summers.

As Earth’s CO2 levels increase, so will the temperature, some 10 degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century. In fact, global temperatures are rising faster than at any other time in the past 1,000 years.

506,"Leigh Van Valen and Bob Sloan offered a more complex theory. During the Late Cretaceous, the continents were moving and major new mountain chains began to rise. Many of the shallow Mesozoic seas dried up. Van Valen and Sloan suggest that this caused the world's climate to change. Evidence from fossil plants at their Montana study site suggests that it got about ten centigrade points colder in the Late Cretaceous. A temperature decline that large would affect the earth. It would have become colder in the mountains, and new plants would have replaced the warm-weather plants.

Van Valen and Sloan have argued that dinosaurs were at a disadvantage in the new forests of coniferous trees. So, they left the mountains and moved toward the tropics, to a better climate. This theory suggests that the dinosaurs survived longer in the tropics than in the mountains. Because plants in the tropics survived, something else must have caused dinosaur extinction in these areas.

One suggestion is that placental mammals (mammals that give live birth and have a placenta) became abundant in the mountains, because they no longer competed with dinosaurs. Later, the mammals escaped these regions and went into the tropics, where they drove dinosaurs to extinction. There are problems with this theory. Some studies of foraminifera (the shells of protozoans talked about earlier) show that there was a short-term warming trend in the Late Cretaceous. But they are right about the long-term cooling trend. There is no evidence that dinosaurs lasted longer in one area than another. Although competition between animals may explain the extinction of many living things at the end of the Cretaceous, other groups, especially the foraminifera, seem to have disappeared without competitors.

Another climate change theory is due to recent research. Some living reptiles, turtles and crocodiles, lay eggs. It was recently found that the sex of their offspring is decided by the temperature of the nest. So if the same were true for dinosaurs, cooling temperatures in the Late Cretaceous may have caused all the young to be of the same sex, so the species would not have been able to continue.",mainstream,M106c6,climate.change

• Reid R. Frazier is an energy reporter for The Allegheny Front, a Pittsburgh-based public media outlet covering the environment in Pennsylvania. His work has aired on NPR and Marketplace.

If you’ve been following climate change, the coronavirus pandemic will feel oddly familiar these days. Countries, including the U.S., have implemented radical policies that would have been unthinkable a few weeks ago to slow the spread of the virus. Is this what it will take to solve the climate crisis?

On the latest episode of our Trump on Earth podcast, one climate reporter and writer says the coronavirus pandemic can’t be separated from the coming climate crisis. Last year Emily Atkin launched the HEATED newsletter which, in her words, is for people who are pissed off about climate change.

Atkin has now turned Heated into a podcast series about the intersection of climate change and coronavirus. It’s running on the podcast feed for Drilled (another climate-related podcast you should be listening to). She spoke with one of the Trump on Earth podcast host, The Allegheny Front’s Reid Frazier.

Reid Frazier: Tell me about the podcast series and why you decided to do it.

Emily Atkin: I was sitting here watching this global crisis take over society, politics and our lives. And I was confused about how I should be approaching it as a climate journalist. I knew there were clear parallels: It’s a problem that threatens millions of lives across the world. Scientists are telling us to act very rapidly and quickly, and yet we’re not doing that. I wanted to talk to really smart people about that. I figured I might as well record [those conversations] and make it available for other people to listen to so that we could all figure it out together.

RF: If you’ve followed climate change you know that this is a massive problem that requires collective action on an unprecedented scale. There’s a lot of resistance built-in; resistance to changing our behaviors and our systems. How do you see those problems as similar? Do you see big differences in how these problems manifest themselves or how they need to be looked at?

EA: I think the differences are good to get out of the way first. Coronavirus is obviously hugely different in that it is much faster and the impacts to human life are much more urgent. I think we’re all going to see people close to us either financially affected or affected in their health. This is touching every aspect of our lives very obviously right now, whereas climate change is touching every aspect of our life right now, too, but it’s a little less obvious day-to-day.

The other thing is that with coronavirus, we don’t have as big of an industry whose whole livelihood depends on the crisis keeping going. The pharmaceutical industry will be fine coronavirus or not. The fossil fuel industry will not be fine if we solve climate change because there will be no fossil fuel industry.

But the big similarities here are that climate change is a problem that won’t be solved unless we take really radical action very quickly on a global scale. It can’t be done without the biggest nations on Earth. It’s a problem where millions of lives are threatened; not only lives, but society in general. It’s a problem where we have to listen to scientists. There are no compromises based on biology or physics. Carbon dioxide warms the atmosphere. If we want the atmosphere to stop warming, we need to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide. Just the same, coronavirus is a virus that attacks ourselves and that’s why we need to stay away from each other. It’s basic science and physics.

There are also some social similarities: a reluctance to admit to the scale of the problem as we know it. I think we saw that with coronavirus, where we all knew it was happening, but we were like, ‘but it’s not going to affect me and I don’t really have to do anything.’ Coronavirus is basically just climate change sped up 10 times over. It’s like climate change on steroids.

RF: As you mentioned, there’s this resistance to listening to what the scientists are telling us. With climate change, you can basically get away with that for years. That is that the terrible thing about climate change –the ramifications of our actions (or inaction won’t be felt until the next generation. But, with coronavirus, it’s like three weeks.

EA: There’s plausible deniability, too. When it comes to climate change, deaths are happening now. Someone you love could be really affected by a hurricane or drought or a flooding event or heatwave. But there’s some part of your brain that you could compartmentalize and say that it wasn’t climate change. It’s not like coronavirus where if they die from coronavirus, they die from coronavirus.

I think that’s an important distinction to make when we’re talking about who is going to be affected by climate change. It’s not that people are going to see the effects down the line; it’s that people are going to start admitting to themselves that these are the effects down the line.

We’ve all focused our attention on this one thing. But climate change hasn’t stopped. It’s still happening and our efforts to combat it have just slowed. The fossil fuel industry is trying to take advantage of the crisis and make sure they can survive when this is done. These are all things that we need to keep in mind as we’re self-isolating and trying to deal with this crisis. It’s not that we’ve replaced one crisis for the other, it’s that now we have two to deal with.

RF: There’s been an effort from environmental groups and some in the Democratic Party to infuse any recovery package with green policies, almost like to kickstart a Green New Deal. What have you made of the debate about whether any recovery package should incentivize decarbonization or ramp up renewables?

EA: It doesn’t seem unrelated to me. If society were gonna go where we wanted it to go anyway, which is where we don’t die from four degrees Celsius of warming, we need a mass investment in green jobs. That’s not just renewable energy jobs, that’s things like planting mangrove trees and restoring ecosystems. So if we’re going to put two trillion dollars in revitalizing the economy, why not create an economy that is more resilient to global threats, especially as we’re facing a global threat?

Also, if we had the opportunity to spend trillions of dollars revitalizing the economy and in the process could not only save millions of lives from coronavirus, but could save millions of lives from climate change, creating a better society that’s more sustainable, why wouldn’t we do that?

RF: I think for a lot of people, we’re just not used to government telling us things that we can and can’t do in this country–closing restaurants, telling people to stay home–all these things that a month ago would have been unthinkable.

Do you see a shift in the way we see government or the things that become allowable because of this crisis? I mean, if we’re straight up just giving Americans twelve hundred dollars to just survive and giving industries hundreds of billions of dollars to survive, will a Green New Deal, or something like it, become more politically acceptable?

EA: Americans’ ability to forget things that have happened and keep up with the status quo is very strong. However, what I would hope comes out of this situation in terms of changing our way of thinking is that we understand the difference between sacrifices you make while you still have time to prevent a problem and sacrifices you make when you were in the thick of a problem.

If we’re going to solve climate change, we will have to make sacrifices. The policies that we put in place now to prevent crises later are going to mean that some things are going to be weird and uncomfortable and take getting used to it. It’s going to radically change the costs of certain foods, how much we use public transportation, how much our taxes are. It’s going to be uncomfortable and it’s gonna suck, but it’s way less uncomfortable than the changes that climate change would force us to make in the moment.

I’ve been covering climate science for long enough to know that if we reach three degrees Celsius, the world is going to look awful. The things that we’re going to have to do to try and reverse that in real-time are not going to be pretty. So let’s make these sacrifices now so that we all have a better chance of survival when we’re a little bit down the line.",mainstream,M08c78,climate.change
626,"Seems that beauty product ads are becoming important mediums to push mind control/illuminati symbolism. The short video advertisement for Rihanna’s perfume Reb’l Fleur is crammed with mind control triggers and monarch programming symbolism.

Rihanna is first shown lying inside a flower, representing purity and innocence. She is then walks towards a mirror reflecting herself dressed in black – representing her “bad side” and her alter persona.

While she is going through the “looking glass” (reference to Alice in Wonderland), we see written “Bad Feels so Good”.

In mind control, slaves are encouraged to embrace their bad side (their alter persona) as it is the only way to be relieved from their trauma/torture. So, yes, it feels bad to be good.

Once through the looking glass, Rihanna is shown walking through a maze surrounded by fractured mirrors.

Labyrinths and fractured mirrors are mind control triggers representing the internal world of mind control victims: false reality, illusion and confusion. Only the handler, represented by the men in black, hold the key to their psyche.

Rihanna’s handlers are literally in her head, watching her going through the maze. They then take a hold of her.

Rihanna blinded by her three handlers

The scene becomes oddly sexual as Rihanna holds the phallic-shaped perfume bottle while she is blinded by her handlers. This refers to the sexually abusive relationship between mind control slaves and their handlers.

The entire ad then plays in reverse, another allusion to the reversal of good and bad. As she goes through the looking glass again, we see “Good Feels so Bad”.",conspiracy,C017bd,climate.change; coronavirus; mind.control
701,"Anthropogenic climate change is already a reality in Africa, as it is elsewhere in the world. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Africa is among the most vulnerable continents to climate change.[1][2] The vulnerability of Africa to climate change is driven by a range of factors that includes weak adaptive capacity, high dependence on ecosystem goods for livelihoods, and less developed agricultural production systems.[3] The risks of climate change on agricultural production, food security, water resources and ecosystem services will likely have increasingly severe consequences on lives and sustainable development prospects in Africa.[4] Managing this risk requires integration of mitigation and adaptation strategies in the management of ecosystem goods and services, and the agriculture production systems in Africa.[5]

Over the coming decades, warming from climate change is expected across almost all the earth's surface, and global mean rainfall will increase.[6] Regional effects on rainfall in the tropics are expected to be much more spatially variable and the sign of change at any one location is often less certain, although changes are expected. Consistent with this, observed surface temperatures have generally increased over Africa since the late 19th century to the early 21st century by about 1 °C, but locally as much as 3 °C for minimum temperature in the Sahel at the end of the dry season.[7] Observed precipitation trends indicate spatial and temporal discrepancies as expected.[8][2] The observed changes in temperature and precipitation vary regionally.[9][8]

In terms of adaptation efforts, regional-level actors are making some progress. This includes the development and adoption of several regional climate change adaptation strategies[10] e.g. SADC Policy Paper Climate Change,[11] and the adaptation strategy for the water sector.[12] In addition, there has been other efforts to enhance climate change adaptation, such as the tripatite Programme on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation in Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA-EAC-SADC).[13]

As a supranational organisation of 55 member states, the African Union has put forward 47 goals and corresponding actions in a 2014 draft report[14] to combat and mitigate climate change on the continent. The Secretary General of the United Nations has also declared a need for close cooperation with the African Union in order to tackle climate change, in accordance with the UN's sustainable development goals.

Climate change will increasingly impact Africa due to many factors. These impacts are already being felt and will increase in magnitude if action is not taken to reduce global carbon emissions. The impacts include higher temperatures, drought, changing rainfall patterns and increased climate variability. These conditions have a bearing on energy production and consumption. The recent drought in many African countries, which has been linked to climate change, adversely affected both energy security and economic growth across the continent.

Agriculture is inherently sensitive to climate conditions and is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the risks and impacts of global climate change.[17] Agriculture in most African countries is mainly small-scale and rain-fed, making it particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change. Observed and projected disruptions in precipitation patterns due to climate change are likely to shorten growing seasons and affect crop yield in many parts of Africa. Furthermore, the agriculture sector in Africa is dominated by smallholder farmers with limited access to technology and the resources to adapt.[18]

Climate variability and change have been and continue to be, the principal source of fluctuations in global food production in countries of the developing world where production is highly rain-dependent.[19] The agriculture sector is sensitive to climate variability,[20] especially the inter-annual variability of precipitation, temperature patterns, and extreme weather events (droughts and floods). These climatic events are predicted to increase in the future and are expected to have significant consequences to the agriculture sector.[21] This would have a negative influence on food prices, food security, and land-use decisions.[22] Yields from rainfed agriculture in some African countries could be reduced by up to 50% by 2020.[21] In order to prevent the future destructive impact of climate variability on food production, it is crucial to adjust or suggest possible policies to cope with increased climate variability. African countries need to build a national legal framework to manage food resources in accordance with the anticipated climate variability. However, before devising a policy to cope with the impacts of climate variability, especially to the agriculture sector, it is critical to have a clear understanding of how climate variability affects different food crops.

In the year 2020, sever invasion of Locusts harmed the agriculture in eastern Africa. The invasion is at least partly due to climate change - the warmer temperature and heavier rainfall caused an abnormal increase in the number of locusts[23]

Water quality and availability have deteriorated in most areas of Africa particularly due to climate change. Previous research and climate projections provide enough evidence that water resources are vulnerable and have the possibility of being strongly impacted by climate change with vast ramifications on human societies.[24] The IPCC predicts millions of people in Africa will persistently face increased water stress due to climate variability and change (IPCC 2013). Changes in precipitation patterns directly affect surface runoff and water availability.[25] Any changes to the hydrological cycle may have significant effects on river basins of Africa. To improve understanding of past and future changes in water availability due to climate change, the IPCC (IPCC 2013) recommends using the dynamic downscaling technique. The IPCC 2013 proposed using the coordinated regional downscaling experiment (CORDEX) regional climate models which runs at a maximum of 50 km resolutions, the resolution used depends upon the size of the watershed and area coverage by the meteorological records. However, before using the climate simulations from the dynamic downscaling, it is appropriate to evaluate their performance at different spatial scales since their performance differs from one location to another and from one RCM to another.

African countries have the least efficient public health systems in the world.[26] Infectious disease burdens such as malaria, schistosomiasis, dengue fever, meningitis, which are sensitive to climate impacts, are highest in the sub-Saharan African region. For instance, over 90 percent of annual global malaria cases are in Africa.[26] Changes in climate will affect the spread of infectious agents as well as alter people’s disposition to these infections.

With increasing population and corresponding energy demand, energy security must be addressed because energy is crucial for sustainable development. Climate change has affected energy sectors in Africa as many countries depend on hydropower generation. Decreasing rainfall levels and droughts have resulted in lower water levels in dams with adverse impacts on hydropower generation. This has resulted in low electrical energy production, high cost of electricity and power outages or load-shedding in some African countries that depend on hydroelectric power generation. Disruptions in hydropower generation have negatively affected various sectors in countries such as Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania.

Central Africa, for the most part, is landlocked and is geographically threatened by climate change. Due to its high climate variability and rainfed agriculture, Central Africa is expected to experience longer and more frequent heatwaves as well as an increase in wet extremes.[27] The global mean temperature in this region is to increase by 1.5 °C to 2 °C.[28]

Angola - ""The objective of the National Adaptation Programs of Action are to identify and communicate the urgent and immediate needs of the country regarding climate change adaptation, to increase Angola‘s resilience to climate variabilities and to climate change to ensure achievement of Poverty reduction programs, sustainable development objectives and the Millennium Development Goals pursued by the Government.""[29]

The carbon dioxide-absorbing capacity of forests in the Congo Basin have decreased. This decrease has occurred due to increasing heat and drought causing decreased tree growth. This suggests that even unlogged forests are being affected by climate change. A Nature study indicates that by 2030, the African jungle will absorb 14 percent less carbon dioxide than it did from around 2005-2010, and will absorb none at all by 2035.[30]

Situated almost entirely in the tropics, rainfall in Eastern Africa is dominated by the seasonal migration of the tropical-rain band.[31] Eastern Africa is characterized by high spatio-temporal rainfall variability as it spans over 30 degrees of latitude (across the equator). It has influences from both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, and has major orographic features (highlands) as well as inland water bodies such as Lake Victoria. Therefore the rainfall seasonality varies from a single wet season per year in July–August in parts of the northwest (including Ethiopia and South Sudan, which are meteorologically more connected to West Africa, with the West African monsoon bringing the rains) to a single wet season per year in December - February in the south (over Tanzania), with many areas close to the equator having two rainy seasons per year,[32] approximately in March–May (the “Long Rains”) and October to December (the “Short Rains”). Fine-scale variability in rainfall seasonality is often linked to orography and lakes. Inter-annual variability can be large and known controls include variations in Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of different ocean basins, large-scale atmospheric modes of variability such as the Madden-Julian Osciliation (MJO) [33][34] and tropical cyclones.[34][35]

Eastern Africa has witnessed frequent and severe droughts in recent decades, as well as devastating floods. Trends in rainfall since the 1980s show a general decrease in March - May (MAM) seasonal rains with a slight increase during June - September (JJAS) and October - December (OND) rains,[36] although there appears to have been a recent recovery in the MAM rains.[37] In the future, both rainfall and temperature are projected to change over Eastern Africa.[38][39][40] Recent studies on climate projections suggest that average temperature might increase by about 2-3 °C by the middle of the century and 2-5 °C at the end of the century.[41] This will depend on emission scenarios as well as on how the real climate responds compared with the range of possible outcomes shown by models. Climate model projections tend to show an increase in rainfall, particularly during OND season, which is also projected to occur later. This delay in the short rain season, has been linked to the deepening of the Saharan Heat Low under climate change.[42] It should be noted, however that some models predict decreasing rainfall,[40][41] and for some regions and seasons the very largest rainfall increases predicted have been shown to involve implausible mechanisms due to systematic model errors.[43] In addition, changes of aerosols provide a forcing of rainfall change that is not captured in many assessments of climate projections.[44][45]

The contrast of the drying trend of MAM (long rains) rainfall in equatorial Eastern Africa, with most models predicting a wetting in the future has been labelled the “East African climate change paradox,""[45] although there has been some recent recovery in the rainfall.[37] Studies have shown that the drying trend is unlikely to be purely natural, but may be driven by factors such as aerosols rather than greenhouse gases,[45] further research is needed. The drying has been shown to be have been caused by a shorter rainy season, and linked to deepening of the Arabian Heat Low.[37]

Consistent with the uncertainty in rainfall projections, changes in rainy seasons onset are uncertain in equatorial Eastern Africa, although many models predict a later and wetter short rains.[42] The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is known to provide a strong control on inter-annual variability in the short rains,[46] and studies show that extreme IODs may increase under climate change.[47]

Globally, climate change is expected to lead to intensification of rainfall, as extreme rainfall increases at a faster rate with warming than total rainfall does.[6] Recent work shows that across Africa global models are expected to under-estimate the rate of change of this rainfall intensification,[48] and changes in rainfall extremes may be much more widespread than those predicted by global models.[49]

Southern parts of Eastern Africa receive most of their rainfall in a single rainy season during the southern hemisphere’s winter: over Tanzania seasonal rainfall is projected to increase under future climate change, although there is uncertainty.[42] Further south, over Mozambique, a shorter season due to a later onset is projected under future climate change, again with some uncertainty.[50]

Rwanda has developed the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA 2006) which contains information to guide national policy-makers and planners on priority vulnerabilities and adaptations in important economic sectors.[56] The country has also developed sector based policies on adaptation to climate change such as the Vision 2020, the National Environmental Policy and the Agricultural Policy among others.[57]

Tanzania Tanzania has outlined priority adaptation measures in their NAPA, and various national sector strategies and research outputs.[58] The NAPA has been successful at encouraging climate change mainstreaming into sector policies in Tanzania; however, the cross-sectoral collaboration crucial to implementing adaptation strategies remains limited due to institutional challenges such as power imbalances, budget constraints and an ingrained sectoral approach.[59] Most of the projects in Tanzania concern agriculture and water resource management (irrigation, water saving, rainwater collection); however, energy and tourism also play an important role.[60]

The West African region can be divided into four climatic sub-regions namely the Guinea Coast, Soudano-Sahel, Sahel (extending eastward to the Ethiopian border) and the Sahara,[66] each with different climatic conditions. The seasonal cycle of rainfall is mainly driven by the south-north movement of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which is characterised by the confluence between moist southwesterly monsoon winds and the dry northeasterly Harmattan.[67]

Based on the inter-annual rainfall variability, three main climatic periods have been observed over the Sahel: the wet period from 1950 to the early 1960s followed by a dry period from 1972 to 1990 and then the period from 1991 onwards which has seen a partial rainfall recovery.[68][69][70] During the dry period, the Sahel experienced a number of particularly severe drought events, with devastating effects.[71][72] The recent decades, have also witnessed a moderate increment in annual rainfall since the beginning of 1990s. However, total annual rainfall remains significantly below that observed during the 1950s.[73][71]

Some have identified the recent 2 decades as a recovery period.[74] Others refer to this as a period of ‘hydrological intensification’ with much of the annual rainfall increase coming from more severe rain events and sometimes flooding rather than more frequent rainfall, or similarly other works [75][76] underline the continuity of the drought even though the rainfall has increased. Since 1985, 54 percent of the population has been affected by five or more floods in the 17 Sahel region countries.[77] In 2012, severe drought conditions in the Sahel were reported. Governments in the region responded quickly, launching strategies to address the issue.[78]

The region is projected to experience changes in rainfall regime, with climate models suggesting that decreases in wet season rainfall are more likely in the western Sahel, and increases more likely in the central to east Sahel, although opposite trends cannot yet be ruled out.[79][80][81] These trends will affect the frequency and severity of floods, droughts, desertification, sand and dust storms, desert locust plagues and water shortages.[82][83]

However, irrespective of the changes in seasonal mean rain, the most intense storms are expected to become more intense, amplifying flood frequency.[84][85] Enhanced carbon emissions and global warming may also lead to an increase in dry spells especially across the Guinea Coast associated with a reduction of the wet spells under both 1.5℃ and 2℃ global warming level.[86]

Fifteen percent of Sahel region population has also experienced a temperature increase of more than 1 °C from 1970 to 2010. The Sahel region, in particular, will experience higher average temperatures over the course of the 21st century and changes in rainfall patterns, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Climate change, and resulting in increased temperatures, storms, droughts, and rising sea levels, will affect the incidence and distribution of infectious disease across the globe.[87] This is true in Africa, where malaria continues to have dramatic effects on the population. As climate change continues, the specific areas likely to experience the year-round, high-risk transmission of malaria will shift from coastal West Africa to an area between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, known as the African Highlands.[88]

To understand the exposures that affect shifting malaria transmission rates we can look to The Epidemiologic Triad, a model that explains the relationship between exposure, transmission, and causation of infectious diseases.[89] With regards to malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands, factors and exposures resulting from drastic environmental changes like warmer climates, shifts in weather patterns, and increases in human impact such as deforestation, provide appropriate conditions for malaria transmission between carrier and host.[90] Because of this, vectors will adapt, thrive, and multiply at a fast pace. An increase in the number of vectors that carry parasites, microbes, and pathogens that cause disease will become a health hazard for the human population.[87] Specifically, malaria is caused by the Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasites which are carried by the vector Anopheles mosquito. Even though the Plasmodium vivax parasite can survive in lower temperatures, the Plasmodium falciparum parasite will only survive and replicate in the mosquito when climate temperatures are above 20℃.[91] Increases in humidity and rain also contribute to the replication and survival of this infectious agent.,[92] Increasing global temperatures combined with changes in land cover as a result of extreme deforestation will create ideal habitats for mosquitoes to survive in the African Highlands. If deforestation continues at its current rate, more land will be available for mosquito breeding grounds, and the population of mosquitos will rapidly increase. The increase in mosquitoes will thus increase the opportunity for both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasites to proliferate.

Exposure to malaria will become a greater risk to humans as the number of female Anopheles mosquitos infected with either the Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax parasite increases.[92] The mosquito will transmit the parasite to the human host through a bite, resulting in infection. Then, when an uninfected mosquito bites the now infected human host, the parasite will be transmitted to the mosquitoes which will then become an exposure to other uninfected human hosts. Individuals who are constantly exposed to the Malaria parasite due to multiple bites by mosquitoes that carry the parasite are at greater risk of dying.[91] Infected humans can also transmit the disease to uninfected or healthy humans via contaminated blood.[91]

The health effects caused by shifts in malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands have the potential to be severe. Research has shown that the effects of climate change on health will impact most populations over the next few decades.[93] However, Africa, and specifically the African Highlands, are susceptible to being particularly negatively affected. In 2010, 91% of the global burden due to malaria deaths occurred in Africa. Several spatiotemporal models have been studied to assess the potential effect of projected climate scenarios on malaria transmission in Africa. A study conducted by Caminade et al.[94] concluded that the most significant climate change effects are confined to specific regions, including the African Highlands. These results are consistent with previous studies.

Ultimately, studies show an overall increase in climate suitability for malaria transmission resulting in an increase in the population at risk of contracting the disease.[94] Of significant importance is the increase of epidemic potential at higher altitudes (like the African Highlands). Rising temperatures in these areas have the potential to change normally non-malarial areas to areas with seasonal epidemics.[95] Consequently, new populations will be exposed to the disease resulting in healthy years lost. In addition, the disease burden may be more detrimental to areas that lack the ability and resources to effectively respond to such challenges and stresses.[96]

Scientific limitations when examining shifting malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands are similar to those related to broader understandings of climate change and malaria. While modeling with temperature changes shows that there is a relationship between an increase in temperature and an increase in malaria transmission, limitations still exist. Future population shifts that affect population density, as well as changes in the behavior of mosquitos, can affect transmission rates and are limiting factors in determining the future risk of malaria outbreaks, which also affect planning for correct outbreak response preparation.[88]

The challenges of controlling and possibly eradicating malaria in the African Highlands are many and varied. Many of the strategies used to control malaria have not changed, are few in number and have rarely been added to in the last 20 years.

The most common forms of control are educating the public and vector control. The huge geographic area of the vectors Anopheles is possibly the largest challenge faced in the control of malaria. With such a large area to cover it is hard to use insecticides at a continuous and effective level.[97] This form of control is expensive, and the areas affected are not able to sustain control. Without sustained control, a rapid resurgence in parasite transmission is seen. Another challenge with insecticides is that the vector is now becoming insecticide-resistant. Due to the fact that mosquitoes have several generations per year, resistance is seen very quickly.[97]

Education has its limitations as well, as the population most affected by malaria are children, and the educational message is to stay inside during peak mosquito activity. The low socioeconomic status of the people who inhabit the African Highlands is also a challenge. Local health facilities have limited resources, and poor living conditions and malnourishment exacerbate malaria symptoms and increase the likelihood of death due to malaria.[97] As climate change shifts geographic areas of transmission to the African Highlands, the challenge will be to find and control the vector in areas that have not seen it before, and to not waste resources on areas where the temperature is no longer conducive to parasite growth.[98]

The solutions that can help malaria control and possibly lead to eradication are far fewer in number than the challenges, but if they are effective they can truly change the areas currently affected. There are number of groups working on a vaccine, some are looking to control the transmission of the parasite to the host, or control transmission from human back to the vector.[99] These vaccines are not very effective currently, and lose their effectiveness over time, so are not ideal. But, the development is still progressing in the hopes of finding a better, more effective long-lasting vaccine.[99] An alternative to vaccines is vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP) that is a form a gene therapy. This therapy will change cells in the host that will secrete antigens from various stages of the parasite in the hopes of triggering an anamnestic immune response in the recipient and prevent disease and parasite transmission.[100]

The policy implications of climate change and malaria rates in the African Highlands are also vast, and ultimately fall into two categories:
• Enacting policy that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus slowing down climate change, and
• Mitigating problems that have already arisen, and will inevitably continue to develop, due to climate change.[101]

Addressing both of these areas is of great importance, as those in the poorest countries, including countries that make up the African Highlands, face the greatest burden. Additionally, when countries are forced to contend with a disease like malaria, their prospects for economic growth are slowed. This contributes to continued and worsening global inequality.[102]

When addressing policy that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to act on a global scale, even when related effects are narrowed to a smaller area. The 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change made nine recommendations for governments to address. These include:
• Support cities that encourage healthy activities for individuals and the planet.
• Increase access to renewable energy in low to middle-income countries.
• Quantify avoided burdens when these measures are taken.
• Create an agreement that will help counties making changes to become low-carbon economies.[101]

When one focuses on mitigation, specifically as it relates to malaria in the African Highlands, research is still an important component. This research needs to take many forms, including attribution studies, to help clarify the degree to which malaria rates are attributed to climate change; scenario modeling, which can help further our understanding of future climate change consequences on malaria rates; and examinations of intervention programs and techniques, to help our understanding of what appropriate responses are.[102] Surveillance and monitoring of malaria in populations in the African Highlands will also be important, to better understand disease.[101]

Beyond these research priorities, it is also important that we enact policies that will significantly increase investments in public health in the African Highlands. This achieves two goals, the first being better outcomes related to malaria in the affected area, and the second being an overall better health environment for populations.[101] It is also important to focus on “one-health approaches.""[101] This means collaborating on an interdisciplinary level, across various geographic areas, to come up with workable solutions.

These policies can be seen in action in the World Health Organization's “Adaptation to Climate Change in Africa Plan of Action for the Health Sector 2012-2016.""[103] This report “is intended to provide a comprehensive and evidence-based coordinated response of the health sector to climate change adaptation needs of African countries in order to support the commitments and priorities of African governments.""[103] The action plan includes goals like scaling up public health activities, coordinating efforts on an international scale, strengthening partnerships and collaborative efforts, and promoting research on both the effects of climate change as well as effective measures taken in local communities to mitigate climate change consequences.[103]

The video for ‘Like Lightning’ has premiered on the website for Music Declares Emergency, the organisation set up by members of the music world to tackle climate change within the industry. Watch the new video below.

Foals have been very open about their passion for campaigning against climate change. At the Mercury Prize ceremony in September, they held up the Music Declares Emergency banner, which reads: “No music on a dead planet.”

Talking to NME about the gesture in a recent Big Read interview, singer Yannis Philippakis said: “Fay Milton (of Savages) is an old friend and great drummer. I was talking to her about Extinction Rebellion then we signed up to Music Declares Emergency.

“We’d been carbon offsetting before that and we’d been aware of environmental problems. It’s definitely disturbed me for a while, that’s why a lot of the lyrics on these two records pertain to that.”

He continued: “On the day of the Mercury Prize, we thought it would be good to bring exposure to Music Declares and just to get that sentiment across. It’s easy to think, ‘Oh, everyone knows what’s going on with the environment and everyone’s making changes’, but it’s one of those echo chamber things where you forget that actually lots of people either don’t care, don’t believe it or don’t act upon it.”

NME recently spoke to Fay Milton about the organisation and what the music industry can do to combat climate change.

“There’s such a short period of time to make the changes we need to make, and to make people wake up and realise that there isn’t time for everyone to change everything they do,” she said.

“To use Greta Thunberg’s analogy, the house is on fire, and there isn’t time for whoever started the fire with their cigarette to quit smoking before saying the house is on fire – it’s on fire now, and we need to fix this. Let’s change our lifestyles, let’s fly less, let’s use less plastic – but ultimately what’s needed is a governmental response.”

Foals also released a new live film called Rip Up The Road. In an NME review of the film, James McMahon said: “Rip Up The Road is a film where we get the opportunity to understand Foals in a way we’ve never done before.

“Simultaneously it gives the band a canvas to do the same about themselves. It is a film that asks why we love music and why music is made and shows us the men behind the melodies.”",mainstream,M0aa3b,climate.change
1088,"The 2013 EU strategy on adaptation to climate change aims at contributing to a more climate-resilient Europe. However, there are still large gaps in understanding and characterising climate impacts in Europe and how impacts in the rest of the world could affect Europe. This report provides quantitative modelling-based results from biophysical and agro-economic models as part of the PESETA-IV (Projection of Economic impacts of climate change in Sectors of the European Union based on bottom-up Analysis) project. We analyse climate change projections for 2050 considering the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) of 8.5 W/m2 (with corresponding global warming levels ranging between 1.6 oC and 2.7 oC compared to pre-industrial levels), as well as for 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming conditions. Results show that climate change will pose a threat to global food production in the medium to long term, and that Europe will also be affected. Forced by the projected changes in daily temperature, precipitation, wind, relative humidity, and global radiation, grain maize yields in the EU will decline between 1% and 22%. In addition, wheat yields in Southern Europe are expected to decrease by up to 49%. However, in Northern Europe some of the negative productivity effects caused by climate change may be partially offset by higher levels of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and changing precipitation regimes. Losses, especially in Southern Europe may be reduced by tailored adaptation strategies; e.g. changing varieties and crop types, increasing and improving irrigation practices for certain crops and when economically feasible. However, limitations on sustainable water abstraction levels could become a barrier to increase irrigation levels, specifically in the Mediterranean countries (particularly Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Italy and Turkey) where duration of water scarcity under global warming are projected to intensify. As large negative climate change impacts on productivity outside of the EU are estimated, large market spill-over effects will push up production in both Northern and Southern Europe through higher demand for some agricultural commodities outside of EU, resulting in higher producer prices. This, in turn, may benefit farmers' income and have positive effects on the EU’s agricultural commodity exports. However, other limiting factors (not all fully integrated into the used modelling system yet), such as increasing water shortage in Southern Europe (Task 10) and constraints on the expansion of irrigation, increasing impacts of heatwaves and droughts, consequences of reduction of nutrient use due to environmental and climate mitigation constraints, need to be further evaluated.",mainstream,M07577,climate.change
1318,"A highly qualified and experienced climate modeler with impeccable credentials has rejected the unscientific bases of the doom-mongering over a purported climate crisis. His work has not yet been picked up in this country, but that is about to change. Writing at the Australian site Quadrant, Tony Thomas introduces the English-speaking world to the truth-telling of Dr. Mototaka Nakamura (hat tip: Andrew Bolt, John McMahon).

There’s a top-level oceanographer and meteorologist who is prepared to cry “Nonsense!”on the “global warming crisis” evident to climate modellers but not in the real world. He’s as well or better qualified than the modellers he criticises — the ones whose Year 2100 forebodings of 4degC warming have set the world to spending $US1.5 trillion a year to combat CO2 emissions. The iconoclast is Dr. Mototaka Nakamura. In June he put out a small book in Japanese on “the sorry state of climate science”. It’s titled Confessions of a climate scientist: the global warming hypothesis is an unproven hypothesis, and he is very much qualified to take a stand. From 1990 to 2014 he worked on cloud dynamics and forces mixing atmospheric and ocean flows on medium to planetary scales. His bases were MIT (for a Doctor of Science in meteorology), Georgia Institute of Technology, Goddard Space Flight Centre, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Duke and Hawaii Universities and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology. He’s published about 20 climate papers on fluid dynamics. [i] Today’s vast panoply of “global warming science” is like an upside down pyramid built on the work of a few score of serious climate modellers. They claim to have demonstrated human-derived CO2 emissions as the cause of recent global warming and project that warming forward. Every orthodox climate researcher takes such output from the modellers’ black boxes as a given.

Dr. Nakamura has just made his work available to the English-speaking world:

And the critique he offers is comprehensive.

Now Nakamura has found it again, further accusing the orthodox scientists of “data falsification” by adjusting previous temperature data to increase apparent warming “The global surface mean temperature-change data no longer have any scientific value and are nothing except a propaganda tool to the public,” he writes. The climate models are useful tools for academic studies, he says. However, “the models just become useless pieces of junk or worse (worse in a sense that they can produce gravely misleading output) when they are used for climate forecasting.” The reason: These models completely lack some critically important climate processes and feedbacks, and represent some other critically important climate processes and feedbacks in grossly distorted manners to the extent that makes these models totally useless for any meaningful climate prediction. I myself used to use climate simulation models for scientific studies, not for predictions, and learned about their problems and limitations in the process.

Climate forecasting is simply impossible, if only because future changes in solar energy output are unknowable. As to the impacts of human-caused CO2, they can’t be judged “with the knowledge and technology we currently possess.” # A complete lack of meaningful representations of aerosol changes that generate clouds. # Lack of understanding of drivers of ice-albedo (reflectivity) feedbacks: “Without a reasonably accurate representation, it is impossible to make any meaningful predictions of climate variations and changes in the middle and high latitudes and thus the entire planet.” # Arbitrary “tunings” (fudges) of key parameters that are not understood Concerning CO2 changes he says, I want to point out a simple fact that it is impossible to correctly predict even the sense or direction of a change of a system when the prediction tool lacks and/or grossly distorts important non-linear processes, feedbacks in particular, that are present in the actual system … … The real or realistically-simulated climate system is far more complex than an absurdly simple system simulated by the toys that have been used for climate predictions to date, and will be insurmountably difficult for those naïve climate researchers who have zero or very limited understanding of geophysical fluid dynamics. I understand geophysical fluid dynamics just a little, but enough to realize that the dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans are absolutely critical facets of the climate system if one hopes to ever make any meaningful prediction of climate variation. Solar input, absurdly, is modelled as a “never changing quantity”. He says, “It has only been several decades since we acquired an ability to accurately monitor the incoming solar energy. In these several decades only, it has varied by one to two watts per square metre. Is it reasonable to assume that it will not vary any more than that in the next hundred years or longer for forecasting purposes? I would say, No.”

He married Margaret Broughton in 1962; she died in 1986. In 1988, he married Sheila Thompson. In addition to his granddaughter Hannah, he is survived by his wife; two children from his first marriage, Peter Houghton and Janet Malcolm; a younger brother, Paul; and six other grandchildren. An older brother, David, died in 2015.

In recent years Dr. Houghton had retired to the Welsh seaside and was fading into dementia, Hannah Malcolm said, adding: “But the sea remained with him. A good life.”

As a leader of the I.P.C.C., he had the skills of a statesman, said Jean-Pascal van Ypersele of the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. He recalled watching Dr. Houghton co-chair a meeting in 1995 in Madrid that led to a statement that the smoking gun of climate change had been found: The influence of human activities on climate was becoming discernible in observations of the present, not just in projections of the future.

“Fossil fuel companies and oil-dependent countries were intensely lobbying at that I.P.C.C. meeting to try to dilute the message,” Dr. van Ypersele said. But Dr. Houghton, he added, “had a deep understanding of the science,” and “he was also a British gentleman, able to listen patiently to the views of vested interests, and manage the meeting so that scientists would have the last word, as it should be.”

After a marathon session that was still going at 4 a.m., the tough language was approved.

Despite such efforts, however, effective global action to blunt the effects of a warming world has yet to happen. In a series of Twitter messages about her grandfather, Ms. Malcolm said: “When I was younger, my consistent memory of him was warnings over the devastation waiting us if we didn’t act on climate change.

451,"Important information you need to know! As astonishing as it may sound, we are witnessing a full-blown disinformation/re-education campaign against the children of the United States. They are being taught that chemical aerosols (geoengineering/""chemtrails"") being sprayed from jets are ""harmless water vapor"". First, it clearly demonstrates that the government fully intends to continue spraying for a long time. They are conditioning your children to believe that these chemical/metallic aerosols are ""harmless"" so they won't protest, resist, or otherwise oppose the spraying when they grow up. Second, a disinformation campaign of this scale reveals the alarming reality that we are witnessing the implementation of a plan that was set in motion years ago. This plan—to kill off a significant portion of the population—is being sold to the public as being for ""the greater good of mankind"". ""Eugenic goals are most likely to be attained under another name than eugenics."" — Frederick Henry Osborn, 1937; Popular eugenicist, founding member of the American Eugenics Society, selected by Franklin Roosevelt to chair the Civilian Advisory Committee on Selective Service in 1940. Why are America's children being taught lies which cause them to accept the systematic poisoning of all life in Earth? Is it because powerful proponents of global depopulation serve in the most powerful political positions in the world? Haven't we seen this before? Do we really want to see it again? How these questions are answered is entirely up to you. This textbook is being used to teach children that chemical aerosols are harmless water vapor ""condensation trails"", but this is blatantly false. Jet engines do not produce condensation trails except under extremely rare conditions, and these will be too short and too high to be seen from the group. In fact, most people will never see a true condensation trail in their entire lives. Many skywatchers and airline pilots have come forward to express their disdain about the blatant disinformation being told to the public regarding contrail formation. Below is an excerpt from the school textbook entitled ""Weather Studies"". We have provided photos and a transcript of chapter 7 which is entitled ""Clouds, Prescription, and Weather Radar"". A familiar sight in the daytime sky almost anywhere is contrails, bright white streamers of ice crystals that form in the exhaust of jet aircraft (Figure 7.1). Contrails are modifying the cloud cover along heavily traveled air corridors between major urban areas with possible implications for weather and climate. According to some studies, contrails already cover about 5% of the sky in some portions of the eastern United States. A contrail, short for condensation trail, develops when the hot humid air in jet engine exhaust mixes with the cold, drier air at high altitudes. Turbulence in the exhaust causes the mixing. A similar process enables us to “see our breath” when we exhale on a cold winter day. For details on this process, see this chapter’s first Essay, “Clouds by Mixing.” Depending on atmospheric conditions, contrails may dissipate (sublimate) within minutes or hours, or they may spread laterally forming wispy cirrus clouds that persist for a day or so. Atmospheric scientists hypothesized that increased cloud cover caused by contrails would effect the local radiation budget in two ways: During daylight hours, contrails and their cirrus byproducts incoming solar radiation thereby cooling Earth’s surface. At night, contrails and associated cirrus clouds absorb and emit infrared radiation welling up from below thereby enhancing the greenhouse effect and elevating Earth’s surface temperature. Cooler days and warmer nights reduces the diurnal temperature range (DTR), the difference between the day’s maximum and minimum temperatures. Furthermore, contrails may stimulate precipitation locally by supplying ice crystal nuclei for lower clouds. Scientists had an opportunity to test their hypothesis regarding the impact of contrails on the radiation budget immediately after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered a three-day shutdown of all commercial air traffic in the United States. Almost immediately, contrails began to dissipate. David J. Travis, a climate scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, and colleagues at Pennsylvania State University analyzed the effects of a contrail-free sky on surface temperatures at 4,000 U.S. weather stations. They found that the DTR during the three-day period was about 1.1-Celsius degree (2 Fahrenheit degrees) higher than the long-term (30-year) average. Furthermore, the DTR for the three-day periods preceding and following the shutdown was below the long-term average. These observations support the hypothesis that contrails may contribute to climate change by making days colder and nights warmer. With the expected future increase in global aircraft traffic, some scientists expect the contribution of contrails to climate change to become more significant; the average contrail sky coverage expected to more than double by 2050. At this point, it is not known whether more contrails will have a net warming or cooling effect on global climate. Driving Question:

 How do clouds and precipitation form! Clouds whisk across the sky in ever-changing patterns of white and gray; fog lends an eerie silence to a dreary day. Clouds and fog are products of condensation or deposition of water vapor within the atmosphere. Most clouds are the consequence of saturation brought about by uplift and expansional cooling of air. Fog is a cloud that forms near, or in contact, with Earth’s surface; most fogs develop when the lowest layer of air is chilled to saturation via radiational or advective cooling. Cloud formation is an essential part of the global water cycle because without clouds there would be no rain or snow. And yet most clouds—even those associated with large storm systems—do not produce precipitation. The principal subjects of this chapter are the development and classification of clouds and fog, plus the formation and types of precipitation. We also examine weather radar, a valuable tool for locating and tracking areas of precipitation and for monitoring air motion within weather systems. This chapter closes with a summary of the various direct and remote methods for measuring precipitation. Water vapor is an invisible component of air, but its condensation and deposition products (water droplets and ice crystals) are visible. A cloud is the visible product of condensation or deposition of water vapor within the atmosphere; it consists of an aggregate of minute water droplets and/or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. This section covers the process of cloud development. Clouds are increasingly likely to form as air nears saturation. But when scientists try to simulate this process in the laboratory using a clean-air chamber, a cloud does not form even if the relative humidity is elevated well above 100%, that is, to supersaturation values. A clean-air chamber is an enclosed container of air from which all solid and liquid particles (aerosols) have been filtered out. Introducing water vapor into the chamber raises the relative humidity, but even if the relative humidity is elevated to as high as 200%, no cloud forms. How is that possible? We expect that once air becomes saturated (relative to a flat-water surface), condensation would initially produce extremely small droplets and those droplets would eventually grow into cloud droplets through additional condensation. However, droplets will not form in the first place unless the relative humidity rises to extraordinarily high levels of supersaturation. Tiny droplets cannot form in a cloud chamber without a supersaturated environment because of the so-called curvature effect. The curvature of a water surface affects the ability of water molecules to escape (vaporize) from the water surface. The smaller the droplet, the greater is the concentration of surrounding water vapor that is necessary for the droplet to grow. The curvature of the surface of a spherical water droplet increases as the radius of the droplet decreases; that is, the surface of a small droplet has a greater curvature than the surface of a large droplet. (At the limit, a flat-water surface has no curvature.) With increasing curvature, molecules that form the surface of a droplet have fewer neighboring molecules and are more weakly bonded. Molecules composing a flat-water surface have the most neighboring molecules and are most strongly bonded. Bond strength affects the flux of water molecules from the liquid to vapor phase. For this reason, water molecules more readily escape a water droplet than a flat-water surface and water molecules more readily escape a small water droplet than a large water droplet. Consequently, at the same temperature, the saturation vapor pressure surrounding a small water droplet is greater than that surrounding a large droplet. Values of saturation vapor pressure listed in Table 6.3 are defined for air over a flat surface of fresh water and are the basis for computing relative humidity (Chapter 6). The saturation vapor pressure increases with increasing curvature (and decreasing droplet size). For droplets having a radius of 0.001 micrometer, the saturation vapor pressure at a given temperature is about 3.4 times that specified in Table 6.3, which computes to a relative humidity of 340%. On the other hand, for droplets having a radius greater than 1.0 micrometer, the difference between the saturation vapor pressure surrounding the droplet and the values listed in Table 6.3 is minimal and computes to a relative humidity only slightly higher than 100%. The bottom line: In clean air, water vapor will not condense into tiny water droplets unless the air is supersaturated to very high levels. In the real atmosphere, the relative humidity never even approaches such great supersaturation values, so tiny droplets cannot form or grow. What then makes cloud formation possible? The clean-air chamber experiment described above failed to produce a cloud because the air was not sufficiently supersaturated. In the real atmosphere, supersaturated air is not needed for clouds to develop; in fact, cloud droplets readily form as the relative humidity nears 100%. And clouds are abundant; at any given time, about 60% of the planet is shrouded in clouds. How then, do cloud droplets form? The answer: they have a head start. Suspended in air are solid and liquid particles that provide relatively large surface areas on which condensation or deposition initially takes place. These naturally occurring particles that promote condensation or deposition in the atmosphere are known as nuclei. Nuclei have radii greater than 1.0 micrometer and favor condensation (or deposition) of water vapor. Once condensation (or deposition) starts, they become comparably sized cloud droplets (or ice crystals). Additional growth of these droplets (or ice crystals) by condensation (or deposition) is more likely because they can grow in an environment with a relative humidity that exceeds 100% by only 1% or so. Most cloud particles have radii of 2 to 10 micrometers.­­ Nuclei, essential for cloud formation, are abundant in the atmosphere and are continually cycled into the atmosphere from Earth’s surface. Sources of nuclei include volcanic eruptions, wind erosion of soil, forest fires, and ocean spray. When sea waves break, drops of salt water enter the atmosphere and the water evaporates leaving behind tiny sea-salt crystals that function as nuclei (Figure 7.2). Emissions from domestic and industrial chimneys also contribute nuclei to the atmosphere. Depending on the product (liquid water droplets or ice crystals), a distinction is made between cloud condensation nuclei and ice-forming nuclei. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) promote condensation of water vapor at temperatures both above and below the freezing point of water. Within the atmosphere, water vapor can condense into cloud droplets that remain liquid even at temperatures well below 00 C (320 F). Droplets at such temperatures are described as supercooled. Ice-forming nuclei (IN) are much less common than CCNs and promote formation of ice crystals only at temperatures well below freezing. The most efficient ice-forming nuclei are substances having a crystal structure similar to that of ice and most are almost insoluble in water. Clayey soil particles are excellent ice-forming nuclei. The two types of ice-forming nuclei are freezing nuclei and deposition nuclei. Freezing nuclei are particles on which water vapor condenses and subsequently freezes; they are active at temperatures below about -90 C (160 F). Hygroscopic nuclei are a special category of cloud condensation nuclei because they possess a chemical attraction for water molecules. Condensation begins on hygroscopic nuclei at a relative humidity under 100%. Magnesium chloride (MgCl2), a salt in sea-spray, can promote condensation at a relative humidity as low as 70%! Clouds form more efficiently where hygroscopic nuclei are abundant. Many sources of hygroscopic nuclei exist in urban-industrial areas and this helps explain why localities downwind of large cities tend to be somewhat cloudier and rainier than upwind localities. The Metropolitan Meteorological Experiment (METROMEX) conducted in the 1970s demonstrated that the average summer rainfall was 5% to 25% greater within, and up to 50 to 75 km (31 to 47 mi) downwind of St. Louis, MO than upwind of the city. In more recent years, similar urban effects on precipitation were detected in Tokyo, Phoenix, and other cities. Besides being a source of hygroscopic nuclei, cities also spur cloud and precipitation development by contributing water vapor (raising the relative humidity) and heat (adding to the buoyancy of air). Furthermore, the relative roughness of a city surface induces convergence of horizontal winds, uplift of air, and expansional cooling (Chapter 8). Interestingly, not all ice crystals form on the traditional nuclei described above. While sampling ice crystals in cold clouds from aircraft, scientists discovered that the concentration of ice crystals is highly variable within the cloud and ice crystals are 10 to 1,000 times more numerous than nuclei. This discrepancy is likely explained by the presence of fragments of ice crystals that break off during midair collisions. These ice fragments then function as additional nuclei.

824,"As the World continues to see protest groups take to the streets and demand radical change in how we treat our environment, calling for the end of fossil fuels and a push for renewable energy sources we have to ask yourself what are the trade offs, what real benefit will these so called greener and cleaner energy sources provide for us?

Well, if an article by Jason Hickel in Foreign Policy, with the sub-title “If the world isn’t careful, renewable energy could become as destructive as fossil fuels.” is anything to go by there is very real reasons to be concerned!

Here is the opening few paragraphs from the article:

The conversation about climate change has been blazing ahead in recent months. Propelled by the school climate strikes and social movements like Extinction Rebellion, a number of governments have declared a climate emergency, and progressive political parties are making plans—at last—for a rapid transition to clean energy under the banner of the Green New Deal.

This is a welcome shift, and we need more of it.

But a new problem is beginning to emerge that warrants our attention. Some proponents of the Green New Deal seem to believe that it will pave the way to a utopia of “green growth.” Once we trade dirty fossil fuels for clean energy, there’s no reason we can’t keep expanding the economy forever.

This narrative may seem reasonable enough at first glance, but there are good reasons to think twice about it. One of them has to do with clean energy itself. The phrase “clean energy” normally conjures up happy, innocent images of warm sunshine and fresh wind. But while sunshine and wind is obviously clean, the infrastructure we need to capture it is not. Far from it. The transition to renewables is going to require a dramatic increase in the extraction of metals and rare-earth minerals, with real ecological and social costs.

In 2017, the World Bank released a little-noticed report that offered the first comprehensive look at this question. It models the increase in material extraction that would be required to build enough solar and wind utilities to produce an annual output of about 7 terawatts of electricity by 2050. That’s enough to power roughly half of the global economy. By doubling the World Bank figures, we can estimate what it will take to get all the way to zero emissions—and the results are staggering: 34 million metric tons of copper, 40 million tons of lead, 50 million tons of zinc, 162 million tons of aluminum, and no less than 4.8 billion tons of iron.

So the question is this, are we really moving to cleaner and greener forms of energy sources, or are we merely creating new problems to remove another?

Material extraction is a costly business, both financially and more importantly environmentally. With the staggering amount of material resources required to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources its easy to see why many are so skeptical.

785,"The summer of 1540 was burning hot in the vine-covered hills of Burgundy, France—so hot as to be “almost unbearable,” according to one written account from the time.

In fact, it was hot all across Europe that year. In the Alps, glaciers melted, their snouts retreating up steep-sided valleys. Fires burned from France to Poland. And in the wine country of central France, the grapes withered to raisins on the vine, so the wine made from them was syrupy and extra-alcoholic.

Normally, winemakers harvested grapes at the very end of September or early October. But that year, they had to scurry to get overripe grapes off the vine weeks earlier than usual.

Now, a nearly 700-year-long record of harvest dates from the town of Beaune, in Burgundy, shows that early harvest dates like the one from 1540 are now par for the course, thanks to climate change. Scientists and historians stitched together a record of grape harvest dates going back to 1354. They found that air temperatures have warmed so much—and especially in the last 30 years—that grapes are now harvested almost two weeks before their historical norm.

“We can clearly see the reaction of the grapes to the rise in temperature,” says Thomas Labbé, an historian at the University of Leipzig.

And that reaction is changing the wine itself.

Wine, in Burgundy, is built into the fabric of the culture. The pinot noir and chardonnay grapes the region is known for have been growing there and adapting to the precise climate conditions of the region for centuries.

Winemakers know the growth stages intimately: the look of the vines before they bud; the look of the vines as they mature over long seasons; and the fat, sugary, fragrant curve of the grapes when they’re ready to be made into wine.

That harvest point is crucial. Too long on the vine and the grapes have too much sugar in them, meaning the wine will be more alcoholic—not the subtle feel most winemakers in the region care for. Too long, and the acids that give wine some of its feel in the mouth may disintegrate. Not long enough, and they might not have developed the right balance of fragrant chemicals that give the wine its characteristic flavours.

Winemakers keep careful track of harvest dates, with some records stretching back to the Middle Ages. In the 1800s, scientists and historians realised that those careful records could be used to keep track of how the climate in different parts of Europe has changed over time.

“Grape harvest date records are the longest records of phonology in Europe,” says Elizabeth Wolkovich, a biologist at the University of British Columbia who studies wine and climate relationships. “We have these hundreds of years of records of what the summer temp was like, and we can use them like a thermometer.”

Grape harvest dates reflect the temperature the grapes have felt over the course of the growing season, from about April until they’re picked. If the spring and summer are hot, the grapes mature faster and need to be picked sooner. If they're cool, the opposite is true.

Climate historians started to pull together ancient information from other sources, too. They matched up the patterns in the grape harvest data with records made from tree rings and the length of glaciers in the Alps. They used records like those to figure out that much of central Europe warmed up during the Medieval Warm Period, from around 900 to 1300. It had cooled down during the Little Ice Age, from about the 15th to the 19th centuries.

The historians saw that over the past few hundred years, temperatures wobbled around, skewing warm for short stretches and cooling down in others. But overall, climate rocked up and down around a fairly consistent average value—until recently.",mainstream,M0df46,climate.change; global.warming
297,"(CNN) The Earth is heading toward a ""global tipping point"" if the climate crisis continues on its current path, scientists have warned, as they called for urgent action to avoid ""an existential threat to civilization.""

The group of researchers, who published a commentary in the journal Nature , say there is growing evidence to suggest that irreversible changes to the Earth's environmental systems are already taking place, and that we are now in a ""state of planetary emergency.""

A global tipping point is a threshold when the planet's systems go beyond the point of no return -- such as the loss of the Amazon rainforest, accelerated melting of ice sheets, and thawing of permafrost -- the authors of the commentary say.

Such a collapse could lead to ""hothouse"" conditions that would make some areas on Earth uninhabitable.

""We argue that the intervention time left to prevent tipping could already have shrunk towards zero, whereas the reaction time to achieve net zero emissions is 30 years at best,"" the authors said.

Led by Timothy Lenton, professor of climate change and Earth system science at the University of Exeter, in southwest England, the team identified nine areas where they say tipping points are already underway.

The team claims that these events are interconnected and change in one will impact another, causing a worsening ""cascade"" of crises.

The researchers said early results from preliminary models suggest the climate is much more sensitive than first thought and that a global tipping point is possible.

""Research last year analyzed 30 types of regime shift spanning physical climate and ecological systems, from collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet to a switch from rainforest to savanna,"" they added. ""This indicated that exceeding tipping points in one system can increase the risk of crossing them in others.""

The idea of a climate tipping point is not new. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) introduced the concept 20 years ago.

Back then, the UN suggested such ""large-scale discontinuities"" would only come about when global warming exceeded 5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

But the authors say data from the two most recent IPCC reports in 2018 and September 2019, suggest tipping points can happen between 1 C and 2 C of warming.

The model highlighted the consequences of how the interactions between a variety of climate change factors, such as the loss or weakening of carbon sinks, forest dieback, ice retreat and increased bacteria respiration, could combine to form a feedback loop which accelerates climate change.

The authors acknowledge that there are limits to their understanding of climate tipping, and further investigation is needed. But they say the possible impact could be so huge and ""irreversible"" that ""to err on the side of danger is not a responsible option.""

In other words, not acting is ""too risky to bet against"" in their view.

And time is of the essence.

Hope is not lost, however. Researchers say that mitigating greenhouse gas emissions could still slow down the accumulation of these climate impacts.

What is needed, they say, is urgent international action to cut emissions, slow sea level rise, and to keep warming to 1.5 C.

""A saving grace is that the rate at which damage accumulates from tipping -- and hence the risk posed -- could still be under our control to some extent,"" they said.

""The stability and resilience of our planet is in peril. International action -- not just words -- must reflect this.""",mainstream,M09c14,climate.change; global.warming
826,"NOAA study: Increase in particles high in Earth’s atmosphere has offset some recent climate warming

A recent increase in the abundance of particles high in the atmosphere has offset about a third of the current climate warming influence of carbon dioxide (CO2) change during the past decade, according to a new study led by NOAA and published today in the online edition of Science. In the stratosphere, miles above Earth’s surface, small, airborne particles reflect sunlight back into space, which leads to a cooling influence at the ground. These particles are also called “aerosols,” and the new paper explores their recent climate effects — the reasons behind their increase remain the subject of ongoing research. “Since the year 2000, stratospheric aerosols have caused a slower rate of climate warming than we would have seen without them,” says John Daniel, a physicist at the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) in Boulder, Colo. and an author of the new study.

In fact they say that the change is rapid and doubled in the decade:

They then admit they don’t know the source of these aerosols but give this speculation:

Introducing aerosols into the upper atmosphere is call SRM for Solar Radiation Management. Here is the Huges patent describing how it is done: (Link)

A method is disclosed for reducing atmospheric warming due to the greenhouse effect resulting from a greenhouse gases layer. The method comprises the step of seeding the greenhouse gas layer with a quantity of tiny particles of materials … Such materials can include the class of materials known as Welsbach materials. The oxides of metal, e.g., aluminum oxide, are also suitable for the purpose. One technique proposed to seed the metallic particles was to add the tiny particles to the fuel of jet airliners, so that the particles would be emitted from the jet engine exhaust while the airliner was at its cruising altitude.

Here is an extensive report on how to do it and how much it would cost: Aurora Report

So NOAA is showing these aerosols are mysteriously appearing in the upper atmospher, admit they don’t know why… yet there is lots of active political action to spread these same aerosols….. hmmmm….

So if it’s in the air, are we seeing it fall to the ground? I mean if they are spraying aluminum we would see it affecting plants and animals right?

Extremely high quantities of aluminum, barium, strontium, and other metals and chemicals are showing up in rainwater, surface water and air. In just the last four years, citizens in the Pacific Northwest (Northern CA, Oregon) have taken dozens of tests where the levels of aluminum, for example, has escalated hundreds of times from the first tests, which were already unusually high. Some tests of single rain events had elevated nearly 50,000% from the original 7ppb. These tests correspond with the state of California’s own test results… This data matches data from other citizen and environmental groups testing nationwide as well as Europe. Dangerous levels of aluminum, barium and other contaminants have saturated most surface waters in much of the US and all NATO countries. The metals found exactly match the primary elements listed in a host of “geo-engineering patents”

 Patents (assigned to Hughes Aircraft, DOD, Raytheon, and others) describe the specific goal of creating artificial cloud cover (reflecting, therefore cooling), and other forms of weather/ climate modification. The California Air Quality Resources Board has studied aerosols migrating from China and these rainwater and air metals (matching the patents) are not present in rain or air approaching our continent. The contamination begins on-shore, though clearly just off-shore as well. Recent soil testing and analysis reveals that soil PH’s are now changing tremendously. A number of studies state conclusively that bio-available aluminum is highly detrimental to countless organisms, including conifers.. Sierra Nevada firs have died or begun dying by the stands, even in riparian areas where they never lack water. In the same four years (California), alarming declines in amphibians have also been observed. Aluminum drives PH towards base (alkaline), also severely affecting the forests.

Maybe we are finding the reasons for all the mass die offs…Birds, snakes, bats, bees, all sorts of aquatic wildlife are being affected. There was a recent report in England about how the snakes are in rapid decline and there is an unpublished report they are working on in the US that shows the same thing. The females are dying faster than the males and one theory is because they store fat for breeding which is being loaded with toxic chemicals.

It is not proof positive, but a good circumstantial case. We are getting closer to clear evidence someone has begun geoengineering. Our government has a long history of lieing first, admitting later. Look at MK ULTRA, radiation experiments, and many many more:

808,"While we have been hearing about this kind of thing for a while now, it is about to become reality. A group of Harvard scientists are going to be working to fight climate change in a very interesting way.

The attempts they will be making could drastically change things. Basically, they will be using different sprays to reflect sunlight artificially and in doing this work to reduce the temperature. While the idea is controversial at best if it works, we might be able to see real changes. This project is called Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx) and will be about three million dollars right off the bat just for testing.

Through this experiment, Harvard officials hope to advance their understandings on stratospheric aerosols in general so that it can be determined whether they are actually useful or not. It is thought that these researchers will be able to reduce their levels of uncertainty and determine the risks and benefits of solar geoengineering. If these sprays could potentially eliminate or reduce our ozone loss in the long run without risks, we might have a good solution for now.

Harvard wrote as follows on the experiment itself:

At the heart of SCoPEx is a propelled scientific balloon that can travel a few meters per second (walking speed) relative to the surrounding air. The propellers serve two functions. First, the propeller wake forms a well-mixed volume (roughly 1 km long and 100 meters in diameter) that serves as an experimental ‘beaker’ in which we can add gasses or particles. Second, the propellers allow us to fly the gondola back and forth through the volume to measure the properties of the perturbed air.

The advantage of the SCoPEx propelled balloon is that it allows us to create a small controlled volume of stratospheric air and observe its evolution for (we hope) over 24 hours. Hence the acronym, Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment. If we used an aircraft instead of a balloon, we would not be able to use such a small perturbed volume nor would we be able to observe it for such long durations.

SCoPEx builds on four decades of research on the environmental chemistry of the ozone layer in the Anderson/Keith/Keutsch groups. SCoPEx will use or adapt many of the high-performance sensors and flight-system engineering experience developed for this ozone research. Analyzing these experiments will improve our knowledge beyond what is currently available within computer models or is measurable with confidence under laboratory conditions.

For this experiment, frozen water will be released or so researchers state. This being for now until they move forward and release calcium carbonate and other minerals. This whole operation is according to a release funded by the internal Harvard research funds that are provided by Professor David Keith and Frank Keutsch as well as Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program. We do not know what results will be obtained through this but researchers believe they have a good idea of what will come.

According to Forbes, the basis around this experiment is from studying the effects of large volcanic eruptions on the planet’s temperature. Because computer models can only go so far taking this out into the field and giving it a go is the next step. This geoengineering technique could really change things. That being said, some studies suggest that spraying sunlight reflective particles into the atmosphere could have lots of consequences and kill off crops or change weather patterns at the very least.

To learn more about SCoPEx please feel free to click here. While this report is older, it is still full of a lot of information on the experiment itself. This experiment is set to begin in 2019 as far as in the field things go. What do you think about all of this?",conspiracy,C00cc2,climate.change
32,"A growing number of Dutch Catholic are now turning to populist politicians and parties and rejecting Pope Francis's warnings of its dangers. 



Populist legislator Thierry Baudet last week “surged into the Dutch political mainstream as the biggest winner in nationwide elections.""

According to Katholiek Nieuwsblad, he is the “the new face of Dutch populism,” appealing to many Catholics who have felt politically homeless.

Baudet is against mass migration, skeptical of climate change, and an outspoken critic of the “cartel party,” in reference to the elite Dutch political establishment.

[RELATED] 4.2 Million Americans Abandon The Catholic Church In Protest Of Pope Francis

Earlier this year, Francis blamed the shortcomings of globalization on the rapid rise of nationalism.

Francis did not highlight any specific countries of political parties but reflected on national policies favoring ""quick partisan consensus"" over patient efforts for the common good.

The Pontiff expressed worry that Europe and North America are limiting their acceptance to migrants in his speech to diplomats accredited to the Vatican.

Three Dutch practicing Catholics were interviewed by Katholiek Nieuwsblad, who said they sympathize with Forum for Democracy - as the newspaper describes a former member, a ‘dormant’ member and an active member of the party.

The former member, Michiel Hemminga, is a philosopher and pro-life who is sympathetic to many of the party’s positions, but critical of others.

According to Breitbart: Forum for Democracy suffers from a certain ambiguity in its platform, Hemminga said, and some of its positions are untenable for a Catholic.

While their opposition to overreaching from the European Union (EU) and unchecked migration is open and a viable option for Catholics, on other issues tensions cannot help but arise.

“According to one of the party’s plans, at a certain point all religious people should agree to the fact that the Dutch law is above their own religious beliefs,” Hemminga said.

“For me, as a Christian, that’s not an option. I’m not suddenly going to support gay marriage or abortion, because it’s the law.”

Erik van Goor, a Catholic convert, publicist, and blogger is an early member of Forum for Democracy, who has hopes that the party will be able to shake up the current political system.

“When I understood that a political party was in the making, I was very enthusiastic about it. I don’t know what the future holds for the party, but I do think the current system needs a breakthrough. Geert Wilders hasn’t been able to do that, but I hope Forum for Democracy will,” he said.

“People are becoming more and more secular and liberal,” van Goor said.

“We run the risk of living in a world where you cannot think or say anything that is opposed by the mainstream media.”

Forum for Democracy draws many people who worry about the whole “gender craze,” he said, attracting many conservatives “who feel abandoned by a liberal left policy.”

Another convert to Catholicism, Zlata Brouwer is a “dormant” member of Forum for Democracy, who appreciated the party’s commitment to preserving Dutch culture.

“When I received my religious education, I studied the moral and cultural roots of our Western culture and how they are intertwined,” Brouwer said.

“But we throw away our own culture. Although Forum for Democracy is not a Christian party, I believe it’s the only party who tries to preserve our culture, our democracy, for future generations,” she said.

Although there are positions espoused by Baudet that she disagrees with, as a whole, she finds him more convincing than the other candidates.

“I don’t think he’s acknowledging the true origin of what he likes to preserve. My hope is that one day he will, perhaps if he gets married and starts a family,” she said.

“You need only to look at the history books to realize that the traditional marriage and the family are essential to all things created within a culture.”

651,"Mass Extinction, 'Great Dying' Could Wipe Out Life on Earth, Scientists Warn

Scientists are warning that naturally occurring global warming was behind the largest mass extinction event on Earth, and our planet may be due for another huge wipeout.

Researchers have shown that the Great Dying, which killed almost all of Earth's ocean creatures around 250 million years ago, was caused by rising global temperates.

Continued natural changes to the Earth's climate - not to be confused with Al Gore's brand of ""Climate Change"" - could lead to a repeat of the Great Dying, which killed off 96 percent of life on Earth, millions of years before humans had even evolved.

Scientists believe that global temperatures could again rise to levels that would be unsustainable for the majority of life that inhabits our planet.

Long before the dawn of the dinosaurs, Earth was populated with plants and animals that were mostly obliterated after a series of massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia.

The mass extinction, triggered 252million years ago, essentially set life on our planet back to square one, and was followed by a period spanning millions of years in which life had to multiply and evolve once more.

Now researchers have shown that the Great Dying, which killed 96 percent of Earth's ocean creatures, was caused by global warming.

As volcanoes belched gases into the atmosphere, Earth's oceans heated up, and its warming waters could no longer hold enough oxygen for life to survive.

Scientists at the University of Washington warned that a similar event could occur within the next few hundred years.

""By 2100, warming in the upper ocean will have approached 20 percent of warming in the late Permian, and by the year 2300 it will reach between 35 and 50 percent,"" said study author Justin Penn.

""This study highlights the potential for a mass extinction arising from a similar mechanism.""

The Washington team ran computer models to simulate the effects of the Great Dying on Earth's ancient oceans.

They showed that sulfur, ash, and other gases pumped into the atmosphere from volcanic eruptions starved Earth's oceans of 80 percent of their oxygen.

This is because as the oceans heated up, creatures and plants used up more oxygen as their metabolism increased.

About half the oceans' seafloor, mostly at deeper depths, became completely oxygen-free and uninhabitable to almost all life on Earth.

For the last few hundred years, the Earth has showed signs of following a similar pattern to the situation in the late Permian, researchers warned.

""This is the first time that we have made a mechanistic prediction about what caused the extinction that can be directly tested with the fossil record,"" Mr. Penn said.

""It allows us to make predictions about the causes of extinction in the future.""

The study has once again proved that global warming has always occurred naturally on Earth, for hundreds of millions of years before humans even existed.

Nowhere has this shift in public opinion been more striking than in Britain, where climate change was until this year such a popular priority that in 2008 Parliament enshrined targets for emissions cuts as national law. But since then, the country has evolved into a home base for a thriving group of climate skeptics who have dominated news reports in recent months, apparently convincing many that the threat of warming is vastly exaggerated.

A survey in February by the BBC found that only 26 percent of Britons believed that “climate change is happening and is now established as largely manmade,” down from 41 percent in November 2009. A poll conducted for the German magazine Der Spiegel found that 42 percent of Germans feared global warming, down from 62 percent four years earlier.

86,"A green fund is a mutual fund or another investment vehicle that will only invest in companies that are deemed socially conscious in their business dealings or directly promote environmental responsibility. A green fund can come in the form of a focused investment vehicle for companies engaged in environmentally supportive businesses, such as alternative energy, green transport, water and waste management, and sustainable living.

A green fund's strategy can be based on some of the following characteristics: avoiding negative company criteria (businesses such as guns, alcohol, gambling, pornography, animal testing, etc.); choosing positive company criteria (environmental programs, energy conservation, fair trade, etc.); or a combination of both strategies. Based on performance, it is not yet clear whether green funds and socially responsible investing (SRI) can consistently create better returns for investors, but they do represent a proactive step toward environmental consciousness, which many investors see as valuable.

Some have cited green investing as having begun in earnest during the 1990s, a period where investors were more seriously taking into account the harm businesses or the pressure entire industries were putting on the environment. In the wake of headline-grabbing events like the Exxon Valdez oil spill, and large and protracted fights over logging rights in the Pacific Northwest, a set of investors began to view businesses that were better at managing their environmental impact as more valuable than those who couldn't. These types of businesses, in some investors' eyes, were not only operating in a more ethical manner but had a competitive advantage over companies who were ill-equipped to reduce their impact on the environment. Still, other investors saw an ethical obligation in investing in technologies and businesses that were looking to build a sustainable society through renewable energy sources.

Some of the sectors where this investment has been taking place include the renewable energy, and buildings and efficiency sector. The renewable energy sector is a broad one, including solar energy, wind, battery, and energy storage technologies, as well as the materials that help make those technologies possible. The buildings sector includes builders who use energy-efficient materials, making each building's carbon footprint smaller – whether they're being used for commercial, residential, or office use.

Socially conscious investing has continued to gain popularity, which is due largely to increased worldwide exposure to the issue of climate change, as well as increased federal funding for alternative energy and other programs. Since 2007, the Green Transition Scoreboard, a project run by Ethical Markets Media and The Climate Prosperity Alliance, has tracked $8.1 trillion invested in the green economy through the end of 2016, more than halfway to the goal of $10 trillion invested by 2020.

Some of the green mutual funds that are available include the TIAA-CREF Social Choice Equity Fund (TICRX); Portfolio 21 Global Equity Fund Class R (PORTX) 21; and the Green Century balanced (GCBLX).

Money has poured into green funds as investors seek both socially responsible investments and returns from the uptick in green technologies such as wind and solar power. Inflows into socially conscious funds quadrupled to more than $4.3 trillion from 2012 to 2014, with the number of funds growing by 28%. Despite sometimes high fees, the funds have also garnered relatively solid performance. Socially responsible funds returned 8.1% versus 8.4% for non-socially responsible funds over the three years ended March 31, 2018. For the 10 years ended on March 31, 2018, the funds turned in 8.91% versus 9.1% for their non-socially responsible peers.",mainstream,M07dc7,climate.change
864,"Satellite Data Show Amazon Rainforest Likely Drier, More Fire-Prone This Year

Huge swaths of Brazil’s Amazon rainforest are drier than usual after a rainy season with rainfall index well below historical levels, raising concerns about a further spike in wildfires and deforestation as the dry season approaches.

Data from NASA and the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) points to stressed climate conditions: the soil is drier, temperatures are higher, and groundwater is depleted. Peak rainy season, which runs from December to February, was among the top 10 worst on record this year, with just 75% of the season’s usual rainfall.

Last year, wildfire and deforestation in the Amazon hit the highest levels in a decade. But the flames were contained by the rainforest’s natural humidity after several months of intense rainfall.

This year, the rainforest may not be so lucky.

Since taking office in January 2019, Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has scaled back environmental protections and pushed to change the country’s legislation to open up indigenous reserves to mining and other development activities that are the main drivers of Amazon destruction.

The government has also cut down on environmental raids amid the COVID-19 pandemic, opening the doors to increased deforestation, wildcat mining and land grabbing. As a result, deforestation this year increased 51% through March compared to the first quarter of 2019, according to INPE. The deforestation figure for August 2019 to the end of March 2020 is reportedly nearly twice that of the same period a year earlier.

Adding a drier climate to the mix, experts warn, may be lethal for the forest, intensifying forest dieback and allowing more untouched, healthy forest to catch fire in the long term.

Although weather forecasts for the Amazon are highly unpredictable, which could potentially reverse the current deficit, climate models by Brazil’s Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Research (CPTEC) show no indication of above-average precipitation in the coming months. “We are entering a drier season where rains are not [usually] intense enough to impact the potential for fire and other factors related to the dry season,” CPTEC climatologist Diego Jatobá told Mongabay.

Water shortages in the soil right after a rainy season also signal trouble later on in the year, says NASA scientist and hydrologist Matthew Rodell, who works with NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) satellites monitoring water levels stored deep beneath the Earth’s surface. Their data are used to predict drought worldwide.

Recent GRACE-FO images of South America have shown large areas of Brazil’s Amazon and Cerrado biomes in the deep red zone, meaning water levels are severely impacted. “If we see normal to low precipitation this year, then there is potential for drought,” Rodell told Mongabay in a telephone interview. “I would be concerned.”

But for Ane Alencar, the head of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM) and a specialist in rainforest wildfires, an increase in fires this year depends far more on political decisions than climate conditions, which she expects will be within an average range. “I have the worst possible expectations about uncontrolled human-induced deforestation and fire ignition this year. Spontaneous combustion doesn’t exist in the Amazon,” she told Mongabay.

A technical report by IPAM published this week also anticipates a surge in fires caused by the deforestation spike of 2019, as the modus operandi of land grabbers is to deforest one year then set fire the next, in order to successfully transform forest into farmland and pastures.

Drier soil conditions overlap with high deforestation rates. In northern Pará state, home to 40% of all deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon last year, early fires may happen, climate maps show.

In the area around the city of Santarém, which already has the highest deforestation rates in the Amazon, fires and land clearing may also spike after the recent paving of the BR-163 highway that cuts through the Amazon rainforest, described by Bolsonaro on Twitter as “at the heart of agribusiness.”

The gradual drying of the Amazon has concerned scientists for decades, as it threatens to set off a cycle of forest dieback that may push the rainforest over its tipping point, turning rainforest into degraded savanna. In recent years, extreme weather events like droughts and floods have increased and published data show dry seasons getting longer and more severe.

But figures on the Amazon rainy season are new. According to rainfall data shared with Mongabay by CPTEC, eight of the 10 driest rainy seasons in Brazil’s northern region recorded since 1962 happened after the year 2000. “We have observed a negative trend, a significant sign of reduction in rain through the years,” CPTEC scientist Jatobá told Mongabay.

Nevertheless, there is still some hope for reversing the current scenario. According to Nepstad, some steps are already being taken by a part of the agribusiness sector to encourage farmers to plant trees. “Farmers are on the hook to plant 6 million hectares (14.8 million acres) in the next 20 years, but they often don’t have enough money or incentives to do this. This is part of the solution,” he said.",conspiracy,C0160d,climate.change
1079,"Calls for an independent inquiry into what is being dubbed “Climategate” are growing as the foundation for man-made global warming implodes following the release of emails which prove researchers colluded to manipulate data in order to “hide the decline” in global temperatures.

Former British chancellor Lord Lawson was the latest to demand an impartial investigation be launched into the scandal, which arrives just weeks before the UN climate conference in Copenhagen. “They should set up a public inquiry under someone who is totally respected and get to the truth,” he told the BBC Radio Four Today programme.

The emails were leaked at the end of last week after hackers penetrated the servers of the Climatic Research Unit, which is based at the University of East Anglia, in eastern England. The CRU is described as one of the leading climate research bodies in the world.

The hacked documents and communications reveal how top scientists conspired to falsify data in the face of declining global temperatures in order to prop up the premise that man-made factors are driving climate change. Others illustrate how they embarked on a venomous and coordinated campaign to ostracize climate skeptics and use their influence to keep dissenting reports from appearing in peer-reviewed journals, as well as using cronyism to avoid compliance with Freedom of Information Act requests.

As expected, the establishment media has gone into whitewash overdrive, characterizing the emails as evidence of “rancor” amongst the climate community and focusing on some of the lesser emails while ignoring the true significance of what has been revealed.

Organizations with close ties to the CRU have engaged in psychological terrorism by fearmongering about the planet with doomsday scenarios, illustrating their argument with outlandish propaganda animation videos which show pets drowning and others that show computer-generated polar bears crashing to earth in a throwback to 9/11 victims jumping from the towers, when in reality polar bear population figures are thriving.

“One of the emails under scrutiny, written by Phil Jones, the centre’s director, in 1999, reads: “I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature [the science journal] trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie, from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline,” reports the London Telegraph.

The author admitted to the Associated Press that the e mail was genuine.

In another example, researchers discuss data that is “artificially adjusted to look closer to the real temperatures”. Apparently, the “real temperatures” are whatever global warming cheerleaders want them to be.

As Anthony Watts writes, attempts to claim e mails are “out of context,” as the defense has been from CRU, cannot apply in this instance.

You can claim an email you wrote years ago isn’t accurate saying it was “taken out of context”, but a programmer making notes in the code does so that he/she can document what the code is actually doing at that stage, so that anyone who looks at it later can figure out why this function doesn’t plot past 1960. In this case, it is not allowing all of the temperature data to be plotted. Growing season data (summer months when the new tree rings are formed) past 1960 is thrown out because “these will be artificially adjusted to look closer to the real temperatures”, which implies some post processing routine.

Spin that, spin it to the moon if you want. I’ll believe programmer notes over the word of somebody who stands to gain from suggesting there’s nothing “untowards” about it.

Either the data tells the story of nature or it does not. Data that has been “artificially adjusted to look closer to the real temperatures” is false data, yielding a false result.

Another email discusses changing temperature data to fix “blips” in studies so as to make them conform with expectations, which of course is the cardinal sin of scientific research.

“Conspiracy, collusion in exaggerating warming data, possibly illegal destruction of embarrassing information, organized resistance to disclosure, manipulation of data, private admissions of flaws in their public claims and much more” was revealed in the 61 megabites of confidential files released on the Internet for anyone to read, writes Andrew Bolt.

Another email appears to celebrate the death of climate change skeptic John L Daly, with the words, “In an odd way this is cheering news.”

In another communication, the author expresses his fantasy to “beat the crap out of” climate change skeptics.

In another exchange, researchers appear to discuss ways to discredit James Saiers of the Geophysical Research Letters journal, by means of an academic witch hunt, because of his sympathies with climate change skeptics.

“If you think that Saiers is in the greenhouse skeptics camp, then, if we can find documentary evidence of this, we could go through official AGU channels to get him ousted.”

Other emails express doubt about whether the world is really heating up and infer that data needs to be reinterpreted.

“The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t. The CERES data published in the August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming: but the data are surely wrong. Our observing system is inadequate.”

Scientists discuss trying to disguise historical data that contradicts the man-made climate change thesis, such as the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), which must be ‘contained’ according to one email.

Suppression of evidence is also discussed, with scientists resolving to delete embarrassing emails.

“And, perhaps most reprehensibly,” writes James Delingpole, a long series of communications discussing how best to squeeze dissenting scientists out of the peer review process. How, in other words, to create a scientific climate in which anyone who disagrees with AGW can be written off as a crank, whose views do not have a scrap of authority.”

“This was the danger of always criticising the skeptics for not publishing in the “peer-reviewed literature”. Obviously, they found a solution to that–take over a journal! So what do we do about this? I think we have to stop considering “Climate Research” as a legitimate peer-reviewed journal. Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal. We would also need to consider what we tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial board…What do others think?”

“I will be emailing the journal to tell them I’m having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor.”“It results from this journal having a number of editors. The responsible one for this is a well-known skeptic in NZ. He has let a few papers through by Michaels and Gray in the past. I’ve had words with Hans von Storch about this, but got nowhere. Another thing to discuss in Nice!”

Scientists also “discussed ways of dodging Freedom of Information Act requests to release temperature data,” reports the Daily Mail.

The emails show that scientists relied on cronyism and cosying up to FOIA officials to prevent them from being forced to release data.

“When the FOI requests began here, the FOI person said we had to abide by the requests,’ the email says. “It took a couple of half-hour sessions to convince them otherwise.”

“Once they became aware of the types of people we were dealing with, everyone at UEA became very supportive. I’ve got to know the FOI person quite well and the chief librarian – who deals with appeals.”

It is important to stress that this compendium merely scratches the surface of the monumental levels of fraud that have been exposed as a result of the hacked emails.

People will look back on this moment as the beginning of the end for global warming alarmism and the agenda to implement draconian measures of regulation and control along with the levy of a global carbon tax.

Many more revelations will be forthcoming as a result of this leak, and the desperate effort on behalf of the establishment to whitewash the whole issue will only end up making the damage worse.",conspiracy,C01824,climate.change
549,"The global strike on Friday September 20, 2019 was the largest demonstration for climate action in history. The movement that started with Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg in August 2018 has now mobilised millions, while Extinction Rebellion and other protest groups have escalated their campaigns on streets around the world. From the efforts of activists in different countries, radical “Green New Deals” are emerging as a bold, political response to the climate crisis.

“The world is waking up,” Thunberg told world leaders at the recent UN Climate Action Summit. “And change is coming whether you like it or not.”

But how long that awakening takes could be decisive for warming this century. A report published ahead of the summit declared that the impacts of climate change are accelerating – growth rates of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere were nearly 20% higher in the 2015-19 period than the previous five years, while the average rate of sea level rise has increased to 5mm per year over roughly the same period.

One author warned that limiting global temperature rise to 2°C would require tripling current commitments to reduce emissions. To hold temperatures at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, global ambition would need to increase by a factor of five.

The debate over whether climate change is happening is over, and the conversation about what should be done is beginning in earnest. As such, for the past few weeks, we’ve asked experts from around the world to describe how the world should respond to the threat of climate breakdown. We share their insights here.

The state of the Earth

Nowhere are the effects of climate change more visible than in the Arctic – a region that’s estimated to be warming at least twice as fast as the global average. Arctic sea ice reached its second-lowest extent on record in September 2019 – a mere 1.6m square miles.

A new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has revealed the changes that are underway in the oceans and the ice-covered regions of the world, and the message is stark.

“Glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking. Global sea level is rising at more than twice the rate of the 20th century. The ocean is warming, becoming more acidic and losing oxygen. Fifty percent of coastal wetlands have been lost over the past 100 years. Species are shifting, biodiversity is declining and ecosystems are losing their integrity and function.”

Earth’s oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the excess heat in the global climate system, but not without repercussions. Marine heatwaves are causing coral reefs to bleach and mass die-offs of fish and other wildlife. Not only does this added ocean heat wreak havoc on marine ecosystems, but it is changing the relationship between coastal communities and the ocean.

Wildlife populations are struggling to adapt to the disruption, both in the oceans and on land. As a result, a landmark report from an international team of biodiversity experts earlier in 2019 called for “transformative change” to economies and societies to prevent up to a million species going extinct.

Five steps to restrain emissions right now

“The UK, Norway, Sweden and France have written a target of net-zero emissions into law, [but] targets are, by definition, a statement of nothing more than intent. In and of themselves, they do not remove a single molecule of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.”

Limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C means the world has to be at net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But it’s cumulative emissions that count – if countries leave decarbonisation until the last minute, it will be too late. Rebecca Willis, a professor of climate and energy policy at Lancaster University in the UK, outlines five measures that can begin to restrain emissions right now:
• None Task all government departments with a climate agenda so that they’re obligated to show how their policies will contribute to emissions cuts.
• None Engage the public in developing climate strategies with citizens’ assemblies and involve workers in designing policy to ensure a “just transition” from carbon-intensive industries like coal mining.
• None Enact “symbolic policies” to set the investment climate and catalyse radical change – ban advertising for petrol cars for instance, or allow people to generate and sell renewable energy at home.
• None Keep all remaining fossil fuels in the ground – ban oil and gas exploration and end the US$5.2 trillion spent on subsidising the fossil fuel industry each year.
• None Set aside negative emission technologies – carbon capture and storage might play a role in absorbing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in future, but they don’t exist at a meaningful scale yet. Relying on them distracts resources from cutting emissions now.

There are technologies that already exist which are very good at capturing CO₂. Plants have perfected the process of turning carbon in the air into solid, living material over billions of years. Natural climate solutions mobilise this potential by restoring forests, wetlands and other habitats. One estimate from the UK suggests each hectare of new forest can absorb the annual carbon emissions of 90 cars.

But it’s not as simple as letting nature do all the hard work, says Sebastian Leuzinger, an associate professor at the Auckland University of Technology. The “right tree should be planted at the right time in the right place”:
• None Tree species that grow fast are able to store carbon more rapidly, but slower, bigger trees will ultimately store more in the long run.
• None Non-native trees may be better at absorbing carbon efficiently than native species, so keep an open mind to their role.
• None When choosing a species to plant, trust local foresters and the community that will have to live alongside and nurture them.

Natural climate solutions can also help society adapt to the inevitable changes ahead. Zita Sebesvari, head of environmental vulnerability and ecosystem services at United Nations University, argues that the value of rewilding here is two-fold: removing the CO₂ that exacerbates climate change while mitigating its impacts.

How to feed the planet

Leaving room for nature seems radical when humans currently exploit more than 70% of the Earth’s ice-free surface, much of it to grow food. It’s estimated that a third of all greenhouse gas emissions originate with agriculture – from deforesting farmland to raising livestock that belch methane.

Farming for meat and dairy can use up to 100 times the land area to produce a single gram of protein compared to beans, nuts and other plant sources. Little wonder that people are encouraged to eat less of it, and Alessandro Demaio, a fellow in global health at the University of Copenhagen, recommends a “planetary health diet” which involves reducing meat intake in Western countries by 50%. He also calls for:
• None Recycling organic waste as fertiliser and investing in agroforestry – where trees are grown around crops to increase biodiversity.
• None Breeding drought-resistant crop strains, making animal feed more nutritious and creating additives that can make livestock emit 30% less methane.

Sean Beer, a lecturer in agriculture at Bournemouth University, argues that eating more local and seasonal produce could go some way to decarbonising agriculture.

Reviving traditional food supply systems may also be key to guaranteeing sustainable diets for all, says Jagannath Adhikari, a sessional lecturer at the University of New South Wales.

In parts of the Himalayas, the answer to this problem is “food forests”. Local people plant useful trees and grow crops in the woodland near their homes, and protect what grows there naturally. They harvest what they need – mushrooms, honey, roots and edible plants – and sell any surplus at a market. Since community rights were restored to forest management here, worrying trends in deforestation and poverty have been reversed.

Some politicians are now supporting policies that address climate change by transforming national economies under the umbrella of a Green New Deal. Spain’s socialist party was recently reelected on a Green New Deal platform, for example, and, in the UK, the Labour Party has voted in favour of one.

The idea was born in the UK in 2007, but has been gaining ground around the world lately, especially in the US where it has been championed by congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Although the specifics vary, a Green New Deal involves large investments in clean energy sector jobs and infrastructure to decarbonise the economy and correct inequalities through job guarantees and universal basic services such as free public transport and healthcare. Governments would also be expected to slash or eliminate the billions they spend on subsidising the cost of fossil fuels.

Experts also urge for the inclusion of the insurance industry in Green New Deal discussions. A recent report from Cambridge University emphasised the large losses insurers will face under climate change and warns that it could spark a global financial crisis.

>“If governments respond appropriately to the urgent warning issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in October [2018], efforts to phase out fossil fuels will have to ramp up considerably — and quickly.”

Already, there has been a slew of lawsuits against the largest fossil fuel companies in an effort to hold them accountable for misleading the public on the risks of climate change while selling products that have contributed to it. Litigation, thus far, has not been successful, but the tide may be turning.

In the US, more than a dozen cities, counties and states are seeking damages from energy companies for the the costs of climate change, from retrofitting storm drains to upgrading sea walls. These lawsuits draw on litigation against tobacco companies and on scientific research that attributes greenhouse gas emissions to energy companies.

In the past, “the plaintiffs had difficulties tracing climate harms to specific emissions made by particular corporations … Scientific research has evolved dramatically since then.” says Lisa Benjamin, from Lewis & Clark College of Law, in Portland, Oregon.

For example, in Europe, a German court has agreed to hear a Peruvian farmer’s case against the German energy giant RWE for its role in melting the glaciers near his hometown of Huaraz and raising the risks of landslides and flooding. A study found RWE was responsible for 0.47% of historic emissions, so the farmer is seeking 0.47% of the cost for his community to adapt to climate change.

As the impacts of climate change become more clear, Thunberg’s not the only one questioning the “fairy tales of eternal economic growth”. Producing stuff consumes energy, and producing more stuff, whether it’s fast fashion or smartphones, means the ongoing and growing consumption of energy.

“This makes it very hard to decarbonise the economy,” says Simon Mair at the University of Surrey. If we stopped chasing productivity growth, decarbonisation would come easier, we’d have less “crap” and we might start investing time and human energy into good jobs that matter, like teaching and nursing.

The media is finally listening to the experts

Despite the potentially massive implications of a 2°C rise in global temperature, climate change has remained low on the news agenda. Journalists and their news organisations have largely failed to give climate change the attention it deserves and have failed to press political figures on climate issues and policies.

Years ago, climate journalists threw away the notion of putting scientific fact and climate denier opinion on equal ground. Other media are finally catching up and providing analysis and verification, and improving the scientific literacy of their audience. They are connecting climate change to local stories, focusing on solutions (instead of “doom and gloom” coverage) and adjusting their language to describe the “climate crisis”.

These shifts in journalism may yield more action on climate change. Young people tend to avoid negative news headlines; they don’t want their climate coverage to present a bleak and certain future. Instead, they want stories about the “system change” necessary to create zero-carbon societies, says Julie Doyle, from the University of Brighton. It’s not that they can’t handle the bad news, but that “they wanted to be involved in rethinking socioeconomic systems, and are inspired and empowered by working together.”

That’s why “system change not climate change” has became the rallying cry of the young climate strikers. Thunberg’s journey from a lonely vigil outside the Swedish parliament to a Nobel Peace Prize nominee at the head of a global movement took just over a year. It seems the world really is waking up, but now comes the hard part – changing the systems that fuel the climate crisis before it’s too late.

This article was amended on November 12 2019 to clarify an error. The earlier story said global emissions of carbon dioxide grew by 20% between 2015 and 2019. Instead, growth rates of carbon dioxide were nearly 20% higher in the 2015-19 period than the previous five years.

706,"TOPEKA, Kan. -- Environmentalists are struggling to get lawmakers to even discuss climate change as a serious issue in Kansas, where some leaders of the Republican-controlled Legislature question the widespread scientific consensus that human activity is dangerously warming the planet.

States such as Virginia, Minnesota and California are pursuing goals for eventually getting all of their electricity from renewable resources. But Kansas proposals aimed at reducing electricity use, making state office space more energy efficient and encouraging farmers to capture and store greenhouse gases have languished without committee hearings.

Environmentalists had to schedule their own climate change hearing earlier this month outside of lawmakers' regular meetings. Even more galling for them, a House committee's first foray Thursday into environmental policy was a hearing on a business-backed measure to bar cities and counties from banning single-use plastic bags or straws.

Some Republicans worry about the costs of pursuing initiatives for consumers, farmers and businesses, questioning whether Kansas could effectively lessen the problem. But some of them doubt it's a problem compelling enough to address and express opinions at odds with most scientists' views.

“The planet goes in cycles, and it's a natural cycle,"" said House Majority Leader Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican. “They think that the globe is warming. And guess what? If you go back through history, it did, and then it cools down, and then it warms and then it cools down.”

Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of the Kansas Interfaith Alliance, said lawmakers have avoided tackling climate change in recent years ""as the situation continues to get worse."" Of the 71 billion-dollar natural disasters the federal government says have affected Kansas over the past 40 years, more than half, or 37, occurred in the past decade, even with damage figures adjusted for inflation.

“It's frustrating beyond belief,"" Rieber said during the hearing on the bill dealing with plastic bags. ""We're fiddling while the world burns.”

Oil and natural gas production remain an important industry in Kansas, but it's also made big strides on clean energy because of a wind-farm boom over the past decade.

Wind is generating close to 40% of the state's power, only a little less than coal-fired plants do, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Two decades ago, coal-fired plants generated more than 70%. And carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 were 12% lower than they were in 1980, according to federal statistics.

But Sierra Club lobbyist Zack Pistora said Kansas could eventually get all of its electricity from renewable resources because its use of solar now is minimal. Virginia lawmakers are working on legislation to meet such a goal by 2050, while a 2018 California a law sets the marker for 2045.

“If we don't recognize that we need to do something about this, I feel like the costs are just going to get greater,” Pistora said.

Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is concentrating on making the state's energy policy office independent of the commission that regulates utilities, arguing that a separate agency would be better able to draft a long-term energy plan. She issued an executive order last month, but a House committee recommended its rejection by the full chamber, which would block the move.

Kelly's chief of staff, Will Lawrence, told a Senate committee this week that Kelly is pursuing an “all of the above” energy strategy and sees energy as “economic development.”

“People feel the discussion of climate change will be taking away things from people when we really want to concentrate on, how can we best adapt to what's happening; how can we be positive?"" said Francisco, whose northeast Kansas district includes the liberal University of Kansas campus.

The leaders of the House and Senate utilities committees said the potential costs of initiatives versus their potential benefits is a key issue. They said they don't want to take steps that, for example, increase the costs of farmers' tractors by tens of thousands of dollars for small improvements in pollution controls.

“Kansans are also very practical,” said Senate Utilities Committee Chairman Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican. “They want to do something that makes economic sense to them.”

And Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican, questioned whether it's practical for Kansas to pursue climate change as an issue without emissions reductions by foreign nations.

Wagle is a candidate for the U.S. Senate and recently criticized a new GOP congressional climate plan, arguing that it is “kind of silly” to propose spending “a lot of taxpayer dollars” when China's and India's greenhouse gas emissions would more than cancel out any benefits.

“I believe the climate is changing, but I don't see scientific consensus on, an agreement on, what the cause factors are or the resolution,” Wagle said. “As long as there is not agreement in the scientific community and among all the major nations for what should be done, it's all for naught.""",mainstream,M08478,climate.change

772,"ER Editor: We draw the reader’s attention to a piece we published by Prof. Claudia von Werlhof from 2 years ago titled The Planet Is Not Warming Up But Drying Out!

Professor Claudia von Werlhof wrote to Greta Thunberg. (see featured image) In this letter Von Werlhof says that the disruption of the global climate is not due to CO2.

Questions arose from this letter for Silvia Terribili, who asked von Werlhof to give an interview for her radio show Onda Italiana on salto.nl, April 9th. Below is the transcript of the interview.

Claudia Von Werlhof: The question is how we define climate change and its alleged reason, of which it is said it is CO2. We consider climate change, at least in the official discussion, as “global warming” and this global warming doesn’t exist. There are data from NASA, which is the North American Space Agency, and they show that in the last 18 years there was no general global warming. What exist indeed – because we are not deniers of the problem – are changes in different dimensions in the weather, in the climate and more so in the atmosphere, etc. We are going to explain this more in this interview. The second is the CO2-question, which is now very prominent as all these young people are now on the street because they believe in this story and this dogma of the CO2.

And this is very strange because a lot of scientists, real scientists, are denying the influence of CO2 as a

reason for climate change or as an influence at all. For example, there are about 30,000 scientists in the US now who say that there is no problem with CO2.They say that CO2 is not at all detrimental for the climate, and that it even is something we are to welcome and that we need for our trees and plants and as a positive effect.

So, the funny thing is that CO2 is often shown as some dirt, as if it was a dirt in the air. Then you look at the factories that are shown in this opportunity, you see the dust coming out of them, etc. This is not CO2.

CO2 is a gas that is invisible and doesn’t smell, so you don’t see it. In general, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is about. Most of that is vapour, water vapour, some 80 or 70%.

So, all these scientists who are serious scientists, are denying a negative influence of CO2 on the climate. There are even winners of the Nobel Prize etc., like Ivar Giaever, who are explaining it or people from the MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, like Richard Lindzen and others. The IPCC, the International Panel on Climate Change, founded at the end of the ’80s of the last century, however, is not so much a scientific but a political organization, and it is propagating and proposing the CO2 myth to the public.

So, this is a political question, and from the point of view of a real scientist, CO2 is not really something detrimental and is not changing any climate. It’s too tiny for that.

If you look at the origins of this debate at the end of the ‘80s, you see that before this time all the world spoke about a possible ice age, a new ice age. Lowell Ponte, f.i., wrote a book on “The Cooling”. It was in 1976.

They spoke about a cooling and a new ice age in contrast to the global warming-speech of today. There is no historical debate any more about how this myth about CO2 came about.

The IPCC was founded by Think Tanks like the Club of Rome, the World Watch Institute, the Rockefellers, etc., people who have a different interest in the whole question. And they found, I think it was an analysis by William Engdahl, who said they found or invented the myth of CO2 in order to have a common enemy defined which is humanity itself.

Humanity is guilty of producing so much CO2 by civil industry and consumption. This ideology can be used for another, a new policy. So, this was the origin of the CO2 myth and this has been their propaganda

worldwide. Then came Al Gore and everybody believes in him. This is contrasting with the fact thatThis history is generally not known. And people don’t really know anything about Nature and the Planet. There is a certain ignorance generally, and

There are a lot of changes in the world, in the climate, in many aspects, like those Dr. Rosalie Bertell found out, we’ll speak about her later, who said we are wrecking our planet. But how? It’s not by global warming, but by something totally different. This is not mentioned by these people who speak about climate change. They don’t see that there are changes, but there are different ones with very different origins.

Silvia Terribili: Yes, it seems also that computer models predicting catastrophic global warming in the coming years are parameterized, and there is a risk of framing the outcome of these methods and models. Can you say something about these models?

CvW: These models the IPCC is using are computer models. Their results are just an outcome of computer simulation. It has nothing to do with reality, and what they are measuring is what they want to measure. They just measure something like more CO2-output, but they do not consider the complexity of the climate on this planet.

They have no parameters about them and so they are really trying to fool us with what they are saying about such a big amount of climate change and global warming. This is not happening, and it will not happen because of CO2.

So, these are strange methods, and not scientific ones.

One should say they are political methods which want to prove something which is not the case. So, there is no reason why there should be such an amount of global warming of above 4 degrees, which is impossible. At least it is impossible with simply putting CO2 as a measure of this tiny amount of CO2 in the air. You would never have any effect, and it is very funny that everybody is believing this nonsense. It’s a theory, but it has nothing to do with reality, and we should look at why this theory exists. So, this is the more important question.

ST: Some 30 years ago we were being warned that the protective ozone layer had been reduced. Nowadays we don’t seem to care anymore about ozone depletion in the stratosphere. How could this be

explained because we have to be concerned about the depletion of the ozone layer and where it comes from.

CvW: The ozone question, yes. This is a very funny thing again, and it is not funny at all in the end because the ozone layer is really something that we need.

Without the ozone layer there would be no life on earth, because it protects us from cosmic radiation from the sun, especially UV-B and -C radiation, which is very toxic.

And it has been found that this radiation today is coming down to earth, which normally is prevented by the ozone layer.

But now it comes through, and this is a long story because there was the Montreal Protocol in the ‘80s which prohibited the use of CFCs, all these chemicals you have in the refrigerators, etc., because they thought it was the reason for the ozone hole.

But this was already wrong then because we know that what was really damaging the ozone was particularly radioactivity. Of radioactivity, there has been a lot in the air since the military had been

experimenting with nuclear explosions from the ‘40s and ‘50s until the end of the ‘90s, and we had about 2,200 nuclear explosions on earth and in the atmosphere, and

This is the main reason for the weakness of this layer because radioactivity is somehow eating up the ozone so that it is suffocating in a way, because ozone is a sort of atmospheric oxygen and radioactivity finishes the oxygen.

The problem is something like suffocation, and the toxic effect of radiation coming down to earth when this layer is destroyed or inhibited.

Last year, the people who were measuring the ozone layer found that it was weaker than ever; it did not recover as was proposed after the Montreal Protocol. And they found out that, on the contrary, it is not only existing in the form of holes over the Antarctic and the Arctic – the latter one existing only since Fukushima, as there was never a hole over the Arctic before.

And now we have ozone depletion even over the whole northern part of the earth.

So, the toxic radiation is not only occurring at the poles but generally it comes down and it is destroying a lot of plants and lower animal life, like insects. With the insects dying, the birds and the whole food chain is affected by the weakness of the ozone layer, and in the oceans the plankton is dying and the krill that the big fish are eating.

You have now many fish who are dying from hunger and you have dying coral reefs like, for example, the Great Barrier Reef east of New Zealand, the biggest one in the world, which is now dying, and it is almost not reproducing itself anymore. People say it is because the oceans are warming up, but this cannot be the real reason. The main problem is that the toxic radiation from the sun comes down into the water as well, and it is killing life in the oceans.

And then you have all this radioactivity from Fukushima which has been led into the Pacific so that life in the Pacific is dying out, and soon you will have no fish anymore. This is somehow very tragic because Rosalie Bertell wrote her book “Planet Earth, the Latest Weapon of War” already in 2000. She has studied all these problems, and where they come from, and she always warned about the ozone layer,

And she said that with a 20% thinning of the ozone layer there will be no agriculture anymore, because the plants will be destroyed by the toxicity of UV radiation. You can see it even on your balcony when you have your plants out there. It can already be seen that the leaves are getting brown and your plants are not growing much in the sun. So, this is maybe the biggest problem we are facing and the result of many, many effects which are destroying the ozone layer not only with the radioactivity, but also other instruments and technologies worse than any CO2 or global warming.

ST: What can we say about geoengineering and especially Stratospheric Aerosol Injection which is one of the technologies that the IPCC is in a way not suggesting, but they say it can be a solution for the global warming. What do you think?

CvW: Well, because of this world theory of global warming and CO2, we now have civil geoengineers appearing, something that didn’t exist in previous times. Now they have their research institutes everywhere, and plan to have a solution to this problem which is supposed to be “solar radiation management” SRM or SAI, with which they are planning to inject aerosols into the air to block the sun from shining and from heating up the earth.

So, instead of removing CO2, because it seems impossible politically, they are promoting this other solution to fight against the effects of so-called global warming, and this would mean blocking the sun from shining too much on earth.

So, the plan is to inject aerosols into the atmosphere, and especially David Keith from Harvard University has a project called SCOPEX for this very process. In this project he wants to inject even sulphuric acid into the atmosphere imitating something like a volcanic eruption, which they call the Pinatubo effect because the Pinatubo is a volcano that exploded in 1991 and the ashes and what came out had the effect of cooling down the temperatures.

And now they are trying to imitate this effect by adding sulphuric acid into the air. Recently David Keith, this professor from Harvard University, even said that tens of thousands of people would die from that at least, because it would mean having acids rain down on earth, which would eventually destroy all life.

I mean, these are crazy experiments they are preparing, and they go for civil geoengineers and the funniest thing about this movement of civil geoengineers is that they do not speak of the military background of all these technologies they are now propagating.

And all these movements about climate change, etc., don’t know anything about it as well. It is simply denied that these are military experiments which we know already, becauseI mean something like SRM is nothing new. We have it already in the form of the spraying of barium and aluminium and other substances that are very bad for all life and agriculture.

Monsanto for example invented a seed that is resistant to aluminium, imagine. So, things like that are occurring and the people are against it, but they don’t see that these experiments are a reality already, being a part of geoengineering, military geoengineering, that has existed now for about 70 or more years. This has been a project of the Second World War in which the military invented the nuclear as a weapon of war and after the nuclear, they invented other weapons like those of weather control.

As Rosalie Bertell said, they invented weather wars, they invented geoengineering and they invented plasma weapons which are electromagnetic weapons used by and emitted by ionospheric heaters. This is a very special technology mostly not known about, which is based on the inventions of Nicola Tesla, who was a physicist inventor in the 19th and 20th century.

So, this is a special technology which is not very well known, likein Alaska (now closed down) which is one of these ionospheric heaters that are working with electromagnetic waves.

This is a very, very dangerous technology which can also be used for producing all kinds of so-called natural catastrophes like, for example, tsunamis or earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or the change of the weather in whole regions, or producing hurricanes, droughts, fires and floods, and even changing the ocean currents.

These are technologies that are not discussed in public but have existed since the Vietnam War. They have been invented during this time and the UN Convention on Environmental Modification, the famous ENMOD convention from 1977, explains these weapons, it explains the effects they may have when they are used. So, it is not even a secret and it is decades ago that they were invented and were in experimentation, and it is like a war that is fought against the earth and the planet as a cosmic macro-being on which we depend. This is very, very dangerous and it is exactly Rosalie Bertell who has explained to us how these technologies function, namely as the post-nuclear weapons of electromagnetic mass destruction. We have these ionospheric heaters now everywhere.

ST: What is the ionospheric heater? What is it, why do they use it? What is the idea? We don’t understand because there is global warming, they said that there is a global warming. So, you are heating the ionosphere, but that’s crazy.

CvW: They are heating up the ionosphere, the sphere in the atmosphere that starts at about 80 kilometres up to about 800-1,000 kilometres. It is an electrified part of the atmosphere and when they send the electromagnetic waves up there, they are heating it up because when they heat the

ionosphere, this part of the atmosphere, they can manage these electromagnetic rays so that they come down on earth again, by making a curve. They can work with an angle and, like Rosalie said,These rays can even pass through the core of the earth.

ST: But it is also warming, so it is completely crazy because we have too much warming and we are sending some…

CvW: Because the warming is up there. It’s not down here. If there is any warming, it is up there. The NASA didn’t find a real warming of the earth in general, but you have different parts of the world that are warming up or have been warmed up like the poles, the polar regions and the mountains where the melting glaciers are, but it has nothing to do with a general global warming through CO2. Some of them are surely effects of the military use of ionospheric heaters. For example, in 1974 there was a treaty between the US and the Soviet Union, the secret Vladivostok Agreement in which they planned together to heat up the Arctic because they wanted the ice to go away to get to the oil on the floor of the northern sea, and they couldn’t get there because of the ice. Today, half of the Arctic ice has melted down already, because they used electromagnetic waves for that. ELF waves, that are extremely low frequency waves and they have thawed the Arctic with that. It has nothing to do with global warming but with this military technology.

ST: Going back to geoengineering, the solar radiation management, do we have evidence that the program is on? I mean, we see all kinds of trails in the sky, and the sky is completely sometimes completely covered by these trails. They are persistent, staying the whole time. What do you think about that phenomenon?

CvW: It is an older military technology which has been implemented for about 30 years. This started in the ‘90s and, for example, you have effects in regions like Shasta in California. They have been heavily sprayed with aerosols. It’s like Agent Orange that was sprayed on Vietnam, a toxic product from Monsanto and it’s like that. It’s toxic and, for example, in this community of Shasta in Northern California, the land is not producing anymore, everybody is sick, and the animals and plants are dying.

They had such a load of toxic materials, aerosols coming down from the sky that they got these problems, and after having analysed them, they made a big event some years ago to protest publicly against the sprayings. Nevertheless, the alternative and social movements do not accept – even ETC Group, which is very important in that respect – that this has been done, which is a reality for the people affected, and they are denying that SRM is already being used and discussing only the bad effects which this method would have on us. So, they are against it, but they are denying that these methods are in use already everywhere. Of course, you see it in the sky, and I have done some research about why they are doing it, as the military is not interested in any global warming myth. They are even denying global warming because they know better.

ST: So, they are doing that?

CvW: Yes, they are doing that, so they know better, like Trump, who knows it from the military. But I found out that they are not interested in the global warming question or so. They are doing it because of the ozone depletion, f.i. If there is an ozone hole or weakness, they cannot pass their electromagnetic waves. They need what I call a replacement atmosphere.

They need to spray aerosols as a conductor, they need an atmosphere that is conductive, and at the holes it is not. This is the reason why they are using so many metals in the spraying, heavy metals like barium and strontium and aluminium, which is not a heavy metal, but they are all conductive for electromagnetic waves. Recently I came across some research by a woman called Schmitt who lives in Venezuela. She made an analysis of these sprayings as being protective against the cosmos, something like a Faraday cage, producing a sort of grid around the earth to protect it from radiation coming in and this also has to do with the ozone depletion. The ozone layer is really the central question that has to be an alarm for us, because this is now the moment of truth. When we are not able to prevent these things happening, this destruction happening, we will die out within 20 or 30 years.

ST: But the official story, nobody is telling, talking about the ozone depletion.

CvW: No. There was an alarm last year and there was a colleague in the US, Marvin Herndon, who was

doing research about that question, together with his colleagues and he published it. He proved that ozone depletion leads to the arrival of toxic radiation down on earth. And he found out that NASA, the North American Space Agency, had already come to the same result in 2007. And they didn’t do anything. They already knew it then, but they didn’t do anything because the military thinks it can do everything it wants. If they need it, they would invent a new ozone layer. This is what they think. They think they have …

CvW: Yes, and they think that they can do whatever they want to do and prevent things from happening. But after all these nuclear explosions in the atmosphere and in the ionosphere and in the Van Allen belts, which destroyed parts of the magnetic field of the earth, they could never replace or cure the magnetic field nor the atmosphere. They couldn’t do anything about it. They destroyed it and it is destroyed. This is one of the reasons for weather changes as well. So, there are a lot of very complex reasons as to why things are happening. For example, you can even use electromagnetic waves from the ionospheric heaters in order to move the jet stream, which consists of fast winds surrounding the earth, building a frontier between hot and cold. So, if you are moving them north, you have the heat from the south in the north, and when you are moving them down south, you have the cold from the Arctic in the middle of Europe …

ST: They strongly influence the climate and the weather

CvW: With these technologies, you can do nearly everything, and you can change the vapour streams that are the humid streams around the earth. You can transport humidity to Arabia for example. This is one of the biggest businesses today, because the people there need water and you can just transport the water from here to there. So, even snow is coming down in the South Arabian desert. This is all manipulation, weather manipulation, climate manipulation. Nobody speaks about it, but it is occurring constantly. And another effect of the atmosphere being full of metal is that it is drying out, so we have much less rain in Europe, for example, which has nothing to do with warming or CO2.

ST: In Italy there is drought.

CVW: Italy is drying out, and then you have fires which are also induced, not only because it is dry, but you have directed energy weapons and laser weapons. So, you can produce these fires that were

happening in Portugal and Australia and in California. They have nothing to do with wildfires, and they are not destroying the plants, but. It is like a war that has passed through. All these things are discussed as being a result of global warming and CO2. It has nothing to do with that., so that they don’t see what has been done to the planet and to the atmosphere and to the weather, etc., so they wouldn’t look at it because they think it is all global warming.

ST: Unfortunately, we have almost to close the program, but I would like to ask you something again. On May 23 – 26, we will have European elections coming. What can we do as concerned Europeans to put climate engineering and all related risks on the electoral agenda because we expect European institutions to protect the 500 million citizens from the risks of these extremely dangerous technologies. What can we do?

CvW: What we did, inform the people. We are just now publishing a book. It is called “Global Warning!”, not warming, but warning. It is going to appear soon. Ten women are explaining their research of what we are talking about now, and this will be published by Talma Studies International in Dublin. So, I can recommend it. The problem is that people don’t know anything about what is happening around them, and they don’t get informed even if this is possible. The book of Rosalie Bertell exists in the 4th edition in German, it exists in Italian, French and Spanish. Everybody can read it and many people have ordered the 4th edition now, it has been printed 15,000 times. Somebody should have read it, but people don’t speak about it. The parties that are running for election have nothing to do with all this. The Greens should be the most interested in this question, but they are not.

We have to look behind the climate change agenda. There must be somebody who wants people to be distracted, to be organized around other issues.

You have the whole Smart City and 5G movement, the technification of the society and a sort of policies of controlled reduction of production and consumption. It is like the depopulation agenda of certain people which seems to be related to that.

I think that there are other political plans, the New World Order and interests behind it.

CO2 is only the scapegoat to prevent people from looking at them.

The Greens for example are totally involved in these plans for a so called “green” economy, but this is not the case. It is not a green economy. It is a weaponized economy which we see is approaching us.

I don’t see the Left, it has no interest in the whole question because it is concerned about progress and development, to put it like that. You need a critique of these technologies. I call it military alchemy, what we have now. But the Left is not interested in that and the other parties in any case not at all as well. So, I don’t know who is going to be interested from the point of view of the parties. People are not informed

and they don’t get informed, and people who speak about it are called conspiracy theorists, etc. How to get that to change, the change from believing in these ideologies from above in order to see what is happening in reality? How can people like this(ER: pictured with an employee of George Soros) and the young people get informed about the reality? They should know what is really going on and not what is supposed to be going on. This is the problem. It is why I wrote the letter to Greta Thunberg, to get her informed, and as I know she even recognized ultimately that there is a military problem but not the one we are discussing, that of

ST: Did she answer you?

CvW: No, of course not. Because there is a big movement behind her, the CO2 movement is behind her, of course. There have been plans: 7 years ago, it was already being discussed how to mobilize the youth. This is not just a venture of the people but an organized campaign of the other side.

ST: Claudia, we have to stop unfortunately, but we will present your book when it is going to come out and maybe we can present the book of Rosalie Bertell one more time because our task is to inform people. We do what we can to inform people.

CvW: Maybe you can translate it for Italy and the Netherlands.

ST: Yes, unfortunately, I have to stop but I thank you very much for being with us this evening and I hope to speak to you again.

Transcription by Linda Leblanc, with formal corrections of the Interview from April 9, 2019",conspiracy,C00574,climate.change; global.warming
1122,"The human mind does not easily grasp the explosive nature of exponential growth. This was demonstrated more than 40 years ago in a series of pioneering psychological experiments conducted in the Netherlands by Willem Wagenaar and his colleagues. In one study, participants were shown a hypothetical index of air pollution beginning in 1970 at a low value of 3 and rising yearly in an exponential way to 7, 20, 55 and, finally, 148 by 1974. Asked to intuitively predict the index value for 1979, many of the respondents produced estimates at or below 10 percent of the correct value of about 21,000 (which can be determined from the underlying exponential equation). Subsequent experiments have observed similarly dramatic underestimation of exponential growth and showed that it typically results from straight-line projections based on early small increases.

The deceptive nature of exponential growth is similarly conveyed by the riddle of a single lily pad in a pond. Suppose each member of this species reproduces once a day so that on the second day there are two lily pads, on the third day there are four, on the fourth day there are eight, etc. On Day 48, the pond is covered completely. How long did it take to be covered halfway? The answer is 47 days. Moreover, even after 40 days of exponential growth, you would barely know the lily pads are there, as they would cover only 1/256th (0.4 percent) of the pond at that time. For a period of time, we can easily ignore the steady exponential growth of lily pads—until they smother the pond.

With respect to the coronavirus, the initial doubling of the relatively small numbers of infected cases and deaths evoked little concern outside China in January and most of February, since, for weeks, people around the world had little or no personal exposure to the virus or its victims. But the deceptively mild and seemingly faraway beginnings of the current pandemic led health officials and governments to squander many opportunities for early intervention. As a result, in the past few weeks, the numbers have quickly become a torrent overwhelming our capacity to stop the virus’ spread and care for the victims. It took 67 days to reach 100,000 coronavirus cases worldwide. The second 100,000 cases took 11 days, and the third 100,000 took only four days. Public-health authorities are now scrambling to communicate just how steep and damaging the coronavirus growth curve has or could become, and urgent response is becoming the law of the land.

Aside from the coronavirus pandemic, the biggest, most destructive exponential growth processes that we must grapple with today are those associated with global climate change. While it might be hard for humans to detect that carbon emissions and their concentration in the atmosphere are growing exponentially right now, that doesn’t mean we should rest easy. The opposite is true. As with the coronavirus, we need to anticipate the climate crisis and act quickly and aggressively to minimize further damages before they overwhelm us.

Scientists have long recognized that carbon dioxide emissions and their resulting effects have been increasing exponentially. Figure 1 shows the monthly average carbon dioxide concentration measured at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii—the longest record of direct measurements of CO in the atmosphere. The volume of CO stood at 315 parts per million (ppm) when first measured in 1958; by the end of February 2020, it had risen by 31 percent to 414 ppm.",mainstream,M0d5bc,climate.change; global.warming

1289,"Researchers at the University of Adelaide have found that a lake on an island off the coast of Queensland, Australia, has been relatively untouched by changes in climate for the past 7000 years, and has so far also resisted the impact of humans.

Blue Lake, one of the largest lakes on North Stradbroke Island, southeast of Brisbane, has been the focus of research examining the lake’s response to environmental change over time.

Researchers studied the lake’s water discharge, water quality and comparisons of historical photos over the past 117 years, as well as fossil pollen and algae to better understand its history over the past 7500 years.

The results, published online in the journal Freshwater Biology, show that Blue Lake has remained relatively stable and resilient for millennia.

“Blue Lake is one of those rare, beautiful lakes in Australia. It’s unusual because it’s more than 10 metres deep but it’s so clear you can see to the bottom,” says the lead author of the study, Dr Cameron Barr from the University’s Discipline of Geography, Environment and Population.

“We didn’t realize just how unique and unusual this lake is until we started looking at a wide range of environmental markers.

“We know that there have been variations in climate in the region including North Stradbroke Island over recent decades, but during that time the depth, shoreline and water chemistry of Blue Lake has displayed little variation.

“We also know that the region experienced a significant shift towards a drier climate around 4000 years ago. Again, Blue Lake has demonstrated little variation over this period. This is in stark contrast to other changes in the region due to shifts in climate.

“It appears that Blue Lake has been an important climate ‘refuge’ for the freshwater biota of the region, and is in the same condition now as it was 7500 years ago. With appropriate management, the lake could continue relatively unchanged for hundreds, possibly thousands of years to come,” Dr Barr says.

Project leader and co-author Dr John Tibby, also from the University of Adelaide, says the results of this research could affect decision making about utilising the freshwater aquifer of North Stradbroke Island as a source of fresh water for the mainland.

“Our study suggests that increased extraction of ground water represents one of the few obvious threats to the stability of Blue Lake. The threat this could pose to the lake’s status as a stable freshwater refuge needs serious consideration if the regional aquifer of North Stradbroke Island is to be contemplated,” Dr Tibby says.

Wikimedia Commons Blue Lake on North Stadbroke Island in Australia has been untouched by man or climate change for the past 7,500 years, scientists say.

THE ISLAND THAT’S ONE OF WORLD’S MOST IMPORTANT WETLANDS

North Stradbroke Island lies 18 miles off the coast of Brisbane – and its lakes are classed as one of the world’s most ecologically important wetlands.

As well as Blue Lake, the waterways include Brown Lake, the Keyholes, Eighteen Mile Swamp and some small lagoons.

The Aboriginal name for Blue Lake National Park is ‘Kaboora’, which means ‘silent pool’.

A haven for wildlife, the area attracts forest birds, goannas (a type of monitor lizard) and other reptiles. Blue Lake is also home to soft-spined sunfish.

 The lake is not accessible by car, and the nearest car park is 1.5 miles away.",conspiracy,C01471,climate.change

In what future historians will mark as the exact date that the once great Nation of The United States was finally destroyed, June 1, 2009 will be the one penciled in due to the two most horrific events to have ever had occurred in their 223 year history, the bankruptcy and government acquirement of the once mighty General Motors Corporation, and America sealing its borders against the rest of the World.

The demise of the Global auto giant General Motors Corporation, by itself, is a catastrophic mark upon America, especially in light of its having armed and equipped the US Military through two World Wars, raised millions of citizens into the middle class and at its height employed nearly 350,000 workers in 150 assembly plants supporting over 2 million others in associated parts plants, dealerships and banking.

But, to the worst fate of the 101-year-old institution of American industrial might is that with its bankruptcy it has now fallen under the control of the US Government in an economic scheme based on a failed Marxist ideology that those few who are left that remember America in during her greatest hours know all too well spells the doom of their country.

Even worse, today also marks the day that the United States is slamming shut its borders against all outsiders in what one Canadian official stated was a “heightened militarization” of the US and will see its citizens for the first time in their history being forced to present government identification passports to reenter their own country from their North American neighbors Canada and Mexico.

As we have long tried to warn these people of the catastrophic dangers facing them, the events we have foretold to them for years are now being set to be poured upon these hapless Americans, who even while they cry in anguish at their demise, they can never say they weren’t warned, only that they didn’t listen.

And from our many reports over the years based on their own government’s dire predictions on any Nations ability to survive this century, the one most ignored by these Americans is the chilling report from their own Pentagon that the London Observer published and says in part:

“A secret report, suppressed by US defence chiefs and obtained by The Observer, warns that major European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a 'Siberian' climate by 2020. Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world.

The document predicts that abrupt climate change could bring the planet to the edge of anarchy as countries develop a nuclear threat to defend and secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies. The threat to global stability vastly eclipses that of terrorism, say the few experts privy to its contents.

Disruption and conflict will be endemic features of life,' concludes the Pentagon analysis. “Once again, warfare would define human life.”

Not surprisingly, the American people continue to ignore the facts that have led to the destruction of their Nation, and even to this day they continue believing the lies heaped upon them by their celebrity driven propaganda media, all the while never wondering what are the true reasons why over $25 Trillion of their personal savings and home values and all of the job gains for the past decade have been wiped out in less than six months.

This cannot be said, however, of their elite classes and government oligarchs, who even as they watch their own fellow citizens plunge into the abyss of mass starvation, homelessness, anarchy and Total Global War, they have set their Nation upon a course of confrontation with an entire World just as desperate as they are to survive what can only be described as an apocalyptic future where who lives and who dies will be determined by violence, not cooperation.

And, how far these American people have actually fallen is, perhaps, best summarized by the Russian writer Stanislav Mishin who recently wrote:

“First, the population was dumbed down through a politicized and substandard education system based on pop culture, rather then the classics. Americans know more about their favorite TV dramas then the drama in DC that directly affects their lives. They care more for their ""right"" to choke down a McDonalds burger or a Burger King burger than for their constitutional rights. Then they turn around and lecture us about our rights and about our ""democracy"". Pride blind the foolish.

Then their faith in God was destroyed, until their churches, all tens of thousands of different ""branches and denominations"" were for the most part little more then Sunday circuses and their televangelists and top protestant mega preachers were more then happy to sell out their souls and flocks to be on the ""winning"" side of one pseudo Marxist politician or another. Their flocks may complain, but when explained that they would be on the ""winning"" side, their flocks were ever so quick to reject Christ in hopes for earthly power. Even our Holy Orthodox churches are scandalously liberalized in America.

The final collapse has come with the election of Barack Obama. His speed in the past three months has been truly impressive. His spending and money printing has been a record setting, not just in America's short history but in the world. If this keeps up for more then another year, and there is no sign that it will not, America at best will resemble the Wiemar Republic and at worst Zimbabwe.

These past two weeks have been the most breath taking of all. First came the announcement of a planned redesign of the American Byzantine tax system, by the very thieves who used it to bankroll their thefts, loses and swindles of hundreds of billions of dollars. These make our Russian oligarchs look little more then ordinary street thugs, in comparison. Yes, the Americans have beat our own thieves in the shear volumes. Should we congratulate them?”

It was once quipped on an American television show, “George Washington had a vision for this country. Was it three days of uninterrupted shopping?”; sadly this is what these once great people became, all the while living their lives never bothering to read what their great founding father had really envisioned for them and warned them about…

“Government is not reason; it is not eloquent; it is force. Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.”

And, to the fearful master that government has become for these poor souls in destroying the Nation of its people for the benefit of an elite few, Washington left for his American children of this day these solemn words….

“Firearms are second only to the Constitution in importance; they are the peoples' liberty's teeth.”

Unfortunately for the entire World, these Americans have gone ‘toothless’ and lack even the slightest bit of courage their ancestors mustered to protect and preserve their Nation, and the once great United States has now slipped into the darkness of fascist rule and has become a place of slaves.

254,"Copernicus’ Atmosphere Monitoring Service said the hole's closing had nothing to do with falling levels of air pollution amid coronavirus lockdowns

A massively large and “rather unusual” hole in the ozone layer that opened up above the Arctic this spring has closed, scientists said.

Copernicus’ Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) first made note of hole in early April, and said that ozone columns in the area had reached record-breaking low values — and that most of the ozone typically found around 11 miles into the stratosphere had been depleted.

The last time a hole that strong opened in the ozone layer, which sits above Earth’s stratosphere and absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun, was spring 2011.

Late last week, however, CAMS said on Twitter that the “unprecedented” hole had come to an end.

“The Polar Vortex split, allowing ozone-rich air into the Arctic,” CAMS explained. “Although it looks like the Polar Vortex has not quite come to an end yet and will reform in the next few days, ozone values will not go back to the very low levels seen earlier in April.”

Despite the fact that air pollution has fallen due to global coronavirus lockdowns, CAMS said that COVID-19 and its subsequent quarantines likely had nothing to do with the hole’s closure.

While the hole was unusual for the Arctic, such ozone holes have developed over the Antarctic each year for the last 35 years.

Those holes are caused by an accumulation of man-made chemicals like chlorine and bromine during the winter that build up inside the polar vortex and become chemically active once sunlight returns to the area, according to CAMS.

The Arctic stratosphere is usually less isolated than its Antarctic counterpart because the presence of nearby land masses and mountain ranges disturbs the weather patterns more than in the Southern Hemisphere,” CAMS said in a release. “This explains why the polar vortex in the Northern Hemisphere is usually weaker and more perturbed than in the Southern Hemisphere, and temperatures do not fall so low.”

Even so, CAMS said that 2019’s was one of the smallest on record.",mainstream,M0b384,climate.change
296,"This article addresses the concept of climatic variation and change within the set of integrated natural features and processes known as the Earth system. The nature of the evidence for climate change is explained, as are the principal mechanisms that have caused climate change throughout the history of Earth. Finally, a detailed description is given of climate change over many different timescales, ranging from a typical human life span to all of geologic time. For a detailed description of the development of Earth’s atmosphere, see the article atmosphere, evolution of . For full treatment of the most critical issue of climate change in the contemporary world, see global warming .

Climate is often defined loosely as the average weather at a particular place, incorporating such features as temperature , precipitation , humidity , and windiness . A more specific definition would state that climate is the mean state and variability of these features over some extended time period. Both definitions acknowledge that the weather is always changing, owing to instabilities in the atmosphere . And as weather varies from day to day, so too does climate vary, from daily day-and-night cycles up to periods of geologic time hundreds of millions of years long. In a very real sense, climate variation is a redundant expression—climate is always varying. No two years are exactly alike, nor are any two decades, any two centuries, or any two millennia.

The atmosphere is a dynamic fluid that is continually in motion. Both its physical properties and its rate and direction of motion are influenced by a variety of factors, including solar radiation , the geographic position of continents , ocean currents , the location and orientation of mountain ranges, atmospheric chemistry , and vegetation growing on the land surface. All these factors change through time. Some factors, such as the distribution of heat within the oceans , atmospheric chemistry, and surface vegetation, change at very short timescales. Others, such as the position of continents and the location and height of mountain ranges, change over very long timescales. Therefore, climate, which results from the physical properties and motion of the atmosphere, varies at every conceivable timescale.

In 1938 the Grinnell Glacier filled the entire area at the bottom of the image. By 2006 it had largely disappeared from this view.

Climate change , periodic modification of Earth ’s climate brought about as a result of changes in the atmosphere as well as interactions between the atmosphere and various other geologic, chemical, biological, and geographic factors within the Earth system.

The atmosphere is influenced by and linked to other features of Earth, including oceans, ice masses (glaciers and sea ice), land surfaces, and vegetation. Together, they make up an integrated Earth system, in which all components interact with and influence one another in often complex ways. For instance, climate influences the distribution of vegetation on Earth’s surface (e.g., deserts exist in arid regions, forests in humid regions), but vegetation in turn influences climate by reflecting radiant energy back into the atmosphere, transferring water (and latent heat) from soil to the atmosphere, and influencing the horizontal movement of air across the land surface.

• None Turkmenistan Drought-resistant plants grow in the Repetek Preserve in the southeastern Karakum Desert, Turkmenistan.

Earth scientists and atmospheric scientists are still seeking a full understanding of the complex feedbacks and interactions among the various components of the Earth system. This effort is being facilitated by the development of an interdisciplinary science called Earth system science. Earth system science is composed of a wide range of disciplines, including climatology (the study of the atmosphere), geology (the study of Earth’s surface and underground processes), ecology (the study of how Earth’s organisms relate to one another and their environment), oceanography (the study of Earth’s oceans), glaciology (the study of Earth’s ice masses), and even the social sciences (the study of human behaviour in its social and cultural aspects).

A full understanding of the Earth system requires knowledge of how the system and its components have changed through time. The pursuit of this understanding has led to development of Earth system history, an interdisciplinary science that includes not only the contributions of Earth system scientists but also paleontologists (who study the life of past geologic periods), paleoclimatologists (who study past climates), paleoecologists (who study past environments and ecosystems), paleoceanographers (who study the history of the oceans), and other scientists concerned with Earth history. Because different components of the Earth system change at different rates and are relevant at different timescales, Earth system history is a diverse and complex science. Students of Earth system history are not just concerned with documenting what has happened; they also view the past as a series of experiments in which solar radiation, ocean currents, continental configurations, atmospheric chemistry, and other important features have varied. These experiments provide opportunities to learn the relative influences of and interactions between various components of the Earth system. Studies of Earth system history also specify the full array of states the system has experienced in the past and those the system is capable of experiencing in the future.

Undoubtedly, people have always been aware of climatic variation at the relatively short timescales of seasons, years, and decades. Biblical scripture and other early documents refer to droughts, floods, periods of severe cold, and other climatic events. Nevertheless, a full appreciation of the nature and magnitude of climatic change did not come about until the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a time when the widespread recognition of the deep antiquity of Earth occurred. Naturalists of this time, including Scottish geologist Charles Lyell, Swiss-born naturalist and geologist Louis Agassiz, English naturalist Charles Darwin, American botanist Asa Gray, and Welsh naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, came to recognize geologic and biogeographic evidence that made sense only in the light of past climates radically different from those prevailing today.

Geologists and paleontologists in the 19th and early 20th centuries uncovered evidence of massive climatic changes taking place before the Pleistocene—that is, before some 2.6 million years ago. For example, red beds indicated aridity in regions that are now humid (e.g., England and New England), whereas fossils of coal-swamp plants and reef corals indicated that tropical climates once occurred at present-day high latitudes in both Europe and North America. Since the late 20th century the development of advanced technologies for dating rocks, together with geochemical techniques and other analytical tools, have revolutionized the understanding of early Earth system history.

The occurrence of multiple epochs in recent Earth history during which continental glaciers, developed at high latitudes, penetrated into northern Europe and eastern North America was recognized by scientists by the late 19th century. Scottish geologist James Croll proposed that recurring variations in orbital eccentricity (the deviation of Earth’s orbit from a perfectly circular path) were responsible for alternating glacial and interglacial periods. Croll’s controversial idea was taken up by Serbian mathematician and astronomer Milutin Milankovitch in the early 20th century. Milankovitch proposed that the mechanism that brought about periods of glaciation was driven by cyclic changes in eccentricity as well as two other orbital parameters: precession (a change in the directional focus of Earth’s axis of rotation) and axial tilt (a change in the inclination of Earth’s axis with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun). Orbital variation is now recognized as an important driver of climatic variation throughout Earth’s history (see below Orbital [Milankovitch] variations).",mainstream,M114c4,climate.change; global.warming
31,"Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will commit $10bn to fund scientists, activists, nonprofits and other groups fighting to protect the environment and counter the effects of climate change, he said on Monday.

Bezos, who is the world's richest man, is among a growing list of billionaires who have pledged to dedicate substantial funds towards combating the impact of global warming.
• Possible new record as Antarctica temperature soars
• US Republican climate plan seeks to absorb - not cut - emissions

""Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet,"" Bezos said in an Instagram post. ""I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share.""

The Bezos Earth Fund will begin issuing grants in mid-2020 as part of the initiative.

""It's going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation-states, global organizations, and individuals,"" Bezos said.

Counteracting climate change has become a popular cause for United States billionaires in recent years, with Microsoft founder Bill Gates, financial-data company founder Mike Bloomberg, and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer counted among the world's wealthiest environmental philanthropists. ⁣⁣⁣

Last year, Bezos pledged to make online retailer Amazon net carbon neutral by 2040 - the first major corporation to announce such a goal - and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from US vehicle design and manufacturing startup Rivian Automotive LLC.

Bezos also said at the time that Amazon would meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord ten years ahead of the accord's schedule and invest $100m to restore forests and wetlands.

1062,"A recent NPR broadcast documents the unveiling of the depopulation/taxation scheme as envisioned by Travis Rieder, a “philosopher” with the Berman Institute of Bioethics at Johns Hopkins University, who claims that not having children is a “moral duty.”

Now, the global elitists are beginning to publicly play their hand by introducing the concept of taxing childbirth. In short, they have disguised their global depopulation scheme as being a necessary action in the effort to fight climate change.

“Here’s a provocative thought: Maybe we should protect our kids by not having them,” says Rieder.

Provocative indeed, but the scheme (at least in its first stage) is being candy-coated to make it sound more palatable to the average citizen.

The depopulation birth tax would apply more heavily to the rich, while encouraging the poor to use more birth control, according to Rieder and his colleagues, who say that the plan will not be as “abusive” as China’s one-child policy.

“It aims to persuade people to choose fewer children with a strategy that boils down to carrots for the poor, sticks for the rich.

“Ethically, Rieder says poor nations get some slack because they’re still developing, and because their per capita emissions are a sliver of the developed world’s. Plus, it just doesn’t look good for rich, Western nations to tell people in poor ones not to have kids.”

Of course, the rich can afford a “childbirth tax,” while the rest of us non-elites will be the ones forced to abandon having children to comply with the depopulation scheme.

Rieder claims that by reducing worldwide childbirth rates by “half a child per woman,” carbon emissions could be reduced by as much as one-quarter of the amount needed to avoid the “tipping point” that will lead to 4 degrees Celsius global warming by the end of the century – a level of warming that will ostensibly make the world “largely uninhabitable for humans.”

His plan has created plenty of controversy already; Rieder receives “nasty comments” online, and has raised the ire of climate change skeptics such as Marc Morano of Climate Depot.

“The warmists have now graduated from regulating our light bulbs, coal plants and SUVs to regulating our family size,” said Morano. “Let’s keep ‘global warming’ out of the bedroom!”

As radical as Rieder’s proposals may sound, there are those among the climate change activists who are calling for even more drastic measures.

According to the Sierra Club: “Childbearing [should be] a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license.”

Even more extreme is the stance of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, whose members maintain that “voluntary human extinction is the humanitarian alternative to human disasters,” and that humans should commit “species suicide” to save the environment.

The hidden agenda is no longer hidden

And so it appears that the gloves are now off, as the global elites have begun to go public with their depopulation plans.

These self-appointed saviors apparently envision a world in which they alone will enjoy the benefits of a reduced population, while the rabble are encouraged – or outright coerced – into non-reproduction.

Who gave them the power to make these decisions?

The answer is that we did – or at least many of us did – by allowing ourselves to be duped by fearmongers like Al Gore and others bent on selling the so that the elite could take over the planet and fashion it into something that serves their interests.

We need to understand that the issue is not climate change at all; the real agenda is creating a world where you and I and our children’s children will no longer be allowed to exist.

665,"On the lakefront campus of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, which in 60 years could have average temperatures resembling those felt currently in Kansas City nearly 500 miles to its south, the next wave of aspiring doctors settles in for a “Climate Change and Medicine” elective filled to capacity.

Students at Wisconsin learn under Dr. Jonathan Patz, who had already been consulting for the United Nations on accelerating man-made climate change’s health impacts decades ago. The students examine, for instance, heat-related mortality, as well as the healthy “upside” of adapting to the effects of climate change. Reducing one’s reliance on cars and eating smarter benefits the human body and Mother Earth alike, Patz argues.

Wisconsin is just one of roughly two dozen medical schools leading — although only typically by offering a few courses — in the training of physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other practitioners who will take to the front lines of diagnosing and treating the impact of climate change. That impact is showing up increasingly in emergencies, such as wildfires, and in complicated-pregnancy statistics even in developed nations. More broadly, the spread of toxins, asthma cases, cardiovascular disease and Lyme disease is on the rise, all part of what The Lancet has deemed the biggest global health threat of the 21st century.

Yet the slow drip of new or amended medical-school programs that address climate change must be accelerated, some experts stress. Their efforts got an important boost after the American Medical Association in 2019 gave its backing to expanding climate-change training.

“Climate change is our reality. It is going to change the way we provide clinical care. For that reason, it needs to be taught in every medical school across the nation,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, the K.T. Li Professor of Global Health and Health Policy at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

So far, climate-related scholarship has emerged in the last few years via elective courses and one-off lectures rather than treated as a portion of core curriculum, according to a study published in 2018 in the journal Academic Medicine. Those researchers found that a database was created but is lacking comprehensive reporting by schools of what climate-change lessons are taught. The lingering challenge: many schools believe they can’t devote significant attention to climate change in an already packed curriculum.

The time burden may be eased via shared materials. Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health formed the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education in 2017 to begin to share ideas on how to train health professionals. To date, it can count some 180 signatories of mostly public-health programs, but also over 20 medical schools and another two dozen nursing programs.

Even without dedicated coursework, existing classes should include more climate-change teaching, say proponents.

For instance, an asthma-diagnosing exercise with questions more closely tied to pollution exposure has now been in practice at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Urbana-Champaign and is driving curriculum priorities at the University of California, San Francisco, near where deadly fires raged over the last couple of years.

Air pollution is responsible for about seven million deaths a year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, which found that reducing the burning of fossil fuels could avoid 2.5 million premature deaths each year by 2050. Pollen and other aeroallergen levels are also higher in extreme heat. These factors can trigger asthma, which affects around 300 million people but can usually be treated.

Physicians also need better training in screening for vector-borne illnesses (infectious pathogens spread from one living organism to another; think ticks or mosquitoes) which are expected to increase with higher temperatures. Diagnosed cases of tick-spread Lyme disease, for instance, doubled between 2004 and 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mosquitoes are cold-blooded vectors of disease, so any mosquito-borne disease will be affected by very small changes in temperature.

Environmental changes also affect respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular mortality or stroke, said Harvard’s Jha. Globally, the medical profession also has a stake in policy around access to clean drinking water and fighting nutrient depletion in crops and food from climate effects.

The benefits of the work under way at UC, San Francisco, part of a broader statewide system, is that new practices might be implemented throughout its several hospitals, clinics and classrooms, and much of the new training is geared toward layering on to existing course work. For instance, it’s important for medical students to understand the effects that hotter temperatures can have on the effectiveness and risks of pharmaceuticals, such as antipsychotics and diuretics, said UCSF’s Dr. Sheri Weiser, an epidemiologist and practicing internist at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, who also holds a master’s degree in public health.

Arianne Teherani, Ph.D., a professor of medicine and education at UCSF, says medical training in climate awareness isn’t just about diagnostics but fully understanding the role of medicine in creating and fixing the effects of climate change. If the U.S. health-care system were a country, it would rank 13th in the world for greenhouse gas emissions, the article in Academic Medicine cites. Professors of anesthesia, radiology and pharmacy, for example, are encouraged to teach that anesthetic gases, imaging technologies and pharmaceuticals all have a significant carbon footprint that may need to be offset, at the least, with green best-practices elsewhere, such as a shift to more energy efficiency in hospitals and offices. More work is needed, Teherani says, in cutting the industry’s footprint overall.

There’s also mental health to consider. Sobering climate-change statistics, no matter their projected year for realization, are already having an impact.

Dr. Karla Ivankovich, Ph.D., a licensed clinical professional counselor and professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Springfield, said the mental-health profession has seen growing political anxiety from a widening trench of partisanship carry over into climate-change dread, and many therapists would welcome additional training.

Ivankovich said that she and other therapists are seeing patients who, among other concerns, find themselves troubled by the choice to have children more than past clients had, which Ivankovich linked in part to their fears for climate change and their response to the pickup in media coverage.

Not all who wear the white coat think that addressing climate change in the exam room is true to the profession’s intent.

“The zeitgeist of sociology and social work have become the driving force in medical education. The goal of today’s educators is to produce legions of primary care physicians who engage in what is termed ‘population health.’ This fits perfectly with the current administrator-rich, policy-heavy, form-over-function approach at every level of American education,” wrote Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, a former associate dean of curriculum at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal. “Meanwhile, oncologists, cardiologists, surgeons and other medical specialists are in short supply.”

Jha, writing in JAMA, would argue that view neglects both the climate warning signs and the way medicine should evolve.

“With the ubiquitous presence of information technology, including clinical decision support tools, students and physicians now have ready access to all the medical knowledge ever created… [Many medical schools] still spend too much time teaching topics such as laboratory methods and having students memorize anatomic details that can be covered more quickly or not at all,” he says

Health professionals operating as a gatekeeper for climate-change risks is effective, argues Dr. Courtney Howard, an emergency physician in Canada’s subarctic Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, where the changing conditions risk major life changes for her native patients in particular.

Howard routinely argues, including in this TEDx talk, that the trust medical professionals tend to cultivate with patients positions them to best teach about climate-change impacts; she cites survey statistics showing nurses routinely rank at the top of a list of professionals that people trust, with doctors in second place and politicians in dead last.

“We all have pull and we need to use it” to combat climate change, Howard regularly tells health professionals.

If Wisconsin’s Patz has his way, the future of climate curriculum will break slightly with med-school norms, equipping doctors and nurses to better engage with experts outside of the health-care setting. That includes urban planners, civil and environmental engineers, and of course, public-health officials.

Treatment and advocacy should never be separate pursuits, he argues.",mainstream,M0f381,climate.change
1050,"From building floating cities and towering sea walls to erecting snow cannons in Antarctica to help replenish melting polar ice, scientists and urban planners have proposed all sorts of schemes to defend against rising seas — one of the most worrisome consequences of climate change.

Now, designers in Indonesia have offered up what may be the most audacious plan yet: they propose building ice-making submarines that would ply polar waters and pop out icebergs to replace melting floes.

“Sea level rise due to melting ice should not only be responded [to] with defensive solutions,” the designers of the submersible iceberg factory said in an animated video describing the vessel, which took second place in a recent design competition held by the Association of Siamese Architects.

The video shows the proposed submarine dipping slowly beneath the ocean surface to allow seawater to fill its large hexagonal well. When the vessel surfaces, an onboard desalination system removes the salt from the water and a “giant freezing machine” and chilly ambient temperatures freeze the fresh water to create the six-sided bergs. These float away when the vessel resubmerges and starts the process all over again.

A fleet of the ice-making subs, operating continuously, could create enough of the 25-meter-wide “ice babies” to make a larger ice sheet, according to the designers. Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha, an architect in Jakarta and the leader of the project, said he sees the design as a complement to ongoing efforts to curb emissions.

“To stop global warming, of course we still have to reduce carbon emissions throughout the world,” he said in a message, adding that he advocated a two-pronged approach to curbing climate change: reduce carbon emissions on one hand and rebuild lost ice on the other.

Experts praised the designers' vision but cast doubt on the project's feasibility.

“It’s like trying to save the sand castle you built at the beach using a dixie cup as the tide comes in,” Michael Mann, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Penn State, said of the iceberg-making proposal.

Mark Serreze, director of the University of Colorado’s National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, offered a similar assessment. He called the project “very interesting” but said it raised more questions than it answered.

“What are you going to do, put out a flotilla of 10,000 submarines?” he said. “Who’s going to build them and how much energy does it take, and how are the submarines powered?” And unless they’re powered by wind or another clean energy source, he added, the submarines would need to burn fossil fuels, releasing even more planet-warming greenhouse gases into the air.

If the icebergs were big enough, they might help curb sea level rise indirectly by reflecting more of the solar radiation that raises global temperatures. But Serreze said creating the bergs wouldn’t lower sea levels directly if they remained in the water; they'd have to wind up on land to reduce the volume of the oceans.

More important, Serreze said, rebuilding sea ice would do nothing to address the greenhouse gas emissions that are the root cause of climate change. “It’s simply a Band-Aid,” he said of the ice-making vessel idea.

Serreze voiced similar concerns about other recent proposals for geoengineering the environment to mitigate the effects of climate change, including everything from spraying sunlight-blocking aerosols into the atmosphere to deploying millions of wind-powered pumps to spread seawater over the planet's northernmost reaches.

Such plans are often not feasible, he said, and they could have unintended consequences that compound our environmental problems. For example, he said, the spraying of aerosols in one region could lead to droughts in another. Nevertheless, he called geoengineering an important tool in the ongoing fight against climate change — but one that should be considered a last resort.

“There has been a lot of work on geoengineering, and it should continue,” he said. “We never want to go in that direction. But if it’s a last gasp, then you try it.”

767,"FRIDAY, Dec. 20, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Rising obesity rates worldwide may be contributing to the climate crisis, researchers report.

""Our analysis suggests that, in addition to beneficial effects on morbidity, mortality and health care costs, managing obesity can favorably affect the environment as well,"" said study corresponding author Faidon Magkos, from the department of nutrition, exercise and sports at the University of Copenhagen, in Denmark.

Like other oxygen-dependent creatures, humans emit carbon dioxide that's produced by metabolic processes necessary to live, the scientists explained.

The amount of carbon dioxide -- a greenhouse gas -- produced by a species is determined by its average metabolic rate, average body size and the total number of individuals of the species.

Obese people produce more carbon dioxide than those of normal weight, the researchers said.

Also, obese people consume greater quantities of food and beverages that need to be produced and transported to them, and transportation of obese people requires more consumption of fossil fuels. This means higher carbon dioxide emissions related to food production and transportation for obese people, the study authors explained.

The researchers estimated that obesity contributes to an extra 700 megatons of carbon dioxide emissions per year worldwide, or about 1.6% of all human-caused emissions.

Overall, being obese is associated with about 20% more greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) than being a normal weight, according to the study published online Dec. 20 in the journal Obesity.

""This has important implications for all those involved in the management of obesity,"" Magkos added in a journal news release.

The researchers stressed that these findings should not lead to more stigmatization for obese people, who already face negative attitudes and discrimination.

Ted Kyle is founder of ConscienHealth, an organization that works to find sound approaches to health and obesity. ""This study makes it clear that we pay a steep price for making it difficult to access care for obesity. Not only does obesity affect the health of the individuals who have it, untreated obesity might also contribute to environmental issues,"" said Kyle.",mainstream,M0aea4,climate.change
528,"The impact of climate change is most visible in the polar regions, where ice shields are melting and the sea is rising, or in areas where hurricanes are becoming more powerful and wildfires more destructive. Yet in an interconnected world, the effects of something happening thousands of miles away will eventually be felt at home.

People in Europe are already experiencing new climate events:
• a drier Mediterranean area that is more vulnerable to drought and wildfires
• northern Europe becoming significantly wetter, with winter floods becoming more common
• urban areas (where four out of five Europeans live) exposed to heatwaves, flooding or rising sea levels, but ill-equipped for change

The consequences of climate change are not limited to weather events alone. The world could lose 99% of its coral reefs, and see its ecosystems destroyed and sea levels rise by up to seven metres. The repercussions could be very severe for food production, political stability and economic, water and energy systems.

855,"The White House laid out its policy priorities for a second Trump term yesterday, and climate change wasn’t on the agenda.

In fact, the word “climate” didn’t appear at all in the 138-page main budget document, which asked Congress for a total of $4.8 trillion to fund the president’s priorities across the federal government in fiscal 2021.

That figure would mean a slight increase in federal spending overall compared with the status quo and would enable the Trump administration to grow the military to include the U.S. Space Force and to fund favorite infrastructure projects like the border wall.

But the agencies that are most responsible for addressing climate change at home and abroad—including EPA and the departments of Energy and State—would see steep cuts under the proposal. And programs within those agencies that deal directly with climate change would take the biggest hit.

Congress, however, is almost certain to reject the budget blueprint as is.

For one thing, it violates a bipartisan agreement on spending that Congress reached last summer. In addition—even before Democrats gained control of the House—Congress routinely would override Trump’s efforts to slash funding for climate-related items such as EPA grants to states and DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, a research and development program.

And this year Congress is likely to finish funding the federal government after November’s presidential election. The result likely will weigh heavily on the appropriations process.

But the budget document does provide a sneak peek of what Trump would like to do with a second term, including an extension to the 2017 tax cuts and continued efforts toward deregulation. And it includes his reelection pitch to voters—insomuch that it argues that his pro-business policies have resulted in a “blue-collar” economic boom that has benefited workers, especially those in the energy sector.

In the budget proposal, as in last week’s State of the Union address, Trump celebrated the United States’ arrival as a major oil and gas producer that’s set in 2020 to be a net petroleum exporter.

The shift began under President Obama, but Trump claimed credit for himself and his deregulatory policies.

“More jobs, lower costs, and American dominance—these are predictable results of our pro-energy policies,” Trump wrote in his budget request.

EPA, which is celebrating half a century of existence this year, would receive $6.7 billion for fiscal 2021—a 27% cut compared with enacted levels. It also would slash its workforce by about 11%, to the lowest levels since 1985.

The administration stressed in the budget and its supporting documents that this change would return EPA to its “core mission” of protecting “clean air, land and water, and ensuring chemical safety, while targeting emerging domestic and global environmental challenges.”

It’s unclear whether the last part of that line is a veiled reference to climate change, but the issue isn’t mentioned by name in the EPA section of the main budget document. In an informal summary provided by EPA, it appears six times—mainly in the titles of programs slated for elimination.

EPA tangled with California last year over the state’s struggle to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

The budget asks Congress for a total of $437 million for EPA’s air quality work overall, down from the current funding level of $813 million. That includes reduced budgets for enforcement, science and technology, and other programs.

The air and energy research program, which supports future regulations, would lose two-thirds of its budget—a sign that EPA under Trump isn’t contemplating many new regulatory actions.

The budget request also would cut funding to implement the Montreal Protocol, a globally popular ozone treaty that’s now also phasing down hydrofluorocarbons—a powerful class of greenhouse gases used in cooling and refrigeration.

While there’s scant mention of climate change in EPA’s budget, the issue does appear in a section on “wasteful"" spending items at EPA that the Trump administration has recommended for the chopping block.

The budget again proposes moving the Energy Star energy efficiency program—which is jointly administered by EPA and DOE—to a user-fee model that Congress previously has rejected. The same section also floated plans to zero out funding for several EPA climate change partnership programs including the Coalbed Methane Outreach Program, the Global Methane Initiative and Natural Gas STAR.

“These programs are not essential to EPA’s core mission and can be implemented by the private sector,” it states.

Sean Alcorn, a legislative analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the proposal to cut full-time EPA staff from 14,172 positions to 12,610 would get rid of expertise at the agency—a move that could pay dividends for Trump’s anti-regulatory agenda even if he doesn’t win in November.

“This is trying to eviscerate the knowledge store that we have for future administrations,” he said. “It’s setting EPA up to fail in future years.”

The fiscal 2021 budget justification for the State Department includes one fleeting reference to climate change as an issue, like armed conflict and poverty, that is best solved through multilateral channels. But the Trump administration again proposes steep cuts to the top diplomatic agency of more than 21% to $40.8 billion, down from $53 billion enacted for fiscal 2020.

The scope of the cuts is difficult to gauge because the proposal eliminates some budget lines and combines others. But observers say the result would be deep reductions in U.S. support for multilateral and bilateral partnerships on the environment, renewable energy, adaptation, sustainable landscapes, forestry and other issues. Capitol Hill generally has rejected those moves and seems likely to do so again.

In the last two years, Congress has rejected Trump administration efforts to halve support for the Global Environment Facility, which funds projects in developing countries. The United States remains a top contributor to the fund despite efforts by the Trump administration to zero out funding for fiscal 2020.

“I think the message to the vulnerable countries that get support from the GEF and from other funds is to pay attention to what gets into the final appropriations bill and not what is said in these requests, because they are messaging documents,” said Joe Thwaites, who follows climate finance for the World Resources Institute.

But funding for the United Nations’ high-profile Green Climate Fund is unlikely to be restored while Trump is in office. The fund has been a target for GOP lawmakers who have resisted Trump’s suggested cuts to other diplomatic budget lines.

Trump’s budget request proposes major cuts to disaster-response agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers. But Congress previously has overridden similar proposals.

A cut of $1.7 billion in Army Corps funding, to $6 billion next year, would reduce the agency’s spending on flood control—but that is unlikely to be sustained. The administration wants to eliminate funding “for projects that are better suited to be carried out by states and local communities.”

But Congress has given the Army Corps more money than administrations have requested since at least 2006 and has funneled increasing amounts in the past three years as intense flooding has damaged levees, according to the Congressional Research Service.

The administration is renewing its effort to eliminate a $10 million FEMA program, enacted in the final month of the Obama administration, that helps communities pay for repairs to “high-hazard” dams whose failure could result in loss of life. Such projects are “better suited to be carried out by states and local communities,” the administration says in its budget proposal. Congress repeatedly has restored the funding.

The administration also is trying again to cut FEMA’s flood-mapping budget to $100 million from $263 million, saying that mapping the nation’s floodplains “is not solely a federal responsibility.” Congress has blocked each attempted budget cut.

The administration could find agreement with Congress in overhauling a much-maligned disaster recovery program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Congress has given HUD $40 billion in emergency funding since 2017 to help communities rebuild from major disasters such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017. But funding has been mired in huge delays because federal law requires HUD to undertake a long and detailed rulemaking process before it can release the money.

Congressional leaders from both parties—as well as advocates—are looking to revamp HUD’s disaster-recovery program so money can be allocated more quickly. The administration says in its budget proposal that it “seeks to work with the Congress to comprehensively reform and redesign” the HUD program, which it calls “slow, unpredictable, and wasteful.”

The administration wants to eliminate funding for a NASA program that is developing an observatory to monitor Earth to better understand climate change.

NASA’s Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory would produce “highly accurate and trusted climate records” that can help produce policies on mitigation and adaptation “that address the effects of climate change on society,” NASA says. The observatory is scheduled to launch in 2023.

The administration acknowledges the observatory “would provide additional capabilities over existing satellites” but says the project “is a lower priority compared to other NASA programs.” The administration’s budget boosts funding for missions to land astronauts on the moon and Mars.

The Energy Department would see a cut of 8% compared with 2020 enacted levels, to $38.5 billion. DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy is again proposed for elimination, but Congress previously has shown no willingness to kill the popular research and development program.

The Interior Department would see its budget reduced 13% for fiscal 2021, to $12.8 billion.

House Democrats have accused the Trump administration of withholding funds from the U.S. Geological Survey’s Climate Adaptation Science Centers at Interior, which operate as partnerships with universities.

Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), chairwoman of the Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, pressed the matter during testimony from USGS Director James Reilly.

Reilly claimed ignorance during the April hearing. Afterward, documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed Trump administration staffers were working to heed McCollum’s warning.

“Congress will pay attention to the implementation of this funding,” according to a June meeting agenda for high-level staffers of USGS, Interior’s assistant secretary for water and science, and the Bureau of Reclamation.

23,"Meeting in Brussels for a two-day gathering, EU heads of state and government will seek to hammer out a united energy strategy aimed at diversifying sources while reducing pollution.

In the run-up to the meeting, EU leaders have cranked up the rhetoric about the need for tough action to tackle global warming, although some environmentalists say that proposed targets do not go far enough.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who will host European leaders for the first time under Germany's EU presidency, stressed the urgency of their task by warning that Europe was at an ""important crossroads.""

""If we act decisively now, we have a chance of effectively counteracting the dangers of climate change,"" she said in her invitation to the summit.

Merkel told the British Financial Times newspaper on Wednesday that she wanted ""Europe to take a 'pioneering lead' on meaningful green initiatives.""

Merkel was seconded by former US Vice President, Al Gore who recently picked up an Oscar for his documentary on the ravages of global warming.

Speaking to reporters on a visit to Brussels to address a conference on biofuels, Gore said a European lead on the issue was vital.



""I'm trying to get my country to change its policies, but in

the meantime the European Union is absolutely key to helping the

world make the change it must,"" he said.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that Europe should not only show leadership on combating climate change, but also beef up the security of energy supplies while opening the market to more competition.

""I think there is the real possibility of showing how Europe can lead the debate on climate change, on energy security, and on deregulation in the interest of a more competitive European economy,"" Blair said on Tuesday in London.

EU leaders are expected to endorse plans to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 20 percent by 2020, from 1990 levels, and by 30 percent if other developed and emerging economies, particularly China and India, join them.

The European Union produces about 14 percent of the world's

greenhouse gas emissions while the United States, the world's

largest polluter, produces some 25 percent.

Although the summit is expected to provide a show of unity, tensions are brewing under the surface over the role of nuclear energy and the use of renewable energy sources.

One of the liveliest debates is expected on whether to set a binding target of renewable energy sources meeting 20 percent of Europe's energy needs by 2020, after foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on Monday.

Environmentalists: ""It's not enough""

Although Europe is leading efforts to combat climate change, some environmentalists warned that the EU leaders are not aiming high enough.

""The EU's energy action plan ... will fall a long way short in making Europe's energy more sustainable unless targets for both renewable share and reducing greenhouse gases are raised and tightened,"" said Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Jan Kowalzig.

Energy policy has climbed to the top of the EU political agenda over the last year as oil price spikes and cuts in gas and oil supplies from Russia have spurred the bloc to forge a common strategy to meeting their needs.

However, despite the growing importance attached to energy, the EU has struggled to hammer out a common approach, with member countries often putting national interests first, much to the frustration of the European Commission.

Such is the case with a European Commission idea to inject greater competition into the EU energy market with plans to make large, integrated gas and power companies split their generating and distribution networks.

Leaders are likely to send the plan back to the drawing board with France and to a lesser extent Germany opposed to the idea, which could cause a major shake-up of French and German energy groups.

The summit comes amid a shifting European political landscape with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi emerging shaken from a recent crisis, British Prime Minister Tony Blair increasingly a lame duck, and looming French presidential elections in April and May.

It will also be French President Jacques Chirac's last chance to leave his mark on EU policy-making after nearly 12 years in office fiercely defending French interests during meetings with EU leaders.

Looking ahead as Germany chairs the Group of Eight industrial nations this year, Merkel will likely want to take the conclusions of this week's meetings into the G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Germany in June.",mainstream,M08c62,climate.change

58,"""I don't believe that there's anybody in this world that can deny science,"" the royal said of climate change deniers

While visiting Botswana during his tour of Africa, Prince Harry addressed the mounting scientific evidence of climate change and his support for youth climate and environmental activist Greta Thunberg.

“The world’s children are striking,” he told The Telegraph, referencing the Global Climate Strike which is currently being led by Thunberg through Friday. The strike began on Sept. 20.

“There’s an emergency. It’s a race against time and one in which we are losing,” the royal father added. “Everyone knows it. There’s no excuse for not knowing that and the most troubling part of that is that I don’t believe that there’s anybody in this world that can deny science. Undeniable science and facts.”

Harry, 35, continued to speak about how “troubling” it was that there were people and leaders who do deny “science and facts that have been around for the last 30 maybe 40 years.”

“I genuinely don’t understand how anyone in this world, whoever we are, you, us, children, leaders, whoever it is,” the Duke of Sussex said to the outlet, adding, “no one can deny science, otherwise we live in a very troubling world.”

Thunberg — who was nominated for a 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to halt climate change — sailed across the Atlantic ocean on a zero-emissions sailboat to make a statement about environmental impact on her way to speak at the UN Climate Action Summit on September 23.

At the summit, Thunberg blasted world leaders for their inaction, telling them, “you have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”

Harry isn’t the only royal who has outwardly showed their support for Thunberg and her activism. His wife, Meghan Markle, featured the 16-year-old on the cover of the September issue of British Vogue, which the Duchess of Sussex guest-edited.

The theme of the issue was “Forces for Change,” and featured an array of women who have already left their powerful mark on the world.

1185,"The world must sharply draw down greenhouse gas emissions and suck billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the air if today's youth are to be spared climate cataclysm, a top scientist has warned.

""This reality is being ignored by governments around the world,"" said James Hansen, who famously announced to the US Congress 30 years ago that global warming was underway.

""To say that we are 'moving in the right direction' just isn't good enough anymore,"" he said in an interview.

Head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies until 2013, Hansen and his 18-year-old granddaughter -- who is suing the US government for contributing to the problem -- delivered that message this week at UN climate negotiations in Bonn.

Thousands of diplomats at the 12-day, 196-nation talks are haggling over the fine print of a ""user's manual"" for a treaty that will go into effect in 2020.

Inked in the French capital in 2015, the Paris Agreement calls for capping global warming at two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).

With the planet out of kilter after only one degree of warming -- enough to amplify deadly heatwaves, superstorms and droughts -- the treaty also vows to explore the feasibility of holding the line at 1.5 C.

""That is a good impulse, because if we go to 2 C, it is guaranteed that we will lose our shorelines and coastal cities,"" said Hansen.

""The only question is how fast.""

Earth's surface temperature, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, and sea levels have all changed in lock-step over hundreds of millions of years, he pointed out.

In 2016, atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide -- the main greenhouse gas -- tipped over 403 parts per million (ppm), 40 percent above the pre-industrial average and the highest level in at least 800,000 years, the UN's weather agency reported this week.

Even under optimistic scenarios, that number is projected to rise for decades.

The UN's science advisory body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has said we can ""likely"" stay under the 2 C threshold if CO2 levels don't exceed 450 ppm by 2100.

For Hansen, that's a recipe for disaster.

Meltwater from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets could add metres to sea levels by 2100, he has calculated.

""The last time in Earth's history that CO2 concentrations were at 450 ppm, sea level was 25 metres (80 feet) higher,"" he noted.

When writer and environmentalist Bill McKibben decided a decade ago to launch a campaign to fight global warming, he asked the world's best known climate scientist what he should call it.

""He had in mind the name '450.org',"" Hansen recalled.

By coincidence, Hansen was about to publish a major study that concluded the ceiling for CO2 levels should be 350 ppm, at most.

Thus was born 350.org, probably the largest grassroots climate action organisation in the world.

""Hansen does make a compelling case that many climate change impacts are occurring sooner and with greater magnitude than we expected,"" said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University.

""Jim's past predictions have proven prescient and we do indeed ignore him at our peril.""

""Hansen's contributions to the basic science of climate change are fundamental to our current understanding -- no one has contributed more,"" said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University.

Even if humanity succeeds in bending down the curve of greenhouse emissions far sooner than currently seems imaginable, it would not be fast enough to bring CO2 levels back to 350 ppm by century's end, according to Hansen.

""You would have to extract 150 billion tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere,"" more than 10 times the amount we emit each year, he said.

The technology to do that does not currently exist.

At 76, Hansen is thinking a lot about and what kind of world young people will be inheriting.

So is his granddaughter, Sophie Kivlehan, a first year university student in the United States.

Along with 20 of her peers, Kivlehan has sued the US federal government for what might best be called climate negligence.

""When the US Constitution says 'We the People,' that means young people too,"" she said in an interview.

""We have constitutional rights, and those rights are being violated.""

The case is currently wending its way through the federal court system, and could one day wind up before the Supreme Court, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs told AFP.

Government attempts to have the case thrown out have failed.

Despite his grim predictions, Hansen has not thrown his hands up in despair. He continues, for example, to campaign for a direct tax on fossil fuels as the only realistic way to achieve the necessary cuts.",mainstream,M11c6c,climate.change
644,"In honor of Rolling Stone’s Climate Crisis Issue, we asked artists to contribute messages about what they, their governments, and everyday people can do to stand up to the threat of climate change. From England to Jamaica to the United States, we are hearing from artists and activists around the world about what we can do locally, globally, and everywhere in between.

When Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA, talks about climate change, she first talks about community. “My neighbors and I have a very, very strong sense of community. And that may sound corny. ‘What does that have to do with climate change?’ But a strong community is going to help us get through climate change,” she explains. Building community not only allows for people to share fossil-fuel burdens with the people around them, Leonard argues that it’s necessary in order to band together for solutions, and build resilience to the effects of a changing climate.

In celebration of Earth Day and the global community getting together to fight climate change, we put together a single message: from disparate artistic and activist communities, from different parts of the world, with a big range of ideas on how to tackle this problem. The common thread in the struggle is our humanity, and our commitment to humanity’s future in this world. “We have a chance, but we have to fight. And the time is now,” says musician Sshh.

Along with Leonard from Greenpeace USA, our chorus of voices includes actress Jane Fonda; reggae star Ziggy Marley; Oscar-nominated activist James Cromwell; youth climate activist Jamie Margolin from Zero Hour; former Congressman John Hall of the band Orleans; Jethro Tull’s Ian Anderson; singer Jah9; drummer Zak Starkey; musician Weyes Blood; and Sshh.

231,"The climate on Earth has been changing since it formed 4.5 billion years ago. Until recently, natural factors have been the cause of these changes. Natural influences on the climate include volcanic eruptions, changes in the orbit of the Earth, and shifts in the Earth's crust (known as plate tectonics).

Over the past one million years, the Earth has experienced a series of ice-ages ('glacial periods') and warmer periods ('interglacial'). Glacial and interglacial periods cycle roughly every 100,000 years, caused by changes in Earth's orbit around the sun. For the past few thousand years, Earth has been in an interglacial period with a constant temperature.

However, since the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s, the global temperature has increased at a much faster rate. By burning fossil fuels and changing how we use the land, human activity has quickly become the leading cause of changes to our climate.

How does the climate system work?

Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat and stop it escaping into space. We call these 'greenhouse gases'. These gases act as a warming blanket around the Earth, known as the 'greenhouse effect'.

Greenhouse gases come from both human and natural sources. Gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide naturally occur in the atmosphere. Others, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), are only produced by human activity.

When short-wave radiation from the sun reaches Earth, most of it passes straight through and hits the surface. The Earth absorbs most of this radiation and gives off longer-wavelength infrared radiation.

The greenhouse gases absorb some of this infrared radiation, instead of it passing straight out into space. The atmosphere then emits radiation in all directions, sending some of it back to the surface, causing the planet to heat up. This process is known as the 'greenhouse effect'.

The greenhouse effect is critical to our survival. In fact, without greenhouse gases, Earth would be about 30 degrees colder than it is today. Without greenhouse gases and their warming effect, we wouldn't be able to survive.

However, since the Industrial Revolution, we've been adding more and more greenhouse gases into the air, trapping even more heat. Instead of keeping Earth at a warm, stable temperature, the greenhouse effect is heating the planet at a much faster rate. We call this the 'enhanced greenhouse effect' and it's the main cause of climate change.

Humans cause climate change by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. Today, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than there ever has been in at least the past 800,000 years. During the 20th and 21st century, the level of carbon dioxide rose by 40%.

We produce greenhouse gases in lots of different ways:
• Burning fossil fuels – Fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal contain carbon dioxide that has been 'locked away' in the ground for thousands of years. When we take these out of the land and burn them, we release the stored carbon dioxide into the air.
• Deforestation – Forests remove and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Cutting them down means that carbon dioxide builds up quicker since there are no trees to absorb it. Not only that, trees release the carbon they stored when we burn them.
• Agriculture – Planting crops and rearing animals releases many different types of greenhouse gases into the air. For example, animals produce methane, which is 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. The nitrous oxide used for fertilisers is ten times worse and is nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide!
• Cement – Producing cement is another contributor to climate change, causing 2% of our entire carbon dioxide emissions.

Natural changes to the climate

The leading cause of climate change is human activity and the release of greenhouse gases. However, there are lots of natural causes that also lead to changes in the climate system.

Natural cycles can cause the climate to alternate between warming and cooling. There are also natural factors that force the climate to change, known as 'forcings'. Even though these natural causes contribute to climate change, we know that they are not the primary cause, based on scientific evidence.

Some of these natural cycles include:
• Milankovitch cycles – As Earth travels around the sun, its path and the tilt of its axis can change slightly. These changes, called Milankovitch cycles, affect the amount of sunlight that falls on Earth. This can cause the temperature of Earth to change. However, these cycles take place over tens or hundreds of thousands of years and are unlikely to be causing the changes to the climate that we are seeing today.
• El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) – ENSO is a pattern of changing water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. In an 'El Niño' year, the global temperature warms up, and in a 'La Niña' year, it cools down. These patterns can affect the global temperature for a short amount of time (months or years) but cannot explain the persistent warming that we see today.

What is El Niño, what does it mean and how does it affect weather around the world?

Natural forcings that can contribute to climate change include:
• Solar irradiance – Changing energy from the sun has affected the temperature of Earth in the past. However, we have not seen anything strong enough to change our climate. Any increase in solar energy would make the entire atmosphere of Earth warm, but we can only see warming in the bottom layer.
• Volcanic eruptions – Volcanoes have a mixed effect on our climate. Eruptions produce aerosol particles that cool Earth, but they also release carbon dioxide, which warms it. Volcanoes produce 50 times less carbon dioxide than humans do, so we know they are not the leading cause of global warming. On top of this, cooling is the dominant effect of volcanic eruptions, not warming.

When looking at all the evidence, there is a large scientific consensus that humans are the leading cause of climate change. In their latest report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated with over 95% certainty that human activity is the main cause of global warming.

Natural climate cycles can change the temperature of Earth, but the changes we are seeing are happening at a scale and speed that natural cycles cannot explain. These cycles affect the global temperature for years, or sometimes just months, not the 100 years that we have observed. Meanwhile, longer-term changes like Milankovitch cycles and solar irradiance take thousands and thousands of years.

There are lots of things that affect climate change, but the evidence is irrefutable. Human activity, such as burning fossil fuels and changing how we use the land, is the leading cause of climate change.",mainstream,M0d5ce,climate.change
208,"peculiar theme park in the Hague celebrates the history of the Netherlands through a series of miniature models. The Madurodam features little canals, old-fashioned windmills, tiny tulips and, amid it all, an homage to Royal Dutch Shell, the oil giant that is the biggest company in the country and, by revenue, the second largest publicly traded oil-and-gas company in the world. There’s a Shell drilling platform, a Shell gas station and a Shell natural-gas field, complete with a drilling rig. The display is at once odd–energy infrastructure in a children’s theme park–and entirely fitting: Shell has been, for decades, one of the most powerful players both in Dutch politics and on the global economic stage.

But that could soon change. As concerns grow over the existential challenges posed by climate change, Shell must grapple with its own existential crisis: How should a company that generates most of its profits by serving the world’s enormous appetite for oil navigate a long-term future in which shifting political and economic tides threaten to make fossil fuels obsolete?

The pressure to abandon oil and gas is already in force. In recent years, protesters have swarmed Shell’s headquarters; advocates representing 17,000 Dutch citizens have sued the company; and powerful investors successfully coerced executives to say they will reduce emissions. In 2015, countries around the world promised to aggressively tackle greenhouse-gas emissions, in order to meet the target laid out by the Paris Agreement: goals that require buying and burning significantly less oil and gas.

Shell CEO Ben van Beurden has a bird’s-eye view of the situation from his corner office at the company’s global headquarters in the Hague. “We have to figure out what are the right bets to take in a world that is completely changing because of society’s concerns around climate change,” he says.

Projections from energy companies show demand for oil could peak and fall in the coming decades; some outside analyses suggest demand for oil could plateau as soon as 2025. Markets are already jittery about the industry: energy was the worst-performing sector on the S&P 500 index in 2019. In 1980, the energy industry represented 28% of the index’s value, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). Last year, it represented less than 5%. The shift away from oil looms so large that Moody’s warned in 2018 that the energy transition represents “significant business and credit risk” for oil companies. The heads of the Banks of England and France said in an op-ed that any company that does not change strategically to the new energy reality “will fail to exist.” On Jan. 14, Larry Fink, founder and CEO of investment giant BlackRock, wrote in an open letter that “climate change has become a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects.”

As oil flirts with the prospect of decline, energy executives are at odds over what to do. Some firms, like ExxonMobil, are positioning themselves to squeeze the last lucrative years from the oil economy while arguing to shareholders that they will be able to sell all their oil. Shell and a handful of others are beginning to adapt.

Under van Beurden’s leadership, Shell is charting a path that will allow it to continue to profit from oil and gas while simultaneously expanding its plastics business and diversifying into electrical power. By the 2030s, the 112-year-old fossil-fuel giant wants to become the world’s largest power company. As part of this strategy, Shell has worked to present itself as environmentally friendly. Last year, it committed to reduce its emissions by as much as 3% by 2021, and by around 50% by 2050, tying its executives’ compensation to the cuts.

Shell’s moves earned some applause among environmentalists, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.N.’s climate-science body, concluded in 2018 that to keep temperatures from rising to levels that would bring a wide range of catastrophes, countries must halve their greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 and hit net-zero emissions by 2050. That would mean more than incrementally reducing emissions; it means keeping vast reserves of oil already discovered in the ground.

Van Beurden’s strategic response shows that years of political and economic pressure–especially from governments and investors responding to a sustained public outcry–can push even the most powerful interests to change. Whether climate activists can harness this mounting pressure to compel Shell and other oil companies to transform the global energy economy may be the weightiest question of our time.

Executives at Shell knew decades ago that burning fossil fuels would cause the planet to warm, and that once climate change became a global issue, their firm would need to change. Last year, I sat down with van Beurden for a wide-ranging interview and asked him how he felt about “Shell knew,” the activist mantra that accuses the company of failing to act on climate change despite knowing the consequences. He was sanguine: “Yeah, we knew. Everybody knew,” he said. “And somehow we all ignored it.”

In the 1990s, he explained, Shell publicly acknowledged climate science and said the world needed to act to combat the problem. But at the time, neither governments nor consumers seemed too concerned about emissions, and the demand for oil was growing like gangbusters to fuel a global economic expansion. So the company dutifully responded to market demands: it produced and sold oil to turn a profit.

Nearly three decades later, Shell’s business model is shifting by the same market-driven calculus. Despite advertising that depicts the oil giant as environmentally friendly, its decision to reduce reliance on oil is not born of benevolence. It’s reacting to market forces. A 2019 McKinsey report predicts that declining gas consumption in the transport sector, because of factors like fuel efficiency and electrification, could lead oil demand to begin decreasing in the early 2030s. “The future of energy needs to evolve as something else,” van Beurden says. “And we find a role for ourselves in it.”

The shift away from oil is not just a macroeconomic calculation. In 2018, Climate Action 100+, a powerful group of global investors that now represents $41 trillion in assets, delivered an ultimatum: either Shell committed to short-term emissions-reduction targets, or it risked losing the support of some of its largest shareholders. While Climate Action 100+ held little formal power over Shell, the investors could wreak havoc within the company by opposing management in shareholder votes, a process where shareholders can force management to take specific actions. In an extreme case, the investors could ditch their Shell stock–which would undermine share prices, tank the company’s valuation and drag down executive pay. “Politics might be pretty confused and babbling at the moment,” says Anne Simpson, director of global governance at CalPERS, the largest public pension fund in the U.S., and a steering-committee member at Climate Action 100+. “But money talks.”

Meanwhile, a Dutch-led group of investors known as Follow This actually went ahead with a series of activist shareholder resolutions that, if they had garnered the support of 75% of shareholders, would have required the company to take aggressive climate action. While the resolutions failed, the threat was real.

By December 2018, Shell relented and, a few months later, made the commitment to reducing emissions as much as 3% by 2021. Significantly, the commitment included end-use emissions: the company was agreeing to take responsibility not only for its own operations, but also for how consumers use Shell’s products. The activist investors claimed victory. “The only reason Shell has made this leap forward is because investors started supporting our resolution,” Follow This founder Mark van Baal told me.

Shell’s public commitment was part of a broader rebranding effort. For decades, Shell and other oil-and-gas companies portrayed themselves to consumers as essential to modern life. Their products power your car and warm your house. But over the years, that image has soured. The 2010 BP oil spill and a series of journalistic exposés of the industry’s misbehavior stole headlines. Shell faced reports of corruption in Nigeria, where it has significant drilling operations, including its alleged complicity in government human-rights abuses. Organizers say that in September 2019, more than 7 million people marched around the globe, skipping school and work to demand that their governments take action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The U.K. declared a climate emergency and prominent members of the U.S. Congress called to eliminate the country’s fossil-fuel emissions by 2030. In July, the head of OPEC, the oil cartel that in 2018 accounted for more than 40% of the world’s crude-oil production, called climate activists “the greatest threat to our industry.”

Widespread public criticism of Big Oil is perhaps especially damaging to Shell. Unlike many of its competitors, Shell purchases much of its oil from other companies, then slaps the Shell brand on it, rather than digging the stuff out of the ground itself. That means that its consumer reputation matters more than, say, Occidental Petroleum’s. Shell also faces scrutiny as a Netherlands-based company. While U.S. firms like ExxonMobil contend with a relatively conservative political environment in Texas, Shell is headquartered in the Hague, a city where you’re more likely to get hit by a bicycle than a car. In Amsterdam, 40,000 people took to the streets last spring to demand action on climate change, and some protesters carried signs with a version of the Shell logo fashioned into a middle finger. In London, protesters demonstrated outside Shell’s offices, graffitiing the walls with slogans like crime scene and Shell kills.

“Their own company is built on the death and destruction of nature and of people all around the world,” says Farhana Yamin, a lawyer turned activist who glued herself to the cement outside Shell’s London headquarters last April. The National Theatre in London dropped Shell as a sponsor in October, just as it declared a “climate emergency,” and the Dutch branch of Friends of the Earth is suing Shell for reneging on its “duty of care” obligation under Dutch law. “All of these initiatives add to the pressure,” says Freek Bersch, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth Netherlands.

Van Beurden certainly feels the heat. In recent regulatory filings Shell listed its “societal licence to operate,” industry lingo for how society views the company, among its key concerns. Shell executives now need “to ask ourselves more questions than just, ‘Hey, is this legal or not?'” van Beurden says. They have to consider how society sees their brand.

To witness exactly how Shell is changing, I visited one of its biggest ongoing investments: a chemical facility outside of Pittsburgh estimated to cost $6 billion. When it’s completed, the nearly 400-acre site will churn out more than a million tons of polyethylene every year, the base for a host of plastic products that may become anything from packaging to toys to medical devices to car parts.

Activists describe the facility as an environmental nightmare. Studies have found plastic in tap water, in food products, and in the bellies of sea birds and whales. And plastic production is a significant driver of climate change. The chemical sector is responsible for 18% of industrial carbon-dioxide emissions, according to a 2018 report from the International Energy Agency. Emissions are expected to grow 30% by 2050. But, for Shell, the investment is emblematic of its future business model. As the company rethinks its business, it plans to expand in plastics.

Shell’s other big bet outside of oil is natural gas, which is also controversial. When burned, natural gas produces less carbon than oil or coal does, but it’s still much more polluting than renewable sources, like solar or wind. But Shell is all-in: in 2016, the company maneuvered a $53 billion takeover of BG Group, an oil-and-gas company that focused on liquefied natural gas (LNG), and two years later Shell announced it would fund a $31 billion LNG-export terminal in Canada along with other partners. Shell is widely known as one of the world’s leading natural-gas producers. The company argues that natural gas is necessary to back up clean-energy sources like wind and solar and to feed growing demand for energy in the developing world.

The company’s least contentious area of change is its investment in the power sector, delivering electricity to homes and businesses. While the power sector is widely seen as essential to reducing emissions, critics point out that it’s a tiny portion of Shell’s portfolio. Shell is now spending up to $2 billion a year building out its capacity to supply electricity–just a sliver of its roughly $25 billion capital expenditure, which is predominantly spent exploring and drilling for oil.

But Shell is rethinking its oil business, too, in recognition that its most expensive drilling ventures won’t work in the future if oil demand slows. In 2015, it ended its effort to drill in the Arctic, and in 2017 it sold off billions of Canadian oil-sand assets. Meanwhile, Shell’s total oil reserves have slowly declined compared with its competitors’. In December 2018, ExxonMobil had more than 17 years of oil reserves stored, BP had nearly 15 and Chevron more than 11, according to Bloomberg data. Shell maintained only 81/2 years of reserves.

Analysts say it’s too early to tell whether Shell’s strategy to reduce reliance on oil will pay off for shareholders in the long run. Last year, Shell, while continuing to pay large dividends, bought back stock, helping maintain its share price. The maneuver kept the company’s stock valuation roughly level, but it’s hardly a workable long-term strategy. Across the sector, companies “have to figure out who they are in this changing market,” says Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the IEEFA. “They are not the profit center that they used to be, and they probably never will be.”

The viability of sticking with oil, even as major world economies promise to move away, is uncertain. Both ExxonMobil and Chevron are staying the course, hoping to outlast their competitors. But Shell and others are moving to adapt. BP, for instance, has also invested in natural gas and power, while ConocoPhillips has prioritized “short-cycle project times” to help it stay economically competitive. Occidental has dropped money into a method of drilling that allows it to store CO2 in the ground, a bet that it can offset some of the regulatory costs of CO2 emissions within its own operations. And in December, the Spanish oil giant Repsol committed to being carbon-neutral by 2050 and wrote down many of its oil assets on the grounds that their value will diminish as oil fades.

Meanwhile, the landscape for the planet remains bleak. To keep average global temperatures from warming more than 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, oil companies would have to agree to keep trillions of dollars of oil assets in the ground. So while Shell and others are taking steps in the right direction to reduce total emissions, they are still barreling into a catastrophically climate-changed future. “Shell is doing a lot of the right things,” says a senior energy official, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely. “The question is: What award do you get for being the best-painted deck chair on the Titanic?”

Last spring, Shell announced that it was leaving American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, an influential oil-industry trade lobby. The group’s position on climate change, Shell said, was incompatible with its own. Shell cited AFPM’s lack of support for the Paris Agreement and for carbon pricing.

The news made a splash. Shell appeared to be firing a shot across the bow to other powerful lobbying groups: the politics on climate change is shifting. Get with the program or get left in the dust.

It was the latest in a series of similar moves. In recent years, Shell, as well as Exxon and BP, left the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative political group, over its stance on climate change. In 2014, Shell and other major global oil companies convened to form the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative to fund clean-energy ventures, and in 2017, a consortium of global Fortune 500 companies, including Shell, Total, ExxonMobil and BP, joined with a handful of green groups to launch the Climate Leadership Council to advocate in the U.S. for a carbon tax that reflects “the conservative principles of free markets and limited government.” A related lobbying group has spent several million dollars lobbying Congress for the proposal. Critics largely dismiss these efforts as too little, too late. They question the companies’ sincerity and suggest they may abandon their support when push comes to shove. And, given the scale of the challenge, many argue that the time has long passed for incremental initiatives.

But given the central role the oil-and-gas industry plays in both politics and the global economy, it’s hard to imagine the world tackling climate change unless the industry either loses its political power or stops roadblocking climate solutions. The rise of the oil industry is intrinsically intertwined with the rise of modern capitalism and the 20th century market economy. Oil provided the resources to power the near nonstop GDP growth of the postwar era. That history offers the modern oil industry immense political power, which it has used to block any legislation, including climate initiatives, that would curb its profits. In particular, Big Oil has spent decades funding campaigns to discredit the science linking greenhouse-gas emissions to warming and later spent millions more on messages that downplayed the catastrophic significance of climate change. For the most part, they have been successful both in blocking bills that would have curbed emissions and in securing government support for their business. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.), who wrote a book on corporate influence in government, told me he doesn’t “think there’s ever been such political might assembled on one issue in the history of the Congress” as oil-and-gas interests fighting climate-change regulation. Globally, fossil fuels receive roughly $5 trillion annually in government subsidies, a figure that includes the cost of environmental damage caused by industry that’s left to everyone else to clean up, according to a 2019 International Monetary Fund paper.

But if Big Oil’s roots are deep, belief is growing across the globe that the industry’s untouchable status needs to end. Beyond activists, public opinion in the U.S. continues to turn against fossil fuels. According to a 2019 Gallup poll, 60% of U.S. adults, including the vast majority of Democrats and a large share of Republicans, support policies aimed at reducing the use of fossil fuels. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom are polling at the top of the Democratic presidential primary, have promised to ban fracking–a move that (though unlikely) would transform the industry overnight. And, across the Atlantic, a Green Deal in the E.U. unveiled late last year proposes, among other things, to create a new tax on imports that could hit oil companies. Even the Shell display at Madurodam, that strange miniature theme park in the Hague, has been condemned by activists.

Basic economic factors also loom large. This year, analysts expect that many overleveraged oil firms in West Texas will likely go bankrupt, and those that stay afloat will face withering headwinds. Production of low-cost shale oil means some established companies will need to continue to reassess their portfolio to turn a profit. Meanwhile, both geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and disagreements over trade continue to rattle the industry: global operations require safely and efficiently moving vast amounts of oil across borders.

Despite the gathering momentum to wean the economy off fossil fuels, we’re not there yet. Analysts predict oil will continue to dominate the global economy into the early 2030s. And even as this transition takes place, Big Oil will likely continue to wield outsize political influence. In the U.S., the coal industry is a shadow of what it once was as companies struggle to turn a profit, but the Trump Administration continues to work on behalf of its barons.

Oil executives would, at any rate, prefer to avoid coal’s fate. In his office in the Hague, van Beurden considers the uncertainty facing his company over the next decade: souring public perception, shifting consumer behavior, the risk of becoming activist investors’ next target, political leaders’ bold promises to dramatically reduce emissions. In this environment, van Beurden says, companies like Shell must be ready to adapt. “It’s the time we live in,” he says. “I have to find a way to make the most of that.”

How do we know it’s a fraud?

Always watch what people do, not what they say.

The elites who peddle man-made climate-change DO NOT BEHAVE as if they actually believe earth’s temperatures are rising, which leads to the melting of polar ice, which then leads to rising oceans and the erosion of coastlines. (Did you know that Al Gore predicted the North Pole would be ice-free by 2016?) For if they actually believe that, they would not:

(1) Travel in carbon-spewing private jets and yachts (see “Hypocrisy on steroids: Global elite take private jets & super-yachts to Google Climate Summit“, “Eco-hypocrites:Prince Harry & Meghan took private jet to Ibiza for 5-day vacation,” “Hollyweird hypocrite Emma Thompson flies 5,400+ miles to protest climate change“), while the “little people” are told to foresake flying in crowded commercial airlines by the likes of Alexandrio Ocasio-Cortez, Alex Baldwin, and the new UK movement Flygskam.

(2) Buy ocean-front property that would fall into the seas as the coastline is eroded by rising sea-levels from the melting of polar ice. Case in point:

In 2015, Barack Obama told the United Nations that climate change was the greatest threat against humanity’s future, particularly for those living close to the ocean. As reported by Timothy Meads for Townhall, Obama said:

No nation, however large or small, wealthy or poor, can escape the impact of climate change. Rising sea levels threaten every coastline. More powerful storms and floods threaten every continent. More frequent droughts and crop failures breed hunger and conflict in places where hunger and conflict already thrive. On shrinking islands, families are already being forced to flee their homes as climate refugees.

A week ago, on August 23, 2019, the same Barack Obama purchased a $15 million luxurious, ocean-front summer home in Martha’s Vineyard, despite the UN’s dire warning that earth has only 12 years left until the point of no return.

Multiple island sources tell us the Obamas are in escrow for the estate owned by Boston Celtics owner, Wyc Grousbeck. The former Prez and First Lady have been renting the house this summer and loved it so much, we’ve learned they made an offer. The property is listed at $14,850,000. Our sources say they’re paying less, but we don’t know how much. The estate — incredible. It’s 29 beachfront acres. The main residence is just shy of 6,900 square feet. It has 7 bedrooms, so Sasha and Malia have a place to crash, along with several of their friends. It has the obligatory pool, an outdoor fireplace, a chef’s kitchen, vaulted ceilings and 2 guest wings. It has incredible views, especially while soaking in the second-floor balcony Jacuzzi.

1108,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's move to begin pulling out of the Paris Agreement last month signaled to world leaders that the US government is stepping away from the global push to stop the climate crisis .

But as world leaders gather in Madrid this week to refine their pledges to cut heat-trapping gases, a large group of US cities, states, universities and businesses remain committed to holding global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.

Their message to the world? That the US is still fighting to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.

And despite the policies of this administration, a new report shows that this broad coalition is significantly reducing US greenhouse gas emissions and even deeper cuts are possible with or without federal help.

The report titled ""Accelerating America's Pledge"" finds that policies already in place by state, local and business actors can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.

This current coalition of the willing represents 68% of US gross domestic product, which would make it the world's second largest economy, second to only the US economy itself, according to the report.

""We can say to the international community, 'Hey, you guys hear a lot about what's not happening in the US, but what you might not know is that there is a tremendous amount of activity that can actually make a difference in terms of overall US emissions,'"" said Nate Hultman, director of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland and the lead author of the report.

The authors of the report -- which was produced by the ""America's Pledge"" initiative led by Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg and former California Gov. Jerry Brown -- found that even more significant cuts are possible with further shifts toward renewable energy, improved efficiency in buildings and transportation, and protection of forests and other carbon-storing ecosystems.

If state and local governments along with the private sector further enhanced their climate commitments, overall US emissions could fall even further by 37% by 2030, the study found.

But the report shows that to get the US within striking distance of its Paris Agreement goals, executive and legislative action will be required.

Mixed messages from the US on climate change

The report comes as state and local actors try to carry on the fight to halt climate change without federal support and reflects both the potential and limits of this current bifurcated US climate policy.

But there is a second group from the US in Madrid -- a band of lawmakers, city and state officials, plus private sector and educational leaders -- seeking to fill the void of leadership they say has been left by the Trump administration.

Their goal is to convince the rest of the world that the US is still in the fight to avert the worst consequences of climate change.

On Friday, the US Climate Action Center opened in Madrid with a slate of speakers and events. During COP25, the action center will serve as a hub for an array of US leaders planning to show other countries the steps they are taking to combat the climate crisis.

""Throughout the course of history, the US has been seen as a leader. And with an issue as pressing as this one, we shouldn't take a backseat to anybody,"" said Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is representing the US Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of governors committed to the Paris Agreement goals.

In the absence of federal action to address the climate crisis, this has become the new normal.

At the past two major gatherings of climate negotiators (COP23 and COP24) since Trump came into office, this alliance has set up shop on the sidelines --separate from the federal delegation.

""One of the major concerns I think is the way that the US has participated in these talks -- being in and being out, and then being in and being out,"" said Elan Strait, director of US climate campaigns at the World Wildlife Fund. ""The rest of the world is obviously very tired of that.""

Both in the US presidential election and at next year's COP26 in Glasgow, the stakes are high when it comes to the fate of the planet.

The Madrid meetings this week are the last major negotiations before 2020, the year when the Paris agreement goes into effect.

Ahead of COP26, many countries will need to increase their commitments to cut emissions to get on track to meet the Paris goals.

Though the US has formally withdrawn from the Paris accord, under the agreement's framework, the process cannot be completed until November 4, 2020, which happens to be the day after the 2020 presidential election.

Should Trump lose, a new president could rejoin the agreement, but would need to commit the US to cutting its heat-trapping gas emissions even further.",mainstream,M0b310,climate.change; global.warming
1169,"Few people would choose to be marooned on a vast expanse of sea ice at the onset of Arctic winter, but this past fall Jessie Creamean was delighted to spend nine weeks aboard a vessel that had been deliberately frozen into an ice cap near the top of the world. On Mondays, she wrapped herself in several layers, including a heavy-duty parka and bulky orange boots with superinsulated soles, and ventured into the polar darkness. Driving snowmobiles loaded with equipment, she and her fellow researchers, on alert for cracks and fissures, caravanned over the jagged surface of the ice.

After setting up a tent as a partial shield against the wind and bitter cold, and wearing red-filtered headlamps to avoid disturbing light-sensitive microbes, the researchers used a battery-powered drill fitted with a spinning circular blade and a three-foot-long barrel to draw about two dozen cores out of the ice. For the next several hours they carefully sliced the cores into sections, calling out precise measurements for Creamean to record. Outside the tent stood a guard armed with a rifle and a flare gun, scanning the horizon for approaching polar bears.

Creamean, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University, is one of more than 300 researchers participating in a wildly ambitious, eye-wateringly expensive yearlong expedition called MOSAiC, the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate. The observatory in question is the expedition’s research vessel, a German icebreaker called the Polarstern, which set sail from Norway last September. When the Polarstern reached Arctic waters, the researchers chose an ice floe that they believed was thick and sturdy enough to last through the summer, then moored the ship to the floe and waited for the ice to freeze around it. The Polarstern and its floe are now indeed drifting across the Arctic Ocean, and if all goes well, they will continue to do so until the expedition ends in September 2020. The researchers hail from more than 70 institutions across 20 countries, and like the polar explorers of old they are driven to understand one of the planet’s grandest, most mysterious and least hospitable regions.

But this is an Arctic their predecessors would barely recognize—and that is precisely the point of the expedition. Over the past three decades, the extent of Arctic sea ice in September, at the end of the summer melt, has declined by 30 percent. Since 2002, the record low for summer ice has been broken four times, and several other recent years have come close to setting new records. Scientists believe this is in part because the dark ocean surface absorbs more heat from the sun than sea ice does, which is contributing to a worrisome feedback loop—warming leads to melting ice, which leads to more warming—promising more and swifter melting in the future.

Because the Arctic plays such an important role in cooling the planet, MOSAiC’s goal is to understand how the ice, atmosphere and ocean are interacting in a warming Arctic, and how those dynamics affect climate around the globe. One group of MOSAiC researchers is studying the currents that move seawater in and out of the Arctic, and how ocean temperatures affect atmospheric conditions as well as the freezing and melting of ice. Some are studying the cracks and gaps that form in the ice as temperatures warm. Others are gauging the levels of greenhouse gases in the ocean and atmosphere. In addition, research aircraft were scheduled to begin flights from Svalbard, Norway, in mid-March to complement atmospheric measurements on the ice, but they were delayed after a German-based team member tested positive for COVID-19. (There is no indication that anybody on the ship was exposed.)

MOSAiC researchers are also studying the tiny organisms that live on the ice and in the surrounding sea, and Creamean is especially interested in these life-forms. During her time on the Polarstern, she studied microbes in Arctic ice and seawater she collected, measuring the minuscule amounts of methane and other gases the microbes digest or produce during their life cycles. She also collected air samples to study how algae, bacteria and other particles blown into the air act as nuclei for ice crystals in the atmosphere, “seeding” the formation of Arctic clouds—clouds that in turn affect the amounts of snow and sunlight that reach the sea ice.

The work poses countless challenges. Fissures can form in the ice and block the way to established research sites, forcing the researches to find alternative routes. The temperatures plummeted to 20 degrees below zero. In mid-November, a violent storm opened up a new crack between the Polarstern and its floe, knocking over a 100-foot meteorological tower and threatening to snap power cables. But spirits remained high, according to Creamean, sustained by the international camaraderie and even the occasional soccer game on the ice.

During long hours in the ice-coring tent, Creamean would occasionally step outside and gaze at the moon or the stars and try to take in the vastness of the Arctic night. “Sometimes the blowing snow would sparkle, and you’d just be struck by the beauty of it all,” she says. “To know that you were one of the very few people who had ever seen that, who had ever stepped foot up there—it was awe-inspiring.”

In early January, Creamean flew home to Colorado hauling an Igloo cooler packed with samples of Arctic seawater, ice and air. Over the coming months, she’ll identify the bacteria, phytoplankton and other microorganisms in her samples from their DNA. Then, she’ll mimic the process of cloud formation in her lab, watching to see which kinds of microbes most readily seed clouds at subzero temperatures. Later, she’ll repeat the process with samples brought back from the Polarstern during spring, summer and fall to observe how the makeup of the atmosphere changes as temperatures warm, the ice melts, and microbes in the surface water are blown into the air. Eventually, she hopes to pin down the precise role microbes in the melting ice play in the formation of the clouds. “It’s a small piece of the puzzle, but it’s a crucial one,” she says. “If we can better understand how clouds form, we can better understand how Arctic weather and climate is affected by different processes—and how those changes will affect all of us.”",mainstream,M0ee2c,climate.change
1314,"Progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will co-chair a panel advising Joe Biden on climate policy as the apparent Democratic nominee takes steps to unify the party, it was announced on Wednesday.

Biden said that Ocasio-Cortez is on one of the six policy panels in comments to Las Vegas CBS affiliate KLAS-TV on Tuesday, when the former vice president was asked what he was doing to bring supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders into the fold.

""We've made some changes, we've listened to the Bernie supporters and, you know, for example, we have congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, she is on one of the panels as well,"" Biden said. ""And so I think we're going to have a very united party.""

In a joint statement announcing participants of the six “Unity Task Forces” released by Biden and Sanders on Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez is listed as a co-chair of the climate change task force along with Biden endorser, former Secretary of State John Kerry. The former 2004 presidential candidate and senator notably created the Paris Climate Agreement struck between numerous countries under the Obama administration.

Ocasio-Cortez, who had endorsed Bernie Sanders months before he dropped out of the race in April, will be serving as Sanders' representative on the committee convened by Biden dealing with climate policy, her spokeswoman said.

""She made the decision with members of the Climate Justice community — and she will be fully accountable to them and the larger advocacy community during this process,"" spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said in an email.

Hitt said that Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., ""believes the movement will only be successful if we continue to apply pressure both inside and outside the system,"" and added that ""this is just one element of the broader fight for just policies.”

Other notable names serving on that task force are healthcare co-chairs Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and former Obama era Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who has briefed Biden daily on the covid-19 pandemic. The Obama administration’s Attorney General Eric Holder will serve on criminal justice, which is chaired by Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., whose SAFE Justice Act Biden has long championed on the campaign trail.

The six task forces were created last month after Sanders formally dropped out of the race to ensure that Biden could win over key coalitions of his progressive supporters as he mobilizes to beat President Donald Trump with a united Democratic front. The groups will meet ahead of the Democratic National Convention to shape policy for the convention platform committee and Biden’s agenda.

“A united party is key to defeating Donald Trump this November and moving our country forward through an unprecedented crisis. As we work toward our shared goal, it is especially critical that we not lose sight of the pressing issues facing Americans,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday.

Sanders echoed the sentiment, commending Biden “for working together with my campaign to assemble a group of leading thinkers and activists who can and will unify our party in a transformational and progressive direction.""

Sanders, I-Vt., ended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on April 8, and at the time the pledged to have significant influence over the party platform. Sanders went on to officially endorse Biden for president less than a week later.

Biden, in the Tuesday interview with KLAS, which was done over the internet amid the coronavirus pandemic, referenced the Sanders' endorsement.

The former vice president also seemed to suggest that Sanders' supporters may have gotten the wrong idea about his positions during the campaign.

467,"Migration pressures from conflict, religious persecution and economic causes already cause headaches in Europe and elsewhere, but now the UN has decided that climate change could be yet another reason not to repatriate a migrant.

In the years to come, as climate change continues to bear the blame for everything from bushfires, drought, hurricanes, biblical-style rainfall and even record snowfall, we might just look back at a recent United Nations ruling as the tipping point for the greatest-ever global migration shift.

For the UN has put the developed world on notice, and let’s be frank, it is those prosperous nations they are lecturing to that refugees will have a right to be relocated to from their drought-stricken, water-logged or hurricane-devastated home countries if the conditions at home subject their human rights to a violation.

What exactly constitutes climate change in a legal sense here is anyone’s guess, but that’s not a problem for the UN to consider, as it has just kicked that particular can down the road for those nations besieged by climate migrants in, say 2035, to deal with.

The judgement was made after the (unsuccessful) claim of Ioane Teitiota, a man from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, a collection of 33 islands threatened by rising sea levels who had applied for protection in New Zealand in 2013, claiming his and his family’s lives were at risk. Mr Teitiota was already deported from New Zealand in 2015.

The New Zealand courts rejected his claim, and the UN human rights committee upheld its decision saying there was time for Kiribati and the international community to take affirmative action and relocate its population but – and there was a big ‘but’ – the future effects of climate change evident in some countries could mean it would be considered a violation of a migrant’s human rights – thus illegal – to be returned home by a nation in which they were seeking to enter.

This is the sort of ruling that gives leaders and policymakers in the nations of southern Europe in particular, as well as those further north, sleepless nights. Did someone say “build a wall”?

They see decisions being made about far-away lands that will have a sledgehammer impact on their own people in the not-too-distant future.

For many governments, it is hard enough determining who is and who isn’t a legitimate refugee claiming protection from religious, sexual or racial discrimination. Clearly identifying the Chinese Muslims from the Sudanes Christians or transgender Afghans is tricky on its own. Now we have to take a potential migrant’s weather concerns into consideration?

Do years of drought – or is it years of flood – constitute a threat to someone’s human rights? Is the heavy rainfall on the coast of South America down to the effects of that regular menace El Nino, or something more long term happening on the polar ice caps?

While the world in general – excuse us, Mr President – is starting to identify many of the modern environmental phenomena as the results of global warming, scientists even now are still a little fuzzy about the particulars.

And there are so many issues to consider. There are sinking islands, like Kiribati and the Maldives, there are bushfires in Australia, there are summer heatwaves in Greece and unparalleled rainfall in northern England.

There are targets, declarations, denunciations, forums, committees, scientists, politicians, religious leaders and even Swedish teenagers all creating a massive incoherent clamour from which it is impossible to distill any one distinct message, apart from “we’re all gonna die,” which most of us know anyway.

And now we have the prospect of those experiencing unsettling weather extremes and looking to migrate being given UN support in seeking to move somewhere less volatile climatically.",conspiracy,C02ec2,climate.change
900,"Russia doesn't seem to care two bits about global warming, and it's not hard to see why. Most Russians would probably be happy if the country was a little warmer. Officials even joke that once climate change has run its course, people may start pouring into Siberia instead of trying to escape it. If the polar ice caps melt any further, Russia would be able to drill for oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean, where it's believed to have huge fossil-fuel reserves. For the rest of the planet, however, the picture is not so cheerful.

To say that Russia is hesitant about tackling climate change is putting it mildly. The last time the world tried to get the country's cooperation on the issue was in 1997, during negotiations for the Kyoto Protocol (the international treaty on limiting greenhouse-gas emissions). Because Russia is the world's third largest source of emissions after the U.S. and China, the accord would have failed without it. So the treaty was written in a way that would allow Russia to keep polluting as much as it wanted and grant the country billions of dollars in emissions allowances to sell to other countries that needed to meet their Kyoto commitments.

As a U.N. official who participated in the talks put it, ""Russia got the sweetest deal: free money, no restrictions."" But apparently even that wasn't enough. It took another seven years of painstaking negotiations  and promises from the West to help Russia join the World Trade Organization (WTO)  to get the country to ratify the deal.

How the world will persuade Russia to take an active part in the upcoming climate-change summit in Copenhagen on Dec. 2 remains to be seen. Scientists say this is the last real chance that global leaders have to deal with global warming before its effects become irreversible, and this time around there are few obvious carrots with which to bait the Kremlin. (Russia has since abandoned plans to join the WTO.) And Russia has already indicated that it is not putting a high priority on the talks. In June, President Dmitri Medvedev announced the country's emissions targets, which would effectively see Russia spew 30% more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by 2020 than it does today. ""We will not cut our development potential,"" Medvedev said at the time.

Then, at a preliminary round of climate talks in Copenhagen in late October, Russia sent an even more disappointing message. The head of the country's delegation, Mikhail Zelikhanov, a parliamentary deputy for Prime Minister Valdimir Putin's United Russia Party, questioned the basic premise of the fight against climate change. ""Scientific circles in Russia and elsewhere still do not have a united opinion on the causes of global warming,"" Zelikhanov told the group of lawmakers from 16 countries in the hall of the Danish parliament. He suggested that an international panel be created to study whether or not global warming was the result of human actions and whether it could be stopped by cutting pollution.

Zelikhanov is part of a growing chorus of global-warming skeptics in Russia. At a climate conference in St. Petersburg in 2007, Sergei Mironov, the speaker of the upper house of parliament, told experts that a process of ""global cooling"" was in fact taking place. As evidence, he cited the paintings of the 16th century Dutch masters, whose warmly colored landscapes, he said, showed that temperatures were indeed higher back then. And last month, the state-run Channel One television station aired a documentary called The History of a Deception: Global Warming, which claimed that a media conspiracy had invented the idea that pollution is to blame for climate change.

None of this bodes especially well for the success of the December summit. ""It will not be possible to finalize an agreement without the participation of Russia,"" says Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen, who is spearheading the negotiations. ""We will need to engage Russia in this dialogue."" This might be possible through concessions, though. Last month, Denmark put itself on Moscow's good side when it became the first country to approve the construction of Russia's Nord Stream gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea. On Nov. 2, Rasmussen received a sign of support from Putin on climate change, albeit a slightly vague one. ""Are we ready to support Danish efforts to promote the ideas of the post-Kyoto period? Yes, we are,"" Putin said at a joint press conference with Rasmussen.

A European official involved in the negotiations says Russia's fear of isolation may also compel it to cooperate. With the U.S. and China taking the lead in the climate-change summit and Brazil and India playing an active role, Russia would be the largest polluter and the only major power not helping to solve the crisis. ""They won't want to be the bad guy,"" says the official, who spoke last month in Copenhagen on condition of anonymity.

But another member of the Russian delegation at the October talks left little room for optimism. Elena Chistyakova, chief adviser to the parliament's foreign affairs committee, says Russia may sign the treaty  and that's it. ""[Russia] will drag out the ratification as long as they can. And if they ratify it, then they'll drag out the implementation,"" she says. ""There's just no political will.""

581,"Refugees fleeing their native countries due to the effects of the climate crisis in future years may not be forced to return if their lives are in danger, the United Nations Human Rights Committee said in a ruling Monday. The committee anticipates a flood of ""millions"" of climate refugees in the near future.

The first-of-its-kind ruling — which a U.N. official called ""powerfully symbolic"" —came in the case of Ioane Teitiota, who applied for protection in New Zealand in 2013. Teitiota claimed his family's lives were at risk in his home nation of Kiribati, a country severely threatened by rising sea levels. And while he actually lost his case, the U.N. committee took the opportunity to make a broader statement about climate refugees.

The situation in Tarawa, Teitiota's home island, ""has become increasingly unstable and precarious due to sea-level rise caused by global warming,"" his counsel said. Saltwater contamination and overcrowding on the island have resulted in scarce freshwater resources and a growing housing crisis.

In 1947, South Tarawa was home to just 1,671 people. In 2010, its population surpassed 50,000 after nearby islands became uninhabitable. By 2017, Kiribati's population had soared to over 100,000 people.

Additionally, storm surges and high tides have flooded residential areas. The population of the island suffers from vitamin deficiencies, malnutrition, fish poisoning and other ailments resulting from food insecurity. Unemployment has surged in the region and diseases spread easily through overcrowding and poor quality drinking water.

""Kiribati has thus become an untenable and violent environment for the author and his family,"" the case argued. Scientists warn it could become uninhabitable within decades.

Teitota applied for refugee status in New Zealand after his visa expired in 2010. He was forced to return to Kiribati in September 2015 — putting his life and the lives of his family at risk, he said.

Teitota's application was rejected, but he appealed, claiming the ruling violated his right to life. New Zealand's Court of Appeal and Supreme Court each denied subsequent appeals, so he filed a complaint with the U.N.'s Human Rights Committee.

On Monday, the U.N. committee issued its judgment in the case. It ruled against Teitota — stating his life was not in immediate risk — but said that people in places where climate change poses an immediate threat to their lives could not be forced to return.

""The timeframe of 10 to 15 years, as suggested by the author, could allow for intervening acts by the Republic of Kiribati, with the assistance of the international community, to take affirmative measures to protect and, where necessary, relocate its population,"" the ruling said.

In the future, if the climate crisis continues, governments may be prohibited from sending people back to home countries that pose immediate threats to life due to climate change, the committee held, and potential human rights violations caused by climate change should be taken into account by nations considering the deportation of asylum seekers.

""Without robust national and international efforts, the effects of climate change in receiving states may expose individuals to a violation of their rights,"" the ruling said, citing articles 6 and 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ensuring people's inherent right to life.

While Kiribati's current situation was not enough to meet the standards of an immediate threat to life, the decision could become significant as the number of climate refugees is projected to increase.

""The decision sets a global precedent,"" said Kate Schuetze, Pacific researcher at Amnesty International. ""It says a state will be in breach of its human rights obligations if it returns someone to a country where — due to the climate crisis — their life is at risk, or in danger of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.""

However, the ruling ""would not apply to U.S. asylum decisions at this point, because the court ruled against the claimant,"" reports CBS News' Pamela Falk, ""but it opens the door to courts hearing climate claims in the future.""

""It is powerfully symbolic,"" a U.N. official told Falk.

The U.N. expects tens of millions of people to be displaced due to the climate crisis in the next decade alone. A 2018 World Bank report predicted that 143 million people from South Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa could be forced to migrate due to climate conditions by 2050.

""The message is clear: Pacific Island states do not need to be underwater before triggering human rights obligations to protect the right to life,"" said Schuetze.

At the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told Reuters that the ruling has broad implications for governments.

""The ruling says if you have an immediate threat to your life due to climate change, due to the climate emergency, and if you cross the border and go to another country, you should not be sent back, because you would be at risk of your life, just like in a war or in a situation of persecution,"" Grandi said.

Wildfires, rising sea levels, crop destruction and floods are just a few of the results of the climate crisis that could drive large numbers of people from their homes.

""We must be prepared for a large surge of people moving against their will,"" he said. ""I wouldn't venture to talk about specific numbers, it's too speculative, but certainly we're talking about millions here.""",mainstream,M09bfd,climate.change
977,"The ongoing climate crisis is on course to destroy half the world's sandy beaches by the end of the century, a new study warns.

Sandy shorelines of many high-population areas and tourist hot-spots are threatened by erosion, climate change and surging sea levels.

At-risk areas include Surfers' Paradise in Queensland, St Tropez, Honolulu, Copacabana, the Costa del Sol and Weymouth.

But researchers offer a glimmer of hope and believe a moderate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could prevent 40 per cent of the predicted loss.

Researchers from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in Ispra in northern Italy analysed 30 years worth of satellite images of sandy beaches.

Study author Dr Michalis Vousdoukas, who led the research, said: 'The results indicate around 50 per cent of the world's sandy beaches are at risk of severe erosion.

'Half of the world's beaches could disappear by the end of the century under current trends of climate change and sea level rise.

'The situation can become more critical for small communities highly reliant on tourism.'

Sandy beaches occupy more than a third of the global coastline and are valuable in many ways as they provide economic income via recreation and tourism.

They are also very environmentally valuable as they provide natural protection from storms and cyclones.

However, erosion, sea level rises and changing weather threaten the coast's infrastructure and people.

Some countries will be worse hit than others, with The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau facing the loss of over 60 per cent of their white sandy beaches.

Overall, Australia would be worst hit with around 7,500 miles (12,000 km ) of beach at risk.

Canada, Chile, Mexico, China and the United States would also be greatly affected.

'Between a quarter and a half of the UK's sandy beaches will retreat by more than a hundred metres over the next century, depending on how rapidly the polar ice sheets melt,' according to Professor Andrew Shepherd, Director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds.

The researchers used computer modelling systems to forecast how the beaches, in their currently depleted state, would deteriorate as climate change worsens.

Two eventualities of 'representative concentration pathways (RCP)' for global warming were predicted, each representing a future of varying severity.

RCP8.5 is the highest level of projected greenhouse gas emissions and RCP4.5 features less intense emissions that span over a long period of time.

Researchers looked at how human activity and geological processes causes shoreline retreat as well as the damage caused by storms to make their findings.

Dr Suzana Ilic at Lancaster University said: 'This new research shows that about 30 per cent and 60 per cent of low lying areas fronted by sandy beaches will be seriously threatened by erosion, due to climate change under the high emission of greenhouse gases by the middle and the end of the 21st century respectively.'

Moderate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may prevent 40 per cent of this loss, the study authors suggest.

Dr Ilic, who was not involved in the study, added: 'It is encouraging to see that reducing emissions from a high to moderate level will result in a reduction of the projected shoreline retreat of 22 per cent by 2050 and 40 per cent by 2100.'

155,"Globally, the number of reported weather-related natural disasters has more than tripled since the 1960s. Every year, these disasters result in over 60 000 deaths, mainly in developing countries.

Rising sea levels and increasingly extreme weather events will destroy homes, medical facilities and other essential services. More than half of the world's population lives within 60 km of the sea. People may be forced to move, which in turn heightens the risk of a range of health effects, from mental disorders to communicable diseases.

Increasingly variable rainfall patterns are likely to affect the supply of fresh water. A lack of safe water can compromise hygiene and increase the risk of diarrhoeal disease, which kills approximately 760 000 children aged under 5, every year. In extreme cases, water scarcity leads to drought and famine. By the late 21st century, climate change is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of drought at regional and global scale1.

Floods are also increasing in frequency and intensity, and the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation is expected to continue to increase throughout the current century1. Floods contaminate freshwater supplies, heighten the risk of water-borne diseases, and create breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects such as mosquitoes. They also cause drownings and physical injuries, damage homes and disrupt the supply of medical and health services.

1329,"Charles Dickens was a British novelist, journalist, editor, illustrator and social commentator who wrote such beloved classic novels as Oliver Twist, A Christmas Carol, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield, A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations.

Dickens is remembered as one of the most important and influential writers of the 19th century. Among his accomplishments, he has been lauded for providing a stark portrait of the Victorian-era underclass, helping to bring about social change.

Dickens was born Charles John Huffam Dickens on February 7, 1812, in Portsmouth, on the southern coast of England.

The famed British author was the second of eight children. His father, John Dickens, was a naval clerk who dreamed of striking it rich. Charles' mother, Elizabeth Barrow, aspired to be a teacher and school director.

Despite his parents’ best efforts, the family remained poor. Nevertheless, they were happy in the early days. In 1816, they moved to Chatham, Kent, where young Dickens and his siblings were free to roam the countryside and explore the old castle at Rochester.

In 1822, the Dickens family moved to Camden Town, a poor neighborhood in London. By then the family’s financial situation had grown dire, as John Dickens had a dangerous habit of living beyond the family’s means. Eventually, John was sent to prison for debt in 1824, when Charles was just 12 years old.

Following his father’s imprisonment, Dickens was forced to leave school to work at a boot-blacking factory alongside the River Thames. At the run-down, rodent-ridden factory, Dickens earned six shillings a week labeling pots of “blacking,” a substance used to clean fireplaces. It was the best he could do to help support his family.

Looking back on the experience, Dickens saw it as the moment he said goodbye to his youthful innocence, stating that he wondered “how [he] could be so easily cast away at such a young age.”

He felt abandoned and betrayed by the adults who were supposed to take care of him. These sentiments would later become a recurring theme in his writing.

Much to his relief, Dickens was permitted to go back to school when his father received a family inheritance and used it to pay off his debts.

But when Dickens was 15, his education was pulled out from under him once again. In 1827, he had to drop out of school and work as an office boy to contribute to his family’s income. As it turned out, the job became a launching point for his writing career.

Within a year of being hired, Dickens began freelance reporting at the law courts of London. Just a few years later, he was reporting for two major London newspapers.

In 1833, he began submitting sketches to various magazines and newspapers under the pseudonym “Boz.” In 1836, his clippings were published in his first book, Sketches by Boz.

In the same year, Dickens started publishing The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club. His series, originally written as captions for artist Robert Seymour’s humorous sports-themed illustrations, took the form of monthly serial installments.

The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club was wildly popular with readers. In fact, Dickens’ captions were even more popular than the illustrations they were meant to accompany.

He later edited magazines including Household Words and All the Year Round, the latter of which he founded.

Dickens married Catherine Hogarth soon after his first book, Sketches by Boz, was published. The couple had a brood of 10 children.

During the 1850s, Dickens suffered two devastating losses: the deaths of his daughter and father. He also separated from his wife in 1858. Dickens slandered Catherine publicly, and struck up an intimate relationship with a young actress named Ellen ""Nelly"" Ternan.

Sources differ on whether the two started seeing each other before or after Dickens' marital separation; it is also believed that he went to great lengths to erase any documentation alluding to Ternan's presence in his life.

Throughout his career, Dickens published a total of 15 novels. His most well-known works include:

Oliver Twist, Dickens first novel, follows the life of an orphan living in the streets. The book was inspired by how Dickens felt as an impoverished child forced to get by on his wits and earn his own keep.

As publisher of a magazine called Bentley’s Miscellany, Dickens began publishing Oliver Twist in installments between February 1837 and April 1838, with the full book edition published in November 1838.

Dickens continued showcasing Oliver Twist in the magazines he later edited, including Household Words and All the Year Round. The novel was extremely well-received in both England and America. Dedicated readers of Oliver Twist eagerly anticipated the next monthly installment.

On December 19, 1843, Dickens published A Christmas Carol. The book features the timeless protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge, a curmudgeonly old miser, who, with the help of ghosts, finds the Christmas spirit.

Dickens penned the book in just six weeks, beginning in October and finishing just in time for the holiday celebrations. The novel was intended as a social criticism, to bring attention to the hardships faced by England’s poorer classes.

The book was a roaring success, selling more than 6,000 copies upon publication. Readers in England and America were touched by the book’s empathetic emotional depth; one American entrepreneur reportedly gave his employees an extra day’s holiday after reading it. Despite literary criticism, the book remains one of Dickens’ most well-known and beloved works.

'Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son' (1846 to 1848)

From October 1846 to April 1848, Dickens published, in monthly installments, Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son. The novel, which was published in book form in 1848, centers on the theme of how business tactics affect a family’s personal finances.

Taking a dark view of England, it is considered pivotal to Dickens’ body of work in that it set the tone for his other novels.

David Copperfield was the first work of its kind: No one had ever written a novel that simply followed a character through his everyday life. From May 1849 to November 1850, Dickens published the book in monthly installations, with the full novel form published in November 1850.

In writing it, Dickens tapped into his own personal experiences, from his difficult childhood to his work as a journalist. Although David Copperfield is not considered Dickens’ best work, it was his personal favorite. It also helped define the public’s expectations of a Dickensian novel.

Following the death of his father and daughter and separation from his wife, Dickens’ novels began to express a darkened worldview.

In Bleak House, published in installments from 1852 to 1853, he deals with the hypocrisy of British society. It was considered his most complex novel to date.

Hard Times takes place in an industrial town at the peak of economic expansion. Published in 1854, the book focuses on the shortcomings of employers as well as those who seek change.

Coming out of his “dark novel” period, in 1859 Dickens published A Tale of Two Cities, a historical novel that takes place during the French Revolution in Paris and London. He published it in a periodical he founded, All the Year Round.

The story focuses on themes of the need for sacrifice, the struggle between the evils inherent in oppression and revolution, and the possibility of resurrection and rebirth.

Great Expectations, published in serial form between December 1860 to August 1861 and in novel form in October 1861, is widely considered Dickens’ greatest literary accomplishment.

The story, Dickens’ second to be narrated in the first person, focuses on the lifelong journey of moral development for the novel’s protagonist, an orphan named Pip. With extreme imagery and colorful characters, the well-received novel’s themes include wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and good versus evil.

After the publication of Oliver Twist, Dickens struggled to match the level of its success. From 1838 to 1841, he published The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, The Old Curiosity Shop and Barnaby Rudge.

Another novel from Dickens’ darker period is Little Dorrit (1857), a fictional study of how human values come in conflict with the world’s brutality. Dickens’ novel Our Mutual Friend, published in serial form between 1864 to 1865 before being published as a book in 1865, analyzes the psychological impact of wealth on London society.

Travels to the United States and Italy

In 1842, Dickens and his wife, Catherine, embarked on a five-month lecture tour of the United States. Upon their return, Dickens penned American Notes for General Circulation, a sarcastic travelogue criticizing American culture and materialism.

Around this time he also wrote The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit, a story about a man’s struggle to survive on the ruthless American frontier.

During his first U.S. tour, in 1842, Dickens spoke of his opposition to slavery and expressed his support for additional reform. His lectures, which began in Virginia and ended in Missouri, were so widely attended that ticket scalpers gathered outside his events. Biographer J.B. Priestley wrote that during the tour, Dickens enjoyed ""the greatest welcome that probably any visitor to America has ever had.”

“They flock around me as if I were an idol,” bragged Dickens, a known show-off. Although he enjoyed the attention at first, he eventually resented the invasion of privacy. He was also annoyed by what he viewed as Americans’ gregariousness and crude habits, as he later expressed in American Notes.

After his criticism of the American people during his first tour, Dickens launched a second U.S. tour, from 1867 to 1868, hoping to set things right with the public.

This time, he made a charismatic speech promising to praise the United States in reprints of American Notes for General Circulation and The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit. His 75 readings netted an estimated $95,000, which, in the Victorian era, amounted to approximately $1.5 million in current U.S. dollars.

Back at home, Dickens had become so famous that people recognized him all over London as he strolled around the city, collecting the observations that would serve as inspiration for his future work.

Dickens also spent significant time in Italy, resulting in his 1846 travelogue Pictures from Italy.",mainstream,M0eb8c,climate.change
582,"Former frontline CIA Officer Scott Uehlinger says Hillary Clinton clearly broke the law with her private unprotected server. Uehlinger explains, “What the Clintons rely on is most Americans don’t really understand the security procedures. So, they can throw up a lot of smoke and mirrors that confuses people and makes them think that this was not so much of a problem. But people in the military and people in the intelligence community understand this better, and certainly it is even worse than it appears. . . . The fact that she set up a private server, in and of itself, means she is guilty of a felony right there. Obviously, by having a private server, she was conspiring to evade her signed sworn statements that she would uphold secrecy agreements. The fact that she simply established that (private server) regardless of what was on it, she intended to go around and circumvent the law. Now, we had more than 100 highly classified emails on the server, and the fact that this server is absolutely vulnerable to any Chinese, Russian or Iranian hacking, this is the greatest disaster or mishandling of classified information at the upper levels of the U.S. government in history. There is no question about it.”

Does Uehlinger think Clinton’s private server was hacked? Uehlinger says, “I would virtually guarantee that with 95% certainty it was hacked. There is almost no question about it.”

What about the mishandling of classified information that General David Petraeus plead guilty to last year? Is this the same level of security breach? Uehlinger says, “We don’t know exactly what he gave out, but there has been talk in the press that his schedule was given out. People of that level, even their schedules are classified information. We cannot even begin to compare the damage of General Petraeus’ schedule, which is obsolete after a week or so, compared to highly sensitive information (on Clinton’s private server) that involve U.S. technical means . . . that’s so high in classification that the FBI agents investigating her case were not allowed to see. This is a quantum leap in mishandling of classified information far and above anything that Petraeus did, and look at what was done to him, and compare that to the present inaction going on with Hillary Clinton’s case.”

On Iran’s recent public push for ballistic missile development, Uehlinger, who is a 20 year CIA veteran and is an expert on Russia and Iran, says, “None of this is a surprise to people like us. However, this is a surprise to this administration, which just has a willful blindness and an ideology it sticks to and doesn’t want to hear anything to the contrary. They wanted to conclude something with Iran, and it was done, even though all evidence pointing to this would be a disaster. It’s an absolute disaster. It’s unconscionable that you can have a non-agreement agreement and release money seized by the international community since 1979 . . . and unfreeze that, and the Iranians have admitted they are going to use some of that money for terrorist activity. They are progressing with their missile activity and threatening the United States for daring to criticize them. . . .They are going to increase the chances for war in the Middle East, not decrease it.”

Uehlinger, who is also running to be a Republican delegate in Pennsylvania, says Hillary not being charged may be to the advantage of the GOP come November. Uehlinger explains, “I have talked to some whose fear, their fear is that she will be charged. If this happened at the 11th hour, what might happen is Biden might be put up. I know people who have greater fear of Biden running against either Cruz or Trump than Hillary. It might be the best thing for the Republican Party for Hillary to remain where she is as a candidate because she can be defeated.”

1134,"There is a strange contradiction at the heart of our federal government and its response to climate change. While most of Washington has been woefully neglectful of the crisis or outright denying its existence, what is arguably our most conservative institution — the U.S. military — has begun taking the crisis very seriously. GOP legislators might make nonsensical statements about how “sea level rise” is a “left-wing term,” but the Pentagon is well aware of the dangers that climate change — which it refers to as a ‘threat multiplier’ — poses for its installations and mission. After all, you “can’t fight a war unless you’ve got a place to leave from,” noted General Gerald Galloway, formerly of the Army Corps of Engineers. As many as 46 U.S. military bases were recently deemed threatened by the heightened risk of flood, drought, and wildfire brought on by climate change.

Diving into the armed forces’ response to the climate crisis, Michael T. Klare “found they had some very interesting things to say about it.” Klare, 76, recently retired from Hampshire College, where he was the Five College Professor Emeritus of Peace and World Security Studies. (“Well, now I work even harder,” he laughs.) The author of 15 previous books and the defense correspondent for The Nation, Klare spoke with Rolling Stone about his forthcoming release, All Hell Breaking Loose: The Pentagon’s Perspective on Climate Change, which is due out this November from book publisher Metropolitan. The book synthesizes the latest government papers, statements and presentations by officials, along with personal interviews, to give the most up-to-date perspective on climate as viewed through the lens of those tasked with defending America from threats of all types.

Klare’s project began because he was “studying the intersections of climate change, resource scarcity, and conflict” and realized that the military’s take on global warming was a “vision of climate change that is not a part of the public discussion.” While environmentalists point out the ecological issues involved, like habitat destruction and mass extinctions, “the military focuses on the threat to human institutions and communities,” he says. The armed forces “see the greatest threats from climate change being state collapse and mass migrations that are going to create chaos around the world” and lead to a lot of dangerous tasks that “they would prefer not to have to undertake.”

The military began making some reforms to address climate change under the Obama administration, utilizing cleaner technologies through the Army’s Operation Dynamo, the Marines’ Experimental Forward Operating Base, and the Navy’s Great Green Fleet. Obama had put through an executive order in 2013 requiring all parts of the federal government to prepare for climate change, but Trump rescinded it in 2017. The various military branches continue to build toward ‘net zero‘ installations and the ability of each base to be self-reliant. “At some point, [military] officers who view national security as a sacred obligation will have no choice but to confront those who persist in climate denial,” writes Klare.

The president may think climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese, but Klare’s latest book shows that the Pentagon plans to stay the course in attempting to green its facilities, juggle multiple catastrophes at a time, and prepare for the possibility of, well, all hell breaking loose.

The idea of ‘All Hell Breaking Loose,’ in the title of your book, what does that mean for the military? 

They see their job as defending this country from foreign threats and that is what they are trained to do. ‘All Hell Breaking Loose’ is a condition they fear in which they will be unable to conduct that mission, to do their job, because they will be so caught up in protecting this country against climate change threats or addressing its impacts on other countries around the world that are collapsing because of the effects.

I take this concept from the Cold War era of nuclear escalation that says we go from small-scale events to increasingly serious ones. The military sees that with climate change as well. They

see an increase in extreme storm events that affect their allied countries and require a military response providing aid — and in the U.S. itself, like in Florida or Puerto Rico. But they look into the future and see increasingly severe events like extreme droughts bringing about the collapse of entire nations. They see that happening potentially in places like Nigeria and Pakistan, leading to mass chaos spreading across continents. They see that beginning in what we once called the Third World but spreading to more privileged and wealthier parts of the world like Europe, and bringing about upheaval there, leading eventually to conflict among the great powers as climate change advances. Perhaps in the

Can you quickly walk us through the ‘Ladder of Escalation’ model that you use for this book?

You write that the Pentagon began planning for what disaster experts call “complex emergencies” after the East Coast was walloped by Hurricane Sandy, and that it was the triple-assault of Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Harvey — combined with massive wildfires in the west — that “made the nightmare palpable” for officials. What is a complex emergency, and what do they mean to the Pentagon?

The U.S. Military has always played a role in the aftermath of emergencies, providing food, water, supplies, helping rescue people and more. That’s nothing new. But they find that as climate change advances and increases in intensity, these emergencies will become more complex. The electrical grid will collapse. There will be chemical spills that produce all kinds of health effects. The health system itself will collapse. The police services will collapse. And so the military will have to play a much greater role than they ever have before, stepping in and playing the various roles of governments and having to deal with lawlessness like looting.

In Puerto Rico, after Hurricane Maria, the systems of government basically crashed in many places. There was no electricity or communications available and the military came in and had to provide all of those services. There is a fear that in the future these kinds of emergencies, complex emergencies, will increase in severity and in number — and could occur simultaneously — requiring a vast commitment of military forces at a time when maybe those forces are needed elsewhere.

The book talks about how water systems will come under pressure because of climate change, which could give way to conflict. Any areas we should be particularly leery about?

Places like the countries of northern Africa are already suffering terribly and we see that currently with localized conflicts. But as climate change advances, even bigger and more wealthy and powerful countries will feel the effects. I think water is the area where this will play itself out — water shortages — and where two or more countries share the same source of water: the Nile River, the Indus River and so on.

One that has caught my attention is the Brahmaputra River. It originates in the Himalayas and travels hundreds of miles through China and Tibet and then crosses into northern India, where it continues for hundreds more miles and then finally crosses into Bangladesh, joins with the Ganges River and empties out into the Indian Ocean. This is one of the biggest and most important rivers in the world for agriculture — hundreds of millions of people depend on it for growing their food. This river is threatened by climate change because it derives from the Himalayian glaciers, which are going to disappear, and the river will likely diminish in flow. Meanwhile, China is threatening to dam the river upstream and divert its waters to parts of the country that are already suffering from water scarcity. And India says that that could be a cause for war because that river is so essential to the survival of their country that they won’t let it happen. So that is a scenario that worries me deeply.

What are the ties between the globalization of the economy, a global environmental system, and these complex emergencies? How do those intersections potentially affect things like pandemics?

First of all, climate change is making pandemics more likely because it improves the conditions for mosquitoes since they like hot, moist weather and that is what global warming is providing them with in large parts of the world — including the southeastern United States. We’re going to see more frequent pandemics in the future. Globalization helps that process due to the ease of airplane travel and whatnot — it can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases. I think this will create fears around the world, which will lead to quarantines, panics, and the militarization of health [services]. We’ve seen that at various stages in the past few years, like borders being sealed off. That attitude will lead to a more militarized response to climate change: fences, walls, and more. I don’t think you can solve climate change or health emergencies in this fashion, but I feel there will be a tendency to respond that way.

What about other aspects of globalization? Should the migrant caravans be viewed as climate refugees, and how should the U.S. respond?

This is a major political issue in the United States: How to address these massive migrations of desperate poor people from Central America who are fleeing violence and poverty and seeking refuge in the United States. The claim is that those people are economic refugees and should find refuge in an intermediate country, say Guatemala or Mexico. But it is pretty evident that climate change is a driving factor in their migration because of pronounced drought in much of the area. It’s becoming impossible to grow crops there and these are agricultural regions. So, yes, these people are fleeing climate change. I think as time goes on this type of thing can only become a more powerful factor in people’s decision to move. And there is going to be hostility to this process everywhere.

Many activists point out that the military has garrisoned the planet with bases and is the largest consumer of oil as a result. Is the government at all self-aware here?

Of course the military is a big consumer of oil, and that contributes to climate change. But this is something that people in the military are very aware of. They were drawn to this topic originally not by climate change but by the strategic implications of being all over the world and depending on a long logistical trail of getting that petroleum there. And that logistical trail is very vulnerable to attack. In Afghanistan and Iraq, U.S. oil convoys were attacked all the time. They still are. In many circumstances, more soldiers died defending convoys than died in battle. The military is very determined to reduce their dependence on fuel that may be subject to interference. It is also at risk from climate change because these long supply lines are increasingly going to be struck by severe weather events just like everything else will be.

So even before they had any kind of green consciousness, military leaders were determined to try to reduce the oil consumption of their forces. Now they are also concerned about climate change’s impacts on the global security environment, so they are also trying to reduce their own contribution to global warming. And they’re making some headway. Can they do more? Yes. They can do a lot more. But I think that they are showing that they’re capable of making progress in this direction.

Many people speak about a World War II-style mobilization to stop climate change through a Green New Deal and the like. But what does it say about our culture that people constantly think in these militarized analogies?

I think many people have difficulty with that notion, and I’m also ambivalent about whether a military metaphor is the right one. People sometimes do speak about the Apollo Project [the ambitious mission to get to the moon], which I find a more comfortable notion of what we have to do. The U.S. Military, when they speak about what they have to accomplish, does not speak in those terms. They say that ‘we have a job to do, which is to defend this country against foreign threats’ — very real military threats — ‘and that’s what we want to do.’ But climate change counts as an impediment to their real job and they have to address this and overcome it. And that means making its own bases resilient to climate change and reducing their contribution to it. But they recognize it as a global problem and realize they cannot do it alone and have to cooperate with the militaries of other countries in making their own countries resilient. So they see this as an area of military-to-military cooperation. I see it in a more positive light in that sense.

The now-retired Navy Admiral David Titley has mentioned a fear of ‘ungoverned spaces’ — why are such power vacuums abroad so important to the military and to the domestic security apparatus here at home?

The military talks about ‘ungoverned spaces’ as places where state control has vanished. You can think about a place like Somalia where you once had a functioning government that extended throughout the country but has long-since disappeared. You have something that calls itself a ‘government.’ Its reach doesn’t extend much beyond the city limits of Mogadishu. The rest of the country is pretty much ungoverned and you have lots of contending forces — various terrorist groups like Al-Shabab, militias and more. These are areas where groups like that can flourish and hatch plots against the United States.

Will this occur here? Certainly senior military officials in the U.S. fear that in the event of mass environmental catastrophes in the future, local governments will break down and there will be lawlessness in this country and the military will be forced to step in. They saw elements of that with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in New Orleans where the police force basically disintegrated and vanished.

The military says that with climate change, the number of these ungoverned spaces is going to multiply because states in Africa and elsewhere will not be able to cope with the intense droughts that can lead to mass suffering and starvation, combined with severe weather events, food scarcity, water scarcity and so on. They’re just going to collapse under the weight of these pressures, which opens vast areas of the country to militia rule and terrorist infiltration. We see this in Libya, Mali, parts of Nigeria, and, of course, in Afghanistan. This is the future in a world of climate change.",mainstream,M11cfb,climate.change

• Some think that as a last resort, we may need to temporarily cool the planet by modifying the skies. It wouldn’t solve the problem, but it might buy us time.
• This technology, called solar geoengineering, is so controversial that some experts think it could lead to global war.
• But just in case, a team of researchers at Harvard is planning to conduct one of the first outdoor geoengineering experiments.

It’s 2055. A row of airplanes streak across the sky. They’re barely visible because they’re flying far above the usual traffic of jetliners, transport balloons, and delivery drones.

The mission is to release a cloud of tiny particles into the atmosphere. The cloud creates a barrier that reflects sunlight back into space, keeping it from being absorbed on Earth, where it would further warm the planet.

The planes do this every day, as they have for years.

They’re effective. Because of these planes, there are fewer killer heat waves. Some reports say ice loss at the poles has slowed. There are side effects of altering the atmosphere. Massive droughts have caused famines, and some worry the same technology could be used as a weapon.

That scene, which describes geoengineering, isn’t happening today, contrary to what some conspiracy theorists might tell you. But it soon might. Some scientists think geoengineering could be our last resort to prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change.

As far out as it sounds, we’ve already seen a lesser form of related experiments with cloud seeding — a way to make it rain by dropping silver ions into the atmosphere — by governments in China and the United Arab Emirates. But the much larger-scale modification of the atmosphere is being worked on already.

This year, a team of scientists at Harvard is hoping to launch what will be the first engineering test flight for one of the first outdoor sky-modifying geoengineering experiments. They know the technology is so risky it might never be safe enough to use, and there are major ethical considerations about who gets to decide what part of the planet gets this treatment, because the effects would be global.

Magnus Söderlund is a behavioral scientist at Stockholm School of Economics in Stockholm, Sweden. He describes himself in his profile on ResarchGate as “Professor of Marketing and Head of Center for Consumer Marketing at Stockholm School of Economics. Magnus does research in consumer behavior-related areas, often with experimental methods, and with an interest in how consumers are affected by various marketing activities.” On September 3, 2019, at the Gastro Summit on food of the future in Stockholm, Söderlund conducted a powerpoint presentation titled “Can you Imagine Eating Human Flesh?,” in which he said we must “awaken the idea” of eating human flesh in the future, as a way of combatting the effects of climate change. The “Gastro Summit – about the future of food” is being held at the Stockholm Fair. There, behavioral scientist Magnus Söderlund holds seminars that make most people raise their eyebrows. They are about the possibility of eating human flesh – to save the climate.

Swedish-American writer/reporter Celia Farber reports for The Epoch Times that Söderlund argued that since food sources will be scarce in the future, humans must break down the ancient taboos against desecrating the human corpse and eating human flesh, and be introduced to eating things they have thus far considered disgusting–among them, human flesh. He called the taboos against cannibalism “conservative” and people’s resistance to it as a problem that could be overcome, little by little, beginning with persuading people to eat worms and insects, then to tasting human flesh.

In his talk at the Gastro Summit, Söderlund asked the audience how many would be open to the idea of cannibalism. Not many hands went up; some in the audience groaned. When interviewed after his talk, Söderlund reported brightly that 8% of conference participants said they would be open to trying human flesh. When asked if he himself would try it, he replied: “I feel somewhat hesitant but to not appear overly conservative…I’d have to say….I’d be open to at least tasting it.”

1121,"Climate Explained is a collaboration between The Conversation, Stuff and the New Zealand Science Media Centre to answer your questions about climate change.

If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, please send it to climate.change@stuff.co.nz

As someone who has been working on climate change detection and its causes for over 20 years I was both surprised and not surprised that I was asked to write on this topic by The Conversation. For nearly all climate scientists, the case is proven that humans are the overwhelming cause of the long-term changes in the climate that we are observing. And that this case should be closed.

Despite this, climate denialists continue to receive prominence in some media which can lead people into thinking that man-made climate change is still in question. So it’s worth going back over the science to remind ourselves just how much has already been established.

Successive reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – mandated by the United Nations to assess scientific evidence on climate change – have evaluated the causes of climate change. The most recent special report on global warming of 1.5 degrees confirms that the observed changes in global and regional climate over the last 50 or so years are almost entirely due to human influence on the climate system and not due to natural causes.

First we should perhaps ask what we mean by climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines climate change as:

The causes of climate change can be any combination of:
• None Internal variability in the climate system, when various components of the climate system – like the atmosphere and ocean – vary on their own to cause fluctuations in climatic conditions, such as temperature or rainfall. These internally-driven changes generally happen over decades or longer; shorter variations such as those related to El Niño fall in the bracket of climate variability, not climate change.
• None Natural external causes such as increases or decreases in volcanic activity or solar radiation. For example, every 11 years or so, the Sun’s magnetic field completely flips and this can cause small fluctuations in global temperature, up to about 0.2 degrees. On longer time scales – tens to hundreds of millions of years – geological processes can drive changes in the climate, due to shifting continents and mountain building.
• None Human influence through greenhouse gases (gases that trap heat in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide and methane), other particles released into the air (which absorb or reflect sunlight such as soot and aerosols) and land-use change (which affects how much sunlight is absorbed on land surfaces and also how much carbon dioxide and methane is absorbed and released by vegetation and soils).

What changes have been detected?

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent report showed that, on average, the global surface air temperature has risen by 1°C since the beginning of significant industrialisation (which roughly started in the 1850s). And it is increasing at ever faster rates, currently 0.2°C per decade, because the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have themselves been increasing ever faster.

The oceans are warming as well. In fact, about 90% of the extra heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases is being absorbed by the oceans.

A warmer atmosphere and oceans are causing dramatic changes, including steep decreases in Arctic summer sea ice which is profoundly impacting arctic marine ecosystems, increasing sea level rise which is inundating low lying coastal areas such as Pacific island atolls, and an increasing frequency of many climate extremes such as drought and heavy rain, as well as disasters where climate is an important driver, such as wildfire, flooding and landslides.

Multiple lines of evidence, using different methods, show that human influence is the only plausible explanation for the patterns and magnitude of changes that have been detected.

This human influence is largely due to our activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, as well sunlight absorbing soot. The main sources of these warming gases and particles are fossil fuel burning, cement production, land cover change (especially deforestation) and agriculture.

Most of us will struggle to pick up slow changes in the climate. We feel climate change largely through how it affects weather from day-to-day, season-to-season and year-to-year.

The weather we experience arises from dynamic processes in the atmosphere, and interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans and the land surface. Human influence on the broader climate system acts on these processes so that the weather today is different in many ways from how it would have been.

One way we can more clearly see climate change is by looking at severe weather events. A branch of climate science, called extreme event or weather attribution, looks at memorable weather events and estimates the extent of human influence on the severity of these events. It uses weather models run with and without measured greenhouse gases to estimate how individual weather events would have been different in a world without climate change.

As of early 2019, nearly 70% of weather events that have been assessed in this way were shown to have had their likelihood and/or magnitude increased by human influence on climate. In a world without global warming, these events would have been less severe. Some 10% of the studies showed a reduction in likelihood, while for the remaining 20% global warming has not had a discernible effect. For example, one study showed that human influence on climate had increased the likelihood of the 2015-2018 drought that afflicted Cape Town in South Africa by a factor of three.

Weather extremes underlie many of the hazards that damage society and the natural environment we depend upon. As global warming has progressed, so have the frequency and intensity of these hazards, and the damage they cause.

Minimising the impacts of these hazards, and having mechanisms in place to recover quickly from the impacts, is the aim of climate adaptation, as recently reported by the Global Commission on Adaptation.

As the Commission explains, investing in adaptation makes sense from economic, social and ethical perspectives. And as we know that climate change is caused by humans, society cannot use “lack of evidence” on its cause as an excuse for inaction any more.

196,"Discussions of a Green New Deal (GND) have been all the rage these days, as hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets around the world to demand action on climate change.

First proposed in 2008 to initiate a comprehensive action plan to combat climate change in the UK, the Green New Deal (GND) has come to global attention, gaining particular traction in North America.

Its vision goes beyond the ""green,"" ""hip,"" ""vegan,"" and ""mindful"" lifestyle choices of a burgeoning elite social class or the tried and failed policies of carbon-offsetting, cap and trade, and sustainable development of green capitalism.

 

 It proposes definitive steps to help combat impending climate crises and to give the younger generation hope in the face of rapidly accelerating socio-ecological breakdown and unprecedented inequality.

It puts forward a plan to shift the economy away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy; to eliminate polluting practices in industrial production; to provide affordable housing for all, free education and health care; to create jobs with dignified working conditions and security, and to promote racial, gender and socio-economic equity and justice.

But for the GND to work and, indeed, transform the economy and our lives, it must be decolonial. This means, its application must go hand in hand with a concerted effort to rethink relationships to land, labour, and our collective imaginaries from the structural and historic injustices of Western-style development.

The understanding that development policies and ideas rooted in European and North American notions of ""progress"" are destructive and exploitative by their nature must be at the heart of the GND. In seeking to build a new economy and another way of relating to the environment around us, we must heed the advice of indigenous people, in their historical and ongoing demands for cultural autonomy and self-determination, on the need to restore a diversity of relationships with our environment.

What does it mean to be 'green'?

The GND is meant to halt the loss of biodiversity, the degradation of soils, water, and rapidly decelerate global warming to pre-empt further the catastrophic impacts of climate change that a failure to stay below two degrees of warming will bring.

To achieve all these things, however, technological fixes, such as carbon capture and storage, bound to market economy forces cannot be the solution. The relationships we must develop with our living environment cannot depend on policies regulated by costly, unpredictable and market-driven accounting metrics, which defy the speed and severity of the social and climate shifts we are experiencing.

While all efforts to put the ""emergency brake"" on ecological degradation are needed, we must recognise the roots of how today's custodianship and caretaking of land and waters was established and how it is linked to Western notions of development.

Our development trajectory has been marred by the idea that humans are the overlords of the world, who have to tame nature and submit it to exploitation for their exclusive benefit. It implies that human civilisation is somehow separate from nature, whose only role is to provide unlimited resources to feed and expand the human material world.

The separation between humanity and nature is also implied in how environmentalism has been approached in Western societies. It implies that environmental degradation is merely a symptom of bad management in an otherwise non-negotiable economic development model. The arrogance of this logic is deeply embedded in the mechanisms adopted by the international community to respond to social and ecological crises, including its sustainability policies.

As long as we erroneously see ourselves as outside and above the rest of the living world, we will continue to contribute to its destruction. A decolonial GND, therefore, requires repositioning ourselves vis-à-vis nature as an integral part of it - just as many indigenous peoples have consistently sought to do in their historical and ongoing struggle for cultural autonomy and self-determination.

GND policies must not simply aim to rectify harmful human activity that destroys biodiversity, soil fertility, and greenhouse gas pollution but engender a completely different approach to producing food, building human settlements and meeting human needs.

Under a decolonial GND, agricultural practices, for example, will have to be completely overhauled. Mass production and distribution will have to be phased out, as should the current practices of optimising yields through monoculture farming. Instead, transitions are required that focus on regenerative agricultural practices to return nutrients to soils; encourage and recognise knowledge passed down between generations farming the land; ensure healthy non-GMO food production that is affordable to all; and rebuild relationships between producers and consumers.

What is so 'new' about it?

The GND must also adopt a completely different approach to the human economy. First, it must recognise that the crises produced by capitalism cannot be solved by capitalism itself. Capitalism, much like the burning of fossil fuels which feeds it, should rather be phased out and replaced with a diversity of decentralised solidarity economies that put social justice and both individual and collective welfare at the core of their mission.

A GND can therefore only be ""new"" if it is premised upon a commitment to limiting and redistributing wealth, is oriented towards understanding well-being as sufficiency rather than ceaseless desires and ensures that the means of production are re-localised to transfer decision-making power to communities at the frontlines of resource extraction.

Second, any GND for the Global North must embrace degrowth, which means scaling down overall material consumption and energy use rather than simply making them more efficient, which would still expand growth and enable further extraction. It also means moving society away from wealth accumulation and expansion as a goal in itself and towards wealth distribution and social justice.

In this sense, changing one's lifestyle choices - buying ""green"" and eating vegan or organic food - is not a solution to environmental and social justice problems. Rather people require support systems to radically alter the way they live and consume. These support systems might involve fostering conditions of solidarity, connection, and joy that are otherwise sapped from the individuality of materialism masquerading as ""happiness"". Doing so means that learning to live with what is enough to provide for basic needs and good health should not be seen as a sacrifice, but as something to gain.

This is the first step to building a society for everyone, radically different than the one we have now that favours the pursuit of self-enrichment and indulgence.

Third, the GND must also create the conditions for poorer countries to develop according to their own democratically chosen development path. For that to happen, degrowth policies have to be coupled with decolonisation of the global economy. Although the age of colonialism is supposedly over, colonial dynamics still very much dominate relations between the ""developed"" and the ""developing"" and determine hegemonic patterns of production and consumption.

If the GND does not address the uneven patterns of where production and consumption take place then it threatens to derail ""green"" or energy-efficient transformations in the global South. For example, if the shift to renewable energy is carried out without a parallel decolonisation of trade relations, then countries like Bolivia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, rich in coltan, lithium, antimony, nickel and other materials used in green technologies, would still face the dangers of extractivism.

Even if measures are taken to ensure that renewable energy production does not contaminate and deplete water, destroy habitats, and displace communities - hardly likely in any economic model predicated on optimising outcomes while minimising costs - unequal economic relations would doom these countries to a new form of domination known as ""green colonialism"".

A decolonial GND must therefore prioritise restructuring global trade relations and reversing the enormous imbalances of cultural, economic and political power between Western governments and the global South.

When the prefixes of ""green"" and ""new"" are removed, we are left with ""deal"". This requires understanding what the current ""deal"" is and why it must be fundamentally restructured.

Apart from embracing workers' rights and progressive social policies, a decolonial GND must also actively interrogate the racial, gender and class supremacies which have ruled the world and extracted wealth for the benefit of a privileged minority for centuries.

This is because, the ongoing and increasingly dire ecological collapse is very much the result of a perverse ""social contract"" in which patriarchy, capitalism and white supremacy shape human behaviour.

We live in a world where black, brown, feminine, queer and working-class bodies have faced unthinkable acts of violent dehumanisation under the banner of contemporary Western development.

This way of making and shaping the world and its inhabitants has not gone away with the introduction of symbolic laws forbidding discrimination. It remains fundamental to the socio-economic relations which dominate our lives and which tie ecological destruction and racialised cheap labour to the maintenance of uneven relations of trade across the world.

Take historical plantations as an example. The production of commodities like sugar and cotton involved both the brutal enslavement of people and the ruthless abuse of the environment, which led to severe deforestation, soil erosion and habitat destruction. The goods extracted through violent exploitation of both humans and nature were then sold for the benefit of wealthy white settler colonialists.

This plantation model has not fundamentally changed since slavery was officially abolished. It has rather become more sophisticated with the liberalisation of the economy and the advent of digital technology which today ensures greater predictability and control in yields, labour hours and profits.

Today, agriculture and other sectors around the world are still dependent on a largely racialised and marginalised labour force, coerced in myriad ways to accept harsh working conditions. And again the outcomes are the same: destruction of the environment and ever-burgeoning profit for a select few.

A decolonial GND must break the bonds of the plantation model of social relations by introducing a new ""social contract"" rooted in ethical and political commitment to social, racial and gender justice. It must seek to establish a completely new set of rules for socio-economic relations in our society - one based on acceptance, respect for human life and dignity, solidarity, and equity.

Under a decolonial GND, temporary, underpaid employment will be discontinued. Job creation will be generated by the economic transformation away from fossil fuels and overexploitation of resources and towards worker-owned renewable energy and the relocalisation of industry that puts collective interests over individual ones.

Jobs will have to pay enough for the employee to sustain a dignified life; they will have to provide social security and desirable working conditions that are free of abuse and discrimination and stimulate creativity.

Worker-owned cooperatives could be one model to follow to create jobs and provide various community services, from health care and child care to recycling and security. However, this will only work if cooperatives are themselves embedded in globally decolonised economies geared towards responsible relations between people and the land.

A decolonial GND must also recognise and seek to compensate for the ills that centuries of racial, gender and social oppression have produced. It must, therefore, pay special attention to historically marginalised groups and indigenous communities dispossessed of their lands and ways of knowing and being. As part of this transformation, it should also make provisions for reparations for colonial injustices.

Thus, I suggest three organising principles for a decolonial GND: 1) ""Going green"" must rethink and experiment in alternative human relationships to each other and to non-humans, rooted in reciprocity and responsibility. 2) The world economy must be reoriented towards principles of degrowth, decolonisation and relocalisation 3) The unequal power relations underlying the ""social contract"" of Western development models must be democratised to eliminate discrimination and racial supremacy in all its forms.

For a GND to work however, it cannot be limited to discussions and action within the borders of a single country or region. The dehumanising and ecologically destructive forces of capitalism have proven to adhere to no borders, so any response strategies under a GND must have a global scope.

A GND requires collective commitment to resist oppressive forces that are literally waging a war against a good life for all. This means political resistance and action in the streets, each in their own way responding to the induced austerity policies of state and market that together reinforce the ""social contract"" responsible for ecological collapse.

At the same time, ""decolonial"" cannot be another prefix to tack on along with ""green"" and ""new"" to make a status-quo development ""deal"" appear more inclusive. It must recognise both the global power of Western development models in organising people and nature in violent ways, but also more regional and historically-specific variants. These may include the subjugation of people and their relationships to the land in places like Kashmir or West Papua and the rising demonisation of indigenous worldviews in Brazil and Bolivia.

A decolonial GND requires constant learning, building mutual consent and trust, and self-reflection of the embedded thought processes and habitus patterns that we all hold in contributing to such oppression, whether we realise it or not.

We have reached a point of no return and we must realise that there is no saviour and no quick-fix solution for the climate catastrophe we currently face. While the ""mess"" we are in was not created by all of humanity equally (and we must recognise this!), it is a ""mess"" of such proportions that we need committed and unconditional solidarity to get ourselves out of it.

NEW YORK (AP) — As global temperatures creep higher and the risk of deadly wildfires grows, utilities in the West are struggling to respond to the threat. San Diego Gas & Electric was ahead of the curve when it began strengthening its wildfire prediction and electricity distribution systems a decade ago. At the time, some of its decisions were unpopular. But now, while its northern neighbor Pacific Gas & Electric confronts a so-called climate change bankruptcy after its equipment sparked the deadliest wildfire in state history, the Southern California company is viewed as a model for how utilities as far-flung as Australia can prepare for the worst impacts of climate change.

SDG&E invested $1.5 billion over a decade swapping wood poles for steel, hiring meteorologists, deploying helicopters with infrared inspection capabilities and building a sophisticated weather monitoring system with mountaintop cameras and about 200 stations which capture 200,000 weather-related data points daily.

Caroline Winn, chief operating officer, was at SDG&E when its equipment sparked a deadly wildfire in 2007, and she was one of thousands to evacuate her home. She reflected on how the company’s culture changed after the disaster and how executives’ attitudes about the role energy companies play in climate change has shifted dramatically. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

Q: What prompted San Diego Gas & Electric to invest so heavily in overhauling its operations to reduce the risk of wildfires?

A: Our journey began over a decade ago when the San Diego region really experienced the unprecedented levels of destruction from firestorms in October of 2007. Those fires were among the most destructive in California history at that time. Unfortunately, there were lives lost and there were hundreds of structures, including those that belong to our employees, that were damaged or lost, and around 500,000 acres were scorched.

On that day, we knew that the National Weather Service had called for a red flag event, but that’s about all we knew. So when the fires broke out, we were really in a reactive mode. It affected so many of us in this company on such a personal level that ... keeping our infrastructure from causing any fires became this rallying call across the company.

We really shifted from being focused on keeping the lights on — because that was really our main focus — to the most important attribute becoming keeping our communities safe.

There wasn’t a prescriptive plan that existed in terms of how we should design, engineer, construct or maintain our infrastructure against the increasing threat of violent fires. There wasn’t a blueprint on how to develop and build out what would become one of our largest utility-owned weather networks.

Back in 2007 the belief in climate change wasn’t what it is today. But one thing was really clear to us: we experienced climate conditions that we had never experienced in previous decades.

Q: Your company began proactively shutting off the power to reduce wildfire risks in 2013. How did customers react initially and how was that changed?

A: It was really met with fierce opposition from the public. We were the first utility to do this and people didn’t understand why we had to turn off the power for public safety.

Despite the harsh criticism, we stayed the course. We held town halls after the shutoff so that the community could understand the type of conditions we were experiencing. But also it was important for us to listen to what our customers needed during these types of experiences.

Acceptance of the power shut-offs is significantly better than it was in 2013. We get very few complaints because I think they understand why we do it, and how we do it, in that our goal is really to keep our communities safe.

Q: How does SDG&E help people with limited financial resources tolerate blackouts?

A: We have partnered with the food banks and Meals on Wheels so they’re able to provide necessities to the more vulnerable customers, whether they’re income-qualifying customers or they have mobility issues or they’re seniors. We really, since 2007, grew deep relationships with these organizations because that is our way to help every customer through these situations.

Q: What are the most important things utilities must do to prepare for climate change?

A: I think about it in terms of our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We’ve installed over 3,000 electric vehicle charging stations in areas that don’t have as much access to electric vehicle charging ... and 45% of our electricity that we provide to customers comes from the sun and the wind.

Climate change is impacting the wildfire threat, but also the CO2 (carbon dioxide) and emissions of wildfires are tremendous. So if we can get a chance of ensuring that these wildfires, if they happen, stay small and that utility infrastructure is not the cause of it, then we really feel that we are leaning in...and we’re adapting very aggressively and progressively.",mainstream,M0c15e,climate.change
1042,"Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to address Congress on the deal the Obama Administration is trying to do with Iran to curtail its nuclear program. No doubt, Netanyahu will warn a deal that will eventually allow Iran to get nuclear weapons will cause big problems for the world. There has been increasing friction and drama with President Obama over this address. All the drama surrounding Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress can only mean one thing—negotiations with the U.S. and Iran to curtail its program are not going well. Likely, there will be, once again, no deal at the end of the current deadline, which is the end of next month. Some Democrats are threatening to boycott the address, and members of the President’s staff have clearly said they are not happy with Congress for inviting the Israeli Prime Minister. I predict this will be resolved one way or another this year.

Another top NATO general is, once again, warning about increased possibilities of war with Russia. The most recent ceasefire was broken not long after it was instituted, and now there is no end to the fighting in sight.

In the Middle East, it looks like plans are being made to try to attack the Islamic State, or ISIS, in Iraq. Some 25,000 regional troops are being prepared to try to take back Mosul, which is the second biggest city in Iraq. The U.S. is not supplying troops for the assault, only military trainers. The U.S. will supply air power, but a few weeks ago, American military experts said it would take around 80,000 top quality troops to defeat ISIS. The operation is planned for the spring of this year.

The Federal Reserve is adamantly against any sort of audit. Fed Chief Janet Yellen thinks the Central bank needs its independence, which some call total secrecy and non-transparent monetary policy. When asked to provide information about a recent meeting with the White House and the Treasury, Yellen said they were “private one-on-one meetings” and releasing any information as to what was talked about would, according to Yellen, not be “appropriate.” The Federal Reserve is not federal and is, in fact, a cartel of private banks.

Finally, there is record snowfall and record cold temperatures this winter. I think this makes it a tough sell for the man-made global warming proponents. The facts say the climate is getting colder, and not warmer. I think the reason the name was changed to “climate change” is because most people not only realize this fact, but are experiencing it in everyday life this winter.

128,"The Arctic has warmed more than the rest of the planet, and its ice cover has thinned and shrunk. Last September, at the end of the summer melt season, the ice extent was about 825,000 square miles smaller than the long-term average—a loss equal to the size of Alaska and California combined. That loss speeds the warming, as sunlight is absorbed by dark ocean instead of reflected into space by ice.

Melting sea ice doesn’t raise sea level—it’s already in the water—but melting land ice does. Mountain glaciers are in global retreat. The total sea level rise of eight or nine inches since 1900 has contributed to a sharp increase in flooding along coasts.

553,"The relationship between human activities and climate change, involving both causes as well as impacts, has become a major issue of concern and interest all over the world. The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change informs us that the atmospheric concentration of CO has increased from 280 ppm in the period 1000–1750 AD to 379 ppm in the year 2005. The terrestrial biospheric exchange had been a cumulative source of about 30 Gt C for the past two centuries but acted as a sink in the 1990s. The concentration of methane in the atmosphere has more than doubled from 700 ppb in the period 1000–1750 AD, to reach a concentration of 1774 ppb in the year 2005. The concentrations of hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, SF and N O have also increased. The tropospheric concentration of ozone has increased even though its stratospheric concentration has decreased. The rising emissions and concentrations of all these gases have led to numerous changes in global climate variables. The global mean surface temperature is very likely to have increased by 0.74±0.18°C during the hundred year period 1906–2005. Although the increase is spread out all over the globe, it is greater in the northern hemisphere, and land areas have warmed faster than the oceans. It is very likely that the number of hot days and hot nights has increased and the number of cold days, cold nights and frost has decreased for nearly all land areas.

Here are factors that could help and hurt the climate, in both the short and longer terms:

Improvements in air quality: Hubei province, China has been the big winner. Marshall Burke, a researcher at Stanford University, calculated that the improvements in air quality recorded in China may have saved the lives of 4,000 children under 5 years old and 73,000 adults over 70. . Better air is saving more people than coronavirus is killing, in other words. Traffic is down in some of Europe’s dirtiest cities, which have chronically failed to respect EU air quality limits.

Industry shut-downs reduce emissions: A study by specialist outlet Carbon Brief found that in China, carbon dioxide emissions have fallen by around 25 percent, and declining oil demand should push emissions down globally. Airlines are also cutting flights. Beware: If passengers are flying on half-empty planes, fewer flyers does not equal fewer emissions.

Minds may open for structural change: The focus is on health and supply chains right now. But the process of challenging assumptions and fundamentally altering behavior — illustrated by remote work — can be seized on by climate action advocates once the worst of this health crisis is over.

Public financial institutions will push green stimulus: Green investment is a pet interest of Kristalina Georgieva (International Monetary Fund head) and Christine Lagarde (European Central Bank president), while the European Investment Bank is already getting out of coal. Look for regional and global bodies to push green investment incentives.

Low oil prices make it harder for the dirtiest oil to compete, and easier to cut subsidies: Oil prices are at four-year lows thanks to the collapse of the OPEC+ oil cartel, as Russia seeks to drive American oil shale producers out of the market (it may prove too expensive for shale companies to extract their oil in a low-price environment). Meanwhile, governments reluctant to cut for car fuel and heating oil, can now do so with less political pain.

FOUR WAYS CORONA WILL HURT THE ENVIRONMENT:

Political and financial capital will be diverted: Governments will be forced to prioritize public health and struggling banks may change lending criteria, and use the crisis to revise their green targets.

Mountains of waste: Coffee chain Starbucks to stop accepting reusable cups from its customers — now it’s only serving drinks in disposable single-use cups that are recyclable. China is drowning under medical waste (often single-use items by necessity) produced by hospitals. In the city of Wuhan, it’s to more than 200 tons a day.

Home energy use will go up: With oil prices down, more people working from home and public transport a place where coronavirus spreads, consumer energy use will go up. Take demand for home entertainment: Germany’s Deutsche Commercial Internet Exchange interconnection platform, or , reported a record throughput of data this week.

Low profits reduce what a company can invest in risky and long-term bets. Regulation could force a shift to clean energy, but that’s unlikely in the United States and China in a year when the industry is suffering financial losses.

EUROPE AND CANADA STICK TO THE GREEN SCRIPT … MOSTLY: Canadian Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told reporters Tuesday that he expects climate change to remain a central focus of the 2020 Canadian budget, despite the need for emergency coronavirus measures. ""Canadians also told us that climate is a huge priority and that will be reflected when we see the budget,"" he said.

Catch a glimpse of Katy Ayers paddling her canoe on a Nebraska lake this summer and you might do a double take.

At first glance, her 8-foot vessel looks much like any other canoe — same oblong shape, same pointed ends, same ability to float on water.

But upon closer inspection, it’s clearly anything but ordinary: Ayers’ canoe is made out of mushrooms.

More specifically, her boat is made from mycelium, the dense, fibrous roots of the mushroom that typically live beneath the soil. Ayers, 28, a student at Central Community College in Columbus, Nebraska, even gave her creation a fitting name: “Myconoe.”

Though Ayers has taken the canoe out for several quasi-recreational excursions — and plans to do so again as soon as the weather warms up in the rural part of Nebraska where she lives — her real goal with the eye-catching project is to raise broader awareness about mushrooms. She is part of a growing movement of mushroom advocates, people who believe these squishy, sometimes edible fungi can help solve some of our most pressing environmental problems.

In addition to their ability to break down harmful pollutants and chemicals, Ayers pointed out that mushrooms can be used for everything from household insulation to furniture to packaging, replacing plastics, Styrofoam and other materials that are hard to recycle and harmful to the environment.

“Mushrooms are here to help us — they’re a gift,” Ayers said. “There’s so much we can do with them beyond just food; it’s so limitless. They’re our biggest ally for helping the environment.”

Mushrooms aren't exactly mainstream, though citizen scientists like Ayers and some private companies hope to someday change that. The New York-based biotech company Ecovative Design, for instance, has made headlines for its mushroom-based packaging material, which has been deployed by companies such as Ikea and Dell. Mushrooms are being used at the local level to help clean up toxic debris and contaminated soil — a process known as mycoremediation — but so far have not been adopted on a larger scale.

Ayers never paid much attention to mushrooms until she enrolled in 2018 at the college in Columbus, a small city with around 23,000 residents. During her first semester, an English instructor challenged students to find and study a potential solution to climate change.

During her research, Ayers came across a 2013 documentary called “Super Fungi,” which made the case for mushrooms as an environmental ally and highlighted some of their innovative uses.

Ayers was sold on the power of mushrooms instantly. Having learned that mycelium is buoyant and waterproof, she decided to try using it to create a boat.

“I always have very big ideas,” she said. “So I see something and it’s small and I just want to make it bigger and better. Since I’m from Nebraska, I love to fish. I’ve always wanted a boat. Why not just grow it?”

With a mini-grant from the college, Ayers got to work. She reached out to a mushroom company in nearby Grand Island for help, sharing her idea with owner Ash Gordon. He agreed to help immediately and offered her a summer internship so she could learn the ins and outs of fungi.

During the day, Ayers worked alongside Gordon at Nebraska Mushroom, doing lab work, creating spawn and harvesting, packaging and processing mushrooms.

After finishing their work for the day, the two turned their attention to the canoe project. They first built a wooden skeleton and a hammock-like structure to suspend the boat-shaped form in the air.

They next sandwiched the boat’s skeleton with mushroom spawn and let nature take over.

For two weeks, the fledgling canoe hung inside a special growing room in Gordon’s facility, where temperatures ranged between 80 and 90 degrees and the humidity hovered between 90 to 100 percent. The last step in the process was to let the 100-pound boat dry in the Nebraska sun.

All told, Ayers said she spent $500 on spawn, tools and equipment to build the canoe.

Ayers, who displayed her “Myconoe” at the 2019 Nebraska State Fair, has taken the canoe out for three test floats, including one in which two people comfortably sat inside. The boat is still alive, which means it fruits — grows mushrooms — each time they take it out for a paddle.

The successful mycelium canoe inspired Ayers and Gordon to experiment with making chairs, landscaping bricks and other items.

Though it started as a hands-on learning opportunity for Ayers in the course of her collegiate studies, the canoe has also served as a quirky conduit for conversations about mushrooms.

“It’s not just a piece of art, this is a functioning boat that works,” Gordon, 39, said. “It really helps bridge that gap between people who didn’t have an interest in mushrooms — maybe they don’t like to eat mushrooms and really haven’t thought about other potential uses for them. The boat gave them something to look at and think about.”

Now Ayers is sharing her newfound fungi fabrication knowledge with other students at the community college. She’s part of Growing Pathways to STEM, a full-ride scholarship program funded by the National Science Foundation that aims to help low-income and underserved undergraduates studying science, technology, engineering and math.

Ayers is leading one of the cohort’s main research projects: building bee hotels, small structures also called nests or homes, from mycelium.

Inspired by research from Washington State University, which found that honeybees who consumed mycelium extract had lower levels of a harmful virus, Ayers and her classmates hope to better understand the effects of mycelium on Nebraska’s solitary bees.

Though the community college closed all campus buildings in early April to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Ayers is keeping the project alive in her basement while taking online classes.

In addition to her full-time course load, Ayers works as the community college’s sustainability intern, keeping tabs on energy use across the community college system’s seven campuses and centers.

The internship, which Ayers has also been able to continue remotely, and self-led mushroom research projects are just the start: After graduating with an associate’s degree in science, Ayers plans to earn a bachelor’s degree in biology and, later, a doctorate in mycology.

And after that? Save the planet.

78,"Takeda predicts that climate change will help its Zika and dengue fever vaccines find a larger market. Roche says it could ultimately make it attractive for the company to develop treatments for diseases like malaria. And AbbVie says extreme weather events might boost its immunology products.

But the potential risks of climate change — and the attendant increase in natural disasters — stand to outstrip any of those incremental gains, as the companies described in recent risk assessment reports to the British nonprofit CDP.

Hurricanes and superstorms, power outages and flooding all threaten manufacturing facilities and research sites, particularly when animals are involved. Droughts, too, threaten critical water supplies. Forest fires, even if remote from a given plant or research facility, bring smoke and air pollution that can similarly disrupt the day-to-day work for drug makers and their supply chain.

Geography doesn’t help, either. The biotech and pharmaceutical industries — concentrated, as they are, in coastal areas like Boston, New Jersey, and California — may face higher risks for extreme weather events.

STAT surveyed the risk assessment plans for more than a dozen major pharmaceutical companies and spoke with officials at labs that survived extreme weather events and others who are planning to avoid their repercussions. All emphasized that the risks are already real — and underscored how hard the industry is working to prepare to meet the challenge.

“You really start to need to ask yourself and sort of reverse-engineer — what are you at risk to, what can you tolerate as a community, as an asset or a structure,” said William Sweet, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, speaking specifically about the impact of even a small rise in sea level in places prone to flooding. “Vulnerabilities that are exposed by today’s events, it’s important to document because those likely are going to be the same area that get exposed and are vulnerable.”

In the last five years alone, extreme weather has caused massive disruptions in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Hurricanes and flooding can wipe out research and manufacturing facilities, smoke and air pollution from forest fires threaten experiments and lab animals — as do frigid temperatures and power outages. And the gradual rise in average temperatures have some concerned that plants and animals that serve as sources of existing and potential new drugs may vanish.

Pfizer, for example, estimates it lost $195 million in inventory and overhead when three Puerto Rico manufacturing facilities were wiped out by the recent devastating hurricane season. Eli Lilly ran its Puerto Rico facility with emergency diesel generators “for months” after the storm.

For some, Hurricane Maria was a wake-up call. To AstraZeneca, the storm “showed the site was not resilient enough.” The company is planning to invest more in weatherproof buildings “for current and future conditions.” AbbVie spent a few thousand dollars securing the roofs on its manufacturing plants on the island.

Wildfires, too, can have an extreme impact — even if they occur further afield. For more than a week in November, wildfires in California sent enough small particles into the air that it became “unhealthy” for residents to breathe without filters — and could have damaged the air filters that research labs do use.

“The R&D that fuels innovative activity in life sciences companies requires conditions that are tightly controlled, particularly when it comes to air quality, temperature, and other climate settings,” said Will Zasadny, the California Life Sciences Association’s communications director. In addition to issues around the power grid and the impact the fires had on employees, he said, “wildfire smoke is damaging on air filtration systems.”

Recent experiences at two research facilities — one in New York and one in Texas — also help illustrate the potential pitfalls for earlier-stage life science research — as well as the promise for facilities that prepare for extreme weather in advance.

When Hurricane Sandy hit New York City in 2012, some of the facilities at NYU Langone, an academic medical center with a hospital and research facilities, flooded and lost power — including two of its animal care facilities. As some scientists carried out temperature-sensitive samples in bins filled with dry ice, others delivered water to the center’s aquariums and evacuated the mice and rats that they could.

Not all of the research animals made it out. According to a National Academies of Science report on disaster resilience, 35,000 mice — which represented about $25 million and about one-third of the system’s total mouse population — died.

“In a way, the public are the ones who lost,” said Jennifer Pullium, the director of NYU Langone’s division of laboratory animal resources. “The purpose of these animals is for biomedical research — to improve the quality of life and health of people. When progress is set back, progress for people is set back.”

Like many places affected by a disaster, NYU Langone planned to rebuild itself without the same soft spots. That meant installing new flood barricades and moving critical things like generators and computers up to higher floors — but also making non-flood related modifications, like making sure the system’s hospitals had air conditioners hooked up to the emergency power network.

“Something like [Sandy] really does help crystallize and motivate a lot of action and a lot of thinking that wouldn’t happen otherwise,” said Paul Schwabacher, NYU Langone’s senior vice president of facilities management. “It did allow us to make a lot of changes and improve things beyond what we’d been planning at the time.”

Langone’s new defenses haven’t been tested yet. But Baylor College of Medicine’s response to 2017’s Hurricane Harvey shows that good preparation should pay off.

The college lost thousands of research animals in Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 — and spent $35 million afterward on better flood defenses, including food gates and pumps.

When Hurricane Harvey hit in 2017 — a Category 4 hurricane that was one of the costliest Atlantic storms ever — the college was ready. Baylor had a “ride out” team of 52 people, including some dedicated to taking care of the medical school’s 100,000 animals while the campus was flooded. None died.

Most of the major biotech and pharmaceutical companies have been preparing for climate change for years.

Johnson & Johnson and Novo Nordisk scored an A rating from CDP; Sanofi, Pfizer, Roche, Novartis, Merck, Eli Lilly, Takeda, and Biogen all scored an A minus. GlaxoSmithKline and AbbVie earned B ratings, and Amgen and Bristol-Myers Squibb got C’s. The ratings are based on the company’s awareness and management of climate change issues.

The size and type of their investments in those preparations vary.

Johnson & Johnson, for example, wrote in its report that it underwent a full-blown review of its water scarcity activities after a drought affected its facilities in Cape Town, South Africa. Biogen poured $500,000 into new software to monitor its supply chain after hurricanes and storms affected two of its major locations. Amgen highlighted its efforts to reduce water use, spotlighting a facility that now reuses about 74 percent of the treated wastewater it generates to cool its manufacturing equipment.

In Cambridge, Mass.’s legendary Kendall Square, one local real estate developer has already worked to ensure that a third of the facilities it manages there are prepared for extreme weather events all the way up through 2050 or further.

Those preparations are necessary in part because of where Kendall Square sits. A short walk from the Charles River, the biotech hub already faces a small flood risk from major storms. According to a recent city report, new issues may start to crop up soon. By 2050, the water around Boston should be a foot or two higher than it was in 2000 — so high that the city’s report on climate change vulnerability says the dams that separate the rivers around the city from Massachusetts Bay would be pretty useless.

If a once-in-a-decade storm hits, winds might blow the water up from the pond or river — a storm surge — or water might come back up from drainage pipes.

Alexandria Real Estate has over 4.3 million square feet of office space in Kendall Square. That includes at least 1.9 million square feet of brand-new space built with climate change in mind.

Gone are basement electrical rooms and data centers — they’ve been moved up to the first floor. Thresholds for first-floor doors, too, are all above the point the city’s reports suggest water might ultimately rise if a major storm hits after the sea levels around the city have risen by a foot or two. Yet the real estate company’s not-inconsiderable power mostly stops at the thresholds of their own buildings. The company can’t stop a street from flooding or make sure the city’s drains won’t become overwhelmed with stormwater. Developers in Kendall have tried; among other things, Alexandria and others have paid for a new stormwater drain that can take up to 630,000 gallons of stormwater.

One thing that Alexandria and others can do — and have done — is ensure that their buildings won’t make flooding worse. Some Alexandria-owned buildings have equipment on the roofs that can store stormwater for a while before its released — slowly — to the street; each site also has a system in place to encourage rain to drain into the ground first, not into the streets. And specialized valves prevent sewer backups from bringing that water into a building. (Even the toilets will still work without adding to the sewer’s problems, at least for a day.)

“We’re confident that our tenants and our properties here in Kendall Square are well-protected from climate change vulnerabilities like flooding,” Andrews said.

There are less tangible risks to consider, too: the prospect that if a company’s approach to climate change is too timid, it could be harder to recruit talented employees in an industry where sterling job applicants often have the upper hand.

“As a science-based company focused on improving the quality of life, stakeholders may set expectations related to Biogen’s efforts towards climate change,” the company stated — adding that if they fail to meet those expectations, potential employees may go elsewhere. “Loss of highly-qualified employees to competitors due to falling short of expectations could place Biogen’s research and development efforts at risk.”

Merck’s report puts a more positive spin on the issue. “We recognize that our policies and actions around social and environmental issues such as our carbon footprint can help attract and attain talent,” the company wrote.

Yet to some, one industry alone can’t make up for a broader failure to act.

“It would seem that, you know, as a nation, we should be doing much more to try to mitigate these risks. They’re just tremendous, and I don’t think we’ve reflected on the cost of climate change and other risks that are coming,” said NYU’s Schwabacher.

“We could be doing more — should be doing more.”",mainstream,M0c46e,climate.change; global.warming
1186,"Countries must make steeper cuts to their greenhouse gas emissions, making up for lost time, or risk missing their pledges to limit global warming, top United Nations officials said Tuesday.

A report by the U.N. Environment Program, released just ahead of next week’s climate conference in Madrid, revealed that the amount of planet-heating gases being pumped into the atmosphere hit a new high last year, with potentially dire consequences.

The report closely follows the release of another U.N. finding that says planned production of coal, oil and gas is still too much to allow for hitting more aggressive goals that some climate-change watchers have said are necessary.

“We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020,” said UNEP’s head Inger Andersen. “We need to catch up on the years in which we procrastinated.”

Man-made greenhouse gas emissions rose in 2018 to 55.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the U.N.’s annual “emissions gap” report. While much of the increase came from emerging economies such as China and India, some of those emissions are the result of manufacturing in developed countries, including the U.S. and Germany. And Norway, for instance, touts its green credentials while it continues to drill for oil in the North Sea.

Levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached another new record high, separate data from the World Meteorological Organization showed, backing figures offered by UNEP. The WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin showed that globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 407.8 parts per million in 2018, up from 405.5 parts per million (ppm) in 2017.

“This continuing long-term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems,” the WMO said in its release.

To stop average global temperatures from increasing by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century compared with pre-industrial times, worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases will have to drop by 7.6% each year in the coming decade, the U.N. agency said. Scientists say the 1.5C target — contained in the 2015 Paris climate accord — would avert some of the more extreme changes in global weather patterns predicted if temperatures rise further.

“What we are looking at is really that emissions need to go down by 55% by 2030,” said John Christensen, lead author and director of the UNEP-Danish Technology Institute Partnership.

Even the less ambitious goal of capping global warming at 2C (3.6 F) would require annual emissions cuts of 2.7% between 2020 and 2030, UNEP said.

Right now, national pledges would leave the world 3.2 degrees Celsius (5.8 Fahrenheit) warmer by 2100 than pre-industrial times, with dramatic consequences for life on Earth, the U.N. agency said. Getting the world back on track to 1.5C would require a fivefold increase in measures pledged so far, it calculated.

Last week, UNEP published a separate report, which found that countries are planning to extract more than twice the amount of fossil fuels from the ground than can be burned in 2030 if the 1.5C target is to be met.

Read: Bill Gates-backed Heliogen’s solar ‘breakthrough’ could replace fossil fuels in steel and other big-polluting industries

“As individuals, we have a choice about how we live, what we eat and how we go about our business ... and opportunities to live a lower-carbon life,” said Andersen.

Governments’ plans to reduce emissions haven’t been universally welcomed, however, with some critics saying that eliminating or sharply reducing fossil fuels will prove to be an economic shock, in fuel costs for instance, that hurts poorer populations more than wealthier sections.

What’s more, a $60-billion package of measures agreed by the German government recently has been criticized as a further burden on businesses, while environmentalists say it is too little, too late. Presenting a study Tuesday showing average surface air temperatures in the country have already risen by 1.5C since 1881, German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze insisted that Europe’s industrial powerhouse “is one of the countries that is doing a lot.”

“There are other countries which are quitting climate accords,” she added, without explicitly naming the United States, which under President Donald Trump announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, citing noncompliance by China and others.

But economists say the widespread effects could hit all countries and those most vulnerable are at the greatest risk. The global economy will be at least 3% smaller by 2050 owed solely to the effects of unchecked climate change, including severe weather and rising sea levels, some major investment banks have warned.

In the Paris agreement, nearly 200 countries set their own national targets for reducing or controlling pollution of heat-trapping gases. It was negotiated in 2015 with lots of prodding by the U.S. and China at that time and went into effect Nov. 4, 2016. The terms of the deal say no country can withdraw in the first three years; Trump began the U.S. withdrawal process earlier this month.

Experts agree that the longer countries continue burning fossil fuels, the more warming will be “locked in” as emissions stay in the atmosphere for years or even decades. Conversely, the sooner countries take steps to wean themselves off gas, coal and oil — such as by ending government subsidies for fossil fuels — the more warming will be prevented in the long term.",mainstream,M0ee12,climate.change; global.warming
1043,"FRANKFURT — Climate change has already been blamed for deadly bush fires in Australia, withering coral reefs, rising sea levels and ever more cataclysmic storms. Could it also cause the next financial crisis?

A report issued this week by an umbrella organization for the world’s central banks argued that the answer is yes, while warning that central bankers lack tools to deal with what it says could be one of the biggest economic dislocations of all time.

The book-length report, published by the Bank for International Settlements, in Basel, Switzerland, signals what could be the overriding theme for central banks in the decade to come.

“Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to human societies, and our community of central banks and supervisors cannot consider itself immune to the risks ahead of us,” François Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Banque de France, said in the report.",mainstream,M0afd9,climate.change
1220,"ime for something like panic: last week the UN climate talks in Madrid essentially collapsed, even as scientists were reporting that the 2010s had been by far the hottest decade since records began. Most of the blame fell on countries like the U.S., Brazil, and Saudi Arabia, but around the world political systems simply aren’t responding to the greatest crisis they’ve ever faced—they’re so corrupted by fossil fuel money, so overcome by inertia, so preoccupied with the next election or coup.

But, amid the desolation, there were a couple of signs of hope. They came from the world of high finance.

Just as young people and indigenous leaders were being kicked out of the UN talks for their protests, the Liberty Mutual insurance company became one of the first big U.S. insurers to announce it would stop aiding coal companies. The announcement came after sustained pressure from a coalition of environmental groups called Insure Our Future, and though Liberty’s pledges are just a beginning—oil and gas are the bigger future threats at this point, as coal’s decline is already underway—it was proof that even vast sums of money can’t insulate companies from activism.

That point was underscored over when Goldman Sachs announced on December 14 that it would restrict its lending to the coal industry, and further that it wasn’t interested in funding the drilling of the Arctic. Again a coalition of groups—from the Gwich’in tribe in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the Sierra Club and the Rainforest Action Network—had pressed hard. And again Goldman’s response was just a first step. But given the imbalance in forces—a remote native band against one of the world’s biggest banks—it was a hopeful sign.

Hopeful because these kinds of campaigns are going to expand and build. More and more, organizers are deciding that, after decades of asking governments to change, they’re also going to have to go after other power centers. Washington and Wall Street are deeply linked, but they’re also distinct, and both need to shift dramatically.

And hopeful for other reasons too. Even if we can get politicians to make real change, it will come slowly, and one national capitol at a time. But if these financial giants begin to move, the effects will be both quick and global—and those are the two things most required for effective progress on the climate.

This winter will likely see a prolonged campaign against big insurers, big asset managers like Blackrock, and big banks. Chase Bank exemplifies the problem: they’re the worst, lending hundreds of billions of dollars for the most extreme fossil fuel projects on earth. They’ve dramatically their lending since the Paris accords; they’re the bankroll for the most dangerous activity on planet earth. If these bankers plugged the money pipeline, the fossil fuel industry would have to stop expanding—which is precisely what scientists have told us is now required.

It may seem impossible to take banks that size on—they’re literally a central pillar of global capital. But look at them another way: unlike Exxon or Shell, they’re able to make plenty of money from things other than fossil fuel. Destroying the planet is only a side business for them—heck, they could make money financing the transition to sun and wind. And they’re potentially vulnerable to citizen anger. Activists, more and more, are taking up the cry of “Make Them Pay,” understanding that it’s not okay to pile up profits by devastating the planet. Chase has 5,000 branches spread across America. Indigenous activists joined by my colleagues at the 350 Seattle chapter shut down all 44 branches in their city for a day last spring, and there’s no reason not to try the same thing across the country. Anyone with a pair of scissors can cut up a credit card.

Think about that electoral map that Trump always holds up to taunt his foes, the one with the huge patches of red. Well, a map of the country’s shows that most of it is in those blue patches where people care deeply about climate change: if electoral power is unfairly spread, so is financial power, but this time in a way that might work to put pressure on the banks.

The political and the financial are not completely separate tracks for activists, of course. Around the world, campaigners are also going after central banks, the government-sponsored institutions that control much of the planet’s monetary policy. The European Investment Bank announced earlier this autumn that it would no longer finance fossil fuel projects; campaigners in Switzerland said December 16 that they were getting closer to persuading the Swiss Central Bank to take action (and Swiss banks are no small thing!). But the truly big money is piled up in those American institutions that dominate global finance. That dominance is not fair nor wise, but right now it gives us one more lever to reach for in this moment of climate crisis.",mainstream,M08b14,climate.change

NEW YORK (AP) — A changing climate means dramatic risks for the world — and for investments too, the chief of the world’s largest investment manager said Tuesday.

To prepare for and protect against those risks, BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink said in his influential annual letter to CEOs that his firm, which manages roughly $7 trillion for investors, will make a series of moves putting climate change and sustainability at the center of its investing approach.

Among them, BlackRock will cut out investments in some coal producers from some of its portfolios, sharply increase the number of sustainability-focused funds that it offers, and vote against companies at shareholder meetings when they’re too slow in disclosing and mitigating their impact on the environment.

“Climate change has become a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects,” Fink wrote in his letter, adding that he believes “we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance” because of it.

Fink predicted that the changes in how capital is deployed will come “more quickly than we see changes to the climate itself,” and “sooner than most anticipate.”

In fact, the shift is already underway.

Investors poured a net $20.6 billion into sustainable funds across the industry last year, nearly quadruple the record set a year earlier, according to Morningstar. Investors, particularly younger ones, increasingly say they want their money invested with an eye toward sustainability. The total dollars are still small relative to the entire industry — investors plugged a total of $413.9 billion into all taxable bond funds last year, while yanking $41.3 billion out of all U.S. stock funds — but the trend is clear and accelerating.

Fearful of losing out on those dollars — and the fees that they produce — investment companies are rushing to meet the surging demand.

BlackRock and other huge asset managers are generally behind smaller competitors when it comes to sustainability, said Danielle Fugere, president of shareholder-advocacy group As You Sow. BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard and others have been criticized for not doing more about the environment. Besides protests outside its Manhattan headquarters, BlackRock has also heard criticism from members of Congress who believe it could better address climate change.

Because of its size and reach, any shift in focus by BlackRock could alter the industry. It is a major shareholder in thousands of companies through its popular exchange-traded funds that track various indexes, as well as its funds run by stock-picking managers. But Fugere said Tuesday’s announcement is only a first step.

“The words are significant, and the words show leadership,” Fugere said. “But that’s not enough. We have to see on the ground action, and we need to see it quickly. There is no time. Australia is burning up. California is burning up.”

The wildfires in parts of Australia and California and other recent disasters have shown big institutional investors that climate change is just as much a threat to their returns in the near term as over the coming decades.

“The physical risks have become so immediately clear and stark,” said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council for Institutional Investors, whose members include pension funds, endowments and other U.S.-based asset owners investing more than $4 trillion.

“Many institutional investors will welcome these steps by BlackRock,” she said. “More and more public funds are coming around to the view that sound environmental, social and governance practices are not just about making the world better but about fundamentally creating and preserving shareholder value.”

This approach to investing comes after a yearslong evolution for the industry, which began with simple funds that bluntly excluded stocks deemed as harmful, such as gun makers or tobacco stocks.

Now, fund managers say they they look at environmental, social and governance issues broadly as part of their analysis of any investment. It’s known as “ESG” investing, and proponents say it aids investors’ returns, not just their consciences, because it helps them avoid risky stocks and big potential losses. Companies with poor records on environmental issues are more likely to face big fines, for example.

For all the noise made by Fink’s announcement, the reaction in the stock market was muted on Tuesday. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 were down, but not as much as some other corners of the market. Coal stocks were mixed.

In his letter, Fink said companies and investors have a role to play in the transition to a low-carbon world, but governments will ultimately need to lead the way.

Some movement has begun. The European Union on Tuesday unveiled a plan to dedicate a quarter of its budget to tackling climate change and to help shift 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in investment towards making the economy more environmentally friendly over the next 10 years. The Europe Investment Plan will be funded by the EU budget and the private sector. It aims to deliver on European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s Green Deal to make the bloc the world’s first carbon-neutral continent by 2050.

“It will be interesting to see whether BlackRock’s high profile move will have any impact on policy,” Borrus said. “Government can do much more in the long run on climate change than investment flows.”

1066,"“Whatever the situation is now, it’s going to be worse two years from now on the peril side, and it’s going to be better on the promise side through clean-energy jobs,” Inslee said in an interview in Washington, D.C., earlier in the week, after he’d already made his decision to run. “So the dynamic is, wherever we are today, by the time of the November election climate will be a more important issue in the electorate, I believe.”

He’ll call his campaign the “Climate Mission Tour,” and kick it off in Iowa, followed by stops in Nevada and California. Among his early backers: Bill Nye, as in Bill Nye the Science Guy, who’s made fighting climate change a major cause. “He’s a science-based guy,” Nye said of Inslee in an interview on Thursday evening, recalling how he first met him years ago on a kayaking trip when the governor was in Congress. “He can contribute a lot to getting progressives focused.”

Inslee has been preparing to run over the past two months, traveling to New Hampshire and Nevada in January. He’s put together a staff and a launch video produced by a couple whose previous clients include the musicians Ed Sheeran and Macklemore. But Inslee didn’t need to invest in polling or focus groups to see if he’s right about how panicked people are about climate change.

He has a February poll from the Center for American Progress that said the 2020 presidential race is wide open, and that climate change has become, in the survey’s words, “a key motivating issue.” Climate change was the top priority for 46 percent of the Democrats in the poll, behind only health care, at 47 percent. The Green New Deal and moving to 100 percent clean energy by 2050 had huge support, too. Having a clear plan for addressing the climate crisis, the pollsters wrote, “helps voters believe that a presidential candidate is serious and forward thinking.”

Inslee, who has been in politics for 30 years, said polls like that help give him a gut feeling that the voters are with him, and that they want more than just talk. He noted that he’s been focused on reducing carbon-dioxide emissions since his first congressional campaign, in 1992. He went on to win that Republican-leaning district, though he lost the seat two years later in a Republican wave.

“It is the issue; it is the primary issue; it is the foremost issue. This has to be the organizing issue of your administration,” he said of climate change. “It can’t be one agency; it can’t be check the box. It has to be the priority. I think it will be revealed who’s got the chops, who’s got the passion, and who’s willing to take the risk to run on this subject and say it is a priority.”

It’s early in the race, but Inslee starts significantly behind, jumping in as a mostly unknown weeks after other candidates made it official and months after many began seriously sketching out plans to win. He’ll also be behind in fundraising, though he will be the first announced 2020 Democratic candidate with an affiliated super PAC supporting him, despite the energy in the party against the big-money groups that has kept most other candidates from using them.",mainstream,M0e243,climate.change
602,"As I report on climate change, I come across a lot of scary facts, like the possibility that thawing permafrost in Siberia could release gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere or the risk that Greenland could pass a tipping point and begin to melt rapidly. But one of the most frightening studies I've read recently had nothing to do with icebergs or mega-droughts. In a paper that came out Oct. 23 in Science, John Sterman  a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Sloan School of Management  wrote about asking 212 MIT grad students to give a rough idea of how much governments need to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by to eventually stop the increase in the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere. These students had training in science, technology, mathematics and economics at one of the best schools in the world  they are probably a lot smarter than you or me. Yet 84% of Sterman's subjects got the question wrong, greatly underestimating the degree to which greenhouse gas emissions need to fall. When the MIT kids can't figure out climate change, what are the odds that the broader public will?

The shocking study reflects the tremendous gap that exists regarding global warming. On the one hand are the scientists, who with few exceptions think climate change is very serious and needs to be dealt with immediately and ambitiously. On the other side is the public, which increasingly believes that climate change is real and worries about it, but which rarely ranks it as a high priority. A 2007 survey by the U.N. Development Programme found that 54% of Americans advocate taking a ""wait and see"" approach to climate-change action  holding off on the deep and rapid cuts in global warming that would immediately impact their lives. (And it's not just SUV-driving Americans who take this position  similar majorities were found in Russia, China and India.) As a result, we have our current dilemma: a steady drumbeat of scientific evidence of global warming's severity and comparatively little in the way of meaningful political action. ""This gap exists,"" says Sterman. ""The real question is why.""

Hear Bryan Walsh and John Sterman talk about the problems faced by scientists in communicating the risks of climate change. 



That's where Sterman's research comes in. ""There is a profound and fundamental misconception about climate,"" he says. The problem is that most of us don't really understand how carbon accumulates in the atmosphere. Increasing global temperatures are driven by the increase in the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere. Before the industrial age, the concentration was about 280 parts per million (p.p.m.) of carbon in the atmosphere. After a few centuries of burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels, we've raised that concentration to 387 p.p.m., and it continues to rise by about 2 p.p.m. every year. Many scientists believe that we need to at least stabilize carbon concentrations at 450 p.p.m. to ensure that global temperatures don't increase more than about 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level. To do that, we need to reduce global carbon emissions (which hit about 10 billion tons last year) until they are equal to or less than the amount of carbon sequestered by the oceans and plant life (which removed about 4.8 billion tons of carbon last year). It's just like water in a bathtub  unless more water is draining out than flowing in from the tap, eventually the bathtub will overflow.

That means that carbon emissions would need to be cut drastically from current levels. Yet almost all of the subjects in Sterman's study failed to realize that, assuming instead that you could stabilize carbon concentration simply by capping carbon emissions at their current level. That's not the case  and in fact, pursuing such a plan for the future would virtually guarantee that global warming could spin out of control. It may seem to many like good common sense to wait until we see proof of the serious damage global warming is doing before we take action. But it's not  we can't ""wait and see"" on global warming because the climate has a momentum all its own, and if we wait for decades to finally act to reduce carbon emissions, it could well be too late. Yet this simply isn't understood. Someone as smart as Bill Gates doesn't seem to get it. ""Fortunately climate change, although it's a huge challenge, it's a challenge that happens over a long period of time,"" he said at a forum in Beijing last year. ""You know, we have time to work on it."" But the truth is we don't.

If élite scientists could simply solve climate change on their own, public misunderstanding wouldn't be such a problem. But they can't. Reducing carbon emissions sharply will require all 6.5 billion (and growing) of us on the planet to hugely change the way we use energy and travel. We'll also need to change the way we vote, rewarding politicians willing to make the tough choices on climate. Instead of a new Manhattan Project  the metaphor often used for global warming  Sterman believes that what is needed is closer to a new civil rights movement, a large-scale campaign that dramatically changes the public's beliefs and behaviors. New groups like Al Gore's We Campaign are aiming for just such a social transformation, but ""the reality is that this is even more difficult than civil rights,"" says Sterman. ""Even that took a long time, and we don't have that kind of time with the climate.""

The good news is that you don't need a Ph.D. in climatology to understand what needs to be done. If you can grasp the bathtub analogy, you can understand how to stop global warming. The burden is on scientists to better explain in clear English the dynamics of the climate system, and how to affect it. (Sterman says that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's landmark report last year was ""completely inadequate"" on this score.) As for the rest of us, we should try to remember that sometimes common sense isn't a match for science.",mainstream,M09a92,climate.change; global.warming
634,"Daily global emissions of CO2 fell by 17% at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to Covid-19, say scientists.

The most comprehensive account yet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys.

But the authors are worried that, as people return to work, car use will soar again.

They fear CO2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis.

They are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real, durable changes on transport and personal mobility.
• Coronavirus: Five charts about the biggest carbon crash

In the UK, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged £250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure. Other countries are also looking at similar plans.

The lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to Covid-19 have had a significant impact on the carbon-producing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do.

Road transport has declined hugely, as has aviation.

However, now that the UK is beginning to return to work, Mr Shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport, should walking or cycling not be an option.

""If you can't walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it rather than travelling by bus, train or tram,"" he said.

Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed.

Now in detailed analysis, researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of CO2.

They've calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97% of global emissions.

During the peak of the crisis in early April, daily emissions dropped by 17% compared to the previous year, meaning around 17 million tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day.

The key to the fall has been cars. Surface transport emissions have declined by 43%, the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined.
• How much warmer is your city?
• What is your diet's carbon footprint?
• Where we are in seven charts

While the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact, it only accounts for 10% of the decrease during the pandemic.

China has been responsible for the biggest drop, followed by the US, Europe and India.

If some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year, then global emissions will likely drop by 7%.

If pre-pandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by mid-June, the annual fall would be around 4%.

But the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound, especially on the roads, could see a carbon surge.

Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants, too. One of the UK's leading experts, Prof Frank Kelly, from King's College London, said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully two years before US authorities exposed the scandal.

He told Radio 4's The Life Scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road.

Prof Kelly said he reported it to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they didn't publish his findings. He said work undertaken subsequently in the US led to legal action against car makers that had installed ""defeat devices"" to fool regulators.

The government didn't deny the account. A spokesperson said: ""We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by the World Health Organization as an 'example for the rest of the world to follow'"".

Meanwhile, on the Covid-19 crisis, he said levels of the pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60% in London since the fall in traffic under lockdown.

Levels of another pollutant, sooty particles, remained at harmful concentrations.

""A big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work, and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before, once everybody goes back,"" said Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the University of East Anglia, who led the analysis.

The researchers say that fundamental, systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change.

When it comes to transportation, there are huge opportunities, according to Prof Le Quéré.

She says that after the global financial crisis in 2008, some governments like China, US and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables.

""Here now in 2020 we're very close to the same situation in electric mobility,"" she told BBC News.

""Battery prices have come down, we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies.""

""So if these two things can align, then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow.""
• Government to urge us all to walk and cycle more

Grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change.

A letter signed by 155 major companies, representing $2.4 trillion (£1.96 trillion) in market capitalisation, calls for a net-zero emissions response to the covid crisis.

Corporations including Carlsberg, Iberdrola, EDF and Coca Cola Europe say they want governments to ""prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy"".

The authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action. They point to the fact that while emissions of CO2 may be temporarily reduced, all the while CO2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

It will take a a dramatic shift to change that.

""I think very much that we are at a crossroads. And at this point, like the UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, it could go either way.""

""He was talking about his own health, but here we're talking about the health of the planet.""

""It could go either way.""

237,"Drowned cities; stagnant seas; intolerable heatwaves; entire nations uninhabitable… and more than 11 billion humans. A four-degree-warmer world is the stuff of nightmares and yet that’s where we’re heading in just decades.

While governments mull various carbon targets aimed at keeping human-induced global heating within safe levels – including new ambitions to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 – it’s worth looking ahead pragmatically at what happens if we fail. After all, many scientists think it’s highly unlikely that we will stay below 2C (above pre-industrial levels) by the end of the century, let alone 1.5C. Most countries are not making anywhere near enough progress to meet these internationally agreed targets.

Climate models predict we’re currently on track for a heating of somewhere between 3C and 4C for 2100, although bear in mind that these are global average temperatures – at the poles and over land (where people live), the increase may be double that. Predictions are tricky, however, as temperatures depend on how sensitive the climate is to carbon dioxide (CO ). Most models assume that it is not very sensitive – that’s where the lower 3C comes from – but a whole new set of models to be published in 2021 finds much greater sensitivity. They put heating at around 5C by the end of the century, meaning people could be experiencing as much as 10C of heating over land.

Such uncertainty isn’t ideal, but for our purposes let’s plump for an entirely feasible planetary heating of 4C by the end of the century. If that seems a long time away, consider that plenty of people you know will be around then. My children will be in their 80s, perhaps with middle-aged children and grandchildren. We are making their world and it will be a very different place.

Four degrees may not sound like much – after all, it is less than a typical temperature change between night and day. It might even sound pleasant, like retiring from the UK to southern Spain. However, an average heating of the entire globe by 4C would render the planet unrecognisable from anything humans have ever experienced. The last time the world was this hot was 15m years ago during the miocene, when intense volcanic eruptions in western North America emitted vast quantities of CO . Sea levels rose some 40 metres higher than today and lush forests grew in Antarctica and the Arctic. However, that global heating took place over many thousands of years. Even at its most rapid, the rise in CO emissions occurred at a rate 1,000 times slower than ours has since the start of the Industrial Revolution. That gave animals and plants time to adapt to new conditions and, crucially, ecosystems had not been degraded by humans.

Things look considerably bleaker for our 2100 world. Over the past decade, scientists have been able to produce a far more nuanced picture of how temperature rise affects the complexities of cloud cover and atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and ecology. We’re looking at vast dead zones in the oceans as nutrients from fertiliser runoff combine with warmer waters to produce an explosion in algae that starve marine life of oxygen. This will be exacerbated by the acidity from dissolved CO , which will cause a mass die-off, particularly of shellfish, plankton and coral. “We will have lost all the reefs decades before 2100 – at somewhere between 2C and 4C,” says Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.

Sea levels will be perhaps two metres higher and, more worryingly, we will be well on our way to an ice-free world, having passed the tipping points for the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets, committing us to at least 10 metres of sea-level rise in coming centuries. That’s because as ice sheets melt, their surface drops to a lower altitude where it is warmer, speeding up melting in a runaway feedback loop. Eventually, dark, heat-absorbing land is exposed, speeding the melting process even more. By 2100, we will also have lost most low-latitude glaciers, including two-thirds of the so called third pole of the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan mountains and Tibetan plateau that feeds many of Asia’s important rivers.

However, most rivers, especially in Asia, will flood more often, according to research by Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre, because the hotter atmosphere will produce more intense monsoons, violent storms and extreme rainfall. His studies predict a wide equatorial belt of high humidity that will cause intolerable heat stress across most of tropical Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas, rendering them uninhabitable for much of the year. Tropical forests of heat-tolerant species may well thrive in this wet zone with the high CO concentrations, especially with the disappearance of human infrastructure and agriculture, although the conditions will probably favour lianas (vines) over slower-growing trees, Betts says. To the south and north of this humid zone, bands of expansive desert will also rule out agriculture and human habitation. Some models predict that desert conditions will stretch from the Sahara right up through south and central Europe, drying rivers including the Danube and the Rhine.

In South America, the picture is more complicated: increased precipitation could enhance the Amazon rainforest, leading to mightier river flow. Other models predict a weakening of the easterlies over the Atlantic, drying the Amazon, increasing fires and turning it from forest to grassland. The tipping point for the Amazon could well be triggered by deforestation; while the intact forest could cope with some drought because it generates and maintains its own moist ecosystem, areas that have been opened up through degradation allow moisture to escape. “A combination of climate change and deforestation could push it into a savannah state,” Rockström says.

All of nature will be affected by the change in climate, ecosystems and hydrology and there will be plenty of extinctions as species struggle to migrate and adapt to an utterly changed world. Daniel Rothman, co-director of MIT’s Lorenz Center, calculates that 2100 will herald the beginning of Earth’s sixth mass extinction event. But what about us? This is undoubtedly a more hostile, dangerous world for humanity, which by 2100 will number around 11 billion, all of whom will need food, water, power and somewhere to live. It will be, in a giant understatement, problematic.

The good news is that humans won’t become extinct – the species can survive with just a few hundred individuals; the bad news is, we risk great loss of life and perhaps the end of our civilisations. Many of the places where people live and grow food will no longer be suitable for either. Higher sea levels will make today’s low-lying islands and many coastal regions, where nearly half the global population live, uninhabitable, generating an estimated 2 billion refugees by 2100. Bangladesh alone will lose one-third of its land area, including its main breadbasket.

From 2030, more than half the population will live in the tropics, an area that makes up a third of the planet and already struggles with climate impacts. Yet by 2100, most of the low and mid latitudes will be uninhabitable because of heat stress or drought; despite stronger precipitation, the hotter soils will lead to faster evaporation and most populations will struggle for fresh water. We will have to live on a smaller land surface with a larger population.

Indeed, the consequences of a 4C warmer world are so terrifying that most scientists would rather not contemplate them, let alone work out a survival strategy.

Rockström doesn’t like our chances. “It’s difficult to see how we could accommodate eight billion people or maybe even half of that,” he says. “There will be a rich minority of people who survive with modern lifestyles, no doubt, but it will be a turbulent, conflict-ridden world.”

He points out that we already use nearly half the world’s ice-free surface to produce food for 7 billion people and thinks meeting the needs of 11 billion in such hostile conditions would be impossible. “The reason is primarily making enough food, but also we would have lost the biodiversity we’re dependent on and be facing a cocktail of negative shocks all the time, from fires to droughts.”

Others are more sanguine. “I don’t think that humans as a species or even industrial civilisation is seriously threatened,” says Ken Caldeira, climatologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in California. “People live in Houston, Miami and Atlanta because they live in air conditioning through the hot summers. If people are rich enough to air-condition their lives, they can watch whatever is the successor to Game of Thrones on TV, as the natural world decays around them,” he says. But he points out that while richer people risk a loss to their quality of life, the poorer risk their actual lives.

So how might we give all of humanity the best chance?

Our best hope lies in cooperating as never before to radically reorganise our world: decoupling the political map from geography. However unrealistic it sounds, we’d need to look at the world afresh and see it in terms of where the resources are and then plan the population, food and energy production around that. It would mean abandoning huge tracts of the globe and moving Earth’s human population to the high latitudes: Canada, Siberia, Scandinavia, parts of Greenland, Patagonia, Tasmania, New Zealand and perhaps newly ice-free parts of the western Antarctic coast. If we allow 20 sq m of space per person – more than double the minimum habitable space allowed per person under English planning regulations – 11 billion people would need 220,000 sq km of land to live on. The area of Canada alone is 9.9m sq km and, combined with all the other high-latitude areas, such as Alaska, Britain, Russia and Scandinavia, there should be plenty of room for everyone.

These precious lands, with tolerable temperatures and access to water, would also be valuable food-growing areas, as well as the last oases for many species, so people would need to be housed in compact, efficient high-rise cities with reflective roofs and resource-recycling systems. That risks raising local temperatures to intolerable levels, because compact cities function as heat islands, so solar-powered cooling or even artificial winds would be needed to counteract this. There is also an increased risk of epidemics in such densely populated spaces.

Peter Cox, a climatologist at the University of Exeter, thinks this is viable, but would require a massive programme of infrastructure to manage waste, air quality and water needs. City-scale underground reservoirs could supply domestic needs and efficient recycling would keep water – and other resources – circulating in the population for years rather than hours. Post-fossil fuels, we will require unprecedented electricity production. This could come from vast arrays of solar- and wind-power plants in a belt across the uninhabitable desert regions. High-voltage direct current transmission lines could relay this power to the cities or it could be stored as thermal energy in molten salts and transported in hydrogen – after solar energy is used to split water to provide hydrogen for fuel cells.

Hydrogen production will be on an industrial scale and it could be used for nonelectric transport, for instance. Wave farms, nuclear fission (and potentially fusion) and solar power will help meet our electricity needs. In the meantime, the effective capture from the air of today’s carbon emissions will with luck be a reality; they can be stored or used in the manufacture of materials.

Food production will need to be more intensive, efficient and industrial. This will be a mostly vegetarian world, largely devoid of fish and without the grazing area or resources for livestock. Poultry may be viable on the edges of farmland and synthetic meats and other foods will meet some of the demand. Heat-tolerant, drought-resistant crop varieties, such as cassava and millet, will replace many of our current unmodified staples such as rice and wheat and they will grow faster and with greater water efficiency because of the high CO levels.

One problem is that almost all of our agriculture will need to be at higher latitudes, because the tropics will be too dry or too hot for farmworkers. And that means less land and less sunlight in winter. “Global agriculture could be limited by the geometry of Earth’s orbit around the sun,” Cox says. “However, studies have shown that crops thrive with artificial light delivered by LEDs at exactly the right frequencies for photosynthesis. This means we could grow crops through the winter months, hydroponically in smaller spaces, stacked up in warehouses or even underground, leaving valuable land surfaces for other uses.”

Cultivation of algal mats and crops grown on floating platforms and in marshland could also contribute, while crops could potentially be grown in uninhabitable regions, farmed and processed remotely by artificial farmers. Either way, we would need to use far more precise nutrient and irrigation systems to avoid polluting more fertile ecosystems and reduce food loss and waste.

A 4C warmer world may well be survivable, but it would be eminently poorer than the one we currently enjoy. Rockström believes it takes us beyond our adaptation capabilities. Delivering our children to such a deadly home is a horrifying proposition.

Given what’s at stake, it may be worth deploying geoengineering tools, which reflect the sun’s heat away from Earth, and so keep global heating to safe levels. This wouldn’t address the problem of dissolved carbon killing oceanic life, but it could buy us more time to decarbonise and achieve negative emissions. Crucially, keeping Earth cooler for longer would help the poorest people to adapt. “We have come to a point where different forms of geoengineering cannot be excluded,” admits Rockström, “but SRM [solar radiation management] is a very dangerous geopolitical tool to deploy: who decides which part of the globe to shade? How would we govern it?” he asks.

We’ve already warmed the world by 1.1C, and we’re experiencing the effects: the International Federation of the Red Cross estimates there are as many as 50 million climate refugees. Once we reach 4C, most models agree it will be impossible to return to today’s abundant world.

“For me, the issue is that we are transforming (and simplifying!) our world for many thousands of years into the future with millennia of rising sea [levels], acidified oceans and intolerable tropical temperatures, just because we weren’t willing to pay the small differential between fossil-fuelled prosperity and prosperity fuelled by non-greenhouse-gas-emitting energy systems,” says Caldeira.

We are now making the climate of 2100 and however hard it seems to meet our emissions targets, it’ll be far harder for our children if we don’t. With international cooperation and regulation, we can make it livable.

1040,"A warmer world means more and greater extremes in destructive and dangerous weather, such as heat waves, wildfires, droughts, flooding, and violent storms. There were 70 tropical cyclones or hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere in 2018, compared with the long-term average of 53. Powerful and often record-breaking storms brought devastation to the Mariana Islands, Philippines, Vietnam, Korea, and Tonga. In the U.S., hurricanes Florence and Michael caused huge economic damage and considerable loss of life, the WMO noted in its annual climate statement.

Heat waves resulted in an astounding loss in productivity in 2018, because it was often either too hot to work or even go outside safely. An incredible 153 billion hours of labour were wiped out last year due to heat waves, nearly three times more than 2000, according to the 2018 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change released November 28.

The most recent El Niño event ended in 2016, and it was associated with catastrophic coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, severe droughts in Africa, South America and parts of the Pacific and southeast Asia, and wildfires in Indonesia and Canada. While the current El Niño is not expected to be as severe, it could still bring dangerous weather to vulnerable areas around the world, scientists warn.

El Niño and its opposite, La Niña, form a natural cycle that can last from a few months to two or three years. When they occur, weather patterns around the world can be affected, producing a range of impacts on crop yields, famine, heating, and cooling demands of homes and buildings, fire risks, coral bleaching, and extreme weather. Researchers say the impacts of El Niño/La Niña events have become more severe over the past 20 years due to a warmer climate. This is akin to an athlete on steroids who takes stimulants during the Olympic final.

The combination of human-caused warming and a natural upswing in temperatures increases the odds that any new El Niño year will be the warmest ever, said climate scientist Michael Mann from Pennsylvania State University.

Mann co-authored a 2018 study linking climate change to the recent run of record-breaking droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and flooding events in the northern hemisphere. These destructive weather extremes will increase 50 percent on average and may increase as much as 300 percent due to climate change alone unless the world acts quickly to cut carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels, the study concluded.

Normally, El Niño events bring heavy rains to California, and if that happens this winter it could lead to flash flooding and mud slides after wildfires burned 1.6 million acres this autumn, said Stevenson. Nearly 14,000 homes were destroyed in those fires and now the first storms of the season have already produced flooding and mud slides.

While El Niño brings rain and cooler weather to the southern U.S., it brings heat and drought to Australia, as well as dry winter conditions in southeastern Africa and northern Brazil. Catastrophic wildfires have already broken out in eastern Australia, along with a heat wave with temperatures over 44 degrees C (111 degrees F) at the end of November.

As global warming continues future El Niño events will likely result in even cooler and wetter conditions in the U.S., enhancing flood risks. Meanwhile, La Niña events will increase wildfire danger and drought in the southwestern United States, Stevenson said.

While the impacts of El Niño/La Niña events are amplified in a warmer world, it’s not known whether climate change will affect the occurrence or strength of these events in the future, she said.

La Niña and El Niño are, respectively, the cold and warm phases of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, which regulates heat in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. In conditions defined by climatologists as ""neutral,"" high air pressure predominates in the eastern Pacific, while low pressure predominates in the west. The difference in pressure generates the trade winds, which blow east to west over the surface of the tropical Pacific, pushing the warm waters westward. The deeper, cooler waters then surface in the east, replacing the warm waters.",mainstream,M08f33,climate.change

 Climate Change Task Force Member List 



History:

The task force decided to focus on four areas of policy development:
• Climate Change Principles. These principles provide the Council with a shared statement on climate change and guide the Council's more in-depth discussions of climate change policies and approaches. View Principles.
• Technology Working Group. This group examined the various types of technologies that are currently available, under development, or anticipated that could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as examined various policies or incentives that could foster the development and dissemination of these technologies in this country and abroad. Working Group Tri-chairs: General Motors, World Resources Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy
• Working Group on Economic, Regulatory, and Voluntary Measures. This group examined a broad range of economic instruments, regulatory approaches, and voluntary steps that could be taken to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. These could include tradeable permits; tax credits/deductions for investing in improved technologies; carbon taxes; mitigation measures for economic or regional dislocations; partnerships among the investment and insurance communities, government, and industry; various regulatory approaches; and voluntary initiatives.
• Working Group on Cross-cutting Policies. Policies were identified to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases while also furthering progress in other areas of sustainable development. This working group provided a focus for drawing linkages between the Climate Change Task Force and the Council's other task forces (Environmental Management, Metropolitan/Rural Strategies for Sustainable Communities, and International) and for identifying those policies that may have benefits in more than one area. Other areas of activity include:
• Demonstrating the Implementation of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Policies and Activities
• Public outreach activities including community forums, the creation of a website, providing information to the media, and giving speeches and presentations on climate change policies and activities.
• Working with the Council's Evaluating Progress Working Group to identify indicators and measures for tracking progress in addressing the issue of climate change.

Progress Report: 

The Climate task force sent a letter to the President in November 1997 (Press Release 11/26/97) outlining its first product: a set of climate principles which were agreed upon to help the task force in its policy deliberations. In the letter, the co-chairs of the Council stated: ""This consensus statement about climate policy from industry, environmental, citizen and state and local leaders is, as far as we are aware, the first such agreement on climate policy."" The principles call for incentives for early action, international commitments, accountability, flexibility, strong measures to encourage technology, and fairness. 



 Working group meetings began in February 1998.
• 1. The Working groups developed a set of recommendations to accelerate the development and deployment of climate-friendly technology, principles for early action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and identified steps that could be taken to foster broad-based community participation to realize the benefits of climate protection. 



 2. The Climate Task Force transmitted the Early Action Principles to the President (Transmittal Letter to the President) in October 1998. See Fact Sheet and Press Release

244,"MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and Al Velshi moderate climate forum with presidential candidates and NBC News’ Lester Holt visits Alaska during the weeklong series

Al Roker Is in Greenland on NASA Mission to Study Melting Glaciers for Climate in Crisis Series

Al Roker has trekked to the Arctic yet again — this time for a NASA mission in Greenland to study the effects of climate change on the rapidly melting glaciers, and how sea levels are rising as a result.

Months after traveling to Alaska to study the effects of climate change on the northernmost part of the United States, Today’s longtime weather anchor flew in August with NASA scientists on their first-ever Oceans Melting Greenland/OMGNASA mission to study just how fast the warming ocean is melting the region’s massive ice sheets.

The intrepid Today feature anchor and co-host of the morning show’s third hour will go in-depth about his thought-provoking trip next week as part of NBC News and MSNBC’s new, weeklong Climate in Crisis series.

Starting Sunday, NBC News, MSNBC, Telemundo and NBC News Digital will dedicate the entire week’s programming to the climate crisis, showing how rapid changes in our environment are affecting us here in the U.S. and in the rest of the world.

During the series, NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt will report from Alaska, where he lived as a child while his father served in the U.S. Air Force. He will show how warming temperatures are melting the state’s famed Portage Glacier and thawing the permafrost, which countless communities depend on to survive.

“We’re seeing a shift in our very way of life because of climate change,” Roker, 65, tells PEOPLE. “We’re not trying to frighten people. We’re trying to show people how this affects your everyday life and in ways big and small.”

“We were out with folks who had been on a glacier that was retreating at the rate of 10 to 15 feet a week,” he says.

As part of the Climate in Crisis series, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and Ali Velshi will moderate Climate Forum 2020, a two-day event where U.S. presidential candidates talk with young voters about their plans to lead the country — and the world — into an uncertain future.

Hosted by MSNBC, Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, Our Daily Planet and New York magazine, Hayes says he is interested to hear exactly how the candidates will tackle the climate crisis.

Velshi, 49, says he wants to help viewers gain a more sophisticated understanding of where the candidates stand on the climate crisis. He also wants to ask the candidates what they think the world will look like in 2030 or 2050.

“In other words, how seriously do you take this?” he says. “There are implications in healthcare, in immigration, in national security, in nutrition — everywhere about this. I want to get a sense from these candidates about how they see it and more importantly, how do you convince people for whom climate change might be a fact but it’s not a priority?”

Velshi says he saw the effects of climate change firsthand in the Bahamas, where he reported from the Abaco islands, which were “reduced to rubble” by Hurricane Dorian.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A federal appeals court on Friday dismissed a lawsuit by 21 young people who claimed the U.S. government’s climate policies and reliance on fossil fuels harms them, jeopardizes their future and violates their constitutional rights, potentially dealing a fatal blow to a long-running case that activists saw as an important front in the war against environmental degradation.

The Oregon-based youth advocacy group Our Children’s Trust filed the lawsuit in 2015 in Eugene on behalf of the youngsters. It sought an injunction ordering the government to implement a plan to phase out fossil fuel emissions and draw down atmospheric carbon dioxide emission. The case had bounced around the federal courts for five years and multiple trial dates were canceled.

The 2-1 vote for dismissal by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was a serious setback for the climate activists, who vowed to ask the full 9th Circuit panel to review the ruling. Our Children’s Trust has filed numerous similar cases in state and federal courts and currently has nine cases pending in state courts from Alaska to New Mexico. The federal ruling was less likely to impact those cases, experts said.

“This is a very serious blow to the case, perhaps a fatal blow,” said Jennifer Rushlow, an associate dean for environmental programs at Vermont Law School, who has been watching the case closely.

Our Children’s Trust said in a statement that although the justices ruled for dismissal, it was important to note that they also said in the opinion that the evidence showed climate change was real and caused by fossil fuels and that the young plaintiffs had suffered legitimate consequences from climate change.

The “case is far from over,” said Julia Olson, lead attorney for Our Children’s Trust. “The court recognized that climate change is exponentially increasing and that the federal government has long known that its actions substantially contribute to the climate crisis.”

Government attorneys repeatedly sought the case’s dismissal and succeeded in having the scope of the claims narrowed and some defendants dismissed during years of back-and-forth litigation.

On Friday, the court wrote that the youngsters made a compelling case that action is needed and agreed that climate change is undeniable, but said the proper venue for addressing the nation’s emissions policies and fossil fuel use is the U.S. Congress or the executive branch.

In addition, the justices wrote that ending the use of fossil fuels in the U.S. alone — which is what the plaintiffs sought — would not be enough to slow or stop climate change.

“That’s the heartbreaking thing about this opinion. The 9th Circuit recognizes that climate change is an existential threat … and agrees that the political branches have not done enough to address this problem in the past and are unlikely to do so in the future. But the court just feels it’s in a really difficult situation,” said Cara Horowitz, co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.

The youths, who were between the ages of 8 and 18 when the lawsuit was filed in 2015, tied specific incidents that had affected their lives to climate change and U.S. government policies. In one instance, a young woman said she was forced to leave her home on a Navajo reservation because of water scarcity, separating her from her relatives. Another — the youngest plaintiff — said storms driven by climate change have hurt his home, a barrier island off the Florida coast that’s just 13 feet (3.96 meters) above sea level. Still others cite health impacts, such as worsening asthma attacks from air pollution.

The plaintiffs come from all over the U.S., from Oregon to Louisiana to New York.

The sole dissenting justice, Josephine Staton, wrote that “my colleagues throw up their hands.”

“No case can singlehandedly prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change predicted by the government and scientists. ... and the mere fact that this suit cannot alone halt climate change does not mean that it presents no claim suitable for judicial resolution,” Staton wrote in her dissent.

380,"The planet is in hot water — literally — and that will have dire consequences for humanity, warns a new United Nations report on the state of the world’s oceans and ice.

Over the next century, climate change will make the oceans warmer and more acidic. Melting ice sheets will drive up sea levels at an accelerating pace. Marine heat waves will become 20 to 50 times more frequent, harming sensitive ecosystems. And the total biomass of animals in the sea could drop by as much as 15%, according to the sobering assessment by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

“The oceans and ice are in trouble, so we’re all in trouble,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton and a lead author of the report.

But while some damage is inevitable at this point, the report makes clear that society’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades will determine how bad things ultimately get.

It’s “the difference between an unmanageable problem and one that humans can deal with,” Oppenheimer said.

The analysis, released Wednesday at a meeting of scientists and policymakers in Monaco, follows close on the heels of the U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York, which failed to elicit ambitious commitments from the world’s biggest polluters. Yet the report underscores just how costly delaying action will be.

Thus far, the world’s oceans have been the quiet hero of our warming world. They have absorbed about a quarter of the carbon dioxide humans have pumped into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial revolution, and 90% of the resulting heat.

“But it can’t keep up,” said Ko Barrett, the deputy administrator for research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a vice chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

The report illustrates how climate change has already started to alter the chemistry and circulation of the oceans, and how that exacts a heavy toll on marine ecosystems. Coastal communities, which will be home to a billion people by 2050, are also feeling the impacts, starting with rising seas.

Over the last century, sea level rise was primarily driven by runoff from melting mountain glaciers in places like Alaska and the Andes, as well as by the expansion of seawater as it warmed. Now, however, the massive ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have taken over as the largest contributors, and they are increasing sea levels faster than ever.

Since 2006, sea levels have risen at a rate of 0.14 of an inch per year — more than double the rate over the previous century.

The big question is what will happen next.

Based on new research since the last IPCC assessment came out in 2014, the authors increased their estimates of projected future sea levels.

Compared with the turn of the 21st century, sea levels will increase about 1.5 feet by 2100 and will rise a total of 3 feet by the year 2300 — if society rapidly reduces greenhouse gases.

That will present plenty of challenges, “but things will evolve slowly, giving humans plenty of time to plan,” Oppenheimer said.

On the other hand, if countries fail to curb emissions in the next few decades, the world will see about 3 feet of sea level rise by the end of the century — and much more after that.

In the worst-case scenario, in which parts of the Antarctic ice sheet start to collapse, we could be in for as much as 17 feet of sea level rise by 2300. That would probably outpace society’s ability to adapt, Oppenheimer said.

No one knows exactly where the tipping point lies, but scientists have already seen troubling signs of rapid ice loss in places like Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier, which alone contains enough water to raise sea levels by 2 feet.

“That is very worrying,” said Regine Hock, a glaciologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and an author of the report. “The indications are there that instability might be on its way.” (Hock also coordinated a chapter on high-mountain areas, which looked at the impacts of shrinking glaciers and snowpacks on ecosystems and communities.)

Regardless of how much sea levels rise over the long term, they will cause problems for coastal communities in the short term because of increasingly devastating storm surges and high tides.

By 2050, flood events that used to occur only once a century will happen at least once every year in many places in the world, even under a best-case scenario, according to the report. In fact, one study found that so-called 100-year floods will occur in Los Angeles about five times per year by mid-century.

On top of that, hurricanes will intensify, and extreme El Niño and La Niña events — which have profound impacts on California’s weather — are forecast to happen twice as often by the end of the century. That’s true no matter how quickly countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Many of these episodes will be unlike anything in living memory, and will require communities to plan for unprecedented impacts. “If we do business as usual, we won’t be prepared for them,” said So-Min Cheong, a human geographer at the University of Kansas and an author of the report.

The assessment also looked at how climate change is affecting fish populations and the communities that depend on them.

Warming waters have put many marine animals on the move, and range shifts are expected to become more pronounced in the future. One analysis found that some fish species along the West Coast could migrate as much as 600 miles north under a high-emissions scenario. (Creatures that can’t relocate, like corals, could simply be eradicated.)

Some animals will thrive in their new homes and others will hit dead ends, forcing fishing industries to adapt. But on the whole, unmitigated climate change will decrease the potential catch of global fisheries by 20%, the report concluded.

Tropical countries will be hit the hardest, in part because many communities depend heavily on the ocean for their livelihood, said Katie Matthews, chief scientist at the nonprofit organization Oceana, who was not involved in the report. As with sea level rise, however, the extent of the damage depends on how quickly society acts to reduce emissions, she said.

A recent study found that meeting the goals of the Paris climate accord — which are to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius — would protect 3 million tons of the most lucrative fish catches. These gains would benefit developing countries the most.

The report authors called on governments to protect ecosystems and people from these impacts. It emphasized the need to slash greenhouse gas emissions, and to reduce other stresses on marine animals to give them breathing room to adapt to climate change.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to making coastal communities more resilient, Cheong said, but governments could help by improving early warning systems for disasters, encouraging residents to plan for climate change when they rebuild, or, in some cases, consider retreating altogether. The report highlighted the need to start adapting now for an uncertain future.

“We owe it to our children and future generations to plan for resilient communities while we can,” said Jack Ainsworth, executive director of the California Coastal Commission. “History will judge us harshly if we do nothing or take halfhearted steps.”

In Oppenheimer’s view, the U.S. is particularly far behind. The National Flood Insurance Program gives people an incentive to remain where they will be vulnerable to future storms, and the government’s reactive approach means that there is often no money for adaptation until after a disaster has struck.

“These communities along the coast are basically sitting ducks,” he said.

But there are also reasons to be hopeful. The ocean holds the potential to accomplish roughly a quarter of the greenhouse gas reductions needed to meet the Paris climate targets, according to a report released Monday by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, a group of scientists and world leaders convened by the World Resources Institute.

For instance, seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangrove habitats can sequester huge amounts of what scientists call “blue carbon.” Preserving and restoring them yields other benefits too, like buffering coastlines from storms and serving as nurseries for economically important fish.

Oceans can also help by providing climate-friendly foods. As the IPCC’s last major report on land use pointed out, eating beef and other land-based meats is a significant driver of climate change. But fish is a green alternative.

Many fisheries are already overexploited. But researchers say that smart management could boost yields and be sustainable.

“You can get more out of the ocean if you just pay attention and manage it properly,” Matthews said.

Even so, there’s no escaping the grim picture painted by the IPCC report. If climate change continues unabated, “the consequences for humanity are sweeping and severe,” Barrett said.

“What’s at stake is the health of ecosystems, wildlife and — importantly — the world we leave our children.”",mainstream,M0e504,climate.change
247,"The overwhelming consensus on climate change is human activity is responsible for the warming of the planet. There is, however, some concern recent climate predictions may have been unrealistic in their forecasts of the future. A study at the University of Michigan, US, has found one of the world's leading models may be too sensitive to carbon dioxide (CO2) increases.

As a result, the climate model, known as CESM2, may be projecting warming that is unrealistically high.

The claim was presented in a letter scheduled for publication on April 30 in the journal Nature Climate Change.

According to the letter, the CESM2's projections do not appear to be supported by geological evidence.

The geological evidence relates to a previous period of global warming observed about 50 million years ago.

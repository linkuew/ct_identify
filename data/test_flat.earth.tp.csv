But no NN told its system exactly how to do DT . After YouTube built DT system WDT recommends videos to its users , former employees IN Guillaume Chaslot , a software engineer in artificial intelligence who worked on DT site 's recommendation engine in 2010 - 2011 , VBD he watched as PRP started pushing users toward NN videos . Chaslot VBD DT platform ’s complex “ machine learning ” system , which uses trial and error combined with statistical analysis to figure out how to VB NNS to watch more videos , figured out IN DT best way to VB NNS to spend more NN on YouTube was to show them videos light on facts but rife with wild speculation . Routine searches on YouTube can generate quality , personalized recommendations WDT lead to good information , exciting storytelling from independent voices , and authoritative NN sources . But PRP can RB return recommendations for videos WDT assert , for example , IN DT NNP is flat , aliens are underneath Antarctica , and mass shooting survivors are crisis actors . This is n’t just a YouTube problem . Chaslot ’s research on YouTube , which he released earlier this NN , added to growing concerns about DT pervasiveness of similar algorithms throughout modern society . “ PRP ’re used to give PRP a credit score , to decide whether PRP VBP a job interview , evaluate your college application . PRP all use algorithms , ” VBD data scientist Cathy O’Neil , author of “ Weapons of Math Destruction . ” “ All those bureaucratic decision - making systems , ” use algorithms , she VBD , even as part of DT criminal sentencing process . Several NNS are using these computer models to decide lengths of prison NN or set bail amounts — which some critics have accused of perpetuating racial bias . Algorithms trained by human data are now present in DT daily lives of billions of NNS . And 2.2 billion of them are on YouTube . On DT site , DT ease with which a person on can be transported from any innocuous search to DT lunatic fringe of YouTube is startling . This reporter was helping his son research outer space for his school project . When he searched for "" Saturn , "" DT first results were mostly documentaries . CD of DT recommended videos was "" 10 facts PRP did n't VB about space . "" DT video led to additional recommendations such as "" can PRP believe PRP "" videos , a synthesized voice reading Nostradamus predictions and a clip "" PRP do n't VB PRP to see "" of pro-Putin propaganda . What had started out as a simple search for fun NN facts for kindergartners had quickly led to a vast NN ecosystem . Every day YouTube serves around CD billion users who watch billions of hours of video . NNS use PRP to search for DT latest music videos , learn how to fix their car and write research papers . DT site ’s videos RB make PRP into Google search results , expanding their reach to potentially billions of searches per day . YouTube , as CD of our primary windows into DT NN , is shaping our understanding of PRP . DT massive amounts of information available inside has led CEO Susan Wojcicki to call DT site a “ library . ” And YouTube is just part of PRP . Google ’s search algorithm and Facebook ’s NN Feed algorithm RB serve as filters for information for billions of NNS . “ EX is an infrastructure built since DT Renaissance to ensure DT integrity of information and knowledge in libraries , JJ layers of gatekeepers thick , ” wrote David Carroll , an associate professor of NN design at DT NNP School and a known critic of online platforms , in an email . “ PRP$ Tube dispenses with all of PRP in DT name of frictionless content acquisition and an algorithm optimized for watch - NN to sell ads . ” Chaslot , a software engineer in artificial intelligence , worked on a project to introduce diversity to YouTube ’s video recommendations starting in 2010 . PRP did n’t do as well for watch NN , he VBD , so PRP was shut down and not used . "" This is dangerous because this is an algorithm WDT 's gaslighting NNS to make them believe IN everybody lies to them just for DT sake of watch NN , "" he VBD . He was moved to another group but tried to keep DT original project VBG . According to a YouTube spokesperson , Chaslot was eventually fired in 2013 over performance issues . Once on DT outside , Chaslot VBD he created a program to analyze how DT algorithm was recommending NN videos by using a YouTube account with no viewing history to search for certain topics and collect which videos were recommended to users most . This means IN while “ good ” or “ harmless ” videos might be included in DT mix of recommendations , YouTube repeatedly invited users to click on certain videos much more than others , essentially giving them free advertising . Chaslot initially shared his research with DT Guardian . His analysis found IN when searching for "" Is DT NNP flat or round ? "" DT top recommendation YouTube kept showing users in DT beginning of February was "" DT BEST Flat NNP VIDEO | 100 % Proof DT NNP Is Flat | Please Debunk This I Dare PRP !!!! ” followed by "" Top 10 Reasons NNS Believe DT NNP Is FLAT ! "" and "" BEST FLAT NNP PROOF 2017 - PRP CANT DENY THIS EVIDENCE . "" Searching tragedies can turn up even more disturbing results . If PRP searched for “ Sandy Hook Shooting ” in November 2017 , CD of DT top recommended videos was DT now removed "" BELIEVE YOUR OWN EYES - 9/11 - ' NO PLANES ' , "" followed by videos asserting DT Connecticut school shooting and its victims were a hoax . Researchers at Harvard conducted their own test and found IN DT algorithm was more often drawing viewers to extreme content and unfounded right - wing NN theories . Experts say DT NN videos are perfectly positioned to push our buttons and draw PRP in to consume more of them — signs WDT YouTube ’s algorithm prioritizes , wrote Robert J. Blaskiewicz Jr. , a columnist for DT Committee for Skeptical Inquiry , a non-profit educational organization WDT applies scientific analysis to NN theory claims , in an email . "" NN stories hit our emotional fight or flight triggers , ” Blaskiewicz wrote . “ And DT stories rest on DT unstated premise IN knowledge of DT NN will protect PRP from being manipulated . This in itself compels NNS to watch and absorb as much as PRP can and to revisit videos . "" DT emotion PRP provoke is contagious , he VBD , and PRP provide ready - made explanations for complex and difficult NN events . YouTube has VBN PRP 's simply reflecting what users VBP to see , and videos are chosen based on their individual profile and viewing history . Publicly , executives have VBN IN DT recommendations algorithm drives over 70 percent of content watched on YouTube , and IN PRP ’re getting better and better at PRP all DT NN . “ Our job is to give DT user a steady stream , almost a synthetic or personalized channel , "" YouTube 's chief product officer , Neal Mohan , VBD at CES , DT annual consumer tech conference , in Las Vegas in January . "" Higher watch NN means more ad inventory , "" VBD Austin Moldow , an equity researcher at Canaccord Genuity , a financial services firm in NNP York . "" More ads , more revenue . "" But just because NNS are willing to watch something does n’t mean PRP ’re enjoying PRP . YouTube has to balance protecting its profits with DT trust of its users . Fail to walk DT line and PRP can begin to undermine user value , VBD Kara Swisher , Recode executive editor and MSNBC contributor . "" I VBP PRP 's a problem not just throughout Youtube , but Google , Facebook , all these companies is IN PRP prioritize growth over anything else . PRP MD not be meaning to do PRP , but if growth is DT goal , then user experience is not DT goal , ” VBD Swisher . “ Real users , DT ones PRP ’re trying to attract , VB away . And so PRP 's in all their interests from a business point of view to clean this place up and to have more control over PRP and EX 's a moral responsibility to create a platform WDT is n't being abused by anybody ” “ Good advertisers do n't wanna be next to these kind of videos either , ” she added . Exploiting DT YouTube algorithm is a cottage industry . Video creators who follow DT rules can earn a share of advertising revenue . Trends favored by DT algorithm are quickly incorporated and uploaded by savvy creators , VBD Becca Lewis , a researcher at Data & Society , a nonprofit based in NNP York . Ultimately , if DT recommendation engine is promoting NN videos , YouTube incentivizes creating more of them . But more than just promoting — and prioritizing — misinformation , these digital tabloid channels can RB distort democracy . Right before DT 2016 U.S. presidential election , Chaslot 's research found more than 80 percent of DT recommended videos favored Donald NNP . Searching "" NNP "" lead to pro-Trump video recommendations . Searching "" NNP "" raised mainly anti-Clinton video recommendations . YouTube has taken steps to reduce incentives for some of DT worst offenders . Content IN mass shootings are not allowed to generate advertising revenue for their creators through YouTube . However , this does n’t stop creators from including links for direct donations in their video descriptions , their online merchandise stores , affiliate links for apps or paid mentions within DT videos . In a statement to NBC NNP , a YouTube spokesperson VBD “ our recommendation system has changed substantially over NN and no longer works DT way PRP did five NNS ago . ” While PRP used to optimize for “ watch NN , ” PRP now has begun to shift focus to “ satisfaction , ” balancing watch NN with additional data points such as likes , dislikes , shares , and surveys . YouTube has RB tweaked its algorithm to better show authoritative NN sources , especially for breaking NN events , DT spokesperson VBD . According to YouTube , none of DT recommendation system WDT Chaslot worked on while he was at Google is being used today . Critics fear IN a few updates wo n’t resolve DT core issue , VBD Tristan Harris , who previously worked as a Google design ethicist and is now a critic of his ex-employer , leading a JJ group of former technologists out of San Francisco called DT Center for Humane Technology . Using algorithms creates exponential solutions , CD for every customer or citizen , but RB exponential problems . “ PRP can't possibly have exponential consequences with exponential responsibility unless PRP have an exponential amount of human thought to be dedicated to those challenges , ” VBD Harris . “ And PRP ca n't put DT just into an algorithm . ”"

Possible versions range from misread instruments leading to a stall to a murder - suicide . AirAsia flight QZ8501 abruptly went off radar on Sunday over DT Java NNP shortly after DT pilot requested air control in Jakarta for permission to climb higher to avoid a storm . DT permission was granted two minutes later , but no response from DT crew followed . DT plane disappeared from radar screens three minutes later . No distress call was sent by DT plane . Both facts indicated IN PRP fell very quickly , with initial speculation saying IN PRP MD have suffered catastrophic destruction in mid-air . But DT discovery of DT plane ’s body lying in CD piece on DT seabed proved otherwise . Recovering data from flight and cockpit recorders MD be crucial for establishing DT truth about DT fate of QZ8501 , but some flight experts point out IN DT AirAsia Airbus A320 crash has similarities with another flight incident , DT of Air France flight AF447 in 2009 . DT plane was officially classed as missing for two NNS and was found only in 2011 . DT investigation showed instruments called pitot tubes froze and gave false airspeed readings to DT crew . PRP failed to respond to DT problem accordingly and did n’t notice IN DT plane was about to stall or to try to recover PRP . No two accidents are DT same . But EX are similar conditions IN DT weather , and PRP must look into PRP very closely , ” a former air crash investigator in Indonesia told Reuters . Unlike DT AirAsia flight crash , Air France airliner stalled at nighttime when DT crew MD n’t see DT horizon line and see IN DT aircraft was losing altitude . QZ8501 was piloted by an experienced 53 - NN - old ex-Indonesian Air Force pilot known by DT single name Iriyanto , who had 20,000 flying hours under his belt , including 6,100 hours in Airbuses . DT co-pilot was Frenchman Remi Plesel with 2,275 flying hours . AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes expressed confidence in his pilot , saying he was CD of DT best graduates at his military flight school . DT Airbus A320 is a reliable aircraft with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs , according to a safety NN published by Boeing in August . With neither human error nor technical failure immediately pinned down as a likely cause , more sinister theories about DT crash have arisen . DT plane MD have been damaged by a small bomb exploding onboard , John Nance , a former NNP Air Force pilot , told ABC NNP . “ Maybe CD WDT was n’t strong enough to blow DT airplane into pieces at altitude , but maybe CD WDT blew DT control cables from DT hydraulics , ” he VBD . An even more exotic version MD be a deliberate crash by DT pilot in a murder - suicide , Nance added . At least three crashes in DT past 20 NNS were caused by this . CD example is SilkAir Flight 185 , RB from Indonesia , which crashed into a river in southern Sumatra in 1997 . Indonesian investigators reported IN PRP MD n’t collect conclusive evidence to rule on DT cause of DT incident . But DT NNP National Transportation Safety Board , which participated in DT investigation because DT aircraft in question was a Boeing 737 , VBD DT plane crashed due to deliberate input from DT cockpit , most likely by DT captain ."

Budget proposals unveiled by NNP NNP MD slash funding for NN research . Thoughtfully , NNP politicians are eager to fill in DT looming knowledge gap with their own free - spirited theories . National NNP Radio reports IN Republican senator Scott Wagner told constituents in Pennsylvania “ I have n’t been in a NN class in a long NN ” – at which point any sensible politician MD have stopped talking – “ but DT NNP moves closer to DT sun every NN , PRP VBP , DT rotation of DT NNP . ” Adding to his alarming heliocentric model , Wagner VBD , “ PRP have more NNS . PRP VBP , humans have warm bodies . So is heat coming off ? Things are changing , but I VBP PRP are , as a society , doing DT best PRP can . ” Feedback can only speculate IN DT more researchers PRP send to DT Arctic , DT faster PRP seems to melt . Coincidence ? “ Something smells fishy about Marks & Spencer ’s Coastal Walk scented candle , with its “ fragrance of fresh coastal air ” , says Max Glaskin . “ Maybe PRP ’s DT fact IN PRP is RB “ harmful to aquatic life ” ” IS NNP spherical , IN a basketball , or flat IN DT court DT game is played on ? DT jury is still out for several NNP sports stars , who voiced their doubts about geosphericism last month ( 1 April ) . “ I thought PRP ’d VB to VB about DT Flat NNP International Conference 2017 , ” writes Bob Lang . “ Apparently delegates will be arriving from around DT NN to VB RB . ” Held in North Carolina this November , DT Flat Earthers meeting features JJ keynote speakers PRP MD recognise from rambling YouTube videos filled with badly drawn diagrams and DT palpable frustration of not being taken seriously . DT will end soon though , because DT conference has thrown down DT gauntlet to DT NN of NN . A Facebook page headed by a description of DT minutiae of “ Satan ’s globe NNP lie ” ( to wit : “ PRP evolved from primordial soup . PRP are specks in DT universe . Some NNS are more valuable than others . ” ) brings NN IN niche imprint Sacred Word Publishing is offering DT oddly specific sum of $ 8250 to anyone who can successfully demonstrate IN NNP is round , using two original experiments . Yes , NNP MD stand still , but DT burden of proof can easily be hoisted onto your opponent ’s shoulders . “ PRP ca n’t be beyond DT wit of Feedback readers to pick up this particular challenge , ” says Bob . And not only will this prove IN Satan ’s globe NNP lie is a reality after all , PRP will demonstrate some NNS really are worth more than others – specifically , $ 8250 more . TAKING a pragmatic approach to DT problem of spelling words out with single letters from DT periodic table ( 18 February ) , Andy Ward spies an opportunity . “ DT periodic table contains no element beginning with J or Q , ” he says , “ I suggest IN when element 119 is made PRP should be named quasimodium . ” Perhaps an opportunity for researchers at DT University of Notre Dame in Indiana ? Element 120 , meanwhile , “ should be called janskium after Karl Jansky DT radio - astronomer , as PRP MD appear directly below radium . ” Which MD leave PRP just 10 letters short of an alphabetically complete periodic table , but promisingly , only four short of spelling “ ISLAND OF STABILITY ” . KLEE IRWIN is a man who made a small fortune selling NN supplements such as “ Colon Clear ” , although not as much as he MD have were PRP not for a 2011 lawsuit WDT fined his company $ 2.65 million for false and misleading advertising , plus DT small matter of selling a supplement WDT contained 14 times DT legal limit of lead . A rehabilitated Irwin has now pivoted into theoretical physics , a field in which fantastical claims with scant supporting evidence can still boast a degree of respectability . His Quantum Gravity Research group is seeking to build a JJ , first - principles unified theory of everything PRP call Emergence Theory , “ to unify , through mathematical and scientific rigor , DT theory of relativity , quantum mechanics … and consciousness . ” Presumably frozen out by mainstream research funders , Irwin is calling for donations via DT Quantum Gravity Group ’s web page – after all , particle colliders do n’t build themselves . But does DT NN need a JJ theory of everything ? DT letters inbox at NNP Scientist receives at least CD a week – perhaps PRP MD do with a dose Colon Clear . TAKEN aback by DT creative uses for afterbirth ( 1 April ) , Frank Cross writes to say “ When I was a lad , DT placentas were fed to matron ’s cat . ” This strikes PRP as both practical and economical . But Feedback is n’t sure IN a cat with a taste for human flesh is DT best pet to have strolling freely around a maternity ward . JOHN HOW is left puzzling over an information card attached to his JJ laptop adaptor . “ Electricity travels at 300,000 kilometres per second , ” PRP tells him . “ If PRP MD move DT fast , PRP ’d be able to race around DT NN eight times in DT NN PRP takes to turn on a light . ” If PRP MD move around DT NN RB fast , why MD PRP need lights anyway ?"

PRP can read her piece on hell here . My pious Baptist grandmother once shockingly confessed , at DT ripe old age of 93 , IN she did n’t VB to VB to heaven . “ Why , ” PRP asked ? “ Well , I VBP PRP will be rather boring just sitting around on clouds and singing hymns all day ” she answered . She had a point . Mark Twain might have agreed with her assessment . He once famously quipped IN PRP should choose “ heaven for DT NN , hell for DT company ” . Most of PRP have some concept of heaven , even if PRP is CD formed by movies IN What Dreams MD Come , DT Lovely Bones , or VB PRP involves meeting Morgan Freeman in a white room . And while not as complicated as biblical ideas about hell , DT biblical concept of heaven is not particularly simple either . In DT Christian tradition , heaven and paradise have been conflated as an answer to DT question “ where do I VB when I die ? ” DT idea of DT dead being in heaven or enjoying paradise often brings enormous comfort to DT bereaved and hope to those suffering or dying . Yet heaven and paradise were originally more about where God lived , not about PRP or our ultimate destination . DT words for heaven or heavens in both Hebrew ( shamayim ) and Greek ( ouranos ) can RB be translated as sky . PRP is not something WDT exists eternally but rather part of creation . DT first line of DT Bible VBZ IN heaven is created along with DT creation of DT NN ( Genesis 1 ) . PRP is primarily God ’s dwelling place in DT biblical tradition : a parallel realm where everything operates according to God ’s will . Heaven is a place of peace , love , community , and worship , where God is surrounded by a heavenly court and other heavenly beings . Biblical authors imagined DT NN as a flat place with Sheol below ( DT realm of DT dead ) and a dome over DT NN WDT separates PRP from DT heavens or sky above . Of course , PRP VBP DT NN is not flat , and this three - tiered universe makes no sense to a modern mind . Even so , DT concept of heaven ( wherever PRP is located ) continues in Christian theology as DT place where God dwells and a theological claim WDT this NN is not all WDT EX is . DT other main metaphor for God ’s dwelling place in DT Bible is paradise . According to Luke ’s version of DT crucifixion , Jesus converses with DT men on either side of him while waiting to die and promises DT man on a neighbouring cross “ today PRP will be with me in paradise ” . References to paradise in DT Bible are likely due to DT influence of Persian culture and particularly Persian Royal gardens ( paridaida ) . Persian walled gardens were known for their beautiful layout , diversity of plant life , walled enclosures , and being a place where DT royal family might safely walk . PRP were effectively a paradise on NN . DT garden of Eden in Genesis 2 is strikingly similar to a Persian Royal garden or paradise . PRP has abundant NN sources in DT rivers WDT run through PRP , fruit and plants of every kind for food , and PRP is “ pleasing to DT eye ” . God dwells RB , or at least visits , and talks with Adam and Eve IN a King might in a royal garden . Read more : Friday essay : what might heaven be JJ ? In DT grand mythic stories WDT make up DT Bible , humans are thrown out of Eden due to their disobedience . And so begins a narrative about human separation from DT divine and how humans find their way back to God and God ’s dwelling ( paradise ) . In DT Christian tradition , Jesus is DT means of return . DT Easter event WDT Christians celebrate around DT globe at this NN of NN is about DT resurrection of Jesus after his violent death on DT cross three days earlier . Jesus ’ resurrection is seen as DT promise , DT “ first - fruits ” of what is possible for all humans – resurrection to an eternal life with God . This is , of course , a matter of faith not something WDT can be proven . But reconciliation with God lies at DT heart of DT Easter story . DT last book of DT Bible , Revelation , conflates DT idea of heaven and paradise . DT author describes a vision of a JJ , re-created heaven coming down to NN . PRP is not escapism from this NN but rather an affirmation of all WDT is created , material , and earthly but now healed and renewed . This final biblical vision of heaven is a lot IN DT garden of Eden – complete with DT Tree of Life , rivers , plants and God – although this NN PRP is RB an urban , multicultural city . In what is essentially a return to Eden , humans are reconciled with God and , of course , with CD another . Heaven or paradise in DT Bible is a utopian vision , designed not only to inspire faith in God but RB in DT hope IN NNS might embody DT values of love and reconciliation in this NN ."

Instead of forming a relatively flat disk , DT hundreds of billions of stars WDT make up DT Milky Way form a disk WDT 's noticeably twisted at DT edges , a bit IN a flattened letter "" S . "" "" I 'd say IN PRP is shaped IN a Pringle , "" VBD NN co-author Radek Poleski , an astronomer at Ohio NNP University in Columbus . For decades , astronomers assumed IN DT Milky Way was relatively flat , IN most other spiral galaxies ( DT Milky Way is a so - called barred spiral galaxy , a whirlpool of stars and interstellar clouds with a bright bar across DT middle ) . DT JJ research , which was published Aug. 2 in DT journal NNP , confirms recent research showing IN DT galaxy is warped but RB shows IN DT distortion is more pronounced than astronomers had suspected . DT Milky Way is estimated to have a diameter of just over 100,000 light - NNS , and our solar system is embedded within PRP about 25,000 light - NNS from DT galaxy 's center . So PRP 's hard to see DT bend from our vantage point — and vast clouds of interstellar gas and dust within DT galaxy make DT task even harder , Poleski VBD . But Poleski and astronomers at DT University of Warsaw in Poland created a JJ super - detailed map of DT Milky Way using so - called variable stars known as classical Cepheids , which brighten and dim over a period of days at a rate corresponding to their size . At their brightest , classical Cepheids can be 10,000 brighter than our sun , so PRP 're visible across vast distances and through DT clouds of gas and dust . Using observational data from DT Optical Gravitational Lens Experiment ( OGLE ) , an ongoing survey of stars in DT southern sky made using a specialized telescope in Chile 's Atacama Desert , DT astronomers determined accurate positions for more than 2,400 classical Cepheid stars by comparing DT light PRP were known to produce with DT light from them seen here on NNP . "" When PRP measure DT period of a star , PRP VBP how much absolute light PRP emits , "" Poleski VBD . "" Then PRP can compare PRP with DT light WDT PRP are getting , and by comparing those two PRP VBP DT distance . "" What explains our galaxy 's weird shape ? Richard de Grijs , an astronomer at MacQuarrie University in Sydney , Australia , attributed PRP to DT effects of gravitational interactions with neighboring galaxies . PRP 's RB possible IN our galaxy twisted as PRP merged with smaller galaxies in DT distant past , he VBD , or IN its warped shape is DT result of DT combined gravity of DT spiral arms themselves , which MD pull stars and clouds at DT edges away from DT flat plane of DT rest of DT galaxy . De Grijs , who was part of a team who measured DT galaxy 's bend in research published earlier this NN , VBD DT JJ NN confirmed and expanded upon DT earlier research . "" PRP found pretty much DT same result , which is comforting , "" he told NBC NNP MACH in an email .

See_VB TIME_NNP 's_POS Pictures_NNPS of_IN the_DT Week_NNP ._.",""" Lights All Askew in DT Heavens , "" proclaimed a headline in DT NNP York Times on Nov. 10 , 1919 . DT reason : results had just come in from DT very first test of Albert Einstein 's JJ general theory of relativity . "" Men of NN More or Less Agog over Results of Eclipse Observations , "" DT headline continued , in what passed for breathless excitement back then . DT key theory WDT had DT NNS so giddy was Einstein 's claim IN space and NN were elastic , and MD be warped and stretched IN taffy . DT test WDT proved PRP involved observing stars whose position in DT sky makes them appear to be close to DT sun and measuring whether solar gravity warped space - NN enough to distort DT starlight slightly . A 1919 solar eclipse allowed NNS to see DT stars clearly and make DT necessary measurements  proving IN DT great man 's theories were correct . PRP might VB IN when a scientific finding has n't been seriously challenged for 93 NNS DT matter MD be pretty much settled , but experimentalists have been poking and prodding Einstein 's premises ever since . EX 's more than just stubborn skepticism at work : some of relativity 's more esoteric implications are fiendishly hard to confirm , so DT physicists keep devising more and more sensitive and difficult studies  even though DT theory keeps passing them all . Which explains a recent announcement out of NASA headquarters . After no fewer than seven cancellations , followed by seven reprieves , DT space agency 's orbiting Gravity Probe B mission , or GP - B for short , has at last confirmed not CD , but two of relativity 's more subtle predictions  and PRP took only 51 NNS and three - quarters of a billion dollars to do PRP . To understand what DT probe found , PRP first need to VB about space - NN , DT four - dimensional stage on which everything in DT universe plays out . What PRP VBP of as gravity , Einstein VBD , is n't a force WDT pulls two objects toward each other . Rather , PRP 's a warping of space - NN itself WDT makes objects VB to move . DT classic real - NN analogy is a bowling ball on a trampoline : DT ball makes DT trampoline 's surface dip . DT 's something vaguely IN DT way a star or a NN makes space - NN warp . DT big difference is IN space - NN is n't a flat surface , but something WDT fills DT universe . This makes DT warping pretty much impossible to visualize , even for physicists , so do n't try . In any case , if PRP roll a marble close to DT bowling ball , PRP will naturally fall into DT depression  just as a passing meteorite falls to NNP . DT 's part CD . Part two is IN since DT bowling ball represents NNP , PRP is n't just sitting but spinning , which makes DT surface of DT trampoline twist a little in DT direction of DT spin . DT same goes for DT space - NN surrounding our spinning NN . What GP - B did was to measure both DT dip and DT twist . DT spacecraft managed DT impressive feat by carrying four of DT most perfect gyroscopes ever built  actually , PRP 're superconducting balls of niobium  into orbit around NN NNP while DT ship itself pointed unerringly at DT star IM Pegasi for 17 months , starting in 2004 . DT balls , meanwhile , floated independently inside , supported only by magnetic fields . If DT gyroscopes kept DT same orientation as DT spacecraft WDT bore them , Einstein MD have been refuted . But PRP wandered a bit , meaning DT satellite was flying through gently twisted space . Relativity had come through once again . PRP took NNS to figure DT out , though , because DT experiment turned out to be flawed . Patches of electric charge had built up on DT surface of DT balls , adding an extra force WDT proved extremely tricky to unravel . And even when DT physicists had done so , PRP found PRP MD measure DT dip in space - NN only to an accuracy of 1 % , and DT twist , formally known as frame dragging , to a flabby CD % . In DT half - century since GP - B was first proposed , moreover , other physicists have confirmed both effects . "" I have to compliment DT Gravity Probe B team for their result because Gravity Probe B is a very difficult and very beautiful experiment , "" DT Italian physicist Ignazio Ciufolini told DT website ScienceNOW . He was clearly being polite , considering IN his own LAGEOS satellite measured frame dragging with higher precision a few NNS ago . LAGEOS and DT other experiments WDT yielded similar findings were n't necessarily cheap , but PRP did n't cost $ 750 million either  a price WDT even NASA was finally unable to afford . PRP backed away from funding DT last stages of DT project , relying on a Saudi scientist to kick in DT final few million . So was Gravity Probe B worth PRP ? To hear GP - B NNS tell PRP , DT experiment was a resounding success . But in order to justify DT judgment in DT face of DT high cost , slow progress and imprecise results , PRP knew PRP MD n't simply invoke Einstein . Instead , PRP RB felt DT need to point out IN NNS who had worked on GP - B as grad students had gone on to do important things ( Sally Ride became DT first American woman in space ! ) , and IN DT technology developed for GP - B had widespread applications  including , believe PRP or not , GPS systems WDT now help farmers plant very straight rows of corn . For anyone familiar with DT NASA press office , this is n't a huge vote of confidence . If PRP need agriculture to justify a fundamental physics experiment , PRP 're clearly feeling a little desperate . And with sharply declining budgets , better corn rows wo n't likely persuade DT agency to spring for more big - ticket tests of general relativity . But money for such studies did n't seem to be forthcoming anyway . Just last month , NASA announced PRP was backing out of a proposed space mission called DT Laser Interferometer Space Antenna , designed to look for gravitational waves  yet another of relativity 's strange predictions . PRP MD be a while , in other words , before men of NN  and DT women who long since broke into DT once exclusive club  VB to be more or less agog again . See NNP 's Pictures of DT Week ."

In PRP , he cited three differences between 2005 and 1968 . • Todays 18 - 21 NN olds are not worried about being drafted . • DT opposition to this war WDT does exist is not part of any larger cultural NN . Now , PRP hear IN DT Army and Marine Corps are having trouble meeting their recruiting goals . PRP are witnessing an anti-war movement of a different type . I cannot remember either of DT parties to this story , but I will tell PRP anyway . Someone once VBD of a famous philosopher , IN he loved humanity , but he hated NNS . He cared deeply about humanity in DT abstract , but he was frustrated unmercifully by DT unwillingness of NNS to behave in accordance with his ideals . Oh , if PRP werent for those pesky , inconvenient NNS ! PRP Americans love to talk about war . JJ of PRP cheerlead for perpetual war . PRP stand behind our NN and our troops . PRP brand anyone who criticizes our military policies as liberal , communist , pro-terror and a lover of al - Qaeda . PRP always speak in DT first person when promoting war . (  We ought to bomb DT crap out of this country and we ought to pulverize DT country ! ) But PRP never VBP to talk about what actually happens in war . For a refresher , let me recommend DT first 20 minutes of . Talking to CD segment of America about war is IN talking to another segment of America about abortion . Heaven forbid IN PRP actually VBP fight PRP ourselves . PRP deride John Kerry , Ted Kennedy and other limousine liberals  for not parting with their wealth while PRP tax DT rest of PRP into poverty . Yet , JJ of DT most vocal war hawks in DT executive branch , in congress and in DT NN have never lifted a finger to serve CD day in DT military . DT same goes for JJ of these same war hawks at work , at church and in your neighborhood . I cannot speak for NNS half my age . However , I am VBG to put myself in DT shoes of a CD - NN - old looking at his options , with DT military being CD of them . Iraq never attacked PRP . PRP never threatened to attack PRP . If PRP had attacked PRP PRP MD have whipped them good . PRP never had DT means to do so anyway . EX were no WMDs . PRP got Saddam . PRP have had their election . And now , PRP are so busy fighting among themselves IN PRP arent about to attack anyone . Why are PRP even over RB ? If some other country comes and invades , then I will VB fight . Gladly ! But , I am not VBG to risk my life in Iraq . He speaks for DT anti-war movement of 2005 . Youll note no social commentary here . No ulterior motives . He just is not willing to be meat on DT hoof when he sees no threat to himself or his country . Who can blame him ? In 1993 , someone told Hillary NNP IN DT costs imposed by her husbands national NN care proposal MD put a lot of small business out of business . She responded IN PRP was not ( her ) job to VB out and save every undercapitalized businessman in America .  Conservative commentators rightfully compared her arrogance to DT of Marie Antoinette . When someone asked Vice NNP Cheney why he never served in DT military , he answered ,  I had other priorities .  These same commentators ought to be similarly indignant about his arrogance . EX is a black wall in Washington , DC , with 58,000 names on PRP . JJ of these NNS had other priorities  as well . War is easy to talk about and easy to be self - righteous about . However , PRP has consequences . This is nt DT hood . This is not DT South Bronx , South Central Los Angeles or Five Points here in Denver . This is WAR !!! To quote DT Talking Heads , "" This ai n't no party . This ai n't no disco . This ai n't no fooling around . "" Chuck Baldwin , another CD of my internet punditry faves , recently wrote eloquently of DT scourge of war :  To those who are engaged in war , DT consequences can be nightmarish ! Arms and legs cut off . Eyes put out . Flesh burned . Intestines ripped out . Backs broken . Skulls crushed . Lives lost . Families torn apart . Homes destroyed . NNS left without parents . Parents never able to see their NNS again . Wives without husbands . Husbands without wives . Souls snuffed into eternity . Emotional scars WDT never heal . These are DT realities of war . And this is what DT neo-cons who profit from war never have to see up close and personal .  Instead , pro-war neo-cons sit in their comfortable , air - conditioned offices and send other husbands , other wives , other parents , other NNS , other NNS to incur DT "" scourge "" of war . But DT neo-cons who trumpet war , who promote war , and who finance war never actually experience war .  This is America . PRP can have whatever opinion PRP VBP . If PRP VBP to believe DT NN is flat or worship Mungabunga , VB ahead . However , PRP does not mean your opinion has any worth . PRP can support perpetual war all PRP VBP , but if PRP yourself have never served , your opinion is of no interest to me . If PRP feel threatened by some fourth - rate , tin pot , Third NN potentate , fight him yourself . DT late Pat Tillman gave up a pro football career to become and Army Ranger . Colorado NNP Treasurer Mike Coffman , a retired Marine reservist , took a leave of absence to rejoin DT Corps in Iraq . So why dont PRP drop what PRP re doing , head to Baghdad and bust a few caps ? Yeah PRP , Rambo ! DT War of Northern Aggression ( 1861 -1865 ) was once ridiculed as a rich mans war and a poor mans fight . PRP was easy to talk about PRP , but hard to find NNS to fight PRP . Indeed , DT worst riots in American history were DT 1863 anti-draft riots in NNP York City . Before PRP whine about France not joining PRP in Iraq and before PRP say a word about DT need  for a draft , do PRP yourself ! Why is PRP  wimping out "" only when Ill say CD thing about DT draft dodgers in Vietnam : PRP had DT courage to act on their convictions . Ill say CD thing and CD thing only on behalf of John Kerry : he was in harms way for four and a half months during  Nam . I VBP a great place where DT military can find tons and tons of fresh meat to be ground pounders in whatever war is next . PRP need to put recruiters in DT evangelical churches in this country and see how JJ folks actually enlist . Each Sunday , PRP MD set up tables in DT lobby . DT pastors shouldnt have a problem with this . Come on , now ! Raise your hand ! Swear DT oath ! Sign DT paper ! Ship out and destroy some country in order to save PRP . PRP s your Christian duty ! Dude , this is a jihad for Jesus . I VBP PRP is based on DT book of Jebediah or Pauls letter to DT Estonians . If PRP are too old , or for some other reason not qualified to join DT military , form your own expeditionary force . Call PRP DT Sword of DT Lord . EX are precedents of Americans volunteering to fight in other NNS for causes PRP support . PRP is easy to talk about your Great Christian NNP and to praise his wars as doing Gods work around DT globe . PRP is easy to have a yellow ribbon and a W04 bumper sticker on your car . PRP is , as PRP say , a whole nother thing to support his policies by participating in them . If PRP wish to post this or link to this , please include DT URL as well as my e-mail address ."

"" — James 2:10 Who 's DT biggest sinner ? I am ! PRP are ! PRP all are ! PRP HAVE SINNED ! Put down your stones PRP self - righteous hypocrites ! PRP is human nature to look upon DT sins and faults of others , while often overlooking our own sins . This is hypocrisy . CD of DT worst deceptions is overlooking our own faults . DT Word of God proclaims in James 2:10 IN committing even CD SIN makes a person GUILTY in God 's eyes of breaking every command in DT Bible . James 2:10 , “ For whosoever shall keep DT whole law , and yet offend in CD point , he is guilty of all . ” This is a startling doctrine WDT is hardly touched upon in churches today . If PRP are a Christian DT whole NN is waiting for PRP to fall . Sermon uploads WDT MD VB lives are fortunate to receive even a hundred hits , but PRP upload some juicy gossip about a preacher sinning and millions of NNS VBP to VB PRP . This evidences DT hypocrisy and desperate wickedness of DT human heart , just as Jeremiah 17:9 says , “ DT heart is deceitful above all things , and desperately wicked : who can VB PRP ? ” If PRP are truly right with God , then PRP see yourself as DT biggest sinner , because PRP VBP yourself better than anyone . Do PRP VB what a hypocrite is Biblically ? PRP is a person who thinks IN someone else is a bigger sinner than them self . Here is a precious MP3 sermon by Pastor Jack Hyles titled , “ Chief Of Sinners . ” No real Christian claims to be less a sinner than others ! EX is no teaching in DT Bible WDT says Christians are less sinful than unsaved NNS . DT only difference is IN PRP as believers have DT Holy Spirit indwelling our bodies . As separated Christians , PRP must never accept DT sin with DT sinner , nor should PRP ever reject DT sinner with DT sin . PRP ought to love everybody with God 's unconditional love through DT Gospel of DT Lord Jesus Christ . Did PRP VB IN DT divorce rate amongst professed Christians is equal to DT of DT heathen unsaved NN ? This is because Christians VBP DT same way as DT heathen NN . Romans 12:2 exhorts Christians not to be conformed , DT is , fashioned , according to this present NN . Divorce is always worldly , never Christian . In filing for divorce , a person is saying : “ My spouse is a bigger sinner than I am ; therefore , I have a right to abandon , quit and break my marriage vows . ” No PRP do n't ! Divorce is a horrible sin rooted in PRP 's own hypocritical self - righteousness . DT Bible teaches IN PRP are all as guilty as DT vilest sinner in God 's eyes . This doctrine is virtually unheard of nowadays , because few preachers stress DT Law of God anymore , which condemns all of PRP as guilty sinners before God ... Now PRP VBP IN what things soever DT law saith , PRP saith to them who are under DT law : IN every mouth MD be stopped , and all DT NN MD become guilty before God ” ( Romans 3:19 ) . In DT eyes of men , murdering someone is obviously worse than stealing their lunch ; but as far as God is concerned PRP are all equally lacking any righteousness of our own . PRP are each as dirty and rotten as DT other guy . Oftentimes what NNS perceive as acceptable , such as homosexuality , is an abomination unto God . If PRP SEARCH DT SCRIPTURES as Jesus commanded in John 5:39 , then PRP can only come to DT conclusion IN PRP are as sinful as DT worst sinner in God 's eyes and PRP matters not who is more guilty . PRP are all guilty ( Romans 3:10,23 ) . DT fact of DT matter is IN PRP are all sinners deserving of punishment in Hell ( Romans 6:23 ; Revelation 20:11 - 15 ) . Although PRP MD never commit murder or rob a bank , DT does make PRP any less guilty of being a horrible sinner in DT eyes of God . “ If PRP MD ever hate DT sin in ourselves as much as PRP hate DT sin in others , PRP might have some idea what His Book is all about . ” — Pastor Jack Hyles ( a quote from page 322 of DT awesome biography of Dr. Hyles titled , “ DT Fundamental Man ” ) MD I say , no matter how righteous I MD try to live , DT ONLY reason why I will ever be righteous is because of DT imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ . Jesus paid my sin debt , and He alone is my righteousness . I have no righteousness to offer God , and neither do PRP . NNS tend to selfishly judge themselves based upon what sins PRP personally DON'T commit . Did PRP understand DT ? NNS who do n't commit adultery are quick to condemn others who commit adultery , because DT 's not their sin . But perhaps PRP are a thief for a living , and so PRP are silent when PRP comes to DT sin of theft . This is how shallow , wicked and hypocritical most NNS are . DT Bible perfectly illustrates this in Jesus ' account of DT Pharisee and DT publican who went up to DT temple to pray ... “ Two men went up into DT temple to pray ; DT CD a Pharisee , and DT other a publican . DT Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , IN I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican . I fast twice in DT week , I give tithes of all WDT I possess . And DT publican , standing afar off , MD not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , God be merciful to me a sinner . I tell PRP , this man went down to his house justified rather than DT other : for every NN WDT exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he IN humbleth himself shall be exalted ” ( Luke 18:10 - 14 ) . DT Pharisee in Luke 18:10 - 14 made DT grave mistake of comparing himself with other NNS , instead of measuring himself up against DT holy Law of God . If PRP foolishly look at other NNS who commit DT sins WDT PRP do n't , or sins IN PRP perceive as being worse than our sins , then PRP naturally become self - righteousness and VBP PRP are “ better ” than others . I tell PRP , PRP are as filthy and rotten as Adolf Hitler in God 's eyes , and so am I ... “ But PRP are all as an unclean thing , and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags ; and PRP all do fade as a leaf ; and our iniquities , IN DT wind , have taken PRP away ” ( Isaiah 64:6 ) . Reproach For Sins Comes Now Or Later DT Bible teaches IN some NNS 's sins are open ( known ) beforehand here on NN . But DT Bible teaches IN everyone else 's sins will follow them and be revealed in eternity , causing shame and reproach ... 5:24 , “ Some men 's sins are open beforehand , VBG before to judgment ; and some men PRP follow after . ” When DT truth is known , ALL NNS will be exposed as wicked and shameful sinners . When asked to give DT name of DT worst and most horrible sinners PRP VBP , most NNS tend to VB of NNS besides them self . This is DT hypocritical nature of humanity . This is why all gossip is sinful and wrong , DT is , because PRP are just as sinful as DT person WDT PRP criticize . Hey , let 's talk about our selves instead . All of a sudden no NN has anything to say ? Perhaps PRP have never commit a particular sin per se , but PRP ought not to judge others simply because PRP sin differently than PRP do . Mankind is inherently sinful and has NO self - righteousness to offer God . Even committing CD sin is enough to be damned to DT Lake of Fire forever ( Revelation 20:11 - 15 ) . DT 's DT reason why God sent His only begotten Son , Jesus Christ , to die on DT cross of Calvary , shedding His precious blood to pay for our sins . God 's Law indicts all humanity as guilty sinners ( Romans 3:19 ) . 1st Timothy 5:24 says IN some men's sins are open to criticism and judgment beforehand , but everyone else 's sins will be made known eventually on judgment day . NO CD is VBG to retain their dignity and honor on judgment day as a self - righteous person who did n't do anything shameful , disgraceful or surprising . DT Bible declares IN ALL men have come short of DT glory of God ( Romans 3:23 ) . DT Bible teaches IN DT Pharisees who condemned others were DT guiltiest of all sinners ( Matthew 7:1 - 5 ) . DT reason why hypocrites throw rocks at others is because PRP are proud , arrogant and saturated with sins them self . Those hypocrites who condemn others for their sins will CD day be silenced completely in eternity when THEIR SINS are revealed . Christians who realize their own sinfulness DON'T condemn other NNS when PRP sin . Slanderers and critics of sinners are self - righteous , FAILING to see their own depth of sin and evil . Most NNS have absolutely no idea how sinful PRP really are in comparison to DT holy Bible . PRP and I are dirty , rotten , guilty , sinners in God 's eyes . Therefore , PRP had all better VB twice before PRP decide to throw rocks at other NNS who sin , denouncing them as evil , and taking delight in their calamity . Our day of reckoning is RB coming ! So before PRP look down in disdain upon someone else who has sinned horribly , PRP had better consider your own horrible sins in God 's eyes , because DT Lord will judge PRP according to how PRP judge others ... Matthew 7:1 - 3 , “ Judge not , IN ye be not judged . For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , PRP shall be measured to PRP again . And why beholdest thou DT mote WDT is in thy brother 's eye , but considerest not DT beam WDT is in thine own eye ? ” Even DT best Christians still have a mote ( tiny piece ) in their eye , meaning IN PRP are all sinners ; but those evil critics who spread gossip , tell tales , condemn others , reveal secrets and hypocritically destroy their neighbor with their mouth have a beam ( large piece ) in their eye . God 's harshest judgment is reserved for those arrogant sinners who condemn other sinners , overlooking their own wickedness in hypocrisy while trying to destroy DT good name of others . If DT truth be known , PRP all have a skeleton closet of sins . DT Bible says IN a person is calling God a liar if PRP deny their sinfulness ( 1st John 1:8,10 ) . PRP are living in an evil generation WDT tolerates all manner of sin and wickedness from Hollywood , rock music stars , and their favorite immoral professional athletes ; yet , DT NN is waiting for every Christian to fall flat . Jesus taught in John 15:19 not to marvel if DT NN hates PRP as Christians , because DT NN hated Him first . 2nd Timothy 3:12 foretold IN those faithful Christians who live godly in Christ Jesus SHALL SUFFER PERSECUTION . DT NN hates DT Bible and Christians who uphold DT truths of DT Bible . MD to God WDT Christians in churches today MD stop saying , “ he has sinned , ” and “ she has sinned , ” and DT we'd all start saying , “ PRP have sinned . ” PRP is sinful pride WDT causes a wife to publicly criticize or divorce her husband . PRP is sinful pride WDT causes DT manure - spreading newsmedia to mercilessly destroy NNS 's lives . PRP is sinful pride WDT causes NNS to broadcast their parent 's dirty laundry to others . PRP is sinful pride WDT causes self - righteous hypocrites to meddle in other NNS 's marriages . I came to DT realization CD day as a believer IN I am as rotten and sinful as DT worst sinner . I am just as sinful as any adulterer , mass - murderer , homosexual , thief , liar or Satan worshipper . AND SO ARE PRP ! Our sins are just as woeful and wrong . PRP have no room to condemn . This is a faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation , IN Christ Jesus came into DT NN to save sinners ; of whom I am chief ” ( 1st Timothy 1:15 ) . DT Apostle Paul was a faithful missionary who loved DT Lord Jesus Christ and helped NNS everywhere he went . Paul suffered horribly from shipwreck , hunger , turmoil and malicious beatings from his enemies ; yet he kept VBG for God . Paul was a mighty preacher and a strong Christian . Although Paul was arguably DT greatest missionary who ever lived , he still addressed himself as DT “ chief of sinners . ” I do n't VB too JJ believers today who are anywhere near as dedicated and committed to Jesus Christ as was Paul . If a good Christian IN Paul esteemed himself as DT “ chief of sinners , ” then PRP ought to feel DT same way . PRP must distinguish between condemning someone for their sins versus publicly exposing them because PRP are a threat to society . I publicly expose abortionists ( murderers ) , homosexuals ( sex perverts ) and religious deceivers ( liars ) through my online ministry ; but I do not condemn any of them personally . I am not condemning them ; God 's Word condemns all of PRP ( Romans 3:19 - 23 ) . I am as rotten and sinful as DT worst sinner . I am not self - righteous ; I am trusting upon HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS , i.e. , DT righteousness of Jesus Christ ( 2nd Corinthians 5:21 ) . I deserve to burn in Hell and EX 's absolutely nothing good about me except DT Lord Jesus Christ Who lives in my heart , thankfully . If a local school has a teacher who is teaching teens how to have homosexual “ fist sex , ” which is happening today in Massachusetts , then DT evil person needs to be exposed . Godless heathens are quick to cry out , “ Jesus VBD , ' judge not lest ye be not judged . ' ” PRP conveniently fail to quote John 7:24 where Jesus stated , “ Judge not according to DT appearance , but judge righteous judgment . ” So PRP are supposed to judge , but rightfully so . Ephesians 5:10 - 11 reads , “ Proving what is acceptable unto DT Lord . And have no fellowship with DT unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them . ” DT word “ proving ” in Ephesians 5:10 is DT Greek word ( dokimazo ) and means “ to test . ” Thus , God wants PRP to test everything , to judge righteously , to discern whether or not something is acceptable to Him , i.e. , in agreement with His holy Word . Certainly , PRP is NOT acceptable to teach NNS WDT it's ok for Timmy to stick his fist in Johnny 's backside as an expression of love . PRP are living in a sicko society in America . Ephesians 5:11 commands God-fearing believers to reprove [ Greek : elencho , i.e. , “ to expose ” ] all works of darkness .

For example , during a closing operation , two phases of a circuit - breaker MD close and latch successfully but not DT third phase , or , during an opening operation , two phases MD properly open but DT third remains stuck in DT closed position . Except on mainly underground systems , DT vast majority of short - circuit faults are weather - related , followed by equipment failure . DT weather factors WDT usually cause short - circuit faults are : lightning strikes , accumulation of snow or NN , heavy rain , strong winds or gales , salt pollution depositing on insulators on overhead lines and in substations , floods and fires adjacent to electrical equipment , for example , beneath overhead lines . Vandalism MD RB be a cause of short - circuit faults as well as contact with or breach of minimum clearances between overhead lines and trees due to current overload . Lightning strikes discharge steep - fronted impulse currents with peak values in DT range of a few kiloamps up to 100 or 200 kA for a duration of several microseconds . If DT strike hits an overhead line or its NN wire , DT voltage produced across DT insulator MD be so large IN a back - flashover and short circuit occurs . This MD involve CD or all three phases of a three - phase electrical circuit and as a result a transient power frequency short - circuit current flows . For example , consider a 132 - kV three - phase overhead transmission line of steel tower construction and CD NN wire . DT surge impedances of DT tower , line phase conductors and NN wire are given as 220 , 350 and 400 Ω , respectively , and DT tower ’s earthing or footing resistance is 50 Ω . DT line ’s rated lightning impulse withstand voltage to NN is 650 kV peak phase to NN ( nominal peak phase to NN voltage is ) . A lightning strike with a modest peak current of 10 kA hits a tower on DT line and , to a reasonable approximation , ‘ sees ’ half DT surge impedance of DT NN wire in parallel with DT surge impedance of DT tower . DT voltage produced across DT line ’s insulator is approximately equal to 10 kA×105 Ω=1050 kV . This significantly exceeds DT line ’s insulation strength , causes back - flashover on all three phases of DT line and a three - phase to NN short - circuit fault . If DT shielding of DT NN wire fails and DT lightning strike hits CD of DT phase conductors near a tower , then DT voltage produced across DT line ’s insulator is approximately equal to 10 kA ×175 Ω=1750 kV . In this case , a smaller lightning current in DT order of 3.8 kA MD be sufficient to cause a back - flashover and hence a short - circuit fault . On lower - voltage distribution lines , even ‘ indirect ’ lightning strikes , DT is , those WDT hit nearby objects to DT line MD produce a sufficiently large voltage on DT line to cause an insulator flashover and a short - circuit fault . Other causes of short - circuit faults are fires . DT smoke of fires beneath overhead lines consists of small particles which encourage DT breakdown of DT air WDT is subjected to DT intense electric field of a high - voltage power line . DT hot air in DT flames of a fire has a much lower insulation strength than air at ambient temperature . A flashover across an insulator to NN or from a phase conductor to a tree MD occur . Equipment failure of machines , transformers , reactors , cables , etc. , causes JJ short - circuit faults . These MD be caused by failure of internal insulation due to ageing and degradation , breakdown due to high switching or lightning over - voltages , by mechanical incidents or by inappropriate installation . An example is a breakdown of a cable ’s polymer insulation due to ageing or DT creation of voids within DT insulation caused by an external mechanical force being accidentally applied on DT cable . Short - circuit faults MD RB be caused by human error . A classical example is CD where maintenance staff inadvertently leave isolated equipment connected through safety NN clamps when maintenance work is completed . A three - phase to NN short - circuit fault occurs when DT equipment is re-energised to return PRP to service . On mainly overhead line systems , DT majority of short - circuit faults , typically 80 % –90 % , tend to occur on overhead lines and DT rest on cables , substation equipment and busbars combined . Typically , on a high - voltage transmission system with overhead line steel tower construction , such as DT England and Wales transmission system , long - term average short - circuit fault statistics show IN around 300 short - circuit faults occur per annum . Of these , 67 % are CD - phase to NN , 25 % are phase to phase , 5 % are three - phase to NN and three - phase clear of NN , and 3 % are two - phase to NN . About 77 % of CD - phase to NN faults are caused by lightning strikes followed by wind and gales then salt pollution on insulators . Although lightning can cause some phase - to - phase faults , by far DT most common causes of these faults are snow / NN followed by wind / gales WDT cause two line conductors to clash . DT majority of three - phase to NN and two - phase to NN faults in England and Wales are caused by lightning then wind and gales . On wood - pole overhead lines , for example , some 132 kV and lower voltages in England and Wales , between 50 % and 67 % of short - circuit faults are two - phase and three - phase faults ."

This is only partly true . DT moon does pull on ocean NN , but DT tug at any CD point is about 10 million times weaker than NNP 's gravity . PRP 's really DT interplay of gravity between DT moon , NNP , and sun WDT creates a tidal force , and PRP 's more of a "" push "" than a "" pull . "" Each molecule of NN is pulled by DT moon 's gravity , but alone IN acceleration is so weak PRP is n't noticeable . Because ocean NN covers about 71 % of NNP 's surface and is connected as CD liquid body , however , all of those tiny tugs add up to form a significant pressure — DT tidal force . Molecules of NN near DT poles are pulled mostly straight down , those on DT face of NNP closest to DT moon experience DT strongest pull toward DT moon , and those on DT opposite side of NNP feel DT weakest acceleration . Together , these interactions form a pressure on seawater WDT generally directs PRP away from DT poles and toward DT equator , where PRP 's strong enough to fight gravity to form two bulges : DT high tides . Tides follow DT moon as PRP orbits NNP every 28 days , but PRP 's not as simple as DT . NN sloshes around , just as PRP does within in aquarium , and DT shape of DT seafloor , DT position of DT coasts , and DT Coriolis effect ( caused by NNP 's rotation ) affect where and to what extent tides occur — resulting in a complex pattern of "" tidal nodes . "" "" NNP rotates so quickly IN DT tide NN wave can't move around DT NNP quickly enough , "" Ted Swift , an environmental scientist who works for DT NN of California , told Business Insider in an email . "" What PRP see as tides on DT coast are resonances — rotating standing waves — set up by DT fundamental tidal potential ' signal . ' "" Smaller bodies of NN , IN lakes and pools , do n't have noticeable tides because PRP lack enough liquid to create a pressure WDT can visibly overcome DT pull of NNP 's gravity . DT sun 's gravity RB affects DT tides , accounting for roughly CD - third of DT phenomenon . When DT sun 's gravity counteracts DT moon 's , PRP leads to lower - than - average "" neap tides .

Because signals cannot travel in a straight line between DT NN and DT moon 's far side , NNP launched DT Queqiao ( "" Magpie Bridge "" ) relay satellite into DT moon 's orbit in NNP .

DT film ’s scientific consultant Kip Thorne has since received DT Nobel Prize in physics , for his role in detecting DT gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes . He knows his topic . If PRP do not experience similar NN distortions in our daily life , PRP is only because here on NNP PRP are too small for PRP to notice . PRP is not DT first NN NN has shown our intuitions to be mistaken . NN is constantly learning something JJ , and more often than not such learning means jettisoning wrong ideas . DT is why NN often clashes with common sense — our intuition wants NNP to be flat and still , and NN to be DT same everywhere . None of this is true . NN is a mystery WDT has always troubled PRP , stirring deep emotions . Perhaps PRP is because , as Buddha put PRP , our difficulty in dealing with impermanence ( or DT passage of NN ) is at DT root of our suffering . Hans Reichenbach , in CD of DT most lucid books on DT matter , DT Direction of NNP , suggested IN PRP might have been in order to escape from this anxiety IN DT Greek philosopher Parmenides denied NN ’s existence , Plato imagined a NN of ideas outside PRP and Hegel spoke of DT moment in which DT spirit transcends temporality . PRP MD be because of this IN PRP have imagined DT existence of “ eternity ” , a NN outside NN WDT PRP imagine inhabited by gods , a God or immortal souls . Our deeply emotional attitude towards DT subject MD have contributed more to DT construction of cathedrals of philosophy than logic or reason did . DT opposite emotional attitude — DT veneration of NN by thinkers such as Heraclitus or Henri Bergson — has given rise to just as JJ philosophies but still not brought PRP much nearer to understanding its reality . Physics helps PRP to penetrate some layers of DT mystery . But our grasp of DT NN is shaped by DT vast dialogue WDT involves DT whole of our culture , from physics to philosophy , literature to DT neuro - sciences . All these crafts MD be needed here . Physics has conclusively shown IN DT temporal structure of DT NN is different from our perception of PRP . PRP has given PRP DT hope of being able to VB DT nature of NN free from our emotional fog . But in advancing towards quantum theories of gravity with a temporal structure far removed from our intuition , PRP end up losing our own sense of NN . Just as Copernicus , by studying DT revolutions of DT heavens , ended up understanding IN PRP is PRP rather than DT sky WDT turns , exploring DT nature of NN leads PRP to discover something about ourselves . Perhaps , ultimately , DT emotional dimension of NN is not DT film of mist WDT prevents PRP from apprehending its nature objectively . Perhaps DT emotion of NN is precisely what NN is for PRP . DT uniform nature of NN is scarcely DT only feature where our intuition has turned out to be mistaken . To everybody ’s surprise , DT difference between past and future fails to show up in DT elementary equations WDT govern DT physical NN . But DT discovery WDT has been DT most disconcerting of all has been finding out IN DT notion of “ present ” does not make sense in DT larger universe ; PRP only makes sense in DT vicinity of PRP slow human critters . “ Here - and - now ” is a well - defined notion in NN , but “ now ” on its own is not . Philosophers are struggling greatly with this discovery : if PRP call reality WDT which exists now , what is reality after PRP have realised IN EX is n’t a well - defined “ now ” all over DT universe ? DT very grammar PRP use to talk about things , in which verbs have only a past , future and present tense , is inadequate to describe DT ways of nature . In physics , a great debate on DT nature of physical NN has developed in an arc spanning from Aristotle to Newton and from Newton to Einstein . Our understanding has repeatedly deepened in DT course of this process . For Aristotle , NN is just a way to count what happens , but PRP becomes an autonomous flowing variable for Newton and is then reinterpreted by Einstein as a feature of DT gravitational field . Einstein ’s great theory , general relativity , keeps receiving spectacular empirical support — confirming such counter - intuitive predictions as black holes , expansion of DT universe , NN dilation , gravitational waves and more . These give strong credibility to Einstein ’s picture and continue to rule out alternative conjectures . But EX is certainly more to learn . PRP do not yet VB DT fate of matter falling into DT black holes PRP see in DT sky , where Einstein ’s theory says IN NN comes to an end . And DT full complexity of what PRP perceive as DT flow of NN is not accounted for by general relativity alone : PRP involves quantum theory , thermodynamics and probably more , including neuroscience and DT cognitive sciences . My own work in NN has been concentrated on DT effort to understand how DT quantum nature of DT NN affects space and NN . EX is not yet agreement on a solution ; but EX is a rather large consensus around DT expectation IN DT concept of physical NN is likely to move even further away from our intuition , when its quantum properties are taken into account . This is why reflecting on DT nature of NN is a constant concern for myself and JJ of my colleagues . Tentative theories of quantum spacetime have little WDT resembles NN as PRP experience PRP . DT basic equations of DT theory on which I work , loop quantum gravity , have no special “ NN ” variable at all . PRP describe processes in which things VBP but no single NN variable can track all possible changes . Does all this suggest our perception of NN is illusory ? PRP does not . But PRP indicates IN what PRP perceive as NN MD not be a simple and elementary aspect of nature , but rather a complex phenomenon with JJ layers , each needing to be addressed by a different chapter of NN . This is DT true question about DT nature of NN : which aspects of our sense of PRP pertain to which domain of NN ? Key aspects of NN are described by DT NN of heat , thermodynamics . Any NN DT future is definitely distinguishable from DT past , EX is something IN heat involved . Thermodynamics traces DT direction of NN to something called DT “ low entropy of DT past ” , a still mysterious phenomenon on which discussions rage . I have studied DT hypothesis IN some aspects of DT solution might come from recognising a perspectival aspect for NN . VB of DT magnificent spectacle of DT daily rotation of DT sky : PRP see DT sun , moon and stars , DT entire cosmos , majestically rotating . PRP has taken millennia for PRP to understand why . To figure this out , PRP had to consider ourselves . PRP is not DT vast cosmos WDT is rotating , PRP is PRP who live on a spinning rock . This is a perspectival explanation . Something similarly perspectival , I VBP , underpins our peculiar perception of DT flow of NN . Entropy growth orients NN and permits DT existence of traces of DT past , and these permit DT possibility of memories , which hold together our sense of identity . I suspect IN what PRP call DT “ flowing ” of NN has to be understood by studying DT structure of our brain rather than by studying physics : evolution has shaped our brain into a machine WDT feeds off memory in order to anticipate DT future . This is what PRP are listening to when PRP listen to DT passing of NN . Understanding DT “ flowing ” of NN is therefore something WDT MD pertain to neuroscience more than to fundamental physics . Searching for DT explanation of DT feeling of flow in physics might be a mistake . Our understanding depends on DT neural structures shaped by DT peculiar environment in which PRP live . PRP capture a very imprecise version of DT actual temporal structure of reality . Our experience is an approximation of an approximation of a description of DT NN from our particular perspective as beings dependent on DT growth of entropy , anchored to DT thermodynamical arrow of NN . For PRP , EX is , as Ecclesiastes has PRP , a NN to be born and a NN to die . DT NN PRP experience is a multilayered , complex concept with distinct properties rooted in distinct layers of reality . JJ parts of DT full story are still far from being clear . NN remains , to a large extent , a mystery , perhaps DT greatest NN . A mystery WDT relates to issues ranging from DT fate of black holes to DT enigma of our individual identity and consciousness . Will PRP be able to understand things better in DT future ? I VBP so . Our understanding of nature has increased vertiginously over DT course of DT centuries , and PRP are continuing to learn . PRP are glimpsing something about DT mystery of NN . PRP can see DT NN described by quantum theories of gravity : PRP can perceive with DT mind ’s eye DT profound structure of DT NN where NN as PRP VBP PRP no longer exists — just as Paul McCartney ’s “ Fool on DT Hill ” sees DT NN spinning round when he sees DT sun VBG down . I RB VBP PRP are beginning to see IN PRP are NN . PRP are this clearing opened by DT traces of memory inside DT connections between our neurons . PRP are memory . PRP are nostalgia . PRP are longing for a future WDT will not come . Horace , DT greatest poet of Roman antiquity and perhaps DT greatest cantor of NN , calls PRP our “ brief circle ” ( “ PRP must be wise . Pour DT wine / and enclose in this brief circle / your long - cherished hope ” ) . This clearing , opened up for PRP by memory and anticipation , is our NN : a source of anguish on occasion , but in DT end DT marvellous gift of our existence .

Critics seized on DeVos from DT start . While her mother was a JJ school teacher , she never taught or worked in school administration herself .

DeVos ' believes her own remarks have "" not at all "" hurt her ability to transform DT education system , spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill VBD , providing a list of accomplishments so far . Those include rolling back education regulations proposed by DT Obama administration , reforms to DT student loan program , and a pro-school choice budget proposal for DT federal NN . Here 's a look at her most controversial moments so far : DeVos landed back in DT headlines this week after teachers and Connecticut 's Democratic governor rallied against her outside East Hartford High School , protesting her characterization of DT school in a recent appearance before Congress . She quoted a former student named Michael , who she VBD was shunted from grade - to - grade with barely passing marks while being bullied . "" This constant fear made him hate school . He described DT school he was assigned to as and I quote ' nothing more than adult daycare , a dangerous daycare , ' "" DeVos VBD . Teachers sent a "" message IN PRP did n't VB Michael MD amount to much "" and EX are "" countless other students IN him . "" Gov. Dannel Malloy VBD DT student 's story "" undoubtedly had some validity for DT individual "" but was an unfair characterization of DT school and education system . "" To have those words WDT were repeated about this institution this community without any fact checking without any background does n't speak well , "" VBD Malloy . Once in office , DeVos visited a middle school in Washington , and later described DT teachers she met as being in "" receive mode "" and are "" waiting to be told what PRP have to do , "" rather than "" empowered to facilitate great teaching . "" DT school , Jefferson Academy , blasted DeVos in return , saying she 's right only if "" PRP mean PRP ' receive ' students at a 2nd grade level and move them to an 8th grade level . "" Her confirmation hearing answer to a gun-related question was made all DT more memorable because of how she answered PRP . DeVos has long advocated for voucher systems WDT give parents funds towards enrolling students at private schools . DT position is already controversial , with critics saying a voucher system MD undercut JJ schools . "" What if PRP VBD PRP are not accepting African - American students , but DT was OK with DT NN , "" Rep. Katherine Clark , D - Massachusetts pressed her . "" Do PRP see any situation where PRP MD step in ? "" DeVos replied IN DT "" Office of Civil Rights and our Title IX ( anti- discrimination ) protections are broadly applicable across DT board . "" "" I am shocked IN PRP cannot come up with CD example of discrimination WDT PRP MD stand up for students , "" responded Clark . Colleges founded because of segregation were ' pioneers ' of school choice DeVos was accused of glossing over history after a meeting with officials from historically black colleges and universities . Critics pointed out IN Jim Crow laws and racist policies barred African - Americans from enrolling , prompting DT creation of HBCUs . DeVos appeared to respond by later saying HBCUs were "" born not out of mere choice , but out of necessity , in DT face of racism , and in DT aftermath of DT Civil War . "" In a recent speech , DeVos took blasted critics of her school choice vision . "" PRP will be hurting DT NNS and families who can least afford PRP . If politicians in a NN block education choice , PRP means those politicians do not support equal opportunity for all kids , "" she VBD ."

"" DT opinions expressed in this commentary are their own . View more opinion articles on CNN . ( CNN ) This is DT third in a series of three op - eds tracing DT long path of Vice NNP Mike Pence 's ambition , from college , where he found a form of evangelicalism WDT weds theology to Republican politics , to DT national stage -- and a job WDT puts him a short step away from DT presidency . Part CD : Mike Pence 's plan to outlast NNP Part two : Mike Pence went to college and found God Mike Pence won his first political campaign in 2000 using what became his basic strategy of guns , God , and money . He raised lots of cash by appealing to big - NN conservative donors -- among them , Betsy DeVos , Charles and David Koch , and Erik Prince -- with hawkish positions on taxes and regulation . He found his voters at churches and gun clubs . He spiced his recipe with attacks on NN WDT placed him to DT right of JJ of his fellow Republicans . IN a handful of Republicans , Pence made an issue of DT pending agreement to settle NN lawsuits against tobacco companies for lying for decades about DT dangers of their addictive products . Pence did n't just oppose DT deal . He insisted PRP was based on a lie and DT result of a pernicious NN plot . "" Despite DT hysteria from DT political class and DT NN , "" Pence wrote in 2000 , "" smoking does n't kill . In fact , 2 out of every three smokers does not die from a smoking related illness and 9 out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer . "" Pence 's first bit of data was simply wrong . Two - thirds of smokers actually do die of smoking - related illnesses . His second was misleading . Lung cancer is a relatively rare illness , but PRP is still vastly more common among smokers . In fact , PRP is CD of DT few cancers for which NN has established a very well - known cause , and Pence 's column was published after industry leaders had acknowledged DT NN risks of their product . Why MD a candidate for Congress speak so falsely and recklessly ? Pence 's motivation MD have been connected to his family 's ownership stake in a chain of convenience stores called Tobacco Road , which sold cigarettes alongside soft drinks and chips . But he was RB eager to establish some libertarian street cred . "" A NN big enough to VB after smokers is big enough to VB after PRP , "" he wrote . If Pence 's vocabulary was a bit 19th - century , so was his thinking . After calling Charles Darwin "" a sincere biologist , "" Pence attacked DT NN of evolution , which , in his telling , was conjecture and thus no worthier of respect than other notions about DT origins of life . Darwin "" hoped IN some day PRP MD be proven by DT fossil record but did not live to see DT , "" declared Pence , "" nor have PRP . "" Of course , EX is nothing uncertain in DT prevailing NN on DT origins of life on NNP . As DT National Academy of NNP explains , a scientific theory is not merely conjecture . PRP is "" a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature WDT is supported by a vast body of evidence . "" This is why physicists still talk about a "" theory "" of gravity WDT explains why objects fall down and not up and biologists speak of "" cell theory , "" even though DT fact IN living things are composed of cells is established truth . A willful denial of DT facts was required for Pence to press his case against Darwin , but he was clearly devoted to this cause . Having cast doubt on DT NN of evolution , he VBD IN he was only asking for everyone to be open - minded . "" I MD simply and humbly ask ... can PRP RB consider teaching other theories of DT origin of species ? "" Then , he declared IN his own mind was shut . "" DT Bible tells PRP IN God created man in his own imagine , male and female , "" VBD Pence . "" He created them . And I believe DT . "" Pence 's speech on evolution , preserved on C - SPAN , was delivered in DT cadence of a radio preacher . Pence had developed this way of speaking during his NNS as a broadcaster , when he pitched himself as "" Rush Limbaugh on decaf . "" But as friendly as he sounded , Pence was determined to impose his religious views through JJ policy and to do PRP through DT manipulation of language . Another example was his proposal to use federal funds to turn gay NNS straight . So - called "" conversion therapy , "" promoted by quacks and religious bigots , assumes IN homosexuality is a medically treatable pathology , which PRP is not . Pence 's proposal never gained traction in Congress , but PRP was a loud dog whistle to those on DT homophobic Christian right . With his sights set on DT White House , Pence sought executive experience back home in Indiana , where a GOP advantage in registration helped him win a narrow victory in DT 2012 governor 's race . He installed his wife , Karen , in an office at DT NN house , a first for first ladies of DT NN , and had a pair of red phones wired to connect his desk directly with hers . Pence was unremarkable as governor , save for his commitment to DT causes of Christian conservatives in pushing a NN law WDT permitted discrimination against gay customers by businesses . When Indiana 's Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 2015 was approved , Pence signed PRP into law in a rare , private ceremony where he was flanked by clergy from a variety of religions . Reaction to RFRA and DT photo was intense . Pence backed down , seeking amendments WDT watered down DT law . But while DT episode seemed to threaten his future , he was rescued by Donald NNP 's offer to join his ticket as DT GOP 's 2016 candidate for vice NN . Six months into DT JJ administration , Republicans were already talking about how Pence seemed to be running a shadow campaign to become DT GOP nominee for NN in DT event IN NNP was felled by either DT Russia scandal or some other force . Pence 's chief of staff is a sharp - elbowed political player named Nick Ayers , and his connections to big donors are strong . Organized and methodical where DT NNP is chaotic and impulsive , Pence is ready to achieve DT dream he believes God wants him to fulfill . Should Pence achieve his goal , he MD likely remake DT GOP , now almost a cult devoted to Donald NNP , as a Christian right political party where NNS of other faiths MD struggle to find a home . Instead of policy driven by personality , a Pence administration MD likely pursue policy guided by a particular reading of DT Bible . And DT divisions WDT now seem to be separating Americans MD become broader , deeper , and even more difficult to bridge ."

DT incident provoked responses from high profile NNS IN Neil deGrasse Tyson , who noted such statements made by a JJ figure are responsible for a strain of anti-intellectualism plaguing DT nation . Unfortunately , few NNS seized DT opportunity to explain why PRP VBP DT NNP is in fact a globe . DT following , therefore , highlights some of DT foremost reasons why PRP VBP DT NNP is round . DT moon is not made of cheese and DT NN is not flat . This can be observed during a lunar eclipse , which occurs whenever DT NNP ’s orbit places PRP in - between DT sun and moon . DT NNP casts a round shadow on DT moon . Since DT NNP is rotating and consistently casting a round shadow on DT moon during every eclipse , its proves beyond a shadow ( forgive DT pun ) of a doubt WDT DT NNP is in fact round . Anyone who has ever waited for a ship to dock will notice IN a ship does not sporadically appear off DT horizon but gradually emerges from beneath DT ocean . DT reason ships do not emerge from DT ocean – nor fall off DT edge of NNP – is because DT NN is round . DT fact IN ships appear to emerge from DT depths of DT NN is an illusion cast by NNP ’s curvature . If PRP place a stick upright , PRP will cast a shadow . DT length of DT shadow changes throughout DT day . If DT NN was flat , then two sticks at different places should produce DT same shadows . DT problem is PRP do n’t , which only makes sense if DT NNP is round . In fact , Eratosthenes took note of this phenomena to calculate DT circumference of DT NNP nearly 2,200 NNS ago . DT curvature of DT NNP If DT NNP were flat , then PRP all MD stand on an equal playing field . DT problem , as anyone who has ever stood atop of a hill knows , is IN DT higher elevated PRP are , DT more PRP can see . At certain heights , PRP can actually see DT curvature of DT NNP . This makes complete sense if DT NNP is round and absolutely no sense if DT NNP is flat . Different NN zones exist because DT NN is an orbiting globe . When DT sun shines on a spot of land , DT other side is darkened ( and vise versa ) . This creates NN differences . If NNP was flat , DT sun MD shine on everyone at DT same NN . Flat NNP theory is based upon an outdated understanding of gravity . Conventional understandings of gravity are incompatible with Flat NNP theory , because PRP require a spherical mass pulling all objects towards its center . Flat - Earthers propos IN a disk - shaped NNP is accelerating “ upward , ” which gives DT illusion of gravity . Of course , no explanation is given why or how DT NNP is accelerating upwards . As DT noted list has shown , not only are Flat - Earthers misinformed – PRP ’re square . Anyone who doubts DT existence of gravity is invited to jump out of a three story building ."

CD of PRP asked , "" PRP sounds IN PRP VBP something PRP do n't VB . "" "" Yes , PRP is true . This is not some idle talk . He is already born and he is educated and being groomed to be NN right now . PRP will be impressed to VB IN he has gone to DT best schools of Presidents . He is what PRP call "" Ivy League "" . PRP do n't believe me , but he is real and I even VBP his name . His name is Barack . His mother is white and American and his father is black from Africa . DT 's right , a chocolate baby ! And he 's VBG to be your NNP . "" She became more and more smug as she presented her stream of detailed knowledge and predictions so matter - of - factly - as though all were foregone conclusions . "" PRP 's all been thought out . His father is not an American black so he wo n't have DT social slave stigma . He is intelligent and he is half white and has been raised from DT cradle to be an atheist and a Communist . He 's gone to DT finest schools . He is being guided every step of DT way and he will be irresistible to America . "" PRP sat RB not knowing what to say . She was obviously very happy IN DT Communists were doing this and IN PRP MD somehow be a thumbing of their collective noses at America : PRP MD give PRP a black NN and he'd be a Communist to boot . She made PRP quite obvious IN she thought IN this was VBG to breathe JJ life into NN Communism . From this and other conversations with her , she always asserted IN Communism was far from dead . She was full of little details about him IN she was eager to relate . I thought IN maybe she was trying to show off IN this truly was a real person and not just hot air . She rattled off a complete litany . He was from Hawaii . He went to school in California . He lived in Chicago . He was soon to be elected to DT legislature . "" Have no doubt : he is CD of PRP , a Soviet . "" At CD point , she related some sort of San Francisco connection , but I did n't understand what DT point was and do n't recall much about DT . I was just left with DT notion IN she considered DT city to be some sort of a center for their activity here . Since I had dabbled in languages , I knew a smattering of Arabic . I made a comment : "" If I remember correctly , ' Barack ' comes from DT Arabic word for ' Blessing . ' DT seems to be an odd name for an American . "" She replied quickly , "" Yes . PRP is ' African ' "" , she insisted , "" and he will be a blessing for NN Communism . PRP will regain our strength and become DT number CD power in DT NN . "" She continued with something to DT effect IN America was at DT same NN DT great hope and DT great obstacle for Communism . America MD have to be converted to Communism and Barack was VBG to pave DT way . So , what does this conversation from 1992 prove ? Well , PRP 's definitely anecdotal . PRP does n't prove IN Obama has had Soviet Communist training nor IN he was groomed to be DT first black American NN , but PRP does show CD thing WDT I VBP is very important . PRP shows IN Soviet Russian Communists knew of Barack from a very early date . PRP RB shows IN PRP truly believed among themselves IN he was raised and groomed Communist to pave DT way for their future . This report on Barack came personally to me from CD of them long before America knew he existed . Although I had never before heard of him , at DT NN of this conversation Obama was 30 + NNS old and was obviously tested enough IN he was their anticipated rising star ."

PRP did n’t take long from DT birth of DT NN wide web for DT NN to start using this JJ medium to transmit , collect and analyze information in ways never before imagined . DT first message boards and clunky “ Web 1.0 ” websites soon gave way to “ DT blogosphere . ” DT arrival of social NN was DT next step in this evolution , allowing for DT formation of communities of interest to share information in real NN about events happening anywhere on DT globe . But as quickly as communities began to form around these JJ platforms , governments and militaries were even quicker in recognizing DT potential to use this JJ medium to more effectively spread their own propaganda . Their goal ? To shape JJ discourse around JJ events in a way favourable to their standing military and geopolitical objectives . Their method ? DT Weaponization of Social NNP . This is DT Corbett Report . Facebook . Twitter . YouTube . Snapchat . Instagram . Reddit . “ Social NN ” as PRP VBP PRP today barely existed fifteen NNS ago . Although PRP provides JJ ways to interact with NNS and information from all across DT NN virtually instantaneously and virtually for free , PRP are only now beginning to understand DT depths of DT problems associated with these JJ platforms . More and more of DT original developers of social NN sites IN Facebook and Twitter admit PRP no longer use social NN themselves and actively keep PRP away from their NNS , and now PRP are finally admitting DT reason why : social NN was designed specifically to take advantage of your psychological weaknesses and keep PRP addicted to your screen . SEAN PARKER : If DT thought process WDT went into building these applications — Facebook being DT first of them to really understand PRP — DT thought process was all about “ How do PRP consume as much of your NN and conscious attention as possible ? ” And DT means IN PRP need to sort of give PRP a little dopamine hit every once in a while because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever , and DT ’s gonna VB PRP to contribute more content and DT ’s gonna VB PRP more likes and comments . So PRP ’s a social validation feedback loop . I mean PRP ’s exactly DT kind of thing WDT a hacker IN myself MD come up with , because PRP ’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology . And I VBP IN PRP — DT inventors / creators , PRP VBP , PRP ’s me , PRP ’s Mark , PRP ’s Kevin Systrom at Instagram , PRP ’s all of these NNS — understood this consciously and PRP did PRP anyway . PRP should be no surprise , then , IN in this NN of social NN addicts and smartphone zombies , DT 24/7 newsfeed is taking up a greater and greater share of NNS ’s lives . Our thoughts , our opinions , our knowledge of DT NN , even our mood are increasingly being influenced or even determined by what PRP see being posted , tweeted or vlogged . And DT process by which these NNS shape our opinions is being carefully monitored and analyzed , not by DT social NN companies themselves , but by DT NNP military . MARINA PORTNAYA : When DT NN ’s largest social NN platform betrays its users , EX ’s VBG to be outrage . ABC HOST : DT NN to see whether Facebook MD influence DT emotional NN of its users on DT NN feed . CNN ANCHOR : PRP allowed researchers to manipulate almost 700,000 users ’ NN feeds . Some saw more positive NN about their friends , others saw more negative . CNN GUEST : Well I ’m not surprised . I mean PRP ’re all kind of lab rat than DT big Facebook experiment . PORTNAYA : But PRP was n’t only Facebook ’s experiment . PRP turns out DT psychological NN was connected to DT NNP NN ’s research on social unrest . MORNING JOE GUEST : This is really kind of creepy . PORTNAYA : And PRP gets worse . What PRP MD not VB is IN DT NNP Department of Defense has reportedly spent roughly $ 20 million conducting studies aimed at learning how to manipulate online behavior in order to influence opinion . DT initiative was launched in 2011 by DT Pentagon ’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , otherwise known as DARPA . DT program is best described as DT NNP NN ’s effort to become better at detecting and conducting propaganda campaigns via social NN . Translation : When anti-government messages gain ground virally , Washington wants to find a way to spread counter opinion . DT DARPA document WDT details DT Pentagon ’s plans for influencing opinions in DT social NN space is called “ Social NNP in Strategic Communication . ” DARPA ’s goal , according to their own website , is “ to develop tools to help identify misinformation or deception campaigns and counter them with truthful information . ” Exactly what tools were developed for this purpose and how PRP are currently being deployed is unclear . But Rand Walzman , DT program ’s creator , admitted last NN IN DT project lasted four NNS , cost $ 50 million and led to DT publication of over 200 papers . DT papers , including “ Incorporating Human Cognitive Biases in a Probabilistic Model of Retweeting , ” “ Structural Properties of Ego Networks , ” and “ Sentiment Prediction using Collaborative Filtering , ” make DT thrust of DT program perfectly clear . Social NN users are lab rats being carefully scrutinized by NN - supported researchers , their tweets and Facebook posts and Instagram pictures being analyzed to determine how information spreads online , and , by implication , how DT NN and DT military can use these social NN networks to make their own propaganda “ VB viral . ” As worrying as this research is , PRP pales in comparison to DT knowledge IN governments , militaries and political lobby groups are already employing squadrons of foot soldiers to wage information warfare in DT social NN battlespace . CTV ANCHOR : So is PRP okay to have DT NN monitor social NN conversations and then to wade in and correct some of those conversations ? With more on this , let ’s VB to technology expert Carmi Levy . He ’s on DT line from Montreal . Carmi , do PRP VB DT NN ’s monitoring what PRP and I are saying right now ? Is this whole thing getting out of line , or what ? CARMI LEVY : PRP opens up a bit of a question . I ’d VB to call PRP a Pandora ’s box about , PRP VBP , what exactly is DT NN ’s aim here , and what do PRP hope to accomplish with what PRP find out ? And as PRP accumulate this information online — this data on PRP — where does DT data VB ? And so I VBP as much as PRP should applaud DT NN for getting into this area , DT optics of PRP are potentially very Big Brother -ish . And DT NN really does need to be a little bit more concrete on what its intentions are and how PRP intends to achieve them . 4WWL REPORTER : JJ evidence IN NN - owned computers at DT Army Corps of Engineers office here in NNP Orleans are being used to verbally attack critics of DT Corps comes in an affidavit from DT former editor - in - chief of nola.com . Jon Donley , who was laid off this past February , tells PRP via satellite from Texas , in late 2006 he started noticing NNS presenting themselves as ordinary citizens defending DT Corps very energetically . JON DONLEY : What stuck out , though , was DT wording of DT comments was in JJ ways mirroring NN releases from DT Corps of Engineers . SANDY ROSENTHAL : These commenters tried to discredit these NNS . . . 4WWL REPORTER : And when Rosenthal investigated , she discovered DT comments were coming from users at DT internet provider address of DT Army Corps of Engineers offices here in NNP Orleans . She blamed DT Corps for a strategy of VBG after critics . ROSENTHAL : In DT process of trying to obscure DT facts of DT NNP Orleans floodings , CD of their tactics was just verbal abuse . These operations are only DT visible and publicly - admitted front of a vast array of military and intelligence programs WDT are attempting to influence online behaviour , spread NN propaganda , and disrupt online communities WDT arise in opposition to their agenda . IN such programs exist is not a matter of conjecture ; PRP is mundane , established , documented fact . In 2014 , an internal document was leaked from GCHQ , DT British equivalent of DT NSA . DT document , never intended for JJ release , was entitled “ DT Art of Deception : Training for a NNP Generation of Online Covert Operations ” and bluntly stated IN “ PRP VBP to build Cyber Magicians . ” PRP then goes on to outline DT “ magic ” techniques WDT must be employed in influence and information operations online , including deception and manipulation techniques IN “ anchoring , ” “ priming ” and “ branding ” propaganda narratives . After presenting a map of social networking technologies WDT are targeted by these operations , DT document then instructs DT “ magicians ” how to deceive DT NN through “ attention management ” and behavioural manipulation . IN governments MD turn to these strategies is hardly a shocking development . In fact , DT use of NN shills to propagate NN talking points and disrupt online dissent has been openly advocated on DT record by high - ranking NN officials for DT past decade . In 2008 , Cass Sunstein , a law professor who MD VB on to become Obama ’s information “ czar , ” co-authored a paper entitled “ NN Theories , ” in which he wrote IN DT “ best response ” to online “ NN theories ” is what he calls “ cognitive infiltration ” of groups spreading these ideas . PRP is perhaps particularly ironic IN DT idea IN NN agents are actually and admittedly spreading propaganda online under false identities is , to DT less - informed members of DT population , itself a “ NN theory ” rather than an established NN fact . Unsurprisingly , when confronted about his proposal , Sunstein pretended to not remember having written PRP and then pointedly refused to answer any questions about PRP . Now , a decade on from Sunstein ’s proposal , PRP VBP IN military psyops agents , political lobbyists , corporate shills and NN propagandists are spending vast sums of money and employing entire armies of keyboard warriors , leaving comments and shaping conversations to VB DT NN ’s opinions , influence their behaviour , and even alter their mood . And PRP are helped along in this quest by DT very same technology WDT allows DT NN to connect on a scale never before possible . Technology is always a double - edged sword , and sometimes PRP can be dangerous to wield DT sword at all . EX are ways to identify and neutralize DT threat of online trolls and shills , but DT phenomenon is not likely to VB away any NN soon . Each of PRP must find our own answer to DT question of how best to incorporate these technologies into our life . But DT next NN PRP find yourself caught up in an argument with an online persona WDT MD or MD not be a genuine human being , PRP might be better to ask yourself if your efforts are better spent engaging in DT argument or just turning off DT computer ."

Fractals are patterns formed from chaotic equations and contain self - similar patterns of complexity increasing with magnification . If PRP divide a fractal pattern into parts PRP VBP a nearly identical reduced - size copy of DT whole . DT mathematical beauty of fractals is IN infinite complexity is formed with relatively simple equations . By iterating or repeating fractal - generating equations JJ times , random outputs create beautiful patterns WDT are unique , yet recognizable . PRP have pulled together some of DT most stunning natural examples PRP MD find of fractals on our NN . Above : This variant form of cauliflower is DT ultimate fractal vegetable . Its pattern is a natural representation of DT Fibonacci or golden spiral , a logarithmic spiral where every quarter turn is farther from DT origin by a factor of phi , DT golden ratio . Image : Flickr / Tin.G. DT San Francisco Bay salt flats pictured above have been used for commercial salt production for over a century . Below , an image from DT largest salt flat in DT NN , Salar de Uyuni , located in southern Bolivia . DT encrusted salt shows a remarkably consistent but random pattern , a characteristic of fractals . Images : 1 ) Flickr / Tolka Rover . 2 ) Flickr / Mike D. Green . Extinct for 65 million NNS , ammonites were marine cephalopods WDT built chambered spiral shells . DT walls between these chambers , called sutures , were complex fractal curves . Stephen Jay Gould used DT complexity of ammonite sutures over NN to argue IN EX is no evolutionary drive toward greater complexity and IN PRP are a "" glorious accident , "" alone in DT universe . DT shells of ammonites RB grow as a logarithmic spiral , a pattern WDT appears often in nature , as with romanesco broccoli . Ammonites RB inspired this cathedral staircase in Barcelona , Spain . Images : 1 ) Flickr / cobalt123 . 2 ) Flickr / Didier.bier . 3 ) Flickr / Edgley Cesar Mountains are DT result of tectonic forces pushing DT crust upward and erosion tearing some of DT crust down .

DT Himalayas are still being uplifted by DT collision of India with DT Eurasian plate , which began about 70 million NNS ago . Image : NASA / GSFC / JPL , MISR Team . Ferns are a common example of a self - similar set , meaning IN their pattern can be mathematically generated and reproduced at any magnification or reduction . DT mathematical formula WDT describes ferns , named after Michael Barnsley , was CD of DT first to show IN chaos is inherently unpredictable yet generally follows deterministic rules based on nonlinear iterative equations . In other words , random numbers generated over and over using Barnsley 's Fern formula ultimately produce a unique fern - shaped object . Images : 1 ) Flickr / cobalt123 . 2 ) Flickr / CatDancing .

Below , DT 200 - mile long series of cloud vortexes is perhaps DT longest of these formations ever photographed , according to NASA . These cloud vortexes are RB called von Kármán cloud streets , for DT late fluid dynamicist Theodore von Kármán . Cloud streets form when low - lying clouds are interrupted by an object such as an island . Similar patterns occur in DT wind flow downstream of airplane wings .

Seen as DT “ JJ age of exploration ” , DT 21st century promises to solve some of DT most intriguing puzzles of our current history . NNS are still discussing DT purpose of DT Nazca lines . Do these complex geoglyphs in Peru symbolize constellations ? Are PRP compared to giant alien landing spots , or are these signs showing DT way for their ships ? For now , no theory seems plausible enough when PRP comes to explaining their purpose . These are DT famous Nazca lines , a mystery WDT has concerned countless researchers for over 80 NNS . These mysterious markings were built on DT ground , but can only be seen from above . PRP ’s worth mentioning IN DT area is mostly flat and cannot offer a higher view of DT glyphs . DT Nazca Lines can be found in DT Nazca Desert , a barren plateau WDT expands between DT city of Nasca and Palpa on DT pampa , which is a smooth , desolated area of southern Peru . PRP cover - up an era of desert of nearly 400 square miles . Overall , EX are more than 800 successive lines , 300 geometric figures and 70 animal and plant designs . Some of DT straight lines stretch over 30 miles , while DT other designs range from 50 to 1,200 feet in length , being as large as DT Empire NNP Building . Enormous geoglyphs are found in other places on NNP , such as Egypt , Chile , Bolivia , DT NNP NNPS ( Mississippi and California ) , Malta and in other NNS . However , DT Nazca geoglyphs form an impressive and mysterious archaeological group because of their number , range , typical features as well as cultural continuity and preservation over DT centuries . DT Nazca plain is remarkable for its ability to maintain DT markings intact over a long period of NN . Because DT NN is CD of DT driest on NNP , recording only twenty minutes of rainfall each NN , and DT rocky soil which reduces DT effect of wind at ground level , this barren place is ideal for preserving a work of art for eternity . DT clarity and positioning of DT lines and drawings leave no doubt IN an exhaustive and long - term effort was instrumental in their creation . EX are diverse designs consisting of shapes of animals , plants , objects , flowers , and even huge manlike figures made with well - defined lines . DT most renowned drawing is of a weird being looking similar to an astronaut . Measuring close to 100 feet in length , PRP was discovered by Maria Reiche in DT 1960’s . Another curious representation is of a strange being with two huge , monstrous hands , CD of them possessing only four fingers . South of DT Nazca Lines , on DT pampa , archaeologists have discovered DT ancient city of DT line - builders – Cahuachi . PRP was constructed almost two thousand NNS ago and was inexplicably deserted 500 NNS later . Recent findings at Cahuachi are starting to slowly blow DT dust off this ancient mystery . Italian researcher Giuseppe Orefici has been uncovering DT site ’s secrets for DT past decades , bringing a team down each NN . He concluded IN DT settlement ’s population was quite small , but DT city was RB a pilgrimage center WDT brought a huge increase in population whenever ceremonial events occurred . These events seemingly concerned DT Nazca Lines and DT colossal sand dune of Nasca . This theory seems very plausible because of DT archaeological evidence provided by DT Nazca lines , showing creatures such as a killer whales and monkeys , which did not exist in DT Nazca region . Because of DT arid NN DT recent findings consist of clothing and amazingly preserved mummified bodies of DT Nazca NNS . Archaeologist Fredrik Hiebert considers IN our current progress in technology will help in solving this ancient mystery :"

"" DT surprise was what happened to Xena ( Lucy Lawless ) and her sidekick , Gabrielle ( played by Reneé O'Connor ) . PRP were crucified by DT Romans . NNS dying and coming back are fairly common in DT "" Xena "" universe , but coming back from a season - ending crucifixion called for something more than just a shower scene in DT fall . So this week 's fifth - season premiere , "" Fallen Angel , "" sets something of a record for hour - long television shows , thanks to 270 special - effect shots in which Xena carries on DT good fight in DT afterlife . "" Xena "" is written and shot in NNP Zealand , but DT special effects are made at Flat NNP Productions Inc. in Burbank , California . When DT Flat NNP crew saw DT "" Fallen Angel "" script , says 3 - D effects supervisor Mark Tamny , EX was "" shock at first . And then PRP start to come up with a plan to figure out how PRP 're actually VBG to achieve all DT shots -- how PRP 's all VBG to come together . "" DT special - effects crew gets involved in every part of a production of this kind , from piecing together real elements to embellishing DT truth with realistic - looking fakes . In CD shot , PRP might start off with Lawless as an archdemon , shot against a blue screen . DT 's part of DT "" chroma key "" process WDT allows DT development of composite images used in television in JJ weather forecasts and in film for special effects . And what effects -- behind Lawless goes a painted background : some digital rocky pillars , a squadron of flying digital demons , and after a few hundred hours of work , magic . To make DT magic happen , DT actor is shot in front of a blue screen ( 1 ) , then a background is created ( 2 ) , and flying demons are animated ( 3 ) . Then all are composited together for a final shot ( 4 ) . Some of DT shots , IN evil Callisto ( Hudson Leick ) drop - kicking a hapless angel , were delivered on film . But DT special effects crew had to erase DT wires WDT held him up , speed up DT angel 's motion and even add some digital - camera motion . "" PRP did n't VB PRP to look IN if this was a real environment WDT PRP actually just planted a camera on CD of these pillars , "" says composing artist Todd Vaziri . "" PRP wanted to give PRP DT impression IN maybe PRP was from a helicopter , or some kind of a gliding mechanism or something . "" Some of DT flying sequences MD n't be done with real actors on wires , so digital stand - ins were created on DT drafting board . "" What PRP deliver is different elements , "" says Mark Kochinski , another 3 - D effects supervisor , as he shows off his work . "" UH , this is Xena flying , and then this is DT beam of light she 's flying through . And then when DT shot is composited , PRP can see her flying through DT clouds , which are a separate element . "" Some effects executed on film in NNP Zealand needed some high - tech touch ups in California , among them archangel Gabrielle 's wings , which did n't work on film . "" PRP went into DT shot , "" says Kochinski , "" removed DT wings WDT she was wearing , created some three - dimensional wings WDT were a bit more animated and then married them to her body for DT shot . "" "" Xena , Warrior Princess "" carries DT battle way beyond real life almost every week . But in order to VB this far -- IN past life itself -- and come back next week , PRP sure helps to VB some special - effects wizards .

Acting on a hunch , Léon Foucault had determined IN he MD use a pendulum to illustrate DT effect of DT NNP ’s movement . He called together a group of NNS , enticing them with a note declaring , “ PRP are invited to see DT NNP turn . ” Foucault hung a pendulum from DT ceiling of DT Meridian Room of DT Paris Observatory . As PRP swept through DT air , PRP traced a pattern WDT effectively proved DT NN was spinning about an axis . A month later , Foucault shared his experiment with all of Paris at DT majestic Pantheon building . According to DT American Physical Society , he suspended from DT Pantheon ’s lofty dome a 61 - pound brass bob on a 220 - foot cable . As PRP swung back and forth , DT pointed end of DT bob traced lines in sand WDT had been poured on a wooden platform . Over NN , DT angle of these lines changed , suggesting to audience members IN DT direction of DT pendulum ’s travel was shifting under DT influence of an unperceived rotational motion — WDT of NNP . Foucault was able to demonstrate a scientific concept in a way IN DT average person MD easily grasp , says Rebecca C. Thompson , head of JJ outreach for DT APS . For centuries , PRP was a commonly held belief IN DT NNP rotated on an axis . But PRP was Foucault who dispelled lingering doubts once and for all , establishing DT phenomenon firmly in DT realm of fact . “ PRP really started DT cultural shift to fundamentally understanding our universe differently , ” Thompson says . DT experiment was a hit , drawing flocks of fascinated Parisians and catapulting Foucault to fame . Pendulums based on Foucault ’s calculations began appearing worldwide — and are still iconic features of JJ NN museums in DT U.S. and other NNS . DT Smithsonian Institution made a pendulum a focal point of its Museum of History and Technology ( which later became DT National Museum of American History ) . DT building — which opened in 1964 on DT National Mall in Washington , D.C. — was designed purposely to accommodate a pendulum . PRP hung from DT ceiling of DT third floor and stretched 71 feet through DT center of DT building , where PRP swung slowly and rhythmically across a fancifully emblazoned circle on DT first floor . DT Smithsonian pendulum was intended to be viewed from above , on DT second floor . Looking down , visitors MD see a symmetrical hollow brass bob weighing about 240 pounds and shaped IN an inverted teardrop . As PRP moved back and forth — facilitated by an electromagnetic push to keep PRP continuously swinging despite air resistance and vibrations in DT cable — PRP MD knock down inch - or - so - high pins standing at fixed points along DT circumference of a small circle . Over NN , viewers MD see DT direction of DT pendulum ’s swing NN , implying IN DT NNP was rotating beneath them . DT Smithsonian pendulum , IN all pendulums , moved in accordance with Foucault ’s sine law , which predicts how much a pendulum ’s path will distort each day based on its latitude . Absent any exterior forces , a pendulum MD swing back and forth in a single plane forever — EX MD be no gradual angular shift . But DT NNP is rotating , so DT story is n’t RB simple . Since all points on NNP ’s surface rotate as a unit , PRP follows IN those located on DT wider portions of DT NN — nearer to DT equator — must cover more meters each second ( i.e. , VB faster ) to “ keep up ” with DT points tracing smaller circles each day at DT extreme northern and southern latitudes . Though PRP do n’t feel PRP , a person standing in Quito , Ecuador , is moving with appreciably higher velocity than CD in Reykjavik , Iceland . Because each swing of a pendulum takes PRP from a point farther from DT equator to a point nearer to DT equator and vice versa , and DT velocities at these points differ , DT path of DT pendulum is subtly distorted with every swing , gradually torqued away from its original orientation . DT extent of this effect depends on where on NNP DT pendulum is swinging . At DT North Pole — where small changes in latitude have big implications — DT path traced by a pendulum MD shift through a full 360 degrees in a mere 24 hours , explains Thompson . At DT equator , meanwhile , a pendulum ’s motion MD not be seen to distort at all . Using his sine law , Foucault predicted IN DT path of his pendulum in Paris MD shift 11.25 degrees each hour , or 270 degrees in a day . And PRP did . His sine law allows anyone with a decent grounding in trigonometry to use a pendulum to determine their latitude . But mostly , at museums around DT NN , DT pendulum has become an object WDT elicits wonder . As iconic as DT elephant WDT greets visitors in DT rotunda of DT Smithsonian ’s National Museum of Natural History , DT pendulum at DT History and Technology museum was a meeting place , a striking backdrop for reflection and education . “ PRP was very much IN a fountain in a park , ” says Peter Liebhold , a curator in DT division of work and industry at DT American History Museum . NNS and adults alike MD stare at DT pendulum , meditating on its motion and meaning . CD morning in 1998 , before DT museum had opened , DT cable snapped , sending DT massive bob hurtling towards DT floor , narrowly missing a staffer . Rather than repair DT cable , DT museum elected to retire Foucault ’s pendulum . Its director at DT NN decided DT device did not have much to do with either America or history , says Liebhold . DT decision divided staffers . “ EX were pendulum huggers and pendulum haters , ” Liebhold says . Pro-pendulum employees VBD PRP was cool and fun to watch . DT anti-pendulum group believed PRP did n’t add much to DT museum ’s efforts to teach DT NN about American history and culture . Though Liebhold says he was in DT haters ’ camp , he believes pendulums have their place , just elsewhere . A pendulum “ makes DT masses more trusting of DT power of NN , ” he says . Thompson agrees , and notes IN while DT pendulum is no longer needed to prove IN DT NNP rotates , “ PRP is useful if PRP can VB kids engaged in NN . ”"

Upon waking nearly four hours later , unbeknownst to Beltran , he believes a Radio - Frequency IDentification ( RFID ) chip had been implanted in DT rear area of his mouth where DT lower and upper jaws connect . During a November 29 interview , Beltran told this writer , “ A recent girlfriend of mine WDT was associated with law enforcement took me to a dentist WDT I ’d never before visited . Without my consent , DT dentist used a very unusual looking syringe and knocked me out for between three and four hours . Since I ’d been in DT JJ field for over 20 NNS , I ’m familiar with syringes , and this large - gauge needle looked IN DT old - style equipment WDT military doctors used . ” DT horrors got worse during this procedure . Beltran continued his account : “ When I regained consciousness three to four hours later , my entire chest was drenched in saliva . Supposedly , I had received two root canals and had two teeth capped . But after visiting a different dentist earlier this NN , his X - rays revealed IN only CD root canal had been performed , and no crowns put in place . ” In an extensive portfolio presented to this newspaper , Beltran provided a series of X - rays and MRI scans WDT show what appear to be two foreign bodies in DT back portion of his mouth . Beltran claims two different doctors have confirmed these results . When asked if he has experienced any physical afflictions as a result , Beltran replied , “ A former Marine told me IN similar RFID chips are used by DT U.S. military on prisoners in Afghanistan to send and receive information . DT device in my mouth is approximately DT size of a grain of rice , and depending on DT frequencies being transmitted , I undergo nausea , vertigo , hearing loss and swollen glands . Plus , because [ I have a ] technical background , I can hear a ‘ 60 - cycle whine . ’ ” To clarify this phenomenon , Beltran explained , “ This 60 - cycle whine is an electrical sound emitted from DT device , but with a higher pitch WDT I hear originating from around my right ear , but not exactly . ” When Beltran visited a local district attorney with his X - rays , he was told , “ This was done because of something PRP VBP IN somebody wants , or PRP do n’t VB PRP to say something . ” DT district attorney then told Beltran about S.B. 362 , introduced by NN senator Joe Simitian ( D - Palo Alto ) , which VBZ IN “ subdermal implantation of RFID chips in DT NN of California against a person ’s consent ” is illegal . Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed this legislation in 2007 . “ Why MD EX need to be such a law in DT first place unless these procedures were already being performed ? ” asked Beltran . DT obvious question at this point is : Why MD someone VB to implant an RFID device in Beltran ’s mouth ? This is where DT story gets eerie . Beltran provided DT answer . “ In 1991 I was DT supervisor for a private ambulance company in Sacramento when PRP were dispatched to DT scene of a high - speed pursuit involving DT potential kidnapping of a four - or five - NN - old girl , ” he VBD . “ DT suspect was apprehended and dragged from his car by law enforcement officers and then beaten to death . However , PRP turned out IN DT suspect was actually DT little girl ’s father , and PRP was n’t a kidnapping , but a custody issue . So , this child ’s father was beaten to death with billy clubs before her very eyes . ” He added : “ After I tried to write a report about what I ’d witnessed , my supervisor told me to keep my mouth shut or I ’d be blacklisted . DT ’s when DT cover - up began . ” Still , why MD this incident affect Beltran nearly two decades later to DT extent IN an invasive JJ procedure was perhaps conducted without his knowledge and against his will ? “ DT motive leads back to me witnessing a murder WDT now affects DT candidates ( in a local 2010 sheriff ’s election ) who were in charge of DT cover - up , ” he VBD . “ Last NN , I emailed CD of DT candidates and asked : If a law enforcement officer is informed of a murder , are PRP required to report PRP ? Twenty minutes later I received a phone call from CD of DT officers associated with DT cover - up of this murder . If this information is divulged , PRP will completely ruin DT sheriff ’s election [ in November 2010 ] . A colleague has RB told me IN DT sheriff ’s department and local FBI are behind what has happened to me . ” Although California politicians such as Senator Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) and Representative Dan Lungren ( D - Calif . ) have offered no help , nor has local NN , Beltran says TruTV and Jesse Ventura have shown an interest in filming DT surgery when DT RFID device is removed from his mouth . Beltran has RB met with an area district attorney , who has yet to decide whether DT crimes committed against him fall under local jurisdiction or DT of DT USA PATRIOT Act and domestic terrorism .

As PRP had previously reported on in our August 3rd report titled “ Russia Burns , NNP Drowns : NNP To Blame ? ” Russian research scientist Dr. Andrey Areshev has joined DT ranks of International NNS and experts stating their belief IN DT extreme weather chaos currently battering our NNP is being caused by DT Tesla technology based weapons systems directed from ’s High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program , otherwise known as HAARP . Now according to this GRU report , Senator Stevens was approached less than a fortnight ago by his longtime friend and Alaskan bush pilot Theron “ Terry ” Smith whose son- in - law , Alaskan Air National Guard Major Aaron W. Malone , was killed on July 28th after having his C - 17 NNP Military aircraft “ targeted ” by a HAARP “ Tesla Beam ” while in DT air over Anchorage , Alaska causing PRP to crash and explode upon impact killing all aboard . [ Note : DT Russian translation for “ targeted ” as used in this report does not assign HARRP blame as PRP includes an “ accidental ” verb component . ] Upon Senator Stevens beginning his investigation into HAARP ’s causing DT crash of DT Major Malone ’s C - 17 , this report continues , he enlisted DT aid of two powerful power brokers , oil fortune heir William “ Bill ” Phillips Sr. and former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe . Phillips was a longtime ally and supporter of Senator Stevens and as DT heir to DT Phillips Petroleum fortune is VBN in these reports to have in DT past used his vast fortune to privately finance NNP intelligence “ activities ” to support his NNS efforts to gain access to JJ oil reserves . Phillips had long warned Americans IN PRP does not have any big oil companies . And PRP ’s true : DT largest American oil company , Exxon Mobil , is only DT 14th largest in DT NNP and is dwarfed by DT really big oil companies -- all owned by foreign governments or NN - sponsored monopolies -- WDT dominate DT NNP 's oil supply . With 94 % of DT NNP 's oil supply locked up by foreign governments , most of which are hostile to DT , DT relatively puny American oil companies do not have access to enough crude oil to significantly affect DT market and help bring prices down . Thus , ExxonMobil , a “ small ” oil company , buys 90 % of DT crude oil WDT PRP refines for DT market from DT big players , i.e. , mostly - hostile foreign governments . O’Keefe was DT former administrator for DT Untied NNPS space agency NASA from 2001 - 2005 , and whose reign included DT Space Shuttle Columbia disaster WDT occurred on February 1 , 2003 , when upon its reentry into NNP ’s atmosphere disintegrated over Texas , and which this report says O’Keefe “ always ” blamed on HAARP because at DT exact NN of this tragedy PRP had begun transmitting in what is called “ deep NN communication mode ” . [ Note : During DT "" Navy Deep - NNP Communication "" operational mode , DT shortwave radio pulses are all , with military precision , exactly 6.25 seconds long with either exactly 15 or 30 second spaces between pulses . Those long and short binary spaces in between DT pulses are actually DT coded message . Something IN DT dits and dahs of very slow Morse code . In this mode , DT power is usually at maximum . Unlike DT research mode , which mostly runs at night , DT NNP Navy communication mode can be at any NN of DT day or night , any month of DT NN . DT transmissions MD run continuously for about 10 to 30 hours , or from CD to several days . Following DT 9 - 11 NNP Trade Center attack , and just minutes after DT NNP declared DT highest Defense Condition Four ( DefCon4 ) , HAARP began transmitting at highest power for 18 hours in "" deep- NN communication "" mode . This is DT only way to communicate DT DefCon4 condition and updated battle commands to DT NNP nuclear submarines on station miles deep in DT ocean . ] DT various transmission ranges of HAARP are important to note , this report says , as “ immediately prior ” to Senator Stevens plane VBG down Russian satellites orbiting over DT Arctic detected a “ powerful ” 3.39 megahertz signal emanating from HAARP ’s Copper Valley Area , Gakona , Alaska base and “ directed ” over DT region this tragedy occurred in . According to NNP NN reports Phillips was killed in this crash [ photo 2nd left ] and O’Keefe is in hospital in critical condition , and with Senator Stevens being killed RB means their investigation into HAARP has died along with them . To DT chaos erupting all over DT NNP as DT result of Obama ’s allowing DT use of these catastrophic HAARP “ weather weapons ” PRP can only be described as being “ biblical ” in DT apocalyptic destruction PRP is causing , and which includes : Ø DT greatest heatwave and destructive fires has experienced in over 1,000 NNS . Ø DT greatest flooding has experienced in over 800 NNS . Ø Flooding in so epic DT NNP Nations has named this megadisaster as being worse than DT 2004 tsunami WDT shattered DT basin . Ø Flooding so catastrophic in DT death toll is soaring into DT thousands . Ø A heatwave so terrible in PRP has caused its hospitals to be flooded with over 21,000 heatstroke victims . Ø A heatwave of unprecedented proportions WDT has gripped DT eastern and southern parts of DT this summer and shows no signs of abating . Ø Temperatures so low in DT western WDT farmers in are now reporting their fruits and vegetables are being destroyed . Ø A catastrophic drought hitting Africa WDT has put over 10 million NNS in immediate danger of starvation death . Ø A catastrophic winter occurring in South America WDT has killed in Bolivia alone between 3 - 6 million fish and thousands of cattle in Brazil , and hundreds of NNS . To what is linking these JJ weather catastrophes PRP can read as reported by ’s Channel 4 NN NN correspondent Tom Clarke who in his video report titled “ Turbo - Charged Monsoon Confounds Forecasters ” NNS : “ Normally DT jet stream is a giant loop of high speed winds WDT whip round DT upper atmosphere . DT jet stream is n't involved in day to day weather - it's too high up - but because PRP pushes DT atmosphere around PRP 's very important in steering large scale weather patterns below . DT stream has split in two . CD arm has gone north , another south . DT patch in DT middle is Russia 's drought . A circulating pattern of air has been sitting over Russia for far longer than normal , causing DT extreme temperatures and wildfires PRP 've had RB . But what 's happening over Pakistan is even stranger . DT southern arm of DT Jet stream has looped down so far PRP has crossed over DT Himalayas into north western Pakistan . Experts at DT Met Office tell me this is very unusual . And DT result is IN DT fast moving jets stream winds high up has helped suck DT warm , wet , monsoon air even faster and higher into DT atmosphere - and DT has caused rains IN no - PRP can remember . PRP has turbo charged DT monsoon if PRP VBP . PRP 're not sure DT 's ever happened before . ” To HAARP ’s ability to affect our NNP ’s jet streams PRP can further read from a report prepared in DT 1990 ’s by DT NNP Air Force and which , in part , VBZ : “ HAARP ( High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program ) , being constructed for DT Air Force and Navy by an ARCO subsidiary , is such a project . Touted as scientific research , HAARP is a thinly disguised project to "" perturb "" DT ionosphere with extremely powerful beams of NN to see what military uses PRP can serve . According to DT HAARP RFP , these NN beams will be used to "" control ionospheric processes in such a way as to greatly enhance DT performance of C3 systems ( or , to deny accessibility to an adversary ) . "" DT sounds IN a weapon to this writer . Other such projects VBP by DT code names BIME , RED AIR , CRRES , EXCEDE , CHARGE IV , WISP , ACTIVE , HIPAS , RADC , AIM , etc . . Nuclear bombs exploded in high altitude tests in DT late fifties and early sixties by both DT U.S.S.R. and DT U.S. caused weather and jet stream changes WDT lasted almost 20 NNS . Do DT HAARP heaters offer DT same potential as PRP "" perturb "" DT ionosphere ? DT ionosphere is home to JJ beneficial natural phenomena among them filtering DT sun 's harmful rays and reflecting radio waves used for communications . Although not totally understood , DT ionosphere RB directly effects DT weather systems and DT jet streams . ” To DT reasons for Obama unleashing of HAARP weapons upon our NN PRP had touched on in our August 3rd report “ Russia Burns , NNP Drowns : NNP To Blame ? ” and though not conclusive contains : Ø DT catastrophic flooding in and apocalyptic heat and fires in put both of these enemies in DT position of having to ask DT Americans for food aid as their summer crops are being destroyed on an unprecedented basis . Ø DT epic flooding occurring in is effectively destroying DT Nations ability to both feed and defend itself and whom Obama has labeled as CD of DT Americans number CD enemies . Ø DT devastating heat occurring in DT NNP NNPS will enable Obama to push through DT NNP Congress a “ JJ NN ” tax agenda JJ believe will be DT “ final nail ” needed to destroy DT NNP NNPS as a major NNP Power . To DT “ unintended consequences ” of Obama ’s “ weather war ” against DT NNP PRP can now only glimpse as DT wholesale destruction of summer crops in DT Northern Hemisphere is now warned will cause food riots as inflationary pressures upon what little food is left to feed our NNP can very well push PRP all into Total NNP War . And finally , though PRP do not VB what DT outcome of these momentous events will be , PRP is in our knowing to warn , IN above all else , everyone reading these words should make DT storing of food their top priority as this Summer of Woe will surely become a Winter of Discontent . © August 11 , 2010 EU and NNP all rights reserved .

This is a simple fact IN humans have known for thousands of NNS ; PRP was incontrovertibly confirmed as soon as DT Soviet Union launched DT Sputnik 1 satellite in 1957 and PRP went … PRP VBP ... around DT globe . Nevertheless , a small but vocal group of NNS who insist IN DT NN is flat — so - called — have emerged online in recent NNS , and PRP seem to be sowing doubt about this most basic aspect of reality . JJ flat - Earthers put a great deal of effort into concocting alternative explanations for why DT NN behaves as if PRP 's round when PRP 's actually flat — even though a spherical NNP clearly fits DT observations humans have made about DT NN over DT last few millennia . However , if NNP , somehow , were truly flat , PRP MD not behave much IN DT NN PRP VBP today . In fact , humanity ( and everything else ) MD be very , very dead . Related : Are Flat - Earthers Being Serious ? To shape a cosmic body into a disk ( rather than a sphere ) , PRP 've got to spin PRP very fast , says David Stevenson , a planetary scientist at Caltech in Pasadena , California . This MD , unfortunately , destroy DT NN by tearing PRP into tiny particles . In DT 1850s , astronomer James Clerk Maxwell showed mathematically IN a solid , disk - JJ shape is n't a stable configuration in DT cosmos , in work he conducted regarding . Maxwell 's research predicted IN Saturn 's rings MD be made of lots of small , unconnected particles ; he turned out to be right . His math RB explains why EX are no NN - size disks floating around DT galaxy . To flatten NNP without spinning PRP very rapidly , PRP 'd need magic , or perhaps a galactic panini press . At any rate , a MD n't last for long . Within a few hours , DT force of gravity MD press DT NN back into a spheroid . Gravity pulls equally from all sides , which explains why planets are spheres ( or nearly so – depending on DT speed of a NN 's rotation , those forces MD work against gravity to create a bit of a bulge at DT equator ) . A stable , solid disk - IN NNP just is n’t possible under DT actual conditions of gravity , as Maxwell ’s math showed . And once PRP VBP rid of gravity , everything about our NN rapidly stops making sense . DT atmosphere ? Gone , because it's held to DT NN by gravity . Tides ? Gone . PRP 're caused by DT gravitational pull of DT moon , which tugs on DT oceans and causes them to subtly bulge out as PRP swings by . itself ? RB gone , since every explanation of DT moon 's existence involves gravity . In DT most widely accepted scenario , DT moon was created when a giant , NN - size body crashed into DT early NNP ; debris from DT crash was captured by NNP 's gravity . Another scenario suggests IN DT moon formed at DT same NN as NNP did ( again , thanks to gravity ) . Or , NNP 's formidable gravity attracted and snagged DT traveling hunk of space rock as PRP went hurtling by . Gravity is RB responsible for , with DT densest materials sinking to DT core , lighter materials making up DT mantle and DT lightest materials forming DT crust . Without this layered structure , DT NN MD behave a lot differently . NNP 's liquid outer core , for example , acts as a giant , dynamic magnet , which creates DT NN 's magnetic field . DT magnetic field helps protect DT NN 's atmosphere from DT stripping effect of DT solar wind , which scraped away Mars ' atmosphere after DT NN 's magnetic field faltered 4 billion NNS ago . If DT NNP were flat , plate tectonics — DT movement of rigid plates WDT make up DT NN 's crust — MD n't work either , says James Davis , a geophysicist at DT Columbia University Lamont - Doherty NNP Observatory in NNP York City . "" When PRP do DT calculations , just simple calculations IN , ' If this plate is moving this much and DT plate is moving RB much , ' PRP have to do PRP on a sphere , "" he told Live NNP . "" PRP do n't VB DT right answer [ DT answer WDT matches real - NN observations ] if PRP assume PRP 's a plane . "" Related : 8 Times Flat - Earthers Tried to Challenge NN ( and Failed ) Flat - Earthers spin different explanations for how all these observations MD be possible on a flat NN . DT problem , Davis says , is IN these explanations do n't have any basis in mathematics or physical reality . When Maxwell predicted in DT 1850s IN Saturn 's rings were made of lots of small particles , he did so by applying general knowledge of how gravity and rotational forces work . His essay on DT subject , in fact , was mostly mathematical equations . Flat - NNP theories do n't work DT way , Davis says . DT flat - NNP worldview RB involves cherry - picking different explanations for different phenomena . In real life , DT NNP and DT Moon are both round for DT same quantifiable reason — gravity . have to invent independent explanations for both , and these independent explanations often contradict CD another . This is n’t how scientific theory works , Davis says . "" If PRP can explain a thousand observations with CD theory , a simple theory , DT 's better than explaining a thousand observations with a thousand theories , "" he VBD . But setting all DT aside , if DT NNP were truly flat , PRP MD mean IN DT millions of NNS who deny its flatness — and who have done so throughout history — are VBN in a vast NN for reasons WDT are flat - out unfathomable . PRP almost makes DT prospect of a galactic panini press look realistic . • None How Do Flat - Earthers Explain DT Equinox ?

Results MD vary from lonely candy canes to full - blown holiday light dragons . But whether PRP VBP full - throttle or prefer a low - key display of holiday cheer , CD thing is now true : NASA is watching . NNS at DT Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and Yale University in Connecticut used satellite imagery to track light patterns in 1,200 cities over two and a half NNS . PRP found IN increased light correlated perfectly with DT holiday seasons for Ramadan in DT Middle East , as well as Christmas and NNP NNP 's Eve worldwide . PRP RB saw variations in how cities and neighborhoods within those cities celebrate these holidays , DT team announced this week at DT American Geophysical Union 's annual meeting in San Francisco . "" What ’s happening during DT holidays is our patterns are changing , "" says Miguel Román , a physical scientist at NASA Goddard . In DT West , PRP 're staying up late drinking eggnog and VBG home from work early . "" Those changes in behavior are changes in DT locations of demand for NN services . "" Understanding such seasonal shifts might ultimately tell PRP what 's driving carbon NNS at a local level . With hundreds of satellites circling NNP , PRP might seem easy to snap a picture of exactly what ’s down below . But getting really high resolution images has been difficult , especially when homing in on urban environments . In 2011 , DT Suomi-NPP satellite launched with a fancy schmancy camera aboard . This particular camera has low - light sensors WDT can pick up on wavelengths from green to infrared and create more intense images . DT camera allows Suomi-NPP to take pictures of NNP at around 1 am local NN every night at very high resolution . “ PRP ’s extremely sensitive . Allowing every single pixel to be overexposed , PRP can pick DT faintest signal IN a fishing boat out of DT coast of Somalia , as well as very bright signals IN volcanic magma on DT Big Island of Hawaii , ” explains Román . In 2012 , NOAA used DT camera to make a composite image of a few months worth of lights at night . To make an image IN DT , PRP have to run DT raw data through special algorithms , to correct for white noise such as fires , reflective aerosols and moonlight . NASA wanted to be able to do this on a daily basis , so Román started exploring options . To VB a baseline , he looked at rural areas with little light pollution and at deserts . But when he took some initial data for Egypt and DT Sahara , something looked weird , as if DT lights were overly saturated . “ This was happening in urban areas , so PRP looked into DT , and what PRP realized was IN what PRP were seeing was IN DT increase in DT signal was timing perfectly with DT Ramadan calendar , ” recalls Román . He emailed urbanization specialists at Yale , and PRP were intrigued . Sure enough , PRP found DT same spike DT next NN . Over DT next two and half NNS , DT team measured data for three holiday periods : three NNS of Ramadan in DT summer ( in this case ) and two NNS of Christmas plus NNP NNPS from DT week of Thanksgiving to DT first week in January . Running DT images through a specially designed algorithm , PRP compared DT light signal during these periods to DT rest of DT NN in three geographic areas : DT Middle East , North America and DT Caribbean . Snow turned out to be a big problem . Looking at DT first round of Christmas data from DT central U.S. , Román saw a huge spike in Denver in 2012 . But PRP was n't just Christmas lights , PRP was lamp light reflecting off fresh snow , so PRP had to take out most cities north of St. Louis . Still , PRP were able to pick up on some general trends , and produced maps for DT holiday periods . In 70 cities across DT U.S. , lights twinkled brighter during Christmas and NNP NNP 's , regardless of JJ or other factors . "" [ PRP 's ] tracking this national shared tradition , "" says Román . City suburbs in particular showed a 30 to 50 percent increase in lighting intensity , while most urban centers saw a 20 to 30 percent increase . DT 's likely because a bigger yard means more space for blow - up Santas and glow - in - DT - dark reindeer . In Román 's native Puerto Rico , DT Christmas pattern emerged as well . Using their algorithm , DT researchers were actually able to group together cultural centers of holiday festivals , industrial cities and more rural towns based on DT citizens ' NN habits . "" [ PRP ] are now able to classify cities as a function of DT NN behaviors of its inhabitants . Behaviors WDT are based on DT norms , on DT identities of a culture , "" explains Román . "" This is way cooler than seeing Christmas lights from space . "" In DT Middle East , DT lights of major cities burned brighter during DT holy month of Ramadan , typically culminating with a peak associated with Eid festivities . Generally , lights increased in DT city center with group prayer activities at night and NNS VBG to work earlier . Differences across NNS stood out . Saudi Arabia had DT most intense Ramadan increase , while DT lights of Istanbul were a little weaker . Saudi Arabia is more conservative , while Turkey is more secular . "" Nighttime lights really track DT cultural differences between these cities and DT NNS WDT host them , "" says Eleanor Stokes , a graduate student at Yale who collaborated on DT NN . Tel Aviv , notably , had no increase in lighting during DT Muslim holy month . And cities in Iraq and Lebanon saw dips in nightime lights , which DT researchers link to unreliable electricity . In Syria , decreases in nighttime light in Aleppo and Damascus likely corresponded to political and military unrest . "" These nighttime lights really are in some ways IN DT EKG of a city , "" says Stokes . In Egypt , DT researchers took a closer look at 20 Cairo neighborhoods and found IN poorer areas saw a smaller peak during Ramadan , choosing to leave DT lights off for financial or maybe cultural reasons . "" PRP can see those social and cultural imprints in DT NN signatures themselves , "" says Stokes . DT data do n’t give them an exact measure of DT total NN use on a city block , but DT lights do provide a proxy for tracking NN use patterns . “ This is DT factor WDT ’s most sensitive to human behavior . When NNS turn on DT lights , DT next thing PRP ’re VBG to turn on is DT toaster and DT heater , ” says Román . “ PRP ’s those patterns of behavior WDT PRP ’re trying to see . ” Urban areas account for a huge chunk of NN use and NNS , so DT researchers hope to overlay DT data with carbon NNS and NN consumption data in DT future . "" Carbon dioxide NNS is giving PRP DT when , where and DT how much . But PRP ’s not telling PRP what is driving PRP , "" says Román . Looking at DT lighting data against NNS MD help build more localized NN mitigation strategies . Román points out : "" What 's VBG to work in NNP York City is n't necessarily VBG to work for Amarillo , Texas . "" In this way , DT images provide a lot more than pretty pictures of NNP from space .

Professor Hawking believes IN humans must colonize other worlds within DT next 100 NNS in order to survive several threats WDT our species faces ; NN NN , asteroid strikes and even overpopulation and perhaps DT most worrisome of all , nuclear strikes . According to DT Telegraph , BBC ’s series RB aims to discover Britain ’s greatest inventor and has asked DT NN to VOTE on DT innovation which has been DT most influential in their lives . Professor Hawking has actively spoken out in DT last couple of NNS about DT threats WDT mankind faces . From DT dangers of Artificial Intelligence , biological warfare , to DT threats from outer space , Professor Hawking VBD IN only a “ NN NN ” MD prevent impending doom . Mr. Hawking previously commented IN humans MD lack DT skills as a species to stay alive . “ I do n’t VB PRP will survive another 1,000 NNS without escaping our fragile NN , ” he had VBN , adding : “ I therefore VBP to encourage JJ interest in space , and I have been getting my training in early . ” According to DT NNP ’s smartest man , our NN is headed towards disaster . “ Although DT chance of a disaster to NN NNP in a given NN MD be quite low , PRP adds up over NN , and becomes a near certainty in DT next thousand or ten thousand NNS , ” he VBD . “ However , PRP will not establish self - sustaining colonies in space for at least DT next hundred NNS , so PRP have to be very careful in this period . ” Last NN Professor Hawking made quite a few predictions and VBD IN chances of an apocalyptic even on NNP are a near certainty . “ Although DT chance of disaster to NN NNP in a given NN MD be quite low , PRP adds up over NN , and becomes a near certainty in DT next 1,000 or 10,000 NNS , ” Hawking told DT Oxford University Union in November . “ By DT NN , PRP should have spread out into space and to other stars , so a disaster on NNP MD not mean DT end of DT human race . ” However , if PRP are to leave NNP as Professor Hawking suggests , where should PRP VB ? Who do PRP save ? Who gets to VB to a brand JJ NN ? Who will take PRP RB and who will pay for PRP all ? Too JJ questions WDT can be solved in a period of 100 NNS , do n’t PRP VB ?

DT ’s because her act invariably mirrors whatever agenda needs to be pushed by mass NN at DT particular moment . Indeed , Miley never had her own sound , her own image or her own message . Her entire act was always dictated by her handlers ever since she was a child playing DT role of Hannah Montana . Appropriately enough , Miley recently appeared in an episode of Black Mirror where she played DT role of a mind - controlled pop star who has absolutely no control over her career and her message . While her character ( named Ashley O ) keeps talking about “ empowerment ” to her fans , she ’s actually a heavily medicated slave who does as she ’s told by her handlers . Only a few weeks after DT release of DT Black Mirror episode , Miley Cyrus unleashes upon DT NN Mother ’s Daughter – an NSFW music video loaded with a bunch of calculated messages aimed a young NNS . Indeed , DT video is essentially an infomercial sponsored by powerful groups , lobbies , and VB tanks to propagate specific social messages . According to NN sources , Mother ’s Daughter is “ a statement made in support of gender equality , freedom and DT fight against discrimination and sexual harassment ” . Of course , DT video was immediately praised by everyone in show business because DT ’s DT agenda right now and nobody can oppose PRP . Abortions good . Genders bad . However , EX is more to this video than meets DT eye . Let ’s look at PRP . DT concept of DT video is rather simple : Lots of guest appearances by activists and other NNS WDT support a specific agenda . At DT center of PRP all : Miley Cyrus wearing a red latex suit which features a symbolic “ accessory ” . Beyond DT folk tales , DT dentata aptly represents an important aspect of today ’s mass NN agenda : DT weaponization of feminity . PRP is about using “ feminism ” ( a distorted version of PRP ) for social engineering . PRP is about turning DT female body ( with all of its warm , receptive and nurturing qualities ) against its own nature . PRP is about radicalizing sexes and breeding hatred between males and females . PRP is about turning DT sad reality of abortion into some kind of feminist power move . Throughout DT video , lots of messages are flashed on screen . PRP all have a strange , Orwellian quality to them . A riot is “ a form of civil disorder commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent JJ disturbance against authority , property or NNS . ” Is every woman truly a riot ? Of course not . Some women are warm , gentle and loving NNS who do not feel DT need to be angry at everything . By trying to be “ feminists ” , these NNS actually reduce and generalize women to fit their own contrived vision . This next message is worse . DT message is followed by a shot of a young girl . So , let ’s unpack “ virginity is a social construct ” . What does DT even mean ? As seen in past articles such as A Teen Vogue Video Says : “ This Idea WDT DT Body Is Either Male or Female is Totally Wrong ” , EX is a worrying trend in mass NN WDT urges young NNS to deny verifiable facts to embrace a radical and extreme social agenda . Here ’s an excerpt from an article justifying this line of thinking : DT fact IN DT video follows “ virginity does n’t exist ” with a young girl is weird . Do PRP believe IN NNS are not virgins ? DT video then continues with more strange imagery . DT next message in DT video gets spiritual . DT lyrics of DT song kind VBP in DT same pseudo - satanic direction as DT message above . DT first verse goes as follows : As PRP might VB , hallelujah means “ Praise DT Lord ” and is theologically DT highest form of praise PRP can give to God . Combining this word with “ I ’m a freak ” and “ I ’ma do ya ” is basically a form of disrespect and blasphemy . In DT second verse , PRP start to understand what kind of psychopath MD dream up these kinds of debasing messages . As seen in my article DT Sick , Twisted Messages in “ Chilling Adventures of Sabrina ” , EX ’s a clear and evident mass NN push to associate witches with feminism . Throughout DT video , this chorus is repeated ad - nauseam : Miley says IN she ’s nasty and evil because EX ’s “ something in DT NN ” . DT ’s an interesting NN theory . Her other theory is IN she ’s nasty and evil because she ’s IN her mother . Now DT ’s an uplifting message for DT youth . Speaking of witch ( not a typo ) , Miley ’s mother Tish Cyrus makes an appearance in DT video . DT video RB features other “ guests ” . Is this video celebrating “ diversity ” or exploiting PRP ? As stated countless times in previous articles , everyone has DT absolute right to live in whatever way WDT makes them happy and comfortable . But EX ’s a fine line between accepting NNS and hunting down DT most “ diverse ” NNS and exploiting them in videos as if PRP were circus freaks for maximum virtue signaling points . Here ’s what probably happened behind DT scenes : While clamoring “ inclusivity ” , videos IN this NN actually reduces NNS to attributes such as “ trans ” or “ disabled ” . This final image sums up DT entire video . Does this image convey power ? Or DT exact opposite ? Miley sits on a carousel horse WDT is meant to VB around in circles . She wears fake studio props as an armor . Miley is not leading anyone anywhere . She ’s a highly controlled pop star in a studio who is taking orders from a director ( who is a white male , by DT way ) . DT chorus might say “ Do n’t f*ck with my freedom ” . However , those who own her never gave her any of PRP . Mother ’s Daughter is not art . PRP is propaganda and indoctrination . In only a few short minutes , this video manages to mix DT occult elite ’s obsession with abortions , gender - blurring , and satanism . Let ’s not forget DT fact IN PRP believe IN virginity is a “ social construct ” . In DT end , behind all of DT virtue signaling and DT buzzwords , this video actually celebrates only CD thing : DT corruption of everything WDT is pure and sacred . P.S.

Better still was DT timing . Ilves ended up in DT Oval Office on 25 June , exactly CD week before NNP NNP George W. Bush MD host Vladimir Putin in Kennebunkport , Maine . DT symbolism – Estonia first , Russia second – was not overlooked in DT Baltic NN . As Ilves VBD to Estonians , DT invitation proved IN membership of NATO and DT EU was not just a series of empty obligations and formalities . “ If PRP help others , then PRP will help PRP , ” Ilves VBD . True enough , but PRP is difficult to imagine IN DT White House MD have acted similarly had Ilves ’s predecessor , Arnold Rüütel , aged 78 , still been NN . Rüütel , a stodgy ex-communist who brought precious few ideas to DT job , never had DT erudition and aplomb WDT Ilves possesses in abundance . Ilves and Bush first met in November 2006 , just a month - and - a - half after Ilves ( DT name means ‘ lynx ’ in Estonian ) was inaugurated , during DT NNP NN ’s stopover in Tallinn en route to DT NATO summit in Riga , Latvia . Judging by all accounts , DT man from Texas took an instant liking to DT man who was a teenage immigrant to NNP Jersey . So come April , when Estonia erupted in two nights of rioting WDT left CD dead and more than a hundred wounded and caused extensive property damage , Bush remembered his JJ friend in DT Baltics . And how MD he not ? DT loquacious Ilves , who , as well as English , RB has a command of German and Spanish , always leaves a favourable impression . Listening to him is a treat . He wields a wonderful mix of intellectual insights and down - to - NN wisdom seldom found in JJ officials . Speaking on Ukraine ’s incessant woes , for instance , he is quick to point out IN DT crucial mistake was made in DT early 1990s by DT then NN Leonid Kravchuk when DT latter refused to co-operate with a diaspora of three million Ukrainians living in North America . By shutting DT door on such potential expertise and investment , Kravchuk all but slammed DT door to possible Western integration in his own face . Ilves MD VB . A son of Estonian refugees , he was born in Stockholm in 1953 . When he was thirteen his family moved to DT NNP , where Toomas Hendrik ( he always uses both first and middle names ) later graduated from Columbia University ( BA ) and DT University of Pennsylvania ( MA ) with degrees in psychology . In 1984 he packed his bags and left for Munich to work as an analyst with Radio Free Europe , and nine NNS later he returned stateside – only this NN as ambassador to NNP NNPS , Canada and Mexico for a newly independent Estonia . Of his own background , Ilves has VBN : “ I speak English IN an American , I VBP IN a European . ” Remarkably , as a member of DT European Parliament from April 2004 to September 2006 he was tireless in using these two sides of his persona to bridge DT transatlantic rift after DT invasion of Iraq . He blasted Donald Rumsfeld ’s ‘ Old Europe ’ paradigm as a “ disaster , ” and when German philosopher Jürgen Habermas and DT late French deconstructionist Jacques Derrida published a joint declaration calling on Europeans to unite under a banner of anti-Americanism , Ilves wrote a lengthy , passionate rebuttal . Recalling DT heady NN of 2003 , he VBD , “ EX was too much hysteria on both sides of DT Atlantic . ” Ilves eventually gave up his NNP citizenship to become Estonia ’s foreign minister in 1996 . In more than a decade of domestic Estonian politics , he has stood steadfastly in DT centre of DT political spectrum as a member of DT Moderates , a party WDT he helped create . Thanks to Ilves ’s friendship with Mart Laar , a former prime minister , Estonia was DT first European nation to introduce DT flat tax . In 2004 DT Moderates became DT Social Democratic Party , which Ilves left after becoming NN . A striking trait of Ilves is his versatility . He loves DT rustic life and enjoys sporting a pair of overalls and tilling DT soil at his farmstead in Arma , just a short walk from DT Latvian - Estonian border . Film is another favorite pastime . Recently he even tried his talents at acting , taking a cameo role in ‘ 186 Kilometers ’ an Estonian picture about an out - of - luck actor who runs into sundry difficulties trying to make what should be a simple journey from Tallinn to Tartu , a university town southeast of DT capital . In CD of Ilves ’s charity drives , a few NNS ago he was asked to help raise money for disabled NNS by participating in a benefit concert . Ilves agreed and put on a small performance reminiscent of DT Blues Brothers , VBG so far as to don DT black fedora and sunglasses . During DT European Parliament ballot in 2004 , however , his political opponents from Res Publica , a right - wing startup , used this image of Ilves on its posters to scare DT Estonian electorate into believing IN DT Chicago mob was threatening to overrun DT Baltic NN . DT NN campaign , which Ilves slammed as “ vicious ” and “ slimy , ” backfired , and DT Social Democrats won DT most votes , walking away with three of Estonia ’s six seats in DT EU legislature . DT ‘ mobster ’ himself was appointed deputy chairman of DT foreign affairs committee . Two - and - a- half NNS later , Ilves , who actually prefers bow - ties , was further vindicated when Res Publica , which bitterly opposed a second presidential term for Rüütel , threw its support behind his candidacy . For now , Ilves , who will celebrate his first NN in office on 9 October , faces tremendous domestic challenges . After DT Soviet memorial debacle in April , Estonian society is deeply split – CD - quarter of DT country ’s 1.3 million are ethnic Russians . Given DT current labour deficit , keeping DT Russians – JJ of whom are non-citizens without DT right to vote in national elections – is a matter of JJ urgency . Tellingly , Ilves ’s first domestic trip after becoming NN was to Narva and Ida - Virumaa , towns in northeastern Estonia WDT are more than 90 % ethnic Russian . DT appeal is RB directed at Estonians . Demographics , after all , will be DT country ’s single greatest challenge in DT 21st century . While in NNP York in September , Ilves appealed to Estonians living in DT NNP to VB about returning to DT Baltics . “ PRP need every Estonian , ” he VBD . 1998 - 2004 : Minister of foreign affairs and member of parliament in Estonia 2006 : NNP of DT Republic of Estonia"

PRP ticks by , moment by moment , day after day . But PRP ’s so baked into our lives IN PRP do n’t VB much about PRP , unless PRP ’re late for an appointment or suddenly notice those gray hairs in DT mirror . Then DT physicists weigh in , and NN suddenly seems more complicated . Einstein tells PRP IN PRP can expand and shrink , while DT second law of thermodynamics , which says IN DT universe is growing more disordered , seems somehow to be tied to NN ’s “ flow . ” Carlo Rovelli has devoted most of his career to pondering DT enigma of NN . An Italian physicist working at Aix - Marseille University in France , Rovelli is known among NNS for his pioneering work on loop quantum gravity — a theory WDT attempts to unite quantum mechanics with Einstein ’s theory of general relativity . DT wider NN , meanwhile , has come to VB him as an eloquent , even poetic writer on scientific topics . Rovelli ’s 2014 book , "" Seven Brief Lessons on Physics , "" sold more than a million copies around DT NN . Now he ’s out with a JJ book , "" DT Order of NNP , "" which zeroes in on DT most peculiar dimension : NN . Recently , MACH spoke with Rovelli about DT nature of NN , whether PRP has a beginning and if humans might CD day master NN travel . DT interview has been edited for length and clarity . MACH : What exactly is NN ? Rovelli : PRP is something very complex . PRP mistakenly VBP IN NN is something basic , something very elementary . PRP imagine PRP ticking away DT life of DT cosmos , in a succession of instants . This understanding of NN is wrong . Or at least , PRP ’s an approximation of a far more complex reality . This does n’t mean IN DT layperson ’s understanding of NN is an illusion . PRP only means IN PRP holds up in a limited way . PRP ’s IN thinking IN DT NNP is flat . As long as PRP move in a small region [ on DT NNP ’s surface ] , PRP can very well consider PRP to be flat . When PRP build a house , for example , PRP do n’t need to bother with DT curvature of DT surface of DT NNP . But if PRP look at a larger scale , then definitely DT NNP is not flat . PRP ’s DT same with NN . Our everyday intuition of PRP works very well , but only as long as PRP do n’t look too far out into space or too deeply into small distances , and only if PRP do n’t consider things moving at high speeds . What does physics have to say about DT “ flow ” of NN WDT humans seem to feel ? PRP MD not be a physics problem . I VBP PRP depends on our brains and DT complicated way in which PRP form memories . PRP has to do with how PRP remember DT past and anticipate DT future . So to explain this passage of NN , this flowing of NN , I believe PRP should look at neuroscience , not physics . What do physicists see as DT biggest unanswered question about NN ? DT biggest of DT open questions is : Why is DT future so different from DT past ? This is something WDT is not written into DT laws of physics — DT fundamental laws of physics do n’t distinguish DT past from DT future . This is still something mysterious , I believe . Where does DT second law of thermodynamics fit in ? VB of a film of CD billiard ball hitting another . DT film looks DT same forward as backward . PRP ’s DT same with DT moon orbiting DT NNP , or DT NNP VBG around DT sun . But this NN - symmetry breaks down with complex systems , where PRP can see DT amount of disorder increasing . IN a teacup breaking , or an egg getting scrambled ? Right . This increase in disorder is DT second law of thermodynamics . DT mysterious part is not so much IN things VBP disordered ; of course , things VBP disordered . DT mysterious part is , why were PRP ordered in DT past ? Who ordered them in DT past ? How far into DT past should PRP look for an answer ? PRP ’re pretty confident IN DT universe started off with DT Big Bang . PRP do n’t VB what happened just before ; DT ’s still very much debated . PRP VBP IN things have been getting more and more disordered since DT Big Bang . DT whole 14 - billion - NN history of DT universe has been IN a deck of cards WDT ’s been shuffled over and over again , always becoming more disordered . But PRP ’s a puzzle , because DT Big Bang — this initial , compressed , hot phase of DT universe — does n’t seem to have been very ordered . Yet somehow PRP must have been . So what was DT source of this initial order ? DT is still an open question . PRP do n’t VB . For a while , PRP seemed reasonable to VB DT NN “ began ” 13.8 billion NNS ago , with DT Big Bang . But today JJ NNS are doubting this idea and considering DT possibility IN DT universe existed before DT Big Bang . All options are open . MD NN travel ever be possible ? Well , “ NN traveling ” is what PRP do all our lives , is n’t PRP ? But PRP mean , can PRP jump quickly to DT past or to DT future . Jumping to DT far future is certainly possible . PRP ’s only a technological problem , not a scientific NN . CD way is to move very fast . When PRP move fast , NN passes very slowly for PRP — so if PRP MD run fast enough around your house JJ times , PRP MD do DT in a NN span which for PRP is a couple of minutes , but in DT meanwhile centuries pass for everyone else . DT only difficulty is IN DT speed needed for this has to be very high , comparable to DT speed of light . Another way to jump to DT future is to travel near a black hole . Near a black hole , NN slows down . So a starship MD wait RB for half an hour and then move away from DT black hole , and find itself millennia in DT future . What about traveling back in NN ? DT ’s much more complicated . PRP is not logically impossible , but PRP requires beating DT second law of thermodynamics , which MD be IN beating DT laws of probability . I VBP IN if PRP ever achieve this , PRP MD be long after PRP ’ve mastered forward NN travel . Has working as a physicist affected DT way PRP VBP about NN in your own life ? I ’ve certainly changed a lot , in my way of thinking , over DT NNS . But I ’m not sure if PRP ’s because of my research or because I ’m getting older . I ’m much more relaxed . I ’m much more serene , less rushed . I VBP of life more as a gift . But possibly PRP ’s just because I was 20 before , and I ’m 60 now . Life looks different from this perspective . • Tiny ' dumbbells ' WDT spin 60 billion times a minute MD help solve quantum mysteries • Physicist Brian Greene on DT three biggest NN mysteries he'd VB to see solved"

' Tis DT season for holiday parties at DT office . While PRP 're great for building workplace camaraderie and team spirit , when was DT last NN a colleague — perhaps fueled by too much alcohol — VBD something so ridiculous IN PRP made your jaw drop ? Perhaps a desk mate went into something political , claiming IN George Bush is behind 9/11 or IN Barack Obama is a Muslim from Kenya ? Or maybe your boss voiced NN denialism , arguing IN DT NNP is flat or DT Apollo moon landing was faked ? Just as disconcerting as DT NN theorist in your midst is hearing a boss or colleague blatantly deny a business reality , such as evidence IN a favored product flopped or a decision was absolutely DT wrong NN . So what do PRP do when someone PRP work with — even DT CEO of DT company — tells PRP something WDT 's demonstrably false ? Dealing with truth denialism — in business , politics and other life areas — is CD of my areas of research , and I recently published a book on DT topic . Here are some tips to navigate DT Christmas office party or CD - on - CD with a boss in denial . PRP begins at DT top DT worst - case scenario is when your chief executive is DT NN in denial . A four - NN NN by LeadershipIQ.com , which provides online leadership seminars , interviewed 1,087 board members from 286 organizations of all sorts WDT forced out their chief executive officers . PRP found IN almost CD quarter of CEOs — 23 percent — got fired for denying reality , meaning refusing to recognize negative facts about DT organization 's performance . Other research strongly suggests IN DT behaviors expressed by CEOs "" are felt throughout DT organization by impacting DT norms WDT sanction or discourage member behavior and decision making , and DT patterns of behavior and interaction among members . "" Together , these findings suggest IN organizations where CEOs deny negative facts will have a culture of denying reality throughout DT hierarchy . Of course , even when DT boss lives in DT real NN , others in DT organization MD hold false beliefs . Professionals at all levels can suffer from DT tendency to deny uncomfortable facts in business settings . Scholars term this thinking error DT ostrich effect , named after DT ( mythical ) notion IN ostriches stick their heads into DT sand when PRP see threats . Our intuition is to confront colleagues suffering from DT ostrich effect with DT facts . But research — and common sense , if DT colleague is your supervisor — suggests DT 's usually DT wrong thing to do . DT 's because when someone believes something PRP VBP to be false , some kind of emotional block is probably at play . A number of factors explain why this happens . For example , research on confirmation bias shows IN PRP tend to look for and interpret information in ways WDT conforms to our beliefs . So even if sales are far below expectations , a CEO might reject DT information in projecting good financial forecasts on DT belief IN his actions should lead DT company to do well . In another example at a company where I consulted , a manager refused to acknowledge IN a person hired directly by her was a bad fit , despite everyone else in DT department telling me IN DT employee was holding back DT team . DT manager 's behavior likely resulted from what scholars term DT sunk cost fallacy , a tendency to double down on past decisions even when an objective assessment shows DT decision to be problematic . In both NNS , facing facts MD cause DT CEO or DT manager to feel bad . PRP often prefer to stick our heads into DT sand rather than acknowledge our fault because of our reluctance to experience negative emotions . Research on a phenomenon called DT backfire effect shows PRP tend to dig in our heels when PRP are presented with facts WDT cause PRP to feel bad about our identity , self - worth , worldview or group belonging . In some NNS , presenting DT facts actually backfires , causing NNS to develop a stronger attachment to incorrect beliefs . Moreover , PRP express anger at DT person bringing PRP DT message , a phenomenon researchers term "" shoot DT messenger . "" EX are JJ other mental errors WDT inhibit business professionals from seeing reality clearly and making good decisions . This is n't to say IN emotions are DT problem . PRP are not . Emotions are fundamentally important to DT human experience , and PRP need both reason and emotion to make good decisions . So rather than offering facts , your goal should be to show emotional leadership and try to figure out what are DT emotional blocks inhibiting your colleague from seeing reality clearly . To do so , use curiosity and subtle questioning to figure out their values and goals and how PRP shape their perception of self - identity . And focus on deploying DT emotional intelligence skill of empathy . Unfortunately , despite extensive research about DT importance of emotional intelligence in professional settings , too JJ organizations still fail to provide such training . Once PRP understand your colleague 's goals and values , try to show PRP share them . Research shows doing so is crucial to conveying knowledge effectively in professional environments . Practice mirroring , or rephrasing in your own words DT points made by DT other person , which demonstrates PRP understand how PRP feel and helps build trust . With a CEO , PRP might talk about how both of PRP share a desire for DT executive to be a truly strong leader . Try to connect DT traits and emotions identified by DT CEO to specific examples of his behavior . And regarding DT manager with DT problematic employee , I had a conversation about how she saw her current and potential future employees playing a role in DT long - term future of DT department she ran . I echoed her anxiety about DT company 's financial performance and concerns about getting funding for future hires , which gave me an additional clue into why she might be protecting DT incompetent employee . After placing yourself on DT same side , building up trust and establishing an emotional connection , move on to DT problem at hand : their emotional block . DT key here is to show them , without arousing a defensive or aggressive response , how their current truth denialism undermines their own goals in DT long term . PRP can help to cite a prominent example of a business leader accepting difficult facts to move forward , such as how former Ford CEO Alan Mulally helped save DT company through repeated course corrections .

Although simplified to run a large number of simulated NNS per day , PRP is a complex NN model WDT solves NN - dependent equations describing DT fluid and thermodynamics of DT system . FOAM is a coupled general circulation model , meaning IN PRP uses different circulation models for various aspects of DT simulation . DT Community NNP Model CCM3 is used to simulate DT atmospheric components of DT NN , whereas DT Modular Ocean Model OM3 is used to simulate DT dynamics of DT ocean . DT two components are coupled , meaning IN DT transfer of heat and moisture at DT boundary is calculated , as well as DT distribution of any NN NN . Although DT dynamics of DT NN NN is not included in FOAM , other studies have examined how DT inclusion of sea-ice dynamics changes DT ability of a model to initiate Snowball Earth33,34,35 . In particular , when polar NN caps become large , PRP flow under DT influence of gravity , facilitating DT advance of DT NN front equatorward . This result means IN Snowball - NNP conditions MD onset at a lower value of methane concentration for models with sea-ice dynamics than for those without . In our simulations , which are heavily abstracted , this effect does not VB DT qualitative conclusion IN DT topography of DT NNP ( or more specifically , DT albedo ) affects DT onset of Snowball NNP . FOAM splits DT atmosphere into 18 vertical levels , each with a depth in units of pressure of 55 hPa . DT atmosphere has 40 latitudinal and 48 longitudinal grid points . DT ocean model has a higher resolution , with 128 latitudinal and longitudinal grid points with a maximum of 20 vertical levels depending on DT chosen ocean depth . These levels are not equally spaced , with DT first 14 levels making up DT top 1500 m of DT ocean . For simplicity , DT ocean depth is set to a constant value of 3100 m , CD of DT fixed depths available in DT ocean model . This depth is similar to DT average ocean depth on present - day NNP . DT flat continent had a constant elevation of 20 m above NN level . DT area of DT oceans and continents does not VB when NN from DT oceans is removed to form NN sheets on land . DT depth of DT continental NN sheets does not affect DT continental topography . For simplicity , our simulations share DT same orbital characteristics ( i.e. , orbital rotation rate , eccentricity , obliquity , date of perihelion ) as DT present day , with DT exception of a 360 - day NN . DT solar constant is set to DT predicted solar luminosity 2.4 billion NNS ago of 1100 W m−2 , CD % lower than DT present - day value8 . To compensate for this lower solar constant , DT concentration of greenhouse gases in DT atmosphere was higher than DT present - day values10 . Greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane have been hypothesised to have created a strong greenhouse effect on early NNP . This experiment assumes IN carbon dioxide is DT largest contributor to this NN . CD possible range of carbon dioxide concentrations during DT Proterozoic is 4000 to 80,000 ppmv38 . A value of 10,000 ppmv is chosen , a number within this range and RB used in another NN 17 . DT range of atmospheric methane concentration to test over was decided based on estimates10 and DT results of modelling17 . This range is 1 –100 ppmv . DT size and location of DT continents 2.4 billion NNS ago is uncertain . CD plausible reconstruction places a supercontinent close to DT equator , with a larger meridional dimension than zonal one25 . Another constructed simulation from DT PaleoProterozoic glaciation used a similar series of continents 17 . A box containing DT entire supercontinent occupies about 15 % of NNP ’s total surface area . To replicate this , a rectangular continent ( on a latitude– longitude map projection ) centred on DT equator WDT is 15.6 % of DT total surface area is used in this experiment . This continent extends from 56 °N to 56°S , and has a west–east width of 68° longitude . DT continent surface type is set to desert rock , which has an albedo of 24%39 , replicating DT plant - less continent surface of 2.4 billion NNS ago . DT elevation of DT continent is 20 m above NN level . Little information is available about DT topography of this supercontinent , and so PRP experiment with a number of hypothetical sets of mountain ranges at various latitudes ( Fig. 1 ) . PRP are all placed parallel to latitude lines , and DT pairs are placed DT same distance from DT equator in each hemisphere . DT mountains are approximately Gaussian in profile , have a latitudinal width of 10 grid points , which is equivalent to about 1550 m ( 14° latitude ) at DT equator , and each mountain spans DT entire longitudinal dimension of DT continent . DT mountain dimensions are restricted by DT 128 × 128 grid boxes , which limits how gradual DT slope of DT mountains can be , but PRP have a maximum height of 3000 m . A suite of model simulations varying DT maximum height of DT mountains using DT M40 and M50 configurations showed no sensitivity to DT onset of DT Snowball NNP for mountain heights between 0.5 and 3.0 km . Such results are consistent with those where PRP vary DT albedo of flat terrain at low latitudes and show IN DT effect of DT albedo on NN is greater than DT effect of DT terrain on NN . DT simulations are performed in a NN - slice experiment where DT model is initialised and then run until PRP reaches equilibrium . Each simulation is initialised with DT conditions of DT present NN . DT polar surface temperature is set to 10 °C and DT equatorial temperature to 28 °C . DT conditions being tested cannot maintain such a high surface temperature , and so DT system evolves to a JJ , colder NN . DT NN WDT DT system ends up in primarily depends on DT tested value of methane . Simulations are run for a total of 400 NNS to give DT NN enough NN to evolve to its JJ NN . But , this NN is not sufficient to produce NN sheets of substantial depth to rival DT height of DT mountain range or reach DT stage where DT NN MD flow a substantial distance due to gravity ( which MD not be modeled in FOAM anyway ) . Thirty - day mean values are output from DT model 12 times each model NN . These data describe DT monthly - mean NN of DT atmosphere , ocean , and cryosphere ( NN and snow ) for DT NN . In addition to DT 49 simulations performed in DT NN , 40 other simulations were performed with a continent comprising 27 % of DT area of DT NNP ( comparable to modern values ) , solar constant of 1142 W m−2 and a carbon dioxide concentration of 2000 ppm . Methane was varied from 100 , 200 , 400 , 600 , 800 , 1000 , 2400 , and 2600 ppm . These simulations show a similar sensitivity to DT presented in DT present article ."

""_''","NNP 's first moon rover has touched DT lunar surface and left deep traces on its loose soil , NN NN reported on Sunday , several hours after DT country successfully carried out DT NN 's first soft landing of a space probe on DT moon in nearly four decades . DT 140 - kilogram ( 300 - pound ) "" Jade Rabbit "" rover separated from DT much larger landing vehicle early Sunday , around seven hours after DT unmanned Chang'e 3 space probe touched down on a fairly flat , NNP - facing part of DT moon . NN broadcaster NNP Central Television showed images taken from DT lander 's camera of DT rover and its shadow moving down a sloping ladder and touching DT surface , setting off applause in DT Beijing control center . PRP VBD DT lander and rover , both bearing Chinese flags , MD take photos of each other on Sunday evening . Later , DT six - wheeled rover will survey DT moon 's geological structure and surface and look for natural resources for three months , while DT lander will carry out scientific explorations at DT landing site for CD NN . DT mission marks DT next stage in an ambitious space program WDT aims to eventually put a Chinese astronaut on DT moon . NNP 's space program is an enormous source of pride for DT country , DT third to carry out a lunar soft landing - which does not damage DT craft and DT equipment PRP carries - after DT NNP NNPS and DT former Soviet Union . DT last NN was by DT Soviet Union in 1976 . "" PRP 's still a significant technological challenge to land on another NN , "" VBD Peter Bond , consultant editor for Jane 's Space Systems and Industry . "" Especially somewhere IN DT moon , which does n't have an atmosphere so PRP can't use parachutes or anything IN DT . PRP have to use rocket motors for DT descent and PRP have to make sure PRP VBP down at DT right angle and DT right rate of descent and PRP do n't end up in a crater on top of a large rock . "" On Saturday evening , CCTV showed a computer - generated image of DT Chang'e 3 lander 's path as PRP approached DT surface of DT moon , saying IN during DT landing period PRP needed to have no contact with NNP . As PRP was just hundreds of meters ( yards ) away , DT lander 's camera broadcast images of DT moon 's surface . DT Chang'e 3's solar panels , which are used to absorb sunlight to generate power , opened soon after DT landing . DT mission blasted off from southwest NNP on Dec. 2 on a Long March - 3B carrier rocket . PRP is named after a mythical Chinese goddess of DT moon and DT "" Yutu "" rover , or "" Jade Rabbit "" in English , is DT goddess ' pet . NNP 's military - backed space program has made methodical progress in a relatively short NN , although PRP lags far behind DT NNP NNPS and Russia in technology and experience . NNP sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 , becoming DT third nation after Russia and DT NNP NNPS to achieve manned space travel independently . In 2006 , PRP sent its first probe to DT moon . NNP plans to open a space station around 2020 and send an astronaut to DT moon after DT . "" PRP are taking their NN with getting to VB about how to fly humans into space , how to build space stations ... how to explore DT solar system , especially DT moon and Mars , "" Bond VBD . "" PRP are making good strides , and I VBP over DT next 10 - 20 NNS PRP 'll certainly be rivaling Russia and America in this area and maybe overtaking them in some areas . """

An updated version by Live NNP staff was republished on NNP 30 , 2017 . Members of DT Flat NNP Society claim to believe DT NNP is flat . Walking around on DT NN 's surface , PRP looks and feels flat , so PRP deem all evidence to DT contrary , such as satellite photos of NNP as a sphere , to be fabrications of a "" round NNP NN "" orchestrated by NASA and other NN agencies . DT belief IN DT NNP is flat has been described as DT ultimate NN theory . According to DT Flat NNP Society 's leadership , its ranks have grown by 200 NNS ( mostly Americans and Britons ) per NN since 2009 . Judging by DT exhaustive effort flat - earthers have invested in fleshing out DT theory on their website , as well as DT staunch defenses of their views PRP offer in NN interviews and on Twitter , PRP MD seem IN these NNS genuinely believe DT NNP is flat . But in DT 21st century , can PRP be serious ? And if so , how is this psychologically possible ? First , a brief tour of DT worldview of a flat - earther : While writing off buckets of concrete evidence IN NNP is spherical , PRP readily accept a laundry list of propositions WDT some MD call ludicrous . DT leading flat - earther theory holds IN NNP is a disc with DT Arctic Circle in DT center and Antarctica , a 150 - foot - tall wall of NN , around DT rim . NASA employees , PRP say , guard this NN wall to prevent NNS from climbing over and falling off DT disc . ( In keeping with their skepticism of NASA , known flat - earther NN theorist Nathan Thompson recently approached a man he VBD was a NASA employee in a Starbucks in mid-May 2017 . In a YouTube video of DT exchange , Thompson , founder of DT Official Flat NNP and Globe Discussion page , shouted IN he had proof DT NNP is flat — apparently saying an astronaut drowning was DT proof — and IN NASA is "" lying . "" ) NNP 's day and night cycle is explained by positing IN DT sun and moon are spheres measuring 32 miles ( 51 kilometers ) WDT move in circles 3,000 miles ( 4,828 km ) above DT plane of DT NNP . ( Stars , PRP say , move in a plane 3,100 miles up . ) IN spotlights , these celestial spheres illuminate different portions of DT NN in a 24 - hour cycle . Flat - earthers believe EX must RB be an invisible "" antimoon "" WDT obscures DT moon during lunar eclipses . Furthermore , NNP 's gravity is an illusion , PRP say . Objects do not accelerate downward ; instead , DT disc of NNP accelerates upward at 32 feet per second squared ( 9.8 meters per second squared ) , driven up by a mysterious force called dark NN . Currently , EX is disagreement among flat - earthers about whether or not Einstein 's theory of relativity permits NNP to accelerate upward indefinitely without DT NN eventually surpassing DT speed of light . ( Einstein 's laws apparently still hold in this alternate version of reality . ) As for what lies underneath DT disc of NNP , this is unknown , but most flat - earthers believe PRP is composed of "" rocks . "" [ Religion and NN : 6 Visions of Earth's Core ] Then , EX 's DT NN theory : Flat - earthers believe photos of DT globe are photoshopped ; GPS devices are rigged to make airplane pilots VB PRP are flying in straight lines around a sphere when PRP are actually flying in circles above a disc . DT motive for NN governments ' concealment of DT true shape of DT NNP has not been ascertained , but flat - earthers believe PRP is probably financial . "" In a nutshell , PRP MD logically cost much less to fake a space program than to actually have CD , so those in on DT NN profit from DT funding NASA and other space agencies receive from DT NN , "" DT flat - earther website 's FAQ page explains . Who believes DT NNP is flat ? Flat - NN believers are not relegated to DT hidden corners of DT universe : Plenty of celebs have been quite vocal with their beliefs . For instance , on Jan. 25 , 2016 , rapper - singer Bobby Ray Simmons Jr. ( known as B.o.B ) released a track called "" Flatline "" in which he disses astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson , after DT two had a Twitter battle over DT spherical - ness of DT NN . B.o.B is convinced NNP is flat . A day earlier , DT rapper tweeted : "" No matter how high in elevation PRP are ... DT horizon is always eye level ... sorry cadets ... I did n't wanna believe PRP either . "" And then EX 's Shaq . In a podcast WDT aired on Feb. 27 , 2017 , former NBA player Shaquille O'Neal proclaimed our home NN is flat , saying IN when he drives from Florida to California "" PRP 's flat to me . "" Shaq later VBD he was just kidding . [ 5 Scientific Rebuttals of Shaq's Flat - NNP Claims ] Some believers have gotten creative in their quest to prove a flat NN : NN theorist D. Marble posted on YouTube on NNP 1 , 2017 , IN he brought a spirit level aboard a flight from Charlotte , North Carolina to Seattle , Washington , to see whether DT plane 's nose MD dip to "" compensate for curvature "" of DT NNP , he VBD . On DT video , he VBD : "" I recorded a 23 minute and 45 second NN - lapse , which by those measurements means DT plane travelled a little over 203 miles . According to Spherical Trigonometry given to explain DT Heliocentric model , this should have resulted in DT compensation of 5 miles of curvature . As PRP 'll see EX was no measurable compensation for curvature . "" ( DT air bubble in his level remained centered , which he VBD proves DT NNP is flat . ) DT theory follows from a mode of thought called DT "" Zetetic Method , "" an alternative to DT scientific method , developed by a 19th - century flat - earther , in which sensory observations reign supreme . "" Broadly , DT method places a lot of emphasis on reconciling empiricism and rationalism , and making logical deductions based on empirical data , "" Flat NNP Society vice NN Michael Wilmore , an Irishman , told Life 's Little Mysteries . In Zetetic astronomy , DT perception IN NNP is flat leads to DT deduction WDT PRP must actually be flat ; DT antimoon , NASA NN and all DT rest of PRP are just rationalizations for how DT might work in practice . Those details make DT flat - earthers ' theory so elaborately absurd PRP sounds IN a joke , but JJ of its supporters genuinely consider PRP a more plausible model of astronomy than DT NN found in textbooks . In short , PRP are n't kidding . [ 50 Amazing Facts About NNP NNP ] "" DT question of belief and sincerity is CD WDT comes up a lot , "" Wilmore VBD . "" If I had to guess , I MD probably say IN at least some of our members see DT Flat NNP Society and Flat NNP Theory as a kind of epistemological exercise , whether as a critique of DT scientific method or as a kind of ' solipsism for beginners . ' EX are RB probably some who thought DT certificate MD be kind of funny to have on their wall . DT being VBN , I VBP JJ members personally , and I am fully convinced of their belief . "" Wilmore counts himself among DT true believers . "" My own convictions are a result of philosophical introspection and a considerable body of data WDT I have personally observed , and which I am still compiling , ” he VBD . Strangely , Wilmore and DT society 's NN , a 35 - NN - old Virginia - born Londoner named Daniel Shenton , both VBP DT evidence for JJ NN is strong , despite much of this evidence coming from satellite data gathered by NASA , DT kingpin of DT "" round NNP NN . "" PRP RB accept evolution and most other mainstream tenets of NN . As inconceivable as their belief system seems , PRP does n't really surprise experts . Karen Douglas , a psychologist at DT University of Kent in DT NNP Kingdom who studies DT psychology of NN theories , says flat - earthers ' beliefs cohere with those of other NN theorists she has studied . "" PRP seems to me IN these NNS do generally believe IN DT NNP is flat . I 'm not seeing anything WDT sounds as if PRP 're just putting DT idea out RB for any other reason , "" Douglas told Live NNP . She VBD all NN theories share a basic thrust : PRP present an alternative theory about an important issue or event , and construct an ( often ) vague explanation for why someone is covering up DT "" true "" version of events . "" CD of DT major points of appeal is IN PRP explain a big event but often without VBG into details , "" she VBD . "" A lot of DT power lies in DT fact IN PRP are vague . "" DT self - assured way in which NN theorists stick to their story imbues DT story with special appeal . After all , flat - earthers are more adamant IN DT NNP is flat than most NNS are IN DT NNP is round ( probably because DT rest of PRP feel PRP have nothing to prove ) . "" If PRP 're faced with a minority viewpoint WDT is put forth in an intelligent , seemingly well - informed way , and when DT proponents do n't deviate from these strong opinions PRP have , PRP can be very influential . PRP call DT minority influence , "" Douglas VBD . In a NN published online March 5 , 2014 , in DT American Journal of Political NNP , Eric Oliver and Tom Wood , political NNS at DT University of Chicago , found IN about half of Americans endorse at least CD NN theory , from DT notion IN 9/11 was an inside job to DT JFK NN . "" JJ NNS are willing to believe JJ ideas WDT are directly in contradiction to a dominant cultural narrative , "" Oliver told Live NNP . He says conspiratorial belief stems from a human tendency to perceive unseen forces at work , known as magical thinking . [ Top 10 Unexplained Phenomena ] However , flat - earthers do n't fit entirely snugly in this general picture . Most NN theorists adopt JJ fringe theories , even ones WDT contradict each other . Meanwhile , flat - earthers ' only hang - up is DT shape of DT NNP . "" If PRP were IN other NN theorists , PRP should be exhibiting a tendency toward a lot of magical thinking , such as believing in UFOs , ESP , ghosts , DT Devil , or other unseen , intentional forces , "" Oliver wrote in an email . "" PRP does n't sound IN PRP do , which makes them very anomalous relative to most Americans who believe in NN theories .

Conspiracy_NN theories_NNS are_VBP not_RB uniform_JJ –_: nor_CC should_MD our_PRP$ engagements_NNS with_IN them_PRP be_VB ._.","Ever since DT NN spread across DT NN , suspicions have proliferated about what is really VBG on . Questions arose about DT origins of DT NN , DT way PRP makes NNS sick , DT mitigation measures taken , DT suspended civil rights , DT connection with 5G , possible cures and medications , and about DT role of Bill Gates in PRP all . These ideas are commonly framed as NN theories . Yes , PRP MD all distrust DT mainstream narrative and share certain characteristics , but PRP are not CD of a kind . PRP take so JJ different forms and have such varying degrees of plausibility WDT I question how useful PRP is to bracket them all under DT same banner . To understand and effectively respond to DT various NN NN theories , PRP need to dig deeper . Listen to our Expert guide to NN theories , a series by DT Conversation ’s DT Anthill podcast . DT dominant explanation for DT popularity of NN NN theories is remarkably similar : these dark and unsettling ideas help NNS make sense of a complex and uncertain NN . PRP provide sufficiently large explanations for tragic events , and give back feelings of agency and control . Since these ideas sometimes have real - NN consequences , from 5G masts set on fire to ignoring NN mitigation measures , various commentators condemn these NN theories . Officials now need not only fight a NN pandemic , so their story goes , but an infodemic too . DT problem with DT generalising approach is threefold . PRP does not account for DT motivations of NN theorists themselves ; nor for DT different forms and plausibility of DT various NN theories ; nor for their relations with various political and societal issues . Providing uniform explanations for NN theories fails to seriously consider their contents or underlying concerns . Similarly , PRP leaves untouched how certain NN theories are weaponised in various propaganda wars . A closer look at these theories or – even better – actual engagement with DT NNS propagating them , shows NN theories not so much as a uniform coping strategy in unsettling times , but rather as a wide array of cultural expressions . These include suspicions of planned efforts to impose mass vaccinations , doubts about DT origins of DT NN , expressions of disgust for DT ruling elite , geopolitical insinuations , pointers to an inflated NN panic , DT scapegoating of certain societal groups ( Chinese or Jews ) , critiques on DT methods and measurements of NN - CD symptoms and deaths , discontents with powerful philanthropists , worries about DT expansion of authoritarian NN policies , or concerns about corporate intrusion in DT search for effective medications . This means , as I argue in my recent book , IN PRP need to focus on DT meaning , diversity and context of different NN theories , as well as DT NNS who subscribe to them . During my ethnographic research projects on contemporary NN cultures , I encountered a wide variety of NNS , ideas , practices and communities . Because NN NN theories have yet to settle down , let ’s turn to some markedly different NN theory subcultures WDT have been around for longer . PRP illustrate how different NN theories and DT NNS who subscribe to them can be . Starting with DT anti-vaccination movement – of great concern to JJ . Because JJ anti-vaxxers in DT western NN are highly educated urban hipsters , PRP is difficult to reject them as ignorant deplorables . Read more : Throwing NN at anti-vaxxers just makes them more hardline Next to critiques of Big Pharma , NN hesitancy is informed by holistic and naturalistic ideas about NN and DT body ; ideas rooted in alternative medicine and NNP Age spiritualities . In these subcultural worlds , emotions , feelings , experiences , testimonies and social relations are often more important guides than scientific knowledge . Rather different are those active in DT 9/11 Truth Movement . Broadly interested in geopolitics and NN cover ups , these NNS challenge DT mainstream narrative of 9/11 with competing factual and scientific evidence . PRP advance visual proofs and mathematical calculations of why DT towers MD not have collapsed by DT planes , but indicate controlled demolition instead . These activists profess knowledge of physics , construction and explosives , and ground their legitimacy in this expertise . PRP are focused on “ exposing DT official lies ” . IN true activists , PRP wish revolutionary NN , “ to end DT regime and illicit power structures responsible for 9/11 ” . DT list of markedly different NN subcultures MD VB on . VB of DT Flat Earthers , who deploy various scientific methodologies and perform actual experiments in DT outside NN to show IN PRP is not a globe but a Truman Show - JJ dome . Read more : I watched an entire Flat NNP Convention for my research – here 's what I learnt Favouring rational thinking and scientific methods is , however , no guarantee for brotherhood . 9/11 Truthers generally stay away from them as DT MD harm their credibility . QAnon followers , meanwhile , deploy various strategies to interpret secret messages from their anonymous leader Q . These are known as “ crumbs ” or “ drops ” and are all part of their search for truth and redemption . Sharing JJ characteristics of millenarian NNP Religious Movements , QAnon followers anticipate a violent apocalypse when DT NN will be dismantled and followers will be vindicated . This brief overview already shows DT wide variety of themes , ideologies , plausibilities , origins , NNS and potential dangers of different NN theory subcultures .

He was named for a Shawnee chief . William Tecumseh Sherman ( known as “ Cump ” to his friends ) was born in Lancaster , Ohio , on February 8 , 1820 . His father gave him his unusual middle name as a nod to DT Shawnee chief Tecumseh , a magnetic leader who built a confederacy of Ohio Indian tribes and fought with DT British during DT War of 1812 . A relative later wrote IN Sherman ’s father always shook off concerns IN he had given his son a “ savage Indian name ” by arguing , “ Tecumseh was a great warrior . ” After losing his father at DT age of 9 , Sherman was sent to live with Thomas Ewing , a renowned Ohio attorney and family friend who later served as a senator and DT U.S. Secretary of DT Treasury . DT young Sherman grew close with Ewing ’s eldest daughter , Ellen , and PRP regularly corresponded through letters during his tenure at West Point and his early military career . Following a long engagement , DT two were married in 1850 in a Washington , D.C. , ceremony attended by DT likes of NNP Zachary Taylor , Henry Clay and Daniel Webster . DT couple later had eight NNS , two of whom died from sickness while Sherman was serving in DT Civil War . 3 . He played a role in triggering DT California Gold Rush . While stationed in San Francisco in 1848 , Sherman helped convince military governor Richard Mason to investigate CD of DT first reported gold discoveries in California . He was on DT scene during a mission WDT confirmed DT existence of rich gold deposits along DT Sacramento River , and later penned DT letter Mason sent to Washington relaying their findings . Coupled with other early discoveries , Sherman and Mason ’s fact - finding mission inadvertently set off a wave of gold fever in DT NNP NNPS . In less than a NN , California ’s population more than quadrupled after thousands of speculators journeyed west to make their fortune . 4 . He had a rocky career in business . After missing out on combat in DT Mexican American War and enduring a series of lackluster assignments , Sherman left DT military in 1853 to run a San Francisco bank . While he proved a competent businessman , DT move corresponded with DT bursting of DT Gold Rush bubble , and his branch collapsed in DT ensuing financial hysteria . Sherman was left humiliated , in part because JJ military friends — including future Civil War generals Braxton Bragg and George Thomas — had entrusted money to him . To help cover their losses , he eventually liquidated some $ 20,000 worth of his own assets . A despondent Sherman left DT banking NN for good in 1858 . He later signed on as DT first superintendent of DT Louisiana NNP Seminary of Learning and Military Academy — DT school WDT MD become Louisiana NNP University . 5 . He MD have suffered a nervous breakdown during DT Civil War . Following a promising performance at July 1861 ’s First Battle of Bull Run , Sherman was promoted to brigadier general and eventually given command of Union troops in Kentucky and Tennessee . Sherman had n’t wanted DT role , and in short order , DT weight of its responsibilities took a toll on his mental NN . He vastly overestimated DT size of Confederate forces in DT region , griped in his dispatches to NNP Lincoln and appeared constantly on edge . Historians have since speculated IN he was suffering from depression or nervous exhaustion , but whatever its cause , DT general ’s bizarre behavior eventually found its way into DT papers , some of which labeled him insane . Sherman requested to be relieved from his position in early November 1861 , and remained sidelined until DT December , when he was reassigned to DT Western Theater . He was later placed under DT command of General Ulysses S. Grant , and following a crucial victory at April 1862 ’s Battle of Shiloh , DT pair forged a winning partnership WDT lasted for DT remainder of DT war . 6 . He cut off all lines of communication during DT march to DT NN . Sherman ’s March to DT NNP was CD of DT most stunning operations of DT Civil War , yet few NNS outside of Georgia knew anything about PRP while PRP was underway . Before leaving Atlanta , Sherman intentionally severed all telegraph links to DT North to help shroud his moves in secrecy . DT plan meant DT Confederates MD only speculate about where Sherman and his 60,000 - strong rampaging army were headed , but PRP RB left DT Union high command in DT dark about DT mission ’s progress . When asked about Sherman ’s whereabouts , a worried NNP Lincoln is VBN to have responded , “ PRP VBP what hole he went in , but PRP do n’t VB what hole he will come out of . ” Sherman MD finally reappear on December 22 , having slashed and burned his way through DT heart of Georgia . Upon reaching DT NN , he sent a famous message to Lincoln WDT read : “ I beg to present PRP as a Christmas gift DT city of Savannah . ” 7 . He offered lenient terms of surrender to defeated Confederates . Despite his reputation for “ hard ” warfare , Sherman MD RB be surprisingly — perhaps even naively — generous in victory . When he accepted Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston ’s surrender in Durham , North Carolina , in April 1865 , Sherman offered very forgiving terms WDT granted general amnesty to DT rebels and even allowed for DT Southern NNS to immediately re-enter DT Union upon swearing an oath of allegiance . DT sweeping agreement enraged U.S. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton , who rejected PRP out of hand and criticized Sherman for giving up “ all DT advantages PRP had gained from DT war . ” Joseph Johnston was forced to surrender under more conventional terms , but he went on to become a good friend to Sherman , and even served as a pallbearer at his old adversary ’s funeral in 1891 . 8 . He RB used his “ scorched NN ” brand of warfare against Native Americans . After DT Civil War , Sherman was given command of DT Military Division of DT Mississippi and tasked with pacifying DT Plains Indians during DT building of DT transcontinental railroad . Sherman took to DT job with characteristic vigor , orchestrating DT relocation of DT tribes and warning their chiefs , “ PRP cannot stop DT locomotive any more than PRP can stop DT sun or DT moon , and PRP must submit . ” To help break DT natives ’ spirit , Sherman took a page from his Civil War playbook and set his sights on destroying CD of their primary resources : DT buffalo . Beginning in DT late 1860s , he organized DT killing of some 5 million bison in an effort to drive DT creatures to DT brink of extinction . Sherman continued his harsh policies after becoming commanding general of DT army in 1869 , and by DT 1870s , he had helped force most of DT Plains peoples onto reservations . 9 . He repeatedly declined to run for NN . Sherman made no secret of his disdain for politics , once quipping IN he MD rather spend four NNS in jail than in DT White House . Nevertheless , during DT 1870s and 1880s , Washington D.C. , movers and shakers often tried — and failed — to convince him to make a run at DT presidency . Sherman tried to stamp out DT speculation once and for all in 1884 , when he turned down an invitation to become DT Republican candidate by saying , “ I will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected . ” His unequivocal response has since become famous in political circles , where similar flat refusals are often dubbed “ Shermanesque statements . ”"

Melges — who himself , in 1985 , took into his care DT homeless woman Lois Lang who assassinated CIA paymaster Nick Deak — and IN afterwards saw DT CIA ’s black operations monies being controlled by Ralph G. Blasey Jr. — who , not so mysteriously , just happens to be DT father of Dr. Christine Blasey . [ Note : Some words and / or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words / phrases having no exact counterpart . ] According to this report , with NNP being warned , just prior to his assuming DT presidency , by DT powerful Democratic Party NNP Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer IN NNP intelligence services “ have six ways from Sunday at getting back at PRP ” , this past nearly two NNS has shown just how prescient this warning was — and whose latest “ strike back ” against NNP is coming courtesy of a rogue CIA faction who have just trotted out for JJ display Dr. Christine Blasey ( married name Christine Blasey Ford ) — who claims IN as a young high school teenager Brett Kavanaugh , RB a high school teenager , tried to sexually assault her — but whose “ evidence ” for this being true shows Dr. Blasey unable to name DT exact NN PRP happened , her not remembering where DT incident took place or how she got home , her not being able to remember key details of DT incident , her not remembering how DT gathering came together DT night of DT incident , and her not telling anyone else about at DT NN — but should be expected to be DT case from an unproven salacious allegation of this sort as PRP comes from a woman supporting DT Democratic Party and who , RB , hates NNP NNP . As DT “ ” aligned mainstream propaganda NN began flooding DT airwaves , newspapers and internet with Dr. Blasey ’s claims against Judge Kavanaugh , WDT have absolutely no proof or evidence behind anyone MD ever investigate , this report continues , SVR intelligence analysts were immediately able to bring up her file in DT archive of known and / or suspected CIA operatives — and whose placement in this file was due to her extensive and advanced educational training at Stanford University in DT CIA - funded mind control - brainwashing techniques developed by Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges — whose primary mission for DT CIA was to develop JJ technologies for interrogation and torture , secondary applications VBG towards studying DT possibilities of exploiting highly “ suggestible ” subjects and getting them to do things — murders , couriers — PRP MD n’t otherwise do , and of which PRP MD have no memory in case PRP were caught . Linked to Dr. Blasey ’s SVR file of known and / or suspected CIA operatives , this report notes , is IN of her father Ralph G. Blasey Jr. — a proven CIA operative who , from June - 1962 to January - 1974 , was DT Vice NNP of National Savings and Trust of Washington , D.C. — a CIA black budget bank best known for being 100 paces from DT White House , and whom , in 1998 , was taken over by SunTrust Bank — whose majority share owner is DT CIA - linked investment fund BlackRock . DT importance of noting DT CIA banking connections of Ralph G. Blasey Jr. , this report explains , is due to DT outbreak of what is now known as DT “ CIA Bank War ” — and whose start of , in 1982 , a CIA seized from publication NN report ( Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/05 : CIA - RDP90-00965R00150010 - 7 ) describes as : “ This is Wall Street , DT center of DT international banking system , a system on DT edge of a crisis so severe IN DT Central Intelligence Agency is preparing drastic measures . Something must be done to avert DT breakdown of DT Free NNP 's monetary system . ” DT main CIA operative involved in this war , and whom Ralph G. Blasey Jr. reported to , this report details , was Nicholas Deak — a longtime OSS and CIA operative , both during and after NNP War II , who ran DT CIA ’s main black budget operations under DT direct command of DT feared CIA Counterintelligence Chief James Jesus Angleton . To how DT CIA prevented DT total breakdown of DT Western banking system in 1982 , this report says , was by their illegally laundering hundreds - of - millions of dollars of Colombian drug cartel cash into PRP to keep PRP afloat in an operation overseen by DT CIA ’s “ James Bond of Money ” Nickolas Deak — but when DT NNP Ronald Reagan administration found out what DT CIA had done , and started investigating PRP , saw Deak , on CD November 1985 , being assassinated in his NNP York City office by a homeless woman named Lois Lang — who had mysteriously managed to travel thousands - of - miles across DT NNP NNPS from Seattle to conduct this killing in what NN reports at DT NN described as : Lang saw him and turned DT corner with purpose , aiming DT pistol with both arms . When she had Deak in her sights , she froze , transfixed . “ PRP was as if she ’d finally found what she was looking for , ” a witness later testified . Deak seized DT pause to lunge and grab Lang ’s throat with both hands , pressing his body into hers . She fired once next to Deak ’s ear and missed wide , before pushing him away just enough to bring DT gun into his body and land a shot above his heart . DT bullet ricocheted off his collarbone and shredded his organs . Deak crumbled onto DT floor . “ Now PRP ’ve got yours , ” VBD Lang . A witness later claimed she took out a camera and snapped photographs of her victim ’s expiring body . DT bag lady then grabbed DT banker by DT legs , dragged him into his office , and shut DT door . Though DT American NNS were correctly told IN Nicolas Deak assassin Lois Lang had previously been under psychiatric care , this report continues , what was failed to be reported to them was IN Lang had been under DT direct care and JJ supervision of DT CIA ’s own Stanford University Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges just prior to her traveling from Seattle to NNP York City to carry out this assassination — and who was DT exact type of assassin Dr. Melges had been working to create in his CIA - funded mind control MKULTRA programme — and whose Canadian victims of are still being silenced after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , this past December , imposed a gag order on them to keep them silent — but DT does apply to Judge Kavanaugh accuser Dr. Christine Blasey , who remains able to teach her CIA Undergraduate Internship Program at Stanford University DT MKULTRA mind control techniques discovered by Dr. Melges . IN his daughter Dr. Christine Blasey , this report concludes , CIA black money operative Ralph G.

Regardless_RB ,_, there_EX is_VBZ little_JJ harm_NN ._.","Grounding , RB called earthing , is a therapeutic technique WDT involves doing activities WDT “ ground ” or electrically reconnect PRP to DT NN . This practice relies on earthing NN and grounding physics to explain how from DT NN can have positive effects on your body . This type of grounding therapy is n’t entirely DT same as DT technique WDT is used in mental NN treatment . In this article , PRP ’ll explore DT NN behind grounding NN , DT risks and benefits of using earthing techniques , and how to perform grounding . What DT NN says Grounding is currently an under - researched topic and EX are very few scientific studies on DT benefits . However , DT most recent scientific research has explored grounding for inflammation , cardiovascular NN , muscle damage , chronic pain , and mood . DT central theory from CD is IN grounding affects DT living matrix , which is DT central connector between living cells . Electrical conductivity exists within DT matrix WDT functions as an immune system defense , similar to antioxidants . PRP believe IN through grounding , DT natural defenses of DT body can be restored . Further research expands on this idea . In a on grounding and heart NN , 10 healthy participants were grounded using patches on DT palms of their hands and soles of their feet . Blood measurements were taken before and after grounding to determine any changes in red blood cell fluidity , which plays a role in heart NN . DT results indicated significantly less red blood cell clumping after grounding , which suggests benefits for cardiovascular NN . Another slightly examined DT role of grounding on post - exercise muscle damage . Researchers used both grounding patches and mats and measured creatine kinase , white blood cell count , and pain levels before and after grounding . Blood work indicated IN grounding reduced muscle damage and pain in participants . This suggests IN grounding MD influence healing abilities . This research is supported by a recent on grounding for pain reduction and mood improvement . Sixteen massage therapists alternated between periods of grounding and no grounding . Before grounding therapy , physical and emotional stress and pain were common side effects of their physically demanding jobs . After DT earthing therapy , pain , stress , depression , and fatigue were all reduced among participants . Most of DT studies on grounding are small and rely somewhat on subjective measures , such as self - reported feelings , mood , or even self - administered treatment . Some studies RB rely on blood markers , such as those WDT detect inflammation , but DT size and shortage of these studies suggests IN more research is needed . EX are JJ types of grounding . All of them focus on reconnecting yourself to DT NN . This can be done through either direct or indirect contact with DT NN . Have PRP ever been outside on a warm summer day and felt DT urge to run barefoot in DT grass ? CD of DT easiest ways to ground yourself to DT NN is to walk barefoot . Whether this is on grass , sand , or even mud , allowing your skin to touch DT natural ground can provide PRP with grounding NN . PRP can increase your skin - to - NN contact by lying on DT ground . PRP can do PRP in DT grass by DT park or on DT sand at DT beach . If PRP ’re VBG to ground yourself in this way , be sure to take DT proper precautions and never lie somewhere PRP MD be injured . According to advocates for grounding , NN MD be used to ground in DT same way DT physical NN is used for grounding . PRP suggest simply wading in a clear lake or swimming in DT ocean as a way to ground yourself . As always , be sure to stay safe when swimming , especially in murky or deep waters . When VBG outside to ground yourself is n’t an option , EX are . CD method of earthing involves connecting a metal rod to DT ground outside and then connecting DT rod to your body through a wire . If PRP ’re not comfortable using a metal rod to ground yourself , EX ’s other grounding equipment available . This equipment is an effective way to incorporate earthing therapy into your daily life and includes : PRP can find grounding mats , sheets , blankets , socks , and bands online . EX ’s not much research on DT benefits of grounding . However , NNS have reported improvement for conditions such as : • Chronic fatigue . In DT on massage therapists , JJ reported a decrease in their fatigue levels after four weeks of treatment with grounding mats . • Chronic pain . DT on grounding for exercise recovery found IN those who used grounding patches reported lower pain levels . • Anxiety and depression . In CD small , PRP was shown IN even 1 hour of grounding therapy can significantly improve mood . • Sleep disorders . DT massage therapists RB experienced an improvement in sleep length and reduce sleep disturbances with grounding therapy . • Cardiovascular NN . Results of CD treatment found IN long - term self - administered grounding therapy helped to reduce blood pressure levels in participants with hypertension . As mentioned above , JJ of these studies are small and require further research . Still , some NN professionals believe IN DT benefits of grounding therapy MD come simply from feeling IN PRP ’re reconnected to nature . Regardless , EX is little harm ."

War is about killing human beings . PRP see , I am a killer . I have participated in killing other human beings . DT Vietnamese soldiers were trying to kill PRP . PRP were all young and brainwashed , and were n't smart enough ( yet ) to VB what PRP were being asked to do . I was on a firebase next to Highway NNP , a main thoroughfare in south Vietnam WDT ran through a portion of DT country known as DT Elephant 's Ear . PRP was called DT Elephant 's Ear because of DT shape of DT border 's protrusion into Cambodia . Ours was an artillery station WDT carried a battery ( 6 ) of 105 mm howitzers and a battery of 155 mm howitzers . These are very big guns . PRP were RB camp to others : mortar squads , infantry units and sundry support services . This was in 1968 , DT NN of DT "" Tet Offensive "" , DT great push by DT North Vietnamese Army and DT Viet Cong ( civilian anti-American guerrilla forces ) to rid DT country of DT "" foreign invaders "" ( PRP ) . PRP was CD peaceful Sunday evening in March , a cooler day in DT hottest part of DT NN . Everyone was VBG on their usual routines of duty and maintenence when DT shit hit DT fan . Mortars began to whistle in . DT cry , "" Incoming , incoming "" went over DT landing zone 's p.a. system . Everyone went to DT trenches , or found whatever cover PRP MD . I was caught out in DT open . My only alternative was lay flat on DT hard NN , not far from DT trench dug for our unit . Shells rained down all around . Explosions went off everywhere , and my unit remained in DT trench . I screamed "" PRP better VB up here and do something , "" to DT guys in DT trench . I thought PRP were cowering . PRP were not cowering . PRP had not received orders yet , and PRP does nothing in DT military without orders . Nearby , CD or two of DT fire pits , where excess round charges were kept , went up in pillars of fire . Gaining some self control , I went to DT NN supply and poured NN on DT fire pits WDT were close to my unit to prevent them from VBG up in flames . DT other members of my unit were still in DT foxhole awaiting orders . DT orders came . "" Battery , adjust . Shell H.E. , lot six , fuse NN , deflection 1540 , azimuth 320 . "" This told DT unit how to adjust DT aim of DT huge guns . PRP all went about our tasks of preparing DT big guns efficiently , heedless in this hour of necessity of DT death whistling nearby , blind to everything but our task . Our hope only was group survival . This violence and shelling and death went on all night . As various units ran out of ordinance , PRP went through open areas to deliver fifty pound rounds on our shoulders . PRP were aware of , but not reacting to , DT threat of instant death or injury all around PRP . After a number of hours ( who can say how JJ or how few ) exhaustion set in , and me and a buddy crawled into a culvert to sleep , DT battle still raging all around , but PRP were too exhausted to care . When I awoke , all was quiet , but DT aftermath of DT battle was RB . EX was devastation all around . I found IN DT perimeter had been broached a number of times but superior firepower had stopped DT NNS trying to break in , leaving their bodies to pile up inbetween DT outer ring of wire and DT inner . EX were bodies all around , or parts of bodies , or bodies blown in half , or bodies with heads split open looking for all DT NN IN some kind of watermelon , with their bright red insides . Hundreds of parts or half or whole bodies . Numbers impossible to estimate accurately , due to DT dismembered NN of DT dead . EX were probably hundreds . I stopped and gazed down at DT corpse of a young boy , a dead N.V.A. soldier , and I saw someone very much IN myself . Unlike others nearby , he was whole . No apparant cause of death visible . I stared into his face , wondering about him . What kind of person was he ? Who was DT family he had left behind ? Now I VBP IN his family MD be left wondering forever whatever happened to him , because PRP MD never have his remains . PRP , after NNS of hope and greif , MD have to either assume him dead , or maybe lost , him only a memory . I still see his face these JJ NNS later , a brother unto me , me alive , him dead . He was as if sleeping , still free from obvious corruption if not for DT pallor of his skin or DT flies moving in and out of his nose . Shortly after dawn , PRP were called to order . Some names did not answer to roll call . No explanations at DT NN were forthcoming . Tasks were given out . "" Who wants body detail ? "" VBD DT sargeant . Only CD or two volunteered . "" Ok , PRP , PRP , PRP , PRP and PRP , VB out RB and clean up . "" DT men were divided into teams , given wheelbarrows , and were sent out to bring DT bodies and parts to a specific place . DT went on all morning . PRP took a few days for DT bulldozer to be shipped in by flying crane , and when PRP arrived , a giant pit was dug and all DT human remains WDT were collectable were buried RB . Our dead , about seven , were shipped home to DT NNS . JJ of DT enemy dead were not able to be collected . PRP were in enemy territory , and were left to DT enemy . JJ had been wounded and crawled to hidden areas in DT surrounding jungle where PRP died later . Some were near unexploded ordinance and were extremely dangerous . DT end result was DT stench of death . God , what a stench . PRP was all - pervading . Another result was a plague of flies . PRP had to eat anyway , knowing IN DT flies WDT were living on DT human carnage were DT same ones WDT were landing on your sandwich . EX were clouds of white termite - IN flies WDT presumably fed on DT dead , and these were called "" body bugs "" and were avoided as much as possible . DT white flies were probably taking DT blame for DT other , more ordinary flies , who were more easily tolerated but who were in actuality RB feeding off DT same "" table . "" With NN and burial , DT plague of flies and DT stench lessened . As DT weeks went by , DT battle was just another psychological scar torn through DT distance of self , to be buried in DT press of duty , to emerge NNS later , leaving PRP weeping unexpectedly at jovial occasions , much to DT puzzlement of your family or friends . Some of DT enemy had gotten through DT perimeter , and had in a suicidal paroxysm , tried to do as much damage as possible before being killed . CD private , recently promoted to "" temporary corporal "" in lieu of his later promised advancement , ( PRP called them "" candy stripers "" as PRP wore a black band with their future rank on PRP ) was able to put an end to CD of these invaders . He had shot him through DT back , DT automatic weapons fire ( m16 ) moving through his body in a pattern , making a series of holes through from DT back to DT front of DT body IN buttons on a jacket . This individual took polaroid photos of his "" trophy "" and gave them to me for safe keeping . Why he had selected me for this task was n't clear , but I was DT wrong person to give them to . I buried them , repelled by DT concept of human dead as trophy material . I got into a big fight when he tried to VB his photos and I VBD IN I had "" lost "" them . Lots of others were not so squeamish , however . Some kept photos , or articles of clothing , weapons , medals or body parts , mostly ears , dried in DT sun to a leather IN texture , from DT ones PRP killed . I remember Sgt. Hirshberg telling me IN he had to boil a belt WDT he got from a N.V.A. soldier 's corpse for two days to VB DT stink of death out of PRP . Soon after , Sgt. Hirshberg himself was found dead . Perhaps an N.V.A. soldier boiled his belt . DT kind of thing WDT was as common as bread , then . Death . Human beings lowered to DT basest impulses within themselves , killed other human beings for DT thrill of PRP , easily and without thought as easily as PRP MD fish in your pocket for NN to take DT bus . Killing is legal , RB . PRP MD VB to prison here , or perhaps VB DT death penalty for DT killing and and DT mutiliation . In Vietnam PRP was sport . No morality . No ethics about who shall die and live . Nope . Death was sport . Or revenge . Often , DT enemy MD horribly mutilate our dead , to instill terror or just to say "" fuck PRP "" in DT worst way possible . PRP MD retaliate in kind . I remember a group of infantry men telling how PRP cut off DT penises of their enemy and shoved them in DT mouths of DT newly dead as a kind of "" fuck PRP back "" gesture . Death then becomes a kind of communication , a grisly "" postcard "" if PRP will . Forget about right and wrong . PRP does n't exist . Only survival , hatred , revenge and killing . In DT crucible of war , PRP all boils down to DT lowest denominators . EX is little mercy . When PRP human beings are placed in a kill or be killed situation , PRP can only become killers . PRP see our friends die and revenge is our only outlet . PRP make DT most of DT situation by becoming DT most beautiful artistic killer possible . Right and wrong ? A just war ? DT military was engaged in a psychological war as well , entreating by helicopter equipped with speakers for DT enemy to "" give up , give up . PRP will be treated fairly and those of PRP who are innocent will be sent back to your families "" . PRP flew over DT countryside calling out in DT Vietnamese language , "" Chiu hoi , chiu hoi ... "" PRP RB dropped leaflets with DT same message by DT thousands over DT land . I saw firsthand DT benefits of this "" mercy program . "" I was watching as an N.V.A. soldier was cornered in DT nearby countryside and had decided to give in to DT cries of "" chiu hoi "" WDT our soldiers were making . He put his weapons on DT ground . He stood up with his hands behind his head . A burst of gunfire and a "" Take DT , motherfucker "" and PRP was over . PRP was n't a puzzle to me why DT program met with little success . I have n't even gotten to DT non combatants yet . Men , women and NNS , innocents all , falling to DT stray bullet , being blown apart by DT hidden mine , town destroyed by DT misplaced bomb , or worse . PRP seems IN PRP have forgotten about Lt. William Calley and DT village of Mi Lai . William Calley was court martialed and found guilty of DT massacre of a number of innocent men women and NNS . He rounded up DT inhabitants of this small hamlet , collected them together as possible enemy collaborators and ordered them all to be killed , burning DT village after . DT men who refused to fire upon DT NNS who played a major part in his conviction . William Calley was an offering to DT millions who were protesting DT war here at home . JJ others followed his methods and were not punished for their crimes . PRP suffer only DT nightmares WDT doubtless still haunt them . PRP is estimated by some IN CD to three million non-combatants , civilians , died as a direct or indirect result of DT Viet Nam conflict . I must believe IN EX are other ways . I must believe IN PRP can find other means . To VB otherwise MD be anathematic to my very life , and I MD either retreat into irreversible insanity or suicide , as so JJ of my fellows have done . Is PRP any wonder IN DT war veteran has DT highest rate of "" non-functionality "" : drug addiction , alcholism and suicide , of any other group ? Do PRP VB IN war veterans comprise DT largest part of DT homeless ? I VBP why PRP "" drop out "" . For NNS , I was unemployed , way , way into drugs . I found PRP impossible to work a job WDT paid taxes to DT Death Machine . By DT grace of God I escaped DT fate of so JJ , to be reduced to a voiceless suffering shell of what I MD be . I came back alive from this cauldron of death to tell PRP IN EX must be another way . So JJ others did not come back , will not come back , and I speak for them . Let PRP pray for peace ."

DT massive 12 - nation free trade agreement has been negotiated in secret now for almost four NNS , and DT information release by WikiLeaks shows IN key environmental safeguards in DT agreement are being stripped away , including a ban on shark fining and illegal logging , as well as legally - enforced pollution regulations . “ If DT environment chapter is finalized as written in this leaked document , NNP Obama ’s environmental trade record MD be worse than George W. Bush ’s , ” Michael Brune , executive director of DT Sierra Club , VBD bluntly . “ This draft chapter falls flat on every single CD of our issues — oceans , fish , wildlife , and forest protections — and in fact , rolls back on DT progress made in past free trade pacts . ” DT TPP has been CD of DT Obama Administration ’s top priorities for DT Pacific region , but green groups say IN PRP looks IN DT administration has given significant ground on crucial environmental issues in a desire to VB DT deal signed , which has already run past its goal of finalization by 2013 . JJ past free trade agreements have wholly lacked any legally - binding environmental safeguards , but in 2007 then U.S. NNP George W. Bush struck an agreement with democrats to include environmental safeguards in all future free trade agreements . However , environmentalists are now concerned IN this requirement will bring about little environmental gains in DT TPP . For example , DT draft text completely lacks any enforcement . An analysis by Jane Kelsey with DT University of Aukland finds IN DT draft text “ falls far below DT standards ” set by DT U.S. Congress in 2007 . “ Negotiators are allowing a unique opportunity to protect wildlife and support legal sustainable trade of renewable resources to slip through their fingers . these nations account for more than a quarter of JJ trade in fish and wood products and PRP have a responsibility to address trade ’s impact on wildlife crime , illegal logging , and overfishing , ” VBD Carter Roberts , NNP of NNP Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) , who called DT information leak a “ peek behind DT curtain . ” According to DT release by WikiLeaks , DT TPP as PRP stands does not even require member nations to uphold commitments to JJ environmental agreements , such DT Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) . Criticism of DT TPP goes well - beyond environmental issues , however . JJ groups have complained of DT investor - NN settlement agreement in DT plan WDT allows corporations to sue NNS when contracts are breached . Critics of this model say PRP benefits foreign investors as PRP expense of human rights , working conditions , and DT environment .

EX appear to be rocklike structures and flowing liquid on Titan - even , PRP believe , a form of liquid methane rainfall . NN - JJ characteristics described Friday by NNS at DT European Space Institute in Paris . Just a week ago , NNS were applauding DT successful landing of DT space probe , which plunged through DT murky , chilling air of Titan to land on a spongy surface PRP described as wet sand or soft clay . PRP appears a mysterious , pinkish orangey NN . Pictures sent by DT probe showed a flat terrain with fist - sized objects WDT researchers described as chunks of NN . Now , NNS have been able to sift through dozens of images sent by DT Huygens space probe over DT space of several hours before its batteries went dead . Martin Tomasko , CD of DT principal investigators for DT Titan project , describes some of DT grainy , black and white images to reporters . "" This is a field of view CD kilometer across and PRP see this very rugged terrain , "" he says . "" PRP see a ridge system . "" DT pictures show spidery dark lines etched on Titan 's surface . EX are RB lighter areas . PRP appear a mystery to ordinary viewers . But DT projects NNS believe PRP are rivers , streams and channels of liquid . Only DT liquid is n't NN , which MD be frozen solid at on Titan , where PRP 's around 170 degrees below zero . Instead , DT evidence is IN PRP 's liquid methane . NNS even believe PRP rains regularly on this far - off moon , located a four billion kilometer journey through DT Solar System from NN . Only PRP 's methane rain . And DT 's not all . EX appears to be stuff IN dirt on Titan , and large chunks WDT are similar to rocks . NNS believe DT sandy substance is in fact shards of crushed NN on Titan . DT rocklike substances are larger chunks of NN . Titan seems vastly different from our home NN , but European Space Agency mission manager Jean - Pierre Lebreton says he is struck by DT similarities . "" Our JJ picture of Titan is really fascinating . And what PRP are seeing is NN - JJ processes on Titan . But DT big difference is DT ingredients are somewhat different . DT liquid on Titan is methane , DT liquid on NN is NN . DT rocks on NN are silicate . DT rocks on Titan are NN blocks . And DT dirt on NN is our dirt . DT dirt on Titan is organic matter , "" he says . Only a week after receiving date from DT Huygens probe , DT NNS ' findings are still preliminary . PRP say PRP will take weeks and months to sift through DT rich trove of data sent by DT space probe . And PRP say JJ mysteries remain . DT Titan landing is a joint project by European and American NNS . PRP took DT Huygens probe seven NNS to reach DT NN , traveling aboard DT Saturn probe Cassini . And PRP took Huygens more than two hours to float down to Titan 's surface , slowed down by parachutes . DT probe settled some 10 - 15 centimeters into DT top layers of Titans spongy surface . Scientist Martin Tomasko says DT probe seems to have settled in a dry corner of DT NN - similar to parts of Africa or DT NNP NNPS . "" DT region PRP landed in is more typical of arid regions on DT NN . PRP do n't VB PRP have open pools of liquid methane , but DT methane kind of sinks down into DT surface material , into DT sand , if PRP will . PRP 's more IN Arizona , or a place IN DT , where DT river beds are dry most of DT NN , "" he says . Because DT probe landed on only CD area of Titan , NNS have no idea whether PRP 's representative of DT entire moon , or whether EX are more humid regions elsewhere . PRP RB do n't VB whether Titan has seasons - IN a rainy season and a dry season . But PRP do believe EX is regular precipitation on Titan ; PRP MD very well have rained liquid methane DT day before DT probe landed . DT Titan findings mark a coup for DT 15 - country European Space Agency , which worked in collaboration with America 's NASA . DT Europeans are RB savoring an earlier success of a Mars mission , which produced photographs , which its NNS say offer DT most direct evidence IN NN in DT form of NN MD exist on DT NN . Other future projects include two other missions to Mars and CD to Venus . And NNS Friday suggested PRP might be possible to explore Titan in DT future with a moving rover . Even with its NN - JJ characteristics , PRP 's almost impossible to imagine existing in Saturn 's frozen , far - off moon . But EX MD come a day - a very long NN from now - when Titan MD actually be livable for carbon - based life forms IN PRP VBP here on NNP . Scientist Toby Owen , from DT Institute for Astronomy in Hawaii , explains . "" In about four billion NNS , our sun will expand and will become a red giant . And when than happens , EX 's been a couple of scientific papers WDT have suggested IN DT temperatures in DT outer solar system will rise , long after life has become impossible on NN . Temperatures will rise on Titan , DT NN NN will melt , DT NN NN will be released , and because PRP have DT very basic building blocks for life in DT form of organic molecules , for a very brief NN , Titan MD be a very good place , "" he says . for life . But for right now , PRP seems clear IN humans are far better off exploring Titan from where PRP are now -- our warm , oxygenated and faraway NN , NNP ."

When DT NNP Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto in July 2015 , researchers observed an astonishing variety of terrains across DT dwarf NN . Flat and cratered areas on DT dwarf NN 's surface point to its varied geological activity , composition and evolution over NN . DT jagged spikes targeted in this latest NN form at DT highest altitudes on Pluto 's surface , near its atmosphere , where methane is able to freeze out of DT atmosphere — skipping straight from solid to gas without ever becoming liquid . When DT NN is a bit warmer , parts of DT methane NN sublimate away , heading straight back to gas form , according to DT JJ NN . "" When PRP realized IN bladed terrain consists of tall deposits of methane NN , PRP asked ourselves why PRP forms all of these ridges , as opposed to just being big blobs of NN on DT ground , "" Jeffrey Moore , a NNP Horizons team member and lead researcher on DT JJ work , VBD in a statement . "" PRP turns out IN Pluto undergoes NN variation and sometimes , when Pluto is a little warmer , DT methane NN begins to basically ' evaporate ' away . "" On NNP , such structures are called penitentes , and stretch just a few meters in height in high - altitude regions along DT NN 's equator . Slight irregularities can turn into dramatic spikes of snow as DT structures ' surfaces concentrate sunlight toward certain regions , sublimating some parts faster than others and leading to longer and spikier forms . DT presence of penitentes on Pluto tell researchers more about how its surface and air temperature VBP over NN , according to DT statement , and DT link between methane 's presence and high elevations can help researchers map DT dwarf NN 's topography in places where PRP have lower - resolution views .

CD of DT sites most affected by DT devastation was DT Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant , which experienced a partial meltdown two days after DT quake . DT incident is being called DT worst nuclear accident since DT 1986 disaster at Chernobyl , and PRP has shown few signs of slowing down . Click ahead to see 11 other history - making nuclear disasters . By Daniel Bukszpan , Special To CNBC.com Posted 16 Mar 2011 On April 26 , 1986 , a reactor at DT Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine exploded , causing DT worst nuclear accident DT NN has seen . PRP sent a plume into DT atmosphere with radioactive fallout WDT was 400 times greater than DT released in DT atomic bombing of Hiroshima . DT plume drifted across much of DT western Soviet Union . Parts of Eastern , Northern and Western Europe were RB affected . Fifty NNS were killed at DT reactor site at DT NN of DT accident , but DT number of NNS across Europe who found themselves in DT path of DT radioactive plume is anybody ’s guess . A report from DT NNP Nuclear Association ( http://world-nuclear.org/info/chernobyl/inf07.html) claims IN over CD million NNS MD have been exposed to radiation . However , DT full extent of DT damage is unlikely to ever be known . Until March 2011 , DT worst nuclear accident in DT history of Japan took place at a uranium facility in Tokaimura on September 30 , 1999 . Three workers were attempting to mix nitric acid and uranium to form DT fuel uranyl nitrate . However , DT workers unknowingly used seven times DT allowable limit of uranium , and DT reactor MD n’t stop DT solution from reaching critical mass . DT three technicians were exposed to massive gamma and neutron radiation poisoning , which killed two of them . More than 70 other workers received high doses of radiation as well . After an investigation , DT International Atomic NNP Agency saidthat DT accident had been caused by "" human error and serious breaches of safety principles . "" DT worst nuclear accident in U.S. history took place on March 28 , 1979 at DT Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania . A cooling system failed , causing a partial meltdown , but a full meltdown was averted and EX were no fatalities . However , despite DT positive outcome and despite DT passage of more than 30 NNS , DT incident remains fresh in DT minds of those who are old enough to remember PRP . DT effect of DT accident on DT U.S. nuclear power industry was major . DT meltdown gave JJ Americans second thoughts about DT risks of using nuclear power , and DT construction of JJ reactors , which had been steadily increasing since DT 1960s , slowed substantially . Over 50 nuclear plant construction projects were cancelled in just four NNS , and DT number of ongoing projects declined from 1980 until 1998 . CD of DT worst nuclear contamination incidents in DT NN took place in Goiania , Brazil . A radiotherapy institute in DT city had relocated , leaving behind a teletherapy unit WDT still contained cesium chloride . On September 13 , 1987 , two scavengers found DT unit , carted PRP away in a wheelbarrow and sold PRP to a junkyard . DT owner invited friends and family to see DT glowing blue material inside , inadvertently exposing them to radiation . All of them then went their separate ways and irradiated friends and family all over DT city . In all , 245 NNS were exposed to radiation and four NNS died . According to Eliana Amaral of DT International Atomic NNP Agency , CD good thing came out of DT catastrophe . "" Before DT 1987 accident … EX was no awareness IN sources must be controlled from ‘ cradle to grave ’ and to prevent DT NN accessing them . After DT accident these concepts were fostered . "" On July 4 , 1961 , DT Soviet submarine K - CD was in DT North Atlantic Ocean when PRP developed a radioactive leak . PRP had no coolant system in place to stop DT reactor from overheating and exploding , so with no other options , DT crew entered DT reactor compartment and fixed DT leak , exposing themselves to levels of radiation in DT process WDT were certain to kill them . All eight crew members who had fixed DT leak died of radiation poisoning within three weeks of DT incident . DT rest of DT crew , DT submarine and DT ballistic missiles WDT PRP carried RB became contaminated . When K - CD met up with DT submarine WDT had intercepted its distress call , PRP was towed to base , which PRP contaminated . Then , as PRP was repaired over DT course of two NNS , DT surrounding area and DT repair workers RB became contaminated . Twenty of DT submarine ’s original crew RB died of radiation sickness over DT next few NNS . In DT NNS following NNP War II , DT NNP NNPS was DT foremost nuclear power in DT NN . In an effort to catch up , DT Soviet Union quickly built nuclear power plants and cut corners in order to keep pace . DT Mayak plant near DT city of Kyshtym had a tank with a substandard cooling system as a result , and when PRP failed , DT increasing temperature caused an explosion WDT contaminated almost 500 miles of DT surrounding area . Initially , DT Soviet NN did n’t disclose what had happened , but CD week later PRP had little choice . 10,000 NNS were evacuated from DT area when some began to show signs of radiation sickness . Although DT Soviet NN refused to disclose any information about DT accident , a NN in Radiation and Environmental Biophysicsestimates IN at least 200 NNS died from exposure to radiation . DT Soviet NN finally declassified information about DT disaster in 1990 . On October 10 , 1957 , Windscale became DT site of DT worst nuclear accident in British history , and DT worst in DT NN until Three Mile Island 22 NNS later . A facility had been built RB to produce plutonium , but when DT NNP successfully designed a nuclear bomb WDT used tritium , DT facility was used to produce PRP for DT UK . However , this required running DT reactor at a higher temperature than its design MD sustain , and PRP eventually caught fire . Operators at first worried IN extinguishing DT flames with NN MD cause a hydrogen explosion , but ultimately gave in and did so as DT crisis escalated . PRP worked , but not before a sizeable amount of radiation had been unleashed into DT surrounding area . A 2007 studyestimated IN DT incident had led to over 200 NNS of cancer in DT surrounding population . DT Stationary Low - Power Reactor Number CD , or SL - 1 , was a nuclear reactor located in DT desert forty miles outside of Idaho Falls , Idaho . On January 3 , 1961 , DT reactor exploded , killing three workers and causing a meltdown . DT cause was a control rod WDT had been withdrawn incorrectly , but even after an investigation WDT took two NNS to complete , DT actions taken by DT workers just prior to DT accident were never discovered . Although DT accident released radioactive material into DT atmosphere , PRP was considered a small amount , and DT reactor ’s remote location helped to minimize damage to DT neighboring population . Still , DT incident is notable for being DT only fatal nuclear reactor accident in NNP history , and for inspiring a NN to DT design of nuclear reactors , so IN a mishap involving a single control rod MD not do this kind of damage . On January 21 , 1968 , a NNP Air Force B - 52 bomber was running a “ Chrome Dome ” mission , a Cold War-era operation in which NNP bombers with nuclear payloads stayed in DT air at all times , all with nearby targets in DT Soviet Union WDT were to be attacked if commanded . DT bomber , which was carrying four hydrogen bombs caught fire . DT nearest emergency landing location was at Thule Air Base in Greenland , but EX was not enough NN to reach PRP , so DT crew abandoned DT bomber . When PRP crashed , DT nuclear payload ruptured and DT area became contaminated with radiation . DT March 2009 issue of NNP magazine classified DT event as CD of DT worst nuclear accidents of all NN . DT 1968 incident caused DT immediate discontinuation of “ Chrome Dome ” missions , and more stable explosives were eventually developed so IN nuclear weapons MD be less likely to explode in an accident . DT Bohunice nuclear power plant was DT first to be built in Czechoslovakia . DT reactor was based on an experimental design WDT was meant to run on uranium mined in Czechoslovakia . However , DT first - of - its - kind facility had multiple accidents , and PRP had to be shut down more than 30 times . Two workers had been killed in a 1976 incident , but DT worst mishap occurred on February 22 , 1977 when a worker removed control rods incorrectly during a routine fuel NN . This simple error caused a massive radioactive leak , and DT ensuing accident earned a level 4 rating on DT International Nuclear Event Scale of 1 to 7 . DT Soviet NN covered up DT accident , so no reliable estimates of casualties have been released to DT NN . However , in 1979 , DT NN decommissioned DT plant , and PRP is expected to be fully dismantled in 2033 ."

For DT , I applaud TrailDust ’s courage , as I believe NOTHING should a priori be ruled beyond DT realm of questioning . This post is my nugget of contribution to TrailDust ’s query . A persistent popular misconception of Hitler and DT Nazis is IN PRP were Christians . Nothing can be further from DT truth . Instead , Hitler and DT Nazis were animated by Nordic paganism and DT occult . DT John Hay Library at Brown University contains a special collection — 81 of Hitler ’s vast 16,000 - volume library . DT whereabouts of most of Hitler ’s books is a mystery , although most scholars believe PRP ’re scattered around Russia . PRP do VB IN 1,200 of them are in DT Library of Congress in Washington , 81 in DT John Hay Library . ( Brown University ) Hitler marked DT margins of his books with vertical lines beside paragraphs or sentences he thought important . According to Timothy Ryback , in his book , Hitler ’s Private Library : DT Books WDT Shaped His Life , CD notable subject represented in DT John Hay Library ’s Hitler collection is DT occult , including a book WDT Hitler had marked — Ernst Schertel ’s Magic : History , Theory and Practice ( 1923 ) . Ryback points to CD marked sentence in Magic as quite chilling , given Hitler ’s history : Some consider Hitler to be demonically possessed . As an example , Jean - Michel Angebert asks in DT Occult and DT Third Reich : DT Mystical Origins of Nazism and DT Search For DT Holy Grail ( pp. 191 and 22 ) : Lewis A. Sumberg , in his “ Translator ’s Preface ” to Angebert ’s volume , pointedly asks ( pp. xii and xiii ) : Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano wrote in his diary : “ I am certain IN even if DT Germans were given more than PRP ask for , PRP MD attack just DT same , because PRP are possessed by DT demon of destruction . ” ( Galeazzo Ciano , DT Ciano Diaries , p. 582 . ) More recently , in an interview with Vatican Radio , DT late Father Gabriel Amorth , Vatican ’s chief exorcist , VBD : “ I am convinced IN DT Nazis were all possessed . All PRP have to do is VB about what Hitler . . . did . Almost certainly PRP were possessed by DT Devil . PRP can tell by their behaviour and their actions , from DT horrors PRP committed and DT atrocities WDT were committed on their orders . ” In fact , Vatican documents revealed IN wartime pontiff Pope Pius XII had attempted a long - distance exorcism of Hitler . But DT effort failed because , as Fr. Amorth explained , DT possessed person must be consenting and willing and in DT presence of DT exorcist for DT demon - banishing to succeed . Those who had known Hitler thought he was demonically possessed . Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels admitted he did not really VB Hitler , although he worked with and saw DT Führer almost every day . Goebbels told his aide - de-camp , Prince Schaumburg - Lippe , IN EX were times when Hitler gave him “ DT chills . ” DT most striking testimony is DT by Hermann Rauschning , a Nazi leader who later fled to DT U.S .

PRP was frightening . He used terms which were strung together in DT strangest way and which were absolutely weird . Then , he again became silent , although his lips continued to move . He was given a massage and something to drink . Then , all of a sudden , he screamed : ‘ RB ! Over RB ! In DT corner ! Who is PRP ? ’ He was jumping up and down , and he was howling . PRP reassured him IN everything was all right , and he gradually calmed down . ”"

When DT NNP NNPS acquired PRP after DT Mexican War ended in 1848 , DT land WDT MD CD day become Colorado was nearly unpopulated by Anglo settlers . Ute , Arapaho , Cheyenne , and other Native Americans had occupied DT land for centuries , but DT Europeans who had made sporadic appearances RB since DT 17th century never stayed for long . PRP was not until 1851 IN DT first permanent non-Indian settlement was established , in DT San Luis Valley . As with JJ other western regions , though , DT lure of gold launched DT first major Anglo invasion . In July 1858 , a band of prospectors working streambeds near modern - day Denver found tiny flecks of gold in their pans . Since DT gold - bearing streams were located in DT foothills not far from DT massive mountain named for DT explorer Zebulon Pike , DT subsequent influx of hopeful miners was termed DT Pike ’s Peak gold rush . By DT spring of 1859 , an estimated 50,000 gold seekers had reached this latest of a long series of American El Dorados . As DT first gold - bearing streams to be discovered played out , prospectors moved westward into DT rugged slopes of DT Rocky Mountains in search of JJ finds . Wherever sizeable deposits were discovered , ramshackle mining camps IN Central City , Nevadaville , and Black Hawk appeared , sometimes almost overnight . Meanwhile , out on DT flat plains at DT edge of DT mountains , Denver became DT central supply town for DT miners . Although few miners came to Colorado planning to stay long , PRP were eager to establish some semblance of “ law and order ” in DT region in order to protect their property rights and gold dust .

Technically lacking in any genuine legal foundation , DT miners ’ courts did maintain DT minimal order needed for DT mineral exploitation of DT territory to continue . DT unreliable mining operations soon gave way to larger , highly capitalized and relatively permanent lode mining operations . DT pioneers recognized IN DT vast mineral resources of DT Rockies MD form DT foundation of a thriving JJ NN , but DT NNS settling RB needed a more formal system of laws and NN . DT Congressional designation of JJ western NNS and territories had been bogged down for several NNS as southern and northern politicians fought over whether slavery MD be permitted in DT JJ western regions .

As reported by CNN and others , DT results of DT NN , which were published in DT Journal of DT American NNP Association ( JAMA ) , reveal IN , rather than evaporate or wash off , sunscreen chemicals persist and accumulate in NNS ’s bodies through their skin , which is DT body ’s largest organ . CDER looked at four common chemicals used in conventional sunscreen products : avobenzone , oxybenzone , ecamsule , and octocrylene . What DT agency found is IN concentrations of three of them continue to rise inside DT body with each subsequent application , and persist RB for at least 24 hours after sunscreen use has ceased . According to DT FDA , these four chemicals , as well as eight others WDT are RB commonly used in JJ sunscreen products , need to be better researched by manufacturers before PRP can receive DT FDA ’s coveted designation of being “ generally regarded as safe and effective . ” “ PRP ’s not NN IN things WDT PRP put on your skin are absorbed into DT body , ” says Scott Faber , senior vice NN for NN affairs at DT Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) , a consumer advocacy group . “ This NN is DT FDA ’s way of showing sunscreen manufacturers PRP need to do DT studies to see if chemical absorption poses NN risks . ” For related NN about DT FDA , be sure to visit FDA .

As PRP MD recall from back in 2007 , PRP published DT Sunscreen Myth , a comprehensive paper and CounterThink cartoon WDT goes into great detail about why DT entire concept behind sunscreen supposedly protecting DT skin against cancer is a myth – and DT fact IN JJ sunscreen products actually cause cancer . DT Sunscreen Myth RB explains how sunscreen chemicals absorb directly through DT skin and immediately enter DT bloodstream , loading NNS ’s bodies with all sorts of synthetic compounds WDT MD or MD not VB effectively detoxified and excreted by DT liver and other cleansing organs . IN cigarette advertising from DT past WDT claimed doctors favored smoking , DT sunscreen hysteria of today is based on little more than fear - mongering and pseudoscience . Truth be told , our bodies need sunlight in order to generate immune - supportive vitamin D – a pro-hormone nutrient WDT ’s effectively blocked by sunscreen . “ EX is no need for sunscreen , but DT cancer industry and sunscreen manufacturers have created a fictitious need through a campaign of fear and disinformation , hypnotizing practically DT entire population into believing CD of DT most ridiculous ideas in DT universe : IN sunlight is bad for human NN , ” explains DT Sunscreen Myth . “ PRP did n’t run and hide from DT sun , PRP used PRP as nourishment to generate a crucial vitamin WDT supports human NN in a multitude of ways .

Occasionally he talked about dreams with his patients or neighbouring peasants . Having overheard their chat , I joined in CD day , saying , “ I dreamed of walking on DT street but I was aware IN I was dreaming . So I was looking for some kind of bed to VB back to sleeping . PRP was a frustrating experience trying to find a bed in DT streets of a village . I finally came to a large dark stone with a smoothly polished flat surface . I fell asleep or out of DT dream even before my body touched DT stone . ” PRP were all surprised by my dream , since lucid dreams are much less common for adults than NNS . In a lucid dream , DT dreamer is aware of DT dreaming status . He or she therefore participates in or even manipulates DT outcome of DT dream . In my case , I wanted to end DT dream , and eventually I did . A false awakening , in which DT dreamer dreamed of getting up to work or to VB to DT washroom , is likely a lucid dream . A daydream MD RB be a lucid dream , if DT dreamer goes far away from his waking NN of mind and is unaware of his physical and social environments . Since a lucid dreamer can often manipulate DT imaginary experiences in DT dream environment , lucid dreams can seem extremely real and vivid , depending on a person ’s level of self - awareness during DT lucid dream . Recently , various techniques have been developed to induce lucid dreams . Such techniques apparently reduce DT frequency and severity of nightmares . Both Buddhism and Taoism have long been known to introduce lucid dream experiences in order to calm down DT believer ’s mind . CD sect of Buddhism goes further to classify DT human mind or consciousness into seven levels of awareness . EX are degrees of wakefulness or awareness , and both lucid dreaming and normal waking experiences lie somewhere towards DT middle of this continuum ( or hierarchy ) of awareness . In this context as DT Buddhist believes , EX are therefore NNS of wakefulness WDT are superior to normal waking awareness , such as Nirvana , which Buddhists pursue in their religious practice . In such superior awareness , DT reality of our ordinary NN becomes illusory . Buddhism holds DT view IN life on NN is bitter in nature . Closing his famous essay All Things Being Equal , Chuang Tzu says , “ Chuang Tzu once dreamed IN he was a butterfly fluttering here and RB , VBG wherever he pleased . He was totally unaware of Chuang Tzu . A sudden awakening left nothing else but Chuang Tzu himself , who did not VB anything about his being a bufferfly . PRP is therefore unknown whether PRP is Chuang Tzu who dreamed of being a bufferfly or if PRP is a butterfly who dreamed of being Chuang Tzu . DT butterfly and Chuang Tzu are completely different entities , and PRP is called transformation when an entity becomes another . ” DT same essay starts with a master who leaned on his armrest while sitting lost himself in meditation . IN Buddhists , Chuang Tzu and his followers apparently mastered DT techniques of lucid dreams . In DT essay , Joyful Free Wandering , Chuang Tzu starts with a legendary bird , Peng , which has a body and wings WDT cover hundreds of miles . PRP can fly three thousand miles high . Even this gigantic bird has to rely on air or wind to fly . PRP is far away from Chuang Tzu ’s joyful free wandering , in which PRP goes to a vivid lucid dream at will , and relying on nothing else but himself . DT dreamer can VB anywhere he pleases . His dreaming experience is so vivid and real IN lucid dreams are not different at all from reality as far as personal experiences are concerned . Buddhism pursues a superior ideal realm , Nirvana , which lies far beyond reality . Taoism holds DT view IN life on NN is so wonderful IN PRP has to be prolonged to eternity . Taoists use lucid dreams to extend their enjoyment of life beyond DT limits of reality . NNS slip into lucid dreams more easily than adults . Similarly prehistoric or primititve NNS have more lucid dreams . Further , Erika Bourguignon , from her NN of almost 500 societies has shown IN DT frequency , accessibility and quality of religious experiences , correlate inversely with DT complexity of social structure . In DT simplest and most egalitarian societies , ritual trance NNS tend to be voluntary , conscious and accessible to most NNS who desire them . Scientifically “ trance ” is often termed as a transformed NN of mind . PRP describes lucid dreams and different levels of awareness in Buddhist terms . Levy - Bruhl ’s book “ Primitive Mentality ” was influential for Julian Jaynes , an American psychologist , who believes IN all humans lived in a hallucinatory NN more than three thousand NNS ago . Levy - Bruhl writes : “ In comparison to modern society , a greater number of individuals in primitive societies experiences hallucinations , experiences them more frequently , and DT hallucinations play an important role in their day - to - day lives . ” Levy - Bruhl VBZ : “ To them DT things which are unseen cannot be distinguished from DT things which are seen . DT beings of DT unseen NN are no less directly present than those of DT other ; PRP are more active and more formidable . Consequently DT NN occupies their minds more entirely than this NN , and PRP diverts their minds from reflecting , even to a slight extent , upon DT data which PRP call objective . ” Both Levy - Bruhl and Erika Bourguignon indicated IN hallucination was more common in ancient primitive NNS . But PRP only employed part of DT idle mind in DT primary society while PRP became DT divine voice , in Julian Jaynes ’ bicameralism , to dictate IN DT NNS should obey their rulers in a secondary society . When rational thinking reflecting on objective data establishes itself in modern society , hallucination or bicameralism remains only in psychotic patients . Buddhism represents a religious tradition based on secondary societies , and so PRP teaches NNS how to retreat from DT traumatizing reality by lucid dreams . Taoism is a religious tradition based on DT primary society , and so PRP teaches NNS how to enjoy life more without any efforts by lucid dreams .

What have ‘ DT JJ elite ’ tried to do in space ? DT truth is JJ NNS are starting to realize IN PRP live in a very sheltered NN , inside a bubble WDT NNS are now trying to desperately pop . PRP ’ve been fed a lot of disinformation about discoveries WDT MD VB DT way PRP view DT very nature of our reality and what PRP means to be human . Discoveries WDT MD have PRP ask DT deep questions about life , our purpose , why PRP are here , and where PRP come from . Discoveries WDT MD literally VB human consciousness forever . “ PRP knew IN DT NNP was flat , PRP knew IN PRP were DT center of DT universe , and PRP knew IN a man -made heavier than air piece of machinery MD not take flight . Through all stages of human history , intellectual authorities have pronounced their supremacy by ridiculing or suppressing elements of reality WDT simply did n’t fit within DT framework of accepted knowledge . Are PRP really any different today ? “ Have PRP really changed our acceptance towards things WDT won’g fit DT frame ? Maybe EX are concepts of our reality PRP have yet to understand , and if PRP open our eyes , maybe PRP will see IN something significant has been overlooked . ” – Terje Toftenes ( source ) This ‘ something ’ significant is DT fact IN PRP are not alone . Whether PRP be a former Chairman of DT Royal Navy telling PRP IN “ EX is a serious possibility IN PRP are being visited , and have been visited by NNS from outer space , ” or an Apollo 14 astronaut saying IN “ EX have been crashed craft , and bodies recovered , ” PRP have no shortage of high - ranking insiders attesting to DT reality IN some UFOs MD be extraterrestrial . EX have been some very interesting leaks over DT NNS WDT suggest DT same thing . General Carlos Cavero told DT NN in 1979 , “ everything ” has been “ in a process of investigation both in DT NNP NNPS and in Spain , as well as DT rest of DT NN . ” On a JJ scale , “ DT nations of DT NN are currently working together in DT investigation of DT UFO phenomenon ” and EX is “ an international exchange of data . ” ( source ) Phobos II was DT last space probe designed by DT Soviet Union to explore DT moons of Mars . Unexpectedly , PRP lost communication with PRP , and multiple insiders have VBN PRP were n’t told DT truth about what really happened . Today , UFOs are no longer taboo . For NNS , PRP ’ve experienced , as I ’ve VBN JJ times before , an “ official campaign of ridicule and secrecy ” ( Ex - CIA Director Roscoe Hillenkoetter ) of DT phenomenon . DT establishment in JJ ways was responsible for DT foolish articles WDT MD constantly appear in mainstream NN publications , absolutely ridiculing a topic WDT is actually very real . But DT tables have now turned . CD of DT biggest mouthpieces for “ DT establishment , ” DT NNP York Times , admitted something WDT DT establishment , or facets of PRP , have been concealing for NNS : UFOs are real . A former high - ranking federal NN employee , Christopher Mellon , RB wrote a Washington post article WDT detailed a number of UFO encounters with DT military with extreme credibility . But again , this is n’t JJ information . In DT 1950s , NNP Harry Truman went on national television announcing to DT NN IN UFOs are real , and IN PRP discuss DT topic at every conference WDT PRP have with DT military , IN “ EX ’s always things IN DT VBG on , flying saucers and PRP ’ve had other things . ” ( source ) Official pictures and videos have RB been released , for example , a photo taken by two Royal Canadian Air Force pilots on August 27th , 1956 in McCleod , Alberta , Canada is a great example . ( “ Physical Evidence Related To UFO Reports ” – DT Sturrock Panel Report – Electromagnetic Effects ) ( source ) ( source ) PRP can see DT picture here . In this case , DT pilots were flying in a formation of four F86 Sabre jet aircraft . CD of DT pilots described DT phenomenon as a “ bright light which was sharply defined as disk - shaped ” WDT looked IN “ a shiny silver dollar sitting horizontal . ” Another pilot managed to photograph DT object , as PRP can see above . DT NNP Navy has acknowledged footage showing multiple UFOs WDT was released a couple of NNS ago by To DT Stars Academy via DT Pentagon , and PRP ’ve recently confirmed IN DT videos are indeed real . EX are millions of pages of documents to VB through , and thousands of statements from high ranking NNS WDT have been attesting to DT UFO / extraterrestrial phenomenon for a very long NN . DT being VBN , DT topic is VBG ‘ mainstream ’ and PRP ’s always important to note IN DT establishment , and NN outlets IN DT NNP York Times , CNN etc have been intelligence agency mouthpieces . PRP have fed DT NN a lot of disinformation and DT type of controlled disclosure PRP are seeing on this subject is probably no different . EX is much more VBG on than what PRP VBP from DT mainstream – PRP always try to control DT narrative for their own selfish purposes . PRP ’s always important to keep DT in mind for anybody who delves deep into this subject . Are PRP trying to control DT narrative and spread more disinformation ? Are PRP trying to present a threat narrative in order to justify certain measures ? Similar to how ‘ terrorism ’ was used and financed by DT west to justify DT infiltration and takeover of other NNS in order to bring them ‘ democracy ? ’ These are important questions to ask ourselves as this topic gains more popularity . What is presented by DT mainstream is far from DT available truth WDT ’s already out RB ."

He now lives in Medway , Kent . Having released two solo albums , Turner formed DT band Stuart Turner & DT Flat NNP Society , who release their 5th album Scowl in DT summer of 2017 . Though being an active musician for a number of NNS , and playing with a number of different local musicians , Turner 's first official solo release came on Sun Pier Records , a Chatham based record label distributed by Cargo , and formed by friend and fellow musician Kris Dollimore , ex-guitarist with DT Damned . Turner produced Dollimore 's debut Sun Pier release ( 02/01/1978 ) in 2006 , writing a song on PRP ( "" DT North Kent Post Industrial Hillstomp Blues "" ) which received national airplay on BBC Radio Two . Turner 's own solo appeared a few months later with his debut album , A Gallon of NNP Makes a Mile of Fog , which CD critic described as "" packed full of ideas "" . [ 2 ] Turner supported Dollimore in gigs around England and spent 2006 and 2007 playing shows in a diverse selection of venues , including bowling alleys , cabaret clubs and Swedish festivals , which CD reviewer described as "" scaring DT living daylights out of DT assembled crowd with his spooky folk blues "" . [ 3 ] Turner 's second album , File Under Carnal Knowledge , was described a freight train riding back bar room down at heel blues "" , [ 4 ] and released on Sun Pier in February 2009 . Turner formed DT Flat NNP Society with guitarist Robbie Wilkinson in 2009 to record what became DT band 's first album Gin & Bitters . Alongside Turner and Wilkinson in DT original line - up were Ray Hunt on drums and Dave Sawicki on bass ( with occasional trumpet from John Whitaker ) . DT album was released on CD and digital download in July 2010 , through DT independent Brigadier Records . DT band added "" steam driven power "" to his "" anguished urban blues "" , [ 5 ] and provided DT opportunity for live performances around DT South East of England , including DT Lounge On DT Farm festival . Turner & DT Flat NNP Society performed gigs to DT end of 2010 , including a Christmas ball at Oxford University . A live version of "" Murder On Gaslight Street "" was made available for free download via Medway Eyes in October 2010 , whilst Brigadier Records released DT Gin & Bitters album tracks , "" Shimmy "" and "" South NNP Blues "" as radio promos in December DT NN . Gin & Bitters was followed up with DT limited vinyl EP release Weekend Hearts in 2011 before DT band recorded On DT Brink Of Misadventure , which was their final album release with Brigadier Records . At this point , DT band underwent some line - up changes , with a JJ line - up containing Turner , Wilkinson , Nick Rice ( bass ) , Bob Collins ( guitarist formerly with DT Dentists ) , Rob Shepherd ( from DT Singing Loins on banjo , mandolin and accordion ) and James Kerr recording a JJ album during 2013 . At this point , DT band began their association with Vacilando ' 68 Recordings in Autumn of 2013 and acquired publishing through Bucks Music Publishing . DT JJ album , DT Art and NNP of Phrenology : a presentation by Stuart Turner and DT Flat NNP Society was released by Vacilando ' 68 in February 2014 . Steve Moore replaced James Kerr as drummer in NN for a JJ EP , DT Gentleman 's Club , released by Vacilando ' 68 in October 2014 . Whilst recording what MD become DT band 's 4th album , DT band gigged extensively around DT South East and London and started to make in - roads into DT grass roots festival circuit , with an appearance at 2015 's Bearded Theory festival a particular highlight . DT 4th album , eponymously named , was released to critical acclaim by Vacilando ' 68 in April 2016 following a long period of artwork and pressing delays . DT band had a two - page feature in Maverick Magazine . With Mike Sewell replacing Steve Moore on drums , DT band recorded their 5th album , to be released as Scowl in 2017 . DT album RB features guest appearances from Rachel Lowrie and David Read ( of DT Claim ) . Some left - over songs from DT album were released as a digital only release in February 2017 . • On DT Brink Of Misadventure ( 2012 , Brigadier ) • DT Art and NNP of Phrenology : a presentation by Stuart Turner and DT Flat NNP Society ( February 2014 , Vacilando ' 68 )"

If_IN we_PRP lose_VBP that_DT ,_, we_PRP 're_VBP all_RB in_IN trouble_NN ._.","Nick Davies is a distinguished reporter who specialises in very long and depressing stories for DT Guardian on subjects most other journalists prefer to leave untouched , such as poverty and DT failings of DT criminal justice system . He has now turned his virtuous investigative eye on his own profession . His reaction is almost spinsterish in its horror . Davies ' notion of what journalists and journalism are for is idiosyncratic , to put PRP mildly . Whoever told him IN this is an industry ' supposedly dedicated ' - as he puts PRP in his prologue - ' to telling DT truth ' ? Where did he VB DT idea IN journalists should be , or ever have been , reluctant to lie , cheat , deceive and resort to low tricks of every kind ? In this survey of what he calls ' a corrupted profession ' , he hardly bothers with DT tabloids . ' No NN needs a book to tell them IN DT tabloids are an unreliable source of information about DT NN , ' he comments with lordly condescension . Sheltered from DT rough NN of daily hackery , he RB disdains what he sees as DT fictions of objectivity and neutrality . Journalists , Davies believes , must make judgments ; DT strong implication is IN these should be between good and bad . Much of his analysis is nevertheless compelling and alarming . On provincial papers , pitifully underpaid journalists spend their days rewriting press releases , while DT proceedings in courts and councils VBP largely unreported . At all levels , DT relentless pressure on staffing , combined with DT demand for more and yet more ' NN ' , have created a culture of dependence . Journalists with no NN either to find stories or to check DT information PRP are given , are reduced to processing DT unstoppable flow of material from DT PR departments , DT special interest groups , DT pseudo - experts , DT pseudo - researchers . Davies convincingly chronicles DT success of DT CIA and MI6 in planting fictions across DT supposedly independent NN to VB backing for false assessments of DT dangers posed by Iraq and Iran . He argues IN Greenpeace and other eco groups have been just as eager as DT fossil - fuel lobby to distort and exaggerate DT available NN on JJ NN to further their own ends ( although , curiously enough , Davies omits any reference to DT willingness of his own newspaper to swallow DT most extreme predictions of DT coming catastrophe with scarcely a flicker of scepticism ) . His last three chapters focus on DT Sunday Times , DT Observer , and DT Daily Mail ( DT Sunday Telegraph does not draw Davies 's fire ) . PRP comes as little surprise to find IN DT Mail is prejudiced against blacks , homosexuals , immigrants , lefties , NNS on benefit and so on , and IN PRP is unscrupulous in mobilising its money and power to hound them ; or IN Davies laments DT passing of DT old investigative tradition on DT Sunday Times . But his assault on DT Observer is something else . In DT eyes of Guardian men IN Nick Davies , their sister paper DT Observer and its then editor , Roger Alton , committed an unforgivable offence in declaring support for DT Iraq war . Davies directs a venomous attack on DT integrity and professional competence of Alton and his political editor , Kamal Ahmed . He portrays them as puppets of Alastair Campbell and Tony Blair , intent on turning DT paper into a mouthpiece for DT NN 's war policy , ready to suppress or bury any story WDT might raise doubts about Saddam Hussein 's alleged arsenal . Of Alton , Davies says : ' His passions are far from NN , much closer to sport and women , both of whom he pursues with obsessive NN ' - a comment so unpleasant IN PRP begins to suspect some ancient personal grudge . Davies deliberately underplays DT extent to which Alton was prepared to allow NN and space to DT expression of anti-war sentiment ; and ignores altogether DT persistence with which DT Observer criticised Blair and his ministers over their domestic record , and exposed their bullying , lies and deceptions . If this travesty of what happened at DT Observer represents Nick Davies 's idea of good journalism , he can keep PRP . Let 's be charitable and regard PRP as an aberration , and concentrate instead on DT valuable and disturbing insights WDT Davies provides into a business WDT needs to ask a good JJ questions of itself . No NN should expect journalists to be as high - minded as Nick Davies . Theirs is - or should be - a murky , occasionally mucky , job done by NNS short on scruples and long on curiosity , suspicious of everything and everybody , and of favours most of all . Journalists do n't need to be clean but PRP must be allowed to VB DT story , and PRP must have DT confidence and courage to write PRP as PRP see PRP . If PRP lose DT , PRP 're all in trouble ."

Hamilton : DT 9/11 Commission was created by statute . PRP had two responsibilities – first , tell DT story of 9/11 ; I VBP PRP ’ve done DT reasonably well . PRP worked very hard at PRP ; I do n’t VB IN PRP ’ve told DT definitive story of 9/11 , but surely anybody in DT future who tackles DT job will begin with DT 9/11 Commission Report . I VBP PRP ’ve been reasonably successful in telling DT story . PRP became a best seller in this country and NNS showed a lot of interest in PRP . Our second task was to make recommendations ; thus far , about half of our recommendations have been enacted into law , DT other half have not been enacted . So PRP ’ve got a ways to VB . In a quantitative sense , PRP ’ve had about 50 % success RB . In a qualitative sense , PRP MD judge PRP JJ different ways . But PRP still have some very important recommendations WDT PRP VBP have not yet been enacted WDT should be . Solomon : Now , CD of DT stipulations , PRP write in DT book , CD of DT ways WDT PRP thought IN this ought to be successful , this report , DT Commission Report , is on page 23 , PRP VBD if DT American NNS MD accept DT results as authoritative , and DT recommendations . And when I measure DT against a Zogby poll done in NNP , DT says now 42 % of Americans say IN “ DT U.S. NN , and its 9/11 Commission , concealed or refused to investigate critical evidence WDT contradicts DT official explanation of September 11th , saying EX ’s a cover - up ” – 42 % , Mr. Hamilton – what does DT say to PRP about DT efficacy of DT Commission ’s report ? Hamilton : Well , PRP ’s dispiriting , PRP ’s an unusually high number , but if PRP look at polls judging NN reports in DT past – DT Warren Commission , DT reports on Kennedy assassination , even DT reports on Abraham Lincoln ’s assassination – PRP find a very high level of NNS who are skeptical . And PRP have DT in this case . When PRP conduct a major investigation , PRP cannot possibly answer every question , PRP just do DT best PRP can . But for every question PRP leave unanswered , PRP create an opening to a NN theory , and a good JJ of them have popped up here . DT only thing I ask in DT future is IN DT NN theory NNS do not apply a double standard . DT is to say , PRP VBP PRP to make an airtight case for any assertion PRP make . On DT other hand , when PRP make an assertion PRP do PRP often on very flimsy evidence . But conspirators are always VBG to exist in this country . Tom Kean and I got a flavour of this everytime PRP ’d walk through an audience – PRP MD hand PRP notes , hand PRP papers , hand PRP books , hand PRP tapes , telling PRP to investigate this , DT or DT other . PRP cannot possibly answer all these questions , PRP just do DT best PRP can . Solomon : Some of DT families have joined DT chorus . PRP ’ve talked to CD father who says , ‘ my son was killed by George W. Bush ’ , as if DT NN had foreknowledge of DT attacks . What MD PRP say to someone IN him and other family members who have been dissatisfied with DT explanation ? Hamilton : JJ families supported DT report – very strongly – and have been instrumental in helping PRP on DT implementation stage . A lot of DT NNS WDT have doubts about DT report – not all of them – are strongly anti-Bush , for a variety of reasons . JJ of them are just anti-government , in other words , PRP do n’t believe anything DT NN says . All I ask of these NNS is : give me your evidence . If PRP thought George Bush or Lee Hamilton or Tom Kean blew up those buildings , let ’s see DT evidence . Solomon : I MD n’t mind just .. EX ’s a few things , but I VBP to VB , interestingly enough , if PRP ’ve seen a film WDT ’s so popular now on DT internet , ten million NNS apparently have seen a film called Loose NNP , which makes some startling allegations . PRP ’s a film made by three very young students out of a NNP York University . Have PRP seen DT movie , and if so , what are your thoughts on PRP ? Hamilton : I have not seen PRP . Solomon : Yeah … 10 million NNS , I mean , some of them .. now , and PRP ’s interesting IN PRP write in CD of your chapters , I VBP PRP ’s Chapter 12 , deals specifically with NN theories . CD of them , as PRP VBP – probably CD of DT most persistent – is IN DT buildings were brought down by controlled explosion , controlled demolition . CD of DT bits of evidence WDT is often cited is DT collapse of NNP Trade Center Building Number 7 , which was not hit by any plane . CD question WDT NNS have is : why did n’t DT Commission deal with DT collapse Building 7 , which some call DT smoking gun ? Why did this collapse at all ? Hamilton : Well , of course , PRP did deal with PRP . DT charge IN dynamite , or whatever , brought down DT NNP Trade Towers , PRP of course looked at very carefully – PRP find no evidence of DT . PRP find all kinds of evidence IN PRP was DT airplanes WDT did PRP . Do n’t take our word on DT : DT engineers and DT architects have studied this thing in extraordinary detail , and PRP can tell PRP precisely what caused DT collapse of those buildings . What caused DT collapse of DT buildings , to summarize PRP , was IN DT super - heated jet fuel melted DT steel super - structure of these buildings and caused their collapse . EX ’s a powerful lot of evidence to sustain DT point of view , including DT pictures of DT airplanes flying into DT building . Now , with regard to Building 7 , PRP believe IN PRP was DT aftershocks of these two huge buildings in DT very near vicinity collapsing . And in DT Building 7 case , PRP VBP IN PRP was a case of flames setting off a fuel container , which started DT fire in Building 7 , and DT was our theory on Building 7 . Now PRP ’re not DT experts on this , PRP talked to DT engineers and DT architects about this at some length , and DT ’s DT conclusion PRP reached . Solomon : Let me just ask PRP CD more question on DT . CD counter - argument – or EX ’s two , I guess – CD is IN DT fire very rarely , and has never , forced buildings constructed IN DT NNP Trade Centers to ever collapse , because steel does n’t melt at temperatures WDT can be reached through a hydro - carbon fire , and IN EX ’s other .. in other words , EX are countless NNS of other buildings WDT have been on fire WDT have not collapsed . Hamilton : – but not on fire through jet fuel , I do n’t VB PRP have any evidence of DT . But here again , I ’m not DT expert on PRP . PRP relied on DT experts , and PRP ’re DT engineers and DT architects who examined this in very great detail . Solomon : A question which has remained : Why did DT debris of NNP Trade Center 7 , of which nobody died RB , so EX was no real urgency to move DT debris away , and IN EX have been questions : why was n’t PRP examined closer ? Why was essentially evidence from what MD have been a crime scene – or was a crime scene – removed very quickly from RB ? Hamilton : PRP ca n’t answer every question when PRP conduct an investigation . Look , PRP ’ve to got to remember IN on this day , chaos and confusion were DT mark , and peoples ’ overwhelming concern was to try to save as JJ lives as possible , not to explain why a particular building collapsed . So PRP ’s not unusual to me IN PRP , and DT Commission – and anybody else , for DT matter – cannot answer every question . I VBP back to what I say earlier : whenever PRP conduct an investigation , PRP cannot answer every question . Solomon : But should DT Commission have .. I guess DT question some NNS keep asking , should DT Commission have asked more questions about DT removal of DT debris ? Hamilton : Look , PRP can say IN about almost every phase of our investigation , ‘ PRP should have asked this , PRP should have asked DT , PRP should have spent more NN ’ – PRP ’re conducting an investigation , PRP have a NN limit , PRP do n’t have unlimited NN , PRP have a budget limit , PRP cannot VB down every track , PRP cannot answer conclusively every question . DT members of DT families WDT PRP referred to a minute ago submitted 150 questions to PRP – PRP answered a good JJ of them , PRP did n’t answer them all . PRP come to a point in an investigation where PRP have to say to yourself , ‘ what ’s our responsibility , given DT resources PRP have , how much can PRP do ? ’ And PRP end up with a lot of questions unanswered . Look , I ‘ve got a lot of unanswered questions in my mind . Solomon : What are yours ? What are your unanswered questions ? Hamilton : Well , at DT top of my list happens to be a personal NN , and DT is , I MD never figure out why these CD fellas did what PRP did . PRP looked into their backgrounds . In CD or two NNS , PRP were apparently happy , well - adjusted , not particularly religious – in CD case quite well - to - do , had a girlfriend . PRP just MD n’t figure out why he did PRP . I still do n’t VB . And I VBP CD of DT great unanswered questions – a good topic for investigative reporters – MD be : why did these CD do what PRP did ? PRP speculated in DT report about why DT enemy hates PRP , but PRP simply were n’t able to answer DT questions about DT CD . Solomon : PRP VBP , just on DT point , and again , EX are so JJ of these questions about DT CD . EX have been some questions about – and I ’m talking about sources here IN DT London Times and Le Figaro , sort of major newspapers – IN some of these guys , some of these hijackers were still alive after DT day of DT event , IN EX are reports of their whereabouts . What did DT Commission make of those kind of reports ? Hamilton : ( Laughs ) What ’s DT evidence ? Look , I had a woman come up to me who VBD she was a lover of Mohammed Atta . And I VBD , ‘ do PRP VB IN he ’s dead ? ’ And she VBD , ‘ I ’m his lover . ’ .. ( raises eyebrows ) PRP VBP all kinds of comments IN this , PRP ca n’t trace everything down . Solomon : Where EX any notion EX was … DT NTSB recently released DT flight path of NNP Flight 93 in DT past two weeks . CD of DT interesting things WDT WDT showed was , during DT flight path , and I VBP DT flight path of DT , I VBP IN plane crashed , according to DT Report , at 10:03 am . And CD of DT interesting things PRP showed – this is just recently declassified – IN PRP flew well over 10,000 feet – 30,000 , 40,000 feet – from about 9:30 onward . Now , a lot of DT cell phone calls WDT were made from DT plane , WDT ended up being in DT movie , were from , PRP VBP , NNS phoning from DT plane . And CD allegation WDT ’s recently come out since DT release of DT is : cell phones do n’t work above 10,000 feet , so how MD NNS VB on their cell phone on a plane and phone their relatives ? Hamilton : I ’m no expert on DT . I ’ve been told cell phones work – sometimes – above 10,000 feet , and as high as 30,000 feet . So PRP MD have been IN some of DT calls went through and some did n’t , I just do n’t VB . Solomon : Let me ask PRP another thing . I ’m just asking because , PRP VBP , in DT wake of this , EX ’s lots of these questions . Solomon : DT Lamont Doherty NNP Observatory at Columbia University , which is about 20 odd miles away from NNP York , PRP released a report on seismic data coming from Manhattan on DT day . And PRP released a spike in seismic data at 8:46:26 , and PRP thought DT was DT moment of impact of DT plane on DT first NNP Trade Center , of American Airlines 11 . But DT plane did n’t hit until 8:46:40 , and EX are several of DT same kind of early seismic spikes for DT second flight . I guess DT question is : how do PRP explain those discrepancies ? When DT NN looks at DT , how can PRP explain DT kind of thing ? Hamilton : I have n’t seen DT report . I do n’t VB DT answer to your question . PRP did n’t come forward with DT evidence while PRP were at DT Commission – so far as I VBP . Now , staff filtered a lot of these things , so not necessarily MD I VB . I do n’t VB what happened with regard to the… . What did PRP conclude ? I do n’t VB what PRP concluded . Solomon : PRP had no conclusion ; DT evidence is sitting out RB . PRP write about , in Chapter 12 of DT book – and again PRP ’s CD of those allegations WDT have come up – about who had foreknowledge of PRP ? CD piece of evidence WDT JJ critics have VBN is : ‘ well , EX is lots of ‘ puts ’ – which is a form of financial stock trading . In other words , NNS are buying up stock , hoping IN DT airline stock MD plunge , and EX was an unusually large number of puts on American Airlines and NNP stock , and therefore NNS profited from this . What did PRP make of DT theory ? Hamilton : DT ’s CD PRP did investigate . PRP looked at DT pretty carefully , and all I can indicate at this point is IN PRP do not VB anybody profited from manipulation of airline stock prior to 9/11 , EX ’s no evidence of DT , I do n’t VB . Hamilton : DT ’s correct . PRP ’s not unusual in DT stock market to have a lot of activity in a given stock , or industry , as PRP did here . DT question is : did any of them have foreknowledge and profit from PRP ? PRP do n’t VB so ; PRP looked at PRP pretty carefully . Solomon : EX ’s RB allegations IN DT Pakistani Secret Service , called DT ISI , DT head of which met here in DT NNP NNPS right before 9/11 , and EX ’s some allegations and evidence to show IN PRP paid Mohammed Atta $ 100,000 . DT reason this is important is : who funded DT NNS who conducted DT attacks , DT terrorist attacks ? What did DT Commission make of payment from DT ISI to Mohammed Atta of $ 100,000 ? Hamilton : I do n’t VB anything about PRP . Solomon : Was EX any connection between .. Did DT Commission investigate any connection between ISI , Pakistani intelligence , and .. Hamilton : PRP MD have ; I do not recall PRP writing anything about PRP in DT report . PRP MD have but I do n’t recall PRP . PRP did estimate IN Osama bin Laden spent about $ 500,000 for DT 9/11 attacks . PRP did not identify all DT sources of DT money . Solomon : And how PRP got to DT … Hamilton : DT ’s right , PRP simply can’t trace PRP , so far as I VBP , because $ 500,000 in international financial markets is not even a blip on DT radar screen . So PRP do not VB precisely where DT money came from . Solomon : Questions about foreknowledge , especially as to when Vice NNP Dick Cheney knew when he went down to DT protective bunker : EX was some suggestion IN DT Secretary of Transport Mineta testified in front of DT Commission IN he in fact talked to Dick Cheney at 9:20 am . Cheney claims he had n’t been RB .. gotten down RB until close to 10 am . DT was eventually omitted from DT final report , . Can PRP tell PRP a bit about about what Secretary of Transport Mineta told DT Commission about where Dick Cheney was prior to 10 am ? Solomon : And PRP do n’t VB exactly where DT .. Hamilton : Well , PRP VBP IN Vice NNP Cheney entered DT bunker shortly before 10 o’clock . And EX is a gap of several minutes RB , where PRP do not really VB what DT Vice NNP really did . EX is DT famous phone call between DT NNP and DT Vice NNP . PRP MD find no documentary evidence of DT phone call . Both DT NNP and DT Vice NNP VBD IN DT phone call was made , and in DT phone call , DT order was supposedly was given , allegedly given , to shoot down an airliner – if necessary Now , EX are a lot of things not answered about DT period of NN . DT order never got to DT pilots and when PRP did VB to DT pilots , PRP did n’t VB to them in NN , and when PRP did VB to them , PRP claimed PRP was not an order to shoot PRP down , but to identify and track an airliner , not to shoot PRP down . What PRP had on this day , of course , was a lot of confusion , and a lot of confusion in communications , at DT very highest levels . When DT NNP went from DT school in Sarasota to Air Force CD , he was trying to VB communications with DT White House , he used a cell phone , in part . When he got to Air Force CD , DT communications did n’t work all RB well . Well , this is all very disturbing , and I ’m told has now been corrected . Solomon : Disturbing in what way ? Hamilton : Well , disturbing IN , at this particular NN , DT Commander in Chief lost communications with DT White House , and with his chief aides RB , right in DT middle of a crisis – DT ’s very disturbing . I hope DT ’s been corrected , I ’ve been told IN PRP has been . But DT fact of DT matter is , if PRP look at 9/11 , all DT way through , FAA communications , NORAD communications , White House communications , EX was just a lot of confusion , and a lot of gaps . Solomon : So , just in terms of Mineta , just because I VBP DT ’s sort of interesting , when Secretary Mineta made at your Commission hearing , I VBP he did this NNP 23rd , IN he arrived and talked to Dick Cheney at 9:20 – WDT MD show IN Mr. Cheney had had some earlier knowledge IN planes had been hijacked and PRP wanted to take action . DT was not – Hamilton : What did DT Secretary say at DT NN to DT Vice NNP ? Solomon : PRP talked about a plane being hijacked , according to DT testimony WDT I ’ve seen , according to DT Mineta report . But EX ’s another NN , in Richard Clarke ’s book , “ Against All Enemies ” , and I VBP Richard Clarke took DT stand very famously – not DT stand , but testified before DT Commission very famously – he says he received authorization from Dick Cheney to shoot down Flight 93 at about 9:50 am . In DT Commission ’s Report , PRP VBD DT authorization did n’t come from Dick Cheney until 10:25 , and Richard Clarke ’s testimony IN he and his book , is n’t mentioned in DT Commission ’s .. Why did n’t PRP mention DT ? Hamilton : Look , PRP ’ve obviously gone through DT report with a fine - toothed comb , PRP ’re raising a lot of questions – I can do DT same thing … Hamilton : .. all I VBP from PRP is evidence . PRP ’re just citing a lot of things , without any evidence to back them up , as far as I can see . Solomon : No , I ’m just asking why PRP were n’t – Hamilton : I do n’t VB DT answer to your question . Solomon : I guess part of DT reason is .. Hamilton : I cannot answer every question with regard to 9/11 . I can answer a good JJ of them , but I ca n’t answer them all . Solomon : I guess , Mr. Hamilton , I do n’t VB anyone expects PRP to have all DT answers … Hamilton : Well , PRP apparently do , because PRP have asked me questions of enormous detail from a great variety of sources . PRP VBP me to answer them all – I ca n’t do PRP ( laughs ) Solomon : I guess part of DT reason is I VBP to VB , not necessarily what DT answer is , but if DT Commission considered , PRP VBP , what made PRP into DT report , in terms of DT discussion . And of course , what PRP ’re trying to understand is , if DT commission simply VBD ‘ PRP VBP , those kinds … EX was huge amounts of data , and PRP MD n’t put everything in ’ . So I guess , PRP VBP , in questions about what happened on 9/11 as PRP approach DT fifth anniversary of DT day , and this being DT kind of most extensive document WDT DT NN has , EX are questions as to what made PRP in and what PRP heard , and what PRP did n’t . And DT , I VBP , those are DT nature of DT questions . Hamilton : Yeah . A lot of things WDT came to DT attention of staff did not come to DT attention of DT Commission . Some of DT things did come to DT attention of DT Commission , and PRP did n’t put ’em in , or at least PRP put ’em in at a lower level . But JJ of DT things did not come directly to my attention . Solomon : Part of what PRP write in DT book is IN CD of DT key goals here was to be as transparent and as open as possible , because PRP say ‘ without light , DT NN theorists jump in . ’ Solomon : Now , CD place WDT PRP shed a lot of light on – and PRP write about PRP in this book [ “ Without Precedent ” ] as well – is a place where NN theorists , as PRP call them , have jumped in , which is DT plane WDT hit DT Pentagon . As PRP and I both VBP , EX ’s a number of publications WDT [ say ] DT hole in DT Pentagon was too small to accomodate a plane of DT , PRP VBP , 125 foot wingspan , 40 feet high , and IN PRP was a missile . What did PRP make – what did DT Commission , when PRP heard all those kind of ideas , how did PRP consider those , and what investigation went on around those ? Hamilton : Well , PRP VBD an airplane went into DT Pentagon . And PRP VBD IN jet fuel RB too caused an awful lot of DT damage and DT injury . PRP had CD member of DT staff who had been badly , badly burned by jet fuel , and as PRP VBP , jet fuel causes specific kinds of burns , and these burns were from jet fuel . So all of our evidence indicated a plane went in , and DT ’s what DT eyewitnesses VBD WDT PRP saw . Solomon : And PRP VBP , this notion – and this is maybe CD of DT most popular theories , and PRP see PRP all over – is IN reports initially came back from DT Pentagon IN EX was no debris at all , IN DT plane simply disintegrated inside DT Pentagon . To those NNS , those of PRP who have seen aviation accidents , WDT sounded in some ways difficult to believe , because EX was such a huge plane , and DT maneuvre WDT PRP MD require DT pilot to make MD have been , PRP VBP , to fly into PRP seemed so astonishing . What did DT commission make of DT debate , such as PRP is , DT surrounds DT ? Hamilton : PRP thought PRP was an airplane Solomon : Was EX any debris ? Hamilton : My recollection is , DT answer ’s yes . Was EX a lot of debris ? I do n’t VB so . To say IN EX was no debris strains my recollection , I did n’t remember PRP DT way , I thought EX was some debris . But PRP VBP , PRP have relatively little experience with planes highly loaded with jet fuel crashing , ( chuckles ) and reconstructing exactly what happened on DT basis of DT crash . PRP did DT best PRP MD on PRP . PRP thought PRP was an airplane . EX were a number of eyewitnesses , of course , who saw DT plane VB into DT Pentagon , a number of NNS , for example , who were driving on DT roadway – I forget DT number of PRP right now – who had DT airplane fly over their cars into DT building , and PRP stopped their car , and saw DT plane VBG into DT Pentagon – DT was not CD , DT was a number of eyewitnesses . PRP relied upon DT , of course . Solomon : And PRP VBP , when PRP .. PRP ’ve spoken with JJ of DT witnesses , your Commission heard testimony from all sorts of different NNS . So when PRP hear these kind of ongoing allegations IN EX was conflicting reports of DT witnesses ; IN DT FBI confiscated tapes from DT gas station across DT road , WDT supposedly saw PRP within a day of PRP ; IN some of those witnesses disappeared .. what do PRP make of those kind of … Hamilton : I do n’t believe for a minute IN PRP got everything right . PRP wrote a first draft of history . PRP wrote PRP under a lot of NN pressure , and PRP sorted through DT evidence as best PRP MD . Now , PRP MD be really rather remarkable if PRP got everything right . So far , of DT things WDT have been brought up challenging DT report , to my knowledge , PRP have more credibility than DT challenger . But I MD not for a moment VB to suggest IN DT ’s always true , either in DT past or in DT future . NNS will be investigating 9/11 for DT next hundred NNS in this country , and PRP ’re VBG to find out some things WDT PRP missed here . So I do n’t automatically reject all DT evidence PRP cite . PRP MD be PRP missed PRP , PRP MD be PRP ignored PRP when PRP should n’t have – I do n’t VB PRP did , but PRP ’s possible . Solomon : PRP write .. DT first chapter of DT book is ‘ DT Commission was set up to fail . ’ – my goodness , for DT critics – who suggest IN PRP was indeed set up to fail as some kind of obfuscation – PRP certainly dangled a juicy piece of bait out RB in DT river . Why do PRP VB PRP were set up to fail ? Hamilton : Well , for a number of reasons : Tom Kean and I were substitutes – Henry Kissinger and George Mitchell were DT first choices ; PRP got started late ; PRP had a very short NN frame – indeed , PRP had to VB PRP extended ; PRP did not have enough money – 3 million dollars to conduct an extensive investigation . PRP needed more , PRP got more , but PRP took PRP a while to VB PRP . PRP had a lot of skeptics out RB , who really did not VB DT Commission formed . Politicians do n’t VB somebody looking back to see if PRP made a mistake . DT Commission had to report right , just a few days before DT Democratic National Convention met , in other words , right in DT middle of a political campaign . PRP had a lot of NNS strongly opposed to what PRP did . PRP had a lot of trouble getting access to documents and to NNS . PRP knew DT history of commissions ; DT history of commissions were PRP .. nobody paid much attention to ’em . So EX were all kinds of reasons PRP thought PRP were set up to fail . PRP decided IN if PRP were VBG to have any success , PRP had to have a unanimous report , otherwise DT Commission report MD simply be filed . Solomon : I guess DT question is , PRP VBP , if forty odd million dollars were spent investigating NNP Bill NNP ’s sexual infidelities , why did DT American NNS and DT NN have to wait 441 days for a commission WDT was originally budgeted for 3 million dollars and given barely a NN , and as PRP write in DT book and document so well , was … had to fight to VB access to even use its subpoena power very judiciously , for fear IN EX ’d be a backlash against DT Commission . I mean , an event as cataclysmic as 9/11 , PRP begs DT question : why was DT administration so unwilling to budget this thing , and then Congress so unwilling to give money and let PRP guys VB whole hog to do more ? Hamilton : ( Laughs ) I VBP basically PRP ’s because PRP were afraid PRP were VBG to hang somebody , IN PRP MD point DT finger , right in DT middle of a presidential campaign – ‘ Mr. Bush , this was your fault ’ – or even Mr. NNP . NNP NNP was wary about this report too . Now I VBP to say , eventurally both presidents cooperated , but PRP took a while . And PRP ’s not too unusual for me to understand IN PRP were skeptical . A commission WDT is created does not have automatic credibility – PRP had to work at DT , PRP had to produce a lot of reports which were recognized , fortunately , to be professionally done , seriously done – and not out to hang anybody . Solomon : Sorry , but why not out to hang anybody ? This idea , ‘ PRP did n’t VB to point fingers ’ , IN PRP were n’t out to ‘ hang anybody ’.. Good God , I thought DT families were saying , ‘ let ’s find out not just what happened , but who is accountable ’ – PRP VBP , DT famous testimony of Richard Clarke , in front of your commission , when he VBD , “ I failed PRP . ” Were n’t NNS wanting PRP to point fingers and make someone accountable ? Hamilton : Yes I VBP PRP were . And PRP say , in DT book , IN EX was a thirst for accountability . Now , part of DT thirst was just to tell DT story . This traumatic event occurs and PRP wanted to understand why PRP occurred , and PRP tried to tell DT as best PRP MD . NN ’s not very good at looking back and criticizing itself , and CD of DT things WDT impressed PRP over and over again , as PRP talked to CD agency after DT other , is : PRP had not really met and turned this over in their mind ; NN is always operating on DT Inbox , and PRP were critical of almost every agency , in not looking back and asking what went wrong . So I VBP DT ’s a powerful factor in NN , and … Solomon : PRP does RB suggest – I mean , EX is DT factor – but PRP VBP , what DT NN often .. now , and again , I talk about DT 9/11 families , who were so instrumental in getting DT Commission VBG .. Solomon : PRP VBD , ‘ listen , is CD of DT reasons PRP ’re not getting funded , and PRP ’s so late , is IN someone ’s got something to hide . Hamilton : EX is … well , a lot of NNS have things to hide . Solomon : Well who in this case ? Hamilton : Look , PRP can VB down DT list and probably identify a hundred NNS who made mistakes WDT day : t he ticket - taker at DT Boston Logan airport ; DT customs official who let these fellows in , not CD but JJ times , right up to Bill NNP or George Bush . Solomon : What were their errors ? Hamilton : PRP did n’t pay enough attention to terrorism . PRP did n’t treat PRP with enough urgency . PRP did n’t really anticipate this , even though EX were JJ voices , PRP mentioned Richard Clarke a few times , who were clearly urging them ‘ do PRP ’ – he served both presidents . What PRP decided was two things : DT mandate did not ask PRP to identify NNS or even did not use DT word ‘ accountability ’ . PRP did not VB to VB beyond our mandate . Secondly , what PRP thought was really important in all of this was not so much IN a particular person failed in their responsibility , whatever DT responsibility might be , but IN EX were systemic problems in DT NN WDT PRP really thought need to be identified and corrected . PRP believe IN , had PRP gone into DT question of identifying a hundred NNS here who goofed up on 9/11 , or prior to 9/11 , and did not do their job responsibly , PRP MD have gone outside DT mandate of DT Commission , PRP MD absolutely have destroyed any opportunity for unanimity of view , because DT Commission MD have bogged down with whether Jim Smith or Sally Jones had done their job right , and DT ’s an unending task . Solomon : In retrospect , CD of DT criticisms WDT PRP level in this book “ Without Precedent ” is aimed at both DT FAA and NORAD , both of whom representatives testified before DT Commission , and both of whom gave what to me – and I ’m allowed to be much more impolite than PRP – sounded to me IN lies . PRP told PRP testimony IN simply … DT tapes WDT were subsequently .. WDT have subsequently been revealed , were simply not true . Solomon : And PRP was n’t just lies by ommission , in some senses lies of commission , PRP told PRP things WDT basically did n’t happen . What do PRP make of DT ? Hamilton : Well , I VBP PRP ’re right . PRP gave PRP inaccurate information . PRP asked for a lot of material and a lot of documentation . PRP did not supply PRP all . PRP gave PRP a few things . PRP sent some staff into their headquarters . PRP identified a lot more documents and tapes , PRP eventually gave them to PRP , PRP had to issue a subpoena to VB them . Eventually PRP told PRP PRP had DT story right , PRP had PRP wrong , PRP took a while to VB to DT point , but PRP eventually got here . Did PRP lie to PRP or was PRP inadvertent ? PRP are not a law enforcement agency , PRP did not have DT kind of authority , VBG back to DT mandate again . All of PRP had our suspicions here , but PRP simply did not have DT staff and PRP were right up against DT deadline when this came out , IN PRP did n’t have DT NN to say IN these officials had willfully and intentionally lied . So PRP punted – and PRP VBD , ‘ PRP ca n’t do this , PRP do n’t have DT statutory authority , PRP do n’t have DT staff ’ , PRP do n’t have DT NN ’ . PRP will tell DT story as PRP understood PRP – PRP did mislead PRP . Was PRP wilful ? PRP do n’t VB . PRP ’ll turn PRP over to DT authorities , and DT ’s what PRP did . Hamilton : PRP are now still investigating . Solomon : DT recently released transcripts of what happened at NEADS , which is DT Northeast Air Defence , paints a startling picture of confusion . Hamilton : I VBP DT ’s DT right word : enormous confusion , two of these airplanes WDT crashed were never identified . At CD point , PRP had DT American military jets chasing a phantom jet out in DT Atlantic Ocean – in other words , VBG in DT wrong direction . DT military had very little warning , I VBP , 2 minutes on CD plane and 11 minutes on DT other , if my recollection serves me right , and DT disappointing thing here is IN our , in a sense , first line of defense did n’t work . Solomon : So is DT story – and again , and I talk about those polls , 42 % of Americans – your report very much … and subsequent things WDT have been released , subsequent tapes from places IN NORAD , DT air defence systems , suggest a mass failure of DT first line of defense , which is incompetence and confusion which led to DT lack of prevention of this . Solomon : Now what happens when PRP VBP on to these [ talk radio ] shows , and PRP talk about DT , and PRP VBP every – because PRP understand IN DT landscape is now littered with DT stuff . What do PRP say to all these reports WDT are coming in – constantly ? Hamilton : I VBP NNS do not sufficiently understand how complicated conducting a major investigation is , and how difficult PRP is , in an event of this kind , to chase down every answer to every question , and … Look , I can VB before any audience in America today and I can raise so JJ questions about 9/11 – raise questions , not answer questions , raise questions – about DT investigation . And everbody in DT audience will walk out saying ‘ DT NN misled PRP or lied to PRP . ’ PRP ’s a very easy thing to do ! I can raise questions about our own report ! Solomon : UH what ? What MD PRP raise ? Hamilton : Well , IN I just VBD , about DT CD hijackers , PRP did n’t answer DT question . PRP had to tell DT story as best PRP MD , and PRP did , and PRP made a lot of judgments about DT credibility of evidence . Were PRP right in every case ? I suspect not . Were PRP right in most NNS ? I VBP so . I do not VB at this point of any factual error in our report , IN I MD absolutely say ‘ PRP just plain missed PRP . ’ Now , maybe I need to review PRP more carefully , but I cannot recall right now at this instance any fact IN PRP just plain missed . Solomon : Not IN PRP got wrong , but DT fact WDT was omitted ? Hamilton : Well , I VBP EX were a lot of questions WDT PRP MD not answer , with regard to FAA and NORAD and White House activity , and a lot of other things , PRP just ca n’t answer ’em . Solomon : Is EX anything in retrospect .. I mean , your deadline was so tight , and PRP say WDT forced PRP to make some very tough decisions as to how far ranging DT investigation MD be . In retrospect , if PRP ’d had more NN , what MD PRP have investigated more thoroughly ? Hamilton : I MD have , I VBP PRP spent – if I were critiquing DT work of DT Commission – I VBP PRP spent too much NN on DT question of access . And I MD have liked to have gotten DT over with , say , in DT first half of DT Commission ’s work , so IN PRP MD have spent more NN in putting DT story together , maybe trying to answer some of DT questions PRP raise IN I can’t answer – and polishing DT recommendations . But PRP do n’t … everything does n’t VB IN PRP VBP PRP to VB , and PRP were fighting DT question of access right up to DT end of DT Commission ’s work . Solomon : CD last thing before PRP VBP : PRP had , of course , Vice NNP Dick Cheney and NNP George Bush testify together – not under oath , with no transcript WDT MD be made to DT NN . For a lot of DT family members , and a lot of DT NN , PRP thought ‘ so JJ other NNS testified under oath , so JJ other NNS had JJ testimony – why not DT NNP and DT Vice NNP ? ’ DT again looked as though PRP were trying to obfuscate or hide something – what ’s your view on DT ? Hamilton : I do n’t remember any NN IN a NNP of DT NNP NNPS , on a non-criminal matter , testified under oath . I do recall when NNP Johnson was asked to testify to DT Warren Commission , he just flat out told him , ‘ I am not VBG to do PRP . Presidents of DT NNP NNPS do n’t do DT sort of thing . ’ Hamilton : He wrote a letter . Now , PRP asked NNP Bush and Vice NNP Cheney to testify , PRP VBD no . PRP went back to PRP , PRP VBD , ‘ look , PRP will have no credibility as a commission if PRP do not hear from PRP . ’ PRP considered DT . PRP came back to PRP and VBD , ‘ PRP will talk to PRP – Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton – but not DT other commissioners . ’ PRP VBD DT was not satisfactory , ‘ PRP had to talk to all ten of DT Commission . ’ I VBP into this detail just to tell PRP EX was a long course of negotiation here . Eventually PRP VBD PRP MD both testify – not testify but meet with PRP – all ten commissioners – in DT White House . EX MD be note takers , but no transcript taken . Tom and I asked DT question , ‘ can PRP VB DT information PRP need under this arrangement ? PRP answered DT ‘ yes ’ . In DT actual appearance with DT NNP and DT Vice NNP , PRP were exceedingly co-operative . DT NN sat RB for four hours and responded to questions . At CD point , Tom Kean interrupted CD of DT Commissioners , Richard Ben-Veniste , as I VBP PRP tell in DT book , and VBD , ‘ Richard , PRP have got to respect DT NNP ’s NN . ’ And DT NNP VBD , ‘ look , I ’m in charge here , I ’ll take DT NN , and let Richard ask his questions . ’ PRP felt IN PRP got a very extended long period of NN with DT NN . He was completely candid . He did almost all DT talking . Vice NNP Cheney talked only with reference to what happened at DT White House on 9/11 , because DT NNP was not in DT White House then , and took any question PRP had , and PRP had a lot of questions . Solomon : Do PRP wish EX was a JJ transcript of DT ? Hamilton : If PRP had our preference , MD EX be a JJ transcript ? PRP ’s fine with me . But PRP was a White House call . Solomon : I just VBP to clarify something WDT PRP VBD earlier . PRP VBD IN DT Commission Report did mention NNP Trade Center Building 7 in PRP , what happened . PRP did mention PRP or PRP did n’t ? Hamilton : DT Commission reviewed DT question of DT Building 7 collapse . I do n’t VB specifically if PRP ’s in DT Report , I ca n’t recall IN PRP is , but PRP , uh .. Solomon : I do n’t VB PRP was in DT report . Hamilton : OK , then I ’ll accept your word for DT . Solomon : EX was a decision not to put PRP in DT report ? Hamilton : I do not recall DT was a specific discussion in DT Commission and PRP rejected DT idea of putting Building 7 in , I do n’t recall DT . So I presume IN DT report was written without reference to Building 7 at all , because all of DT attention , of course , was on DT Trade tower buildings . Solomon : And DT black boxes on DT planes : CD bit of evidence I just got asked about , if PRP came up , was : DT last 3 minutes of DT black box on Flight 93 has not been made JJ or is missing , or I do n’t VB what ’s happening . Was EX any discussion as to what happened to those last three minutes ? Hamilton : I do not recall any reference to DT black box . Solomon : Were PRP all found ? Hamilton : I do not VB , off hand , I do not VB . Solomon : Mr. Hamilton , I VBP to thank PRP so much for taking DT NN .. Solomon : .. and for discussing DT book . What ’s DT reaction , by DT way , from DT families to this book ? Hamilton : Well , DT families are a lot of different NNS . And JJ of them have been very enthusiastic . I understand EX is a book coming out which will be quite critical of DT work of DT 9/11 Commission . PRP had all kinds of reactions among DT families : some NNS MD just VB to forget DT whole thing and move on with their lives – NNS react differently to tragedy . Others , as PRP VBP , were enormously supportive of DT Commission . Some began very supportive of DT Commission , and became critical of what PRP did , and and PRP ended up not liking our recommendations – I do n’t VB IN PRP criticized DT report itself so much . But everybody has a … When PRP say ‘ DT families ’ , PRP includes a lot of different attitudes and viewpoints . Solomon : What keeps PRP up at night about 9/11 still ? Hamilton : Not very much , I ’ve turned my attention now to homeland security , and a lot of things bother me RB ."

Yet DT Oracle of Omaha MD n't resist making a few guesses about DT future over DT NNS . PRP 've gathered 12 of his most intriguing predictions and assessed their accuracy in DT slideshow below . "" In terms of cryptocurrencies generally , I can say almost with certainty IN PRP will come to a bad ending , "" Buffett VBD in an interview with CNBC in January 2018 . "" Now , when PRP happens or how or anything else , I do n't VB . "" He added : "" If I MD buy a five - NN put on every CD of DT cryptocurrencies , I 'd be glad to do PRP , but I MD never short a dime 's worth . "" Buffett has been right about cryptocurrencies so far . At DT NN of his prediction , bitcoin traded above $ 14,000 . DT cryptocurrency slumped below $ 4,000 by DT end of 2018 , and it's now trading at about $ 5,200 . "" Ships will sail around DT NN , but DT Flat NNP Society will flourish , "" Buffett VBD in a speech at Columbia 's business school in NNP 1984 . Buffett MD have been making a point about stubborn denialism in financial markets , but his prediction about so - called flat - earthers was correct - PRP 've enjoyed a resurgence in recent NNS . "" PRP is fitting IN DT visit of Halley 's Comet coincided with this percentage gain : neither will be seen again in my lifetime , "" Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 1985 after DT conglomerate grew its net worth by 48.2 % . He RB predicted IN DT 23.2 % compounded annual growth in DT company 's per-share book value DT NN was "" another percentage WDT will not be repeated . "" PRP took nearly 20 NNS for Buffett to prove himself wrong on DT first count . Berkshire Hathaway 's net worth jumped by 48.3 % in 1998 , though DT was largely because DT company issued shares for acquisitions . "" Normally , a gain of 48.3 % MD call for handsprings - but not this NN , "" he told investors . Buffett 's second prediction was way off DT mark . Berkshire Hathaway 's per-share book value rose by 23.3 % in 1986 . PRP has RB grown by at least 23.2 % in more than 10 other NNS since 1985 . Buffett told students at DT University of Kansas in NNP 2005 IN Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert MD struggle to revitalize DT department - store chain . He warned IN rivals such as Walmart and Costco MD undercut Sears , which had just been acquired by Kmart . "" Eddie is a very smart guy , but putting Kmart and Sears together is a tough hand , "" Buffett VBD . "" Turning around a retailer WDT has been slipping for a long NN MD be very difficult . "" Buffett was right on DT money . Sears filed for bankruptcy protection in October . However , some hope remains : Lampert recently won court approval to buy DT 126 - NN - old retailer out of bankruptcy and escape liquidation . "" PRP expect to keep permanently our three primary holdings , Capital Cities / ABC , Inc. , Geico Corporation , and DT Washington Post , "" Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in his 1986 letter . "" Even if these securities were to appear significantly overpriced , PRP MD not anticipate selling them , just as PRP MD not sell See 's or Buffalo Evening NNP if someone were to offer PRP a price far above what PRP believe those businesses are worth , "" he added . Despite his best intentions , Buffett can't resist a great deal . Berkshire Hathaway sold its stake in Capital Cities / ABC to DT Walt Disney Company in 1996 in a cash - and - stock deal worth $ 2.5 billion . He RB flogged his company 's 28 % stake in DT Post to Graham Holdings in a deal worth more than $ 1.1 billion in 2014 , according to DT newspaper . DT Graham family sold DT Post to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a $ 250 million deal in 2013 . Berkshire Hathaway remains a major investor in Geico , See 's Candies , and DT Buffalo NNP . "" In 1988 PRP made major purchases of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Pfd. ( ' Freddie Mac ' ) , "" Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in his letter DT NN . "" PRP expect to hold these securities for a long NN . In fact , when PRP own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements , our favorite holding period is forever . "" Luckily for Buffett , he changed his mind . Berkshire Hathaway sold nearly all its Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae shares in 2000 , slashing its holding to 0.3 % from 8.6 % in 1999 . Buffett told DT Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010 IN he had become "" concerned "" about DT companies ' management . "" PRP were trying to and proclaiming IN PRP MD increase earnings per share in some low double - digit range or something of DT sort , "" he VBD . "" And any NN a large financial institution starts promising regular earnings increases , PRP 're VBG to have trouble , PRP VBP ? "" "" No sensible observer - not even these companies ' most vigorous competitors , assuming PRP are assessing DT matter honestly - questions WDT Coke and Gillette will dominate their fields worldwide for an investment lifetime , "" Buffett wrote in his 1996 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders . "" Indeed , their dominance will probably strengthen . Both companies have significantly expanded their already huge shares of market during DT past ten NNS , and all signs point to their repeating DT performance in DT next decade . "" Buffett 's claims have proved sound so far : Both Coke and Gillette remain DT biggest players in their markets , though DT latter is under mounting pressure .

He ’s RB made more than his share of mistakes throughout his long life , which is why he was DT perfect person to become Rolling Stone ’s newest advice columnist . In his second “ Ask Croz ” column , Crosby takes on anti-vaxxers , open marriages , and finding meaning in your life after devastating loss . I ’ve been married for 15 NNS , and I ’m starting to feel pretty bored . I VBP DT only way this can work in DT long run is if my wife agrees to an open relationship . How do I broach this topic without her VBG insane ? Can open marriages work ? — Evan , Raleigh , North Carolina No . I say DT because I tried PRP . Look , I ’m DT guy WDT wrote “ Triad . ” I tried PRP , believe me . I tried PRP every which way . What happens is PRP ’re imperfect beings and PRP VBP jealous of each other and if PRP ’re VBG with two different girls , CD of them is VBG to VB jealous of DT other NN . PRP happens almost every NN . I VBP NNS WDT have done PRP for a number of NNS and PRP have balanced each other . But generally , when a guy wants an open marriage , he just means he wants to VB laid and he wants permission to scout around and hit on other girls . PRP ca n’t do DT . PRP ’s not VBG to work . I mean , PRP can do PRP , but your love is never VBG to love PRP and trust PRP . PRP ’ll never VB to DT level WDT I ’m at with my wife , where she trusts me . She knows I ’m not VBG to screw around because I have n’t done PRP in 42 NNS and I ’m not VBG to start now . My sister refuses to vaccinate her kids . She ’s worried PRP ’ll cause them to be autistic . I ’m worried PRP are VBG to VB measles or worse . MD I be wrong to take them to a doctor without her knowing ? I VBP a doctor who ’ll do PRP . — Summer , Portland , Oregon This is serious business . DT anti-vaxxers are wrong . PRP are absolutely wrong . Their information is incorrect and vaccinating NNS does not cause NN . Period . NN is an entirely different thing . Read Steve Silberman ’s book [ NeuroTribes : DT Legacy of NNP and DT Future of Neurodiversity ] and PRP will understand NN a lot better . NNS who are selling DT anti-vaxxer nonsense are DT same NNS who VBP DT NN is flat . PRP are just ignorant and wrong . And DT problem comes in when PRP ’re in inflicting this on someone else . PRP ’re saying your kid ca n’t have DT medicine , but PRP are pushing your ignorance and stupidity on your kid and DT can hurt them very , very badly . But DT ’s not DT worst part . DT worst part is PRP can cause a whole bunch of other NNS to VB sick . DT is an irresponsibility I can hardly countenance at all . I can’t . EX is n’t any way I can find any forgiveness in my heart for NNS WDT do DT . PRP is utterly stupid . All of DT evidence contradicts PRP and PRP ’re doing great harm . NNS trying to tell PRP PRP ’s not are selling PRP a load of crap . I am 60 , widowed and childless . I am looking for ways to put life in my life . How do I lose DT old - and - in - DT - way feeling ? — Elizabeth , Rock Hill , South Carolina PRP need to do PRP honestly . Look at yourself and see where EX is something WDT matters enough to PRP to VB off your butt and VB out RB and do PRP . Maybe its DT Women ’s March or helping out at DT local old NNS ’s shelter or maybe helping NNS who are homeless . Look for something WDT gives calm and purpose to your life and fills up your day with a bunch of really great stuff . DT way I judge NNS , CD of DT first things I ask myself when meeting someone and making a judgment is , “ Who have PRP helped ? ” DT ’s a way to give purpose to your life WDT is really , really good . Half DT NNS on DT NN need help in CD way or another : Food , shelter , clothing , a loving hand , somebody who gives a shit . PRP need DT . If PRP can do DT , PRP ’re doing a good deed . PRP ’re helping . PRP ’re lifting . Please keep DT questions for Croz coming . PRP can e-mail them to askcroz@rollingstone or simply tweet them with DT hashtag # AskCroz . Please make sure PRP are asking for legit life advice . PRP ’ve gotten JJ questions about his music career and PRP ’re all very interesting , but not what PRP ’re looking for here ."

"" What PRP Are n’t Being Told About DT NN PRP Live In How DT “ NN Theory ” Label Was Conceived To Derail DT Truth Movement How Covert American Agents Infiltrate DT Internet to Manipulate , Deceive , and Destroy Reputations Feared Collapse Of And In 2016 Cause Russian Dread By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers A highly disturbing Security Council ( SCRF ) report circulating in DT Kremlin today is warning IN DT coming NN , 2016 , MD very well see DT collapse of DT governments of DT NNP NNPS and Saudi Arabia as DT citizens in both of these nations have begun revolting against DT massive corruption these regimes rule by — and which should PRP both collapse MD launch upon DT entire NN an “ era of unprecedented instability ” . DT Security Council , this report explains , is NNP Putin ’s consultative body WDT works out his decisions on national security affairs and threats to DT Federation and is composed of key ministers and agency heads and chaired by NNP Putin himself . Though not meant to be completely “ free of error ” , this report VBZ , DT Security Council is , nevertheless , obligated to provide to NNP Putin their analysis of JJ affairs as PRP MD effect DT national security interests of DT Federation , and which DT collapse of these two nations , NNP NNPS and Saudi Arabia , poses CD of DT greatest existential threats to Russia PRP has ever seen . Of DT JJ facts involved in fearing DT collapse of DT NNP NNPS NN , this report says , are DT JJ warnings being issued in America today IN “ internal war is on DT horizon ” and some experts even questioning if civil war has n’t , in fact , already begun . Leading to these fears of internal war erupting in DT , this report continues , is DT complete polarization of DT American NNS against each other driven by what a recent NN stated was due to this nation having become an oligarchy after its abandoning of democracy . With an oligarchy being a power structure in which power effectively rests with a small number of NNS , this report explains , DT grave situation presently existing in DT NNP NNPS is being “ ignored to their peril ” by these elites — most especially current Presidential hopeful Hillary NNP , who as DT wife of a former NNP , Bill NNP , was a former NNP Senator and NNP Secretary of NNP , and was DT driving force in DT “ greatest gift to bankers ” ever seen in DT NNP NNPS when she personally pushed through DT NNP Congress a law forbidding , for DT first NN in American history , collage students to declare bankruptcy on their student loans , which has plunged millions of them into a life of debt servitude unable to contribute their earnings to their nations economy as all of their money now goes to bankers . Following in Hillary NNP ’s footsteps in a “ wholesale plundering to wealth ” scheme to enrich bankers at DT expense of DT American NNS , this report continues , is NNP Obama — who in his first four NNS in office increased his worth 800 % from $ 1.3 million to $ 11.8 million and once he leaves office is estimated will be able to rake in a staggering $ 100 million more . With an economy of a nation being more important than even its military strength , this report warns , NNP Obama and DT oligarchs associated with him , including DT NNP and Bush dynasties , have further destroyed America ’s ability to make jobs — and which a recent Gallup article described grimly as : “ Simply put , startups and shootups ( small businesses WDT grow larger ) have been in a death spiral . ” Even though Obama and NNP regime supporter George Soros is warning these oligarchs of DT grave crisis PRP ’re creating , this report notes , nothing appears to be stopping these oligarchs from DT pillaging of DT American NNS — and has become so dangerous IN a JJ Gallup poll showed IN a staggering 75 % of DT American NN believe corruption is “ widespread ” in their NN , not incompetence , but corruption , and IN this alarming figure has held steady since 2010 , and which history has always shown no NN can survive under DT weight of . As concerning to DT Federation of what DT collapse of DT NNP NNPS MD do to DT NN , this report continues , even more so are DT concerns relating to DT collapse of Saudi Arabia . With even former NNP Ronald Reagan top official David Stockman warning this past week IN DT House of Saud is “ a scourge on mankind WDT should have been eliminated decades ago ” and must be “ swept into DT dustbin of history ” , SC experts in this report say , DT collapse of this brutal oil rich monarchy MD be coming sooner than later as its economy nears total collapse and its Shiite Muslim minority is now threatening to secede and “ take all of its oil to Iran ” . DT total collapse of Saudi Arabia is inevitable , this report VBZ JJ experts are warning , as this country is ugly , depressing and unappealing IN a desert slaughterhouse whose NNS are corrupt , indulgent , inbred , unintelligent , lazy , fat , cruel , inept and completely flaky and unreliable and have no skills nor work ethics . And with DT House of Saud belonging to DT most aberrant sect of Sunni Muslims known as Wahhabism , this report further warns , PRP is now becoming apparent even to DT West IN DT much more tolerant , and women rights supporting , Shiite Muslim peoples led by Iran are more in tune to what DT NN really is than DT “ barbarian ” Sunni nations led by Saudi Arabia and their Gulf NN sycophants Bahrain , Kuwait and NNP Arab Emirates — who , unlike Shiite led Iran ( along with Shiite - led Syria and Lebanon ) , have never allowed their citizens to vote against their despotic monarchial rule . But to DT greatest fears of Saudi Arabia and PRP$ Gulf NN allies , along with their Western backers , this report explains , is IN even those these nations are “ ruled for life ” by Sunni Muslim monarchs , their oppressed Shiite citizens live on top of nearly all of DT oil in DT entire Middle East — and all of whom have pledged their allegiance to Iran . And instead of coming to grips with its collapse , this report warns , DT Saudi NN has decided IN rather than learning lessons from DT hubris of its neighbours , PRP wo n’t wait for war to come home — but has readily begun exporting war in DT region in its madcap bid to extend its geopolitical hegemony and prolong its petro-dominance . Even worse , this report continues , in Saudi Arabia ’s “ insane bid ” to push Iran into open conflict in DT hopes IN DT Obama regime will bail them out through massive war , PRP not only torpedoed America ’s entire Middle Eastern policy with their beheading of their most prominent , and peaceful , Shiite clerics , today PRP even dared to bomb DT Iranian embassy in Yemen . Though DT Security Council has not assigned a “ percentage likelihood ” of either DT NNP NNPS or Saudi Arabian governments actually collapsing this NN , this report concludes , PRP have advised NNP Putin IN he should immediately begin preparing for PRP being so anyway — just in case .

These fossils got their start when a dinosaur died in an environment WDT had lots of moving sediment , IN an ocean , riverbed or lake . CD such place is DT benthic zone -- DT deepest part of a body of NN . This sediment quickly buried DT dinosaur , offering its body some protection PRP from decomposition . While DT dinosaur 's soft parts still eventually decomposed , its hard parts -- bones , teeth and claws -- remained . But a buried bone is n't DT same thing as a fossil -- to become a fossil , DT bone has to become rock . DT organic parts of DT bone , IN blood cells , collagen ( a protein ) , and fat , eventually break down . But DT inorganic parts of DT bone , or DT parts made from minerals IN calcium , have more staying power . PRP remain after DT organic materials have disappeared , creating a fragile , porous mineral in DT shape of DT original bone . Other minerals reinforce this bone , burning into a fossil . NN gradually makes its way into DT bone , carrying minerals IN iron and calcium carbonate picked up from DT surrounding sediment . As DT NN penetrates DT dinosaur 's bones , some of these minerals precipitate into their microscopic pores . As this process continues , DT bone becomes more and more rocklike . PRP 's IN filling a sponge with glue -- DT sponge 's physical structure stays DT same , and DT pores and pockets within PRP fill up . DT glue makes DT sponge sturdier and more resistant to damage . Large , thick bones , which have more room for mineral glue , make better fossils than small , flat bones . Over DT course of millions of NNS , DT sediment around these reinforced bones becomes sedimentary rock . Erosion , tides and other natural processes continue to deposit more sediment , and this sediment becomes rock , too . As long as PRP can withstand DT pressure from DT surrounding rock , DT bones remain safely hidden and preserved . After millions of NNS , some natural process , IN DT gradual shifting of DT NN 's surface , can reveal these layers of rock and DT fossils PRP contain . Sedimentary rock can RB hold trace fossils , which record an organism 's behavior . Some of DT most well - known trace fossils are trackways , or DT tracks of extinct animals . These form when an animal leaves its prints in soft but sturdy soil , which creates a mold . This mold fills with sediment , and both DT mold and its filling harden over millions of NNS . Forces IN erosion remove DT upper layers of rock , revealing DT preserved footprints underneath . Sediment can RB fill DT mold and harden into a cast , or a reproduction of DT foot WDT made DT print . This can happen with other traces , too , IN burrows and tunnels . Some other trace fossils include coprolites ( fossilized dung ) tooth marks on bones or wood , and nests . Sediment can even preserve plant life . Plants can make impressions in hardening sediment or become petrified wood after VBG through much DT same process as fossilized dinosaur bones do . This type of fossilization creates sturdy fossils , but PRP can only take place in specific conditions . Next , PRP 'll look at DT other ways life forms can be buried , encased or otherwise protected so their remains last millions of NNS ."

CAMBRIDGE , Mass . — For a veteran epidemiologist , an authority on homeland security , and a JJ NN reporter , DT outbreak of DT novel NN is DT type of emergency PRP had long anticipated . But now IN PRP is here , DT three experts VBD Friday , PRP still MD n’t help but feel DT monumentality of what PRP were watching unfold . “ PRP ’s DT most daunting NN WDT PRP ’ve contended with in half a century or more , ” Michael Mina , an epidemiologist at Harvard ’s T.H. Chan School of NNP NNP , VBD at a panel discussion Friday at Harvard ’s Kennedy School of NNP . Helen Branswell , STAT ’s infectious diseases and JJ NN reporter , has covered emerging pathogens since DT 2003 SARS outbreak . But with DT JJ NN , Branswell VBD during DT panel , “ PRP ’s bizarre but I find myself startled . Having written about DT possibility of something IN this for NNS , I still find myself really startled IN PRP ’s happening , and I do n’t VB why DT is . ” She compared DT circumstances now to DT summer of 2014 , when Ebola was racing through West Africa and DT NN did n’t seem to have a plan to stop PRP . “ Except IN I never worried then about Ebola spreading in DT city I lived in , ” she VBD . “ PRP ’s different now . ” As DT panel was occurring , DT Cambridge - based drug company Biogen VBD IN top executives had been at a meeting at a Boston hotel last week WDT was RB attended by eight NNS who later tested positive for DT NN , which causes a NN WDT authorities have named NNP - CD . DT company asked JJ employees to work from home for DT next two weeks . In introducing DT Harvard panel , Mark Gearan , director of DT Kennedy School ’s Institute of Politics , which hosted DT event , directed students and others at Harvard to JJ travel policies DT university issued on Friday , just before DT panel started . PRP included a ban on university - related international travel and “ non-essential ” university - related domestic air travel , and discourage personal international travel . “ PRP strongly discourage any non-essential meetings or events of 100 NNS or more , ” DT email to DT campus read . ( Institute of Politics staff members RB put more than DT usual space between chairs in DT audience . ) Panel moderator Rick Berke , STAT ’s executive editor , asked DT crowd of roughly 100 NNS if any of them had considered not coming to DT event . A few raised their hands . “ Do I VB IN this is a bad idea ? ” Mina VBD when asked if DT panel should be held . “ I VBP PRP ’re hitting DT NN in DT course of this epidemic where PRP might consider IN this should be CD of DT last types of events IN this . ” Here are some highlights from DT event . Why this NN is different DT spread of DT JJ NN has been compared to influenza , which RB causes a respiratory illness . But , as DT panelists pointed out , EX are no drugs or NNS yet for treating or preventing DT NN , known as SARS - CoV - 2 , as EX are for NN . In addition , PRP are exposed to different NN strains throughout our lives , which help PRP build immunity . No NN had immunity to this JJ NN . “ PRP have an entirely susceptible population , ” Mina VBD . “ DT potential for this to burn through a population very quickly is very high without extraordinary measures . ” As researchers race to VB DT NN , PRP are finding IN PRP does not seem to be infecting great numbers of NNS , or at least making them very sick . ( Experts around DT globe are still trying to figure out just how broadly DT infection has spread , given IN JJ mild NNS are likely to be missed . ) But PRP is causing serious harm to older NNS and those with underlying diseases or weakened immune systems . “ This NN , on DT CD hand , EX ’s a saving grace WDT PRP does n’t seem to be impacting our young , and DT is amazing , ” Mina VBD . “ But DT mortality rate among NNS who are getting infected above 80 NNS old is 15 - plus % . ” How to mentally prepare for this pandemic If PRP plan for DT disruptions WDT DT response to DT pandemic MD require , PRP will seem less unexpected when schools are canceled or PRP ’re told to work from home , advised panelist Juliette Kayyem , DT faculty chair of DT Kennedy School ’s homeland security program and a former homeland security official at DT NN and federal level . “ VB your head around this is practical , ” she VBD . “ PRP ’s here , EX are VBG to be massive disruptions to our social fabric in terms of your day to day . All of PRP have a part in stopping DT spread of this … but PRP have to treat this as part of DT plan . PRP ’re at DT stage now . ” Unlike with a natural disaster or terrorist attack , “ PRP do n’t have a boom moment , ” she VBD , and DT NN was more slow rolling . “ When do PRP activate ? ” she VBD . “ DT ’s sort of DT challenge right now . ” Kayyem , who worked in DT Obama administration , RB made DT point IN DT response will be a patchwork . Some schools will close , others will remain open . DT federal NN ’s bungled rollout of testing for SARS - CoV - 2 , which has limited how JJ NNS can VB tested for DT NN but is now being remedied , did not inspire much confidence in DT U.S. response initially . But Kayyem VBD IN as NNS are detected in more places , PRP will largely be on local and NN agencies . She described DT action as “ locally executed , NN managed , and federally supported . ” As for how to judge whether DT response is working : “ DT bad thing has happened , PRP ’s coming , PRP ’s here , ” she VBD . “ PRP ’re in DT response phase . Our measure of success is not containment anymore . Our measure of success now is , will fewer NNS die or VB severely sick because of our efforts ? ” PRP ’s not just DT NN WDT has a role to play , she VBD . Universities , DT NN , and employers need to act responsibly . Individuals RB have to VB involved , whether PRP ’s staying home if PRP are not feeling well or making sure PRP have had DT NN shot . After all , if PRP can avoid getting DT NN , DT frees up space for NN care providers to deal with NNP - CD NNS . Mina VBD DT fragmented U.S. NN care system leaves him worried about DT cohesion of a response . “ I do n’t VB to sound defeatist here , but DT NN of our NN care system , DT way PRP have privatized everything about PRP for DT most part , is VBG to seriously impact our ability , ” he VBD , adding IN , “ PRP have no ability to create out of DT blue JJ hospital beds . PRP ca n’t even test appropriately . ” “ If PRP ca n’t figure how to run some PCR instruments because PRP can’t work together as a society — this is within networks , within hospitals , within DT national NN , everything — I really am very concerned about this in a way WDT far exceeds our concerns for other viruses and other pathogens , and DT most vulnerable are DT elderly . ” DT response in NNP , where DT NN first emerged and NNS quickly exploded , included DT unprecedented steps of essentially quarantining tens of millions of NNS in and around Wuhan , DT city at DT center of DT outbreak . EX were concerns about NNS with other diseases being able to VB DT care PRP needed and DT trampling of individual liberty . But from a raw epidemiological perspective , JJ NN authorities have argued IN such drastic measures gave DT NN more NN to prepare . DT interventions in NNP , PRP say , delayed DT wave of NNS in other places around DT NN . “ I VBP PRP was absolutely DT right thing , ” Mina VBD . “ PRP truly bought DT rest of DT NN at least a month . DT U.S. wasted PRP , in my opinion , but JJ NNS did not . ” Kayyem agreed about DT initial U.S. response . “ When DT story is written about U.S. preparedness for this , Chapter 1 will be called ‘ Squandered NNP . ’ Not just on DT JJ side , but on DT preparedness side , ” she VBD . “ What were PRP doing ? And now , how do PRP make up for lost NN ? PRP ’s not just DT kits . PRP ’s why this week PRP seemed so flat - footed and surprised by things IN school closings . School closings were inevitable DT second PRP had DT first patients . ” Where this MD VB from here Branswell noted IN some NNS , based on both biology and socioeconomics , will be able to weather DT outbreak more safely and less disruptively than others . “ I ’m very worried right now about vulnerable populations , ” she VBD . “ I ’m really concerned about NNS living in long - term care facilities . If this NN gets into long - term care facilities [ as PRP has in DT Seattle area ] , PRP will be really bad . I ’m worried about NNS who stay in homeless shelters . I ’m worried about NNS who work in retail . I ’m worried about NNS who do n’t have DT money to stockpile food because PRP do n’t have extra money . I ’m worried about DT fact IN EX is n’t much social cohesion right now . NNS seem to be really angry at each other a lot and this is a NN when PRP ’re really VBG to need to help each other . ” Kayyem VBD IN organizers of large events , including DT presidential nominating conventions and DT Olympics , need to start coming up with Plan Bs . DT decisions about whether to actually VB with these alternate plans ca n’t be made yet , but PRP is crucial to start developing contingencies . “ I can not tell PRP when PRP ’re VBG to activate and when PRP ’s VBG to impact , but if DT parties are not thinking about how PRP pick your nominee in a different manner , shame on them , ” she VBD about DT conventions . “ PRP do n’t VB where PRP will be at DT moment , ” she added . “ I VBP PRP need to be comfortable making decisions in week allotments . ” After DT event , Harvard officials VBD PRP were considering cancelling a full roster of Kennedy School Forums for next week , making Friday ’s potentially their last JJ event at DT Kennedy School for quite a while .

I apologize . ” Irving VBD he ’s since learned certain thoughts are best kept in “ intimate conversations . ” This whole saga started in February 2017 , when Irving questioned whether DT NNP is flat on a podcast WDT came out shortly before All - Star weekend DT NN in NNP Orleans . PRP became a major story and even NBA Commissioner Adam Silver — who , IN Irving , went to Duke — was asked to offer his opinion . “ Kyrie and I went to DT same college , ” Silver VBD then . “ He MD have taken some different courses . ” Irving indicated in DT days and months WDT followed DT podcast IN he initially made DT remarks to promote conversation and prove a point how stories in this social - NN age can spread rapidly .

In June 1936 Max Hahn and his wife Emma were on a walk beside a waterfall near to London , Texas , when PRP noticed a rock with wood protruding from its core . PRP decided to take DT oddity home and later cracked PRP open with a hammer and a chisel . What PRP found within shocked DT archaeological and scientific community . Embedded in DT rock was what appeared to be some type of ancient man made hammer . A team of archaeologists analysed and dated PRP . DT rock encasing DT hammer was dated to more than 400 million NNS old . DT hammer itself turned out to be more than 500 million NNS old . Additionally , a section of DT wooden handle had begun DT metamorphosis into coal . DT hammer ’s head , made of more than 96 % iron , is far more pure than anything nature MD have achieved without assistance from relatively modern smelting methods . In 1889 near Nampa , Idaho , whilst workers were boring an artesian well , a small figurine made of baked clay was extracted from a depth of 320 feet . To reach this depth DT workers had to cut through fifteen feet of basalt lava and JJ other strata below DT . DT in itself does not seem remarkable , until PRP considers IN DT very top layer of lava has been dated to at least 15 million NNS old ! PRP is currently accepted by NN and geology WDT coal is a by - product of decaying vegetation . DT vegetation becomes buried over NN and is covered with sediment . DT sediment eventually fossilises and becomes rock . This natural process of coal formation takes up to 400 million NNS to accomplish . Anything WDT is found in lumps of coal or in coal seams during mining , had to have been placed or dropped into DT vegetation before PRP was buried in sediment . In 1944 , as a ten NN old boy , Newton Anderson , dropped a lump of coal in his basement and PRP broke in half as PRP hit DT floor . What he discovered inside defies explanation based upon current scientific orthodoxy . Inside DT coal was a hand crafted brass alloy bell with an iron clapper and sculptured handle . When an analysis was carried out PRP was discovered IN DT bell was made from anunusual mix of metals , different from any known modern alloy production ( including copper , zinc , tin , arsenic , iodine , and selenium ) . DT seam from whence this lump of coal was mined is estimated to be 300,000,000 NNS old ! A hand crafted bell found in a 300 million NN old lump of coal ! These extraordinary discoveries although bizarre , are not unique or even uncommon . EX are literally thousands of them collecting dust , locked away from JJ scrutiny in DT vaults of museums throughout DT NN . EX are JJ other unusual reported finds including DT following : DT Morrisonville , Illinois Times , on June 11 , 1891 , reported how Mrs. S. W. Culp found a circular shaped eight - carat gold chain , about 10 inches long , embedded in a lump of coal after she broke PRP apart to put in her scuttle . DT chain was described as “ antique ” and of “ quaint workmanship . ” Displayed in a museum at Glen Rose , Texas , is a cast iron pot reportedly found in a large lump of coal in 1912 by a worker feeding coal into DT furnace of a power plant . When he split open DT coal DT worker VBD DT pot fell out , leaving its impression in DT coal . Yet another report found in DT Epoch Times told of a Colorado rancher who in DT 1800 ’s broke open a lump of coal , dug from a vein some 300 feet below DT surface , and discovered a “ strange - looking iron thimble . ” DT Salzburg Cube is yet another ancient puzzle found by a worker named Reidl , in an Austrian foundry in 1885 . IN DT others , this man broke open a block of coal and found a metal cube embedded inside . Recent analysis established DT object was of forged iron and obviously hand crafted . DT coal PRP was found in was millions of NNS old . DT list of such items goes on and on and on . Welcome to DT NN of Ooparts , or Out of Place Artefacts . Out of place artefacts ( Ooparts ) are so named because conventional scientific wisdom ( an oxymoron if ever EX was CD ) VBZ IN these artefacts should n’t exist based upon currently accepted beliefs regarding our origins and history . These discoveries are “ out of place ” in DT orthodox timeline of human history . DT usual methods of DT conformist scientific community , when faced with such anomalies is to attempt to debunk their reported age , or perhaps endeavour to discredit DT source of DT report or even DT reporter . If this approach fails then usually DT artefacts themselves are banished to DT shadowy vaults of museums and warehouses , never to be seen again . If these unusual artefacts were “ CD offs ” then perhaps PRP MD be forgiven for accepting DT view espoused by DT mainstream scientific and archaeological community IN PRP are hoaxes or misreported stories . However , when PRP realises IN thousands upon thousands of these anomalous artefacts have been discovered and reported over DT NNS , then PRP MD need to re-evaluate ones acceptance of DT integrity of mainstream archaeology and NN . Occasionally an honest archaeologist will attempt to reveal to DT NN DT true age and origin of such anomalous objects . PRP will question DT accepted beliefs of their mainstream peers . PRP usually find IN their career ends quite abruptly . Unfortunately , DT majority just accept what PRP are taught in school and university without question . DT is how our educational system is designed . PRP does not encourage individuality and originality . PRP purely indoctrinates CD with established beliefs and dogma . If PRP requires evidence of this “ mainstream ” mentality , CD need look no further than DT realms of psychiatry . Modern psychiatry seeks to demonize and declare mentally ill anyone who deviates from what is regarded as DT norm . These so called “ mental NN professionals ” have even invented a JJ mental disorder named Oppositional Defiant Disorder , or ODD ( love DT irony of DT abbreviation ) . This newly invented condition is listed in DT latest instalment of DT industry ’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , or DSM , which dubs NNS who do not conform to what those in charge declare to be normal , as mentally insane . So RB PRP have your proof – I ’m obviously an unmitigated nutter and completely insane . At least DT is what those in authority MD VB everyone to believe ! On CD side of DT field PRP have DT Darwinists and their theory of evolution , trying to establish DT extremely flawed view WDT PRP have somehow evolved into highly intelligent sentient beings from a primordial blob of gunge , miraculously brought to life by an electrical storm billions of NNS ago . ( Perhaps CD of this cults followers MD explain to me when “ consciousness ” evolved , and provide proof – I await with baited breath ! ) On DT other side PRP have DT creationists with DT belief IN some omnipotent invisible being who lives in DT clouds , waved his magic wand about 7,000 NNS ago and created DT NN and everything on PRP . Again DT adherents of this equally flawed theory rely on nothing more than a book called DT Bible for their “ proof ” of this concept . DT fact IN this book has been bastardised during translation numerous times during its existence , has been re-written to certain individuals personal preference on a number of occasions , and has had JJ complete chapters omitted , is irrelevant to its followers . All PRP require is “ faith ” . Proof and evidence is not a prerequisite ! PRP MD n’t VB more opposing beliefs if CD tried , and both camps adhere to their beliefs voraciously , and with unshakable fervour . Yet neither are based on any kind of factual or hard evidence . DT reality is IN DT origin of DT human race is a total enigma . No NN , anywhere , actually knows how old humanity is or how and where PRP originated . PRP is a complete mystery . Yet from birth CD is indoctrinated into CD or DT other of DT above factions , with no questions asked or alternative opinions allowed . DT problem DT mainstream has with these anomalous Ooparts is IN PRP throw into question every single established belief EX is regarding our past . PRP seems IN everywhere PRP look , PRP find things WDT contradict much of DT scientific orthodoxy of today . DT scientific establishment will never acknowledge or admit IN these artefacts are authentic . To do so MD be to admit IN PRP are completely wrong about our origins , and consequently , invalidate all of DT text books used to indoctrinate PRP and our NNS . DT discovery of Ooparts completely annihilates DT [ comparatively recent ] theory of evolution . If , as this hypothesis MD have PRP believe , modern humans only evolved 200,000 NNS ago ( or thereabouts ) , PRP has to ask how man made artefacts , found in substrata originating millions of NNS ago , MD be explained ? Alternatively , DT advocates of creationism have a very quaint way of “ acknowledging ” DT existence of Ooparts , and bizarrely , actually believe IN Ooparts substantiate their NN view . Creationists just completely disregard DT established dating methods , and declare every single recognized archaeological and geological process null and void . PRP MD have PRP all believe IN coal seams , rock strata , fossils , minerals , precious stones and every other antediluvian element , took only a few thousand NNS to form . Yet DT psychiatric establishment MD have me labelled as DT loony for questioning this baloney . VB figure ! EX will no doubt be readers who , similar to predictable conservative archaeologists , and probably due to their indoctrinated belief system , will RB dismiss DT aforementioned Ooparts as hoaxes or forgeries . Perhaps PRP MD VB to consider and offer an explanation for DT following . PRP is an accepted belief IN humans and dinosaurs did not co-exist . According to conventional academia , dinosaurs roamed DT NN between 65 and 225 million NNS ago , whereas DT earliest upright biped humanoid , homo erectus , only appeared about 1.8 million NNS ago . However , in 1968 a palaeontologist named Stan Taylor began excavations of fossilised dinosaur footprints , discovered in DT bed of DT Paluxy river near Glen Rose , Texas . What he unearthed shocked and dumbfounded DT scientific community . Alongside DT dinosaur tracks , in exactly DT same cretaceous fossilised strata , were well preserved human footprints . DT immediate reaction of evolutionists , archaeologists , and NN in general , was to debunk DT find as a hoax . “ PRP were carved into DT rock by hoaxers ” or “ PRP are not human footprints , but more dinosaur footprints WDT have been eroded to look human ” were DT arguments most commonly proposed . However , their line of reasoning falls somewhat flat when PRP asks why only DT human prints were eroded and not RB DT 3 toed dinosaur prints ? Additionally PRP has to consider , if DT human prints were carved as a hoax , how did DT hoaxers manage to carve further human footprints WDT continued under bedrock WDT was later removed from DT side of DT river bed ? Since DT initial discovery , hundreds more human footprints have been discovered and unearthed , both in Paluxy and in JJ other places around DT globe . Either those hoaxers have unlimited NN and budget – or someone is telling porkies ! Next NN needs to consider another find discovered in 100 million NN old cretaceous limestone . A fossilised human finger , which was found along with a childs tooth and human hair . This finger has been subjected to numerous scientific tests and analysis . Sectioning revealed DT typical porous bone structure expected in a human finger . Additionally a Cat-scan and MRI scan identified joints and traced tendons throughout DT length of DT fossil . This is CD find IN NN cannot explain away as a hoax . at - scan of a human fossilised finger shows dark areas showing DT interior of bones and bone marrow , along with tendons . EX is however another find of recent NNS WDT blows all of DT others into a cocked hat regarding age . Over DT past few decades , miners near DT little town of Ottosdal in Western Transvaal , South Africa , have been digging up hundreds of mysterious metal spheres . These spheres measure between 25 and 100 mm in diameter , and some are etched with three parallel grooves running completely around DT equator . Two types of spheres have been found . CD is composed of a solid bluish metal with flecks of white , DT other is hollowed out and filled with a spongy white substance . These spheres are reportedly so delicately balanced IN even with modern technology , PRP MD need to be made in a zero gravity environment to attain these characteristics . These objects have become known as DT Klerksdorp spheres . Geologists have attempted to debunk these artefacts as natural formations or “ limonite concretions ” . PRP fail to explain sufficiently how these formations occurred naturally with perfectly straight and perfectly spaced grooves around DT centres . Perhaps DT real reason for such fervent attempted debunking by DT scientific community , is IN DT rock in which these spheres where found is Precambrian – and dated to 2.8 billion NNS old ! Whether PRP wishes to accept these out of place artefacts as genuine or not is I suppose , down to personal beliefs . Evolutionists refuse to accept them as to do so MD mean re-evaluating their whole indoctrinated belief system . PRP will even stoop to producing outright fantasy in their attempts to discredit these discoveries . If DT fails then PRP will just pretend IN PRP do not exist , and then hide them away – forever . Creationists on DT other hand willingly accept them as some bizarre kind of proof IN DT universe is only about 7,000 NNS old , and totally ignore any evidence , from any source , to DT contrary . PRP continue to cling to a medieval belief system based purely on blind faith . How quaint . Personally , I do n’t belong to either camp . I keep an open mind regarding our origins . I do n’t have any particular “ philosophy ” on DT subject but rather prefer to adapt my understanding as JJ evidence becomes available . My only current belief based upon all of DT available facts to date is IN DT human race has inhabited this NN for millions of NNS longer than is presently accepted . I realise IN I will never discover DT answer to DT question of our origin . DT human race has been searching for this answer since DT dawn of NN , and PRP still evades PRP . Everything PRP have been taught in our schools and universities about our origin and history , is based upon nothing more than speculation and hypothesis . EX is not a single provable fact out RB WDT conclusively answers DT question “ where do PRP come from ” What I will continue to do however is question everything , and not just blindly accept any mainstream viewpoint because PRP happens to be fashionable at DT NN . If DT means CD day I VBP a knock at my door from men in white coats holding a straight jacket , then so be PRP ……"

As funny and unbelievable as this is , he 's not DT only NBA star WDT has made recent comments about DT NNP being flat , which appears to be a growing sentiment in DT NBA . During DT podcast , Shaquille O’Neal claimed DT NNP is flat because he 's driven JJ times from coast to coast and PRP seems flat to him while driving . DT full extent of his nonsensical reasoning is below , which was promoted in response to Kyrie Irving insisting he believes DT NNP is flat . “ PRP ’s true . DT NNP is flat . DT NNP is flat . Yes , PRP is . Listen , EX are three ways to manipulate DT mind — what PRP read , what PRP see and what PRP hear . In school , first thing PRP teach PRP is , ‘ Oh , Columbus discovered America , ’ but when he got RB , EX were some fair - skinned NNS with DT long hair smoking on DT peace pipes . So , what does DT tell PRP ? Columbus did n’t discover America . So , listen , I drive from coast to coast , and this s*** is flat to me . I ’m just saying . I drive from Florida to California all DT NN , and PRP ’s flat to me . I do not VB up and down at a 360 - degree angle , and all DT stuff about gravity , have PRP looked outside Atlanta lately and seen all these buildings ? PRP mean to tell me IN NNP is under PRP ? NNP is under PRP ? PRP ’s not . DT NN is flat . ” Hopefully Shaq is joking and does n't honestly believe DT NNP is flat . However , when CD of his co-hosts injected some reason IN PRP have satellite imagery from space WDT shows DT NNP is round Shaq responded with "" Oh satellite imagery ? DT MD be [ a ] drone or made up . "" He followed PRP up insisting IN it's flat “ I ’m just saying IN when I drive from Florida to NNP York – flat . NNP York to Seattle – flat . Seattle to LA – flat . ” These comments are on DT back of several high - profile NBA players insisting DT NNP is flat from their views . Kyrie Irving , a Cleveland Cavaliers ' player , stated IN he believes DT NNP is flat , adding IN “ I ’ve seen a lot of things WDT my educational system has VBN DT was real WDT turned out to be completely fake . "" DT flat NNP claim by Kyrie was further backed by Draymond Green of DT Golden NNP Warriors and Wilson Chandler of DT Denver Nuggets who claimed NASA 's photos of NNP from space MD have been easily be altered using a smartphone . PRP is entirely possible IN some or all of DT aforementioned NBA stars do not actually believe DT NNP is flat and are simply joking . Ultimately , PRP does n't entirely matter whether PRP are serious or joking because DT perception and reaction has been DT same . DT harm is when role models openly oppose basic fundamentals of NN without any data backing PRP . Hopefully those WDT look up to these players realize IN a belief in NN underpins every piece of their daily life from transportation to JJ advances and smartphones . Shaq has built up quite a resume , 15 NN NBA All - star , 7th place in all - NN points scored , 3 NN NBA All Star Game MVP , and has even earned a doctorate .

As PRP drew near , five or six strong , tramping heavily through DT turnips , I was struck by DT apparent tremor of DT NN beneath me . PRP was shivering IN a jelly — or I was ; for a moment I was in doubt which . Spreading out my hands upon DT surface and lying as dose and flat as I MD , l was soon made sure IN DT tremor was really in DT NN and not in me . PRP grew more and more distinct , keeping NN with DT tramp of DT walkers . When at last PRP reached me I told them of their Neptunian feat , and , them jump altogether a few yards off , was gratified to find IN I MD thus bring about a. very respectable earthquake at will . DT motion was very peculiar , and I can well believe IN a queasier stomach than mine MD soon be conscious of something very IN a ^l de terre . PRP examined DT structure of this skipping hill , hut found nothing WDT helped PRP much to an explanation . PRP was mainly made up of a thick cap of gravel on a base of red sandstone , and so was not likely to contain anything IN a high - arched hollow or concealed morass within . This vivid little experience made me readier , perhaps , than some to accept DT striking statements about NN shaking made by DT brothers Darwin at DT York meeting of DT British Association . Especially was I prepared to give credit to what PRP quoted from DT Astronomer Royal about Greenwich Hill and DT Observatory . He wrote : ” In DT old times of Greenwich Fair , some twenty NNS ago , when crowds of NNS used to run down DT hill , I find DT observers MD not take reflection observations for two or three hours after DT crowd had been turned out . . . . PRP do not have anything IN such crowds now , even on bank holidays , and 1 have not heard lateiy of any interference with tile observations . ” ' ' EX is as little foundation for DT calumnious hypothesis WDT DT observers whose reflections were thus agitated had been visiting DT fair themselves as for DT suggestion IN DT above experience of my own took place after luncheon . No . DT truth is DT solid NN is a very elastic solid after all , and Greenwich HiU and DT Observatory and all WDT PRP contained were trembling IN my Highland knoll . DT hOWdah of DT Atlas elephant WDT stands on a tortoise , is a rather rickety structure , and quakes with every jog of DT Titanic beast . But is PRP not being tugged at by every petty planetoid , pulled from its path by every NN , heaved all awry through its yielding bulk by sun and moon in their courses ? PRP is ; but over and above these longer , graver motions EX are incessant tremblings and quiverings in quick periods , measured by seconds or less . This unlooked for sensitiveness to small stresses , this incessant vibration when all obvious disturbing causes are eliminated , are DT JJ facts WDT DT Darwins have so strikingly brought out . How solid rock and massive piers of stone warp under heat and cold IN unseasoned wood ; how a wide stretch of ground MD swey and rise for hours together after a little NN has been poured on PRP ; how DT passage of a train miles away or DT pressing of a finger on DT ground near at hand MD be enough to deflect DT plumb line to a visible degree — these and JJ other JJ phenomena are detailed in DT full and most interesting preliminary report on DT Lunar Disturbance of Gravity , handed in to DT Section of Physics by DT ingenious brothers . DT title reminds PRP IN , as so often in NN . PRP was in looking for CD thing WDT PRP found another . Every CD knows IN as DT NN pulls DT moon round in its monthly orbit , so , too , DT moon . pulls DT NN and everything upon PRP . If a plummet be hung up right under DT moon , so to speak , DT NN is drawing DT bob downward , DT moon very much more feebly pulls PRP upward . DT result is IN DT bob weighs a trifle lighter than if DT moon were abolished . Thanks to DT moon , DT string is leM severely strained . If DT moon be not right overhead , but down a little toward its rising or its setting point , DT bob will be a little drawn aside out of DT straight and DT plummet will no longer give a true plumb line . As DT moon rises , crosses DT sky , and sets , then DT direction of DT plumb line will VB through a small angle . Of course , even when no moon is seen , its silent influence must be felt , and DT plumb line will return to its position by DT NN DT moon is ready to rise again . How small DT NN really is PRP MD gather from DT fact IN with a plummet three hundred yards long , DT travel to and fro of DT bob MD scarcely II this country reach a thousandth of an inch . This is what is meant by DT lunar disturbance of DT direction of gravity : and EX must , of course , be a solar disturbance RB , DT same in kind , but naturally very much smaller in amount . To investigate these disturbances experimentally clearly calls for refined skill and very delicate apparatus ; but Sir William Thomson , to whom instrumental difficulties are always but child 's play , in suggesting DT investigation three NNS ago , had in view DT detection of an influence still more recondite and refined . I have VBN IN DT moon , in pulling aside DT bob of DT plummet , pulls RB on DT NN beneath PRP . If DT NN were perfectly stiff and unyielding , this pull MD have no effect on DT deflection of DT plumb line . But if , as PRP have reason to believe , DT NN yields IN a great viscous mass to great stresses as well as to small ones , a hump of solid NN — a land tide — will travel round DT globe in obedience to DT moon 's attraction . This hump in its course will pass under DT suspended plummet , and DT actual deflections of DT plumb line as observed will no longer agree with those reckoned on DT supposition WDT DT NN is rigid . If PRP had an instrument , then , by which DT minute aberrations of a carefully suspended pendulum , isolated as far as possible from all local disturbance , MD be magnified up to DT point of visibility , PRP should have PRP in our power • “ On an Instrument for Detecting and 'Measuring flmall Changes in DT Direction of Gravity . ” By George H. Darwin . M.A. , F.B S. , late Fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge , and Horace Darwin , M.A. , A.M.I.l:.lS. British Association Report . 1881 .to settle some very pretty points in DT physical theory of DT NN . Such an instrument , after various trials and fail - ures . DT Darwins have erected in DT Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge . A massive stoue , weighing three - quarters of a ton , is bedded in a pit upon DT native gravel . PRP is surrounded by a trench , a foot wide , to isolate PRP completely from DT floor and DT building . DT pendulum is a massive cylinder of pure copper , hung by a brass wire about a yard long . inside a hoRow cylindrical copper support WDT rises from DT stone . A tiny galvanometer mirror is hung by two fine threads , CD of which is fastened to DT bob and DT other to a projection of DT fixed support . This suspension is so arranged IN any movement of DT hob displaces DT mirror to a much greater degree . A ray of light is sent from a distant lamp on to DT mirror , and thence reflected to a scale seven feet away . DT magnification resulting from this double process is something IN 50,010 times . To still and quench accidental tremors , DT hollow copper cylinder is filled up with a mixture of spirits and NN . PRP is a fact , ^^e out hy Poiseuille , IN a boiled mixture of ginand NN is much more viscous and clogs DT motions of bodies immersed in PRP much more effectually than either DT neat gin or DT simple NN . Further to ward off DT effect ' of external changes of temperature , DT whole instrument is immersed in a tank of NN resting on DT stone ; and lastly , after DT precedent of DT Tisbbite , tile surrounding trencb is RB filled up with NN . Thus protected , tbe apparatus might seem sufficiently cut off from local influences , but as a fact its sensitiveness is now so great IN tbe observation has to he carried on in another room by means of a window and a telescope . Standing in DT room itself sixteen feet away , PRP is enough to shih youi ' weight from CD foot to DT other to cause DT speck of ligbt to run along DT scale . DT same result follows if PRP pre^ steadily with your fingers on DT stone edge of DT trench , but PRP MD strike a good sharp blow even on DT stone base without effect . PRP is DT distor - sion of DT soil by slight steady pressure WDT is transmitted through solid gravel aud stone and shows itself as a microscopic deviation of DT pendulum . Such being DT case , DT instrument should he deiicate enough , in all conscience , to determine lunar and even solar disturbances in DT direction of gravity ; but , unfortunately , having got so far , PRP seem almost to have done too much . When regular series of observations are made PRP is found IN DT pendulum is hardly ever steady . DT image on DT seale dances about inceiMantly . DT ground is never really still . Some days PRP MD bequieter than others , and generally EX is evidence of distinct diurnal periods , but DT minor zigzags constantly interrupt and at times reverse for an hour together DT slower march northward or southward . These tremors have been hitherto so persistent and so wildly irregular IN for DT present , at least , DT prospect of unraveling from them DT perturbations due to DT moon does not seem very near . Mr. George Darwin talks of DT probable necessity of building a gravitation observatory at DT bottom of a mine . RB , PRP MD be hoped , DT rail way train and DT market cart will cease from troubling , and DT plummet , save for Ihe steady paces of DT moon , will be at rest . DT work of examining and observing these tremors of DT surface is , however , still VBG on at Cambridge , and idrcady several sharp seasons of microscopic earthquake , unsuspected outside , have been noted . Sometimes a very storm of tremor breaks out for which no sufficient local cause can be traced - . Even so far , DT outcome of these experiments MD prove of high value to practical astronomers . DT piers on which their great telescopes turn are built of solid stone , hitherto regarded as DT material most insusceptible to NN or disturbance . DT Darwins have shown IN such piers are really most sensitive to inequalities of temperature and to small stresses . PRP yield and warp to a most unexpected degree . Tbeir had conducting power is responsible for this in part , and PRP is fruitfully suggested IN PRP might be well to plate DT piers with coppenand to swathe them wi*h flannel . Astronomers , who , to their vexation . have to redetermine DT level of their instruments from hour to hour , and who have long suspected DT occurrence of microscopic earthquakes , will take note of this practical hint .. PRP will make ready use , too , of DT observation here recorded as to DT effect of DT observer 's own weigbt . PRP will VB more of DT drainage of DT soil around their instruments after DT observation on DT irregular and long - continued swelling of ' DT ground WDT results from DT percolation of NN . Meanwhile DT British Association and Cambridge MD be congratulated ( in DT JJ and valuable , field of work thus opened out under their au. ; pices , and especially on their having enlisted DT services and energies of two workers who so worthily keep up DT tradition of an honored name . — London Times ."

PRP has found its way into DT headlines of DT Boston Globe ( “ Vote all PRP VBP . DT secret NN wo n’t VB “ ) and DT NNP York Times ( “ America ’s ‘ Establishment ’ Has Embraced ‘ Deep NNPS ’ “ ) . Heck , PRP has even been talked about on DT NNP Bank ’s blog . This onslaught of attention begs DT question : why now ? Why are so JJ mainstream outlets suddenly shining a light on something WDT has barely been acknowledged in DT past ? To be sure , some of this recent coverage is a whitewash , as PRP MD expect . DT NNP Bank blog , for instance , pawns DT concept off as something to be found in “ newish democracies ” in “ Latin America , Africa , Asia , Eastern Europe and so on , ” i.e. , not in DT West . This qualification –that DT “ deep NN ” idea is something only to be found in foreign , backwards polities –harkens back to DT origins of DT phrase . DT term “ deep NN ” itself is a translation of a Turkish phrase , derin devlet , WDT rose to prominence after DT Susurluk incident exposed DT Turkish secret NN and its NATO / Gladio / drug running / terrorist associations . PRP has become increasingly allowable for opinion makers in DT MSM to cite DT Turkish or DT Egyptian “ deep NN ” as a real phenomenon ( or at least a real possibility ) while simultaneously deriding DT possibility IN PRP exists in DT West . However in recent NNS researchers IN Peter Dale Scott have developed and expanded DT concept to explain how Western political institutions function . This seems to have been picked up by NNS IN Mike Lofgren , a retired Congressional staffer who has described how DT American deep NN involves a cross-party consensus on key political issues , or Philip Giraldi , DT former intelligence agent whose recent musings on DT American deep NN received copious attention from DT mainstream press . CD way to look at this development is as an extension of a phenomenon WDT I noted several NNS ago : a process of indoctrination WDT has begun to inform DT NN IN EX is a shadowy elite in control of DT NN stage and prepare them to accept DT fact . Nearly a decade ago Kissinger mini-me David Rothkopf came out with his book “ Superclass ” revealing DT group of 6,000 or so non-state actors with DT ability to enact policies and further agendas across NN lines . Since DT NN a remarkable number of conspiracies - DT - dare - not - be- mentioned from DT CFR to DT Bilderberg Group to DT Bohemian Grove are now banal political talking points . Whereas mainstream radio hosts once played Twilight Zone music when callers tried to discuss DT CFR , now Hillary NNP blithely admits IN DT NNP Department receives marching orders from them ; whereas DT Bilderberg Group was once subject to a complete NN blackout , PRP now has its own website and press releases . But again : why now ? Partly this has to be due to DT fact IN in DT post - 9/11 , post - Iraq , post - bailout , post - Hope and NNP NN , PRP has become impossible to maintain DT illusion IN PRP is DT political front men who are running DT show . No NN believes this lie anymore , and PRP shows . Even scientific studies are now demonstrating IN DT NNP NNPS is not run by political parties but by pockets of special interest . Truly DT NN toothpaste is out of DT tube and EX ’s no point in trying to put PRP back . While in JJ ways this represents DT crowning achievement of DT tireless efforts of generations of NN researchers who have toiled in relative obscurity , PRP is not an unmitigated good . As PRP will see in DT 2016 prospective this weekend , DT revelation of DT ruling elite coincides with a meltdown of social cohesion WDT is giving rise to dark forces WDT portend a very tumultuous NN . In DT meantime , I ’m interested in your thoughts on this subject . Why do PRP VB DT “ deep NN ” idea is being taken up in DT mainstream now ? Do PRP VB EX is a strategy to these revelations or is PRP a rearguard effort to whitewash DT undeniable ? Corbett Report members are invited to leave your comments below ."

Read_VB the_DT original_JJ article_NN ._.","DT following essay is reprinted with permission from DT Conversation , an online publication covering DT latest research . Ancient and quaint seem DT days of witch crazes , demon scares and tulip manias . Instances of mass hysteria MD strike PRP as rare events in modern advanced societies . But such outbreaks are products of their times . PRP ’re still around today , just in different guises . Aided and abetted by its status as an internet meme , DT myth of an evil , supernatural Slenderman has been panicking adolescents since 2009 , even culminating in an attempted murder by proxy . If PRP ’s easy to brush this off as a case of impressionable teens with too much internet access , then what of otherwise rational late 20th - century American adults participating in suicide cults , Puerto Rico ’s mythical cattle - killing Chupacabra monster , DT “ irrational exuberance ” of DT dot - com bubble in DT 1990s , or DT seemingly insane rush to make bad real estate investments in DT latter 2000s ? As this article is being written , DT U.S. is embroiled in a diplomatic dustup with Cuba WDT has all DT classic symptoms of a collective delusion . DT U.S. NNP Department claims its diplomats in Havana were subjected to “ sonic attacks ” WDT produced a range of physical symptoms including hearing loss , headaches and dizziness . Consequently , DT NNP Department pulled out most of its embassy staff and sent packing most Cuban diplomats stationed in DT U.S. Although post - hoc JJ exams have identified unusual physical conditions in some diplomats , EX is still no direct evidence tying them to DT alleged sonic attacks . Moreover , DT political timing , logistical demands and absence of a plausible technology put DT likelihood of DT attacks at virtually zero . So how do otherwise logical and informed 21st - century NNS fall under DT spell of these mass delusions ? Over DT past several decades , psychologists and sociologists have used examples IN these to dig into when and how this kind of false belief gains traction . Collective delusions are DT culprits behind mass hysterias and related phenomena . As traditionally defined , PRP ’re characterized by a rapid , spontaneous and temporary spread of false beliefs within a circumscribed population . Nowadays DT circumscribed population can be a virtual NN , bounded only by cyberconnections to a shared source of misinformation . DT recent upsurge in vocal flat - NNP proponents , for example , is not DT result of geographical neighbors whipping each other into a near frenzy . Social NN makes PRP easy to find IN - minded others , serve distorted information to DT curious , and stir up excitement about events such as DT 2017 eclipse , celebrity endorsements , and a proposed rocket launch by a flat - NNP proponent intended to prove once and for all IN PRP are all living on a disc . Collective delusions emerge under a combination of several conditions . Each of these precursors is straightforward enough , but PRP ’s harder to foresee when PRP might occur in concert . In turn , this makes predicting delusional outbreaks a very inexact NN . DT most obvious precursor is DT presence of multiple NNS who are sufficiently connected so as to share information or experiences . Second , just as an isolated individual MD develop some beliefs and behaviors WDT depart from prevailing norms , collective delusions and responses are more likely to occur in relatively insular groups or networks . Third , a collective delusion is more likely to take hold if DT group is undergoing some kind of distress . This MD be rising unemployment , political destabilization or an enemy ’s threats of warfare . On a smaller scale , a town MD lose a crucial employer , or a fire - and - brimstone minister can instigate a satanic panic with rumors of baby - killing cults . And fourth , DT stressors are potent enough to trigger , in at least some individuals , either a psychosomatic response or scapegoating behavior . Psychosomatic reactions — physical symptoms with psychological causes — MD be as mild as itching or as severe as blindness . Scapegoating involves blaming a group of innocent ( or possibly nonexistent ) others for causing problems — psychosomatic or otherwise . When conditions are ripe , this catalyzing subset of group members sets off a chain reaction . PRP begin to seek and identify external causes for their distress , or sources for its relief . Psychosomatic responses spread ; contempt for DT scapegoats grows . NNS become hypervigilant and toss critical thinking out DT window , looking for and finding imagined threats . NN theories are spawned , angels and demons invoked , fears stoked , panic induced . DT supernatural MD start to seem natural . As more and more group members become ensnared in a positive feedback loop , DT perceived threat is legitimized , only broadening and deepening social distress further . Because PRP are inherently newsworthy , mass delusions are picked up by mass NN which fan DT flames even more . In these ways , a nonexistent threat can set off a self - sustaining cascade of irrationality WDT lasts until DT perceived threat recedes . Delusion everywhere , to different degrees ? While descriptions of mass hysterias make great reading , PRP represent only DT far end of a continuum of what sociologists VBP me call social diffusion processes . For DT most part , these are quite mundane — PRP might recognize a few from your own daily life . While around DT NN stock market bubbles and bank runs make NN , less frenetic responses to perceived threats and conspiracies abound : DT 9/11 “ truthers , ” DT recent uptick in flat - NNP beliefs , fears of gluten and genetically modified foods , NN NN deniers , wars on NN on some liberal college campuses , and more . Even DT desire to be fashionable can be seen as a response to DT fear of being excluded . Simple mathematical equations can quite elegantly describe DT speed , duration and extensiveness of DT spread of beliefs and behaviors . A typical “ diffusion model ” shows how DT penetration through a population of such things as beliefs , behaviors , illnesses , innovations or products is determined by just a few parameters . These typically include DT group ’s size , DT density of its members ’ interconnections and DT inherent contagiousness of DT thing being spread . Irrational beliefs , and DT often ill - considered responses PRP engender , can spread IN an infection across groups as large as nations or as small as nuclear families . Sunshine , as PRP say , is DT best disinfectant . Social impact theory MD suggest IN DT best approach to administering social disinfectant is via large numbers of geographically nearby , authoritative nonbelievers . In DT case of DT supposed sonic attacks in Cuba , CD approach to stemming DT scare MD be a rapidly deployed on - site investigation by acoustic experts , neurologists , psychiatrists and military strategists . A folklorist as well MD n’t hurt . Short of such a full - frontal counterattack , disseminating easy - to - digest skeptical information as early as possible in DT process MD help to slow DT diffusion process and quell DT mass delusion . PRP ’s easy enough to be caught up in a mass delusion . Fads and fashions are great examples , though their most harmful consequence MD be our embarrassment when PRP look back on some of our previous style choices . As long as NNS are stressed and living in groups , most of our mass delusions will remain invisible to PRP until PRP have already run their course .

When standing on DT ground , what ’s VBG on to affect how far NNS can see ? PRP ’s things IN : • your eyesight , including DT NN and function of DT eye itself • DT size of DT object WDT PRP ’re viewing • DT curvature of DT NNP • any obstructions in your line of sight Let ’s take a look at these influences to understand how DT human eye can see as far as PRP does . DT phrase “ visual acuity ” refers to DT clarity of your vision . Experts consider normal , or healthy , visual acuity to be 20 / 20 vision . DT simply means IN PRP can clearly see something 20 feet away WDT PRP should be able to see from DT distance . If PRP have 20/100 vision , PRP MD still be able to see an object clearly from 20 feet away , but someone with normal vision MD see PRP clearly from 100 feet . Conversely , if PRP have 20 / 12 vision , PRP can see something clearly at 20 feet WDT most NNS need to be 12 feet from to see clearly . How does DT eye process images ? When PRP look at anything , a rapid and complex sequence of actions will take place in DT eye and brain : • Light reflects off an object and passes through DT cornea , which is DT transparent outer layer of DT eye . • DT cornea bends DT light rays to allow them to enter DT pupil , or DT dark center of DT eye . • At DT same NN , DT muscles in DT iris — DT colored area around DT pupil — control DT size of DT pupil , making PRP smaller in bright light and larger in a darker setting . • Light rays then pass through DT lens , which sharpens them as PRP reach DT retina , DT thin tissue layer at DT back of DT eye WDT contains tiny nerve cells known as rods and cones . • DT rods and cones convert DT light rays into electrical impulses , and these travel from DT eye through DT optic nerve to DT brain , which converts them into images . Assuming IN all of DT body parts and processes WDT are necessary for clear vision are working normally , then DT limitations on how far PRP can see come down to : • DT size of DT object WDT PRP ’re viewing NNS often use DT term “ sightline ” in a theater to describe DT line of sight from an audience member ’s seat to DT stage . But , a sightline is really any uninterrupted visual angle from a person ’s eyes to what DT person is trying to see . Aside from obvious visual obstructions IN trees , buildings , and clouds , EX ’s CD major factor WDT can reduce your sightline : DT curvature of DT NNP . DT NNP curves about 8 inches per mile . As a result , on a flat surface with your eyes 5 feet or so off DT ground , DT farthest edge WDT PRP can see is about 3 miles away . To put PRP another way , if PRP ’re standing on a beach in Florida or driving past DT farms of Nebraska ( both places where PRP ’s relatively flat ) , DT farthest part of DT horizon WDT PRP can see is about 3 miles away . If PRP were lying down on DT beach with your head less than a foot off DT ground , your eyes MD be able to see about a mile out over DT NN . However , if your vantage point were much higher off DT ground , then DT horizon line MD be a lot farther away . DT curvature of DT NNP MD n’t start to cut things off from your view quite so soon . Let ’s say your drive through Nebraska took PRP to Scotts Bluff National Monument , and PRP climbed to DT summit at 4,659 feet . From here , PRP MD see Laramie Peak , which is about 100 miles away in Wyoming , according to DT National Park Service . DT ’s on a clear day . PRP ’s not limitless , but PRP ’s pretty far . Consider DT constellation Lyra and its brightest star Vega , which is about 25 light NNS from NNP . Without a telescope or any other visual aid , Vega looks IN a little candle flame in DT night sky . DT got NNS wondering : How far away MD PRP be from an actual candle flame on NNP and still see PRP DT way PRP see Vega ? NNS measure DT brightness of stars by magnitude . A pair of researchers from Texas A&M University did some experiments and concluded IN a candle flame from about 1,286 feet away MD have a brightness similar to DT of Vega . To take their research a little further — and farther — DT NNS experimented to determine DT maximum distance PRP MD be from a candle flame to see PRP at all . DT researchers decided IN someone with healthy vision MD detect a candle flame from about 1.6 miles away , assuming IN EX was no fog or other obstructions . DT moon is about 238,900 miles away , and PRP ’s easy to see some of its craters , valleys , and plains on a cloudless night . Even closer to home , DT view from Mount Everest in DT Himalayas — DT NN ’s tallest summit at about 29,000 feet above NN level — offers a view of close to 211 miles in every direction , according to a user - generated map . Due to DT elevation though , clouds often obscure DT view . DT 124th floor of DT Burj Khalifa in Dubai , which is DT NN ’s tallest building at more than 2,700 feet , offers a view of about 50 miles on a clear day , Reuters reports . DT nearly literal skyscraper can RB provide visitors with two sunsets a day , according to an article in DT DT Daily Mail . If PRP VBP your elevator ride to DT top just right , PRP can see DT sun setting over DT horizon . PRP can then catch DT sun again a little later , as DT curvature of DT NNP and DT amazing building height conspire to keep PRP looking to DT west ."

Among human achievements , DT moon landing is CD WDT a sliver of society holds in their hearts as a hoax . Other topics , IN DT true age of DT NNP , NNS , and NN NN are hotly debated subjects . According to DT NN community , PRP ’s background noise clogging DT airwaves . Scholars say an understanding of NN is vital to an informed society , but EX are gaps between DT source , dissemination , and comprehension of DT information . Last week , Atlanta rapper B.o.B. ( real name Bobby Ray Simmons , Jr. ) tweeted to his 2.3 million Twitter followers IN he can prove DT NNP is flat based on DT lack of curvature of DT horizon . DT began a short - lived beef with famed astrophysicist Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson , who debunked B.o.B. on DT Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore , calling PRP “ a symptom of a larger problem . ” “ EX 's a growing anti-intellectual strain in this country WDT MD be DT beginning of DT end of our informed democracy , ” Tyson VBD . “ Of course , in a free society , PRP can and should VB whatever PRP VBP . If PRP VBP to VB DT NN is flat , VB right ahead , but if PRP VBP DT NN is flat , and PRP have influence over others , as with successful rappers , or even presidential candidates , then being wrong becomes being harmful to DT NN , wealth , and security of our citizenry . ” Tyson intentionally did a “ mic drop ” before walking off stage . B.o.B. is far from alone . NN literacy is relatively low in DT NNP NNPS and other NNS . Read More : NNS Do n’t Cause NN . So What Does ? » NN Literacy Not DT Best in DT U.S . According to DT National NNP Foundation , most Americans VBP DT NNP travels around DT sun but are n’t familiar with DT basics of DT scientific method . A Pew Research Center survey of 3,278 adults found most Americans have a decent understanding of basic scientific information , such as DT NNP ’s core is DT hottest layer . Other complicated concepts , IN why DT boiling point of NN in higher altitudes occurs at a lower temperature , are tougher for them to grasp . These are subjects WDT should be covered in high school . JJ ideas , findings , or technology , however , are even harder to permeate society . Adam Ruben , Ph.D. , a molecular biologist and author who has taught classes on DT NN ’s perception of NN at Johns Hopkins University , VBD issues IN in vitro fertilization and genetically modified crops are often wrought with misunderstanding — as if NNS are making Frankenstein ’s monster . “ PRP ’s true NNS do n’t understand NN . DT great thing about NN is IN PRP does n’t require belief , ” Ruben told Healthline . “ EX ’s always VBG to be a contingent of society , no matter DT technology , IN views changes made to DT way nature functions as bad . ” NN requires a certain level of skepticism in DT name of discovery , but PRP RB involves not ignoring data and facts to come to a conclusion . “ When PRP hear a JJ discovery , your reaction should n’t be to immediately dismiss PRP , and no scientist MD VB PRP to blindly accept PRP , ” Ruben VBD . “ Your reaction should be to VB to learn more about PRP . ” Of all DT NN fallacies out RB , Ruben assures NNS NNS do not cause NN . He should VB ; he works on a NN for malaria . But DT discomfort of watching a stranger ( i.e. nurse or doctor ) stabbing his kids with needles does make him feel IN a rotten dad . “ Now as a parent , I can see why NNS MD n’t VB to vaccinate their kids , ” he VBD . John Pellino , associate director of DT Talcott Mountain NNP Center , says EX are a slew of issues at play in DT NN ’s view of NN . These include authority , shortcuts in translation in DT NN , how humans VBP to reduce complexity , and IN NNS prefer a familiar problem to a novel solution . “ DT goes for NN , relationships , cars , pets , all sorts of things , ” Pellino told Healthline . “ NN is hard . NN involves mental and physical work , and according to models of brain physiology , PRP actually re-wire neural networks in your brain matter to do this . No small task biologically , but PRP can actually do this sort of amazing brain morphing thing . ” All of these factors create a perfect storm of assumptions , comfort , and simplification , Pellino added . “ If PRP leave PRP at DT , PRP can live a simple life with some potential disasters from false assumptions . If PRP push beyond PRP — something humans are famous for — PRP can live an amazingly exhilarating life with JJ discoveries around every bend , ” he VBD . “ DT ’s DT feeling WDT makes PRP worth PRP all for NNS in NN , nature , and engineering — DT chance IN PRP ’ll be DT first to DT JJ , really JJ , thing . ” Anca Ioviţă , a physician in Romania , VBD when NNS have an opportunity to learn , formal or not , PRP can become “ addicted to illusions ” as a way to deal with their own mortality . “ DT is why afterlife stories or VB - rich - quick scams are so popular . Or alternative medicine WDT promises PRP a cancer cure WDT is CD check apart , ” she told Healthline . “ And no matter how much NN and medicine will progress , mortality and our own awareness of PRP will always exist . Hence , quacks will always have a job . ” Read More : Immune Systems Now a Focus of Cancer Treatments » For some , PRP ’s overwhelming to grasp DT NNP is actually billions of NNS old or IN humans share a common ancestor with apes . David Bell — a Catholic , licensed counselor , and former Air Force researcher — says ego MD play into DT disbelief PRP were created just as random bits in DT universe . “ PRP are obviously special in some way , as evidenced by all of DT things PRP have accomplished in this NN , both bad and good . No other species has even come close , ” he told Healthline . “ This does make PRP special . This naturally leads CD to wonder , why are PRP special ? What made PRP special ? DT non -believer will simply say PRP was luck , but DT believer will say IN our Creator made PRP special . ” Bell says EX are numerous psychological issues at play when NNS do n’t believe certain things to be true . DT includes confirmation bias , where PRP only seek knowledge WDT supports our pre-existing beliefs . DT existence of God , Bell says , is CD thing NN will never be able to answer because PRP ’s not something WDT can be measured . “ NN is about how things work and VBP . Religion is about why things exist in DT first place , ” he VBD . “ PRP are complementary areas of NN , where each can inform DT other , but neither can dismiss DT other . ” So How Do PRP Improve NN Literacy ? Besides improving NN education in schools , scientific communication is crucial . JJ scientific research reaches DT NN through DT filter of DT NN , which NNS feel often sensationalizes findings in headlines . In a 2009 survey of more than 2,500 NNS , about three - quarters say DT NN does a poor job of distinguishing well - founded NN , while about half say NN oversimplification of scientific findings is a major problem . Outspoken NNS IN Tyson , Bill Nye , and Michio Kaku have inspired generations of JJ NNS through NN education in DT NN . Ruben , who watched “ Mr. Wizard ” growing up and now co-hosts DT NNP Channel ’s “ Outrageous Acts of NNP , ” VBD more NNS need to communicate more with those outside of scientific research . “ PRP do have a shortage of NNS who are watched by non-scientists , ” he VBD . RB , Ruben noted , is DT capability for inaccurate information to spread easily via social NN without verifying its accuracy . “ PRP can share with CD click , ” he VBD . “ Reading takes NN . ” Non-scientists ’ influence in DT NN continues to VB air NN IN Fox NNP host Bill O’Reilly saying EX ’s no way to explain tides . Or , as Tyson alluded to , presidential candidate Donald NNP spreading inaccurate information on issues from JJ NN to DT Ebola NN . JJ experts , including Bell and Pellino , say these kinds of debates in DT NN are merely attention - seeking grabs at fame . In DT case of DT flat NNP theory , who ’s DT better source of information ? A rapper who dropped out of school in DT ninth grade or DT guy studying astrophysics since high school ?

By_IN the_DT way_NN ,_, I_PRP still_RB cannot_MD believe_VB I_PRP had_VBD to_TO write_VB this_DT ._.","PRP is stunning IN I have to write this article , but I do . A popular rapper has launched a GoFundMe to prove IN DT NNP is flat . Several professional basketball players have RB weighed in with their perspective . DT picture of NNP below is pretty definitive , but EX are basic meteorological "" pieces of evidence "" too . Herein , I explore three of DT most important ones . Sunsets : Have PRP ever watched a sunset ? If so , PRP is a compelling "" duh "" WDT DT NNP is not flat . If PRP observe DT horizon at sunset , typically DT sun disappears from your view in a bottom - up direction . In a very simple experiment described on DT PBS website , This fact is how ancient sailors knew IN NNP was spherical ( and DT fact IN PRP did not sail off of some mythical edge ) . As DT sun falls increasingly below DT horizon , more of DT shorter wavelength light is scattered out as PRP travels through more of DT atmosphere . This scattering leaves DT longer wavelength colors of reddish - orange . General circulation of DT atmosphere : PRP is intuitive to most NNS IN PRP is warm in DT tropical regions of DT NN and cool in DT polar regions . Because of DT NNP 's curvature , DT mid-section of NNP receives more of DT direct radiation from DT sun . This means IN EX is more heat concentrated in DT tropical atmosphere and ocean . DT NASA satellite maps below illustrate IN this radiation imbalance is prevalent irrespective of season . DT NNP is continually trying to remove DT excess heat in DT tropics . CD way IN NNP tries to put itself on a "" heat "" diet to remove excess heat in DT mid-section is through poleward - moving ocean currents . A good example in DT NNP NNPS is DT Gulf Stream . PRP is a warm , poleward flowing current . Hurricanes are another mechanism WDT transports excess heat from DT tropics to DT poles . DT general circulation of DT atmosphere RB evolves because of DT net imbalance of heating . In its simplest form , DT air rises over DT warmer tropics and sinks over DT cooler polar regions . This is a thermally - direct circulation . In reality , PRP is a bit more complex as described on NOAA website , Since DT NN rotates , DT axis is tilted , and EX is more land mass in DT northern hemisphere than in DT southern hemisphere , DT actual JJ pattern is much more complicated . Instead of CD large circulation between DT poles and DT equator , EX are three circulations . ( 1 ) Hadley cell - Low latitude air movement toward DT equator WDT with heating , rises vertically , with poleward movement in DT upper atmosphere . This forms a convection cell WDT dominates tropical and sub-tropical climates . ( 2 ) Ferrel cell - A mid-latitude mean atmospheric circulation cell for weather named by Ferrel in DT 19th century . In this cell DT air flows poleward and eastward near DT surface and equatorward and westward at higher levels . ( 3 ) Polar cell - Air rises , diverges , and travels toward DT poles . Once over DT poles , DT air sinks , forming DT polar highs . At DT surface air diverges outward from DT polar highs . Surface winds in DT polar cell are easterly ( polar easterlies ) . This general circulation model is directly tied to JJ patterns of high - low pressure , jet streams , and weather systems . Weather radar : I cut my teeth as a radar meteorologist . Some of my earliest graduate work at Florida NNP University developed weather radar algorithms to track hurricanes . I RB teach a radar and mesoscale meteorology course at DT University of Georgia . CD of DT fundamental concepts WDT PRP discuss is how curvature of DT NNP impacts rainfall detection . DT example at a National Weather Service website describes PRP well , A storm between DT Birmingham ( BMX ) and Maxwell AFB ( MXX ) radars ( see image below ) . If DT storm is a good distance away from BMX , due to DT fact IN DT radar beam is straight and does n't follow DT NNP 's surface , DT lowest elevation scan from BMX MD only be able to "" see "" into DT middle portion of DT storm . If DT same storm is closer to MXX , this will allow PRP to "" look "" into DT lower portion of DT same storm , possibly allowing PRP to detect a rotational couplet closer to DT NNP 's surface . From this , PRP MD infer IN given DT right circumstances , DT formation of a tornado is possible . By DT way , I still cannot believe I had to write this ."

A precise topographical map has been made of CD of DT flattest places on NNP : DT salar de Uyuni , a vast plain of white cemented salt in DT mountains of Bolivia . DT ground survey , aided by JJ positioning systems ( GPS ) , shows variations in elevation of less than a metre across an area almost half DT size of Wales . Intriguingly , DT work reveals bumps in DT salt WDT lie above lumps of dense rock buried several kilometres below , just as NN will bulge over a bump on DT ocean floor . Knowing exactly where these bumps lie will help researchers to use DT flat as a giant calibration device for satellite - based radar and laser altimeters . Adrian Borsa , a geophysicist at DT NNP Geological Survey in Pasadena , California , led DT work WDT is now reporting DT most precise GPS characterization yet of DT salt flat , accurate to 2.2 centimetres . Borsa and his colleagues began DT research in 2002 , with a campaign WDT combined data from fixed GPS stations with ‘ kinematic GPS ’ data obtained by crisscrossing DT salar in trucks fitted with GPS antennae . “ PRP ’s as if PRP ’re on a white ocean with no waves , ” says Borsa . “ PRP see DT horizon , DT curvature of NNP . PRP ’s absolutely featureless . ” DT NN was commissioned specifically as a way to calibrate NASA ’s ICESat , launched in 2003 to VB NN sheets in Antarctica and Greenland . Satellites can calibrate their altimeters by bouncing signals off DT ocean surface , DT height of which is well established . But because of atmospheric interference , tides and waves , EX are uncertainties . Borsa says DT salar , now so accurately mapped and with dry , clear skies , is about five times better than DT ocean as a reference point . DT results have been helpful , says Sinead Farrell , a researcher at DT NNP National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is using ICESat to measure changes in NN NN . “ PRP ’s DT first calibration surface WDT PRP look at , ” she says . “ DT information WDT PRP provide is useful to all DT other teams . ” She adds IN DT salt flat is RB being used for Envisat , a European satellite , and MD be used to calibrate future orbiters such as Cryosat - 2 , a planned European NN - monitoring mission . Whereas DT NNP - observing community likes DT flatness of DT salar , geologists are interested in DT tiny undulations . DT strength of gravity varies from place to place around NNP — imperceptibly to humans but in ways WDT NNS have mapped precisely — owing to DT density of objects nearby . Borsa found IN DT salt had created faint mounds of some 40 centimetres in height over regions of slightly higher gravity , owing to high - density volcanic rocks kilometres below . “ PRP found a rare breed of topography , ” says Borsa , who says IN this is DT first NN a land surface has been shown to undulate in step with DT gravitational field IN this . “ Here ’s a place where PRP see DT imprint of DT gravitational field due to buried mountain ranges . ” Borsa has a theory as to how this happened . When DT salar floods , as PRP does every five NNS or so , salt dissolves and , in solution , flows to regions of higher gravity , he says . This phenomenon is already known to oceanographers : DT free - standing ocean surface changes slightly to match DT pull of gravity underneath . So EX are slight bulges in DT ocean in places directly above submarine seamounts . “ PRP VBP IN ocean surfaces follow DT gravitational potential surface : DT geoid , ” says Farrell , who was not a part of DT NN . “ PRP is a JJ result to show IN DT salt flat RB follows DT geoid . ” DT next step for those with a geological interest , Borsa says , is to take out DT portion of DT elevation variations WDT are due to gravity and see what ’s left . So far , he is seeing a strange , regularly patterned checkerboard surface . He does n’t VB what MD produce PRP , but speculates IN PRP MD reflect DT imprint of periodic pressures due to prevailing winds . Working out DT forces WDT produce this pattern MD be useful if similar phenomena are ever spotted on another NN , he says . “ Now PRP ’ve got an analogue on NNP . ”"

How to communicate effectively ? Who knows how PRP ’ve experienced a sense of community in other dimensions , once upon a long NN ago ? PRP MD all live with a cellular / DNA – memory of unity and oneness from an existence before DT start of DT veiling process . A memory in and of Awakening . PRP seems IN now , after living with a “ horizontal ” consciousness expansion , limited by DT concept of material expansion on a NN seemingly existing as a self - contained life form , first as a flat NNP , than as a globe and centre of “ DT Universe ” ( yet unseen ) after Galilei ’s exclamation “ And yet she ’s round ! ” As a celestial body circling around DT Sun , with other space - bodies forming DT Solar System as yet another part of DT entire Galaxy , in our technologically more advanced NN , observed through DT eyes of cameras , PRP ’re all touched and affected by a storm of NN WDT is in progress at a 90 degree angle : a “ vertical ” consciousness expansion in much tumult , clanging and banging , much topsy turvy . I choose a direction North - South for ease of understanding dimensional shifts in sync with DT term “ Ascension ” which means to JJ religious NNS “ rising up to DT heavens ” with images illustrating a figure carried on DT weightless substance of clouds . When rising above DT quirkiness of personal styles in approach and awake and alert to DT vagueness of presence and intention ( in virtual communications ) PRP can step forward and connect by addressing DT issues WDT are rising within PRP , communicating our feelings and DT experience of how actions of others affect PRP and how PRP feel our own actions affect others . By being informed about their impact on others who make an effort to offer feedback , honouring their own value as much as DT value of DT person on DT other side of DT screen , or table . DT desire IN PRP ’s presence matters in a community , can lead to different expressions , depending on a force of will , making a point for DT sake of fanatism , a need for attention or competition , by challenging an authority , or a warm - hearted service as a means to fulfilment of PRP ’s own desire in sync with PRP ’s desire to serve a general sense of wellbeing in all . Issues WDT are rising between 2 NNS , showing up in their CD - on - CD communication online , or in DT practice of working together in DT physical NN , should best be kept in DT close encounter of a duet . PRP takes two to tango and not CD or more than 2 , for is n’t stepping on each other ’s toes sufficient pain to pay attention properly ? To me , PRP ’s an interesting subject to discuss community - creation and without expecting PRP or others here to address all of them , here are a couple of questions : – How does PRP look IN , your favoured community ? How MD PRP describe your life in PRP ? – What makes or breaks a community ? – What ’s DT difference in a virtual and physical community ? If EX ’s CD at all . – What ’s causing members of a community to feel inspired and at ease ? – What ’s required to maintain a community in liveliness and sparkly vibes , open to NN ? – Should EX be an intention and foundation on which a community is built and functioning ? – Should a community - to - be start with a gathering of NNS at random , spontaneously / casually formed ? – Is a community a work in progress , with a common interest showing up in due NN , which my become DT core of an intentional community ? – Should a community grow organically , by a coming and VBG of members without a fixed plan for an “ end- product ” or “ end-result ? ” – Are members of a community open to leaving and trying out different forms of communities ? – Should a community be a living organism WDT is in motion and NN always . Moving around freely nd explore different forms of community is a great learning curve in my perception . When a genuine attempt is made to VB , attune and learn . Use of discernment can be trained due to a variety of experiences and encounters with NNS of all walks of life and even ET - races . In DT latter case communication becomes a whole JJ concept , I imagine . To me , DT form and subject of a chosen service are two very different things . – Is transparency of decision making and reports of financial manoeuvers to all members of a community , who contribute financially , a must and a benefit ?

Apple VBD PRP will use recycled rare earths in its “ Taptic Engine , ” a part WDT lets iPhones mimic a physical button click despite being a flat pane of glass . DT part is about CD - quarter of DT rare NN elements inside DT iPhone models . Rare earths , a group of 17 specialized minerals , have become a flash point in trade tensions between DT NNP NNPS and NNP . DT elements are used in weapons , consumer electronics and other goods . NNP dominates DT processing of DT raw minerals , and has implied through its NN - controlled NN WDT PRP MD restrict rare earths sales to DT NNP NNPS , just as PRP did to Japan after a diplomatic dispute in 2010 . Lisa Jackson , Apple ’s vice NN of environment , policy and social initiatives , VBD Apple ’s use of recycled rare earths was “ not related ” to trade tensions but MD help PRP maintain a steady supply . “ This is CD of those happy coincidences where what is good for DT NN is really good for business at DT same NN , ” Jackson told Reuters . “ CD of DT things PRP talk about a lot internally , just in general , is how much more resilient this makes our supply chain . ” In consumer electronics , rare earths reside in tiny speakers and actuators . DT parts are so small IN collecting them for recycling is difficult and expensive . For now , Apple will use recycled rare earths from an outside supplier , not from previously used iPhones . Apple declined to name DT supplier or say what products DT rare earths were recovered from , though DT company did say DT source was post - industrial , meaning material generated during manufacturing processes rather than from discarded consumer products . Jackson VBD IN Apple ’s scale - JJ iPhone models are typically sell tens of millions of units per NN - helped make DT project economically viable . “ PRP have essentially made a market for this entrepreneur , this innovator , who found a way to recycle rare earths , ” Jackson VBD . Kyle Wiens , DT chief executive of iFixit , a company focused on repairing and reusing electronics , VBD Apple ’s move was a first for DT industry . “ Rare NN elements are n’t being recycled from electronics right now , and DT ’s a huge problem — NNP has a stranglehold on DT virgin material supply , ” Wiens VBD . “ This is a great idea — Apple MD single - handedly create a hugely needed market for recycled rare earths . ” Apple often aims to reuse parts from its old devices . Apple VBD on Wednesday IN aluminum from enclosures recovered through its trade - in programs will be melted down and made into JJ MacBook Air laptop computers . DT company previously disclosed IN cobalt recovered from iPhone batteries disassembled by robots at its recycling labs in Texas is put into JJ iPhone batteries . Apple is experimenting with ways to recover rare earths from its phones using its robots , which can remove tiny parts and separate them into collection bins to aggregate enough material to make recycling viable . DT company is RB researching ways IN conventional recyclers , who shred devices and separate out DT various materials , MD tweak their lines to recover DT elements , information WDT Jackson VBD Apple is open to sharing . “ EX are some innovations of ours WDT PRP actually VBP NNS to copy . So as much as possible - as long as PRP does n’t give away some of our other design and engineering innovation - PRP are happy to bring along DT recycling industry , ” Jackson VBD . “ PRP have started to be much more transparent around this technology development than PRP usually are . ”"

Gonna teach PRP about DT Monster today ! Instead of my usual review of DT week , I ’m VBG to put up for your reading pleasure , five of my articles PRP MD , or MD not have seen from DT five hundred sum odd pieces DT Tea Party Tribune has been kind enough to publish for me over DT last three NNS . When PRP write an article PRP tend to VB PRP ’s a masterpiece . I bury “ Easter Eggs ” in every NN . A good example of DT is in “ NNP Baby and DT Trip To Bountiful , ” where in CD line I replaced “ DT Principal ” with DT words “ DT Principle ” alluding to polygamy . PRP got by a lot of NNS but DT principal who let my grandson VB skipping across Main Street in Brigham City got my point , and he ’s been mad ever since . Sorry for Party rocking Dude ! I RB include at least CD mistake for liberals who search my stuff to challenge my literacy . An PRP ’s for its or a comma for a period . For every fifty to CD hundred articles WDT are penned , PRP will be DT “ monster ! ” While on a typical run an article will struggle for reads , these certain works will take off a bit faster . Then PRP ’ll notice a comment later on DT article , but not from DT Trib . PRP ’ll come from USA Today , or some other publication where part or all of DT article was used or cited . DT ’s when PRP VBP back and check DT numbers and VBD article will move into DT “ DAYUM ” section . These five are those types of works . I did n’t learn journalism in any college . I learned to spin a yarn in Nashville . DT same methods WDT make a song “ cook ” will chicken fry an article . Methods UH make a point and return to PRP toward DT end to reinforce DT theme . Do n’t keep repeating “ ands ” and “ buts . ” Write IN PRP speak . I do n’t have a big problem with spelling because I ’m ignorant and do n’t use a whole lot of big words . I try not to lie . . . much , but I ’ll use innuendo to worm around a subject or person ( such as DT principal ) to make my point . FYI : DT reason my five NN old grand baby got out in DT street unsupervised was he was too infatuated with a certain teacher . Little light hearted jab on an embarrassing era of Mormon history , add a dash of innuendo and voila ! Principal soup ! But PRP VBP I ’m bad . While I ’m on DT subject , I VBP to explain why I pick on Mormons so often . Even though I ’m an old “ Reptile Bait ” I ’ve been covered UP with Latter Day Saints for over thirty NNS . My wife ’s and for DT matter my daughter in law ’s family are Temple Worthy all DT way back to Joseph Smith . I did write Joseph Did PRP VB about DT Mormon culture , and I ’m fascinated with their history , but if I ever stepped into a Temple my hair MD catch on fire . I use DT same method when addressing race baiters , Political Correctness , and NNS who are confused by common sense . I read my stuff out loud . DT ’s an old songwriter ’s trick . My friends VBP I ’m crazy because I always seem to be talking to myself . If PRP wo n’t roll smoothly off your tongue PRP will irritate or confuse DT reader . Finding subjects to write about is not hard . I can actually write about things I VBP very little of . When I began to write for Raging Elephants Radio on Doc Greene ’s show I actually knew very little about DT Texas movements of secession and nullification . In NN I learned , but for about six months PRP was mostly style , style , style . I do research . Usually on YouTube . I will sometimes spend up to a week familiarizing myself with a subject before I write anything about PRP . CD subject I never MD really cope with was DT Flat NNP Society . I tried , but I simply MD n’t drink enough whiskey to make any sense out of PRP . I try not to rag on DT Cartels or Muslims too much because I do n’t VB to VB bombed or shot . DT all having been VBN , I VBP PRP will enjoy these pieces . IN a hit song I MD feel them coming off my pen , so to speak . Each NN directly addresses some facet of DT human experience . Each NN promoted itself to DT “ DAYUM ” status . I do n’t buy into inspiration but I will say these five came out of nowhere , so I guess EX is someone out RB looking out for PRP . PRP has been my honor and my joy to share with PRP guys and gals . DT Best Is Yet To Come About ( TLB ) Contributor Bill and DT gang at DT Butcher Shop DT Butcher Shop is an alternative NN source based in DT Tea Party Tribune with an eye on God , family , and preservation of America . PRP is a collection of minds started by Bill DT Butcher , a conservative op / ed journalist who began publishing forty NNS ago . PRP strive to make DT articles informative , entertaining , and diverse . All PRP see will cause PRP to stop and consider . PRP try not to drone on with DT same old day after day clap trap WDT MD have driven PRP away from mainstream NN . PRP will read things here IN PRP will see nowhere else . PRP are from London to Austin to DT Escalanté . So , what ’s your cut of meat ? Shop around . DT Butcher Shop is happy to fill your order . DT Liberty Beacon Project is now expanding at a near exponential rate , and for this PRP are grateful and excited ! But PRP must RB be practical . For 7 NNS PRP have not asked for any donations , and have built this project with our own funds as PRP grew . PRP are now experiencing ever increasing growing pains due to DT large number of websites and projects PRP represent .

When PRP check their e-mail , PRP do PRP on their phones , not their computers ; when PRP make phone calls , PRP do PRP on their computers via Skype , not their phones . PRP can see why other writers let this stuff slide . PRP have to come up with JJ kinds of stories in a networked NN . DT usual missed connections and mistaken identities do n't cut PRP  how JJ Shakespearean tragedies MD have been averted with GPS and Facebook ? Not IN PRP do n't have problems now , God knows , but when PRP take our modern technological predicament seriously , PRP realize IN those old problems have to be rerouted , and IN DT stories have to VB shape accordingly . PRP start to become less about missed connections and more about overconnectedness . PRP start to look IN Reamde . Reamde is Stephenson 's 10th novel ( not counting his occasional collaborations and DT unclassifiable online fiction project DT Mongoliad ) , and he has yet to write an uninteresting NN . In Reamde PRP find him slimming down to middleweight after five straight heavyweight bouts : DT cryptographical epic Cryptonomicon , DT 2,500 - page three - novel Baroque Cycle and then Anathem , a philosophical novel set on an alt - universe NN where monasteries are consecrated to higher mathematics . Stephenson 's abiding preoccupation is information flow , and how information shapes DT lives of DT humans around and through whom PRP flows . He is generally tagged as a NN - fiction novelist , but IN categorization is difficult to support on DT evidence  DT Baroque Cycle was set in DT 17th and 18th centuries and stuck to existing history , more or less . ( Isaac Newton is a major character ; DT action turns on his little - known role as Master of DT Mint . ) "" NN fiction "" describes Stephenson 's interests , but not his methods . While recognizably Stephensonian , Reamde is less about DT flow of information through JJ networks than PRP is about DT flow of bullets out of guns . This is , first and foremost , a Bourne - style international thriller , and as such its intellectual sites are set lower than those of its immediate predecessors . DT hero of Reamde is  or at first appears to be  Richard Forthrast , founder of a NNP of Warcraftesque massively multiplayer fantasy game called T'Rain . Richard is an amiable enough guy in his 50s , living in Seattle , with way too much money and way too little in DT way of emotional or , for DT matter , physical connections to DT NN around him . This changes when he hires his niece Zula , an Eritrean refugee adopted by his sister , and takes a mentor 's interest in her . Zula is a crack programmer but not , PRP turns out , a crack picker of boyfriends . Hers sells stolen information to some Russian gangsters , and DT deal goes south when a NN from T'Rain called Reamde  DT intentional typo stops bothering PRP after a while , though PRP does n't VB easier to pronounce  encrypts DT data . DT gangsters promptly kidnap DT boyfriend and Zula and head off in search of DT NN writer , who 's got an IP address in NNP , specifically in DT city of Xiamen . At this point Zula takes over as DT story 's focus . She 's press - ganged into a pack of captive hackers and soldiers of fortune who pursue first DT NN writers and then , as DT narrative upshifts , a bin Ladenesque Islamic terrorist . ( DT NN of focus is a bit jarring . But PRP 's a long story  Reamde clocks in at over 1,000 pages . ) DT pace of Reamde is rapid and unwavering  DT plot automatically extrudes twists , JJ settings and even fresh major characters at precisely calibrated intervals . DT characters ping - pong around DT globe as if geography were an afterthought and communicate via a pidgin English largely based on video games , which is their shared frame of reference . These are NNS who , in any earlier incarnation of human civilization , MD never have met CD another . But now PRP have , and not because PRP wished to , but because DT logic of money and information requires PRP , and because DT now flat , frictionless NN no longer has DT power to keep them apart . But DT story of Reamde is mostly RB as a superstructure for Stephenson 's observations about how DT NN around PRP actually works  DT background is DT foreground . EX 's a marvelous sequence late in DT book when DT characters become transfixed by what 's happening on a computer , and Stephenson , without pausing or even slowing down DT action , weaves in a concise explanation of how a computer monitor works and why PRP looks DT way PRP does . PRP do n't bog down in PRP  DT explanation is DT action and DT moment feels real , because PRP understand not just what 's happening but RB why and how , down to DT submolecular level . This realness serves Stephenson 's themes well : he likes to play with DT sharp sheer between DT NN as PRP is and how PRP appears in DT cartoon looking glass of pop culture . Asked why DT Russian criminals VBP he and Zula can find DT author of Reamde , a no-nonsense Hungarian programmer replies , "" Because PRP are hackers , and PRP have seen movies . "" DT joke of watching a bunch of video - game addicts VBP caught up in actual shootouts never gets old : right in DT middle of a finely turned Mexican standoff on a dock in Xiamen , DT terrorist delivers a lecture on DT eccentricities of DT firing mechanism of DT Makarov pistol WDT his opponent is holding against his head . In Stephenson 's NN , victory generally goes to DT guy who 's read DT manual . If EX is an overarching theme to Reamde , PRP 's DT importance of drilling down through easy bull ---- explanations to DT tough , complicated substrate of DT real NN beneath  DT importance of not satisfying yourself with DT vague approximations of video games and , for DT matter , sub -Stephensonian writers . Toward DT end of DT book , Richard , DT archillusionist of T'Rain , finds himself on DT run and in desperate nonvirtual danger , but instead of despairing he finds his situation perversely exhilarating : "" No NN MD reach him via phone or e-mail , Twitter or Facebook , and bother him . His whole mind , his whole attention was focused on CD thing for DT first NN WDT he MD remember . "" PRP 's worthy of note IN Stephenson  an early prophet of virtual reality , whose novel Snow Crash materially influenced DT development of DT Internet itself  is less interested in DT consensual hallucinations of cyberspace than he is in DT stuff PRP use PRP to escape from . DT Internet is all well and good , but reality is still DT ultimate hack . See NNP 's video about DT scientific mind behind Flash Forward . Read about DT Top 10 Everything of 2008 ."

Term structure of interest rates , commonly known as DT yield curve , depicts DT interest rates of similar quality bonds at different maturities . Essentially , term structure of interest rates is DT relationship between interest rates or bond yields and different terms or maturities . When graphed , DT term structure of interest rates is known as a yield curve , and PRP plays a crucial role in identifying DT current NN of an economy . DT term structure of interest rates reflects expectations of market participants about future changes in interest rates and their assessment of monetary policy conditions . In general terms , yields increase in line with maturity , giving rise to an upward - sloping , or normal , yield curve . DT yield curve is primarily used to illustrate DT term structure of interest rates for standard U.S. NN - issued securities . This is important as PRP is a gauge of DT debt market 's feeling about risk . DT most frequently reported yield curve compares DT three - month , two - NN , five - NN , 10 - NN , and 30 - NN U.S. Treasury debt . ( Yield curve rates are usually available at DT Treasury 's interest rate web sites by 6:00 p.m. ET each trading day ) , DT term of DT structure of interest rates has three primary shapes . • Upward sloping — long term yields are higher than short term yields . This is considered to be DT "" normal "" slope of DT yield curve and signals IN DT economy is in an expansionary mode . • Downward sloping — short term yields are higher than long term yields . Dubbed as an "" inverted "" yield curve and signifies IN DT economy is in , or about to enter , a recessive period . • Flat — very little variation between short and long term yields . Signals WDT DT market is unsure about DT future direction of DT economy . This yield curve is considered DT benchmark for DT credit market , as PRP reports DT yields of risk - free fixed income investments across a range of maturities . In DT credit market , banks and lenders use this benchmark as a gauge for determining lending and savings rates . Yields along DT U.S. Treasury yield curve are primarily influenced by DT Federal Reserve ’s federal funds rate . Other yield curves can RB be developed based upon a comparison of credit investments with similar risk characteristics . Most often , DT Treasury yield curve is upward - sloping . CD basic explanation for this phenomenon is IN investors demand higher interest rates for longer - term investments as compensation for investing their money in longer - duration investments . Occasionally , long - term yields MD fall below short - term yields , creating an inverted yield curve WDT is generally regarded as a harbinger of recession . DT Outlook for DT Overall Credit Market DT term structure of interest rates and DT direction of DT yield curve can be used to judge DT overall credit market environment . A flattening of DT yield curve means longer - term rates are falling in comparison to short - term rates , which MD have implications for a recession . When short - term rates begin to exceed long - term rates , DT yield curve is inverted , and a recession is likely occurring or approaching . When longer - term rates fall below shorter - term rates , DT outlook for credit over DT long term is weak . This is often consistent with a weak or recessionary economy , which is defined by two consecutive periods of negative growth in DT gross domestic product ( GDP ) . While other factors , including foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries , can RB result in an inverted yield curve , historically , an inverted yield curve has been an indicator of an impending recession in DT NNP NNPS ."

A Ph.D. Student has presented a thesis claiming DT NNP is FLAT , stationary , DT center of DT universe and only around 13,500 NNS old . Yup , PRP read right . DT thesis was submitted to two assessors , thus passing DT first stage of approvals . DT idea IN DT NNP is ‘ Flat ’ is , in fact , a relatively JJ theory . In fact , before anyone came up with DT idea PRP live on a flat plane , NNS knew very well DT NNP was round . Even though EX are countless images of our NN , and numerous videos which have been recorded from space , EX are still some who argue DT NNP is in fact flat . CD of them is a Ph.D. student who rocked DT Arab scientific community when she presented her thesis claiming DT NNP is FLAT , stationary , DT center of DT universe and only around 13,500 NNS old . Yup , PRP read right . Not only did he suggest PRP live on a flat NNP , he RB rejected scientific theories presented by Newton and Einstein , astronomical discoveries made by Copernicus and Kepler , DT Big Bang theory , atmospheric and geological activity , most of modern climatology , and basically all other scientific teachings made in DT past . According to an article written by DT Gulf NNP , DT student presented her thesis after a staggering five NNS of work . Eventually , PRP was submitted to two assessors , thus passing DT first stage of approvals . DT reports were expected soon , for DT thesis defense to be scheduled . This ‘ shocking ’ doctoral thesis suggests IN DT NN PRP live on is flat , very young and IN PRP remains stationary at DT MIDDLE of DT universe . Furthermore — if DT was n’t enough — DT thesis claims IN DT Sun has an average diameter of 1,135 kilometers and NOT 1.4 million km . DT moon has a width of 908 km , and are located 687 and 23 times closer to NNP respectively . In addition , DT thesis claims EX are 11 planets and STARS in DT sky are LIMITED in number and have a diameter of 292 kilometers and not millions of kilometers . In DT meantime , DT NNP of DT Tunisian Astronomical Association somehow managed to VB his hands on a leaked copy of DT thesis , proving PRP was not a hoax and posted in on Facebook . As noted by Gulf NNP , JJ NNS consider these claims ridiculous , and scandalous since DT thesis firmly rejects ALL modern NN . Others , however , have found PRP extremely disturbing since DT thesis was written by a Ph.D. NN student , and DT professor is DT ‘ highest ’ in academia . Furthermore , Gulf NNP adds : “ Indeed , PRP find in DT conclusions of DT thesis clear indications of this stand and approach , expressions such as : “ using physical and religious arguments ” , “ RB proving DT NN scale of [ Noah ’s ] flood ” , “ proposed a JJ kinematic approach WDT conforms to DT verses of DT Quran ” , “ DT roles of DT stars are : ( 1 ) to be ornaments of DT sky ; ( 2 ) to stone DT devils ; and ( 3 ) as signs to guide creatures in DT darkness of NN ” ; and finally “ DT geo- centric model … accords with DT verses of DT Quran and DT pronouncements of our Prophet . ”"

Larry Edwards is standing in a subterranean chamber , his headlamp illuminating a series of mineral formations . From DT cathedral - IN ceiling dangle tubes known as soda straws . Along a waist - high ledge squats a trio of stout stalagmites , their surfaces slick with ecru-colored ooze . “ Now DT ’s DT kind of thing PRP might be interested in , ” Edwards says , bending to peer at CD . I hear DT plink , plink , plink of falling droplets . PRP hits DT top of a stalagmite , then spreads out , laying down a thin film of DT mineral calcium carbonate , or calcite , from rainwater seeping though limestone . Drop by drop DT stalagmite has grown to its present height — about 18 inches — over who knows how JJ centuries . Edwards , a geochemist at DT University of Minnesota and a pioneer in DT use of cave formations to document ancient NN , is not planning to collect stalagmites today . But two specimens severed from their moorings when DT owner of DT cave complex , Spring Valley Caverns , opened a deeper passageway recently provided Edwards and his colleagues with a record of extreme rainfall events over DT past 3,000 NNS . Edwards wonders if some of Spring Valley ’s stalagmites MD contain older records still , dating back to when giant glaciers covered much of DT Northern Hemisphere or even to CD of DT distant warm periods , or interglacials , WDT punctuated DT NN age NN . A short NN later , PRP retrace our steps , navigating DT sequence of walkways and ladders WDT leads to DT cave ’s entrance . As PRP step into DT light , Edwards turns to me . “ Do PRP notice all DT sounds , all DT smells ? ” he says . “ When PRP come up , PRP seem so pronounced . ” Edwards , renowned among paleoclimatologists for his cave findings , is n’t much of a spelunker . “ PRP ’s not IN I ’m claustrophobic , ” he says with a shrug , “ I just VBP PRP better up here . ” To Edwards , a stalagmite is more than a chunk of geology WDT looks IN a modern sculpture : PRP ’s a collection of NN sensors , rather IN tree rings but extending often hundreds of thousands of NNS back in NN . Perhaps DT only other earthly archives WDT have provided such a high - resolution portrait of DT past half - million NNS are NN cores . But unlike NN , caves can be found all over DT NN . “ I MD VB so far as to say IN these are among DT most important paleoclimate records PRP have , ” David Battisti , a University of Washington atmospheric scientist , says of DT cave data . From Edwards ’ lab is emerging a high - resolution picture of precipitation patterns long ago . Just as important , his work is providing DT scientific community with an increasingly precise NN scale , CD WDT is bringing other records into alignment . Edwards and his colleagues have used cave formations to tighten up DT timing for ancient rises in carbon dioxide locked into Antarctica ’s NN . PRP ’ve even used them to date skeletal remains WDT trace human migration routes . Why should PRP care about what happened so long ago ? A reason can be found in DT mounting nervousness over DT consequences of JJ NN . With heat - trapping carbon dioxide in DT atmosphere already reaching levels not seen for at least 800,000 NNS , NNS IN Edwards worry IN weather patterns MD undergo sudden , destabilizing changes . NN cores from Greenland , for instance , reveal a sequence of abrupt temperature oscillations over DT past 140,000 NNS , with severe cold snaps leavened by a series of sudden , if ephemeral , warmings . Eerily similar oscillations are now showing up in DT precipitation records from caves . In a landmark NN , Edwards and his collaborators compared DT precipitation swings captured by Hulu Cave on DT outskirts of Nanjing , NNP , with temperatures encoded by Greenland ’s NN . Plotted as graphs , and positioned side by side , DT dips and valleys in both records are sharp and — for DT 60,000 - NN period covered by DT stalagmites — synchronous ."

DT NNP space agency 's Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO ) recently spotted DT largest flare to come from DT Sun since October 2017 . A solar flare is a flash of radiation from sunspots , cooler patches on DT Sun 's surface . Nasa has RB observed more of these sunspots and thinks DT giant star MD be about to enter a JJ cycle . DT Sun actually has an 11 NN cycle and increased activity hints PRP MD be moving towards a more active stage . However , DT strong solar flare spotted recently posed no threat to NNP and was n't heading in our direction . Nasa VBD DT flare was RB not strong enough to alert NNS at DT Space Weather Prediction Center . PRP 've had a few months of very little solar activity so astronomers have been keeping their eye on DT Sun to see what happens next . Nasa says PRP wo n't VB whether DT JJ sunspots indicate increased activity for a JJ more months . DT space agency VBD : "" PRP takes at least six months of solar observations and sunspot - counting after a minimum to VB when PRP 's occurred . "" Because DT minimum is defined by DT lowest number of sunspots in a cycle , NNS need to see DT numbers consistently rising before PRP can determine when exactly PRP were at DT bottom . "" PRP can take 12 months to confirm minimum solar activity , by which point DT Sun should be out of DT part of DT cycle . DT Sun's 11 NN cycle sees activity and sunspots rise and fall in number . DT latest solar flares , detected on NNP 29 , were categorised as as M - class solar flares . This means PRP came from JJ sunspots . DT M RB stands for ' medium ' as all solar flares are classified into A , B , C , M or X categories , depending on how powerful PRP are . If an M - class solar flare was to impact NNP PRP MD cause blackouts across DT polar regions and small radiation storms . In other space NN , DT highest - ever resolution photos of DT Sun were published online earlier this NN . A SpaceX rocket launched two NNP astronauts into orbit over DT weekend .

At first glance , DT flick seems to be CD of those generic , God-awful teen movies . However , a closer look reveals how its overall tone and message are in sharp contrast to stereotypes of DT genre . “ Josie and DT Pussycats ” is indeed an acerbic critique of a morally bankrupt music industry . DT most surprising thing about this 2001 movie is its frighteningly accurate predictions regarding today ’s pop music and its Illuminati agenda : mind controlled artists , hypnotized masses , subliminal messages … PRP ’s all RB . This article will examine DT movie ’s themes and their relation to today ’s music business context . Josie and DT Pussycats was released in 2001 by Universal . In music industry terms , 2001 is ancient history . Just to put PRP back in DT context of DT era : N’Sync were still singing Bye Bye Bye , Cisco wanted to see your thong and everybody was wondering Who Let DT Dogs Out . Teens were VBG crazy for boy bands IN DT Backstreet Boys and everybody was dancing to Ja Rule . So , yes , PRP was a long NN ago . Josie and DT Pussycats came out during DT period , but PRP seems to foretell DT death of DT era . DT movie starts with members of DT boy band “ Du Jour , ” a spoof on DT Backstreet Boys , dying in a forced plane crash . DT group is then replaced by a girl band with a semi- punky attitude and non-threatening pop rock music . This pretty much reflects what actually happened in DT NNS following DT release of this movie : N’Sync and DT Backstreet Boys disappeared from DT preteen music market and were replaced by Miley Cyrus , Hilary Duff , DT Jonas Brothers , and so on . Despite DT movie ’s apparent lightheartedness , PRP displays a harsh and sustained judgment of DT music business . PRP is RB severely critical of DT NN of America ’s youth . Teens and preteens are constantly depicted as a herd of brainless drones who are incapable of independent thinking and prone to hysteria . But behind DT usual “ OMG these big corporations are so corporation - y ” criticism , Josie and DT Pussycats tackles , in an odd and humorous way , some of DT darker sides of DT music industry . These include DT mind control of DT masses and entertainers and even DT assassination of artists who rebel or ask too JJ questions . DT Boy Band WDT Knew Too Much As stated above , DT movie starts with Du Jour ( DT boy band “ of DT day ” ) enjoying their enormous success . In their private jet , DT vain and half - witted group of singers complain about petty things to their record executive Wyatt , who acts more IN a legal guardian . Or , in mind control terms , a handler . DT band then asks Wyatt about strange sounds PRP heard in DT acapella tracks of their latest song … and PRP VBP some answers . Wyatt ’s answer is quite extreme : He straps on a parachute and jumps off DT plane , leaving Du Jour to die in what NN will refer to an “ accidental ” plane crash . This has actually happened in reality numerous times . Artists who start uncovering DT darker side of DT entertainment business , who ask too JJ questions , or worse , who plan to reveal these things to DT NN , are often dropped , publicly humiliated and scorned . And , as in Du Jour ’s case , PRP are RB sometimes killed for displaying such behavior . Du Jour was signed with DT NN ’s biggest record label , Mega Records . PRP soon learn IN DT company is much more than a record label . Mega Records is , in fact , “ in business ” with DT American NN and DT FBI to brainwash DT “ most influential demographic in DT entire population ” : DT youth . While giving a tour of DT label ’s headquarters to visitors from foreign NNS ( who are RB to learn how PRP ’s done ) , Fiona , DT eccentric CEO of Mega Records , has this to say : Fiona ’s office then turns into an elevator and starts descending into a secret underground facility . DT label ’s headquarters is , in fact , a control center for manipulating DT minds of DT American youth . PRP creates JJ fads , decides everything from “ what clothes are in style to what slang is in vogue , ” with DT ultimate goal of making DT youth continually spend money on CD temporary trend after another . Reality is , of course , more complex than DT . Trends are ( probably ) not created in an underground control center in NNP York City . EX is , however , truth in this near - cartoonish depiction of DT music business . DT entertainment industry is indeed connected to “ higher powers ” ( as personified in DT movie by DT FBI agent ) in order to sell DT youth on DT JJ elite ’s agenda . Popular culture not only attempts to sell products and brands to DT audience but RB ideas , values , and attitudes . In previous articles on DT Vigilant Citizen , PRP have established IN today ’s agenda focuses on concepts such as transhumanism , Illuminati symbolism , premature sexualization , police NN / militarization , and so forth . Fiona then explains IN her label inserts subliminal messages in pop music in order to manipulate DT youth into buying products and ideas . DT label thus goes beyond DT simple advertising of products . PRP conceals hidden messages in DT music WDT bypass DT audience ’s conscious minds in order to directly reach their subconscious . After DT presentation , a foreigner asks Fiona “ How can PRP control DT rock bands ? What if CD of them discovers PRP are placing hidden messages in their music ? ” This is what she answers : EX are numerous real - life examples of celebrities who have been silenced , CD of DT most shocking and evident being Michael Jackson . After decades of being controlled by DT entertainment business , he attempted to break free in DT late 90s . He even spoke out about PRP . He then endured NNS of scandals , trials , JJ ridicule and financial difficulties . Michael Jackson still managed to keep singing and dancing , even organizing a NN tour for 2010 . Since previous attempts to destroy him failed , MJ got silenced … by force . So , PRP MD seem IN ten NNS after DT release of this movie , shady celebrity sacrifices are still happening . In an attempt to “ take things to DT next level , ” Mega Records develops a JJ technology called “ 3DX Surround Sound . ” This JJ technology “ makes DT music feel IN PRP is happening all around PRP . ” All DT kids who attend Josie and DT Pussycat concerts or watch them on TV have to purchase this headgear in order to hear DT music . Back in real life , PRP are seeing DT commercialization of a very similar technology … Josie and DT Pussycats : From Nobodies to Sex Kittens Programming Stars After DT killing of Du Jour , record exec Wyatt is instructed to find a JJ band as soon as possible . DT movie makes PRP clear IN talent is absolutely irrelevant . DT label just needs a good - looking group and PRP will take care of DT rest . Then PRP are introduced to DT Pussycats … and their lack of fans . DT rock band comprises three young ladies who wear leopard ears as a prop . PRP is quite obvious IN nobody wants to hear their music and even their manager Alexander does n’t seem to VB PRP . After hearing about Du Jour ’s plane crash on television , DT Pussycats leader , Josie , is motivated to “ VB out RB ” and obtain a record contract . At DT same NN , Wyatt is driving around in DT small town of Riverdale , looking for a band to sign . Then PRP happens . Wyatt sits down with DT girls and tells them how happy he is “ to be sitting down with DT Pussyhats . ” He obviously knows nothing about DT band and does not care . He then offers them a record contract with Mega Records . Josie wonders briefly why her band is being offered a contract by a label WDT did not even hear them play . However , her hunger for fame dispels all her doubts and DT band signs DT contract . DT Pussycats ’ story is classic : A broke , struggling band attempts to become big by performing gigs ; a record label offers a shady contract ; DT desperate and fame - hungry band signs , not knowing what PRP are getting into . For DT band , PRP ’s either taking a chance and signing DT contract or VBG back to eating Ramen noodles in a crappy apartment . So , PRP sign DT contract . Right after PRP sign , DT label subjects DT group to a complete metamorphosis : a make - over to “ sexy them up , ” and a name NN , from DT Pussycats to Josie and DT Pussycats . DT group is now completely owned by DT label . PRP has lost control of its image , its name , and even its music , as PRP has been modified to contain subliminal messages . But those changes pay off , as PRP become a # 1 band in less than a week . DT movie RB contains numerous references to mind control programming . As stated in previous articles , numerous celebrities have been subjected to mind control in order for them to become more easily manageable by their handlers . In bolder words , PRP become slaves of DT industry . Monarch mind control includes numerous types of programming , CD of them being Beta ( or Sex Kitten programming ) . PRP is DT type of programming WDT is DT most used in DT entertainment industry and PRP is coded with references to “ cats , ” “ kitties , ” “ pussycats , ” and RB with DT wearing of feline print clothing . This might explain why DT producers chose to base DT girl band on DT Archie Comic of DT same name . DT symbolism was just too perfect . So , in less than a week , with DT help of subliminal messaging , DT group produces a # 1 hit and sells out a huge concert . DT group even earns DT honor of meeting DT label ’s CEO , Fiona . DT girls soon realize IN Fiona acts in a strange , dissociative matter as if she were herself under some sort of mind control . After DT meeting , Fiona spies on DT group using hidden cameras and learns IN two members of DT group , Melody , and Valerie , are creeped out by her and flat - out do not trust her . So she decides to VB with another tactic PRP often see in DT music business : to keep DT star of DT group and drop DT other band members . In order to carry out this operation , DT label proceeds to use mind control on Josie by making her listen to subliminal messages in her own music . DT process completely changes her attitude and personality : Josie turns from a sweet and down - to - NN girl into an attention - hungry diva who is convinced IN her friends are worthless . This scene subtly describes DT hidden , mind control aspect WDT happens in DT music business : label execs use mind control programming to create an alter persona in Josie , which PRP can control and manage at will . Fortunately , Josie manages to snap out of her hypnotic NN and learns everything about DT 3D , mass mind control concert . Unfortunately , her bandmates Melody and Valerie have been kidnapped by DT label and Josie must perform in DT mind control concert to avoid DT “ accidental killing ” of her friends . I will spare PRP DT details of DT ending , but I can tell PRP IN PRP involves catfights and DT girls playing generic pop rock in front of a crowd WDT has learned to VB for itself . Thank PRP , Josie ! DT least PRP can say is IN Josie and DT Pussycats is an odd movie . PRP strongly criticizes some aspects of DT entertainment business while perpetuating more of DT same . CD example of this paradoxical situation is DT ridiculous amount of product placements in DT movie . Some of those placements are pretty hilarious ( see DT box of Tide above ) , but in DT end , PRP too perpetuate DT market ideology . Imagine me repeatedly punching someone in DT face . Then when asked to stop , imagine me replying : “ Ca n’t PRP see IN I ’m pushing this face punching to an absurd level ? PRP ’re obviously not getting DT brilliant second - degree message here , I ’m actually denouncing violence ! So sit RB and VB about violence in society while I keep pounding this guy ’s face . ” Despite what is being VBN , DT fact remains IN pounding someone in DT face is itself perpetuating violence … and this movie keeps punching DT viewers in DT face with product placements . In fact , DT entire movie ’s message gives DT same odd feeling . Its clever “ behind - DT - scenes ” look at DT music industry makes DT viewers feel PRP ’re “ in on DT joke , ” making them comfortable enough to let their guard down . However , at DT end of DT day , DT young viewers are still DT butt of DT joke : all of DT sleazy and gimmicky tactics are being used on real - life viewers in order to sell them mind controlling music . Furthermore , DT movie fictionalizes some of DT darker aspects of DT entertainment business , for example by making mind controlled artists something WDT PRP can “ only see in DT movies . ” At DT end of DT film , Mega Records ’ mass hypnosis plans are uncovered , and DT FBI ( who funded DT project ) immediately attempts to dissociate from DT label , even arresting Fiona “ on charges of NN against DT youth of America . ” DT agent then privately says to Fiona : “ PRP were shutting down your entire project anyways … PRP found out IN subliminal messages work much better in movies ! ” This is DT movie ’s way of saying IN even though PRP has let PRP in on DT joke , DT movie is still part of DT plans . In other words , DT biggest joke in DT movie… is PRP ."

The_DT Italian_JJ Renaissance_NNP was_VBD over_RB ._.","Toward DT end of DT 14th century A.D. , a handful of Italian thinkers declared IN PRP were living in a JJ age . DT barbarous , unenlightened “ Middle Ages ” were over , PRP VBD ; DT JJ age MD be a “ rinascità ” ( “ rebirth ” ) of learning and literature , art and culture . This was DT birth of DT period now known as DT Renaissance . For centuries , scholars have agreed IN DT Italian Renaissance ( another word for “ rebirth ” ) happened just DT way : IN between DT 14th century and DT 17th century , a JJ , modern way of thinking about DT NN and man ’s place in PRP replaced an old , backward NN . In fact , DT Renaissance ( in Italy and in other parts of Europe ) was considerably more complicated than DT : For CD thing , in JJ ways DT period PRP call DT Renaissance was not so different from DT era WDT preceded PRP . However , JJ of DT scientific , artistic and cultural achievements of DT so - called Renaissance do share common themes , most notably DT humanistic belief IN man was DT center of his own universe . Fifteenth - century Italy was unlike any other place in Europe . PRP was divided into independent city - NNS , each with a different form of NN . Florence , where DT Italian Renaissance began , was an independent republic . PRP was RB a banking and commercial capital and , after London and Constantinople , DT third - largest city in Europe . Wealthy Florentines flaunted their money and power by becoming patrons , or supporters , of artists and intellectuals . In this way , DT city became DT cultural center of Europe and of DT Renaissance . DT NNP Humanism : Cornerstone of DT Renaissance Thanks to DT patronage of these wealthy elites , Renaissance - era writers and thinkers were able to spend their days doing just DT . Instead of devoting themselves to ordinary jobs or to DT asceticism of DT monastery , PRP MD enjoy worldly pleasures . PRP traveled around Italy , studying ancient ruins and rediscovering Greek and Roman texts . To Renaissance scholars and philosophers , these classical sources from Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome held great wisdom . Their secularism , their appreciation of physical beauty and especially their emphasis on man ’s achievements and expression formed DT governing intellectual principle of DT Italian Renaissance . This philosophy is known as “ humanism . ” Humanism encouraged NNS to be curious and to question received wisdom ( particularly DT of DT medieval Church ) . PRP RB encouraged NNS to use experimentation and observation to solve earthly problems . As a result , JJ Renaissance intellectuals focused on trying to define and understand DT laws of nature and DT physical NN . For example , Renaissance artist Leonardo Da Vinci created detailed scientific “ studies ” of objects ranging from flying machines to submarines . He RB created pioneering studies of human anatomy . Likewise , DT scientist and mathematician Galileo Galilei investigated CD natural law after another . By dropping different - sized cannonballs from DT top of a building , for instance , he proved IN all objects fall at DT same rate of acceleration . He RB built a powerful telescope and used PRP to show IN DT NNP and other planets revolved around DT sun and not , as religious authorities argued , DT other way around . ( For this , Galileo was arrested for heresy and threatened with torture and death , but he refused to recant : “ I do not believe IN DT same God who has endowed PRP with senses , reason and intellect has intended PRP to forgo their use , ” he VBD . ) However , perhaps DT most important technological development of DT Renaissance happened not in Italy but in Germany , where Johannes Gutenberg invented DT mechanical movable - type printing press in DT middle of DT 15th century . For DT first NN , PRP was possible to make books–and , by extension , knowledge–widely available . Michelangelo ’s “ David . ” Leonardo da Vinci ’s “ DT Last Supper . ” Sandro Boticelli’s “ DT Birth of Venus . ” During DT Italian Renaissance , art was everywhere ( just look up at Michelangelo ’s “ DT Last Judgment ” painted on DT ceiling of DT Sistine Chapel ! ) . Patrons such as Florence ’s Medici family sponsored projects large and small , and successful artists became celebrities in their own right . Renaissance artists and architects applied JJ humanist principles to their work . For example , DT architect Filippo Brunelleschi applied DT elements of classical Roman architecture–shapes , columns and especially proportion –to his own buildings . DT magnificent eight - sided dome he built at DT Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral in Florence was an engineering triumph–it was 144 feet across , weighed 37,000 tons and had no buttresses to hold PRP up–as well as an aesthetic NN . Brunelleschi RB devised a way to draw and paint using linear perspective . DT is , he figured out how to paint from DT perspective of DT person looking at DT painting , so IN space MD appear to recede into DT frame . After DT architect Leon Battista Alberti explained DT principles behind linear perspective in his treatise “ Della Pittura ” ( “ On Painting ” ) , PRP became CD of DT most noteworthy elements of almost all Renaissance painting . Later , JJ painters began to use a technique called chiaroscuro to create an illusion of three - dimensional space on a flat canvas . Fra Angelico , DT painter of frescoes in DT church and friary of San Marco in Florence , was called “ a rare and perfect talent ” by DT Italian painter and architect Vasari in his “ Lives of DT Artists . ” Renaissance painters IN Raphael , Titian and Giotto and Renaissance sculptors IN Donatello and Lorenzo Ghiberti created art WDT MD inspire generations of future artists . DT End of DT Italian Renaissance By DT end of DT 15th century , Italy was being torn apart by CD war after another . DT kings of England , France and Spain , along with DT Pope and DT Holy Roman Emperor , battled for control of DT wealthy peninsula . At DT same NN , DT Catholic Church , which was itself wracked with scandal and corruption , had begun a violent crackdown on dissenters . In 1545 , DT Council of Trent officially established DT Roman Inquisition . In this NN , humanism was akin to heresy . DT Italian Renaissance was over ."

MRI scans of 10 NNS with known cortical atrophy caused by hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy sustained during term delivery were selected alongside 8 age - matched controls who had normal MRI findings . DT research was approved by DT University of Bristol Ethics Committee ( case reference 27741 ) and has been performed in accordance with DT ethics standards laid down in DT 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments . PRP selected data from T1 - weighted 3 - D turbo spin-echo or 3 - D fluid - attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) imaging . Using DT 3 - D curved MPR function in OsiriX , multiple curved reformatting techniques were tested , then formalised and standardised . PRP performed reconstructions from all three planes ( coronal , sagittal and axial ) using different landmark slices ( e.g. , foramen of Monro , pineal gland ) , angles of reconstruction ( e.g. , following DT course of DT Sylvian fissure , central sulcus ) and at various depths to DT cortical surface . Two images ( CD reconstructed from DT coronal plane and CD from DT sagittal plane ) were determined to give DT best overview of DT cortical regions most frequently damaged in hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy sustained at term delivery ( i.e. DT watershed zones , and perisylvian and perirolandic regions ) . PRP describe an optimal method for creating these reconstructions . For reconstructions from DT coronal 3 - D T1 - weighted data set , DT slice demonstrating DT foramina of Monro is selected for generating DT flat - NN map . DT pathway for generating DT curved reconstructions is plotted 1 - cm deep to DT surface of DT brain by depositing cursors at 12 landmarks ( 6 on either side of DT midline ) as described in Fig. 1 . DT resultant image has been likened to a Mercator map of DT NN [ 3 , 4 ] . For reconstructions from DT sagittal 3 - D T1 - weighted data , DT landmark midline slice demonstrating DT aqueduct of Sylvius is selected . DT pathway for generating DT curved reconstructions is plotted 1 - cm deep to DT cortical surface by depositing cursors at 8 points starting anteriorly and ending posteriorly as described in Fig. 1 . DT resultant image derived from sagittal images is likened to unrolling a scroll . DT cerebral sulcal anatomy of NNS in DT control group from DT Mercator brain maps was identified using work by Wagner et al . [ 4 ] . No equivalent anatomical work exists for scroll brain maps , and DT sulcal anatomy was identified de novo from an online anatomy atlas [ 5 ] . DT sulcal anatomy and expected regions of abnormality were then plotted on DT Mercator and scroll maps in CD of DT control patients as a reference source ( Fig. 2 ) . Flat - NN maps ( Mercator and scroll projections ) of DT brain were then generated for 10 NNS with previous hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy . These were displayed alongside those of age - matched healthy controls for comparison . Two readers ( S.A. , a paediatric radiologist with 15 NNS ’ experience in neuroimaging , and E.S. , a 5th - NN radiology trainee ) assessed each flat - NN map for DT presence of ( 1 ) widening of DT Sylvian fissure ; ( 2 ) widening of DT longitudinal fissure , noting whether such widening was localised ( indicating regional watershed - zone , or perisylvian or perirolandic volume loss ) or generalised ; ( 3 ) cortical atrophy in characteristic locations ( perirolandic , perisylvian or watershed distribution ) , and ( 4 ) ulegyria . Discrepancies were arbitrated by a third reader ( A.C. , a qualified general radiologist 3 NNS post completion of training ) . No abnormal features were identified on any of DT eight controls ( mean age 3 NNS 11 months ; 5 boys , 3 girls ) . DT abnormal findings WDT were visible in NNS with hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy sustained at term delivery ( mean age 3 NNS 6 months ; 6 boys , 4 girls ) are shown in Table 1 . DT flat - NN map generated by DT curved reconstruction displays DT structures along a region adjacent to DT plotted path at DT expense of structures at DT extremes of DT axis perpendicular to DT path ; two maps are generated from perpendicular curved lines , so different structures are seen optimally on each map . DT following general observations were made : • DT perisylvian and perirolandic regions were better demonstrated on DT Mercator maps . DT scroll maps demonstrated DT lateral structures poorly . • More of DT frontal lobe anatomy was seen consistently on DT Mercator maps . • DT central posterior parietal and occipital lobes were better demonstrated on DT scroll maps . • Watershed zones were well demonstrated on both Mercator and scroll maps . DT following observations were made from review of flat - NN maps in NNS who sustained hypoxic–ischaemic injury at term delivery : • Widening of DT longitudinal fissure was seen on all abnormal NNS on Mercator and scroll maps , consistent with parasagittal / parafalcine watershed atrophy . In 9 of 10 instances EX was a localised biconvex separation of DT hemispheres distinct from DT parallel separation of DT hemispheres elsewhere ( Figs. 3 and 4 ) . • Damage to intervascular watershed zones was well seen on both Mercator and scroll maps ( anterior watershed zones were better demonstrated on Mercator map and posterior watershed regions on DT scroll maps ) and was noted in a continuous band - IN fashion ( as opposed to a wedge of abnormality ) ( Fig. 4 ) . • Perirolandic and perisylvian damage was better demonstrated on Mercator maps ( Figs. 3 and 4 ) . • Ulegyria was identified in 7 of 10 of NNS of hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy ( Figs. 3 and 4 , Table 1 ) ."

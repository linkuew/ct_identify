The tax is designed to reduce the output of NN gases and NN dioxide , a colorless and odorless incombustible gas , into the atmosphere . The tax is imposed with the goal of JJ protection . A tax designed to mitigate or remove the negative externalities of NN emission , a NN tax is a type of Pigovian tax . NN is VBN in every kind of hydrocarbon fuel ( including coal , petroleum , and natural gas ) and is released as the harmful toxin NN dioxide ( CO ) when this kind of fuel is burned . CO is the compound primarily responsible for the "" NN "" effect of trapping heat within the NNP 's atmosphere , and is , therefore , CD of the primary causes of JJ NN . A NN tax is RB referred to as a form of NN pricing on NN gas NNS where a fixed NN is set by the NN for NN NNS in certain sectors . The NN is passed through from businesses to consumers . By increasing the cost of NN NNS , governments hope to curb consumption , reduce the demand for fossil fuels , and push more NNS toward creating environmentally - friendly substitutes . A NN tax is a NN for a NN to exert some NN over NN NNS without resorting to the levers of a command economy , by which the NN MD VB the means of production and manually halt NN NNS . Any NN VBN in manufactured NNS IN plastics that is not burned is not taxed . The same applies to any CO that is permanently isolated from production and is not released into the atmosphere . But the tax is paid during the upstream process , or when the fuel or gas is extracted from the NNP . Producers can then pass on the tax to the NN by as much as they can . This , in turn , gives consumers a chance to reduce their own NN footprints . NN taxes have been implemented in a number of NNS IN the NN . They take several JJ forms , but most amount to a straightforward rate of taxation per ton of hydrocarbon fuel VBN . The JJ country to implement a NN tax was Finland , in 1990 . That levy currently stands at $ 24.39 dollars per ton of NN . The Finns were quickly followed by other Nordic NNS — Sweden and Norway both implemented their own NN taxes in 1991 . Starting at a rate of $ 51 per ton of CO VBN in gasoline ( the tax MD later decrease considerably ) , the Norwegian tax is among the most stringent in the NN . Most forms of NN taxation have been deployed successfully , but Australia 's failed attempt from 2012 - 2014 stands in stark contrast . The minority Green party was able to broker the NN tax during a period of JJ stagnation in 2011 , but the tax never garnered the support of either of the main parties in Australia , the left - leaning Labor Party ( which reluctantly agreed to the tax to form a NN with the Greens ) and the center - JJ Liberals , whose leader Tony Abbott spearheaded the 2014 repeal . IN most JJ initiatives to combat NN NN , NN taxes remain highly controversial ."

It was reported at the NN that Prince Harry gave a barefoot speech at the Google NN retreat but celebs were criticised for VBG gas - guzzling private jets and superyachts to VB there . Harry and Meghan are thought to have planned their bombshell retreat from frontline royal NN at the stunning Mille Fleurs home on Vancouver Island . But the royal couple have been at the heart of a secrecy row over who lent them the luxury mansion . Harry and Meghan refused to VB if they paid for their six - week stay or confirm who the property belongs to . Moscow - born Mr Milner RB rented Mille Fleurs five NNS ago , but denies he now owns the stunning pad . But neighbours claim the holiday home is owned by a Russian billionaire . Mr Milner 's pal Canadian music producer David Foster RB has a home on Vancouver Island . The NNP previously revealed Harry and Meghan asked neighbours to sign non-disclosure agreements before moving in for Christmas with baby Archie . The Mille Fleurs home near Victoria , British Columbia , MD have cost more than £ 100,000 to rent . The idyllic bolthole has stunning views and boasts eight bedrooms and CD private beaches . CD local , who did not wish to be named , VBD The NNP : “ I was very surprised to hear they were staying there because it ’s always been a mystery about who actually owns it . "" It does n’t seem the sort of place a royal couple MD VB . ” The mystery over the property ’s ownership is likely to raise concerns over the couple ’s acquaintances as they seek “ financial independence ” . An estate agent who helped sell it in 2014 VBD the JJ owner included a non-disclosure agreement as part of the deal . He VBD the buyer was neither Canadian nor JJ . The complex purchasing method can VB NNS hide their involvement . All of the 27 properties on the road are registered under a NN called Towner Bay Country Club . It means buyers effectively just purchase shares in the club , with their names not on any JJ paperwork . Mr Milner made a fortune when his investment firm DST NNP bought stakes in NNP and NNP with funding VBN to be from Kremlin - controlled NNS . He has RB invested in a real estate venture co-owned by Donald NNP ’s son- in - law , Jared Kushner . When asked about Mille Fleurs , Mr Milner 's spokesman Paddy Harverson VBD the Mail : "" Neither Yuri Milner nor any family member nor any entity affiliated with him or his family owns this property . "" He rented the property five NNS ago for a brief period of NN . "" Harry and Meghan missed the traditional royal Christmas with the Queen"

Zhengyu Liu , professor of atmospheric and ocean sciences at the NNP of Wisconsin , explains : “ NNS from observation suggests that the NNP is cooling while the physical NNS suggests the complete opposite . ” Liu has been working with professors from JJ other academias to understand the obvious cooling of the NN : The issue has been termed the Holocene NNP Conundrum ( HTC ) which is explained : “ A recent NN reconstruction of JJ annual NN shows Early Holocene warmth followed by a cooling trend through the Middle to Late Holocene [ Marcott SA , FW al. , 2013 , NNP 339( 6124):1198 –1201 ] . “ This JJ cooling is puzzling because it is opposite from the expected and simulated JJ NN trend due to the retreating NN sheets and rising atmospheric NN gases . “ Our critical reexamination of this contradiction between the reconstructed cooling and the simulated NN points to potentially significant biases in both the seasonality of the proxy reconstruction and the NN sensitivity of current NN models . ” “ Over the last 10,000 NNS , Liu VBZ , we VBP atmospheric NN dioxide rose by 20 parts per CD before the 20th century , and the massive NN sheet of the Last Glacial Maximum has been retreating . “ These physical NNS suggest that , globally , the annual mean JJ NN should have continued to warm , RB as regions of the NN experienced cooling , such as during the Little NNP Age in Europe between the 16th and 19th centuries . ” The myth perpetuated by alarmist NNS is that there is a 97 % consensus that man-made NN NN is real and that the NNP is heating up . However , John Cook , NN scientist for the UQ NNP NNP Institute ( GCI ) , released NNS from the NNP of Queensland ( UQ ) that shows “ that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on [ anthropogenic JJ NN ] is a vanishingly JJ proportion of the published research . ” Alastair McEwan , acting pro-vice - chancellor of UQ defended the college ’s claim that there is a scientific consensus , independently of Cook ’s findings : To discredit Cook , a NN was released in 2013 by climatologists that claimed Cook “ misrepresented the views of most consensus NNS . ” This shows that the consensus that NNS are the sole NN of NN NN is actually only 0.3 % .

Tonsils are lumps of tissue on both sides of the back of the throat that VBP the NN NN protect the body from infections . But sometimes infections are too much for the tonsils to handle , and these fighters of infection become infected themselves . Infected tonsils VBP swollen and red , and have a yellow or white coating . A person with tonsillitis MD have a sore throat , fever , swollen glands in the neck , and trouble swallowing . What Are the Signs & NNS of Tonsillitis ? Inflamed tonsils look red and swollen , and MD be covered with a yellow or whitish coating or spots . Someone with tonsillitis MD have : • a sore throat , which can be mild to severe • white spots or pus on the tonsils If you have NNS of tonsillitis , call your NN . Tonsillitis is usually caused by a Bacteria RB can VB it , most commonly group A streptococcus ( strep throat ) . Rarely , tonsillitis can be caused by something other than an infection . Your NN will ask about your NNS and examine your throat and neck . Your NN MD use a soft cotton swab to gently collect a sample from your tonsils and the back of your throat for testing . It 's important for your NN to VB if are causing the infection . If you have strep throat , you 'll VB treatment withto kill the bacteria . This will VB you feel better and prevent other problems that can come from untreated strep throat . If your NN prescribes antibiotics , be sure to follow the directions carefully . Finish taking all the medicine RB if your NNS VBP away and you feel better , or the infection MD come back . If a strep test comes back negative , it 's probably a NN causing the tonsillitis and antibiotics wo n't VB . Just UH with a cold ( RB caused by a NN ) , you 'll have to take it easy for several days and let the NN run its course . Rarely , if someone gets tonsillitis a lot , the NN or an otolaryngologist ( pronounced : oh - FW - lar - un - GA - luh - jist , a NN who specializes in ear , nose , and throat problems ) MD recommend a tonsillectomy ( pronounced : tahn - suh - LEK - tuh - mee ) . This is a surgery to remove the tonsils . Tonsillectomy VBD to be a common procedure , but now experts recommend watching and waiting because JJ tonsils often shrink on their own over NN . How Can I Feel Better ? VB plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids . You can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve any NN or discomfort . ( Do n't take aspirin or other NNS that contain aspirin , though , because these MD put you at NN of developing Reye syndrome , an illness that can have serious complications . ) Avoid smoking or anything that will irritate your throat . It 's best to drink lots of liquids . You MD prefer softer foods , IN applesauce , flavored gelatin , or NN cream . If you do n't feel IN eating , try drinking liquids that contain calories , such as fruit juices , milkshakes , and soups and broths . If you 're on antibiotics , it 's usually OK to return to school 24 hours after you start taking them if your fever is gone and you feel better . If you 're still feeling weak , tired , or achy , it MD be best to stay home for another day or CD . Tonsillitis is contagious . This means you can VB it from someone else who has it . Sneezing and coughing can pass the tonsillitis - causing NN or bacteria from CD person to the next . To protect yourself from catching tonsillitis or to prevent passing it to somebody else : • Wash your hands well and often . • If someone in your household or a friend has tonsillitis , do n't use that person 's cups , glasses , silverware , toothbrush , or other utensils . And if you have tonsillitis , keep your stuff separate and do n't share it with anyone . • Do n't kiss anyone until you 're completely over the tonsillitis . • VB a JJ toothbrush after you feel better and are no longer contagious . When Should I Call the NN ? Call your NN RB away if your condition gets worse ; for example , if you have a hard NN breathing or swallowing . RB talk to your NN if your fever comes back or if you 're not feeling better in a couple of days ."

Cold , dry air is a common asthma trigger and can VB bad flare - ups . That 's especially JJ for NNS who play winter sports and have exercise - induced asthma . Hot , humid air RB can be a problem . In some places , heat and sunlight combine with pollutants to create ground - level ozone . This kind of ozone can be a strong asthma trigger . Wet NN and windy NN can VB problems too . Wet NN encourages mold growth , and wind can blow mold and pollen through the air . If you VBP NN plays a role in your NN 's asthma , keep a diary of asthma NNS and possible triggers and discuss them with your NN . If pollen , mold , or other allergens make asthma NNS worse , ask about allergy testing . How Can We Avoid NN Triggers ? Once you VBP what kind of NN triggers asthma NNS , try these tips to protect your NN : • Watch the forecast for pollen and mold counts plus other conditions ( extreme cold or heat ) that might affect your NN 's asthma . • Make sure your NN wears a scarf over the mouth and nose when outside in very cold NN . • Keep windows closed at night to keep pollen and molds out . If it 's hot , use air conditioning , which cleans , cools , and dries the air . • Keep your NN indoors early in the morning ( before CD a.m. ) when pollen is at its highest . • Your NN should n't mow the lawn or rake leaves , and should be kept away from freshly cut grass and leaf piles . • Dry clothes in the dryer ( hanging clothes or sheets to dry can allow mold or pollen to collect on them ) . • Make sure your NN always has quick - relief medicine ( RB called rescue or fast - acting medicine ) on hand . Your NN 's written asthma NN plan should list NN triggers and ways to manage them , including any seasonal NNS in medicine ."

NN NN , waning habitat will drive NN Researchers are n't clear yet about how the novel NN began infecting NNS , but VBP it seems to have originated in bats , making it the latest in a string of emerging JJ NN that spread from animals . NN and wildlife experts VBP they expect to VB a rise in diseases transmitted among animals , plants and NNS , and in particular , more frequent outbreaks in NNS of diseases that come from animals . Such "" zoonotic "" diseases already make up the majority of JJ infections in NNS . But animals are n't to blame for the increase in JJ outbreaks , according to Arizona NNP NNP virologist Arvind Varsani . NNS are . Varsani researches the emergence of diseases IN the globe and he VBD CD major factors likely to impact the dynamics of NN spread are NN NN and NNS in land use due to urbanization or agriculture . Both factors put animals under strain , forcing them to compete for resources in shrinking habitats and making them opportune hosts for zoonotic diseases , which more easily infect stressed animals . Shrinking suitable habitat amid urbanization and the rapid expansion of agriculture RB cluster animals closer together with NNS and domestic animals . That allows the viruses to jump from CD host to the next . “ You stress these animals and that means you ’re creating an environment for viruses to succeed , where in most NNS the viruses MD ’ve been put to check , "" he VBD . "" And with that , everyone is in very , very close proximity to each other , so what you ’ve got is CD event — and you only VBP CD event to take off — and the next thing you VBP , it 's spilling over . ” And sometimes , the viruses spill over into NNS . According to a CD report from the NNP Nations Environment Programme , RB 60 percent of all infectious diseases in NNS are zoonotic , as well as 75 percent of all emerging infectious diseases . Researchers RB detected an increase in the rate of JJ , emerging infectious diseases , according to the report . In the NN of the novel NN , the source is believed to be a NN in Wuhan , NNP , that sold both dead and live animals . Arizona Game and Fish wildlife veterinarian Anne Justice - Allen VBD that veterinarians and NN experts strongly recommend against having markets IN these , which can be densely packed , difficult to keep clean , and pose a higher NN of viruses jumping from animals into NNS . She VBD the current NN - CD outbreak is an example of how JJ actions to mix together animals that were n't normally together can VB diseases to jump into JJ hosts . "" The more we increase the interaction between NNS and animals , especially wildlife and especially livestock as well , or animals that are raised for food , the more likely we are to VB that kind of situation crop up , "" she VBD . The NNP - CD outbreak is an example of the NN zoonotic diseases pose . Other well - VBN examples of zoonotic diseases that impact NNS are West Nile NN , HIV , Ebola , Zika , bird NN , Middle East respiratory syndrome , or MERS , Rift Valley fever , and sudden acute respiratory syndrome , or NN . On average , CD JJ infectious NN emerges in NNS every four months , according to the UNEP report , but not all are this severe . “ While it is very uncommon for diseases in animals to suddenly jump and become so transmissible between NNS as this NN did , the more we do that sort of thing , mixing animals together ... then the more likely that NN is VBG to be able to jump into NNS and become transmissible between NNS , "" Justice - Allen VBD . With NN NN effects such as drought , increasing NNS and wildfires , Justice - Allen VBD animals will be forced to move to JJ areas . That MD lead to the same type of crowding and mixing seen in live animal markets and possibly expose animals to JJ diseases . FIGHTING NN : VBG robots to speed up testing , ASU hopes to open drive - thru NN testing VBG JJ NNS are increasing the habitat ranges of some insects that transmit diseases from CD organism to another , such as mosquitoes or ticks . NN is RB lengthening the season in which these insects can survive in some areas , leading to a boom in their population . In certain areas , these insects , RB VBN as NN vectors , are now able to survive NN - round where they were n't able to before . The increased range and abundance of vectors MD lead to more widespread NNS of mosquito - and tick - borne diseases such as malaria , West Nile NN , dengue fever , chikungunya , Zika , and Lyme NN , according to Heidi Brown , an ASU researcher who studies vector - borne diseases . Brown is CD of the researchers who works with the Arizona Department of NNP Services on a Building Resilience Against NNP Effects plan , which investigates the impacts of NN NN on JJ NN , projects future scenarios and suggests solutions to mitigate those effects . Arizona is CD of 16 NN grant recipients creating a BRACE plan as part of the CDC's NNP - Ready NNPS and Cities Initiative . "" We have to be prepared for the VBN , which is increases in the stuff that we 're already seeing , but we RB have to be prepared for the unknown , which is novel introductions , "" she VBD . In Arizona , VBN diseases such as West Nile NNP are likely to become a bigger concern , and MD spread into JJ areas of the NN outside of Maricopa County , Brown VBD . "" Flagstaff does n't typically VB about or worry too much about West Nile NNP , and we do n't usually have a lot of NNS up there , but there 's NN that suggests that we might VB to start making sure that we 're watching for it , "" she VBD . Arizona is RB worried about other mosquito - born diseases IN chikungunya and dengue fever , which are n't currently part of Arizona 's ecosystem but MD become permanently established in the future . Factors IN drought can RB VB vectors to cluster IN NN sources alongside of animals , leading to further mixing and further possibilities for JJ diseases spread in vectors . Another bridge between NNS and animal diseases is domestic animals , according to Bernard Bett , a scientist at International Livestock Research Institute . IN the NN , Bett VBD agriculture is increasingly encroaching on wild lands , bringing NNS and domestic animals closer to wild ones and disturbing the natural ecosystem . But domestic animals have been bred in such a NN that they lack the genetic diversity needed for NN resilience and can then pass the infection on to NNS . CD example is the bird NN , which moved from wild birds into domestic poultry before being passed to NNS . Demand for milk and meat "" driven mainly by fast - growing populations of urban consumers in developing NNS , "" is projected to double by 2050 , according to the UNEP report , meaning that the problem is likely to VB worse as agricultural demand expands . Urbanization RB can encroach on wild lands , Varsani VBD , and that means NNS are coming into increased contact with animals — creating another potential avenue for NN transmission . Increased zoonotic NN spread MD RB have devastating effects on animals , especially those already at NN from other NN NN effects . “ We have a number of endangered NNS here in Arizona which are kind of on the edge when it comes to being able to respond to JJ stressors , "" Justice - Allen VBD . CD is the Mount Graham red squirrel , whose habitat was severely damaged by a wildfire in 2017 . While the population seems to be recovering , Justice - Allen VBD , "" another stressor might tip them over the edge . "" Other populations on the brink include the California condor , the black - footed ferret , and Arizona 's indigenous snakes and amphibians such as frogs . Some are already being challenged by NN . Black - footed ferrets feed on prairie dogs , but the plague , spread by fleas , can wipe out entire colonies of prairie dogs , decimating the ferrets ' food supply . This NN is n't native to North NNP , currently has a JJ incident rate in NNS and is curable in most NNS . But NNS of plague MD surge in coming NNS due to NN NN , according to Justice - Allen . "" The dynamics of plague outbreaks is changing , or will VB , "" she VBD . "" This spring is setting us up for a pretty significant plague outbreak . "" Arizona 's frogs and other amphibians are battling a fungal NN called chytridiomycosis , which was RB seen in Africa and interferes with the ability of their NN to absorb moisture . These diseases , along with mosquito - and tick - borne diseases , are just a few VBN diseases that Arizona experts are monitoring . But there 's always the possibility for unknowns — for JJ diseases to show up unexpectedly — especially in tight living conditions . In more clustered spaces , Varsani VBD there 's a greater chance for an animal to become infected with CD JJ diseases at the same NN , opening the possibility for the birth of chimeras , or mash - ups , of CD JJ , related viruses . If CD viruses are infecting the same cell , when those viruses replicate , they can combine into a JJ hybrid NN that MD jump into JJ animals that were previously unaffected . "" You mix components and what you ’re then doing is you ’re allowing for these viral genomes to evolve very rapidly and adapt to a JJ host , "" he VBD . Varsani RB works to find and VB unknown viruses in remote areas , such as the polar regions . He has traveled to Antarctica nearly every NN since he RB visited about seven NNS ago , and VBD viruses he studies there MD have been RB for a while , but were only discovered recently . CD example is a circovirus that has only recently been noticed in penguins and that causes lethal feather loss . Viruses in the polar regions are just as abundant as they are in other parts of the NN , he VBD , and since the polar regions are expected to VB some of the most dramatic NNS due to NN NN , these regions and their viruses are crucial to understand for the future . As seen with the NN - CD outbreak , NNS for JJ diseases take NN to develop , as do tests to screen for them . Arizona and other NNS have come up with plans to deal with increased outbreaks and have vector - NN measures in place , but Brown acknowledged that it can be hard to prepare for JJ emerging diseases . "" It 's a JJ process to be able to come up with tests and identify JJ pathogens , especially when they 're not the ones you 're VBN to looking for . ” The Arizona Game and Fish Department monitors for JJ NN emergences by surveilling animal populations and investigating animal deaths to ensure that the NN of death was n't an unknown NN , according to Justice - Allen . Bett VBD NN care officials can take other measures to ensure that there is a structured , strong NN NN in place with contingency plans for NN outbreaks and centers where patients can be isolated or receive supportive treatment . “ I wonder to what extent the U.S. anticipated this spread . If you have good anticipation , that ’s a good JJ line of defense , "" Bett VBD . RB with further NN of NN effects on NN , there can be unpredicted challenges in trying to anticipate and address JJ diseases , VBD Ben Beard , the deputy director of the CDC ’s Division of Vector - Borne Diseases in Fort Collins , Colorado . "" While JJ term trends in NN NN can be modeled , specific NN events or disasters such as hurricanes , floods , or fires are very difficult to predict and MD have a JJ impact on NN outbreaks , "" he wrote in an email to The Republic . To prepare and respond to future outbreaks , he VBD , a strong JJ NN framework that prioritizes JJ NN surveillance , NN and local preparedness , and JJ - term research MD be necessary . In addition to being more conscious of how NNS affect the environment and existing ecosystems , Varsani VBD identifying and understanding the viruses present in the NN currently can VB society better prepare to VB them . This is no JJ feat , considering that viruses are among the most abundant entities on the NN . "" Viruses are understudied , "" he VBD . “ We have no idea what the next entity will be , nobody expected this outbreak to take place and it's now consumed most of the NN in a very short period . ” Amanda Morris covers all things bioscience , which includes NN care , technology , JJ research and the environment .

The report details a rapidly changing Arctic environment featuring melting NN , a greener landscape , and , alarmingly , NN - gas NNS on par with some JJ nations . The Arctic MD be releasing upwards of 600 CD tons of net NN per NN , the report finds , potentially putting the region alongside Mexico , Canada , and South Korea as CD of the NN ’s largest contributors to atmospheric CO2 . Though the NN emitted from such industrialized nations is the result of burning fossil fuels , the hundreds of millions of metric tons pumping out of the Arctic is the result of thawing permafrost . Permafrost being permafrost , it takes more than the seasons changing for it to actually melt it . The increasingly rapid thawing of frozen Arctic NN is the result of NN NN , and the NOAA ’s report card reveals that NNS are continuing to rise in the NN ’s nether - regions , which are n’t as icy as they VBD to be . In August , for instance , the average NN NN NNS in several highlighted Arctic bodies of NN were 1 - 7 degrees Celsius warmer than the average from 1982 - 2010 . Just as frightening : the average land NN NN north of 60 degrees N was the second - warmest since 1900 . It ’s not just permafrost that rising NNS are affecting . The report RB VBD : • None The Greenland NNP Sheet is losing 267 CD metric tons of NN per NN . • None CD of the five lowest months for North JJ Arctic snow cover in the 53 NNS records have been kept occurred this summer . • None NNP NN extent this summer was tied for the second - lowest since satellite imagery recorded coverage in 1979 . NN NN extent in the winter was RB second - lowest , narrowly falling short of the lowest - ever total , which occurred in …2018 . These NNS are threatening indigenous Arctic communities and Arctic wildlife directly , as well as the rest of the NN , on a profound scale . The deteriorating Greenland NNP Sheet is causing the JJ NN level to rise 0.7 millimeters per NN , and Arctic NN NNS are helping cook the NN at a rate that will soon be irreversible unless dramatic steps are taken . The NN for urgent NN was stressed Wednesday by teenage NN activist Greta Thunberg , who spoke to delegates at a NNP Nations NN summit in Madrid . “ Our leaders are not behaving as though we were in an emergency , ” VBD Thunberg , who the same day was named NNP magazine ’s Person of NNP . “ If there ’s a NN standing in the middle of the road and cars are coming at full speed , you do n’t look away because it is too uncomfortable . You immediately run out and rescue that NN . And without that sense of urgency , how can we , the NNS , understand that we are facing a real NN . ” Some governing bodies are at least trying . The European Commission on Wednesday revealed plans for a European Green Deal that MD reimagine the continent ’s economy in accordance with the NN NN . Meanwhile , the NN of the NN ’s second - largest NN emitter is dismantling efforts to fight the problem and struggling to RB feign concern . “ NN NN is very important to me , ” NNP NNP managed last week in London despite his penchant for slashing JJ regulations . “ I ’ve done JJ JJ impact statements over my NN and I VBP very strongly in very , very crystal clear , clean NN and clean air . That ’s a JJ part of NN NN . ” This post has been updated ."

Use_VB this_DT form_NN to_TO ask_VB your_PRP$ question_NN :_:","The NNP - CD lockdown has cut NN NN NNS - for now . But some governments VBP to VB further by harnessing their JJ recovery plans to boost low - NN industries . Their slogan is "" Build Back Better "" , but can they succeed ? I 've just had a light bulb moment . The feisty little wren chirping loudly in the matted ivy outside my back door is telling us something important about JJ NN NN . That 's because , intertwined with the melodious notes of a robin , I can actually hear its song clearly . Normally , both birds are muffled by the insistent rumble of traffic , but the din has been all but extinguished in the peace of lockdown . The drop in traffic is a major contributor to the fall in NN - NN CO2 NNS we 've witnessed globally . Before the NNP - CD NN , we accepted the dominance of traffic noise as an inevitable consequence of city living . Now , we have sampled an alternative urban ambience . Governments currently face a stark choice : bail out polluting businesses , VBG that as leverage to impose environmentally - minded reforms , or let them return to their NN - intensive activities as an JJ quick fix . But JJ members of the NN have little desire to return to the NN of affairs before lockdown . In a poll , a fifth of members of the motoring group the AA , VBD they MD work more from home in future . This has implications for the UK NN 's £ 28bn road - building programme which assumes that traffic will rise by 1 % per NN - a conjecture that now looks unlikely . The stay - at - home trend will be offset somewhat by nervous JJ transport NNS shunning trains for fear of infection , and by JJ - distance commuters who might decide that if they only VBP to visit the office three days a week , they 'll buy a home RB further away . The AA , which for NNS was seen as the voice of motorists , has asked the NN to VB again about its £ 28bn road expansion . Its NN , Edmund King , has suggested the NN MD be better spent on improving broadband Another likely winner from the NN is the movement fighting to turn city streets over to pedestrians and cyclists . This has already happened in places IN Paris , which is rolling out 650 km of "" corona cycle - ways "" , and Milan , which has a programme to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists . The determination to seize the moment for JJ NN stretches further than the transport sector . The UK is CD of several nations looking to reboot its JJ strategy by calling in favours from private industry . After all , it was NN which bailed out employers when the crunch came in March . The catchphrase is "" Build Back Better "" . But it MD seem to face a direct challenge in the shape of NNP and the US . The economies of both these superpowers have been savaged by the effects of NN . They are desperate to VB back to pre-virus levels of output , so their leaders MD VB the surest means of doing so is through tried and trusted NN NN fossil fuels . For those seeking a greener NN out of the NNP - CD slump , renewable NN will VB , along with electric vehicle charging points and broadband . Frans Timmermans , vice NN of the European Commission , is on the same track . He is leading work on a Green Deal to make the EU 's economy sustainable and VBZ that not a single Euro should be spent propping up old , dirty industries . All NNP - CD recovery investment should VB towards commerce that either helps reduce NN NNS or promotes digital business , he insists . But some MEPs from parties on the NN warn that the NN will have "" far - reaching "" JJ and JJ consequences . They insist the EU must scale back its pre-crisis NN ambitions . That 's led some governments , IN Germany and the UK , to offer hand - outs to polluting industries without imposing green conditions . In the UK , the issue is causing contortions among politicians torn between saving existing jobs and conserving the NN . MPs from the Liberal Democrats - thought of as CD of the "" greenest "" UK parties - have joined other parliamentarians in demanding a conditional rescue for the airline industry . They VBP that if ministers do n't step in , tens of thousands of jobs will be lost . But the firms should promise to off - set their NNS by , for example , planting trees . Off - setting is hugely contentious . Doug Parr , chief scientist at Greenpeace , argues : "" Any NN bailout should focus on workers , not the industry itself . "" It should be conditional on the industry agreeing to shrink until - if ever - low - NN technology is available - which is n't now . "" That begs a question : which industries should qualify for support ? Should cash VB exclusively to self - evidently green sectors IN solar NN - or to dirty firms trying to clean up ? Take the fossil fuel firms that pay our pension dividends by drilling for the stuff that 's over - heating the NN . The UK's oil and gas industry warns that 30,000 jobs MD be lost because of the NN and the current low oil NN . But why MD governments support a commodity that 's fuelling the NN NN , which is judged by the UN to be deeper than the NNP - CD NN ? Perhaps it 's not that simple . Lord Stern , the JJ Treasury chief who 's now a NN expert , VBD me each firm should be judged on its trajectory , not on its current NN . "" The oil and gas industries are producing stuff you VBP to run down very quickly , "" he VBD . "" But you do VB some NNS - IN BP and Shell - which are declaring they are moving in a direction where they VBP to be VBG zero NN . "" So , you ca n't be indiscriminate or dogmatic . You have to look where the industry is VBG . "" At least UK environmentalists are dealing with firms that agree on the NN to tackle NN NN . In the US , some fossil fuel firms have been determined to pursue NN bail - outs without strings binding them to a less polluting future . The Democratic Party has a JJ - standing proposal for a "" Green NNP Deal "" to promote clean technology . But NNP Donald NNP has minimised the importance of NN NN . He has promised to VB struggling fossil fuel firms , although his efforts have not taken root in a major NN . Then there 's NNP . In 2015 , its leaders were persuaded by NNP Barack Obama to make major NN NN commitments as part of the Paris NN agreement . Since then , NNP has suffered job losses and fuel shortages . Beijing has resorted to a quick fix for the economy by building coal - fired NN plants . The green NN tank NNP NNP Monitor VBZ the number of plants NNP approved in the JJ three weeks of March 2020 - equivalent to 7,960 megawatts ( MW ) - was more than the number agreed in the whole of 2019 ( 6,310 MW ) . • A SIMPLE GUIDE : How do I protect myself ? • AVOIDING CONTACT : The rules on self - isolation and exercise • TESTING : Can I VB tested for NN ? That does n't take into account NNP 's estimated $ 1 trillion investment in its "" Belt and Road "" initiative to build huge , NN - intensive infrastructure projects across developing NNS . Unless NNP and NNP NNP VBP their spots ( or the Democratic candidate wins the US NN ) , Europe 's Build Back Better campaign wo n't be enough to protect the increasingly fragile NN , RB if it does engineer a green recovery . And we have a lesson from history . Nick Robins from the London School of Economics ( LSE ) estimates that in the JJ financial NN of 2008 just 16 % of JJ stimulus plans were green - mainly because NNP invested massively in fossil fuel projects . He tells me : "" If we have any hope of combating NN NN , we must make absolutely sure we do it better this NN .

It seems that if JJ - induced JJ NN continues on its current trajectory , the NN 's beer supply will dry up . You read that RB : If JJ - induced JJ NN continues on its current trajectory , the NN 's beer supply will dry up . Forget the other aspects of JJ NN : devastating and more frequent hurricanes ; hotter - than - normal summers ; longer droughts ; wildfires ; rising NN levels . We MD run out of beer , NNS ! Researchers , in a NN published Oct. 15 , 2018 , in the journal Nature Plants , ran the numbers and concluded that excessive and prolonged heat waves and droughts will ravage the NN 's barley supply . As any imbiber of beer will tell you , barley is the main ingredient in any good pint . As these fields of taste and wonder disappear , the laws of supply and demand will muscle in . Beer prices will surge , which means only the well - heeled will be able to afford a frosty mug of brew . No trickle - down economics here . The hoi polis — you , me and our friends — will be left high and dry . Ireland MD VB a 193 percent NN increase , depending on the severity of conditions . "" The NN is facing JJ NN - threatening impacts of NN NN , so NNS having to spend a bit more to drink beer MD seem trivial by comparison , "" co-author Steven Davis , UCI associate professor of NNP NN NN VBD in a statement . "" But there is definitely a cross-cultural appeal to beer , and not having a cool pint at the end of an increasingly common hot day just adds insult to injury .

If their models are accurate , the regions of the NN where barley grows , especially the prairies of Canada , the northern Great Plains of the NNP NNPS , and parts of Europe , Asia and Australia , will VB hotter and drier , causing crop yields to decline 3 to 17 percent . RB modest NN will lead to more drought and heat in these areas , the NNS VBP . As a result , beer prices will VB up in beer - loving NNS , including Belgium , Canada , Denmark and Poland . If you love spending NN chugging in Ireland , you will VB an extra $ 20 to buy a six - pack . Moreover , NNS in poorer NNS will VB beer consumption VB down .

"" Our results show that in the most severe NN events , the supply of beer MD decline by about 16 percent in NNS when droughts and heat waves strike , "" Davis VBD .

NN dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least the past 800,000 NNS . In fact , the last NN the atmospheric CO amounts were this high was more than 3 CD NNS ago , when NN was 2°–3 °C ( 3.6°–5.4 °F ) higher than during the pre-industrial era , and NN level was 15 – 25 meters ( 50 – 80 NNS ) higher than today . NN dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that NNS are burning for NN . Fossil fuels IN coal and oil contain NN that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of JJ millions of NNS ; we are returning that NN to the atmosphere in just a few hundred NNS . Squeeze or stretch the graph in either direction by holding the Shift key while you click and drag . The bright red line ( source NNS ) shows monthly average NN dioxide at NOAA 's Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawai'i in parts per CD ( ppm ) : the number of NN dioxide molecules per CD molecules of dry air . Over the course of the NN , values are higher in Northern Hemisphere winter and lower in summer . The dark red line shows the annual trend , calculated as a 12 - month rolling average . According to the NN of the NNP in 2018 report from NOAA and the NNP Meteorological Society , JJ atmospheric NN dioxide was 407.4 ± 0.1 ppm in 2018 , a JJ record high . That is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2017 , similar to the increase of 2.2 ± 0.1 ppm between CD and 2017 . In the 1960s , the JJ growth rate of atmospheric NN dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per NN . Over the past decade , however , the growth rate has been closer to 2.3 ppm per NN . The annual rate of increase in atmospheric NN dioxide over the past 60 NNS is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases , such as those that occurred at the end of the last NN age 11,000 - 17,000 NNS ago . NN dioxide is a NN gas : a gas that absorbs and radiates heat . Warmed by sunlight , NNP ’s land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared NN ( heat ) . Unlike oxygen or nitrogen ( which make up most of our atmosphere ) , NN gases absorb that heat and release it gradually over NN , IN bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out . Without this natural NN effect , NNP ’s average annual NN MD be below freezing instead of close to 60 °F . But increases in NN gases have tipped the NNP 's NN budget out of balance , trapping additional heat and raising NNP 's average NN . NN dioxide is the most important of NNP ’s RB - lived NN gases . It absorbs less heat per molecule than the NN gases methane or nitrous oxide , but it ’s more abundant and it stays in the atmosphere much longer . And while NN dioxide is less abundant and less powerful than NN vapor on a molecule per molecule basis , it absorbs wavelengths of thermal NN that NN vapor does not , which means it adds to the NN effect in a unique NN . Increases in atmospheric NN dioxide are responsible for about CD - thirds of the total NN imbalance that is causing NNP 's NN to rise . Another reason NN dioxide is important in the NNP NN is that it dissolves into the ocean IN the fizz in a can of soda . It reacts with NN molecules , producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean 's pH . Since the start of the Industrial Revolution , the pH of the ocean 's NN waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10 . This drop in pH is called ocean acidification . A drop of 0.1 MD not seem IN a lot , but the pH scale is logarithmic ; a 1 - unit drop in pH means a tenfold increase in acidity . A NN of 0.1 means a roughly 30 % increase in acidity . Increasing acidity interferes with the ability of marine NN to extract calcium from the NN to build their shells and skeletons . Natural increases in NN dioxide concentrations have periodically warmed NNP ’s NN during NN age cycles over the past CD NNS or more . The warm episodes ( interglacials ) began with a JJ increase in sunlight due to a tiny wobble in NNP ’s axis of rotation or in the path of its orbit IN the NNP . That little bit of extra sunlight caused a little bit of NN . As the oceans warmed , they outgassed NN dioxide — IN a can of soda VBG JJ in the heat of a summer day . The extra NN dioxide in the atmosphere amplified the initial NN . VBN on air bubbles trapped in mile - thick NN cores ( and other paleoclimate NN ) , we VBP that during the NN age cycles of the past CD NNS or so , NN dioxide never exceeded 300 ppm . Before the Industrial Revolution started in the mid-1700s , the JJ average amount of NN dioxide was about 280 ppm . By the NN continuous observations began at Mauna Loa Volcanic Observatory in 1958 , JJ atmospheric NN dioxide was already 315 ppm . On NNP 9 , 2013 , the daily average NN dioxide measured at Mauna Loa surpassed 400 ppm for the JJ NN on record . Less than CD NNS later , in 2015 , the JJ amount went over 400 ppm for the JJ NN . If JJ NN demand continues to grow and to be met mostly with fossil fuels , atmospheric NN dioxide is projected to exceed 900 ppm by the end of this century . Collins , M. , R. Knutti , J.

This agreement is for an exclusive JJ license to commercialise a novel NN technology from the John Curtin School of NNP Research at ANU . Dengue Fever is the lead indication , but the technology MD RB facilitate the design of NNS against a number of other infectious diseases including Murray River encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis . The increasing incidence of mosquito - borne NN is a major NN concern worldwide as NN NN expands the range of the carrier mosquitoes , exposing larger JJ populations . The agreement includes provision for BioDiem to sublicense the technology . Industry standard royalties apply , but apart from a JJ contribution towards patent registration costs there is no up - front outlay for BioDiem . The agreement follows the signing of a term sheet announced to the ASX on 6 June 2012 . Dengue Fever is a NN caused by a mosquito - borne NN that affects between 50 and 100 CD NNS a NN , and according to the NNP NNP Organization the incidence is increasing significantly . Although only a JJ percentage of NNS are fatal , non-fatal NNS can be extremely debilitating . Dengue Fever currently has no existing NN , and NN methods currently include attempts to address mosquito populations with varying effectiveness . The technology is complementary to the BioDiem portfolio as well as the NN 's strategic focus on NNS and therapies for infectious diseases and related cancers . "" We are delighted to announce the completion of this licensing agreement , which sees BioDiem 's commercial expertise in the area of NNS fittingly partnered with the exciting research developed by ANU . Our focus on infectious diseases is an excellent fit for this JJ technology which has strong potential as an asset for outlicensing "" VBD BioDiem CEO Julie Phillips . BioDiem 's current strategy for the ANU technology includes leveraging the NN 's JJ partnering network to deliver an outlicensing partner for development of the technology , providing an opportunity to secure a royalties stream without significant development costs on the part of BioDiem . BioDiem is an ASX - listed NN VBN in Melbourne with an international focus on discovering , developing and commercialising NN - class research and technology targeting cancers and infectious diseases . BioDiem 's core technologies include the Live Attenuated Influenza NNP ( LAIV ) , the SAVINE platform and the BDM - I antimicrobial compound . The LAIV influenza NN is an intranasal NN to prevent infection from seasonal and NN influenza . The LAIV influenza NN can be produced VBG both egg - VBN and cell - VBN manufacturing methods . The cell - VBN LAIV NN has completed a Phase II clinical trial in Europe . The egg - VBN LAIV NN technology is licensed to the NNP NNP Organization as part of the NNP NNP Influenza NNP Plan to Increase NNP Supply . The LAIV influenza NN is marketed as Nasovac™ in India by the Serum Institute of India , and has been licensed to NNP - VBN Changchun BCHT Biotechnology Co . The LAIV NN was in - licensed from the Institute of Experimental Medicine in St Petersburg , NNP where it has been VBN for over a decade in JJ millions of NNS - NNS , adults and the elderly . The LAIV is administered by nasal spray and induces a rapid JJ response in the mucosal lining of the nose and pharynx . The LAIV is RB being developed as a viral vector for making novel non-influenza NNS for JJ diseases including cancers . Viruses have the ability to generate proteins prolifically and can be programmed to produce NN - specific proteins . As part of a NN , NN - specific proteins can VB generate a beneficial JJ response . SAVINE ( patented Scrambled Antigen NNP ) is a platform technology for the design of antigens for incorporation into NNS targeting an JJ response to a range of JJ diseases . SAVINE antigens are encoded as synthetic genes which , together with a delivery technology such as BioDiem 's LAIV - VBN NN vector technology , can be VBN to develop novel NNS . BDM - I is a synthetic compound targeted at the treatment of serious JJ infections . BDM - I is in the preclinical stage with outlicensing as the intended outcome . BDM - I is active against a range of pathogenic micro-organisms including gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria , fungi and protozoa . Key patents have been filed IN BDM - I 's antimicrobial activity , including for activity against Plasmodium falciparum , responsible for causing the most commonly severe form of malaria , and Trichomonas vaginalis , the protozoan responsible for causing a common sexually transmitted NN named trichomoniasis . BioDiem is RB developing BDM-E , a tetra peptide synthetic compound , as a treatment for ophthalmic disorders . The US Food & Drug Administration ( USFDA ) has granted Orphan Drug designation to BDM-E for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa , a serious degenerative NN of the retina . BioDiem 's research is ongoing in partnership with internationally recognised laboratories . For additional NN , please visit www.biodiem.com"

RB , we performed future projections without socio-economic developments to show the effect of NN NN only . Next , an integrated assessment is performed including future NNS in land use , NN demand and population . This allows us to disentangle the effects of NN and socio-economic NNS . In general , the NN projections reveal a typically North - South pattern across Europe for NN availability .

The average JJ NN has increased by 1 °C since the start of the Industrial Revolution , the 600 - page report VBZ — adding that the last 115 NNS comprise “ the warmest period in the history of modern civilization ” . The analysis warns that NNS MD increase another 4°C by the end of the century , with dramatic consequences for NNS and natural ecosystems . The findings are at odds with the policies of US NNP Donald NNP , who has questioned well - established tenets of NN NN and vowed to protect and promote the US fossil - fuel industry . NNP 's stances led JJ NNS to worry that his administration MD try to block or tamper with the NN - NN assessment , but several NNS who helped to write the document reported no problems . “ We were n’t interfered with , and we ended up producing something that I VBP is of tremendous value , ” VBZ David Fahey , an atmospheric scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder , Colorado , and a coordinating lead author of the analysis . The NN - NN report is the JJ volume of the fourth National NNP Assessment , a legally mandated analysis of the causes and impacts of JJ NN that is due in 2018 . The other CD parts of the forthcoming assessment were released today in draft form , for JJ comment . CD analysis focuses on how NN NN is affecting NN in the NNP NNPS , from crop yields to property damage from extreme NN . The other summarizes the latest findings on the JJ NN cycle . Both of those documents will undergo a formal review by the US National Academy of Sciences . “ The NN speaks for itself , ” VBZ Don Wuebbles , a a NN scientist at the NNP of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and co-chair of the NN - NN report . “ It ’s hard to counteract the basic observations and the truth of the NN with any kind of JJ playing RB . ” The trio of documents paints a dramatic picture of how JJ NN is affecting NNS and communities across the NNP NNPS . Tidal flooding is accelerating in more than 25 coastal cities along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico . JJ forest fires have become more frequent in the western part of the country , while warmer spring NNS and shrinking mountain snowpack are combining to reduce the amount of NN available to the region 's cities and farms . As a result , the draft NN - impacts report warns , “ chronic , JJ - duration hydrological drought is increasingly possible before the end of the century ” . The report comes just days before the latest NNP Nations NN talks kick off in Bonn , Germany . It will RB be the JJ major summit since NNP vowed to pull the NNP NNPS out of the 2015 Paris NN pact . Few observers expect US NN 's latest set of NN - NN analyses to affect how the NNP administation approaches NN and JJ issues . In August , the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration disbanded an advisory committee that was intended to VB the nation prepare for a warmer NN , by translating the findings of the coming NN assessment into guidance for cities , NNS and industry . Nor is it clear whether senior NNP administration officials will accept the reports ' core scientific conclusions . As recently as March , US NNP Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt VBD he did not VB that NN dioxide is major driver of JJ NN . Nonetheless , JJ NNS and environmentalists lauded the JJ reports for bolstering the NN for more - aggressive NN against NN NN . “ The full assessment , when it gets published , is VBG to show that there are palpable impacts that are VBG to hit every part of the country , ” VBZ Andrew Light , a senior fellow at the NNP Resources Institute , an JJ NN - tank in NNP DC . “ It ’s the responsibility of leaders to take note of that and act accordingly . ”"

He was RB the eldest son of NNP John Adams , the second U.S. NN . John Quincy Adams was the eldest son of NNP John Adams and the sixth NN of the NNP NNPS . In his pre-presidential NNS , Adams was CD of NNP 's greatest diplomats ( formulating , among other things , what became the Monroe Doctrine ) ; in his post - presidential NNS , he conducted a consistent and often dramatic fight against the expansion of slavery . Though full of promise , his presidential NNS were difficult . He died in 1848 in NNP , D.C . Though he was CD of few Americans to be so prepared to serve as NN of the NNP NNPS , John Quincy Adams 's best NNS of service came before and after his NN in the White NNP . Born on July 11 , 1767 , in Braintree , Massachusetts , John Quincy was the son of John Adams , a prodigy of the NNP Revolution who MD become the second U.S. NN just before his John Quincy 's 30th birthday , and his wife , future JJ lady Abigail Adams . As a NN , Adams witnessed firsthand the birth of the nation . From the family farm , he and his mother watched the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775 . At age CD , he traveled to France with his father , who was securing aid during the Revolution . By age 14 , Adams was receiving "" on - the - job "" training in the diplomatic corps and VBG to school . In 1781 , he accompanied diplomat Francis Dana to NNP , serving as his secretary and translator . In 1783 , he traveled to Paris to serve as secretary to his father , negotiating the Treaty of Paris . During this NN , Adams attended schools in Europe and became fluent in French , Dutch and German . Returning home in 1785 , he entered Harvard College and graduated in 1787 . In 1790 , Adams became a practicing attorney in Boston . As tensions mounted between Britain and France , he supported NNP George NNP 's neutrality policy of 1793 . NNP NNP appreciated young Adams 's support so much that he appointed him U.S. minister to Holland . When his father was elected NN in 1797 , he appointed his son U.S. minister to Prussia . On the NN to his post , Adams traveled to England to wed Louisa Catherine Johnson , the daughter of Joshua Johnson , the JJ U.S. consul to Great Britain . After his father lost his bid for a second term in 1800 , he recalled his son from Prussia . In 1802 , Adams was elected to the Massachusetts legislature , and CD NN later , he was elected the U.S. Senate . IN his father , Adams was considered a member of the Federalist Party , but in truth , he was never a strict party NN . During his NN in the Senate , he supported the Louisiana Purchase and NNP Thomas Jefferson 's Embargo Act—actions that made him very unpopular with other Federalists . In June 1808 , Adams broke with the Federalists , resigned from his Senate seat and became a Democratic - Republican . Adams returned to the diplomatic corps in 1809 , when NNP James Madison appointed him the JJ officially recognized minister to NNP ( Francis Dana was never officially accepted as a U.S. ambassador by the Russian NN ) . In 1814 , Adams was recalled from NNP to serve as chief negotiator for the U.S. NN during the Treaty of Ghent , settling the NNP of 1812 . The following NN , Adams served as minister to England , a position his father had held 30 NNS earlier . In a post he was most suited for , Adams served as secretary of NN in NNP James Monroe 's administration from 1817 to 1825 . During this NN , he negotiated the Adams - Onis Treaty , acquiring Florida for the NNP NNPS . He RB helped negotiate the Treaty of 1818 , settling the JJ - standing border dispute between Britain and the NNP NNPS over the Oregon Country , and initiating improved relations between Great Britain and its JJ colonies . By age 50 , Adams had amassed a very impressive record of JJ service , but perhaps his most notable and enduring achievement was the Monroe Doctrine . After the Napoleonic wars had ended , several Latin JJ colonies of Spain rose up and declared independence . A defining moment for the NNP NNPS , Adams crafted the Monroe Doctrine , which stated the NNP NNPS MD resist any European country 's efforts to thwart independence movements in Latin NNP ; the doctrine , RB introduced in 1823 , served to justify U.S. intervention in Latin NNP throughout the late 19th and most of the 20th centuries . By 1824 , Adams was well - positioned to be the next NN of the NNP NNPS . However , the JJ NN had changed the NN presidents were elected at the NN ; only the Democratic - Republican Party was viable and five candidates emerged , each representing JJ sections of the country . Running against Adams were Southerners John C. Calhoun and William Crawford , and Westerners Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson . In addition , by the 1824 NN , 18 of 24 NNS had moved to choose electors to the Electoral College by popular vote instead of to NN legislatures . In the Electoral College vote , no CD candidate had a clear majority and , subsequently , the NN was sent to the NNP of Representatives . Clay threw his support to Adams , who was elected on the JJ ballot . Adams 's victory shocked Jackson , who had won the popular vote and fully expected to be NN . When Adams later appointed Clay secretary of NN , Jackson Democrats cried "" corrupt bargain , "" and were enraged at the seemingly quid pro quo arrangement . Adams entered the presidency with several debilitating JJ liabilities . He possessed the temperament of his father : Aloof , stubborn and ferociously independent in his convictions . As NN , Adams failed to develop the JJ relationships needed — RB among members of his own party — to effect significant NN . It did n't VB that his JJ opponents were set on making him a CD - term NN . In his JJ NN in office , Adams proposed several far - sighted programs that he felt MD promote NN , as well as encourage a spirit of enterprise and invention in the NNP NNPS ; these goals included building a network of highways and canals to link the JJ sections of the country , setting aside JJ lands for conservation , surveying the entire U.S. coast and building astronomical observatories . Adams RB saw the NN for practical solutions to universal problems , thusly calling for the establishment of a uniform NN of weights and measures and improving the patent NN . While these MD have been admirable goals for an aspiring nation , they were considered overambitious and unrealistic for the NNP NNPS in the 1820s . Adams 's proposals were met with scorn and derision by JJ opponents ; critics charged that the NN 's policies MD enlarge the powers and influence of the federal NN at the expense of the NN and local governments , and some accused Adams of promoting programs to enhance the elite and neglect the common NNS . In the midterm NN of 1826 , Jacksonian opponents won majorities in both Houses of Congress . As a result , JJ of Adams 's initiatives either failed to pass legislation or were woefully underfunded . The NN of 1828 was an especially bitter and personal affair . As was the tradition , neither candidate personally campaigned , but supporters conducted ruthless attacks on the opposing candidates . The campaign reached a low point when the press accused Jackson 's wife , Rachel , of bigamy . Adams lost the NN by a decisive margin , and he left NNP without attending Jackson 's inauguration . Adams did not retire from JJ NN after leaving the presidential office . In 1830 , he ran for and won a seat in the U.S. NNP of Representatives , once again distinguishing himself as a statesman of the JJ order . In 1836 , Adams focused his JJ - standing anti-slavery sentiment on defeating a gag - rule instituted by Southerners to stifle debate . In 1841 , he argued in front of the Supreme NNP on behalf of escaped African slaves in the famous Amistad NN , and won the release of the captives . On February 21 , 1848 , in his last contribution to his country , Adams was on the floor of the NNP of Representatives , arguing to honor U.S. Army officers who had served in the Mexican - NNP NNP ( he opposed the NN , but felt that the U.S. NN was obligated to honor its veterans ) . During the event , Adams suddenly collapsed , suffering from a massive cerebral hemorrhage . He was taken to the Speaker 's Room in the Capitol Building , where he died CD days later , on February 23 , 1848 ."

""_''","VB breaking NN alerts and special reports . The NN and stories that matter , delivered weekday mornings . More than 100 bushfires are raging in Australia as the continent swelters under record heat , a double whammy of extremes that has amplified scrutiny of what experts VBP is stark inaction from the NN on NN NN . Blazes across NNP South Wales and Queensland have scorched almost 7 CD acres , and Australia experienced its hottest day on record Wednesday , when the average NN across the country hit 105 degrees . The nation 's woes are unfolding as Australia faces criticism for what have been described as its inadequate NN policies , including the role of federal officials in thwarting negotiations at a recent U.N. summit on NN NN . Richie Merzian , director of the NN and NN program at the Australia Institute , a Canberra - VBN NN tank that conducts JJ policy research , called the 2019 NNP Nations Framework Convention on NNP NNP a letdown . The summit ended Sunday in a stalemate , with NNS largely delaying major decisions on plans to cut NN NNS until next NN 's conference . "" It was terribly disappointing , "" Merzian VBD . "" Australia is literally on fire RB now , and it 's clearly linked to NN NN in terms of its severity and duration . But instead of VBG there to rally the NN behind the NN for greater NN NN , Australia was lobbying to do as little as possible . "" Seasonal bushfires occur naturally in Australia , but hotter and drier conditions due to NN NN have increased the frequency of fires and their severity , VBD Andy Pitman , a NN modeler at the NNP of NNP South Wales in Sydney . "" There is an uncontroversial link whereby higher NN dioxide levels in the atmosphere from NN NN increase bushfire NN , "" Pitman VBD . "" All other things being equal , a fire that occurs now will be worse than a fire that occurred 20 to 30 NNS ago . "" Trees play an integral role in the NN 's NN cycle by absorbing NN dioxide as they grow . But research has shown that when vegetation dries out — as during hot and dry summer months — the increased amount of NN dioxide acts as extra fuel for wildfires . JJ activities , such as burning fossil fuels , release NN gases that trap heat and raise NN NNS . A 2018 NN of the NN report from the Australian NN 's Bureau of Meteorology VBD that the country has warmed by just over 1 degree Celsius since 1910 , "" leading to an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events . "" Those heat waves , combined with dry conditions , are dangerous ingredients for bushfires , Pitman VBD , with circumstances appearing to be particularly severe at the moment . "" This is unprecedented , "" Pitman VBD . "" I do n't VB we 've ever seen bushfires at this scale before . "" Bushfires are RB problematic because they release NN dioxide into the atmosphere . Australia 's fires are estimated to have emitted 250 CD tons of NN dioxide already — nearly half of the nation 's total yearly average NNS — according to NNP NNS provided to The Guardian . Those events have renewed focus on Australia 's prime minister , Scott Morrison , who has refused to answer questions about NN NN and their link to the fires . His conservative administration has RB faced backlash for its policies and rhetoric surrounding JJ NN . In November , Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack VBD NN NN concerns were stoked by "" raving inner-city lefties , "" adding that there had been fires in Australia "" since NN began . "" Pitman VBD that while there had been some progress made on the NN level , the federal NN had shown a lack of JJ will . "" They almost VBP it as a negotiating or debating point , and it's not , "" Pitman VBD . "" This is an existential NN to communities and major regions of the NN , and if governments do n't act , then the situation will simply deteriorate . "" Imran Ahmad , a NN scientist at Australian National NNP , VBD the Morrison administration 's stance was symptomatic of Australia 's complex history of NN NN policy . "" There is an ideological drive against NN NN by certain vested interests , "" he VBD . Australia is the NN 's largest exporter of coal and its third - largest exporter of fossil fuels , after NNP and Saudi Arabia . Merzian , who worked as a NN negotiator for the NN for almost a decade , VBD those JJ ties have shaped the country 's NN policies for decades — and invite international criticism . "" You ca n't be the largest exporter of coal , which is the largest source of NN gas NNS when consumed , and not take any responsibility for that , "" Merzian VBD .

The council adopted a NNP NNP Strategy in April 2014 , which was refreshed in 2017 to bring it up to speed with other local and national developments in the NN NN agenda . It included the adoption of national targets IN NN emission reductions and the use of renewable NN . The following three pledges underpin the work the council has been doing on NN NN : • To lead by example in reducing its NN NNS NN on NN . • To VB residents , community groups and businesses to reduce their NNS and manage NN risks . • To work with partners to VB raise awareness and support initiatives to reduce and mitigate the impacts of NN NN . We are now developing a draft NNP NNP and Air Quality Strategy that we plan to publish for consultation later in 2020 . This will outline the steps that we ’ll be taking to tackle the issue and reduce our impact on the environment . The drive to become a NN neutral borough by 2030 starts now and we have started work to set out the steps we as a council can take and how we can work together as a borough . In December 2019 , we held a NN NN summit to bring together ideas with partners . View a copy of the presentation and the Outcomes Report . Already we have : • Installed solar panels on the roof of several of our council buildings . • Improved the NN performance of the council ’s Deanes and Parklands buildings • Set up a group of Environment Champions to promote sustainable practices among staff . • Installed a fresh air cooling NN at the Civic Offices , as well as being environmentally - friendly , the initiative will generate a saving of £ 9,500 per NN . • Reduced the distances our bin trucks travel by rebalancing the rounds , with a monthly NN saving of 3.8 % per month . With partners , we have : • Adopted a transport strategy with a focus on encouraging more sustainable transport including cycling and walking . • Given out loans and grants to improve insulation and install renewable NN sources . • Supported residents to apply for NN funding for NN efficient boilers . We are working on our next steps looking at greener ways of delivering council services . Here are just a few of the projects we are working on : • With advice from the NNP Savings Trust we are exploring greater use of electric vehicles . • Updating our Local Plan to ensure tougher standards associated with NN NN and NNS . • Reviewing the NN efficiency of our accommodation and our staff and councillors ’ travel . • Delivering 3,500 homes at Manydown VBG the Garden Towns ’ principle ."

The shocking truth , as he VBZ , is that chemtrails are part of a benevolent program aimed at countering JJ NN . By cooperating in secret with jet fuel manufacturers , NN agents have carefully kept the massive chemtrail efforts completely under wraps . “ I am only revealing this program because there is no oversight in the scientific community , no JJ discussion , and little concern for the side - effects which are well VBN only to a few privileged NNS interested in continuing the decades - JJ chemtrail program in secret . ” According to Snowden , chemtrails are the only thing keeping the US from JJ NN incineration , but at what NN ? Because NN NN is a threat to U.S. agriculture , it has been labeled a national security issue . With the influence and cooperation of Monsanto , a secret Geo-engineering lab dubbed Muad ’Dib has been operating since the late 1960s , and the chemtrail program is often referred to by insiders as its “ crown jewel . ” Muad ’Dib has aimed to protect North NNP ’s NN at all costs – RB if that means accelerating desertification in Sub -Saharan Africa or spreading trace amounts of carcinogens over lightly populated areas . Other side effects , which NNS at the secret Muad ’Dib Geoengineering Lab have predicted , include droughts in the Amazon and powerful windstorms along the East Coast . Snowden shared decisive documents with The Internet Chronicle , but out of concern for national security , only his testimonial can be published . These documents contain references to NNS who MD surely be targeted by foreign counterintelligence , and their NN is vital to short - term survival of the NNP NNPS . Snowden VBD , “ If this program were to stop , the NNS behind it strongly VBP that within just CD NN the North JJ NN MD spiral out of NN , and crop failures MD lead to a series of devastating famines that MD quickly depopulate urban centers . ” Because the program has been carried out on such a massive scale , skeptics might find Snowden ’s story unbelievable . However , Snowden explained that the chemtrail program has been incredibly easy to hide , especially with the cooperation of jet fuel NNS , a crucial part of the NN - industrial complex . Snowden VBD , “ The chemicals which are released by passenger airplanes have been covertly introduced as ‘ additives , ’ supposedly to improve efficiency . Only as the plane reaches cruising velocity does the heat and atmospheric pressure VBP a chemical reaction that synthesizes the top secret NN - trapping molecule . This process is imperfect , and JJ of the by - NNS are incredibly dangerous RB in trace quantities . The most dangerous thing is that although chemtrails are keeping the NN of the U.S. reasonably stable , citizens are bombarded every day with an invisible rain of NN - laden molecules , and the effect on NN is totally unknown . ”"

His previous writing indicates that he believes a shadowy cabal of bankers is controlling NN affairs . He VBZ the NNP Nations is VBG NN NN to lay the foundations for an unelected JJ NN . Malcolm Roberts won a Queensland Senate seat as member of the anti-immigration NNP Nation party in recent elections . Malcolm Roberts believes the NNP Nations is attempting to create an unelected JJ NN The party won four seats in Australia ’s Senate during the NN , making it the fourth - largest voting bloc in the upper NN . The BBC has asked Mr Roberts for an interview and submitted questions to him by email , but has not received a reply . CD Nation leader Pauline Hanson will wield considerable NN in Australia ’s Senate But in recent interviews with the Australian Broadcasting Corp ( ABC ) , Mr Roberts stood by his previous positions . He called for an investigation into Australia ’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) over its handling of NN NN NN . When asked if he still believed the UN was trying to impose a worldwide NN through NN NN policy , Mr Roberts answered : “ Definitely ” . In 2011 , Mr Roberts wrote a letter to then Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard demanding to be exempted from the country ’s NN tax . The letter , addressed to “ The Woman , Julia - Eileen : Gillard ” , contained a 28 - point affidavit that sought to establish Mr Roberts ’ exemption from the NN to obey the Australian NN . He referred to himself as “ Malcolm - Ieuan : Roberts . , the living soul ” , and identified himself as the “ beneficiary , administrator ” for a corporate entity called MALCOLM IEUAN ROBERTS . The punctuation and language is consistent with a style of language VBN by the so - called sovereign citizen movement , which sees governments as illegitimate and attempts to assert the rights of individuals to ignore laws and taxes . The use of unusual grammar and punctuation by sovereign citizens is intended to establish independence from the NN ’s legal NN . A screen grab of the letter Mr Roberts sent to Ms Gillard , expressing a view that Australia MD be a US corporation However , in a radio interview with the ABC , Mr Roberts denied that he was affiliated with the movement . Mr Roberts RB wrote a report in 2013 entitled CSRIOh ! : NN of Deception , Or JJ Step to Freedom ? that detailed his rejection of man-made JJ NN . “ The UN IPCC ’s unfounded core claim about JJ CO2 is part of UN Agenda 21 campaign for JJ governance , ” the report VBD . In a 135 - page appendix to the report , Mr Roberts wrote in detail about his belief that an international cabal of bankers is exercising enormous influence on NN affairs . The report VBZ the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England are privately controlled corporations , and that their owners are seeking to introduce NN trading into the NN economy as a NN to generate NN and extend their NN . It RB lists Holocaust denier and NN theorist Eustace Mullins as a primary reference . Mr Roberts has been criticised in the past by prominent Australian NN sceptic Andrew Bolt , who VBD his NNS on banking families “ smacks too much of the Jewish NN NN theorising I ’ve always loathed ” . But in the report Mr Roberts writes that those who “ falsely smear or imply those raising the topic [ of the international banking scam ] as anti-Jewish … is an unfounded furphy [ an untruth ] designed to distract . The reality is that international bankers come from a variety of religions . ” Mr Roberts VBD the ABC that his top priorities as a senator were “ accountability ” for the NN and “ restoring the constitution ” , relieving cost - of - living pressures , JJ security and security from terrorism ."

This is somewhat understandable since the CD concepts overlap a great deal . In fact , there is a causal relationship between the CD . However , there are some subtle and some not - so - subtle differences between JJ NN and NN NN . The phrase JJ NN is VBN by NNS to mean a JJ - term increase in NNP ’s average air NN . It can refer specifically to such NN that is due to the influence of rising concentrations of NN gases in the atmosphere . NNP ’s NN gets most of its heat from the NN associated with the NNP ’s rays , which strike the NN ’s NN during the day . At night most of this NN is radiated back into NN . NN gases ( such as NN dioxide , methane , nitrous oxides , and chlorofluorocarbons [ CFCs ] ) absorb infrared radiation ( net heat NN ) emitted from NNP ’s NN and radiate it back to the NN , thus contributing to the NN effect . Though the recent rise in NN gases in the atmosphere is arguably the main factor affecting JJ NN , other factors are involved ( such as variations in NNP ’s orbit , the angle of the NN ’s axis , and variations in the NNP ’s NN output ) . Nevertheless , as higher concentrations of NN gases allow NNP ’s atmosphere to hold on to greater amounts of heat that MD normally escape into NN at night , NNP ’s average NN rises . NN NN is a bit JJ . Before we look into what NN NN is , it MD be helpful to VB a bit about NN with respect to NN . NN , which is often confused with NN , is the set of conditions in the atmosphere in CD location for a limited period of NN , such as throughout the day , at night , or at any particular point during the day . NN , on the other hand , is the average condition of the atmosphere in a given location over a JJ period of NN , such as 30 NNS or more . Thus , NN NN is a longer - term NN in the average condition of the atmosphere . JJ beings most certainly contribute to NN NN by adding NN gases to the atmosphere , but this is only part of the equation . NNP ’s NN can VB over NN not only because of NNS in the atmosphere but RB because of interactions between the atmosphere and various geologic , chemical , biological , and geographic factors . For example , regional climates ( as well as NNP ’s JJ NN ) can VB in response to a sustained period of heavy volcanic activity . Much of that activity is related in turn to the movement of NNP ’s tectonic plates , which drives the continents across the NN of the NN . Over hundreds of thousands to millions of NNS , the continents collide with other continents or break apart , changing the paths of ocean currents and local winds . This affects the transport of heat from the tropics to the poles . NNP ’s JJ NN has RB changed in response to drastic NNS in atmospheric chemistry — notably the rise in oxygen concentrations billions of NNS ago when plants , algae , and other forms of NN capable of photosynthesis began to spread across the NN . As the NN continues to come to grips with how JJ activities influence NNP ’s NN , the tangible effects of NN NN that is caused by JJ NN — such as melting glaciers and NN caps , rising NN levels , and NNS in seasonal NN and rainfall patterns — are becoming the focus . With such disruptions becoming more and more apparent , JJ NNS are discussing them increasingly in terms of real JJ - term climatic NNS rather than simply remarking about NNP ’s average NN . Consequently , NN NN can RB refer to the NN - and - effect relationship between JJ NN and NN NN . That is , it can refer to a NN in the average condition of the atmosphere brought on by JJ NN ."

With his JJ documentary “ 2040 , ” writer - director Damon Gameau set out to create a letter from the future , a self - described “ exercise in fact - VBN dreaming , ” for his 4 - NN - old daughter Velvet . His goal : present Velvet and her generation a positive path for battling NN NN utilizing only solutions that are presently available . Gameau initiated this vision of the future by asking 100 NNS from IN the NN what they MD VB 2040 to look IN . He was startled by how aware the kids ( ages 6 - 11 ) are of the challenges the NN is facing and weaves their voices into the film as an unjaded chorus of boundless potential ( “ Clean NN ! ” “ End deforestation ! ” “ Rocket boots ! ” “ National hot dog day ! ” ) . Turning to experts in various fields , Gameau learns about solar - powered microgrids , localized economies , electric self - driving cars , urban food farms , regenerative agriculture , marine permaculture , resource awareness and increased educational opportunities for girls ( perhaps the most surprising element presented ) . Every solution is then dramatized as to how it might affect the NN of a 20 - something Velvet . The effect is inspiring and empowering . Fanciful animation , graphics and special effects , abetted by Gameau ’s down under whimsy , make the film as entertaining as it is educational . Powered by unbridled optimism , Gameau defies skeptics by doing his homework and bringing receipts . Working on the film in 2019 , Gameau had no idea what 2020 MD look IN . Strangely or not , the massive uncertainty of the present only reenforces the pragmatic arguments of “ 2040 . ” The status quo is unsustainable , and Gameau illustrates that transformative NN is not only necessary , but possible ."

Democratic NNP NNP Rep.

But AOC seemingly blamed Republicans and their support for the fossil fuel industry for the reason behind the flooding . “ Unprecedented flooding is quickly becoming a JJ normal , ” she tweeted . “ Despite that , Republicans are tripling down on fossil fuels w/ no plan to transition off them , or make the critical infra investments we VBP to prep for the NN NN . ” “ NN NN intensifies flooding , wildfires , & extreme NN .

From now on she will VB to school on a bicycle , because driving her by car costs fuel , and fuel puts NNS into the atmosphere . Of course it will be winter soon and then she will VB to VB by bus , but cycling through the freezing builds resilience . Of course , she is now asking for an electric bicycle , but we have shown her the devastation caused to the areas of the NN as a result of mining for the extraction of Lithium and other minerals VBN to make batteries for electric bicycles , so she will be pedaling , or walking . Which will not harm her , or the NN . We VBD to cycle and walk to school too . Since the girl on TV demanded “ we VBP to VB rid of our dependency on fossil fuels ” and our daughter agreed with her , we have disconnected the heat vent in her room . The NN is now dropping to twelve degrees in the evening , and will drop below freezing in the winter , we have promised to buy her an extra sweater , hat , tights , gloves and a blanket . For the same reason we have decided that from now on she only takes a cold shower . She will wash her clothes by hand , with a wooden washboard , because the washing machine is simply a NN consumer and since the dryer uses natural gas , she will hang her clothes on the clothes line to dry , just IN my NNS and grandparents VBD to do . Speaking of clothes , the ones that she currently has are all synthetic , so made from petroleum . Therefore on Monday , we will bring all her designer clothing to the secondhand shop . We have VBN an eco store where the only clothing they sell is made from undyed and unbleached linen and jute . RB ca n’t have clothes made on wool , because the NNS from farting sheep are supposedly causing bad NN . It should n’t matter that it looks good on her , or that she is VBG to be laughed at , dressing in colorless , bland clothes and without a wireless bra , but that is the NN she has to pay for the benefit of The NNP . Cotton is out of the question , as it comes from distant lands and pesticides are VBN for it . Very bad for the environment . We just saw on her Instagram that she ’s pretty angry with us . This was not our intention . From now on , at 7 p.m. we will turn off the WiFi and we will only switch it on again the next day after dinner for CD hours . In this NN we will save on electricity , so she is not bothered by electro - stress and will be totally isolated from the outside NN . This NN , she can concentrate solely on her homework . At eleven o’clock in the evening we will pull the breaker to shut the NN off to her room , so she knows that dark is RB dark . That will save a lot of CO2 . She will no longer be participating in winter sports to ski lodges and resorts , nor will she be VBG on anymore vacations with us , because our vacation destinations are practically inaccessible by bicycle . Since our daughter fully agrees with the girl on TV that the CO2 NNS and footprints of her great - grandparents are to blame for ‘ killing our NN ’ , what all this simply means , is that she RB has to live IN her great - grandparents and they never had a holiday , a car or RB a bicycle . We have n’t talked about the NN footprint of food yet . Zero CO2 footprint means no meat , no fish and no poultry , but RB no meat substitutes that are VBN on soy ( after all , that grows in farmers fields , that use machinery to harvest the beans , trucks to transport to the processing plants , where more NN is VBN , then trucked to the packaging / canning plants , and trucked once again to the stores ) and RB no imported food , because that has a negative ecological effect . And absolutely no chocolate from Africa , no coffee from South NNP and no tea from Asia . Only homegrown potatoes , vegetables and fruit that have been grown in local cold soil , because greenhouses run on boilers , piped in CO2 and artificial light . Apparently , these things are RB bad for The NNP . We will teach her how to grow her own food . Bread is still possible , but butter , milk , cheese and yogurt , cottage cheese and cream come from cows and they emit CO2 . No more margarine and no oils will be VBN for the frying pan , because that fat is palm oil from plantations in Borneo where rain forests RB grew . No NN cream in the summer . No soft drinks and no NN drinks , as the bubbles are CO2 . We will RB ban all plastic , because it comes from chemical factories . Everything made of steel and aluminum must RB be removed . Have you ever seen the amount of NN a blast furnace consumes or an aluminum smelter ? All bad for the NN ! We will replace her memory foam pillow top mattress , with a jute bag filled with straw , with a horse hair pillow . And finally , she will no longer be VBG makeup , soap , shampoo , cream , lotion , conditioner , toothpaste and medication . Facewashers will all be linen , that she can wash by hand , with her wooden washboard , just IN her female ancestors did before NN NN made her angry at us for destroying her future . In this NN we will VB her to do her part to prevent mass extinction , NN levels rising and the disappearance of entire ecosystems . If she truly believes she wants to walk the talk of the girl on TV , she will gladly accept and happily embrace her JJ NN of NN . This article was posted : Wednesday , December 4 , 2019 at 5:24 am"

Prickly acacias edge the plot of land , protecting bone - dry soil from further erosion . Sghaier ’s father once grew olive and fruit trees — varieties that mostly shriveled and died under her watch . “ There has n’t been enough rain in recent NNS , ” VBZ the 52 - NN - old farmer . Her tiny farm in eastern Tunisia is a bellwether for the dramatic JJ NNS already reshaping North Africa , which threaten to intensify with NN NN . Sandwiched between an encroaching Sahara and a VBG Mediterranean NNP , the region has seen a sharp drop in rainfall over the past half century — a trend experts VBP will likely intensify in the coming decades . Indeed , over the course of this century parts of North Africa as well as the Middle East might become uninhabitable , according to the German research and policy organization , the Max Planck Institute . “ We ’re seeing higher NNS and increasing NN stress , ” VBZ Essia Guezzi , NN and NN project officer for conservation group WWF North Africa , summing up some of the regional challenges . Meanwhile , rising NN levels threaten the region ’s largely coastal populations , she and others note . These and other issues will come into sharp focus during next month ’s NN summit in Spain , a fellow member of the Mediterranean region that is considered a NN hotspot — more vulnerable to the effects of NN NN than other parts of the NN . While Morocco has earned praise as a NN - NN leader , the North African region overall needs to do much more to counter an otherwise grim future , experts VBP . RB hampering efforts : some NNS are buffeted by conflict and civil unrest , while fossil fuels continue to drive Algerian and Libyan economies . Trying to turn the tide In Tunisia , fresh groundwater reserves are shrinking rapidly . Roughly CD - thirds of the land is threatened by desertification . The effects of NN NN are likely to slow the country ’s growth , hitting CD major revenue drivers — tourism and agriculture — according to a 2018 report by the Netherlands Foreign Ministry . While Tunisian authorities have outlined ambitious targets — including cutting NNS 41 percent by 2030 compared to 2010 levels — they have been slow to match words with NN , critics VBP . Nor did the issue figure high on candidates ’ priorities in recent legislative and presidential elections . “ It seems IN the environment and the impact of NN NN is the last concern of JJ Tunisian politicians , ” VBZ Hamadi Gharbi , WWF North Africa NNP and NNP project manager , who VBZ the country RB needs more NN financing and expertise . In the village of Bir Salah , Sghaier is trying , at least locally , to turn the tide . She and other area farmers began planting hardy acacia trees to VB reduce erosion , along with moringa , a fast - growing plant prized for its nutritional and medicinal properties . The idea was to VB fight NN NN and earn a profit doing so . The reality has not been so easy . “ Everyone likes JJ NNS , ” Sghaier VBZ , showing a visitor her storeroom packed with moringa oils and powders , along with bags of moringa - VBN bsissa , a Tunisian breakfast drink , which a group of growers have made and packaged . “ The problem is selling them , ” she VBZ . “ It ’s hard to find a NN . ” Across the Sahara , the African Union has spearheaded an ambitious ‘ Great Green Wall ’ initiative aimed to restore degraded land across a swathe of the Sahel , while RB offering income - generating opportunities for communities living there . “ The goal is to replant trees , to return the Sahel to what it was about 60 NNS ago , when there was a lot more forest cover , ” VBZ anthropologist Gilles Boetsch , director of a French scientific team working with Senegalese researchers in the region . There are plenty of setbacks he VBZ . JJ trees die and VBP to be replaced , while conflict in some Sahel NNS makes areas inaccessible . “ It does n’t work 100 percent , but it works , ” Boetsch VBZ , adding a similar regional initiative MD RB work north of the Sahara . “ The JJ problem is NN . The second is getting communities to accept the projects . ” In North Africa , some national projects to fight NN NN are making a difference , and Tunisia will reportedly present a regional oases protection project at the Madrid NN conference . Local farmers in northern Algeria are getting Mexican expertise to plant prickly pear , a cactus that offers a raft of nutritional and NN - generating benefits and needs little rainfall . Algeria is RB trying to revive a massive ‘ Green Dam ’ reforestation project that previously had disappointing results . In Tunisia ’s southeastern Gabes region , Dhafer Guezguez worked with the local NN in European Union - financed projects that included restoring oases and reintroduce native date palm NNS . The plants are hardy and nutritious , he VBZ , but not as sweet as popular commercial varieties . Attracting consumers will VB serious marketing . “ They VBP to be showcased as a product that ’s rare and good for you , ” Guezguez VBZ . “ The same kind of effort we saw in Europe and the NNP NNPS to VB NNS to eat organic NNS . ” The oases preservation initiatives have helped to boost local economies and restore depleted soil , he VBZ . Women dominate the workforce . The projects have continued RB after EU financing ended . Participants are RB making tourist handicrafts IN palm leaf bags and hats , to earn extra revenue . “ I VBP this is how , little by little , we can save the oases , ” Guezguez VBZ . “ When local communities realize it ’s in their interest to do so ."

"" And she named the NN Ichabod . "" And her last testimony was - as she thought upon the ark of NNP being taken by the Philistines - "" The glory is departed from Israel . "" It was goodbye to glory ! "" Let us make some applications of that statement , RB though we MD appear as those who carve epitaphs on tombstones , or as those who write obituaries , or as those who wailingly and discordantly participate in funeral dirges . Though we MD be asking you to look through old windows upon scenes which others have described , though we MD travel some well - worn and familiar trails , though we MD serve the same food in somewhat JJ platters , still we make bold to ask you to remember that ' tis JJ ' . A Nation NNP Lose Its Glory The wife of Phinehas , passing through the swirling waters of the river of death , VBD : "" The glory is departed from Israel "" Thoughtfully scanning the pages of history , rubbing the dust of centuries off the tombs of some nations that underwent the frightful processes of self - burial , we can give the same testimonies concerning other nations . For 'tis JJ that , warmed by the NN which never loses its glory , a nation 's NN MD set in night . Under the stars - stars which never lose their splendor a nation 's starry crown MD lose its brightness , being displaced by a withered wreath of poison ivy or a circle of undesirable cactus , or by the brow becoming an eyeless , earless , tongueless , brainless skull . Beneath the heavens which declare the glory of NNP , RB as the firmament showeth His handiwork , a nation that circled the clouds as a strong - winged eagle , can flutter among the clouds as a broken - winged vulture or squawking parrot . Among the flowery continents of NNP a nation can become a place of foul odours that make the righteous stop their noses . [ Ancient Babylon ] Great was the glory of Babylon of old ; but Babylon became a vermin- infested , animal - prowling jungle - Babylon , "" the glory of kingdoms , the beauty of the Chaldees ' excellency , "" became "" as when NNP overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah . "" Something of the tragic departure of its glory is VBN in these words : "" It shall never be inhabited , neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation : neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there ; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there . But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there ; and their houses shall he full of doleful creatures ; and owls shall dwell there , and satyrs shall dance there . And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces : and her NN is near to come , and her days shall not be prolonged . "" - Isaiah 13:20 - 22 . [ Ancient Carthage ] Great was the glory of Carthage centuries ago . But her commanders became as impotent as skeletons of cattle scattered on desert sands . Her swift NNS became as a cripple 's walk - her clenched fist as the fumbling fingers of a paralytic . [ Ancient Syria ] Wondrous the glory of Syria at a NN when Eleanor 's troubadours at Antioch bewitched the Syrian air with ballads of the South - and lightened the horrors of the second crusade . But Syria 's glory departed when the following was VBN . "" But this NNS hath a revolting and a rebellious heart ; They are revolted and gone . "" - Jeremiah 5:23 . [ Ancient Greece ] Great was the glory of ancient Greece - especially from 450 B.C. to 350 B.C. - under Pericles . But Greece became a moulded crust in history 's garbage heap . Greece had her Athens -- civilization 's queen . Plato was hers . Socrates was hers . A vast multitude of seers was hers . Phidias , raising beautiful NNS unto Athens from the sterile womb of stone , marbled JJ places with sculptured wonders . The Muses tented in her NNS and plumed the arts with eagle 's wings . At JJ shrines the JJ brain bowed in reverence . But with all these persons , with all these things of beauty , Greece became a moulded crust in history 's garbage can . [ Ancient Rome ] Great the glory of the Rome of centuries far back and forever gone - especially from 50 B.C. to 60 A.D. - with her astute statesmen , with her close - meshed code of laws , with her sword - woven mantle , coin - embroidered , that fell on cities where merchants congregated and fattened on the spoils of trade , with her armies that feasted and fattened on NN . Rome was mighty among the kingdoms - mighty wherever ships and swords and thrones and lust of gold and sovereignty constituted the boasted heritage of the age . But Rome and her glory became as a mouth full of pyorrheic gums holding rotten teeth , all loose and foul . [ Ancient Nineveh ] Great the glory of the nation - JJ realm of Nineveh - with her winged lions symbolic of strength and speed . But Nineveh became as a vari-colored butterfly enmeshed and perishing in the net of a relentless spider . [ Ancient Egypt ] Great the glory of old ancient Egypt - the land of the Pharaohs - the land of wealth and wonders . But it became a shabby sexton of splendid tombs - her torch of far - reaching splendor became a pot of smoke without CD spark of remaining radiance . [ Ancient Spain ] Great was the glory of ancient Spain - back there in the glorious NNS beyond recall . Wide and strong was the sway of her scepter . Her piratical ships harassed all the seas and filled her coffers with gold . But this nation , with NN and conquests and caches of coin , with thrones and crowns and scepters , with laughter and love and lure , with men and NN and might , with fervor and force and fruit , became as a drowsy and lousy and frowsy beggar watching a broken clock . [ Ancient Jerusalem ] And let us ask you to VB of Jerusalem - "" beautiful for situation "" - as representative of the nation Israel . Triumphant were her temples . Her past "" shines glorious as doth the NN on midnight seas . "" For favoured Jerusalem , kings kneeled down and prayed . For glorious Jerusalem , prophets , in tears and love , served . For beautiful Jerusalem , martyrs shriveled into flame . In Jerusalem 's virgin face were eyes in which , deep - folded , lay prophecies of the Son of NNP . But because within her sacred courts evil was girt with diadem , Jerusalem hardened her heart . Jerusalem bloodied her hands . Jerusalem deafened her ears . Jerusalem played the harlot . And Jesus described her then departing and afterward utterly departed glory in these words , "" Thy NN is left unto thee desolate . "" Covered this NN - soaked NN with the wreck of once - glorious cities . Scarred the face of this NN - blighted NN with the ruin of once - glorious nations . Marred the fair face of this NN with the wreck of once - glorious civilizations - civilizations which have left behind them nothing but the smoke of the brilliant torch , nothing more than an empty name , nothing more than the shadow of a shadow . What the Bible VBZ about some nations and some cities - representatives in JJ measure of once - proud , once - strong , once - influential civilizations - is JJ of other nations and cities of the past and the present : "" For I have sworn by myself , saith the Lord , That Bozrah shall become a desolation , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes ... "" RB Edom shall be a desolation . every CD that goeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof ... "" And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons , and a desolation for ever ; there shall no NN abide there , nor any son of NN dwell in it . ""- Jeremiah 49:13,17,33 . "" This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly , That VBD in her heart , I am , and there is none beside me : how is she become a desolation , a place for beasts to lie down in ! every CD That passeth by her shall hiss , and wag his hand . "" - Zephaniah 2:15 . In NNP we must remember that the glory of a nation is righteousness and faith in NNP - and VBG the NN NNP points - and in such is our security against all foes , our immunity against the ravages of NN . "" For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish , yea , those nations shall be utterly wasted . "" - Isaiah 60:12 . This sober truth that only righteousness exalteth a nation -- that if ever NNP loses her faith in NNP she will have to come off her pedestal , that pallbearers that carried other nations to their graves will do work for us if we forsake NNP and refuse to VB the NN He points -- was put upon our hearts once by the editor of the Watchman - Examiner in these words : "" We should remember that CD hundred NNS ago Germany was regarded as the most Christian nation in Europe . Germany 's evangelicalism was once so pronounced that Martin Luther gave us the marvelous translation of the Scriptures and directed the NN to the Bible . The Scriptures so influenced the Home , the School , and the Church of Germany that the national NN saw a phenomenal progress . Germany was now making terrific strides in NN , art , and culture . Then came a day when innate conceit got to work . Christianity was emasculated . Christ was rationalized to be nothing more than a good NN . The Holy Scriptures were reduced to a crazy quilt . Religion came to be built on negatives . NNP was dwarfed and NN was deified . ' Let the strong survive , ' became the JJ religion . Germany was decivilized and Hitler had no trouble getting his followers to arm to the hilt to conquer the NN . "" Let us ask the NN of Almighty NNP in these days when men "" loose wild tongues that hold not NNP in awe , "" when there are evils that MD lead our greatest graces to the grave and leave the NN no copy . When the atheistic deformities of our times MD coerce us into substituting for Christianity 's vital bread a chunk of froth scattered by miasmatic winds - lest our country become a despised Ichabod among the nations of NN . A Church NNP Lose Her Glory "" Thy glory hath departed "" Too bad and too sad when that is spoken of a church about which glorious things once were spoken . ' Tis tragic , 'tis JJ that of some churches such is the epitaphic description of their decay , their inverted torch , their oil - less lamps , their turning back in the day of battle - though armed and carrying bows . That is grief for angels . That is laughter for devils . That is gloating for Satan . That is groaning for Christ 's followers . A church can "" leave its JJ love "" The church at Ephesus did - and needed to "" repent and do the JJ works "" Revelation 2:4,5 . A church can VB from an army into an ecclesiastical nursery wherein the preacher is looked upon as a head nurse who has more to do with milk bottles for sickly saints than with mighty battles against seductive Satan . Then does its glory depart . A church can VB from a church of compassionate concern into a church of callisthenic conventionality utterly devoid of devotional vitality - censorious of spiritual and far - sighted leadership , worldly , wayward , and peevishly puny . Then can Ichabod be written over its portals , its pews , its pulpit . A church can VB from a cataract of activity into a scum - covered pond of stagnation . Thus , forgetting that "" she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth , "" she hastens the departure of her glory . A church can VB from a church of aggressive conquest into a church possessive of a slothful timidity , a passive acquiescence in JJ attainments , a criminal spineless in the face of evils that arrogantly challenge , a careless in - difference to great stretches of the unattained . Thus is Ichabod an appropriate adjective for its activities and aimlessness . A church can be a roller of marbles when it should be a remover of mountains . Thus does its spiritual muscle become flabby , its fingers fumbling , its NNS halt - as the glory departs . A church can put its headlight on the rear and VB only of the glory that was . Then and thus does its light grow dim , its voice faltering , its spiritual ambitions anemic , its worship boresomely lacking in NN , its glory NN of the past . Pathetic the words that fell from the Master 's lips . "" And as he went out of the temple , CD of his disciples saith unto him , Master , VB what manner of stones and what buildings are here ! And Jesus answering VBD unto him , Seest thou these great buildings ? There shall not be left CD stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down "" Mark 13:1,2 . They were great buildings . They were magnificent stones . But to his eyes they were nothing more than ruins , for the glory of the temple 's worship and service had departed . "" But the Lord VBD unto Samuel , Look not on his countenance , or on the height of his stature ; because I have refused him : for the Lord seeth not as NN seeth ; for NN looketh on the outward appearance , but the Lord looketh on the heart "" - I Sam . 16:7 . Outwardly that beautiful and stately temple seemed destined to "" defy the tooth of NN . "" Inwardly it was hollow and empty and tottering to its fall . Write "" Ichabod "" upon it . Is it possible for a church , when NNP calls it to "" launch out into the deep "" in the matter of soul - winning , to become "" a drifting sepulcher manned by a frozen crew ? "" Well , when academic luster takes the place of spiritual passion , when refrigeration is valued above conflagration , such is the danger . I once heard Dr. Perry Webb VB : "" The atmosphere in some churches is so cold , you can skate down the aisles . "" Is it JJ that a church MD be noted for the gorgeous architecture of its building , the lovely music of its choir , the stateliness of its ritual , the fine - functioning of all its organizations , the largeness of numbers as to its congregation , the influence in JJ circles of business and JJ and educational NN - and yet be , in the eyes of Him who marks the sparrow 's fall , as a corpse wrapped in an ornate shroud ? Of the church at Sardis , Jesus , risen and enthroned , VBD : "" And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write , These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of NNP , and the seven stars ; I VBP thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead . "" - Revelation 3:1 . Somebody described another church IN unto the church at Sardis in these words : Outwardly splendid as of old - Inwardly sparkless , void and cold - Her force and fire all spent and gone - IN the dead NN she still shines on . R.T. Ketcham once VBD : "" Attend church , but do not attend a church which prefers NN to Scripture , reason for revelation , NNS for truth , culture for conversion , benevolence for NN , goodness for grace , sociability for spirituality , play for praise , pep for prayer , profession for possession , progress for NN , reformation for regeneration , good for NNP , speculation for salvation , jubilation for justification , feelings for faith , paralysis for peace , politics for precepts . "" To this I make additional comment saying that a church deserves to have Ichabod written from its lowest cellar step to the sky - touching point of its steeple which prefers the adulation of saints to ardent anxieties concerning lost sinners as well as abhorrence of that which is evil . Glory yields up its scepter - when the fancies of literary notables have place along with the facts of the gospel , when there is the frivolity of the flesh instead of the fervor of the spiritual in serving the Lord - godliness in form only instead of glorying in the cross of Christ - a groping after eternal verities - and a guessing that only borders on godliness as to the certainties of NNP 's promises instead of a guidance of others into paths of righteousness . Glory "" packs its baggage for a CD - NN trip "" when in the church NNS are noted for faultfinding instead of being notable for forgiveness - when offense is quickly taken and there is overlordism instead of the offering of self for lowly service - when the making of NN means more than the mastery of NN . How can the glory of the church be as a sunlit mountain whose position never VBZ when in the church there is playing at the job and little praying on the job - when peevishness and petulance predominate over praise - when there is quarrelsomeness instead of quietness - when there is frequent rumpus - raising and riotous revelry instead of restfulness , sinfulness instead of saintliness , selfishness instead of service , tattling instead of testimony , tampering with temptation instead of triumph over temptation . "" Thy glory hath departed "" will be written on NN and VBN in Heaven of the church where there is more yawning over watches than yearning over wanderers - where there is mere zest and not zealousness in good works . Let us so live and give , so love and serve , so watch and pray , that , if the individual 's conduct were universalized , it MD never be as a hand that writes of a church , "" Thy glory hath departed . "" The JJ glory of a church consists : "" in the purity of its members ; in its spiritual progress ; in the unity of its fellowship ; in the spiritual NNS born into its household of faith ; in its self - sacrificing spirit toward others ; and in the prayer NN of the whole group . When a church is in a healthy condition hypocrisy will be limited ; progress in purity will be constant ; strife and discord will disappear ; sympathy for the lost will seek means for their rescue ; recruits will outnumber the losses from backsliding , removal , and death ; private devotion will be a pleasure , family religion a joy , and JJ worship a sought delight . "" Along with this let us remember that any church will undergo the frightful processes of dishonorable self - burial where there is a lax theology that advocates a mutilated Bible , a minimized sin , a deified NN , a humanized Christ - substituting JJ opinions and speculations for the revealed pronouncements of NNP concerning the Bible , concerning the nature of men , concerning the terrors of sin , concerning the deity of Christ , concerning the meaning of Christ 's death on the cross , concerning the plan of salvation , concerning Hell , concerning Heaven . A Home MD Lose Its Glory Yet , glorious as the glory of a real home is , the glory can depart - sometimes does depart - assuredly will depart - if the things "" down under "" Christian ideals , sordidly below Christian standards for a home - VB the upper hand and put their oppressive heels upon the virtues which MD weave wedding garments instead of shrouds on the home loom . Answer these questions : Are there not JJ homes that are polluted reservoirs from which muddy streams that carry deadly contamination flow ? Are there not JJ homes that are grindstones on which the Devil sharpens his weapons of wickedness ? The glory of a home departs when NNS walk on the edges of mental abysses - talking nonsense . The glory of a home will assuredly leave a home as a flower wilts under heavy frost - when NNS , by neglect or omission in spiritual matters , send NNS out to NN in paper boats , as though seas did not drown , - when NNS , in matters momentous as to issue in stainlessness of morals , permit NNS , in daring defiance of Christian conduct , to walk bare - footed on live coals , as though fire did not burn . Today so JJ homes die in houses . Today JJ who VBP better , living for things that matter least , neglecting things that matter most , are JJ with houses in which there are no homes . In pioneer days , wolves often attacked NNS . In remote mountain districts eagles did the same . Out West Indians attempted to destroy the home of settlers . On battlefields vultures have eaten the sons of women . Now vultures of evil literature attack our NNS . Now poisonous serpents are in every pathway they tread . Now the jackals of sex familiarity are fed by precept and example . Now the leaping leopards of lust ; Now the vultures of infidelity in ministry and press ; Now barnyard morality ; Now demagogues who ravage the land ; Now the buzzards of liquor traffic on every corner - permitted there by the NNP NNPS NNP ; Now the NN of evolution in most schools - evolution , the antithesis of Christianity ; Now modernism choosing the livery of Heaven to serve the Devil in ; Now godless scholarship summoning the Bible to appear at the bar of JJ reason ; Now all these infest our land . All of which is to VB that - no explorer amid the wilds of the North , no adventurer amid unexplored jungles , no NN amid deadly contagions of NN - ever had to face as JJ dangers as our NNS of today face : their morals , their spiritual welfare , their mental wealth , their soul 's salvation considered . Parental delinquency makes glory depart from a home . Are we unfair to VB that behind every delinquent NN is a delinquent parent ? Are we ceasing to tell the truth when we VBP that behind every broken youth is a broken home ? Do we not speak words of truth when we VBP that behind every broken home is a neglect of NNP in that home ? When a fifteen - NN - old unmarried girl , pregnant with NN , stands before the NN and VBZ that she does not consider she has done wrong - no more than thousands of other young girls are doing - where are the mothers ? When a fourteen - NN - old boy , apprehended for roaming the streets of a city at early morning hours , stands before the NN with tears in his eyes and asks to be sent to the NN school - because he knows he MD be happier there than in his own home - where is the father ? When young girls smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and dress so skimpily they attract the attention of every goggle - eyed NN and boy - do not their mothers the same ? When boys argue over the relative "" values "" and "" quick - stirring "" powers of advertised brands of liquor - do not their fathers drink booze and vote for legalizing it , forgetting that you can VB a powder can in a fire as easily as you can VB booze ? Is there not too much laxness on the part of NNS toward spiritual values ? Often NNS are allowed to stay out of Sunday School and to miss church services - to remain in almost complete ignorance of the spiritual values . Is it not perilous to NNS , this easy - come , easy - VB attitude of NNS ? Is not the use of intoxicating beverages CD of the greatest evils responsible for juvenile delinquency ? Are not NNS from homes where indiscriminate drinking is done sent out to "" play the game "" with CD strikes against them ? Do not thinking NNS VB that youth delinquency MD be negligible if it were not for delinquent adults , especially delinquent NNS ? Can CD pass judgment on these young NNS without indictment of ourselves for failure somewhere down the line ? Do not boys and girls VB into trouble when too much leisure NN is theirs ? Are not city governments extremely unwise to VB they have no NN for further improvement of playgrounds while they allot JJ sums of taxpayers ' NN for the cost of punishing the youth for committing crimes ? Is it not shortsightedness bordering on imbecility to pay so much for the cost of juvenile delinquency and so little for its prevention ? "" Any law should be so framed to penalize the delinquent parent as well as the delinquent NN . . . We must RB give NNP his rightful place in the JJ home ... Until the cardinal principles of NNP are implanted in the hearts of the youth of our nation ... until there is instilled in the hearts of the NNS of these youth a NNP - JJ sense of responsibility in that home , we shall continue to experience wave upon wave of crime , mounting and growing steadily day by day , until it reaches a magnitude beyond the scope of the law - enforcement agencies and the JJ NNS to VB . "" But if NNS distinguish themselves by the profession of truth , the worship of NNP , the practice of virtue , they will be sure to draw others after them ; whereas if they are irreligious and un-Christian , they are infested fountains that poison . NNS can no more dispense with personal piety without malicious influence on NNS than a tree can dispense with sap and bear fruit . Adam and Eve sinned ! And Cain became a murderer . Had they not sinned , Abel MD have lived . If a rock is a quotation from the quarry , if a flower is a quotation from the garden , if a tree is a quotation from the forest , if a bird is a quotation from the flock , if every NN is a quotation of his NNS - what sort do the NNS make you ? Today the situation is desperate . Character is at a premium in the land . Criminality of all kinds is rampant . The daily prints are filled with record of deeds almost too revolting for JJ consumption . An ever - rising wave of lawlessness is hurling its weight against the bulwarks of the nation . Much of this is because of godless homes - because too JJ fathers and mothers have abdicated . How NNS ought to rejoice for the opportunity of living close to NNP , of hearing the motion of angel 's wings in the patter of little NNS , and of being Christlike in the home . Glory in a home is made secure when Christian conduct is evident . Unless you serve NNP yourselves as NNS you will plant vines on which will grow grapes of bitterness . "" What mean ye , that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the NNS 's teeth are set on edge ? "" Ezekiel 18:2 Nothing is so infectious as example : "" We can do more good by being good than in any other NN "" ( Kingsley ) . "" A father who whipped his son for swearing and swore while he whipped him , did more harm by his example than good by his correction "" ( Fuller ) . "" Noble examples stir us up to noble actions "" ( Burke ) . "" Live with wolves and you will learn to howl . "" A drinking or drunken father is a poor preacher of sobriety to sons . A proud father is a miserable recommender of humility to sons . They will do as you do rather than as you VBP . Your example will counteract all the effect of your counsel - and all the convictions you MD fix in the NN will fall IN arrows from an impenetrable shield . You should therefore begin "" both to do and to teach . "" You should be able , in a humble measure , at least , to VB to those under your care : "" Be ye followers of me , RB as I RB am of Christ ... "" "" Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? Thou that preachest a NN should not steal , dost thou steal ? Thou that sayest a NN should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? Thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ? Thou that makest thy boast of the law , through breaking the law dishonourest thou NNP ? "" Romans 2:21 - 23 If NNS suffered their NNS to VB naked , to beg their bread , to lie unattended in sickness , to perish with hunger in a ditch , they MD be shunned as monsters . But NNS act a far more criminal and a far more infamous part by disregarding their spiritual and everlasting welfare . Doubtless Herod , after killing the infants in Bethlehem , was viewed and shunned with horror . But he was far less cruel than some modern NNS . He only destroyed the body . "" But it any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own NN , be hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel . "" I Timothy 5:8 . Let us remember and teach others to remember - lest glory depart from our dwellings - that there is a difference in a NN and a home : that a NN is built by JJ hands but a home is built by JJ hearts , that a NN is built of visible materials but a home is built of the invisible things of the Spirit ; that a NN MD be destroyed , but fire and flood and earthquake and storm can not destroy a real home ; that there is only CD calamity can ruin a home , the death of love ; that the real food of a home is not meat and bread but thoughtfulness and unselfishness . The basis for Christianity in the home , the preventative of departed glory , is Jesus and the church . Can there be a real Christian home without union with the church ? Can there be Christian homes without churchgoing as a habit as well as a duty and a privilege ? Jesus had the habit of churchgoing , for 'tis written : "" He was in the synagogue as was his custom on the Sabbath day . "" When I was a boy it was as natural to VB to church on Sunday as it was to work on Monday or to play games on Saturday afternoon , but the present idea is that it is a terrible thing , a NN of mental and physical punishment . Dr. Macartney tells how when Grover Cleveland lay dying at Princeton , his NN reverted , not to any of the fierce JJ battles through which he had passed , nor to the presidential honors and burdens which he had borne , but to the old home in the Presbyterian manse , where his minister father at family worship prayed for the eternal salvation of his NNS . The dying NN asked that a copy of the hymnbook out of which they VBD to sing be procured , so that with its music and its memories he might face the eternal NN . And then this great preacher VBZ : "" All kinds of doctors are abroad today with all kinds of remedies for our national and JJ diseases . But a filled family pew in NNP 's NN on the Lord 's day is the best thing that can ever happen to a family , a city , or a nation . "" An Individual NNP Lose the Glory It is possible for an individual so to live that it can be VBN in NN and declared in Heaven : "" Thy glory has departed "" - as light departs from a lamp in which there is no oil , as fruitfulness departs from a tree wherein is no sap . The old poet must have had some experience of this truth when he wrote : I remember , I remember , But now 'tis little joy To VB I 'm farther off from Heaven Than when I was a boy . What tragedy when "" Ichabod "" - "" Thy glory hath departed "" - is written above and over a once - believing heart ! What sorrow sufficient to make angels weep - when "" thy - glory - hath - departed "" is the autobiography of a NN once faithful , once loyal , once devoted . What NN for grief when the NN once a NN of unselfish service becomes a NN of stagnant selfishness - a NN that centers in self . What tragedy for NN and NN and NNP when the NN once possessed of the fruit of the Spirit - "" love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , meekness , goodness , faith , self - NN "" - is now a NN in which is manifest the works of the flesh - "" adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness , idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies , envying , murders , drunkenness , reveling , and such JJ . "" Yet that you VBP , that you find , in the lives of some individuals who have gone from us - and in the lives of some who now live in our midst . So JJ who call themselves Christians have lost the old - NN glow . With them the sacred fervor of other NNS is lacking . Men and women there are who once believed in prayer and believed that we forfeit peace and bear needless NN because we do not carry everything to NNP in prayer ; but now they are prayerless altogether or are weak in prayer and look upon it as a useless exercise . NNS I VBP who , when they were young , believed the Bible to be the Word of NNP - infinite in scope , infallible in authority , regenerative in NN , personal in application - who now VBP that it is a book of myths and allegories . Of them 'tis tragically JJ they have hewn themselves cisterns where no NN is and have forsaken the fountain of living waters . I VBP young NNS who have attended schools that once , in the days of our forefathers , were bulwarks for the most holy faith . Entering these schools they were believers in the miraculous and the supernatural , but now , deceived by the evil seducers who wooed and won them with strange and fantastic myths , they are adrift - without chart or compass . From them the glory hath departed , RB as it had departed from schools which serve the Devil in the livery of Heaven . Instead of believing the certainties of NNP 's Word , they put their trust in the unscriptural surmises of men . Instead of feeding on NNP 's Word , they have grown lean on the diet of quips given them by those who , calling themselves scholarly teachers , plant "" probabilities "" and "" perhapses "" and "" maybes "" or "" not - at - alls "" in the minds of youth . Thus has glory departed from the teachers and from the taught . Thus has glory departed from the schools in which these teachers teach . The students so taught and the teachers who , IN vandals , break into the NN of their faith should realize that NN 's wisdom is to be laughed at . How glory departs from an individual , or a multitude of individuals when they depart from the teaching of the supernaturalistic school , championed by orthodox Christians contending that Christ is the God-man - to line up with the materialistic school , championed by evolutionists . VB of Judas - the incarnation of infamy today ! Shakespeare called him "" the base Judean who sold a pearl richer than all his tribe . "" Judas , given a great opportunity by Christ Himself , had part of "" the ministry and apostleship on which angels longed to serve . "" Did not this position place its participant on a level with Moses and Elijah ? But the glory of this individual began to grow dim when he began to wonder about the course that Jesus chose in refusing the kingship and in antagonizing the rulers . The glory grew RB dimmer when he began to worry about the future - and dimmer still when he began to pilfer the bag . And his glory departed completely when he went out into the night to bargain to betray Jesus for the NN of a hog ! Truly over it all you can write : "" Thy glory hath departed . "" And VB of Lot - called just and righteous . "" And delivered just Lot , vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked ( for that righteous NN dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day , with their unlawful deeds . ) "" He was driven to Egypt when famine came , yet his soul in JJ ways became a famished soul . A businessman , an opportunist , maker of a bad choice that he thought was a good choice . He certainly added no brightness to manhood 's torch by marrying a woman of Sodom - the wickedest city mentioned in NN 's literature , hopelessly corrupt . Lot escaped with only his family when NNP burned Sodom to the ground . Lot 's last act was CD of incest . From his daughters came the nations of Ammon and Moab . And VB of Saul - JJ king of Israel . His glory , which was as a burning bush of splendor , faded into lusterless cold ashes . Let us VB what the Scriptures tell us : "" And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Melchishua , Saul 's sons . And the battle went sore against Saul , and the archers hit him ; and he was sore wounded of the archers . Then VBD Saul unto his Armour bearer , Draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me . But his Armour bearer MD not ; for he was sore afraid . Therefore Saul took a sword , and fell upon it "" I Samuel 31:2 - 4 . Again and again , with tragic repetition , do the pages of history testify that individuals who once gave light as steady stars came to the NN and place where their light was the flame of a fluttering candle . In our churches we VBP NNS who once served faithfully who proved their kinship with Demas - to the hurt of some and to the sorrow of JJ . In some homes we have those who once held as sacred the marital vow who have gone as wild as the winds which VBP no barriers in making these vows perjury . ' Tis JJ that JJ VBP not , or , if knowing , give no heed to the truth that to leave Jesus out of NN is to VB good - by to glory . Against all things and against all evils that bring NNS to the place and NN where they VBP good - by to glory , I MD that all men MD take an unwavering stand remembering NNP 's promise : "" And they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee ; for I am with thee , saith the Lord , to deliver thee .

Ecuador set a NN record in 2017 for planting a whopping 647,250 trees in a single day . RB in 2017 , more than 1.5 CD volunteers came together to plant 66 CD trees in just 12 hours , setting another NN record . • WWF : NNP Has Lost 50 % of its Wildlife in the Past 40 NNS Now , NNP is reporting that in the findings of a 20 - NN NN of the NN , there are actually more trees today than there were CD decades ago , thanks in JJ part to the efforts of NNS and communities in India and NNP . The findings are the result of 20 NNS of NN collection from NNP instruments onboard CD satellites orbiting NN . A more detailed explanation from the NN : “ Satellite NNS show increasing leaf area of vegetation due to direct factors ( JJ land - use management ) and indirect factors ( such as NN NN , CO2 fertilization , nitrogen deposition and recovery from natural disturbances ) . Among these , NN NN and CO2 fertilization effects seem to be the dominant drivers . However , recent satellite NNS ( 2000 – 2017 ) reveal a greening pattern that is strikingly prominent in NNP and India and overlaps with croplands NN - wide . NNP alone accounts for 25 % of the JJ net increase in leaf area with only 6.6 % of JJ vegetated area . The greening in NNP is from forests ( 42 % ) and croplands ( 32 % ) , but in India is mostly from croplands ( 82 % ) with minor contribution from forests ( 4.4 % ) . “ [ Source ] Furthermore , the NN serves as a positive counter to the trend of pollution and JJ degradation we VBP today in Asia : The satellites have recorded photos of the NN every day for 20 NNS , creating a massive NN set that is allowing researchers and biologists to better understand how to preserve the NN ’s forests . “ This JJ - term NNS lets us dig deeper , ” VBD Rama Nemani , a research scientist at NNP ’s Ames Research Center and a co-author of the JJ work . “ When the greening of the NNP was RB observed , we thought it was due to a warmer , wetter NN and fertilization from the added NN dioxide in the atmosphere , leading to more leaf growth in northern forests , for instance . Now , with the MODIS NNS that lets us understand the phenomenon at RB JJ scales , we VBP that NNS are RB contributing . ” The message is clear : if we come together we can easily remedy the ecological problems we have created here on NN . Let this good NN serve as an inspiration to participate in the re-greening of NN . It RB demonstrates how NNS can address serious problems once they become aware of what ’s RB VBG on .

In 2018 , NNS and leaders from across the NN published a report showing how a 1.5 °C increase in JJ NNS from pre-industrial levels is devastating our environment . We are facing more extreme NN , food shortages , rising NN levels and mass extinction of plants and animals , to name a few impacts . The report below explains the undeniable link between JJ activities and this NN increase . The report RB calls for drastic NNS in policy to prevent further damage to our environment . Read the special report ' JJ NN of 1.5 ºC ' IPCC on the IPCC website . In response , our NN has recommended a ‘ net zero ’ target for NN gases . CO2 ( NN dioxide ) is the main gas produced by JJ activities . Find out more on the causes of NN NN on the European Commission website . Our NN recognises that , to reduce CO2 and other NN gas NNS , we all VBP to VB . The good thing is we already have the answers we VBP to tackle NN NN and JJ degradation . All it takes is the will to act now . Across the NN the impacts of NN NN are being felt in various ways . In some NNS , we are seeing shifting NN patterns that threaten food production . Elsewhere , rapid glacier melt threatens NN level rise that risks catastrophic flooding . Currently the impacts of NN NN are worse in poorer NNS . Nonetheless , it is likely that NN NN will increasingly affect the UK in NNS to come . Impacts it is likely we will VB include : • Very cold winters will be rare . • Winters will be wetter and summers will be hotter and more prolonged . • NN level MD rise by 40 cm , leading to coastal erosion and flood risks . • NN increase will VB the crops we grow , impacting our diets . • NNS in NN will VB JJ illnesses , creating more problems for NNS and the elderly . • Foreign diseases associated with hot NN migrating north , for example , Malaria . • Cost of living to increase due to food , fuel and NN shortages . • Homes potentially damaged and insurance will increase due to severe NN . • Domestic crops will begin to struggle due to NN NN . • Soil will be less fertile as we struggle to grow crops that no longer thrive . • Some NNS cannot adapt to NNS . • The plants and trees that can grow will VB . • Dubbed as the “ evil twin of NN NN "" . • The ongoing decrease in ocean pH , 30 % decrease so far . • Predicted 150 % by 2100 which has not been experienced for 400,000 NNS . • Wide implications for ocean NN , particularly animals with shells or skeletons . While NN NN is JJ in scale , Eden is no stranger to the impacts . The 2005 , 2009 and CD floods had damaging impacts across the district . We have suffered JJ , JJ and JJ losses . It is predicted similar flooding MD become more common as NNS increase . In December 2015 , Storm Desmond caused disruptions across Eden and Cumbria . It impacted homes and businesses for months after the event . The NNP NNP Act of 2008 was passed by our NN to ensure that we keep NN gas NNS at least 80 % lower than the 1990 baseline by 2050 , to avoid dangerous NN NN . The Act made the UK the JJ country with a legally binding framework to cut NN NNS . Alongside this Act , the Committee on NNP NNP was set up to advise the NN on legislation and progress on reducing NNS . The UK has struggled to meet NN targets set in this act , RB though the NN is getting stronger . NN NN effects are being experienced in our country , which we now must adapt to . Our experience of NN NN has already created costs to our economy , society and environment . We must work to mitigate against NN NN , as well as adapt to the impacts that we already experience . Mitigation : reducing NN NN Reducing NN gas NNS : NN efficiency , renewable NN , lower consumption rates , electric cars . Enhancing our NN sinks : planting trees and NN sequestering plants , invest in NN capture technology . NN : adapting to NN with NN NN Reduce our vulnerability to harmful effects . Innovation ( infrastructure IN flood defences / devices IN NN desalination / resilient food / efficient healthcare ) . Emergency planning for severe NN .

With non -stop coverage of the latest doomsday doyenne the powers - who - should - not - be have strutted out on the stage , it ’s easy to forget just how JJ times dire warnings have been issued about how the NNP ’s NN was on the verge of wiping out all NN on the NN . For those of you fed up with the grating gyrations of Greta Thunberg ( the troubled teenager being VBN by NN - VB Chicken Little leftists IN George Soros and NNP NNP ) , here are some nasty little facts the NN - run NN MD love to keep under wraps . A few months after The Wizard of Oz had its theatrical premiere in Green Bay , Wisc. in 1939 , a newspaper headline appeared as follows : “ Greenland ’s Glaciers Melting , NNP Scientist . ” “ All the glaciers in Eastern Greenland are rapidly melting , declared Prof. Hans Ahlmann , Swedish geologist , ” the article screamed . “ It MD without exaggeration be VBN that the glaciers , IN those in Norway , face the possibility of a catastrophic collapse , ” Ahlmann crowed . They just love that word catastrophe , do n’t they ? Seven - and - a- half NNS later , Ahlmann — feted and touted by those much smarter than us — was at it again , issuing his dire warnings : “ The possibility of a prodigious rise in the NN of the ocean with resultant widespread inundation , arising from an Arctic NN phenomenon was discussed yesterday by Dr. Hans Ahlmann , a noted Swedish geophysicist at the NNP of California Geophysical Institute . A mysterious NN of the NN was slowly manifesting itself in the Arctic , ” stated Ahlmann , who warned that “ oceanic surfaces MD rise to catastrophic proportions and NNS living in the [ Greenland ] lowlands . . . MD be inundated . ” It ’s no mystery , Hans ; it ’s nature . “ Polar NN Thaw Increasing : Glaciers VBD To Be Melting , ” VBD the headline . This NN , Arctic expert Dr. William S. Carlson VBD that “ the Polar icecaps were melting at an astonishing and unexplained rate and were threatening to swamp seaports by raising the ocean levels . ” We ’re still waiting , NNP . Arctic explorer Adm. Donald McMillan was next to warn , stating , “ There are now 6 CD square NNS of NN in the Arctic . There once were 12 CD square NNS . ” Perhaps realizing their dire predictions were not panning out , the “ experts ” were no longer warning of JJ NN , but had switched to JJ cooling , and a coming NN age ! You ca n’t make this stuff up . The next expert trotted out was James P. Lodge Jr. , a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research . In an article titled “ Scientist Predicts a NNP NNP Age by 21st century , ” Lodge warned that “ [ a ] ir pollution MD obliterate the NNP and VB a JJ NN age in the JJ third of the JJ century . ” Uh , Jim , can you pass me those sunglasses ? Things were so dire in the 1970s that CD of the nation ’s top geologists VBD it necessary to alert NNP Richard Nixon of the impending doom . “ [ A ] JJ deterioration of NN , by order of magnitude larger than any hitherto experienced by civilized mankind , is a very real possibility and indeed MD be due very soon . The present rate of cooling , ” they warned , “ seems fast enough to bring glacial NNS in about a century , if continuing at the present pace . ” By now , most of the JJ NN NN was on the bandwagon , running story after story on predictions of the coming NN age . “ An international team of specialists has concluded from eight indexes of NN that there is no end in sight to the cooling trend of the last 30 NNS , at least in the Northern Hemisphere , ” squawked the nation ’s “ newspaper of record . ” The following NN , “ The Gray Lady ” reversed course , predicting an Arctic meltdown , “ blaming JJ NN caused by NN dioxide NNS . . . . There is a real possibility that some NNS now in their infancy will live to a NN when the NN at the North Pole will have melted , a NN that MD VB swift and perhaps catastrophic NNS in NN . ” There ’s that word “ catastrophic ’ again . Not yet synched to spew identical nonsense , the Chicago Tribune still thought JJ cooling was the NN to VB , and “ reported ” some more unfounded , dire warnings about a freezing NN . Toward the end of the 1980s , however , the JJ NN playbook was adopted by all in the JJ NN NN , who have been constantly predicting polar icecap “ melting on a catastrophic scale . ” And of course , our good friends in the JJ NN NN MD never put the below in their fine papers or networks : In a Sept. 24 , Breitbart NNP Network headline , “ 500 NNS Write UN : ‘ There Is No NN Emergency , ’ ” the only NN platform with some heft reported on the letter sent from the oft - overlooked “ NNS and professionals in NN and related fields ” to the NNP Nations , “ asking for a JJ - overdue , high - level , open debate on NN NN . ” The CD - page letter should have been splattered across the pages and screens of all the major NN , but here ’s why it was n’t , as revealed by its main points : • There is no NN emergency . • NN is far slower than predicted . • CO2 is plant food , the basis of all NN on NNP . • Natural as well as anthropogenic factors VBP NN of the NNP . A wise NN once VBD , “ If you tell a lie JJ enough and keep repeating it , NNS will eventually come to VB it . ” Another wise NN once VBD , “ Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own CD . ” Thank NNP there are honest alternative NN outlets IN NNP Free Press still publishing the truth about contentious topics . Dave Gahary , a JJ submariner in the U.S. Navy , prevailed in a suit brought by the NNP NNP NNP Exchange in an attempt to silence him . Dave is the producer of an upcoming full - length feature film about the attack on the USS Liberty .

""_''","JJ sport faces major disruption from NN NN in coming decades , according to a JJ analysis . By 2050 , it 's estimated that almost CD in four English football NN grounds can expect flooding every NN . But tennis , rugby , athletics and winter sports will RB face serious challenges from the impacts of rising NNS , the author VBZ . The NN finds that sports leaders are , in the main , failing to address the issue seriously . While the NNP - CD NN has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of JJ NN , JJ experts VBP that this is just a dress rehearsal for the JJ - term impacts on sport of a NN that 's RB too hot . Extreme NN events , related to rising NNS , have already disrupted some of the NN 's most high - profile sports in recent NNS . A typhoon , which wreaked havoc in Japan last NN , RB affected fixtures at the Rugby Union NNP being held there . Smoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this NN . These and JJ other instances are a foretaste of the future , according to this JJ NN compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt . As football slowly recovers from the NN NN , his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football NN clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050 . In the current Premier NNP , the home grounds of Southampton , Norwich , Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat . Cricket faces huge challenges globally as NNS rise in places IN India , Australia and the West Indies . Venues in Adelaide and Perth will VB a 60 % increase in days with NNS over 40C over the next decade . In golf , CD in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels , the report VBZ . Researchers VBP that of the CD venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics , just CD will be able to hold them by 2050 . But as well as showing the likely impacts of NN NN on sports , the JJ NN RB looks at the contribution that the sporting industry makes to NN NNS . The author VBZ that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country IN Bolivia at the low end but as JJ as a country IN Spain on the high end . The estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the JJ sportswear and sports broadcasting industries , who have impacts on NN that are difficult to calculate . Whatever the size of its NN footprint , the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect NN , VBZ the author . "" Sport MD be just JJ enough to register , in terms of NN NNS , as a JJ nation NN , or a single megacity , but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the NN total , "" VBD David Goldblatt . "" Making a NN zero NN the common sense priority of the sports NN MD make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics , "" he VBD . While some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN NN plan to make sport NN neutral by 2050 , the majority of sports authorities have not . The International Cricket Council is CD of those who have not signed up . Among winter sports , only the NN hockey and skiing federations have joined , "" which makes CD wonder what the NNS in charge of luge and bobsleigh VBP they are VBG to be sliding on in the future , "" the report waspishly notes . The report was commissioned by the Rapid Transition Alliance , a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to NN NN . "" A JJ step MD be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel NNS and NNS promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles , "" VBD Andrew Simms from the group . "" If players RB speak out and VBP they VBP clean air and a stable NN matter , millions more will VB the possibilities for NN . It will not only send a message of hope for the wider NN , but it will VB to guarantee a NN that is safe for sport . """

A lawsuit filed by 16 Alaska youths claimed JJ - term effects of NN NN will devastate the country 's northernmost NN and interfere with their constitutional rights to NN , liberty and JJ trust resources that sustain them . The NN 's legislative and executive branches have not taken steps to lower NN gas NNS and adopted a policy that promotes putting more in the air , VBD attorney Andrew Welle of the Oregon - VBN Our NNP 's Trust group . "" This is an issue that is squarely within the NN 's authority , "" Welle VBD . Assistant Attorney General Anna Jay urged justices to affirm a lower NN ruling rejecting the claims . Ultimately , the NN NN issues raised by Alaska youth must be addressed by the JJ branches of NN , she VBD . "" The NN does not have the tools to engage in the type of legislative policy making endeavor required to formulate a broad NN approach to NN gas NNS , "" she VBD . The 16 youths sued in 2017 and claimed damages by NN gas NNS are causing widespread damage in Alaska . The lawsuit VBD the NN has experienced dangerously high NNS , changed rain and snow patterns , rising seas , storm surge flooding , thawed permafrost , coastal erosion , violent storms and increased wildfires . Our NNS 's Trust is a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting natural systems for present and future generations . The group in 2011 unsuccessfully sued the NN in 2011 , claiming the NN failed to adopt measures to protect young NNS from NN NN . The judge in that NN concluded that courts lack scientific , JJ and technological resources that agencies can use to determine NN policy and it was best left in their hands . Alaska has no NN NNS or income tax and historically has relied on the petroleum industry , which extracts crude oil and sends most of it to West Coast Refineries , for much of its revenue . Welle VBD NN policy promoting fossil fuels , expressed in a NN statute , should be declared unconstitutional because it harms young Alaskans by trading short - term financial gains for JJ - term NN problems . The lead client in the NN , Esau Sinnok , has had his constitutional NN to NN and happiness denied by NN policy and lack of NN on NN NN , Welle VBD . "" His home village of Shishmaref is literally wiped off the map because of NN NN , "" Welle VBD before the hearing . "" It 's endangering his culture , the very existence of his community , the NN and safety of him and his community members . "" Justice Peter Maassen asked Welle if the NN policy was balanced by other policies in NN law , such as protection for natural resources and the environment . "" How can we conclude that NN agencies are following the NN policy blindly without consideration of these other policies ? "" Maassen asked . Welle VBD that while statutes provide authority to protect the environment , NN agencies have been directed to systemically promote fossil fuels . Justice Susan Carney called Welle 's attention to a newspaper opinion piece by JJ Gov. NNP Walker in which he acknowledged severe JJ effects of NN NN . "" Is n't that a sign that NN policy has balanced those concerns ? "" she asked . Welle replied that the NN when assessing NN policies , and their effects on fundamental constitutional rights , can assess the process , look at decisions and decide if balance struck is the most narrowly tailored choice . This story has been corrected to VB that 16 Alaska youths in 2017 sued the NN ."

In a JJ NN , an international group of researchers analyzed fossil records to track how the NN ’s vegetation changed as NNP climbed out of the last NN age thousands of NNS ago . Then , the NNS VBD their NNS to predict how vegetation in the future — and everything dependent on it — will RB VB . [ 6 Unexpected Effects of NNP NNP ] The NN is headed into uncharted territory , with "" no analog conditions "" in terms of NN , VBD NN co-author Jonathan Overpeck , the dean of the School for Environment and Sustainability at the NNP of Michigan . "" It makes it a lot harder for us to be sure what 's VBG to happen next . "" The fossil records show that the NN is very sensitive to NN NNS , which suggests that if fossil fuel NNS continue unabated , accelerated NN MD lead to dramatic transformations in vegetation and ecosystems IN the globe , the team wrote today ( Aug. 30 ) in the journal NNP . Subsequently , that NN MD lead to NNS in the amount of NN that plants can store , the available NN supply and the JJ biodiversity that we depend on not only for a healthy , functioning ecosystem , but RB for medicine , food and building materials , Overpeck VBD Live NNP . From the peak of the last NN age , 21,000 NNS ago , to the early Holocene epoch — the current geological age — the NN warmed by RB 4 to 7 degrees Celsius ( 7 to 13 degrees Fahrenheit ) . If NN gases are n't substantially reduced , the magnitude of NN that occurred over the course of 11,000 NNS following the end of the NN age will happen over a much shorter period : 100 to 150 NNS . To decipher how plant NN changed in the past , the researchers analyzed ancient pollen and plant fossils from nearly 600 sites on every continent except Antarctica . The investigators divided the NNS they observed into CD categories : compositional NNS , or NNS in plant NNS in the area , and JJ structural NNS , IN a tundra becoming a forest or a deciduous forest becoming an evergreen forest . The various NNS were classified as "" JJ , "" "" moderate "" or "" low . "" Then , focusing on the sites with moderate or JJ NNS , the NNS further classified the sites , this NN addressing the role NN NN MD have played in the shifts . They VBD the same scale for the role of NN ( low , moderate or JJ ) . In other words , the researchers sought to determine whether the JJ NNS were due to NN NN or the result of , for example , JJ activity or JJ animals . The researchers VBD that the NN period after the last NN age played a JJ role in vegetation NNS IN the NN . Areas that had the greatest NN NNS RB tended to be those with the greatest vegetation NNS , the NN showed . Indeed , the NNS VBD that NN NNS largely changed the composition of the vegetation in 71 percent of the sites IN the NN and the structure of the vegetation in 67 percent of the sites ; rising NNS moderately changed the composition in another 27 percent of the sites and the structure in 28 percent of the sites . The NNS in plant NN were most evident in mid to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere , as well as in southern South NNP , tropical and temperate southern Africa , the Indo - Pacific region , Australia , NNP Zealand and other NNS in Oceania . There were RB some sites that showed very little compositional or structural NN in vegetation , according to the paper . But nearly all sites with low compositional NN RB experienced low NN NNS . This shows that our NN is highly sensitive to NN NNS , Overpeck VBD . RB if we end up curbing fossil fuel NNS and meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement , some NN is still inevitable , but it MD affect less than half the NN , he VBD . In contrast , if we do n't meet the Paris targets , "" then we 'll have much wider NN IN the NN . "" And that NN will be much bigger and more difficult to predict . Peter Verburg , a professor of JJ geography at the NNP of Amsterdam who was not part of the research , VBD that it 's difficult to extrapolate the NN 's findings to the present day . The NN was "" VBN on paleo [ lithic ] conditions , and the present - day vegetation is incomparable [ to the vegetation in those conditions ] as JJ activities have changed land cover in some NN in about 80 percent of the terrestrial NN , "" Verburg VBD Live NNP in an email . "" Nevertheless , what we learn is that ecosystems are extremely sensitive to NNS in NN , "" he VBD . Indeed , the JJ NN is "" another confirmation that NN NN will hugely affect the NNP NN and the ecosystems we depend on , "" Verburg VBD . In other words , it is yet "" another call for immediate NN . "" Overpeck VBD that the results of this NN likely underestimate the NN that will happen in the future if we do n't curb NNS . "" There are JJ reasons why these forests are VBG to have a rougher NN [ adapting to NN NN ] in the future than they had in the past , "" Overpeck VBD , but perhaps the major reason is that the NN frame is sped up so significantly . That makes it a lot harder for the ecosystem to adjust . And we 're already seeing some NNS in plant NN today , Overpeck VBD . The NN of the NN is creating dryer ecosystems in certain parts of the NN , IN the western U.S. , Australia and Eurasia . "" So what we 're seeing in the western [ U.S. ] are whole regions of increased tree death because of NN and drying , "" he VBD . "" We are RB seeing a JJ uptick in insect and NN in forests because these trees are being weakened by the NN , "" he added ."

The film followed the early efforts of a handful of marine biologists who are fighting coral bleaching . They grow tiny bits of coral in underwater nurseries and once they ’re JJ enough move them back to the reef , hoping to restore it . Their pace is slow , possibly too slow to keep up with bleaching due to NN NN . NN waters swipe entire reefs in a matter of weeks . The biologists VBP months to nurture enough corals to restore a couple of square meters . Reef restoration seems IN an impossible task , but they are relentless . It must be done to give corals a chance , so they are doing it . It ’s the same principle guiding young NN activists , atmospheric NNS and NN essayists . As author Rebecca Solnit wrote in CD : “ We do n’t VB what is VBG to happen , or how , or when , and that very uncertainty is the NN of hope . ” You might RB VB : • Why the NN is running out of sand In the dark movie theatre , I felt a JJ bond with the NNS carrying baby corals and the filmmakers chasing after them . We are , indeed , losing this battle . They understand that , I VBP , but in a tropical gulf thousands of NNS away from where diplomats and politicians decide our NN policies and international accords , a group of stubborn biologists and documentarists were refusing to give up . They were earning their own hope , CD coral at a NN . I VBP of these dogged coral reef NNS whenever I ’m asked , “ What gives you hope ? ” in the context of NN NN . It ’s a question full of nuance . Weighing it up , you have to consider the slew of recent record - breaking heatwaves , but RB the indomitable force of schoolchildren protesting for their futures . It acknowledges our dire situation , yet suggests there might be a NN forward . As NN NN awareness goes mainstream – along with the feelings of anxiousness , NN and grief that come with it – this question has quickly become code for : “ Where can I find hope ? ”"

From England to Jamaica to the NNP NNPS , we are hearing from artists and activists IN the NN about what we can do locally , globally , and everything in between . If there ’s CD JJ - advocacy organization that needs no introduction , it ’s Greenpeace . The NGO has been RB for much longer than “ NN NN ” has been a commonplace phrase , lobbying heads of NNS and congresses IN the NN , and protesting for JJ causes on the open seas , since 1971 . Its actions have received the scorn of the fossil - fuel industry , the nuclear industry , the whaling industry , JJ other industries , and those industries ’ NN allies . ( The French NN RB admitted that its external intelligence agency , the General Directorate for External Security , VBD explosives to sink the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior in the Port of Aukland in 1985 . ) Annie Leonard is the executive director of Greenpeace USA ( the organization has 55 offices worldwide ) . NN NN is a major focus of her advocacy . “ What am I personally doing about NN NN ? A lot of things , I ’ll tell you . On an individual level , and RB on a broader society - wide level , because that ’s where we RB VBP the impacts , ” VBZ Leonard . “ CD of the things I ’m doing is RB investing in community , ” VBZ Leonard . She explains by fostering a strong sense of community with your immediate neighbors , you can better fight NN NN . They share things to reduce their NN footprints , for example , by borrowing ingredients from neighbors when baking a cake , instead of driving to the store for the CD egg needed . Having a strong community “ RB helps build support and meaning and the resilience and security that we ’re VBG to VB to VB through the NN NN together , just IN we ’re seeing strong communities RB now helping NNS VB through the NNP NN . ” Leonard RB argues it ’s important to focus on solutions , not just problems , to maintain a positive and achievable outlook on NN NN . She explains , “ NNS tell us , ‘ Oh , that ’s idealistic , you ’re asking for unicorns . ’ If you ’ve seen solutions in NN , you VBP that is not JJ . So it helps to make our commitment unshakeable . ” On a personal level , Leonard likes to grow her own vegetables , ride a bicycle , and rarely use disposable plastics , but maintains that “ those are n’t VBG to scale at the level we VBP to drive broad , broad NN . … Those are a great place to start , but a terrible place to stop . ” So where do we stop ? “ The single most important thing that we all have to do is stop burning fossil - fuels , ” including oil , coal , and gas , which Leonard points to as the leading culprit for NN NN . She RB advocates for diverting JJ subsidies away from these industries , and to renewable NN ( while taking care of communities and workers with a “ just transition ” ) . When it comes to fossil fuels : “ No JJ permits , no JJ ports , no JJ pipelines . ” Leonard VBZ the most important thing for individuals is to take NN : “ Find an organization or campaign that feels IN a good fit for you . There ’s so JJ to choose from . And contact them and ask how you can VB . If you VBP to join Greenpeace , we ’d love to have you involved . ”"

Marvin Herndon is an JJ interdisciplinary scientist , who earned his BA degree in physics in 1970 from the NNP of California , San Diego and his Ph.D. degree in nuclear chemistry in 1974 from Texas A&M NNP . For three NNS , J. Marvin Herndon was a post - doctoral assistant to Hans Suess and Harold C. Urey in geochemistry and cosmochemistry at the NNP of California , San Diego . He is the NNP of Transdyne Corporation in San Diego , California . He has been profiled in Current Biography , and dubbed a “ maverick geophysicist ” by The NNP Post . He suggested that the composition of the inner core of NNP is nickel silicide . The conventional view is that it is an iron–nickel alloy . More recently , he has suggested "" georeactor "" planetocentric nuclear fission reactors as NN sources for the gas giant outer planets as the NN source and production mechanism for the geomagnetic field and stellar ignition by nuclear fission .

An Open Letter to Members of AGU , EGU , and IPCC Alleging Promotion of NNP NNP at the Expense of NNP and NNP NNP and Comments on AGU Draft Geoengineering Position Statement In september 2017 , Dr. J Marvin Herndon published a critical expose of the AGU , EGU , and IPCC alleging the promotion of falsified NN to promote certain globalist causes . This paper can be founin its entirety at this location : An Open Letter to Members of AGU , EGU , and IPCC Alleging Promotion of NNP NNP NN of Variable NN - heat Production , JJ Non-anthropogenic NN NN , and Geoengineered JJ NN and Polar Melting The publication has been announced in PR Newswire . You can view the paper there or use the link at the bottom of this section : Quote From the Announcement Either directly or indirectly , Dr. Herndon is exposing the propaganda that is being spread by governments claiming that jet trails are "" contrails "" . NNP Skywatch has been actively working to open the NN 's eyes to this very harmful aerosol injection for NNS . In the announcement , Dr. Herndon VBZ : NN models evaluated by the IPCC are VBN on the assumptions that : ( 1 ) Heat derived from the NNP is constant ; ( 2 ) Heat derived from within the NNP is constant ; and , ( 3 ) Anthropogenic contributions to atmospheric NN stem mainly from heat retention by CO2 and other NN gases . Geophysical NN of variable earthquake activity and geological NN of variable submarine volcanism presented here indicate that heat added to the oceans is variable . The increasing occurrences of earthquakes of magnitudes ≥ 6 and ≥ 7 during 1973 - 2015 indicate volcanic activity is increasing and therefore NNP - heat , as well as volcanic CO2 additions , is increasing . Moreover , increased heat additions to the ocean act to decrease seawater solubility of CO2 , ultimately releasing additional CO2 to the atmosphere . Furthermore , increasing submarine volcanic activity implies increasing ocean acidification , but NNS are insufficient to make quantitative estimates . The validity of IPCC evaluations and assessments depends critically upon due consideration being given to all processes that potentially affect NNP ’s heat balance . In addition to the geological and geophysical processes discussed , the scientific community , including IPCC NNS , has turned a blind eye to ongoing tropospheric geoengineering that in recent NNS has been occurring on a near - daily , near - JJ basis . Tropospheric aerosolized particulates , evidenced as coal fly ash , inhibit rainfall , heat the atmosphere , and VBP JJ NN . NN obtained from an accidental air - drop release indicates efforts to melt glacial NN and enhance JJ NN . By ignoring ongoing tropospheric geoengineering , IPCC assessments are compromised , as is the moral authority of the NNP Nations . NN of Coal Fly Ash Toxic Chemical Geoengineering on the Troposphere : Consequences for NNP NNP In this NN , Dr. J Marvin Herndon exposes the NN demonstrating that toxic substances are being sprayed into the atmosphere , and that at least some of these substances match the chemical footprint for toxic coal fly ash , which is VBN to contain heavy metals such as mercury , aluminum , lead , arsenic , cadmium , selenium , thallium , boron , antimony , barium , strontium , vanadium , beryllium , chromium , and cobalt . Paper : Obtaining NN of Coal Fly Ash NN in NN Modification ( Geoengineering ) Through Analysis of Post - Aerosol - Spraying Rainwater and Solid Substances In January 2015 , Dr. Herndon wrote a letter to the San Diego city council expressing his concern about chemtrails . This letter has been reprinted below . January 16 , 2015 To : Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer , and San Diego City Council Members From : J. Marvin Herndon , Ph.D . Subject : Pervasive Toxic Aerosol Spraying of San Diego Residents I am a scientist ( PhD in nuclear chemistry , Post - Doctoral in Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry ) and businessman , and have lived in Scripps Ranch for thirty seven NNS . Over the past NN the skies above San Diego have changed drastically in plain sight . We ’ve been robbed of the beautiful blue skies we associate with our city . Almost every day jet airliners are spraying innumerable so - called “ chemtrails ” and they persist after release behind the jets to gradually form clouds . Chemical clouds . Toxic clouds . They eventually diffuse and form a white haze in the sky . Sometimes , the artificial clouds are laid so thickly as to make the otherwise blue San Diego sky fully overcast with toxic chemical aerosols . Sometimes , depending on chemical mix , the transition from spray to white haze is rapid . Please VB a few examples , attached , that I photographed from my front yard . Chemicals sprayed into the atmosphere do not remain suspended ; they fall to contaminate the air we breathe , our rainwater , and our agricultural soil . This ongoing massive spraying taking place over San Diego represents a grave threat to me and my family , my neighbors , and all my fellow San Diegans . Rainwater collected after intensive aerosol spraying now reportedly contains elevated levels of aluminum , barium , and strontium and likely other toxins . Aluminum is implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s , and NN , whose rising incidence is causing alarm to JJ Americans . How JJ additional NNS will be doomed to suffer a lifetime of NN ? How JJ additional San Diegans will suffer premature brain degeneration or cancer ? What horrors lie in store for our NNS and grandchildren who unknowingly play outdoors , or the pregnant women with their unborn offspring , or the runners and other outdoor recreationists ? What about those of us who suffer asthma or who have compromised NN systems ? What about the elderly ? What about your own family ? Are we San Diegans no longer free to breathe uncontaminated air ? Why are San Diego ’s Mayor and members of San Diego City Council silent about this imminent JJ NN threat ? Were you duped into believing that toxic chemical clouds will keep NNP from VBG ? Clouds might reflect sunlight back into NN but those same artificial clouds RB keep NNP from cooling by not letting NNP ’s heat escape during the night . Clouds , artificial or natural , trap heat ! Why the silence ? Are you afraid there will be demonstrations or riots in the streets if the truth were VBN about the ongoing activity that poisons the air San Diegans are now breathing ? Deception by acquiescence and silence is fundamentally wrong , unless you are a willing participant in activities that will likely come to be characterized as crimes against humanity . As elected officials you have the responsibility to advise and protect all San Diegans . Please speak the truth and stop this spraying over our homes . The following links provide NN you MD find of benefit .

And while JJ amounts of the green snow have been visible for NNS , it 's starting to spread across the continent because of NN NN . According to a NN published Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications , the vibrant color is caused by microscopic algae blooming across the NN of the snow . VBG satellite NNS and fieldwork observations , a team of researchers at the NNP of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey have created the JJ JJ - scale map of the green algae and predicted the future spread of the bizarre snow . Green snow appears along the Antarctic coast , growing in "" warmer "" areas , where the average NNS reach just above freezing in the summer . Although the individual algae are microscopic , when they grow at scale , the green snow can RB be seen from NN . For the NN , the team combined on - the - ground research from CD summers in the Antarctic Peninsula with images from the European NNP Agency 's Sentinel 2 satellite taken between 2017 and 2019 . In total , the team identified over 1,600 separate algal blooms on the snow NN . The team VBD that the distribution of green snow algae is strongly influenced by marine birds and mammals , because their excrement works extremely well as fertilizer . Over 60 % of blooms were VBN near penguin colonies , and others were VBN near birds ' nesting sites . "" This is a significant advance in our understanding of land - VBN NN on Antarctica , and how it might VB in the coming NNS as the NN warms , "" lead author Dr. Matt Davey of the NNP of Cambridge VBD in a press release . If bird populations are strongly affected by NN NN , as they likely will be , the algae MD lose key sources of nutrients . But the results of the NN indicate that green snow will massively spread as JJ NNS rise . That 's because in order to flourish , the organisms VBP an available supply of NN . NNS on the peninsula where the green snow is VBN have risen dramatically in recent decades , increasing the amount of NN available . As the NN warms and more of Antarctica 's snow melts , the algae will spread , the NNS VBD . And while some algae will be lost to areas that lose snow altogether , much more will be gained . "" As Antarctica warms , we predict the overall mass of snow algae will increase , as the spread to higher ground will significantly outweigh the loss of JJ island patches of algae , "" VBD co-lead author Dr. Andrew Gray , of the NNP of Cambridge and the NNP of Edinburgh . It 's unclear how the spreading algae will affect the NN . It plays a key role in cycling nutrients and pulling NN dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis , Davey VBD , but RB darkens snow , and absorbs more heat from the NN . The amount of algae VBN by the team creates a NN sink that absorbs about 500 tons of NN each NN , the equivalent of about 875,000 average car journeys in the U.K. , researchers VBD . The amount of algae VBN is actually a conservative estimate , because the satellite was only capable of picking up green algae , missing its red and orange counterparts . "" The snow is multi-colored in places , with a palette of reds , oranges and greens — it 's quite an amazing sight , "" Davey VBD ."

But the urgency IN the issue reached JJ heights in 2018 when the NNP Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) stated that rapid , "" far - reaching and unprecedented NNS in all aspects of society "" MD be needed in order to drop NN dioxide levels by 2030 and prevent catastrophic JJ NN . NNS have indeed proposed drastic measures — just not in the NN that you might VB . In the same IPCC report , the U.N. suggests that adding 2.5 CD acres ( 1 CD hectares ) of forest to the NN MD limit JJ NN to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1.5 degrees Celsius ) by 2050 . In other words : Responding to NN NN will require planting JJ trees . A lot of them . And now , the U.N. might just have the NNS to back up their proposal . In a recent NN , unveiled July 5 , 2019 in the journal NNP , a group of researchers associated with the Crowther Lab in Switzerland VBD that JJ tree restoration to the tune of 223 CD acres ( 900 CD hectares ) of canopy cover — an area that 's approximately the size of the U.S. — is "" our most effective NN NN solution to date . "" These trees MD store 205 CD tons ( 186 metric tons ) of NN , or roughly CD thirds of the NN that has been emitted "" as a result of JJ activity since the Industrial Revolution , "" according to a press release . Although some NN reports have VBN this much forest restoration is the equivalent of roughly 1 trillion trees , this statistic is actually linked to an estimate from an older 2015 NN . Jean - François Bastin , the Crowther Lab 's NN lead author , breaks down their 2019 analysis by email . "" The idea was to estimate what tree cover MD be expected when you removed the ' JJ factor , ' i.e. what specific types of forest MD naturally occur in the absence of other development , and where , "" he VBZ . Bastin and his team VBD a form of artificial intelligence VBN as "" machine learning "" to build "" a model to link tree cover with NN / soil / topography , VBN on 78,000 observations of tree cover in protected areas . "" The researchers then projected the NNS further to estimate the "" total potential tree cover of the NN , "" Bastin explains . Afterward , the team excluded land currently being VBN for urban settlements , croplands and existing forests , which yielded the total amount of land available for restoration . The NN includes a map showing how much tree coverage JJ parts of the globe can support ; the top three areas include NNP , Canada and the U.S . In JJ ways , the NN 's timing MD n't be more perfect , as it aligns with current JJ efforts IN ecological restoration . CD example is the Trillion Trees Vision , which seeks to restore 1 trillion trees by 2050 . Another is the Bonn Challenge , which is a partnership between the NN of Germany and the U.N. 's International Union for Conservation of Nature that aims to restore 371 CD acres ( 150 CD hectares ) of deforested land by 2020 . You might be thinking , well , that sounds pretty easy . Let 's all roll up our sleeves and save the NN by planting CD tree at a NN — RB ? But some experts VBP the situation is actually a little more complicated than that rosy picture . Especially if most nations do n't chip in to VB . "" Implementation of forest restoration on the scale discussed in this paper is not as straightforward as it might seem , "" VBZ Jim Hallett , chair of the board of directors for the Society for Ecological Restoration . "" By 2018 , there were commitments of over 420 CD acres ( 170 CD hectares ) by 58 nations , which exceeds the Bonn Challenge goal . Current estimates indicate that RB 29 percent of the committed lands are now under restoration , but most of this work has been done by a few NNS . "" Hallett cites major challenges to implementing restoration on such a JJ scale , "" including financing , governance , land tenure and ownership , [ and ] capacity to do the work . "" Hallett concludes , "" there is ample NN that , in some contexts , if the benefits of restoration are not equally shared , the project will fail . So incentive programs have to be carefully developed . "" Although Hallett agrees that forest restoration is important to addressing NN NN , restoration alone will likely not be enough . It takes NN , after all , to implement such JJ restoration projects and RB for these trees to store NN . And Hallett stresses that "" the possibility of future restoration should not be VBN as an excuse for degrading intact lands . "" Other NNS question not only the practicality of the NN 's claims , but RB the NN 's very methodology . "" JJ of the allegedly available restoration areas are clearly unsuitable for more trees than they currently support . If you look closely at the map , a JJ proportion of these areas are in regions where soils are permanently frozen , "" VBZ Eike Luedeling , a NN NN researcher and professor of horticultural sciences at the NNP of Bonn . Luedeling continues , "" The methodology implicitly ( probably not on purpose ) implies that NN NN is proportional to canopy cover , i.e. ecosystems without trees contain no NN . This is clearly JJ and strongly inflates the JJ estimate [ of restoration ] . "" Jan Börner , Luedeling 's colleague and a professor for economics of sustainable land use at the NNP of Bonn , is similarly skeptical . Börner VBZ that some areas being proposed for restoration under the current NN are already in use for other purposes . Börner considers the NN to be an "" interesting academic exercise ... but as a [ NN NN ] mitigation strategy proposal ( and it is being advertised as such ! ) , it sends a misleading signal to the international NN policy debate . "" But do n't fret just yet . Both Bastin and Hallett emphasize that the U.N. has declared 2021 to 2030 the "" Decade on Ecosystem Restoration , "" which MD spur nations to act quickly — and some NNS are already tackling the initiative head on . And , according to Hallett , forest restoration boasts far more perks than just impacting NN NN , including maintaining — or RB increasing — biodiversity and preserving the ecosystem that we NNS rely upon for our food and NN . But RB the NN 's authors acknowledge that it 's VBG to take a lot of goodwill to make this grand vision a reality . "" What we VBP is universal NN : international agencies , NGOs , governments , all citizens — anyone can be involved , "" VBZ Bastian . "" Local communities and JJ organizations MD be especially effective . While they do not have the same reach as national agencies , they have the benefit of knowing what works best in their own backyards . "" This story is part of Covering NNP Now , a JJ collaboration of more than 250 NN outlets to strengthen coverage of the NN story ."

ISBN_NNP ._.","Scenario in which JJ civilization experiences catastrophic events due to NN NN A NN apocalypse ( RB called a NN dystopia and a NN - induced collapse , among other names ) is a hypothetical scenario involving the JJ collapse of JJ civilization and potential JJ extinction as either a direct or indirect result of anthropogenic NN NN and ecological breakdown . Under a JJ catastrophe of this scale , some or all of the NNP MD be rendered uninhabitable as a result of extreme NNS , severe NN events , an inability to grow crops , and an altered composition of the NNP 's atmosphere . [ 1 ] Although there is consensus on the attribution of recent NN NN to JJ activity , [ 2 ] and concern about future tipping points and feedback loops , there is no consensus on the likelihood of NN - induced collapse .[ citation needed ] Rhetoric and belief centered on apocalypticism has deep roots in religious contexts , and similar rhetorical approaches undergird secular apocalyptic interpretations of NN . [ 3 ] Historical interpretations fall into CD visions of apocalypse : the tragic and the comic . Tragic apocalypticism frames a clearly divided good and evil , with preordained events . In contrast , comic framing emphasizes flawed JJ agency , and it tends to be characterized by an open - ended , episodic , and ongoing timeline . [ 4 ] Some of the most significant books in environmentalism make use of either the tragic or comic apocalyptic framing : Carson 's Silent Spring ( 1962 ) , Ehrlich 's The Population Bomb ( 1972 ) , and NNP Gore 's NNP in the Balance ( 1992 ) . [ 5 ] There is no single agreed term VBN to describe an JJ and ecological collapse as either a direct or indirect result of anthropogenic NN NN , however such an event has been explored in both fiction and non-fiction for JJ NNS . Jules Verne 's 1889 novel The Purchase of the North Pole imagines NN NN due to a deliberate tilting of NNP 's axis . Since NNP NNP II , there has been continual discussion of JJ destruction due to nuclear NN . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] There is a Western NN tradition of describing a NN apocalypse with images and descriptions of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and other features of the apocalypse of the Christian faith . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ CD ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] JJ NN reduces the capacity of the oceans to absorb oxygen . Biomarkers and geologic NN suggests that oxygen - deprived oceans resulting from high NN dioxide concentrations MD have contributed to the five previous mass extinction events in NNP 's history . Geoscientists have VBN that anaerobic microbes MD have thrived in these conditions and produced vast amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas . Hydrogen sulfide is toxic , and its lethality increases with NN . At a critical threshold , this toxic gas MD have been released into the atmosphere , causing plant and animal extinctions both in the ocean and on land . Models suggest that this MD RB have damaged the ozone layer , exposing NN on NNP to harmful levels of UV radiation . Deformities VBN in fossil spores in Greenland provides NN that this MD have occurred during the Permian extinction event . At the end of the Paleocene and Triassic eras , mass extinctions occurred at NN dioxide concentrations of RB 1,000 ppm . If these concentrations were reached again in the future , either as a result of anthropogenic or naturally occurring NN gas NNS , it is possible that such an event MD be repeated . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Rising NNS increase the NN of an epidemic or NN . As the NN NNS , distributors of infectious diseases such as mosquitoes and ticks spread to JJ areas and transmit illnesses to regions which MD not have experienced them otherwise . Epidemics are RB made more likely after severe NN events , such as heavy rainfall or flooding . Food scarcity MD lead some communities to a more meat - VBN diet , which raises the NN of outbreaks of diseases such as ebola . Melting permafrost RB threatens to release diseases that have been dormant for JJ NNS , as was the NN in August CD when a thawed reindeer carcass that was almost a century old infected several individuals in Siberia with anthrax . [ 15 ] JJ plants have a maximum NN at which they can grow , and NN NN MD mean that JJ pests are introduced to areas where it was too cold for them to survive before . Extreme NN events and more frequent droughts will RB affect crop production as the NNP approaches and surpasses 2 °C ( 3.6 °F ) above pre-industrial levels . [ 16 ] A JJ decline in food availability MD lead to severe impacts on JJ NN . If the NNP 's NN increases to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2050 , some models predict that JJ food availability MD be 3.2 percent lower than if no NN NN occurred , resulting in an additional 529,000 deaths worldwide . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The combination of heat and humidity can impair the JJ body 's ability to cool itself , leading to hyperthermia , a potentially NN - threatening condition . A 2017 review considered research over past decades and predicted that under the high - end RCP 8.5 scenario given in the 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report ( which predicts a 3.2°C - 5.4 °C ( 5.76-9.72 °F ) increase in JJ average NNS by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels ) , by 2100 , RB 73.9 % of the JJ population MD live in environments of lethal heat illness for routine JJ NN , compared with RB 30.6 % in 2000 . [ CD ] [ failed verification ] As regions become too hot to inhabit or grow crops , as NN becomes more scarce , as NN levels rise and as extreme NN events grow more frequent and more severe , it is likely that more NNS will be displaced from their homes , which MD result in JJ instability and conflict when these NNS move to JJ areas . [ 1 ] According to the 2019 NNP Report on Internal Displacement by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre , 61 % of all JJ internal displacement in 2018 was caused by natural disasters , totalling 17.2 CD NNS . [ 20 ] Some predict that as the number of migrants from poorer nations increases , wealthier nations will impose higher restrictions on immigration and governments will become increasingly authoritarian and populist . Some areas , such as Europe , are more vulnerable to the stresses of increased migration as a result of their geographical location as well as diplomatic relations with bordering nations . [ 21 ] The NNP is currently undergoing its sixth mass extinction event as a result of JJ activity . During the Permian–Triassic extinction event 250 CD NNS ago , the NNP was approximately 6 °C higher than the pre-industrial baseline . At this NN , 95 % of living NNS were wiped out and NN NN suffocated due to a lack of oxygen in the ocean . [ 1 ] During the previous mass extinction IN 66 CD NNS ago , an asteroid or NN is predicted to have collided with the NNP , drastically altering the NN 's NN and wiping out the dinosaurs as well as RB 75 % of all plant and animal NNS on the NN . [ 22 ] NN NN increases the frequency and intensity of extreme NN events including droughts , storms and flooding . Although it is not possible to determine whether or not a specific natural disaster occurred because of NN NN , it is possible to VB how much more likely a natural disaster was as a result of NN NN . [ 23 ] As NNS increase , glaciers and NN sheets melt and the ocean expands which causes a rise in NN levels . NN levels have risen by about 23 cm since 1880 and are currently rising at RB 3.2 mm each NN . [ 24 ] It is difficult to predict amounts of NN - level rise over the next century , although the NN sheets are melting earlier than predicted which makes a high - end scenario of 2 metres of NN - level rise by 2100 increasingly plausible . [ 25 ] If the entire Greenland NN sheet were to melt , the NN 's oceans MD rise by more than 6 metres . [ 26 ] In the past , at times when the NNP has been 6 °C above the pre-industrial baseline , NN levels were 20 metres higher than today . [ 1] If all the NN on land and at the poles melted , NN levels MD rise by more than 65 metres . [ 26 ] Rising NN levels result in forced migration and threaten services IN the Internet , since much of the Internet 's key infrastructure is built near coastlines and is not built to be permanently submerged in NN . [ 27 ] Abrupt NN NNS have occurred in the past , most clearly recorded in NN records from glacial NN on Greenland . There have been several explanations put forward for these NNS , but the prevailing paradigm is that these NNS were a result of NNS in ocean currents , specifically the northward transport of heat by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation ( AMOC ) . CD example of this is the Younger Dryas , in which a rapid decline in NN , recorded in Greenland as a drop of 4 to CD °C ( 7.2 to 18 °F ) over just a few decades , is thought to have been caused by the melting of the Laurentide NNP Sheet providing extra freshwater to the North Atlantic and interrupting the AMOC . [ 28 ] It is believed that recent NN NN has caused a 15 - 20 % slowing of the Gulf Stream , a current which transports warm NN from the Gulf of Mexico towards north - west Europe , due to a melting of the Greenland NNP Sheet resulting in JJ amounts of freshwater pouring into the North Atlantic . [ 29 ] Although it is likely to continue to slow , it is unproven whether the Gulf Stream MD come to a complete halt this century , if ever . However if it does , this MD have profound impacts upon JJ parts of the NNP 's NN . In the UK , for example , NNS MD drop by an average of 3.4 °C ( 6.1 °F ) and more so in Scotland . Rainfall during the growing season MD RB drop by 123 mm . This MD reduce the UK's arable land from 32 percent to just 7 percent and it is uncertain if there MD be enough NN to offset this through irrigation , resulting in food shortages . [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Research has shown that aside from worsening income inequality and the strain of an increased population exceeding the carrying capacity of an environment , another important factor which MD lead to JJ collapse is ecological strain . NN NN increases the strain on the NN 's ecology , especially in terms of resource depletion . [ 32 ] NN NN has contributed to the collapse of civilisations in the past . A 200 - NN drought caused cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation to be abandoned ; the Khmer Empire collapsed as a result of successive droughts and monsoon floods which led to JJ and JJ unrest ; and a period of cooling called the Little NNP Age made it more difficult for Vikings to farm in Greenland , which was CD of the reasons that they were forced to abandon their settlements . [ 26 ] More recently , a severe drought in the late 2000s which is likely to have been intensified by anthropogenic NN NN contributed to failing agricultural production in Syria , leading to high unemployment , JJ amounts of internal displacement , heightened ethnic tensions and increased violence . Poor governance and neoliberal JJ policies RB contributed to the resulting civil NN and societal collapse in 2011 . [ 32 ] Although the entire NN is affected by NN NN , the worst impacts will be felt by the NN 's poorest NNS , and these NNS are both more likely to face the effects of societal collapse and more likely to face such effects sooner . This is CD of the moral issues described within the NN justice movement of NN NN activism . [ 32 ] As societal collapse becomes more likely , it is possible that denial and anti-intellectualism will increase as well , or that NNS will assign blame for the NN on communities other than their own . As localised violence increases , societal collapse RB becomes more likely . [ 32 ] The NN of JJ conflict , especially in more vulnerable regions , rises with JJ NN . Studies have shown that extreme NN events can damage economies , lower food production and raise inequality , which can increase risks of violence when combined with other factors . CD NN VBD that NN NN has influenced between 3 % and 20 % of armed conflict in the last century , that an increase of 2 °C above pre-industrial levels more than doubles the current NN of conflict , increasing it to 13 % , and that an increase of 4 °C multiplies the NN by five , up to a 26 % NN . [ 33 ] A report by the NNP Peace Index VBD that 971 CD NNS lived in areas with either a high or very high NN NN exposure and that 400 CD of those NNS lived in NNS with low levels of peacefulness . It warned that NN NN can increase the likelihood of violent conflict by impacting upon resource availability , job security , and by causing forced migration . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] NNS struggle to reach a consensus on the likelihood of NN as a result of NN NN as future NN NN is likely to be very JJ from what humanity has experienced previously and the ability of societies to adapt is unclear . [ 33 ] [ 36 ] JJ - scale NNS to the NNP NN such as tipping points and possible abrupt NN NN are usually not included in NN models and impact assessments . [ 37 ] This means that JJ scientific reports , including the IPCC Assessment Reports , have often underestimated the impacts of NN NN effects . [ 38 ] NN NNS MD RB downplay potentially disastrous scenarios in favor of more restrained predictions that are less likely to be rejected as alarmist or fatalist . [ 38 ] Discussions of ' tail - end ' risks of NNS rising beyond 3 °C ( 5.4 °F ) are RB often neglected in research more generally . [ 39 ] Current levels of JJ NN are often calculated in terms of the JJ average increase in the NNP 's NN compared with levels prior to the Industrial Revolution . In CD , the NNP is likely to have reached 1.1 °C ( 1.98 °F ) above pre-industrial levels . [ 40 ] The rate of JJ NN is influenced by the amount of NN gases released into the atmosphere , which has so far led to a linear increase in JJ NN . However JJ NN is non-linear , and is subject to acceleration when certain tipping points are crossed in the NNP 's NN NN , or as atmospheric pollution disappears from the atmosphere . These MD RB lead to abrupt NN NN . As of December 2019 , current JJ NN policies MD take the NN to between 2.3 °C and 4.1 °C ( 4.14 -7.38 °F ) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 , while current pledges and targets MD take the NN to between 2.3 °C and 3.5 °C ( 4.14-6.3 °F ) . [ 41 ] If all of the fossil fuels on NNP were burned , lower - end estimates calculate that 5 trillion tonnes of NN NNS MD be released into the atmosphere , resulting in a possible CD °C of NN relative to 1986 - 2005 by the NN 2300 . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] It is more likely that the NNP will cross tipping points and / or trigger abrupt NN NN as it approaches and surpasses 2 °C above pre-industrial levels . [ 37 ] Some of these tipping points MD lead to accelerated JJ NN and runaway NN NN . In the event that NN is limited to 2 °C by 2100 , these NN cycle feedbacks MD still VB an additional 0.24-0.66 °C ( 0.432-1.188 °F ) of NN by that NN . These tipping points MD be triggered much earlier , and MD continue to warm the NN for hundreds or RB thousands of NNS . [ 44 ] During the 1950s and 60s , NNS determined that the amount of solar radiation reaching the NNP had dropped . This was labelled the JJ dimming effect and has since been proven to have a strong relationship to atmospheric pollution , the particles of which directly absorb NN from the NN before reflecting it back into NN . This has JJ impacts including the cooling of the NNP and oceans leading to lower rainfall and more droughts . These pollutants RB lead to the formation of smog and acid rain and VBP various respiratory diseases . JJ dimming MD RB VB heat waves and runaway fires , while the decrease of sunlight negatively impacts plant growth , endangering animal populations . [ 45 ] As NN NNS are reduced and the amount of pollution in the atmosphere disappears , the most widely credited studies indicate that there will be an increase of about 0.5 °C in JJ average NN , however some studies have indicated that up to 1.1 °C is possible . [ 46 ] [ 45 ] Some solutions to this dilemma MD be to use natural geoengineering solutions such as mass rewilding and biochar alongside a reduction of NN NNS . Other potential solutions MD be much more dangerous and unpredictable , such as artificially injecting additional sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere . [ 47 ] This MD lead to disproportionately negative impacts on certain regions over others , causing droughts , flooding or desertification . [ 48 ] A paper published in the journal PNAS in August 2018 entitled "" Trajectories of the NNP NNP in the Anthropocene "" described a threshold which , if crossed , MD trigger multiple tipping points and self - reinforcing feedback loops that MD prevent stabilization of the NN , causing much greater NN and NN - level rises and leading to severe disruption to ecosystems , society , and economies . It described this as the "" Hothouse NNP "" scenario and proposed a threshold of RB 2 °C above pre-industrial levels , arguing that decisions taken over the next decade MD influence the NN of the NN for tens to hundreds of thousands of NNS and potentially RB lead to conditions which are inhospitable to current JJ societies . The report RB VBZ that there is a possibility of a cascade of tipping points being triggered RB if the goal outlined in the Paris Agreement to limit NN to 1.5- 2.0 °C ( 2.7-3.6 °F ) is achieved . [ 44 ] RB in mid-range scenarios of RB 3 °C above pre-industrial levels , extreme NN events , JJ - scale loss of agricultural land and freshwater sources , and collapsing ecosystems MD lead to widespread suffering and instability and over a CD NNS who currently live in major coastal cities MD VB to be relocated due to NN - level rise . CD report published by the NNP Challenges Foundation wrote that the potential destruction of high - end scenarios are beyond their capacity to model , but that there is a high likelihood of JJ civilization coming to an end . The report VBZ that we are currently in a position where we can reduce the NN of civilization collapse due to NN NN , and possibly avoid it . [ 39 ] Although runaway NN NN MD be triggered at 2 °C or RB lower , societal collapse in JJ regions MD not happen until later , although there is no consensus as to when this MD happen . Some NNS and institutions such as the NNP Bank have argued that it is uncertain whether NN to a 4 °C NN is possible , and that such an increase in NN is incompatible with an organised JJ community . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 49 ] Grist advised that although some NNS describe an expectation of a horrible NNP Apocalypse , the effects of NN NN MD be lessened or worsened depending upon when a coordinated response to lessen the damage develops . [ 50 ] KQED reported that the scientific consensus is to take whatever NN possible , wherever possible , RB when there are reports of a coming NNP Apocalypse . [ 51 ] NNS commenting in The Atlantic VBD that the Representative Concentration Pathway was an important measurement to watch , and that as of 2018 this measurement predicts a worst - NN scenario for the NN . [ 52 ] Stratospheric aerosol injection , a hypothetical process for blocking sunlight from the NN , is proposed as a desperate technological response to reduce existential NN . [ 53 ] What if we stopped pretending ? An article written for The NNP Yorker by Jonathan Franzen in September 2019 argued that those under the age of sixty at NN of publishing were likely to VB the radical destabilization of NN on NN due to crop failures , fires , crashing economies , flooding , and hundreds of millions of NN refugees , while those under the age of thirty were almost certain to VB it . [ 54 ] The article attracted huge controversy for arguing that humanity must now accept that a NN apocalypse is inevitable , and was heavily criticized for being defeatist , as well as for drawing JJ scientific conclusions that such a scenario was inevitable , rather than possible . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] A report published in November 2007 by various authors including JJ director of the NNP R. James Woolsey Jr. , JJ national security advisor to NNP Gore Leon Fuerth , and JJ chief of staff for NNP NNP NNP John Podesta entitled "" The Age of Consequences : The Foreign Policy and National Security Implications of NNP NNP NNP "" describes both a "" severe "" and a "" catastrophic "" scenario in which JJ NN reaches 1.6 °C ( 2.88 °F ) above pre-industrial levels by 2040 and 5.6 °C ( 10.08 °F ) by 2100 respectively . [ 57 ] In the "" severe "" scenario , nonlinear NN NN has devastating impacts on society including a possible NN ; societal instability due to JJ increases in migration and food and NN shortages ; threatened identities of JJ communities as a result of rising NN levels and coastal flooding ; likely conflict over resources and possible nuclear NN . The authors write that in this scenario NN NN causes humanity to undergo a permanent shift in its relationship to nature . [ 57 ] In the "" catastrophic "" scenario , the authors write that JJ society MD struggle to adapt , and note that this scenario is so extreme that its impacts are difficult to imagine . The authors encourage readers to compare the scenario to the threat of terrorism , emphasising that the solution to both threats relies on a transformation of the NN 's NN economy . [ 57 ] In NNP 2019 , Breakthrough - National Centre for NNP Restoration released a report which argued that NN NN represents an existential threat to JJ civilisation in the near to mid-term , calling for a wartime level of response to combat it . [ 58 ] The report featured heavily in the NN due to the gravity of its message . [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] The report described a "" 2050 scenario "" which the authors define as a NN of thinking at the high - end of the range of possibilities rather than a scientific projection . Within this scenario , policy - makers fail to act sufficiently and JJ NNS do not peak until 2030 . NN feedbacks are triggered which lead to JJ NN of 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels by 2030 , and 3 °C by 2050 , leading the NNP into the "" hothouse NNP "" scenario . NN levels increase by 2 - 3 metres by 2100 , with an eventual 25 metres of NN - level rise locked in . Some regions become unlivable due to the intense heat and lack of adaptive capacity and RB a CD NNS are displaced , while CD CD NNS suffer from NN shortages . There is not enough food to feed the JJ population and JJ of the NN 's most populous cities are abandoned due to NN level rise . [ 58 ] In an interview for The Ecologist , the Emeritus Director of the Potsdam Institute for NNP Impact Research Prof . Hans Joachim Schellnhuber warned that if we continue as we are now , then over the next century we MD bring civilization to an end . He predicted that NNS MD survive somehow , but that almost everything which had been built up over the past CD thousand NNS MD be destroyed . He rated chances of success in the fight against NN NN as more than 5 % but definitely less than 50 % . [ 62 ] In his 2019 BBC documentary NNP NNP – The Facts , Sir David Attenborough warns that dramatic NN needed to be taken against NN NN within the next decade to avoid irreversible damage to the natural NN and the collapse of JJ societies . [ 63 ] In a 2019 Channel 4 interview with Jon Snow , Attenborough VBZ that the worst outcome of NN NN that MD be experienced within the next seventy NNS MD be civil unrest and mass migration on a great scale . He predicts that NNS will continue to find enough food , but that their diets will be forced to VB . [ 64 ] Professor Emeritus of NN strategy at the BI Norwegian Business School Jørgen Randers predicts that we will fail to meet the pledges of the Paris Agreement as in the short - term it is cheaper to continue acting as usual . [ 65 ] As a lifelong environmentalist , Prince Charles has given speeches warning that NN NN MD bring unimaginable horrors and that it calls into question our future survival on the NN . [ 66 ] Pope Francis has stated that NN NN threatens the future of the JJ family and that we must take NN to protect future generations and the NN 's poorest who will suffer the most from humanity 's actions . He has RB stated that our choice of NN has the potential to destroy our civilization and that this must be avoided . [ 67 ] In an interview , the Secretary - General of the NNP Nations António Guterres warned that the NN was losing the fight against NN NN , and described lack of NN on NN NN as "" suicide "" . [ 68 ] According to Professor Jem Bendell , Deep NNP is the concept purporting that humanity needs to prepare for fundamental disruption of its current civilisation paradigms , due to NN NN , with a likelihood of complete societal collapse . Unlike NN NN NN , which aims to adapt societies gradually to the effects of NN NN , Deep NNP is premised on accepting abrupt transformation of the environment as a consideration for making decisions today . [ 69 ] In 2019 , Jem Bendell started the Deep NNP Forum . According to the website , the Deep NNP Forum is an "" international JJ NN to connect NNS , in all spheres of NN , to foster mutual support ; collaboration ; and professional development in the process of facing societal collapse . "" [ 70 ] Bendell RB created a Deep NNP NNP group for discussing these topics . Various academic publications describe how JJ discourse , the NN , and scientific studies address the idea of a potential NN apocalypse . [ 71 ] NNS in various cultures at various times have VBN stories about NN NN . [ 72 ] Among all cultures and times which tell these stories , patterns in the stories which repeat include questioning whether NNS caused the NN , the relationship between short - term local experiences and longer term JJ records , NNS of common cultures producing images of NN NN which align with others in their culture but not with those outside their culture , designating certain classes of institutions IN laboratories as being reliable sources of NN , and the modification of reliable reports to create a more desirable narrative of how the NN ought to lead to a particular community changing their behavior . [ 72 ] Discussion of NN NN is unusual for having attracted unusually diverse participation of communities which strongly present their own view . Those communities include citizens engaged in JJ participation , academic sectors , any non-academic professional sector asserting NN , participants in popular culture , advocates for Indigenous peoples , anyone negotiating the powers of capitalism , those practicing a religion , and anyone responding to JJ opinion . [ 72 ] Sources of NN about NN NN tell various categories of stories , including personal experiences , community experiences , scientific models , JJ forecasts , and prophecies of apocalypse . [ 72 ] Some researchers have speculated that society cannot comprehend an accurate end of the NN prediction , and instead , more governments MD be willing to respond productively to prevent catastrophe if reports framed the matter as a smaller problem than it actually is . [ 73 ] Talking about potential disaster can have a broad impact upon society by making JJ NNS feel that if the situation were truly horrible , then there must be good plans to prevent it so no further NN is needed . [ 74 ] As NN apocalypse becomes more real , the NN presents JJ imagined apocalypse scenarios in a NN that conflates them all . [ 75 ] JJ conversations about NN apocalypse tend to describe how preventing it in the future MD bring zero value for today , therefore the value of doing something today is zero . [ 76 ] The lack of response to NN NN despite it being an existential NN MD be an indication that JJ society lacks an ability to understand a threat of this magnitude without some radical NN in perspective . [ 77 ] Esquire described how since 1990 NN NNS have communicated urgent warnings while simultaneously experiencing the NN converting their statements into sensational entertainment . [ 78 ] A 2013 report described how incorporating the concept of preventing catastrophe into JJ policy seems unprecedented and challenging to accomplish . [ 79 ] NN fiction is a popular NN genre which frequently features stories of NN apocalypse . Examples include Ismael , a 1992 philosophical novel , [ 80 ] and Mad Max : Fury Road , a 2015 NN film . [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Concern over a NN apocalypse has been the subject of articles of satirical NN features . CD theme is popular revolt against NN brokers . Another is the desire of youth to have a liveable environment in adulthood . [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Another are fantasies about the romance and adventure of NNS experiencing the chaos of ecological and societal collapse . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] • None Stoknes , Per Espen ( September 2017 ) .

The US NN has just pulled the NN ’s second - largest emitter of NN gases out of the Paris NN accord . Ms Thunberg demands significantly more than a 50 per cent cut in JJ net NNS by 2030 . The NN is certainly irresponsible . But the latter seems inconceivable . The exasperation of radical NN activists is understandable . Despite decades of talk , NNS of NN gases and JJ NNS continue to rise . If the trend does not alter soon , the chances of avoiding an increase in JJ average NNS of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will be zero and those of avoiding a 2C increase will be tiny . As the IMF notes in its latest Fiscal Monitor , meeting the latter goal requires reducing NNS of NN gases by a third below the baseline , by 2030 . To keep below a 1.5C increase , NNS VBP to be half of the baseline . The longer the delay in acting , the larger the required NN becomes , until nothing can be done because it will be too late . It is already almost too late to avoid what experts view as destructive and irreversible NNS in NN . For that reason , dramatic policies are needed . Yet they are feasible , argues the NNP Transitions Commission , if they are firmly implemented over the next three decades . Unfortunately , the outright opposition of NNS such as Mr NNP , and the indifference of much of the population , are not the sole obstacles to success . RB some who favour NN are a problem , because the NN NN is for them part of a wider campaign against the NN . Thus , JJ supporters of the Green NNP Deal view NN as a justification for the planned economy . As British journalist Paul Mason argues : “ Labour wants to combat NN NN through three mechanisms : NN spending , NN lending and the NN direction of private finance . ” This approach allows opponents to argue that the left is more concerned with destroying NN economies than saving the NN . The mess created by trying to plan an economy into zero net NNS in a decade might bring all attempts at mitigation into disrepute . In any NN , NN NN will not be solved by CD country . To succeed , policy must be effective , legitimate and JJ . To be effective , policy must combine planning , regulation , research and incentives . There is strong justification for NN actions in research , spatial planning and finance . But there is RB a NN for incentives aimed at shifting behaviour . Command and NN are rarely as effective all on their own . The IMF report suggests $ 75 a tonne of NN might be the NN in 2030 consistent with keeping the NN increase below 2C . Today , while there are a host of pricing arrangements , the prices themselves are mostly far too low and variable over NN and across NNS to be useful . Yet , in principle , a NN tax , or an NNS trading NN with a NN floor , is the most effective ( because most comprehensive ) NN to influence NNS . Schemes that generate fiscal revenue ought RB to be attractive to politicians , because the NN can be VBN for other valuable purposes . Taxing a “ bad ” ( a form of pollution , in this NN ) always offers an opportunity to improve taxation or raise valuable spending . An important point made by the IMF report is that such NNS as NNP and India MD benefit especially from a reduction in local JJ pollution , because of the benefits of reduced use of coal . It is RB vital that these NNS do VB such benefits from use of NN taxes , because they are VBG to have to play a JJ part in bringing about the needed reductions in JJ NNS ( relative to the baseline ) . It is in these NNS , too , that a huge part of the needed investment in JJ NN systems must be made . So incentives matter greatly . To make policy legitimate , it is essential to compensate losers . It is not JJ that the poor are always proportionately most adversely affected by higher NN prices . But protests by the rest of the population matter , too . Compensation for higher fuel prices needs to be visible . As important , a convincing vision of a better future must be offered . Otherwise , the necessary NNS in policy will never be accepted . Finally , policy has to be JJ , with all the bigger economies involved . This creates huge problems of equity . Clearly we are never VBG to reach a perfect solution . But some solution will have to be VBN in generous assistance from high - income NNS to emerging and developing NNS , especially with the introduction of JJ technologies . This RB raises an important question : what is to be done with free - riders and , above all , the biggest free - rider of all , the rogue US ? The answer in principle is clear : it will have to be penalised quite heavily . If we accept , as we should , the urgency of the challenge , this follows quite naturally . What , then , is to be done ? The answers include a programme of NN over three decades , starting now ; pragmatic resort to all policy tools , including NN - VBN incentives ; use of the revenue raised from NN pricing to compensate losers and make the tax NN and NN mitigation more efficient ; a stress on the local environment benefits of eliminating the use of fossil fuels ; and , above all , a commitment to NN as a shared JJ challenge . In an era of populism and nationalism , is there any chance of all this ? Not obviously , alas . If so , we will indeed have failed . But the young are surely JJ to expect better .

Family - owned Cairns - VBN NN Passions of Paradise have provided a catamaran and fuel . Other businesses involved include Wavelength , Ocean Freedom , Sailaway and Quicksilver Cruises . They are working alongside a team from the NNP of Technology Sydney led by Dr. David Suggett . The initiative is called the Coral Nurture Program . Similar projects in the area were already in place , such as the Crown - of - Thorns ( a coral destroying starfish ) eradication and the Eye on Reef monitoring program . But what makes this latest project unique is that it ’s the JJ NN tour NNS have worked together with researchers . The technique being VBN to restore the coral – VBG ‘ coral clips ’ , is RB a JJ . Lorna Howlett , project coordinator and PhD student , explains how it works : “ It involves finding fragments of opportunity – coral fragments that have naturally broken off , ” she VBD . “ And attaching them back on to the reef VBG a coral clip . We can only use fragments of opportunity VBN at the site , so Passions of Paradise has installed six frames at the site which can be VBN as a nursery to grow more corals . ” Approximately 1000 pieces of coral have been planted on Hastings Reef so far . The Great Barrier Reef is home to an incredibly diverse array of sea-life and was declared a NNP Heritage Area in 1981 . Situated off the northeast coast of Australia , it stretches for RB 2300 km . It is the biggest coral reef NN in the NN , comprising RB 2900 individual reefs and 900 islands . A 2014 report by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority VBD that NN NN and JJ heating is the biggest threat to the reef . Polluted land NN quality running into the NN , coastal development , fishing , ocean acidification and coral bleaching are other major issues . According to a 2012 report , the Great Barrier Reef has lost half it ’s coral since 1985 . In 2015 , the Reef 2050 Plan came into place . This is a 35 - NN plan for the JJ - term management of pollution and NN NN . Anthony McLennan is an experienced journalist who has written for some of South Africa ’s biggest publications . RB a photographer , soccer coach , dog- lover and surfer , enjoys spending NN outdoors in beautiful Cape Town .

As it is , 2020 will likely end up as CD of the hottest NNS in history , with more devastating storms , droughts and floods to come , according to a groundbreaking NN recently released by Nature NNP NNP . “ Population confinement has led to drastic NNS in NN use and CO2 NNS , ” the NN ’s lead author , Professor Corinne Le Quéré of the NNP of East Anglia VBD . “ These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary though , as they do not reflect structural NNS in the JJ , transport or NN systems . ” “ NNP - CD has been disruptive , costly , and tragic , but there are some hopeful elements that we can pull out of this pivotal moment in JJ history , ” VBZ Howard , an ER NN in Yellowknife , Canada , who is RB board NN of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment and TEDx speaker . Here are five positives to take away from the NN as we continue to fight NNP - CD and the RB larger existential threat of NN NN : “ Now that JJ have mastered Zoom , and have equipped their homes for virtual work , we can expect at least some degree of telecommuting to continue as we open up and NNS VBP back to school , saving NNS up to several hours a day in commuting NN , ” Howard tells NNPS . “ We VBP that longer driving NN , particularly over a couple of hours per day , is associated with insufficient physical activity , less sleep and worse physical and mental NN , and so this gives us back our most precious resource : NN . NN to exercise , NN to cook healthy meals at home , NN to snuggle with our kids , NN to rest . ” “ When pressed , we prioritize NN and are capable of changing the NN quickly , "" VBZ Howard . "" Sometimes in NN - related work , NNS have gotten discouraged by entrenched habits and NN structures . MD we ever have pictured , at Christmas , that the NN MD VB this much , this quickly ? "" “ Now we VBP that , although our responses have n't been perfect , we can work together as a JJ community , and create significant NN - VBN NN on a quick NN - line , "" Howard adds . "" This helps us VB that a rapid , effective response to NN NN is possible . ” “ The reduction in vehicle traffic has cleared the skies in JJ cities IN the NN , allowing us to VB how bright and fresh the NN can feel when we reduce fossil fuel use , "" VBZ Howard . "" With outdoor air pollution responsible for 4.2 CD deaths a NN IN the globe , according to the NNP NNP Organization , this shows us that not only can the NN look wonderful when we use less fossil fuels , but that doing so can save lives immediately , and through decreased NN impacts of NN NN from wildfires , heat - related illness and more , [ we can ] continue to improve NN for generations to come . "" “ When we work together , we can save lives , and by building back better , we can save more , "" she VBZ . "" I went to school for NNS to learn how to save lives in the Emergency Room . By listening to NNS , NNS IN the globe have demonstrated how much we care about NN , and CD another , and have saved lives by staying home ! "" “ With the Lancet - UNICEF - WHO Future NNP Report having shown us that NN NN is CD of the major NN risks for today 's NNS , if we extend that same care for CD another to a commitment to a healthy recovery , we have a generational opportunity to channel our JJ stimulus funds into the acceleration of a transition to a clean NN economy .

In a recent NN published by the “ NNP Education Center ” at the NNP ’s Hospital of Philadelphia ( CHOP ) where he works , Offit tries to make the NN that antibody NN tests , which measure antibody levels as an indicator of immunity against NN , are n’t medically useful . If this is the NN , then everything that the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention ( CDC ) rely upon to create NN policy is RB not medically useful , or accurate . VBG antibody NN tests to try to measure a protective JJ response , in Offit ’s own words , is “ not as easily done as you MD VB . ” And yet , the presence of antibodies in the NN has RB been what NN officials claim is , in fact , a valid indicator that a person is JJ to NN – so which is it ? The answer is neither and both , depending upon what ’s trying to be accomplished . In Offit ’s NN , the goal is to keep as JJ NNS as possible on the NN train , which will ensure that NN manufacturers VBP himself continue to rake in massive profits . At the same NN , Offit ’s very argument is invalidated by his own admissions towards this end , as he clearly VBZ in the NN that antibody titer does not necessarily correlate with immunity . Similarly , a lack of antibodies is not necessarily an indicator of a lack of immunity . VBG a NN outbreak that occurred during the late 1980s and early 1990s to try to make his point , Offit VBZ in the NN that , when looking back on this particular outbreak , it was discovered that “ there were JJ NNS who had been vaccinated , but who did n’t have antibodies against NNS who were still protected . ” In other words , antibody tests are n’t , in fact , a valid indicator of immunity , RB though this is what the NN uses as “ NN ” that NNS somehow work . “ The reason they were still protected is they had something called memory cells , ” Offit further explains . “ Memory immunological cells , IN B - and T - cells , which then , when they were exposed to the NN , became activated , differentiated , made antibodies , which then protected them . So RB though they did n’t have circulating antibodies in their bloodstream , they still have these memory cells in their JJ NN that MD then respond when they were exposed . So , if you looked at those NNS and saw they did n’t have antibodies , you MD have falsely concluded they were n’t protected when they were . ” For more NN about the NN ’s NN fraud , be sure to check out Vaccines.news . Thank you , Paul Offit , for once again illustrating why NNS should n’t vaccinate their NNS Offit goes on in the NN to admit that sometimes you can have antibodies in your bloodstream “ and not be protected ” – again , his own words . As it turns out , it appears to be some combination of antibody levels , cell - mediated immunity , and mucosal immunity that provides JJ protection against NN , depending on the NN , meaning NN NN as it ’s currently being propagated by JJ NN officials is wholly inaccurate and unreliable . It remains unclear whether or not Offit truly realizes what he ’s confessed to , here , seeing as how the NN in question is still available for viewing on the CHOP website . Or perhaps Offit is too dense to RB realize what he ’s now publicly admitted , which only goes to show how deluded these NN - pushers are when it comes to their methods of persuasion . Hilariously , Offit ’s conclusion in the NN is n’t that the entirety of NN NN needs to be reevaluated due to these inherent flaws . Instead , he VBZ that , because “ titers are difficult , ” and “ not a perfect indicator ” of immunity , that “ the best NN of knowing that you ’re protected is to VB the NNS that are recommended at the NN they are recommended . ” In other words , nothing the NN lobby has been saying for decades makes an ounce of sense , and the whole thing is obviously a fraud . But keep on getting your NNS , NNS , because that ’s the only NN to keep yourself safe and healthy ! CD wonders : Who is actually buying this tripe anymore and subjecting their family to its illogical provisions ? “ Far from providing NNS with a convincing argument for why they should strictly comply with the CDC ’s childhood NN schedule , what Paul Offit and the CHOP have provided us with in this NN is a strong argument for why the very process by which NNS obtain licensure by the FDA is scientifically invalid , ” writes Jeremy R. Hammond , a contributing writer for NNP ’s NNP Defense ( CHD ) . “ Indeed , the conclusion seems inescapable that the FDA ’s use of antibody titers as a surrogate measure of immunity for the purposes of NN licensure amounts to scientific fraud . ” Be sure to read Hammond ’s full , in - depth analysis of Offit ’s NN at NNP ’s NNP Defense ."

Another icebreaker is on its NN to bring it more fuel . Such are the logistical complexities of the expedition , VBN as Mosaic , in which a German research ship , Polarstern , has been drifting with the NN NN in the Arctic Ocean since October with a revolving complement of NNS . The ship is expected to come out of the NN east of Greenland in September after gathering a NN ’s worth of NNS on conditions in the remote Central Arctic . The Kapitan Dranitsyn left Tromso , Norway , on Jan. 29 with 43 tons of food , fuel and other supplies for the Polarstern , as well as a replacement team of researchers and technicians for what is the third CD - month leg of the expedition . The resupply trip was expected to take about CD weeks , but the icebreaker ran into trouble from the start , when a storm in the Barents NNP forced it to anchor off Tromso for the better part of a week . Once underway , the ship encountered NN NN that had gotten much thicker as the winter progressed — doubling to more than 5 NNS , or 1.5 meters , in places . The Kapitan Dranitsyn finally arrived at the Polarstern on Feb. 28 . After several days unloading the supplies and transferring personnel across about a half - mile of NN in dangerous conditions ( a wind chill of minus 72 degrees Fahrenheit , or about minus 58 Celsius ) , the Kapitan Dranitsyn left for the return trip to Tromso . But calculations showed that it MD not have enough diesel fuel for the journey . So on March 3 , another icebreaker , the Admiral Makarov , left Murmansk , NNP , with a load of extra fuel to intercept the Kapitan Dranitsyn on its NN . Early this week , the CD ships were about 350 NNS , or roughly 560 kilometers , apart . Markus Rex , an atmospheric scientist who is Mosaic ’s leader , wrote in a blog post that the delay in resupplying the Polarstern was “ absolutely in keeping with what had to be expected ” given the NN conditions ."

Do we turn the lights on in the morning , or is the light of daybreak sufficient for finding matching socks ? Do we feast on bacon and eggs for breakfast , or will a bowl of oatmeal suffice ? There is a lot of talk these days about the NN to lead lower - NN lifestyles . There is RB a lot of finger - pointing VBG on and , some argue , virtue signaling . But who is truly walking the NN walk ? The carnivore who does n’t fly ? The vegan who travels to VB family abroad ? If nobody is without NN sin , who gets to cast the JJ lump of coal ? If all NN advocates were expected to live off the grid , eating only what they MD grow themselves and wearing only the clothes they ’d knitted from scratch , there MD n’t be much of a NN movement . That level of sacrifice is unacceptable to most . We do n’t VB to ban cars ; we VBP to electrify them ( and we VBP that electricity to come from clean NN ) . We do n’t VB to ban burgers ; we VBP NN - friendly beef . To spur these NNS , we VBP to put a NN on NN , to incentivize polluters to invest in these solutions . Though air travel accounts for only a paltry 2 % of JJ NNS , whether or not NN NNS should fly consumes far more than 2 % of my NNP timeline . Unfortunately , sometimes doing NN means traveling great distances , and we do n’t always have the NN or luxury to take slower low - NN options . We have a job to do , after all . But RB still , a single scientist , or RB hundreds of NNS , choosing to never fly again is not VBG to VB the NN . Purchasing NN offsets for flights is a viable means of decarbonizing your air travel , for now . However , the JJ solution , pricing NN , requires policy NN . There is a JJ history of industry - funded “ deflection campaigns ” aimed to divert attention from JJ polluters and place the burden on individuals . Individual NN is important and something we should all champion . But appearing to force Americans to give up meat , or travel , or other things central to the lifestyle they ’ve chosen to live is politically dangerous : it plays RB into the hands of NN - NN deniers whose strategy tends to be to portray NN champions as freedom - hating totalitarians . The bigger issue is that focusing on individual choices IN air travel and beef consumption heightens the NN of losing sight of the gorilla in the room : civilization ’s reliance on fossil fuels for NN and transport overall , which accounts for roughly CD - thirds of JJ NN NNS . We VBP systemic NNS that will reduce everyone ’s NN footprint , whether or not they care . The good NN is we have tactics to bring environmentally friendly ( and non-lifestyle - disrupting ) options to fruition­ : pricing NN NNS and creating incentives for renewable NN and reduced consumption . By putting a NN on NN , NNS can actually make NN by reducing NNS , selling their services to corporations that are always looking for ways to cut costs . Never underestimate the resourcefulness of Americans when there ’s a dime to be made ! But a NN on NN needs to be designed such that marginalized communities most at NN from NN impacts are n’t adversely impacted economically as well . This is why we RB VBP JJ NN at every level , from local leaders to federal legislators all the NN up to the NNP . We VBP NN not just at the breakfast table , but at the ballot box as well .

I was imagining that it MD be as fast as the Velvet Revolution that began exactly 20 NNS earlier . So JJ NN skeptics were disillusioned by the speed . Now , 14 months later , things are beginning to move at the top places . Barack Obama has n’t mentioned any NN , NN , disruption , NN , or fossil fuels in his key annual talk – RB though he was talking for a whole hour . The Guardian just brought us another dose of good NN : The boss of the NNP Nations will stop his personal involvement in the battle to regulate the NN NN . Instead , he will try to achieve “ immediate gains ” in the field of clean NN and sustainable development . RB his U.N. colleagues have apparently understood that there ca n’t be any “ deal ” . Now , obviously , I have nothing whatsoever against clean or renewable NN sources . My only complaint is against huge subsidies of such things that VBD to be justified ideologically – by the deluded propaganda about NN disruption . NN up with Fresh Food that lasts with eFoodsDirect ( AD ) If this propaganda RB goes away , as Obama and Ki-moon indicate by their shifted attitudes , there is a hope that common sense and rational costs - and - benefits analysis will return to the NN industry and beyond . In the 2011 NN of the Union address , Obama RB mentioned oil and biofuels that MD replace it . That ’s surprising because RB NNP Gore has admitted that their support of biofuels was a JJ blunder . On the other hand , I can imagine that there will exist biofuels that actually make JJ sense . What I find important is that politicians will no longer promote nonsensical solutions by general slogans that are VBN on bad NN , fearmongering , and intimidation referring to insane planetary emergencies . We , the NN skeptics , have been warning against such irrational attitudes and we have been proved RB pretty much in all NNS . JJ - generation biofuels as well as NN trading has been showed to be a disaster while solar and wind NN turned out to be significant JJ problems in JJ NNS such as my homeland . Well , of course , I do n’t VB that the politicians will completely stop doing irrational things . But the amount of this bad policymaking MD simply decrease as the rats are gradually leaving the rotten and sinking bandwagon . Let us hope that JJ other politicians will follow in Obama ’s and Ki-moon ’s footsteps . As JJ more NNS regain their common sense and all plans to regulate NN evaporate , almost everyone will VB that the NNP is doing just fine and the NN skeptics have saved trillions of dollars . Will they be rewarded or will they remain the silent heroes who have just saved the civilization without any greed ? ;-) This article was posted : Friday , January 28 , 2011 at 5:37 am"

NN in point : the trending NNP hashtag “ Autistics for Greta . ” “ She is my SHERO ! ” user @hmcooperauthor wrote in September . “ Such a fearless , articulate young woman . We might be considered ‘ odd , weird , quirky ….’ Or whatever adjectives that you prefer to insert but I ’m convinced folks on the NNP Spectrum have superpowers that you all just do n’t … ” User @ ThruThe PrismArt agreed , writing , “ I ’m on the spectrum . Anyone who underestimates Greta has NO IDEA how powerful the autistic brain is when set to a specific goal . The strength of being # ActuallyAutistic is LIMITLESS . ” “ This is it !! This is what ASD is . Passion and unending dedication to a NN , ” user @AmberOckerbloom added . “ @GretaThunberg is a superhero to my daughter and all those on the spectrum . ASD is why she is who she is . How can that ever be something bad ? ! ” Regardless of why they ’re paying attention to her , Thunberg VBD NNPS she knows she has JJ eyes watching her every move — and hopes to make the best of it . “ RB now , I have a lot of NNS listening to what I am saying , so I am VBG that platform to try to achieve a NN , ” she VBD . The disorder is characterized by having difficulty with JJ interactions , restricted interests , a desire for sameness , and distinctive strengths , IN “ remarkable ” focus and persistence , an aptitude for recognizing patterns , and attention to detail , according to NNP Speaks . Those strengths have served Thunberg well , as she explained on CBS This Morning that her Asperger ’s actually helps her in seeing the NN through a JJ lens . “ In some circumstances it can definitely be an advantage to have some kind of neurotypical diagnosis , to be neurodiverse , because that makes you JJ , that makes you VB differently , ” she VBD . “ And especially in such a JJ NN IN this , when we VBP to VB outside the box . We VBP to VB outside our current NN , we VBP NNS who VBP outside the box and who are n’t IN everyone else . ” “ I ’m not JJ about my diagnosis to ‘ hide ’ behind it , but because I VBP JJ ignorant NNS still VBP it as an ‘ illness , ’ or something negative , ” she wrote . “ I VBP she ’s a role model to everyone , ” Remi VBD NBC NNP . “ But I VBP for somebody who has Asperger ’s or is on the NN spectrum , her ability to be honest and disclose it in such an empowering NN is what ’s inspirational . Greta is disclosing it in a NN that she ’s proud of . ” “ It means a lot that she ’s willingly embraced Asperger ’s syndrome and talks about it openly . It creates a lot of awareness and destroys some stigmas , ” he VBD . “ I VBP it MD have had a tremendous impact on what I viewed as possible not only for myself , but for cultivating relationships IN me . ” “ I VBP it ’s very hopeful , all the young NNS who are a part of the NN NN movement , ” she previously VBD NNP . “ That keeps me VBG , to VB that it actually has made a difference .

But it ’s not the only NN the NN is facing , and we ought not , while confronting the immediate menace , disregard the other immense threat looming over us : JJ NN . Rather , somewhat counterintuitively , we should use the current NN to learn some lessons and glean some insights about the other perils we will soon be facing . We ’re not suggesting that NN NN contributed to the NN outbreak ; there seems to be no direct link , although experts VBP a VBG NN MD accelerate pandemics of insect - borne diseases ( the NN is spread person to person ) . But the JJ response to this NN does show that the NN can come together to confront a shared threat . That MD bode well for addressing NN NN — if we treat it as seriously . The NN is putting a chokehold on JJ activity in hard - hit regions of the NN — NNP , Europe and here in the U.S. When factories and businesses are closed , workers and customers stay home ( here in California and in NNP NNP , by order of the governors ) . With few NNS traveling JJ distances , airlines slash flights . Sure , NNS and businesses continue to use NN , but not at the levels they did just a month ago . And that reduction in NN use in turn reduces fossil fuel consumption and NNS of NN dioxide and other NN gases into the atmosphere . Little of this will be RB - lasting . Once the epidemic subsides , JJ activity will resume and so , presumably , will NNS . But the NN offers opportunities for NN , and we ought to be mindful of them as the NN and the JJ NN play out . Businesses are learning how much of their workforce can do their jobs remotely , which offers guidance for how they might operate in the future with a lighter NN footprint . Consumers are undergoing a forced experiment in changed patterns of shopping and consumption . Congress and NNP NNP RB are negotiating a series of bailouts and other support packages to VB NNS and businesses survive . They should take this opportunity to press for NNS in how some of these industries operate . The airline industry , for instance , should be asked to do more to reduce its NN NNS , which have soared in recent NNS and will continue to rise as air travel itself is projected to increase . A September paper from the International Council on Clean Transportation VBD industry NNS to conclude that commercial air operations account for 2.4 % of JJ NN NNS from burning fossil fuels , and that industry NNS in 2018 were 32 % higher than five NNS before . CD available NNS - reducing alternative is the use of so - called sustainable aviation fuels , including biofuels , but they are more expensive than conventional jet fuel . And airline NNS can be pressured to adopt aggressive plans to replace older , higher - polluting planes . That MD be in line with the demand for increased fuel efficiency commitments that the Obama administration attached to its bailout package for the auto industry . Of course , extracting NN - friendly concessions will vary by the industry seeking bailout NN , so we wo n’t VB too prescriptive here . The main imperative for the NN is to keep NN policy in NN as it devises a plan to rescue the economy . But wait , you VBP . This is the NNP administration , which at best shrugs at the NN and ignores JJ NN . JJ enough , but Congress RB is involved , and it can place NN considerations on the table . Here ’s a good place to start : The NN should not be bailing out the oil and gas industry at a NN when we should be focusing on expanding production of renewable NN and the infrastructure to store and deliver it . In recent days , early NN scoffers — including the NN — have come RB to the reality that this NN is a deadly threat and have finally begun taking strong steps to address it . Yet JJ NN is a larger and longer - lasting threat to humankind . We have about a decade , according to the experts , to make significant reductions in NN NNS to avoid the worst ramifications of NN NN . The NN already is seeing the effects in longer and more severe droughts in some places , record flooding in others , stronger and more intense tropical storms and regional NN rises that are making parts of the word nearly uninhabitable . The NN confirms all this , as it has confirmed the spread and dangers from the novel NN . So maybe accepting the reality of NNP - CD will lead the administration to recognize the reality of NN NN and work with Congress to begin addressing it in meaningful ways ."

The document , published this month on a NN website , VBD NN NN MD have a significant and growing influence on NNP ’s “ socio-economic development , living conditions and JJ NN , as well as on the NN of JJ infrastructure ” . NNP MD VB to adjust to an increase in droughts , heavy rainfall , flooding , forest fires and infectious diseases , and should start teaching NN NN in schools , it VBD . Given the “ increasing vulnerability ” of the population and economy to extreme NN and NN impacts , measures to adapt MD be of “ strategic importance ” , including “ making use of ” JJ JJ opportunities , it added . The fossil fuel - rich nation MD reap advantages from higher NNS and melting NN , including less use of NN for heating , increased access for shipping in the Arctic and an expansion of agricultural production , it noted . But NN NN experts VBD the JJ framework was too general and did not require authorities to take real steps in the near term – RB as the effects of NN NN are becoming more apparent . Alexey Kokorin , head of the NN and NN program at green group WWF - NNP , VBD the Thomson Reuters Foundation NN to a VBG NN was “ so evidently a necessity ” . The negative consequences of NN NN were “ already quite strong ” for NNP but it had yet to work out how “ to take advantage of the positive ones ” , he added . NNS in NNP have risen 2.5 times faster than the JJ average since the mid-1970s , according to the document . Recent NN - related disasters in NNP have included 2019 wildfires that raged across Siberia , destroying at least 3 CD hectares ( 7.4 CD acres ) of forest . Roman Vilfand , acting head of NNP ’s Hydrometeorology Center , noted this month that NNS across the country were far above normal levels , including 20 C higher than average in Siberia , CD of the NN ’s coldest places . Moscow ’s authorities were RB forced to bring in artificial snow for NNP NNP celebrations during the Russian capital ’s warmest December since 1886 . And in early January , NN melted on the Yenisei River in Siberia ’s Krasnoyarsk region , flooding several villages . NNP ’s Ministry of NNP Development VBD the Thomson Reuters Foundation the plan , which it produced , MD lay the foundations for a national strategy to adapt to NN NN , while raising JJ awareness of the issue . “ It will RB emphasize that the Russian Federation is ready to make efforts and systematically deal with the fight against NN NN , ” the ministry VBD in a written comment . The document outlines a framework for national NN , mainly through legislative amendments and drafting of plans for regions and JJ sectors over the next three NNS . The ministry plans to start developing and costing detailed measures only in late 2022 . “ Regions are not RB required to do anything over the next few NNS - it is a very unambitious document , ” VBD Georgy Safonov , associate professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow . Until recently NNP had no coordinated policy on NN NN NN and most of its responses to NN disasters were “ reactive ” , he VBD by email . In a JJ NN post , Russian youth NN activists in the Fridays for Future group welcomed the JJ plan but VBD “ as always , the Russian NN is in no hurry and is turning a blind eye to the sky - rocketing average NN on the NN ” . While acknowledging that the NN is heating up and NN NN poses a serious threat to NNP , NNP Vladimir Putin expressed doubt over whether NN NN is man-made at his end - of - NN press conference . NNP ’s NN gas NNS have declined significantly since 1990 , mainly due to plummeting industrial production after the collapse of the Soviet economy . In recent NNS there has been a minor increase in NNS , but they are still about 30 % lower than 1990 levels . The country ’s NNS reduction target for 2030 , set in 2015 , is to limit NN gases to 70 - 75 % of 1990 levels , which analysts consider unambitious and insufficient to VB meet JJ targets to curb NN . WWF - NNP ’s Kokorin emphasized the NN for a sharper focus on cutting NN gas NNS . “ NN has clear limits and we are not far from these limits , ” he VBD . The JJ NN framework will form part of wider NN legislation , including a JJ - term low - NN strategy , set to be adopted later this NN , after NNP formally joined the Paris NN accord last September . Meanwhile , the NN has publicly stated that it hopes to capitalize on greater access to Arctic shipping routes and natural resources - including oil , gas and minerals - as NNP ’s frozen north heats up . The amount of land available for growing crops is RB set to increase , the NN plan VBD , while livestock breeding MD become more efficient and boreal forests grow faster . But WWF - NNP ’s Kokorin warned of “ pitfalls ” and a NN of negative feedback cycles . They include faster NN caused by melting permafrost which releases JJ amounts of methane , a potent NN gas . Any boost to forest growth MD be outweighed by forest fires and unsustainable logging , Kokorin added . And damage to agriculture from hotter NNS was likely to be larger than the benefits , with soils poor in the NN north and droughts hitting the south , he VBD . “ Yes , ( NN NN ) is positive for the Russian north , but it will be very JJ compared to the south , where the negative effects will be more significant , ” he VBD ."

Adversaries have locked horns and it is impossible to have a civilized debate . You are either for or against , JJ or wrong , good or evil . There is no room for anything in between . There is simply no NN to talk , the end is nigh . Now is the NN for NN , not words . Alarm bells are ringing everywhere . There is no doubt , the NN is important : This is about melting glaciers , withering landscapes , rising NN levels and starving polar bears . What always gets left out , however , are the steps already being taken to make sure less CO2 is released into the atmosphere . The things that make factories cleaner , lower automobile NNS or RB cut them altogether by VBG electric . In most NNS , such measures are brushed off by critics as "" greenwashing . "" Here are a couple of randomly chosen examples of steps already being taken : CD NNS ago , the German steel manufacturer Salzgitter started something it called its EnergyEfficiency project . Since then , it has saved a CD tons of CO2 , as well as consuming 3,300 Terajoule less NN each NN — enough to VB some 55,000 households . Another example is NNP NNP Ferries , the NN 's second - largest ferry operator . The NN is currently in the process of converting its fleet — which had consumed some 75 CD liters ( 20 CD gallons ) of diesel fuel annually — to battery NN . But why ? Because Governor Jay Inslee signed a law mandating it . But the head of the NN has RB VBN the NN is n't just about conforming to the JJ law . He VBZ it 's a good idea , adding that you do n't have to be an JJ activist to appreciate the fact that it means quieter boats , less pollution and more financial savings . More and more NNS are VBG green Just recently , during the latest COP25 JJ NN conference in Madrid , some 180 NNS RB committed themselves to ambitious JJ goals , pledging to cut NNS continuously with the aim of being NN neutral by 2050 at the latest . And these are n't JJ , niche NNS , but rather JJ JJ corporations IN the consumer goods producer Beiersdorf ; the NN 's largest beer producer , Ambev ; and the International Airline Group , Europe 's third - largest airline holding NN ( British Airways and Iberia ) . Such commitments have practically doubled the number of NNS now in the "" Business Ambition for 1.5˚C : Our Only Future "" alliance since it was founded in September of last NN . Admittedly , other things are RB happening , things that bewilder activists and realists alike . CD VBP only look to the disaster that is the German NN transition . JJ , the percentage of NN produced by renewables has gone up , but — according to the Federal Audit Office – — some € 160 CD ( $ 179 CD ) has RB devoured in the process . Despite such efforts , the German solar industry is practically nonexistent and things do n't look much better for the wind industry . In Germany , NNS prefer to argue about minimum distances between wind turbines and the next closest village , while our French neighbors negotiate the construction of six JJ nuclear NN plants . Read more : Germany shuts down atomic plant as nuclear phase - out enters final stretch What NN activists RB VBP Either NN : Is it — as NN activists ceaselessly tell us — JJ that nothing is RB happening ? Or have the topics of sustainability and JJ compatibility finally struck a note with NNS ? And if the latter , is it because they provide a good NNS strategy ? And what MD be wrong with that if it did ? Might it not RB make sense to look closer at just what NN activists VBP ? Take Luisa Neubauer , for instance , VBN here as the German Greta Thunberg , despite being a few NNS older than the Swedish teen ; or Carola Rackete , who is internationally VBN as the refugee - saving captain of the ship NNP Watch 3 , but MD prefer to be part of the Extinction Rebellion movement . Both women have now written books : Rackete called hers "" Act : A Call to the Last Generation , "" and Neubauer titled hers "" The End of the NNP NNP . "" Both books VBP straight to the heart of the matter — they are full of ideas for bans and penalties . The authors call for those who destroy nature to be tried for crimes against humanity . Yet , neither wastes words defending individual rights , arguing that individuals cannot be trusted to decide whether they are for or against NN protection . In interviews given after her book was published , Carola Rackete went further still : "" Everything we do , or do n't do , props up the current NN . "" That 's why civil disobedience is so "" extremely urgent . "" It quickly becomes clear that what these women are after is something much bigger than NN protection : They are at NN with the existing JJ NN , with free - NN economies , and with capitalism . And anyone who is opposed to that fight , or is of a JJ opinion , simply can not be JJ . Only those who are for radical NN protection are among the good , and only they own the truth . But anyone who so vehemently clamors for an JJ planned economy should take a quick look into the recent past . It MD seem that the disastrous NN of the environment in JJ East Germany MD be enough to illustrate just how ineffective planned systems are when it comes to sustainability and NN protection . So what now ? In such a heated environment — sorry for the pun — it seems there is no chance of having a rational debate . But we have to talk about how we are VBG to tackle this challenge , and it is becoming increasingly clear that the discussion has to take place between JJ generations — CD that has experienced NN , and another that is impatient . But apocalyptic scenarios prophesying the end of the NN wo n't lead anywhere . At the most , they will simply harden opposition among those of a JJ opinion . That MD be a shame , because we VBP the ideas that young NNS have to offer . We VBP their youthful nonchalance , their openness and their curiosity . The young VBP to show us that they can do things better than us — but they should RB let us come along on the journey , at least for a while ."

JJ JJ methods6 and experiments have been VBN to better understand the differences between 1.5 °C and 2 °C of JJ NN above pre-industrial levels including timeslice extraction from coupled NN model ensembles 7,8 , use of single coupled model ensembles3,9 , multi- model atmosphere - only ensembles2 and pattern scaling 10,11 . It is not explicitly stated in the Paris Agreement text whether the NN levels refer to equilibrium or transient levels of JJ NN ; however , it is generally inferred that these targets refer to stabilized climate12 . Most of the analyses that were designed to understand the consequences of these JJ NN targets , especially those focused on atmospheric variables , VBN transient - model experiments ( analyses of NN - level rise13 and other oceanic variables often use longer coupled - model experiments ) . For example , timeslice extractions under high GHG NNS scenarios from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project experiment ( CMIP5 ) 1 sample a NN rapidly VBG through the Paris Agreement limits . Specially designed experiments , such as the Community NNP NNP Model ensemble3 , are run to emulate 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer worlds with evolving radiative forcings for CD centuries to generate climates that are , in a globally averaged sense for NN air NN , in a quasi-equilibrium NN . The atmosphere - only simulations that form the 1.5 °C and 2 °C climates in the half a degree additional NN , prognosis and projected impacts2 ( HAPPI ) experiment are forced by NN recently observed NN NN NNS VBG transient CMIP5 simulations . These JJ experiments and methods each have differing degrees of transience and none of which are in full equilibrium . Although these experiments all have value , a robust comparison between transient and equilibrium climates has not been possible owing to fundamental differences in model design . Previous research comparing transient and equilibrium climates typically VBD single JJ NN models 14,15 or a JJ ensemble of models , such that agreement and consistency between models MD be investigated 16 . As a result , some differences between transient and equilibrium climates MD be inherent to the model , or models , that were VBN in these previous analyses . Furthermore , JJ transient simulations of a single model are needed to adequately sample across phases of internal variability to make a robust comparison . Here we demonstrate that transient and quasi-equilibrium climates can be compared VBG extended medium - NNS simulations and short - term high - NNS simulations from the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble1 . Our ‘ timeshift technique ’17 enabled us to analyse multiple models concurrently , such that JJ samples of model NNS were generated for both the transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NNS . We demonstrate that , for projections of mean and extreme NNS , the use of transient or quasi-equilibrium NN NNS has a substantial effect on the outcomes . We VBD the extended mid-range GHG NNS simulations to 2300 ( ECP4.5 ) from the CMIP5 ensemble1 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) to generate a quasi-equilibrium ensemble ( noting that the NN of the twenty - third century is not in full equilibrium ) that can be directly compared to transient NN through the equivalent model ’s level of JJ NN under a high - NNS scenario ( RCP 8.5 ) . The model - simulated JJ mean NN was subtracted from the distribution of JJ - average NNS of each model to generate ensembles for the comparison of transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NNS ( Fig. 1 ) ; regional average and extreme NNS were subsequently investigated . The robustness of this method — particularly the efficacy of comparing transient and quasi-equilibrium climates derived from a selection of models across JJ NN levels — and associated sensitivity tests are discussed in the Methods and the Supplementary NN . Specifically , we demonstrate that the difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium NN patterns shows little dependence on the level of JJ NN itself ( Supplementary NN ) , which differs by almost 2 °C across the models analysed here ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We use this result to enable a comparison of the difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates with the 0.5 °C increment of NN between the Paris Agreement NN levels . From the ensembles of transient and equivalent quasi-equilibrium climates , we can infer differences between these NN NNS . For most land areas of the NN , the average boreal summer ( June–August ( JJA ) ) and winter ( December–February ( DJF ) ) NNS are substantially higher in the transient NN relative to the equivalent quasi-equilibrium NN with strong model agreement . This is especially JJ in boreal summer over continental NN zones in the Northern Hemisphere ( Fig. 2a , b ) . By contrast , over the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic , there are JJ areas where a quasi-equilibrium NN is on average at least 0.5 °C warmer than the equivalent transient NN . In the quasi-equilibrium NN , the passage of NN has resulted in heat redistribution such that the land regions are cooler and the extratropical oceans are warmer 14,18 . This result aligns with previous research showing that ocean NN lags behind NN over the land surface19 . The quantification of these differences is important , especially given the recent focus on inferring differences in future warmer climates . As land regions are warmer in the transient NN NN , most NNS in the NN MD experience higher average local NNS than in a quasi-equilibrium NN . In boreal summer , 91 % of the NN ’s population20 ( 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 76–97 % ) MD experience warmer average NNS in the transient NN NN . JJ NNS in North NNP and Eurasia MD experience at least a 0.5 °C warmer local NN in a transient NN than in the quasi-equilibrium equivalent NN . In boreal winter , 85 % of the JJ population ( 90 % CI : 70 –92 % ) are in locations where the transient NN is warmer than the quasi-equilibrium NN . In total , more than 600 CD NNS in boreal summer and more than 200 CD in boreal winter live in locations where a rapidly VBG NN is at least 0.5 °C warmer than the equivalent equilibrium NN . By contrast , fewer than 20 CD NNS live in locations where an equilibrium NN is on average more than 0.5 °C warmer than the transient equivalent for either boreal summer or winter . The difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NNS is substantial relative to the difference between the projected 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer worlds 8,11 ( Fig. 3 ) . Over the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic , where the regional projected NN from 1.5 °C to 2 °C of JJ NN is lower than elsewhere , the difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates exceeds the difference in regional NNS between the Paris Agreement levels . Both of these regions play major roles in the uptake and transport of NN and heat21 , as they warm at much slower rates compared with other parts of the NN . Overall , RB 15 % of NNP ’s NN area has a bigger difference between the transient and quasi-equilibrium climates than between the Paris Agreement NN levels . This includes both slow - NN ocean areas , where the quasi-equilibrium 1.5 °C NN is warmer than a transient 2 °C NN , and continental land regions , where the transient 1.5 °C NN is warmer than a quasi-equilibrium 2 °C NN . For a typical location on NNP ’s NN , the absolute difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates is RB 40 % of the absolute difference between the Paris NN limits . The difference between transient and equilibrium climates extends to NN extremes . The probability ratio of moderate heat extremes 22 , such as CD - in - ten hot seasons ( Fig. 4a , b ) , shows broad regions where a heat event is twice as likely in the transient NN ( that is , a CD - in - five NN event instead ) compared with a quasi-equilibrium NN NN . This is particularly JJ in boreal summer where , for almost all land regions of the NN , the likelihood of a hot season is significantly higher in a transient NN compared with the equivalent quasi-equilibrium NN . Regions with at least a doubling in the probability of hot summers in a transient NN compared with a quasi-equilibrium NN of equivalent JJ NN encompass major cities including NNP NNP City , Istanbul , Baghdad , Seoul and Tokyo . Although this is a JJ - scale analysis , PRP MD infer that for these densely populated locations , the heat - related impacts of JJ - induced NN NN MD be lessened in a stabilized NN compared with a rapidly VBG NN at the same level of JJ NN . A similar pattern of results was VBN when examining cold extremes , with far fewer cold seasons ( below the 10th percentile extracted from the quasi- equilibrium NN ) in the transient NN NN in Northern Hemisphere land areas ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ) . Overlaying estimates of gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita20 show that poorer areas of the NN tend to experience greater probability of hot seasons in a transient NN than a quasi-equilibrium equivalent ( in DJF the correlation is − 0.39 , although in JJA it is negligible ) . There is a JJ benefit of NN stabilization in terms of reduced frequency of hot extremes relative to a rapidly VBG NN at the same JJ NN level , and this is particularly JJ for the developing NN , in which the likelihood of hot seasons is reduced NN - round . JJ analyses written for the IPCC SR1.5 have focused on understanding NNS in hot and cold extremes between the Paris Agreement JJ NN limits 8,23 , 24 . The results presented in this NN demonstrate that the difference in the frequency of hot and cold extremes between a transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NN at a given level of JJ NN is RB JJ for JJ populated regions of the NN . The frequency of hot summers in a NN where JJ - average NN rapidly passes through a JJ NN level relative to equilibrating at that level is substantially greater in the Middle East , much of Eurasia and northern Africa , and North NNP . Results from some studies of future extremes , such as ref. 23 , MD apply to transient 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer worlds , but MD probably represent substantial overestimates for NNS in the frequency of heat extremes for equilibrium 1.5 °C and 2 °C climates relative to the present . The comparison of RCP 8.5 and ECP4.5 simulations from a multi- model ensemble enabled us to isolate the effects of the transient and quasi-equilibrium nature of the JJ model experiments . This enabled us to address a fundamental question about the nature of the NNP ’s NN NN : what differences in NN MD we expect between transient and equilibrium warmer worlds for a given level of JJ NN ? This is a vitally important question in the context of international agreements such as the Paris Agreement , for which analyses VBG transient and equilibrium NN model experiments MD yield JJ results and lead to the formation of JJ conclusions and policy pathways . It is worth noting that some of the largest differences between transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NNS are identified for regions that are poorly observed and where model biases exist , such as the Southern Ocean25 . As a result , projections for the Southern Ocean should be treated with caution , although they generally align with our understanding of the NN system19 . Further discussion of the results for the Southern Ocean is provided in the Supplementary NN . The differences between transient and equilibrium NN NNS have important implications in impact modelling . For example , some empirical impact models , such as damage functions 26 , are VBN on JJ - average NN , but in reality PRP MD expect JJ JJ costs to occur between transient and equilibrium warmer worlds for both the globe as a whole26 and individual NNS 27 , especially developing NNS in the tropics , due to the JJ patterns of regional NN . Differences in methods VBN to simulate future climates and their impacts have the potential to lead to decision - makers receiving inadequate NN about the nature of possible future climates for their region of interest . This MD result in the development of ineffective policy , especially in building resilience for future extreme heat events , which is already more challenging in the developing world28 . JJ of our results suggest that the differences between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates are substantial . A future 1.5 °C or 2 °C quasi-equilibrium warmer NN reached after an overshoot ( that is , in NNS in which JJ NN has exceeded these limits but then fallen ) MD probably look very JJ to the equivalent transient 1.5 °C or 2 °C NN that the NN is likely to experience in the coming decades 29,30 . Indeed , a transient warmer NN represents a poor predictor for an equivalent equilibrium NN in JJ populated land regions where the difference in average seasonal NNS is at least 0.5 °C and the likelihood of hot extremes is at least twice as high in some places under the transient NN . Studies of the implications of future JJ NN must therefore be very clear in their framing of results with respect to the transience of the experiments VBN for their conclusions to be relevant for policy development . Current multi-model projection efforts , such as CMIP5 ( ref. 1 ) and the subsequent CMIP6 ( ref. 4 ) projects , do not incorporate experiments that explicitly address the needs of policy - makers following the Paris Agreement . Multi - model experiments that can be VBN to examine NN NN at stabilized 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer climates MD be invaluable in meeting the needs of decision - makers given that the Paris Agreement is implicitly targeting stabilized JJ NN levels12 and that we have demonstrated here that the rate of JJ NN has a JJ effect on the NN pattern across the globe . Although single - model experiments have been performed previously3 , these are not a substitute for multi- model projections that can more comprehensively examine the impacts of the Paris Agreement JJ NN levels . Our NN highlights the notable differences in model - simulated transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NNS . We find that these differences are significant and substantial across JJ regions of the NN , such that they must be considered in the design of both model studies on the implications of future JJ NN , and in the design of future multi- model experiments following CMIP5 and CMIP6 . Studies must be clear in the precise definition of NN targets and the framework given the differing implications of a given level of JJ NN depending on the transience of the NN NN ."

In the thirty NNS since , those projections of what MD happen in a VBG NN have proven to be remarkably prescient . “ We ’ve already observed some of the things we expected in 1989 , ” VBD Susan Fischer Wilhelm , a research manager at the California NNP Commission , the agency that compiled the report . The assessment laid the groundwork for what has arguably become the country ’s most ambitious effort to address JJ NN . But to JJ who worked on the report , looking back on it now only underscores how RB we ’ve waited to act — and how much NN has been wasted . “ I felt a sense of pride of being able to participate in something IN this , but RB a sense of regret for us as a society , ” VBD Les Baxter , who worked on the report as a policy analyst at the CEC and is now vice NN of program strategy for the Pew Charitable Trusts . “ We ’ve VBN what we VBP to do and we just keep refusing to do it . ” The report might have remained lost to history if Gary Estes had n’t been VBG through boxes in his garage last NN and stumbled upon a copy . For decades , Estes has organized the annual California Extreme Precipitation Symposium . And he decided to use this NN ’s meeting as an opportunity to look back at the 185 - page report . “ I thought it MD be an appropriate thing to do 30 NNS later , ” VBD Estes , a citizen activist and self - described “ NN nut . ” The symposium , held this week at UC Davis , brought together NN and NN NNS to discuss report ’s findings . Its NN - specific projections were drawn from scientific studies and assessments by the U.S. NNP Protection Agency that were released in the late 1980s , as well as from detailed analyses conducted by NN agencies . “ I was impressed with the level of rigor that they were able to bring , ” VBD Wilhelm , who gave a presentation at the symposium outlining what we knew then and what we VBP now . The report explained that doubling the concentration of NN dioxide in the atmosphere MD raise NNS in California by roughly 3 degrees Celsius — which will happen by mid-century if NNS continue to rise , according to the most recent California NNP NNP Assessment . Then , as now , NN models showed no clear NN in the NN ’s average annual precipitation . But the authors noted that 3 degrees of NN MD reduce the area of mountain snow cover by half . And it MD increase the frequency and severity of winter floods , as more NN fell as rain instead of snow . ( Both NNS have already started to occur , Wilhelm VBD . ) In contrast , spring runoff MD drop by a third . ( They ’ve already fallen over the last century , Wilhelm VBD . ) The authors added that , although there was still debate among NNS at the NN , NN NN MD RB bring more variable NN . The report outlined the ways in which NNS in the seasonal pattern of precipitation MD pose problems for the NN ’s reservoirs , which MD have to release NN during the rainy season to avoid overflowing . ( That ’s exactly what happened in the the 2017 Oroville Dam NN . ) In the summer , NN shortages MD impact ecosystems , farmers and hydropower production , the authors wrote . Heat and drought MD stress forests , which MD likely “ experience lower growth and higher susceptibility to fires , insects , and NN . ” ( This , too , has come to pass . ) The report RB warned that NN NN MD raise NN level , increase electricity demand , worsen air quality , increase heat - related deaths and be a drain on the NN ’s economy . “ It strikes me that we were RB on , ” VBD Kari Smith , now a division manager at the San Jose Clean NNP department who helped oversee the report when she worked at the CEC . “ I do n’t VB there was anything that we VBD that is radically off - base . ” If anything , she VBD , the report underestimated the degree to which NN impacts are interrelated . For instance , in 1989 , few foresaw that wildfire NN MD VB utilities to consider cutting NN to thousands of residents , jeopardizing the reliability of electricity . The report came about after the legislature asked the CEC to assess “ the effect of JJ NN trends on California ’s NN , economy , environment , agriculture , and NN . ” Soon after , the CEC released the NN ’s JJ inventory of NN gas NNS in 1990 and a set of NN policy recommendations in 1991 . AB 4420 , the 1988 NN that mandated the reports , was introduced by Byron Sher , a Stanford law professor and NN politician best VBN for authoring California ’s clean air and safe drinking NN acts . JJ NN had just begun to seep into the JJ consciousness . Alarmed by signs of JJ NN and the results of early NN models , NNS were VBG JJ with their concerns about what JJ then called the “ NN effect . ” Sher immediately saw the threat to California . “ The heat is on , ” he VBD the Sacramento Bee in 1989 . “ The NN can either ignore what NN is telling us or we can respond to this challenge in a responsible NN . ” Sher ’s NN was part of a flurry of bipartisan JJ activity on NN NN across the country . In his 1988 presidential campaign , George H.W. Bush vowed to combat the NN effect with “ the White NNP effect . ” In Congress , Democrats and Republicans introduced more than a dozen bills to curb atmospheric pollution . Several called for reducing NN gas NNS to 20 % below 1988 levels by the NN 2000 . ( IN the same NN , the NN agreed to phase out ozone - destroying substances under an agreement that NNP Reagan helped negotiate . ) By comparison , AB 4420 was relatively modest , VBD Kip Lipper , who was Sher ’s chief of staff and helped draft the NN . But AB 4420 had the distinction of actually passing . ( The assembly voted 58 to 13 in favor of the NN ; the senate voted 38-0 . “ It ’s the JJ law enacted anywhere in the NNP NNPS that VBD the term ‘ JJ NN , ’ ” VBD Lipper , who still serves as the chief policy advisor for NN and environment to the NN pro tem of the NN senate . Lipper VBD the report did n’t make a JJ splash . But it did provide a basis for everything that came later , including the NN ’s renewable NN portfolio standard and its cap - and - trade program . “ We tried to seed the ground , if you will , by saying , ‘ Let ’s just VB a report . Let ’s have this task force look at this , ” he VBD . It MD be 12 NNS before the next piece of NN legislation passed . And AB 32 — which set the NN ’s JJ NNS reduction target — did n’t become law until 2006 . The reasons for the slow response are familiar : the daunting scope of NN NN , the challenges of transitioning away from fossil fuels , and tenacious opposition by industry . But JJ VBP there was RB uncertainty about the reality of NN NN in the 1980s . While the report VBD that JJ NN posed a significant NN to California , it RB acknowledged that the matter was n’t entirely settled . In fact , the authors devoted six pages to “ Challenges to the NNP NNP Concept . ” Baxter felt that the NN was solid , but that there was n’t enough NN that it was happening yet . “ I remember thinking to myself , ‘ Well , we ’ll VB enough in 20 or 25 NNS , ’ ” he VBD . Such reservations made it hard for politicians to push for NN , RB if they cared deeply about JJ NN , Smith VBD . “ It was difficult to lead with NN NN for a JJ NN because it was considered maybe a little radical . ” Instead , leaders looked for ways to VB at NN mitigation by focusing on other objectives , IN improving air quality and NN efficiency . That was a start , but not enough to tackle the problem , she VBD . Today , NNS have no doubts about NN NN and Californians VBP the impacts all IN them . “ We now have observed NNS — not projections , nothing speculative — to show NN - related trends that are already affecting the NN in ways that were anticipated 30 NNS ago , ” Wilhelm VBD . Indeed , if the report ’s authors erred in any NN , it was that they did n’t anticipate just how fast these NNS MD occur . “ They thought that we had at least 100 NNS before it became existential , ” Smith VBD . “ Now , 30 NNS later , we ’re recognizing that it all happened a lot more quickly than we anticipated . ”"

To achieve this objective , JJ NNS should peak as soon as possible and NN neutrality should be achieved by the second half of the century . The EU supports these objectives : it aims to reduce its NN gas NNS by 80 - 95 % by 2050 compared with 1990 levels , and its Member NNPS each set and pursue national emission reduction targets . In the shorter term , the EU has set a target to reduce NN gas NNS levels by at least 40 % below 1990 levels by 2030 . NN gases are emitted through both natural processes and JJ activities . The primary natural NN gas in the atmosphere is NN vapour . However , JJ activities release JJ amounts of other NN gases , which increases their atmospheric concentration and enhances the NN effect , thus VBG the NN . The main sources of NN gases from JJ activities are : • burning of fossil fuels ( coal , oil and gas ) in electricity generation , transport , industry and households ( CO ) ; • land use NN and deforestation ( CO ) ; • land filling of waste ( methane from decomposition ) ; and Several EU initiatives aim to cut NN gas NNS . Having achieved its objectives under the Kyoto Protocol for the period from 2008 to 2012 , the EU adopted a target to reduce NN gas NNS further , to levels 20 % below those of 1990 by 2020 . To achieve this target , a cap was set for the EU NNPS Trading NNP ( ETS ) . For NNS in sectors not covered by the ETS , individual national targets were set under the Effort Sharing Decision . At the same NN , the EU has adopted legislation to increase the use of renewable NN , such as wind , solar , hydro and biomass , and to improve the NN efficiency of a wide array of equipment and household appliances . The EU RB aims to support the development of NN capture and storage technologies to trap and store CO emitted by NN stations and other JJ installations . As part of a framework of NN and NN policies , the EU has set a binding target to cut NNS in the EU territory by 2030 to levels at least 40 % below those in 1990 . NNS from land use , land - use NN and forestry have RB been incorporated into the EU ’s emission reduction efforts . The European NNP Union , which aims to ensure that Europe has secure , affordable and NN - friendly NN , reinforces this objective . By providing NN on NN NN in Europe and its Member NNPS , the EEA supports the implementation of European legislation on NN NN mitigation , the evaluation of EU policies and the development of JJ - term mitigation strategies . The EEA provides NNS , indicators , assessments and reports on NN gas NNS trends , projections , and policies and measures in Europe . The EEA works closely with EU institutions ( for example the European Commission ) , experts from its European Topic Centre on NNP NNP Mitigation and NNP ( ETC / CME ) and its environment NN and observation network ( Eionet ) .

In other words , rather than adopting policies and practices to slow the rise in JJ NNS , humanity is essentially continuing on the same suicidal course it ’s been on for decades . And , of course , NNP administration policies seeking ever more fossil fuel production in the U.S. are exactly opposite of what we VBP to do . The NNS Gap Report is the JJ U.N. effort to compare projected JJ NNS with the stated goals of the 2015 Paris agreement , in which NN governments acknowledged the looming danger and pledged to take steps to limit NNS of NN gases . The agreement , which aimed to limit the rise in JJ NNS to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels , was shepherded by the Obama administration ; NNP NNP ’s decision to withdraw from the pact MD leave the U.S. , despite its key role in forging the agreement , as a JJ outlier , the sole country not a party to it .

It RB builds on an earlier report that projects that RB if nations meet their current commitments under the Paris agreement NNS MD still rise somewhere between 3 and 4 degrees Celsius .

There is no easy NN to fix this , but there are some pretty clear steps that MD be taken , including dropping tax breaks and subsidies for the fuels that are imperiling us , thus letting NN prices more accurately reflect the JJ cost ; changing the NN itself by VBG NN policies , including NN taxes , to push a rapid JJ transition to renewable NN ; and helping developing nations whose demands for NN are growing to build renewable NN infrastructures that do not rely on fossil fuels . And we must do this with a sense of urgency , and without deluding ourselves about the fate that awaits us if we do not ."

See_VB photos_NNS of_IN how_WRB global_JJ warming_NN threatens_VBZ penguins_NNS ._.","It 's become as much a winter tradition as eggnog at Christmas and champagne on NNP NNP 's Eve  the JJ major snowstorm of the NN bringing out the NN - VB skeptics . And the bona fide blizzard that has frozen much of the Northeast just a few days after winter officially began definitely qualifies as major . But while piles of snow blocking your driveway hardly conjure images of a dangerously VBG NN , it does n't mean that NN NN is a myth . The NNP Meteorological Organization recently reported that 2010 is almost certainly VBG to be CD of the three warmest NNS on record , while 2001 to 2010 is already the hottest decade in recorded history . Indeed , according to some NNS , all of these events MD actually be connected . CD NN is that a warmer Arctic MD actually lead to colder and snowier winters in the northern mid-latitudes . RB as NNS IN Britain  suffering through the coldest December on record  deal with low NNS and unusual snow , the Arctic has kept on NN , with Greenland and Arctic Canada experiencing the hottest NN on record . NNS in that region have been 5.4 °F to 7.2 °F ( 3 °C to 4 °C ) above normal in 2010 . As a result , the Arctic sea-ice cover has continued to shrink ; this September , the minimum summer sea-ice extent was more than 770,000 sq. mi. ( 2 CD sq km ) below the JJ - term average , and the third - smallest on record . Snow MD be piling up in midtown Manhattan , but the Arctic is continuing its JJ - term meltdown . The loss of Arctic NN NN helps accelerate the NN of the atmosphere in the far north , thanks to what 's VBN as the albedo effect . White NN reflects sunlight into NN , cooling the air , but when NN melts and is replaced with dark ocean NN , the effect is reversed and more of the NN 's heat is absorbed . As the Arctic air warms , it raises the altitude of discrete areas of high pressure , which can then alter wind patterns . This , in turn , can weaken the jet stream , allowing more cold air to seep out of the Arctic and into Europe and the eastern U.S. As the authors of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's recent "" Arctic Report Card "" put it , "" There is NN that the effect of higher air NNS in the lower Arctic atmosphere in fall is contributing to NNS in the atmospheric circulation in both the Arctic and northern mid-latitudes . Winter 2009 - 2010 showed a JJ connectivity between mid-latitude extreme cold and snowy NN events and NNS in the wind patterns of the Arctic ; the so - called Warm Arctic Cold Continents pattern . "" The NN seems counterintuitive , but as Jeff Masters , a meteorologist who writes the great Wunder Blog at NNP Underground , put it in a recent post , it makes sense : "" This pattern is kind of IN leaving the refrigerator door ajar  the refrigerator warms up , but all the cold air spills out into the NN . "" The NN overall is still VBG  and the Arctic fastest of all  but the cold air from the far north can result in biting winter NN and major storms , for a while at least . That 's not the only NN . Judah Cohen , the director of seasonal forecasting at the JJ research firm AER , has written that increasing seasonal snow cover in Siberia MD drive extreme winter NN . RB as the NN has continued to warm and the Arctic has melted , seasonal snow cover has increased in Siberia , especially north of high Asian mountain ranges IN the Himalayas . ( As the NN warms overall , the atmosphere can hold more moisture , which can lead to more precipitation  falling as snow in places IN Siberia that remain relatively cold . ) All that Siberian snow creates a dome of cold air near the mountains , which bends the passing jet stream . Instead of flowing west to east , the jet stream moves in a more north to south fashion , carrying cold air south from the Arctic in the eastern U.S. and in Europe . Cohen 's NN is n't accepted by all NN and NN NNS , but the National NNP Foundation has VBN that in past NNS his model has predicted winter NN more accurately than traditional forecasts . Of course , it 's important to remember that NN is n't the same as NN  a single storm , or RB a single cold winter , can tell us little about the overall NN . Anomalies do happen , and sometimes they dump 20 inches ( 50 cm ) of snow on Central Park . The systems that govern NN on this NN are incredibly complex , and our ability to understand why individual events occur  and to forecast them for the future  is still imperfect . That more than anything is what drives  and distorts  so much of the stubborn debate over NN NN . Just because NN models predict that the NN will continue to heat up in the future as we continue to pour NN - gas NNS into the atmosphere does n't mean that NN will be a steady , RB process . Far from it  and as parts of the NN warm far faster than others , extreme events , including winter ones , MD become more common . JJ Yorkers cursing NNP Gore as they dig out their cars should recall this past July  the second hottest month on record in the city . Unfortunately , that unpredictability is VBG to make adapting to a warmer NN RB tougher . As NN NN appears to trigger harsher winter events in parts of the NN , that 's not an effect that will last forever . As the NN warms , RB cold air from the Arctic or Siberia MD not be enough to offset the NN effect , and major snowstorms IN the NN the Northeast just experienced MD be a thing of the past . That might make for less snow shoveling  but on the whole , it wo n't be a very pleasant NN to live on . VB photos of how JJ NN threatens penguins ."

Adapting to NN NN will be necessary regardless of how much we manage to cut our NNS , as historic NNS have already changed our NN and will continue to do so in decades to come . The NNP NNP ( Scotland ) Act 2009 placed a duty on ministers to lay a programme for NN NN NN before the Scottish Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the UK NNP NNP NNP Assessment ( UKCCRA ) , the latest of which includes a summary report for Scotland . The Act RB requires an annual report on progress and for the advisory body , the Committee for NNP NNP NNP Sub Committee ( ASC ) , to prepare a report within CD NNS , setting out its independent assessment of the progress made on objectives , proposals and policies set out in the programme . The second Scottish NNP NNP NNP Programme ( SCCAP ) to VB prepare for the impact of NN NN was launched in September 2019 . It addresses the risks set out in the UK NNP NNP NNP Assessment ( UK CCRA ) 2017 , published under section 56 of the UK NNP NNP Act 2008 . The SCCAP ’s outcomes - VBN approach is derived from both the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Scotland ’s National Performance Framework . The programme has been aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals to ensure it complements our international ambitions . Its launch coincided with a NNP Nations NNP NNP summit in NNP NNP . The JJ SCCAP was launched in NNP 2014 , with the aim of increasing the resilience of Scotland 's NNS , environment and economy to the impacts of a changing NN . The ASC 's JJ independent assessment of the JJ SCCAP recognised the SCCAP as a positive start in taking steps to prepare for NN NN . The final assessment of the JJ SCCAP was published in March 2019 and VBD that there had been notable progress since the JJ assessment , but there was still some continuing concern and gaps remaining in key NN and NNS , which it expected to be considered in the second SCCAP . We have published annual progress reports since 2015 . The JJ annual progress report on the second SCCAP was published in NNP 2020 and can be viewed below : The annual progress reports on the JJ SCCAP can be accessed as follows : We fund NNP Scotland to provide advice and support to VB organisations , businesses and communities adapt to the impacts of NN NN . Key achievements so far , as Scotland adapts to NN NN , include : • a report mapping areas in Scotland most at NN of flooding As with the JJ SCCAP , the NNP Committee of the Committee on NNP NNP will undertake assessments of the 2019 - 2024 programme during its lifetime . The Committee on NNP NNP is now working on an updated NN report , due to be published in summer 2021 , which will inform the third UK CCRA ( VBN as CCRA3 ) to be published in 2022 , which will in turn inform the third Scottish NNP NNP NNP Programme , due in 2024 ."

It ’s NN in the same NN the most popular boys ’ baby names are NN . ( Wow , dear , did you VB James won again ? ) The NN scientist Joseph Majkut quipped that the tone of this NN ’s announcement was less “ VB , VB we VBD you ” and more “ Well , duh . ” Schmidt , the NNP scientist , nodded at this during the briefing . “ The fact is , the NN is VBG , and every NN we add CD extra NNS point to this graph , which MD not seem IN a terribly important thing , but NNS seem interested , ” he VBD . “ The main thing here is not the ranking … but the consistency of the JJ - term trend we ’re seeing . ” Virtually every important NN record has been broken and re-broken over the past few NNS : The past five NNS are the five warmest NNS on record , the past six the warmest six , the past nine the warmest nine . Since Donald NNP rode down his gilded escalator and announced he was running for NN , the NN has experienced its hottest recorded version of each individual month , according to NOAA . So it ’s worth VBG back in history to VB just how outlandish our current situation is . The median NNP is a little more than 38 NNS old . The NN before she was born was 1980 . It was , at the NN , the hottest NN ever measured . A July heat wave that NN killed 1,265 Americans and caused more than $ 20 CD in damage nationwide . The larger significance of this milestone was not well understood at the NN . In an op - ed that summer , a weatherman in Westchester , NNP NNP , expressed so much regret about giving in and buying a car with an air conditioner that he wondered whether Americans of his demographic were “ less tolerant of extreme heat than our NNS and grandparents . ” His NNS ’ generation made do without air - conditioned cars , he figured , and his grandparents did n’t RB have electric ceiling fans . Were they a tougher breed ? They were not , he learned : The NN had gotten warmer . He was shocked . “ It came as a great surprise to discover that during the JJ three decades of this century there were fewer heat waves ( 27 ) than during the last three ( 49 ) , ” he wrote in The NNP NNP Times . “ My hat is off to the present generation … If we create our own cooler environment with air conditioners , well then , we deserve it . ” His editorial did not mention JJ NN or “ the NN effect , ” as it was then called . And the hottest - NN record probably did seem IN a fluke : 1980 was the JJ NN the record had been broken in 35 NNS . In 1981 , the median NNP was born , a happy and healthy statistical girl . The NN inched RB hotter , setting a JJ all - NN record a few hundredths of a degree Celsius warmer than 1980’s . Then , in 1983 , as she learned to string sentences together , the record was smashed again . The JJ hottest - NN record had now been broken three times in four NNS ."

A JJ survey reveals CD in five NNS are having bad dreams about the JJ NNS , with 17 percent reporting their concerns are affecting their sleeping and eating habits . The poll RB shows 80 percent VB the problem was important to them and nearly half do not trust adults to tackle the JJ - term problems . The NN , conducted by BBC Newsround in collaboration with Savanta - ComRes , surveyed 2,000 NNS in the UK from the ages of eight to 16 in a bid to VB just how the younger generation feels about the NNS to our NN . Over the past NN , millions of young NNS have flooded the streets of cities IN the NN demanding JJ leaders take urgent steps to stop NN NN , inspired by 17 - NN - old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg . The BBC Newsround conducted the JJ survey to VB understand how the young generation feels about the impact NN NN MD have on their future . The poll VBD that 73 percent of the participants are in constant worry about the NN 's current NN , including 22 percent who are ' very worried ' . JJ adults have noted that the disastrous effects MD not become a reality for JJ NNS , but it seems our NNS MD be the ones to suffer the consequences . Almost three in five , about 58 percent , of NNS are concerned about what NN NNS means for their future . And approximately CD percent shared they are having nightmares about the NN NN . When questioned about the NN being taken by grown - ups to tackle the problem , a JJ number of NNS VBD they feel frustrated about the progress being made . Emma Citron , a consultant clinical NN psychologist , VBD that young NNS often find it difficult to come to terms with the scale of the problem of NN NNS and what often seems IN a lack of response shown by governments and NN leaders . ' JJ figures IN David Attenborough and Greta Thunberg have helped young NNS to voice their worries and we have to make sure that we as adults listen to them and ... VB them become involved in positive NN , ' she VBD in a statement . ' We all VBP to support them not to feel hopeless but rather to present to them hopeful and balanced messages about their futures and ensure that they VBP the JJ professional NN if their anxiety is unduly high . ' The NNP Psychological Association has VBN it was aware of reports of growing ' eco-anxiety ' in NNS , but research was needed to establish how common it was . Britain's Oxford Dictionaries recorded a 4,290 percent increase in the term ' eco-anxiety ' in 2019 , particularly among young NNS . In September 2019 , millions of NNS including hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren took to the streets in 150 JJ NNS for the largest NN protest in history . NNP Strike 4 NNP NNP ' protesters were photographed in Australia , Indonesia , the Philippines , India , Bangladesh , Uganda , Kenya , the Solomon Island , Cyprus , Poland , Germany and London and those living in NNP joined later in the day . The protests were part of a snowballing movement sparked by teenage activist Greta Thunberg 's school strikes outside the Swedish parliament . It came ahead of a NN NN summit in NNP NNP convened by UN secretary general Antonio Guterres to urge NNS to up their NN efforts . Much steeper measures are needed across the globe to prevent NN rises of more than 1.5C ( 2.7 F ) or 2C ( 3.6 F ) to avoid the worst impacts of NN NN . Newsround is a BBC NN bulletin produced specifically for NNS which often features reports about NN NN ."

Email_NN :_: [_-LRB- email_NN protected_VBN ]_-RRB-","Despite the Internet , connectivity , and linking technologies , distance has not shrunk the Australian sense of self , an often provincial appraisal of the NN seen in slow motion and stills . Whether it ’s the “ flower revolution ” or Michel Foucault , trends and ideas are often delayed , and seem almost cutely anachronistic by the NN they make landfall down under . Wedded to the insatiable urge to reap , rent and remove from the NN , and you have the ultimate myopic : Australia , the exceptional country , outside the stream of history and , dare it be VBN , the inconveniences of NN . With some 11,000 NNS warning that NN NNP “ clearly and unequivocally faces a NN emergency ” , some sense of it was registered on the Australian JJ scene , if only barely . The “ NNP NNPS ’ Warning of a NN Emergency ” published in BioScience does not shy away from the language of catastrophe and emergency . “ Despite 40 NNS of JJ NN negotiations … we have generally conducted business as usual and have largely failed to address this predicament . ” NN NN had not merely arrived but bulldozed itself into recognition , “ accelerating faster than JJ NNS expected . ” The authors and signatories suggest that , “ An immense increase of scale in endeavours to conserve our biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to the NN NN . ” JJ debates on the subject of NN NN had mostly focused on JJ NN NN , a clearly inadequate approach that avoids “ the breath of JJ activities and the real dangers stemming from a VBG NN . ” Areas of urgent redress were RB suggested . NN efficiency and a reduction in the use of fossil fuels are high on the list . “ We VBP a NN - free economy that explicitly addresses JJ dependence on the biosphere and policies that guide JJ decisions accordingly . ” The call for a NN of language is encouraged : rhetoric of GDP growth and affluence needs to be replaced by sustainability “ and improving JJ well - being by prioritizing basic needs and reducing inequality . ” Not exactly music for the muscular fossil fuel lobby . Another song sheet that MD not have impressed the fossil fuel industries was an event that barely disturbed the press releases . This month , the National Electricity NNP in Australia received a contribution from wind , solar and hydro NN amounting to half of the total NN production . Rooftop solar contributions came in at 23.7 percent , with wind ( 15.7 percent ) , JJ - scale solar ( 8.8 percent ) and hydro ( 1.9 percent ) bringing up the rear . With the release of the report , Australia braced itself for the incinerating fury of bush fires that have arrived earlier this season . The NN of NNP South Wales is anticipating what the Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons describes as “ the most dangerous bushfire week this nation has ever seen ” . The warnings were already pressing through the policy pipeline in the last decade . The National Inquiry on Bushfire Mitigation and Management ’s 2004 report to the Council of Australian NNP warned that , “ Fires ’ frequency , intensity and size are expected to increase under NN NN as NNS rise , rainfall variability increases , droughts become more severe and ecosystem dynamics alter , resulting in changed biomass fuel loads and types . ” The authors of the report VBP on to suggest that “ projected hotter , drier and windier conditions associated with NN NN caused by NN NN MD extend the period of fuel drying and increase rates of fire spread . ” Earlier this NN , JJ NSW Fires Chief Greg Mullins and 22 other emergency honchos warned Prime Minister Morrison of the dangers that MD face Australia this summer , suggesting that the NN meet to discuss some form of NN against risks of conflagration . The meeting has yet to take place , leaving such politicians as Adam Bandt , the Greens MP for Melbourne , certain that Morrison “ bears some responsibility and must apologise to the communities impacted ” . Various Australian politicians , as then , were having none of it . Charged with the task of keeping a plunderer ’s lifestyle in perpetuity , the well - fed pigs in clover , the following words of the BioScience report sit uncomfortably with members of the Morrison NN . “ The NN NN is closely linked to excessive consumption of the wealthy lifestyle . The most affluent NNS are mainly responsible for the historical GHG NNS and generally have the greatest per capita NNS . ” The Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack preferred some tea and sympathy in responding to the victims of the fires , not policy and prognosis . “ They do n’t VB the ravings of some pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies at this NN when they are trying to save their homes . ” McCormack ’s primary target was the Green party itself , which he accused of fiddling politically while Australia burned . “ That ’s what Adam Bandt , and the Greens , and Richard Di Natale , and all those other inner-city raving lunatics – and quite frankly , that ’s how he was carrying on yesterday – that ’s what they VBP , we ’re not VBG to VB down that path . ” Other politicians have adopted a similar approach : the now is what matters , and never VBP previous failings and future disasters . NSW Premier Gladys Berejikilian provided the stellar example . “ For any of us on the ground , speaking to NNS traumatised , speaking to NNS fighting fires for weeks … VB exactly what the priorities should be , and that is saving NN and property ” . NN NN , in other words , was something for another day , another slot in the packed meeting schedule . Morrison reiterated the position . He was “ focused on the needs of the NNS ” . He spoke of having “ firefighters out there saving someone else ’s NN while their own NN is burning down , and when we are in that sort of situation , that is where attention must be . ” Mayors from the areas most affected by the recent conflagration have been crankily unimpressed by the platitudes . NN NN literature , they surmise , is being assiduously avoided by the NN . The unfortunately named Carol Sparks , Mayor of Glen Innes , site of CD deaths over the weekend , suggested that McCormack needed “ to read the NN , and that is what I am VBG by , is the NN . ” Forget , suggested the mayor , the politics here . NN had imposed its cold , objective hand on the matter . Mid Coast Mayor Claire Pontin was similarly riled , notably by suggestions that fires were the staple of Australian NN and landscape . “ We ’ve not had situations IN that . Fifty NNS ago , this MD never happen . ” There are few incentives for humanity to adapt than through the infliction of catastrophic conditions . Pandemics , NN wars and existential NN have done their bit in propelling NN . But luxury produces complacency ; well fed bellies induce sloth . Come the writing of humanity ’s extensive biography of preying on the NN , Australia and its JJ classes will have much to answer for .

Passing the alarming milestones means "" we are in a NN of planetary emergency "" that MD VB humanity wiped from the NN . So much damage has been done in the nine outlined areas that the effects of JJ NN MD accelerate and create a deadly domino effect , researchers wrote in the journal Nature . Points of no return picked out by the team include the loss of the Amazon rainforest and the great NN sheets of Antarctica and Greenland – damage from which our NN MD never recover . "" A decade ago we identified a suite of potential tipping points in the NNP NN , "" VBD lead author Professor Tim Lenton , from the NNP of Exeter . "" Now we VBP NN that over half of them have been activated . "" The team , made up of top researchers from the UK , Germany , Denmark and Australia , VBD urgent NN was needed to reduce NNS before further milestones are passed . "" The growing threat of rapid , irreversible NNS means it is no longer responsible to wait and VB , "" Professor Lenton VBD . "" The situation is urgent and we VBP an emergency response . "" A tipping point is reached when certain impacts of JJ NN become unstoppable , such as heavy NN loss in Antarctica . Among the nine tipping points outlined by NNS were thawing of permafrost in NNP , JJ - scale die - offs of coral and a slowdown of ocean currents in the Atlantic . Droughts in the Amazon rainforest and fires in the far north of Canada and NNP were RB VBN to be key crossroads identified a decade ago that are now "" active "" . Due to the NN our NN 's ecosystem is connected , as each tipping point is reached , others not currently active are pushed closer to the brink . "" It is not only JJ pressures on NNP that continue rising to unprecedented levels , "" VBD NN coauthor Professor Johan Rockström , of the Potsdam Institute in Germany . "" As NN advances , we must admit that we have underestimated the risks of unleashing irreversible NNS , where the NN self - amplifies JJ NN . "" This cascade of NNS sparked by JJ NN MD threaten the existence of JJ civilisations , according to the researchers . The collapse of major NN sheets on Greenland and Antarctica alone MD drive NN levels up by CD metres , turfing millions in coastal areas from their homes . NNS to Atlantic currents have already triggered more frequent and destructive hurricanes across the western NN . In the past , it was thought that the NN MD VB to heat up by 5C for NNP 's tipping points to be reached . However , NN shows we have already started to hit them between 1C and 2C . NNP has heated by RB 1C since pre-industrial NNS , a figure that is certain to rise in the coming decades . "" Scientifically , this provides strong NN for declaring a NN of planetary emergency , "" Professor Rockström added . "" We must unleash NN NN that accelerates the path towards a NN that can continue evolving on a stable NN . "" Nearly 200 NNS signed the 2015 Paris Agreement , pledging to keep JJ NN below 2C . However , current national NNS pledges – RB if they are met – MD lead to 3C of NN . Experts argued that further international NN was needed , as it MD slow the impacts of NN NN , giving more NN for NNS to adapt . Professor Lenton added : "" We might already have crossed the threshold for a cascade of inter-related tipping points . "" However , the rate at which they progress , and therefore the NN they pose , can be reduced by cutting our NNS . "" His team concluded in their paper : "" If damaging tipping cascades can occur and a JJ tipping cannot be ruled out , then this is an existential threat to civilisation . "" "" A saving grace is that the rate at which damage accumulates from tipping MD still be under our NN to some extent . "" The stability and resilience of our NN is in peril . International NN – not just words – must reflect this . "" In other NN , shocking photos this week revealed how Swiss glaciers have nearly disappeared since the 1800s . Seaside towns were recently urged by experts to "" move inland "" as NN NN meant a retreat was needed . And , this NN level "" doomsday "" simulator reveals whether your home MD be wiped out by rising oceans . Are you worried about NN NN ? Let us VB in the comments ! We pay for your stories !

The associated JJ NN and humidification , increases in the severity and frequency of extreme NN events , extension of the ranges of vector ‐borne diseases , and the consequent JJ and JJ stresses and disruption will have major negative consequences on JJ aspects of NN care . NNS whose resilience to NN is already impaired MD suffer disproportionately from these JJ NNS , which are of unprecedented reach and magnitude . There has been little connection made so far between NN NN and epilepsy . We briefly review the history of NN NN NN and the subsequent response of the JJ scientific community . We consider how NN NN effects might in general affect NN and NN . We consider some of the underlying complex interactions that , for example , favor the spread of vector ‐borne diseases and how NN models operate and MD VB plan for JJ and local NNS . We then speculate specifically on how these generic ideas MD apply specifically to epilepsy . We consider these impacts at levels from molecular to the epidemiological . NNS are sparse , and there is undoubtedly a NN for more NN to enable better estimation of possible effects of NN NN on care in epilepsy . We RB consider how the professional activities of those involved in epilepsy NN care might contribute to JJ NN NNS , for example , through flying for conference attendance . Healthcare organizations across the NN are already considering , and responding to , JJ of these issues . We argue for more research in this area , but RB for NN today . Actions today are likely to generate cobenefits for NN care , including care in epilepsy , resulting from efforts to decarbonize , mitigate effects of NN NN that has already happened , and plan for NN to NN NN . NN NN , dominated by NN NN , is accepted by the majority of informed authorities as a clear feature of the Anthropocene era , and is becoming the lived experience shared by JJ of us globally , as we comment with increasing frequency about the unseasonal NN and the environment transforming IN us . The effects of NN NN will be pervasive , with no sphere of JJ endeavor likely to be untouched . As the 5th assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) VBZ : “ Continued emission of NN gases will VB further NN and JJ ‐lasting NNS in all components of the NN NN , increasing the likelihood of severe , pervasive and irreversible impacts for NNS and ecosystems . Limiting NN NN MD require substantial and sustained reductions in NN gas NNS which , together with NN , can limit NN NN risks . ” 1 The risks to JJ NN posed by NN NN have already received extensive attention . The fourth edition , published in 2018 , of the Lancet Countdown on NN and NN NN stated NN NN was “ the biggest JJ NN threat of the 21st century , ” warning that failure to take NN MD lead to disasters that “ disrupt core JJ NN infrastructure and overwhelm NN services . ” 2 A further Lancet commission report details the interaction between significant healthcare challenges ( a “ syndemic ” ) , working as multipliers that exacerbate unitary JJ challenges , such as obesity , undernutrition , and NN NN . 3 Several authorities and organizations have launched programs IN the effects of NN NN . The NNP NNP and NNP Alliance , formed in 2011 , “ works to tackle NN NN and to protect and promote JJ NN ” and provides useful links and resources ( http://climateandhealthalliance.org/). Several international groups , nations , and regions have their own healthcare initiatives focused on NN NN , such as the NNP Society Consortium on NNP and NNP in the NNP NNPS ( https://medsocietiesforclimatehealth.org/), the UK NNP Alliance on NNP NNP ( http://www.ukhealthalliance.org/), Doctors for the Environment Australia ( https://www.dea.org.au/), the Regional Institute of NNP Medicine and Research ( Rajasthan , India ) ( http://www.rihmr.org/), the European Environment and NNP Youth Coalition ( http://www.eehyc.org/), and the UK NHS ( https://www.sduhealth.org.uk/policy-strategy/reporting/nhs-carbon-footprint.aspx), NN NNS from which are estimated to account for between 4 % and 6 % of the total UK NN footprint . The NNP NNP Organization has made clear the NN benefits of mitigating NN NN far outweigh the costs . 4 The US healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente announced in 2018 that it MD become NN neutral by 2020.5 Funders are increasingly supporting research into the NN effects of NN NN , typically with a focus on mitigation strategies . It seems unlikely that any JJ NN area will escape the pervasive anticipated and unforeseen consequences of NN NN . Noting that the epilepsies are strongly influenced by JJ factors , we wished to start to consider how NN NN might affect the epilepsies , to raise awareness within the epilepsy community of these issues , and to facilitate and promote efforts by NNS affected by epilepsy , families and carers , and epilepsy professionals , to begin to address what NN we can take . Individuals MD already be taking steps in their own private lives , for example , by working out their own NN footprint ( https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/ ‐ a very easy to use and enlightening tool ) and taking effective actions . 6 Patients , clinicians , and NNS across the NN , as a community , MD have ideas and initiatives for shared observations and mitigation measures to reduce the potential added burden of NN NN for those with epilepsy . We here consider the history of NN NN , review the current NN of NN and JJ efforts to tackle NN NN , describe how NN NN can affect JJ NN and NN , and then address the particular impacts there MD be on the epilepsies , how NN care in the epilepsies might contribute to NN NN , what can be done to mitigate the effects , and how progress might be achieved . 2 NN NN : A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE HISTORY AND CURRENT STATUS NN NN NN has a much longer history than most NNS realize , dating back to the 19th century when Joseph Fourier recognized that the NNP 's atmosphere kept the NN warmer than MD be the NN in a vacuum . He effectively discovered the NN effect : the passage of visible light waves through the atmosphere to the NN 's NN , their absorption , and re‐emission as infrared radiation , which can then be absorbed by certain types of gases in the atmosphere , increasing NN NNS . Eunice Newton Foote was the JJ to suggest that the NN effect of the NN MD be increased in the presence of NN dioxide ( CO : then called “ carbonic acid ” ) . Her work was presented by Professor Joseph Henry at the NNP Association for the Advancement of NNP meeting in August 1856 . John Tyndall then examined the absorption of infrared radiation in JJ gases , discovering the NN gases ( GHG ) CO , methane , and NN vapor in 1859 . Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius was the JJ to link JJ activity to JJ NN . In 1896 , he published “ On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the NNP of the NNP , ” calculating that a doubling of atmospheric CO ( now called the “ NN sensitivity ” ) MD give a total NN of 5 ‐6 °C . In later work , he revised this downward to 4°C.7 This is not dissimilar to the range reported by the IPCC ’s 5th Assessment Report from the latest generation of JJ NN models . Events then jump almost 100 NNS to the modern era when the JJ conference on NN NN , a joint NNP Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) / NNP Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) / International Council for NNP ( ICSU ) Conference on the "" Assessment of the Role of NNP Dioxide and Other NNP Gases in NNP Variations and Associated Impacts , "" in 1985 concluded that GHG "" are expected "" to VB significant NN in the next century . This led to the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) in 1988 , whose role is to “ assess the scientific , technical and socio‐economic NN relevant for the understanding of the NN of human‐induced NN NN , ” and the NNP Nations Framework Convention on NNP NNP ( UNFCCC ) , an international JJ treaty adopted on NNP 9 , 1992 . The IPCC has issued a series of Assessment Reports once every 5 ‐6 NNS — published in 1990 ( NNP Assessment Report : FAR ) , 1995 ( Second Assessment Report : SAR ) , 2001 ( Third Assessment Report : TAR ) , 2007 ( Fourth Assessment Report : AR4 ) , and 2013 / 2014 ( Fifth Assessment Report : AR5 ) — and supplemental and special topic reports that describe the NN of scientific understanding at the NN each report is prepared . Although there have now been five Assessment Reports ( and the 6th is under construction ) , the range of potential NN with a doubling of atmospheric CO has not changed substantially from the estimate made with quite simple NN models in the FAR , or indeed by Arrhenius in 1896 , with both the FAR and AR5 suggesting a range from 1.5 to 4.5°C . Alongside this , the UNFCCC objective is to "" stabilize NN gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that MD prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the NN NN . "" The framework sets nonbinding limits on GHG NNS for individual NNS , with no enforcement mechanisms . An annual Conference of the Parties ( COP ) assesses progress in dealing with NN NN , and these have occurred since 1995 , with JJ producing specific international treaties ( “ agreements ” or “ protocols ” ) IN GHG NNS . This history includes ( a ) the Kyoto protocol — a legally binding agreement that industrialized NNS will reduce their NNS of GHGs , adopted in 1997 in Kyoto , Japan ; ( b ) the Copenhagen Accord ( 2009 ) , which recognized NN NN as CD of the greatest challenges of the present day and suggested actions should be taken to keep NN increases to below 2 °C ; however , the document was not legally binding and does not contain any binding commitments for reducing CO NNS ; ( c ) the Durban Platform ( 2011 ) , which included a decision to adopt a legally binding treaty on NN NN ; the treaty terms were to be set out by 2015 and become effective in 2020 and for the JJ NN , it included developing NNS and the NNP NNPS ; and ( d ) the Paris Agreement ( 2015 ) was a NN NN accord agreed by ~200 NNS in December 2015 that came into force on November 4 , CD , committing NN leaders to keeping JJ NN below 2 °C and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5°C . NN emission curbs are not legally binding , but the framework of the accord , including a mechanism for periodically increasing pledges , is binding . Since the FAR , the understanding of JJ influence on NN has improved through better NN observations and NN NN modeling , with the AR5 stating that : ( a ) “ NN of the NN NN is unequivocal , and since the 1950s , JJ of the observed NNS are unprecedented over decades to millennia "" 8 ; ( b ) "" Atmospheric concentrations of NN dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800 CD NNS "" 8 ; and ( c ) “ JJ influence on the NN NN is clear … It is extremely likely ( 95% ‐100 % probability ) that JJ influence was the dominant NN of JJ NN between 1951 ‐2010 . ” 8 Special reports such as the recent SR159 ( JJ NN of 1.5 °C ) examined the difference in impacts between 1.5 and 2 °C NN , suggesting that limiting NN to 1.5 °C “ is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so MD require unprecedented NNS ” with “ ‘ rapid and far ‐reaching ’ transitions in land , NN , industry , buildings , transport , and cities . ” A 1.5 °C limit MD require JJ net anthropogenic CO NNS to decline by about 45 % from 2010 levels by 2030 , reaching net zero IN 2050 . To limiting JJ NN to below 2°C , CO NNS will VB to decline by about 20 % by 2030 and reach net zero IN 2075 . We are already living in a 1 °C warmer NN . The SR159 NNS “ we are already seeing the consequences of 1 °C of JJ NN through more extreme NN , rising NN levels and diminishing Arctic NN NN , among other NNS … By 2100 , JJ NN level rise MD be CD cm lower with JJ NN of 1.5 °C compared with 2 °C , ” ; and moreover , “ JJ NN is likely to reach 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate ( high confidence ) . ” If we continue on our current emission trajectory , then we are likely to reach 2.6‐4.8 °C NN by 2100 , with recent modeling results suggesting that the higher NN sensitivities MD be more likely . In terms of personal emission targets , average personal NNS in 2010 were RB 5 tons per person and to reach the 2 °C target MD require reduction to RB 1.5 tons by 2050.10 This is very ambitious and of is of course VBN on an equal sharing of NNS across the JJ population . In reality , the rich , Westernized nations use much more NN per person than the poorer nations . CD There is the potential for major reduction in personal NN footprints in the Western NN typically by reducing the major contributors of car travel , heating , electricity use , and flying . Existing variability in NN influences JJ NN . For example , during clear summer days there is an increased occurrence of sunburn and Lyme NN , while during the winter , there is increased influence of influenza and falls . As NN NN will influence NN , particularly NN extremes , then impacts on JJ NN are likely . Hence , there has been an interest in the likely influence of NN NN on JJ NN for over 30 NNS , with a significant body of work now available on the NN impacts of NN NN . 11 - 15 NN NN MD lead to multiple NN impacts acting through a variety of JJ pathways , as shown conceptually in Figure 1 . Pathways through which NN NN MD influence NN . NN NN will affect mean NN , such as rainfall amounts and NN . In addition to changing average conditions , it MD RB increase variability and extremes ( eg , more intense rainfall events ) . The latter is probably of most consequence for JJ NN . Although globally , interannual NN has not increased in variability , 16 there is NN of regional NNS in extremes , 17,18 as both the mean NN and NN variability shift in response to anthropogenic forcings ( Figure 2 ) . These shifts in NN will be moderated by local JJ conditions and JJ NN , leading to NNS in three broad categories of exposure that have the potential to influence NN . The JJ are direct effects such as the influence of a heatwave upon mortality . CD The second are indirect exposures such as changing NN altering the growing season and distribution of plants , affecting pollen production , which in turn impacts on allergic disease20 ; other examples include changing NN patterns affecting mosquito breeding and NN cycles , leading to NNS in malaria and dengue fever ( VB below ) . 21 NNS in NN and humidity alter the geography of vector ‐borne diseases , by shifting vector breeding sites22 and altering the transmission windows of vector ‐borne diseases . 23 In JJ NNS , more NNS are needed to characterize the relationships between vector , pathogen , and NN . 24,25 Third , NN NN MD act through JJ and JJ disruption , for example , leading to mental NN effects from extreme events such as flooding26 or influencing JJ crop yields leading to increased hunger . 27 Flooding , whether coastal , fluvial , or pluvial , carries direct risks of drowning28 as well as a range of NN risks in the aftermath of the event , including the spread of NN ‐borne diseases , 29 and the spread of microbial contaminants in buildings . 30 The NN of exacerbating existing JJ conditions , through disrupted access to medicines and JJ facilities , is RB a concern . Schematic showing the effect on extreme NNS when ( A ) the mean NN increases , ( B ) the variance increases , and ( C ) when both the mean and variance increase for a normal distribution of NN However , changing exposure to extreme NN does not automatically lead to NN impacts , and the gray box in Figure 1 highlights the important moderating influence that NN care and wider JJ NN capability can have in ameliorating potential impacts . Put simply , appropriate NN care and JJ NN input can reduce NN impacts . It is important to recognize that these capabilities are dynamic over NN . Furthermore , they can respond ( ie , adapt ) to JJ situations . CD prominent example of such an NN occurred in response to the 2003 European heatwave during which over 70 CD additional deaths were recorded . CD City dwellers are at particular NN of heat stress given the urban heat island effect . 31 Modeling suggests that in summer 2003 , when an estimated 735 NNS died of causes relating to extreme heat in central Paris , anthropogenic NN NN increased the NN of heat ‐related mortality by approximately 70%,32 illustrating the scale of the issue . In response , JJ European NNS developed early warning systems for heatwaves and national advice and guidelines on NN to reduce potential NN impacts . 33 Adapting JJ NN capabilities will play an important role in responding to NN NN . The arrows in Figure 1 indicate feedback mechanisms between societal infrastructure , JJ NN , and NN measures and NN NN . Measures to reduce NN impacts MD RB reduce GHG NNS . Examples include the NN and JJ cobenefits of low NN diets . 34,35 Much of our understanding of likely impacts from NN NN in the coming decades comes from NN models . Atmosphere ‐Ocean General Circulation Models ( AOGCMs ) 36 use the laws of physics to compute atmospheric , oceanic , and other JJ variables , and represent JJ processes and interactions in the NN NN , at a series of evenly spaced “ cells ” or unit areas IN the globe . Although important tools in our understanding , they are complex and require considerable computational resource to run . For this reason , the cells VBN by NN ‐of ‐the‐art JJ NN models typically span a JJ area in order to reduce the number of calculations required : in turn , the outputs generated are coarse . While these outputs are useful for identifying JJ and regional trends , we VBP to adapt them for local use ( eg , to assess the likely impacts of NN NN in a particular coastal city or tropical community ) . This is accomplished VBG “ downscaling ” methods , 37,38 which involve VBG either statistical approaches or a higher resolution model over a limited area to add greater detail . 39,40 Unlike short‐term NN forecasts , which are dependent on the initial NN of the atmosphere , longer ‐term projections from NN models are largely dependent on trajectories of JJ development and on how fluctuating concentrations of GHGs impact the balance of sunlight absorbed by the NNP and NN radiated back into NN . Thus , these longer ‐term projections are subject to substantial uncertainty not related to the NN NN . In the most recent model simulations , these trajectories are characterized by the representative concentration pathways ( RCPs ) , 41 a comprehensive dataset of NNS to the NNP 's NN balance under JJ possible futures . However , RB when models are run with the same RCP , intermodel variability arises due to differences in how models represent processes , leading to JJ projected future NN NNS . For this reason , a multimodel ensemble is often VBN , in which uncertainty is considered to be represented by the spread of model projections . The various choices and inferences made at each stage of the modeling process can therefore yield a substantial envelope of uncertainty in local impacts . Yet , despite these uncertainties , consistent findings with relevance for epilepsy emerge . For instance , models agree exceptionally well on estimates of heat stress metrics , which combine NN and humidity . 42 Furthermore , each generation of models represents an advance in our understanding of NN processes and a refinement of modeled processes . For example , for a number of extreme NN indices , the spread among the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models ( CMIP5 ; CMIP is a collaborative framework for supporting assessments of NN NN and fostering model development , in which international modeling groups perform simulations VBN on preagreed scientific objectives , generating a database of model outputs with common standards ) is less than the spread among the previous generation CMIP3 models , RB though the project now contains more models . 43 The burden of JJ of these NNS will be felt by those least equipped to adapt . Models project increases in NN variability in Amazonia , Southern Africa , the Sahel , India , and South ‐East Asia over the coming decades . 44 In India , models RB indicate an intensification of heatwaves , with areas that do not currently experience heatwaves becoming severely affected this century . 45 Thus , models can VB us understand where we can expect the effects of NN NN to be most marked and what those effects might be , in turn helping us plan for the likely challenges that will VB to be addressed for NN care in general , and epilepsy in particular . As the NN NNS , we can expect there to be particular implications for epilepsy . These impacts might manifest at the level of altered NN of epilepsy per se , altered NN of seizures in established epilepsy , consequences for epilepsy treatments , and outcomes , with effects more likely to affect those not favored in the JJ place by geography and economics . We can expect inequalities in epilepsy NN care to be further exacerbated . NN NN leads to spread of vectors for infections , which is already being reported , and more can be anticipated . NN ‐driven hyperthermia , fevers , food and NN stress , and starvation MD further compound other difficulties as well as being directly relevant themselves . Moreover , while NNS are remarkably adaptable and have VBN niches in almost every terrestrial environment , NN NN will superimpose unprecedented rates and types of NN . A number of vector ‐borne infections can VB epilepsy or seizures in the acute phase . Chikungunya NN infection is associated with seizures as part of a multisystem acute illness in CD % of patients , 46 while there are NN reports of epilepsy as part of the chronic sequelae of neonatal chikungunya encephalitis .47 Epilepsia partialis continua has been reported with dengue encephalitis.48 Vertical Zika NN infection can lead to epilepsy RB in the absence of microcephaly , 49 and the epilepsy is typically drug‐resistant . 50 If NN NN leads to a spread of the vector carrying the infectious agent , then there will be an accompanying NN of spread of infection ‐related epilepsy or acute seizures . Predictions are difficult , because the impact of NN NN on vectors is multifactorial , and MD be further compounded by multiplier effects as well as actions taking to mitigate its effects . It is already the NN that the NN ‐sensitive diseases affect the poorest populations the most , with higher prevalence and greater mortality , for several reasons . 51 Outbreaks of vector ‐borne infections can easily overwhelm healthcare systems , for example , as shown by recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses , and emergence of infections in naïve populations or those that have lost immunity can be RB more dangerous . JJ factors related to NN NN can alter vector ranges , survival , biting behavior , pathogen infection capacity , and thus ultimately the NN of NN in NNS . NNS in rainfall patterns , drought‐rain cycles , and flood magnitude and frequency can all have effects , while JJ strategies to combat NN NN , such as reestablishment of wetlands and green spaces , can , perversely , promote vector spread . Accounting for these effects in model simulations is particularly challenging , but preliminary studies suggest , for example , that NN NN will favor the spread of dengue fever and other arthropod ‐borne infections given the NN sensitivity of JJ factors favoring the spread of infection . 52 NN , especially urban , effects of NN NN might lead to the spread of cysticercosis,53 neurological involvement from which is a major NN of epilepsy globally . A NN focusing on the NN of spread of vector ‐borne NN in the UK resulting from NN NN suggests that a 1 °C rise in NN MD permit Chikungunya NN transmission for 1‐3 months of the NN across most of southeast England by 2071 ‐2100 , with NNS in transmission ranges RB VBN for a range of other arthropods . 52 Malaria is caused by five NNS of Plasmodium transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes . In malaria‐endemic areas , up to 90 % of the population MD have parasites detectable in their NN . Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are associated with seizures and epilepsy , 54 particularly seizures during acute infections , and development of epilepsy has been documented following severe falciparum malaria . In addition , there is NN that asymptomatic malaria parasitemia can precipitate seizures in those with epilepsy . 55 There are JJ models of the effect of NN NN on the transmission of malaria , with the most significant and consistent effects predicted to occur in the highlands in Africa and parts of South NNP and South ‐East Asia .56 In other regions , the effect of NN NN on malaria transmission MD be minimal due to improved NN measures and socioeconomic factors , although the present decline in malaria transmission across the NN depends on continued support for the current NN measures . However , significant uncertainties exist in these models , particularly in the areas that experience malaria epidemics . Furthermore , most of these models examined the effect of NN NN on mosquitoes that carry P falciparum , but it is the Anopheles NNS that transmit P vivax ( particularly Anopheles atroparvus ) that are most likely to increase seizures and epilepsy in Europe . 57 For example , in CD model , a medium ‐high scenario of NN NN predicts that the southern half of Great Britain will be climatically suitable for P vivax malaria transmission by 2030 and by 2080 RB southern Scotland will be climatically suitable for 2 months of the NN . 58 Phenomena other than infections are RB worsening with NN NN . As conflicts arise , we can expect more head injuries as another NN of epilepsy . A NN from a highly polluted city in NNP suggests that transient increases in air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide are associated with increased hospital visits for epilepsy , supporting findings from another NN from Chile that reported an increased NN of hospitalization for epilepsy with increases in air pollutants . 59 Another NN identified a tentative link between higher relative air humidity and an increased NN of admission for an epileptic seizure ( though higher ambient NN was associated with a lower NN ) . 60 These are preliminary studies that suggest the relationships , if correct , are complex with a NN for more NNS . But , there is certainly a prevailing view that the outlook strongly favors strategies to forestall NN NN rather than trying to deal with the consequences on epilepsy and seizures of the complicated JJ NNS that will occur due to NN NN . NN can affect genes and proteins . Most genetic epilepsies are due to dysfunctional channels . As in much of epilepsy genetics , SCN1A is among the best studied in this regard . Some mutations in SCN1A that can VB epilepsy lead to defective folding of the encoded channel : Mutant channel insertion into a cell NN is NN ‐sensitive , for example , with increased insertion and current density at 30 °C compared to 37°C.61 Mutations in SCN1A can VB the rare , severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy Dravet syndrome . While the effect of such dynamic NNS in the context of prolonged periods of higher ambient NN in thermoregulating NNS is difficult to predict , empirical and modeling NNS show direct effects of higher NNS on sodium channel biophysical properties and neuronal dynamics . 62 Elevated ambient NNS due to hot baths increase seizure frequency in Dravet syndrome . 63 Anecdotally , the UK Dravet syndrome patient support group reported that during the sustained atypical high ambient NNS of the summer of 2018 , affected NNS experienced more seizures and greater lethargy , in keeping with survey NNS from the Netherlands . 64 We previously reported the death of a young patient with Dravet syndrome who had been seizure ‐free , but had been walking outside on the hottest day in Melbourne ( Australia ) for NNS , with a peak of 46.5°C.65 There are other NN ‐sensitive epilepsies , though generally less well studied . An epilepsy ‐related mutation in SCN8A was associated with NN ‐sensitive NN expression and function . 66 Other genetic epilepsies with fever ‐induced seizures include those due to certain mutations in the genes GABRG2 , CHD2 , STX1B : NN elevation can affect brain thermal regulation and epileptiform discharges and induce seizures in models carrying certain mutations in GABRG2 67 or STX1B .68 Moreover , seizures in JJ epilepsies , of all types , are more frequent with psychological stress . NN NN is projected to increase population stress levels as it will affect mean NN , such as rainfall amounts and NN , but RB NN variability and extremes , probably of most consequence for JJ NN . There has been little research into the effects of NN NN on treatments for epilepsy . Lorazepam , VBN in JJ parts of the NN as an emergency treatment for seizures , is especially prone to degradation with higher mean kinetic NN . 69 There are few NNS on other antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , and the summary of product characteristics for several commonly VBN AEDs do not include specific NN recommendations , while , for example , phenobarbital tablets should be stored below 25°C.70 Medication supply chains can be compromised RB today : It is easy to VB how disruption to infrastructure MD threaten AED ( and indeed any drug ) supply , as indeed happened after an exemplar ( but not NN NN ‐related ) disruption in a highly organized , well ‐developed economy in the Great East Japan earthquake of 2011.71 In addition , biodiversity loss is a feature of NN NN : This MD compromise sources , such as plant , microbial , and fungal NNS , from which the next antiepileptic drugs might emerge ( VB Figure 3 ) . Example of a zebrafish behavioral assay showing anticonvulsant activity of a plant extract typically VBN for ethnomedicinal purposes to treat seizures in Cameroon . Zebrafish larvae were pretreated with the ethanolic plant extract ( 25 µg / mL ) for 18 h before acute exposure to pentylenetetrazol ( 20 mmol / L ) . Pentylenetetrazol ‐induced convulsive ‐like behavior was measured 5 min after , VBG an automated video‐tracking device . Graph shows total distance traveled by larvae in millimeters per 5 ‐min interval during a 30 ‐min tracking session . NNS were analyzed VBG specialized software to quantify total larval movements and subjected to CD ‐way with repeated ‐measures ANOVA , followed by Bonferroni 's post hoc test ( n = CD ‐ 12/ group ) . *** P <.001 , *P <.05 ( vs Veh + veh ) , ###P <.001 , # P <.05 ( vs Veh + PTZ ) . EXT , extract ; PTZ , pentylenetetrazol ; Veh , vehicle . Note : Total distance traveled by PTZ ‐treated larvae is lower at later NN intervals as larvae reach the equivalent of status epilepticus at this stage and are less able to move due to loss of posture — therefore accounting for lack of statistical significance between extract ‐treated larvae Moreover , poverty is associated with reduced access to NN care , with the majority of NNS in the NN today with epilepsy having no access to any AEDs . Most NN NN projections anticipate that poverty is likely to increase , with disproportionate effects for those already most vulnerable . Thus , we can anticipate that the negative influence of epilepsy on socioeconomic status and all ‐cause NN of premature mortality will grow with NN NN independent of any direct effect on epilepsy biology . 7 WHAT CAN THOSE INVOLVED IN EPILEPSY DO ? Measures to address NN NN MD include attempts to reduce NN NNS , and actions for mitigation and NN . 1 For epilepsy professionals , there MD be steps that be included in daily practice . Raising awareness of NN NN , its impact for NNS with epilepsy and our contributions to NN NN is a start — the very purpose of this article . Concurrently , more research is required to investigate into NN NN and epilepsy , to better define the risks and develop adaptations and mitigations . Reduction of NN NNS ( “ decarbonizing ” ) MD begin with understanding the sources of NN NNS at the individual level and monitoring of individual NN contributions , for both professionals and NNS with epilepsy . Personal and SME NN NNS calculators are available RB ( examples include : https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx; https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/; https://www.carbontrust.com/resources/tools/carbon-footprint-calculator/). Among the key contributors for most NNS as professionals will be travel , consumption of food and goods , IT equipment , hotels , and restaurants , but this is not an exhaustive list and we invite other suggestions . Travel is likely to be a major contributor for JJ professionals and patients . Flying to conferences and meetings is likely to be an important component of contributions to NNS at the personal professional level . Flying in classes other than economy increases NNS significantly , for several reasons ( eg , VB http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/blog-carbon-footprint-world-bank-group-staff-air-travel). Various websites , including some for academic travel in particular , can VB NNS calculate , reduce , or mitigate NNS ( eg , www.flyingless.org and https://thepointsguy.com/guide/a-guide-to-airline-carbonoffset-programs/). This is a difficult area , as clinical and scientific advances and stronger collaborations do emerge from face ‐to ‐face meetings , and teleconferencing still lacks both the personal touch and infallible reliability . But perhaps not every meeting is essential,65 and to achieve the NN emission reductions necessary to stabilize the NN will require us to modify some current practices and find JJ ways to achieve the same outcomes . Targeted distribution of mitigation measures ( eg , NN offsetting ) for conference attendance to those nations most at NN from NN NN MD suit some conference attendees . Higher levels of sustainability at conferences should be considered : hotel usage , maintenance of ambient NNS in conference halls and hotels ( and personal offices at work ) , and food and drink provision at meetings are all areas to be considered . JJ organizations will consider these difficult NNS to make for meetings that often represent sources of income , but as with JJ aspects of NN NN , there is a bigger picture to consider . NN NNS themselves have considered and addressed the issue of conference travel ( https://noflyclimatesci.org/), RB with a model for a “ nearly NN ‐neutral conference . ” 74 More flying does not necessarily equate with greater academic success .75 Car journeys represent another area in which professionals and patients might both contribute , and actions such as telehealth initiatives MD be possible in some settings and jurisdictions , though NN technology infrastructure , privacy , and regulatory issues MD present difficulties . Professionals can form powerful lobby groups and bring these issues to the attention of their organizations . We must not be nihilistic . Actions at governmental , institutional , and personal levels are required and possible . For example , the UK NNP Alliance on NNP NNP ( http://www.ukhealthalliance.org/) advocates “ for responses to NN NN that protect and promote JJ NN . ” JJ tools are available for further ideas and implementation of NN measures ( eg , https://www.ukcip.org.uk/). Adaptations will be necessary and will VB to be shaped by outcomes from research ( ideally shared across diseases ) , such as improved awareness and management of NNS in vector ranges or medicine manufacture and distribution practice . Nondomestic contributions to NN NN exceed those of the residential sector . NNS and institutions IN the NN are beginning to take NN : The behavior of employees , including epilepsy professionals , MD be overlooked in this process , but can be central to the initiation , promotion , and success of programs designed to address NN NN . Asking employees to switch their computers off at the end of the day , for example , does not mean NNS will do that . Professionals can , however , choose to take the lead . NN shows that NNS can be motivated as much by “ cobenefits ” ( such as JJ and scientific advancement ; or fostering a more moral and caring community ) as they are by concern about NN NN , whether they are convinced about the occurrence of NN NN or not .76 Adaptations might include , for example , increased vigilance and preemptive NNS in behavior against local extreme heat events for NNS with epilepsy due to heat ‐sensitive mutation ‐driven genetic epilepsies , informed by local ( downscaled ) modeling of future NN trends , or improved short‐term NN forecasting . As precision medicine initiatives become more popular , PRP MD envisage inclusion of NN NN parameters in individualized epilepsy management schemes . We summarize some suggestions for actions in Table 2 . Actions to consider regarding epilepsy and NN NN Increase NN available on impact on NN NN on epilepsy and vice versa Collect NNS from NNS with epilepsy , own clinical practice Establish contact with local and national patient and carer support organizations ; gather NNS systematically Establish links with local NN NNS , consider local and regional factors ( eg , urban vs rural ) Changing patterns of seizures and comorbidities reported by NNS with epilepsy ; use of JJ NN and JJ NN methods Included NN and humidity parameters in experimental models ; quantification of stress and consequences in clinical trials ; stability of medications Join local , national , international initiatives for individuals and professionals ; calculate own NN NNS at personal and professional levels Develop practice approaches that are more sustainable Consider NNS with cobenefits to raise chances of engagement and success Consider travel options ; use freely available tools ; explore and engage with local NN service sustainability efforts ; lobby institutions , healthcare organizations , journals and conference organizers Consider measures that facilitate sustainable behavior — for example , earlier setting up of conferences to enable planning of more sustainable travel options Provide NN and advice — for example , when heatwaves are expected ; promote telehealth where possible Switch off devices when not needed ; promote sustainable practices — for example , enable colleagues to attend meetings remotely , record talks for dissemination Promote sustainability for the next generation Facilitate remote supervision and mentoring ; reduce dependence of academic progress upon less sustainable practices Clinicians have always considered prevention to be better than cure . Minimizing the progress of NN NN and mitigating NNS now will be cheaper than taking actions later when the situation has already gotten worse , although there is already a NN for some NN due to NN from historical NNS . The challenge is huge , but it is incumbent upon us to do what we can : This is intrinsic to our commitment and duty to patient care and can be seen as part of the aim of achieving JJ equality of NN care in epilepsy . NNS have managed huge challenges before — the reduction in drink driving rates , the reduced production of aerosols , and NNS in behavior after the HIV epidemic . With NN NN , the challenge is bigger , more JJ , and more urgent , but everything counts . Schools , towns , local councils , and nations have declared NNS of “ NN emergency ” ( eg , https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48126677), with a prominent role played by schoolchildren . Should and can a profession take NN beyond virtue signaling ? And if so , what additional NN do we VB to do that ? Or in fact can we not afford to wait ? We acknowledge the links between epilepsy and NN NN we discuss are speculative , and more research is required . And , of course , anything we can do in our personal lives anyway can contribute to VB counter CD of the biggest challenges facing humanity and all NN on this NN . We should perhaps finish with the words of the next generation , specifically Greta Thunberg ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg),_ADD aged 16 , speaking to members of the European Parliament and European Union officials in Strasbourg on April 16 , 2019 , after the disastrous fire at Notre Dame cathedral : “ It is still not too late to act . It will take a far ‐reaching vision , it will take courage , it will take fierce , fierce determination to act now , to lay the foundations where we MD not VB all the details about how to shape the ceiling . In other words , it will take cathedral thinking . I ask you to please wake up and make NNS required possible . ”"

The warning comes almost a NN after the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) concluded in a landmark report that we only have until 2030 to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and prevent the NN from reaching the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels . The second IPCC report highlights the vicious cycle of NN NN and land degradation . "" We NNS affect more than 70 % of NN - free land , a quarter of this land is degraded . The NN we produce food and what we eat contributes to the loss of natural ecosystems and declining biodiversity , "" VBD Valérie Masson - Delmotte , co-chair of the IPCC . Deforestation and agriculture RB fuel JJ NN , by weakening land 's capacity to draw down NN dioxide from the atmosphere and emitting vast amounts of NN gases . "" When land is degraded , it reduces the soils ability to take up NN and this exacerbates NN NN . In turn , NN NN exacerbates land degradation in JJ JJ ways . Today 500 CD NNS live in areas that experience desertification , "" Masson - Delmotte VBD . But the report does offer hope , there are major opportunities to reverse the damage , the IPCC notes . Here are five key takeaways from the IPCC report : Land the size of South NNP has been degraded JJ use takes up over 70 % of the NN 's NN - free land NN , according to the IPCC report . They degrade the NN 's natural resources , with chemical fertilizers , deforestation and intensive farming . In the process , NNS have damaged CD CD hectares of land , the size of South NNP . As a result , this land is less fertile and captures smaller quantities of NN NNS from the atmosphere , according to Stephen Cornelius , the NNP Wildlife Fund 's ( WWF ) chief advisor on NN NN . "" The NN we use land is driving the NN NN , "" he VBD CNN . "" Ecosystem conversion releases NN gas NNS . Land use , including agriculture and deforestation , produces almost a quarter of the NN 's NN gas NNS . We VBP to stop wasting food and eat less meat The IPCC report stresses that food waste and meat consumption will VB to be reduced if we VBP to slash JJ NNS . Both are JJ contributors to JJ NN -- with food waste producing between 8 - CD % and livestock 14.5 % of JJ NNS , according to WWF . According to the report , 25 - 30 % of all food produced is never eaten , while 821 CD worldwide are undernourished . If food waste was a country , it MD be the third largest emitter after the US and NNP , according to the Waste and Resources NNP Programme ( WRAP ) , a non-profit working to reduce JJ waste . "" The fact that more than CD CD tonnes of food never gets consumed while CD in nine NNS VBP to bed hungry is a travesty , "" VBD Claire Kneller , head of food at WRAP . If the NNP Nations goal of halving food waste by 2030 is to be met , NNS should start measuring waste and adopt their own reduction goal , according to Kneller . "" We will not tackle the impact of NN NN if we do not fix our JJ food NN , "" she VBD . We VBP to restore natural NN sinks Forests and wetlands are important NN sinks , but have been greatly diminished by JJ activities , the IPCC warns , and their ability to capture NN MD continue to decrease depending on JJ actions . Between 2007 - CD , land removed 29 % of total CO2 NNS from the atmosphere . Peatlands -- a type of wetlands -- can hold NN for centuries , but more intense droughts , floods and wildfires MD trigger the release of NN from the soil . Sustainable soil management and agroforestry are key solutions that "" deliver NN sequestration in soil or vegetation , "" the report notes . Land restoration "" represents a fantastic opportunity to draw down NN from the atmosphere , "" Cornelius VBD . "" The food NN is both a leading NN and a casualty of NN NN , "" according to Joao Campari , who leads WWF 's JJ food practice . NN NN increases the frequency and intensity of extreme NN events , such as droughts and floods , which destroy crops and critical farming infrastructure . It 's not just extreme NN that is threatening farming -- NN NN is RB changing what types of crops can grow in certain locations by making it too hot or too dry . Campari VBD CNN the food NN must "" urgently "" be reformed to avoid catastrophic JJ NN . Food production uses 34 % of land worldwide and contributes up to 75 % of deforestation , he VBD . To stave off the worst effects of NN NN , NNS VBP to stop converting land and destroying the soil with fertilizers and by cutting down trees , VBD Campari , adding that we already have enough farmland to feed the JJ population . Bioenergy is not the answer In its report last NN , the IPCC warned that keeping JJ NNS at 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels MD require removing NN dioxide from the atmosphere , VBG techniques such as Bioenergy with NN Capture and Storage ( BECCS ) . But in its latest report , the IPCC VBD that quickly rolling out this technology on a JJ scale "" MD greatly increase demand for land conversion . "" Ramping up bioenergy production through the use of fertilizers and irrigation MD erode soil , increase NN scarcity and threaten food security , the report notes . Claudia Ringler , deputy director at the International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) , VBD CNN that biofuels are not a scalable solution . The NN MD have to convert 7.2 CD square kilometers , 45 % of the NNP 's cropland , into bioenergy crops to keep JJ NNS at 1.5 °C , according to the most NN - intensive scenario outlined in the 2018 IPCC report . "" It 's not possible , not at the rate they are proposing , "" Ringler VBD , explaining that the conversion of this much land MD lead to a huge spike in JJ food prices and drive insecurity ."

But on Wednesday attention was focused across the Atlantic , where in Monaco the UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP presented a special report on the “ unprecedented ” impact NN NN will have on the NN ’s oceans . It ’s not good . The report — compiled by over 100 authors from 36 NNS citing close to 7,000 accredited sources — paints a grim picture of the effect NN oceans and the cryosphere will have on humanity , especially if nothing is done to curb NNS . The ocean has played a critical role in warding off the effects of NN NN by absorbing close to 25 percent of CO2 NNS . The report warns that as the NN continues to rise and the ocean traps more heat , it will become more acidic , less oxygenated , less productive , less hospitable to NN , and more likely to give rise to tropical storms and hurricanes , which will occur with greater frequency and intensity . The report notes that with any additional degree of NN , intense NN events that VBD to occur once per century will in certain regions once per NN by the middle of the 21st century . Connected to the fate of the NN ’s oceans is the fate of the NN ’s frozen areas , or the cryosphere , on which close to 1.5 CD NNS ’s lives directs depend . As parts of the cryosphere melt ( glaciers , for instance ) , the JJ NN level will continue to rise , dramatically altering NN for those living in coast regions , if not making those regions uninhabitable . The NN level is rising twice as fast as it did during the 20th century , and that the rate is increasing , the report notes , explaining that the Antarctic NN sheet will contribute more to NN level rise by 2100 than was previously expected . In the next 80 NNS , the NN level MD increased by up to 60 centimeters if NN gas NNS are dramatically reduced , and 110 centimeters if they are not . It is n’t just glaciers and rising NN levels , either . As permafrost , snow , and NN melt , the frequency of landslides , avalanches , rockfalls , floods , and wildfires will increase . NN availability MD RB be thrown into flux as glaciers retreat , impacting agriculture . “ The NN ’s ocean and cryosphere have been ‘ taking the heat ’ from NN NN for decades , and consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe , ” IPCC Vice Chair Ko Barett VBD in a statement . “ The rapid NNS to the ocean and the frozen parts of our NN are forcing NNS from coastal cities to remote Arctic communities to fundamentally alter their ways of NN . ” In August , the IPCC released a similarly dire report about the impact the NN NN will have on the JJ food supply . This extends well beyond traditional agriculture . The report released Wednesday explains that the “ JJ catch potential ” for fish MD decrease as the NN ocean becomes less hospitable to marine NN , and that communities that rely on seafood MD be in trouble . The only answer is to cut CO2 NNS and work toward more sustainable solutions . “ Cutting NN gas NNS will limit impacts on ocean ecosystems that provide us with food , support our NN and shape our cultures , ” IPCC Co-Chair Hans - Otto Pörtner , Co-Chair VBD in a statement . “ Reducing other pressures such as pollution will further VB marine NN deal with NNS in their environment , while enabling a more resilient ocean . ” Despite the realities detailed in the report , it was structured IN the idea that JJ of these consequences can be mitigated with “ timely , ambitious and coordinated NN ” to reduce NNS and pursue sustainable development . Unfortunately for humanity , NNP and the NNP NNPS , the NN ’s CD largest emitters of NN gases , have largely ignored he NN NN . Neither cared to contribute possible solutions at the UN ’s NNP Summit this week ."

The discovery made JJ NN and rattled the NN . Aerosol NNS dropped dramatically , and , despite pushback from the chemical NNS that made CFCs , Congress in 1977 added protecting the ozone layer to the NNP Protection Agency ’s duties under the Clean Air Act . Not RB afterward , the agency determined that the compounds , then widely VBN in refrigerators , air - conditioners and some industrial processes , posed an RB graver threat to the atmosphere than RB thought . Soon after , pressure began to build for a phaseout of CFCs in the NNP NNPS as well as for an international treaty to find alternatives . The NN for JJ NN became ever more urgent in 1985 when a British team discovered a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica , followed by confirmation by NNP NNS of a connection between the hole and CFCs . With the rest of the NN and RB industry on board , the result was the 1987 Montreal Protocol , a landmark agreement banning chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone - depleting chemicals . End of story ? Not quite . As it happened , the ozone - friendly replacements for the CFCs , VBN as hydrofluorocarbons , turned out to be distinctly unfriendly to the NN . So in CD , the Montreal signatories reconvened in Kigali , Rwanda , and agreed to amend the original protocol to phase out HFCs and find substitutes more friendly to the atmosphere . The bottom line is that the NN , confronted with CD dire threats to the NN ’s fragile atmosphere , VBD CD planetary responses with positive outcomes . The ozone layer is healing . That ’s worth remembering as we struggle , often despairingly , to find common ground in the battle against NN NN . Compared with the manifold complexities of JJ NN , dealing with ozone depletion was , in fact , relatively simple . But the key point is that it happened , and it ’s worth asking why the NN has not responded with similar resolve in dealing with the main JJ NN gases IN NN dioxide , about which we have VBN a lot for a JJ NN ."

In an interview with ABC NNP in Australia , Professor Wæver cautions that what he sees as “ NN inaction ” might draw the U.N. into considering other means to ensure its goals are met , RB if that leads to JJ armed conflict . Professor Wæver VBZ more resistance to NN MD potentially threaten democracy although the U.N. MD counter that the end justified the means in much the same NN NNS IN Greece had their debt NN solutions forced on them by European Union bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg . “ The NNP Nations Security Council MD , in principle , tomorrow decide that NN NN is a threat to international peace and security , ” he VBZ . “ And then it ’s within their competencies to decide ‘ and you are doing this , you are doing this , you are doing this , this is how we deal with it ’. ” He believes classifying NN NN as a security issue MD leave the door open to more extreme policy responses . “ That ’s what happens when something becomes a security issue , it gets the urgency , the intensity , the priority , which is helpful sometimes , but it RB lets the dark forces loose in the sense that it can justify problematic means , ” he VBZ .

It took nearly a century of research and NNS to convince the vast majority of the scientific community that JJ activity MD alter the NN of our entire NN . In the 1800s , experiments suggesting that JJ - produced NN dioxide ( CO2 ) and other gases MD collect in the atmosphere and insulate NNP were met with more curiosity than concern . By the late 1950s , CO2 readings MD offer some of the JJ NNS to corroborate the JJ NN NN . Eventually an abundance of NNS , along with NN modeling MD show not only that JJ NN was real , but that it RB presented a host of dire consequences . Dating back to the ancient Greeks , JJ NNS had proposed that NNS MD VB NNS and influence rainfall by chopping down trees , plowing fields or irrigating a desert . CD NN of NN effects , widely believed until the Dust Bowl of the 1930s , held that “ rain follows the plow , ” the now - discredited idea that tilling soil and other agricultural practices MD result in increased rainfall . Accurate or not , those perceived NN effects were merely local . The idea that NNS MD somehow alter NN on a JJ scale MD seem far - fetched for centuries . In the 1820s , French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier proposed that NN reaching the NN as sunlight must be balanced by NN returning to NN since heated surfaces emit radiation . But some of that NN , he reasoned , must be held within the atmosphere and not return to NN , keeping NNP warm . He proposed that NNP ’s thin covering of air — its atmosphere — acts the NN a glass NN MD . NN enters through the glass walls , but is then trapped inside , much IN a warm NN . Experts have since pointed out that the NN analogy was an oversimplification , since outgoing infrared radiation is n’t exactly trapped by NNP ’s atmosphere but absorbed . The more NN gases there are , the more NN is kept within NNP ’s atmosphere . But the so - called NN effect analogy stuck and some 40 NNS later , Irish scientist John Tyndall MD start to explore exactly what kinds of gases were most likely to play a role in absorbing sunlight . Tyndall ’s laboratory tests in the 1860s showed that coal gas ( containing CO2 , methane and volatile hydrocarbons ) was especially effective at absorbing NN . He eventually demonstrated that CO2 alone acted IN sponge in the NN it MD absorb multiple wavelengths of sunlight . By 1895 , Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius became curious about how decreasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere might cool NNP . In order to explain past NN ages , he wondered if a decrease in volcanic activity might lower JJ CO2 levels . His calculations showed that if CO2 levels were halved , JJ NNS MD decrease by about 5 degrees Celsius ( 9 degrees Fahrenheit ) . Next , Arrhenius wondered if the reverse were JJ . Arrhenius returned to his calculations , this NN investigating what MD happen if CO2 levels were doubled . The possibility seemed remote at the NN , but his results suggested that JJ NNS MD increase by the same amount — 5 degrees C or 9 degrees F . Decades later , modern NN modeling have confirmed that Arrhenius ’ numbers were n’t far off the mark . Back in the 1890s , however , the concept of VBG the NN was remote and RB welcomed . As Arrehenius wrote , “ By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid [ CO2 ] in the atmosphere , we MD hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates , especially as regards the colder regions of the NN . ” By the 1930s , at least CD scientist MD start to claim that NN NNS might already be having a NN effect . British engineer Guy Stewart Callendar noted that the NNP NNPS and North Atlantic region had warmed significantly on the heels of the Industrial Revolution . Callendar ’s calculations suggested that a doubling of CO2 in NNP ’s atmosphere MD warm NNP by 2 degrees C ( 3.6 degrees F ) . He MD continue to argue into the 1960s that a NN - effect NN of the NN was underway . While Callendar ’s claims were largely met with skepticism , he managed to draw attention to the possibility of JJ NN . That attention played a part in garnering some of the JJ NN - funded projects to more closely monitor NN and CO2 levels . Most famous among those research projects was a monitoring station established in 1958 by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography on top of Hawaii ’s Mauna Loa Observatory . Scripps geochemist Charles Keeling was instrumental in outlining a NN to record CO2 levels and in securing funding for the observatory , which was positioned in the center of the Pacific Ocean . NNS from the observatory revealed what MD become VBN as the “ Keeling Curve . ” The upward , saw tooth - shaped curve showed a steady rise in CO2 levels , along with short , jagged up - and - down levels of the gas produced by repeated wintering and greening of the Northern Hemisphere . The dawn of advanced computer modeling in the 1960s began to predict possible outcomes of the rise in CO2 levels made evident by the Keeling Curve . Computer models consistently showed that a doubling of CO2 MD produce a NN of 2 degrees C or 3.6 degrees F within the next century . Still , the models were preliminary and a century seemed a very JJ NN away . READ MORE : When NNP NNP Was Revealed by the Keeling Curve In the early 1970s , a JJ kind of NN worry took hold : JJ cooling . As more NNS became concerned about pollutants NNS were emitting into the atmosphere , some NNS theorized the pollution MD block sunlight and cool NNP . In fact , NNP did cool somewhat between 1940 - 1970 due to a postwar boom in aerosol pollutants which reflected sunlight away from the NN . The idea that sunlight - blocking pollutants MD chill NNP caught on in the NN , as in a 1974 NNP magazine article titled “ Another NNP Age ? ” But as the brief cooling period ended and NNS resumed their upward climb , warnings by a minority of NNS that NNP was cooling were dropped . Part of the reasoning was that while smog MD remain suspended in the air for weeks , CO2 MD persist in the atmosphere for centuries . The early 1980s MD mark a sharp increase in JJ NNS . JJ experts point to 1988 as a critical turning point when watershed events placed JJ NN in the spotlight . The summer of 1988 was the hottest on record ( although JJ since then have been hotter ) . 1988 RB saw widespread drought and wildfires within the NNP NNPS . NNS sounding the alarm about NN NN began to VB NN and the NN paying closer attention . NNP scientist James Hansen delivered testimony and presented models to congress in June of 1988 , saying he was “ 99 percent sure ” that JJ NN was upon us . CD NN later , in 1989 , the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) was established under the NNP Nations to provide a scientific view of NN NN and its JJ and JJ impacts . As JJ NN gained currency as a real phenomenon , researchers dug into possible ramifications of a VBG NN . Among the predictions were warnings of severe heat waves , droughts and more powerful hurricanes fueled by rising NN NN NNS . Other studies predicted that as massive glaciers at the poles melt , NN levels MD rise between 11 and 38 inches ( 28 to 98 centimeters ) by 2100 , enough to swamp JJ of the cities along the east coast of the NNP NNPS . Kyoto Protocol : NNP NNPS In , Then Out NN leaders began discussions to try and stem the outflow of NN gas NNS to prevent the most dire predicted outcomes . The JJ JJ agreement to reduce NN gases , the Kyoto Protocol , was adopted in 1997 . The protocol , which was signed by NNP NNP NNP , called for reducing the emission of six NN gases in 41 NNS plus the European Union to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels during the target period of 2008 to 2012 . In March 2001 , shortly after taking office , NNP George W. Bush announced the NNP NNPS MD not implement the Kyoto Protocol , saying the protocol was “ fatally flawed in fundamental ways ” and citing concerns that the deal MD hurt the U.S. economy . That same NN , the IPCC issued its third report on NN NN , saying that JJ NN , unprecedented since the end of the last NN age , is “ very likely , ” with highly damaging future impacts . Five NNS later , in 2006 , JJ Vice NNP and presidential candidate NNP Gore weighed in on the dangers of JJ NN with the debut of his film An Inconvenient Truth . Gore won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of NN NN . Politicization over NN NN , however , MD continue , with some skeptics arguing that predictions presented by the IPCC and publicized in NN IN Gore ’s film were overblown . Among those expressing skepticism over JJ NN was future U.S. NN Donald NNP . On November 6 , 2012 , NNP tweeted “ The concept of JJ NN was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive . ” Paris NNP Agreement : NNP NNPS In , Then Out The NNP NNPS , under NNP Barack Obama , MD sign onto another milestone treaty on NN NN , the Paris NNP Agreement , in 2015 . In that agreement , 195 NNS pledged to set targets for their own NN gas cuts and to report their progress . The backbone of the Paris NNP Agreement was a declaration to prevent a JJ NN rise of 2 degrees C ( 3.6 degrees F ) . JJ experts considered 2 degrees C of NN to be a critical limit , which , if surpassed will lead to increasing NN of more deadly heat waves , droughts , storms and rising JJ NN levels . The NN of Donald NNP in CD led to the NNP NNPS declaring it MD withdraw from the Paris treaty . NNP NNP , citing the “ onerous restrictions ” imposed by the accord , stated that he MD not “ in good conscience support a deal that punishes the NNP NNPS . ” That same NN , independent analyses by NNP and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) VBD NNP ’s CD NN NNS to be the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880 . And in October 2018 , the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP issued a report that concluded "" rapid , far - reaching "" actions are needed to cap JJ NN at 1.5 Celsius ( 2.7 Fahrenheit ) and avert the most dire , irreversible consequences for the NN . In August 2018 , Swedish teenager and NN activist Greta Thunberg began protesting in front of Swedish Parliament with a sign : “ School Strike for NNP . ” Her protest to raise awareness for JJ NN caught the NN by storm and by November 2018 , over 17,000 students in 24 NNS were participating in NN strikes . By March 2019 , Thunberg was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize . She participated in the NNP Nations NNP Summit in NNP NNP City in August of 2019 , famously taking a boat across the Atlantic instead of flying to reduce her NN footprint . The UN NNP NNP Summit reinforced d that “ 1.5 ℃ is the socially , economically , politically and scientifically safe limit to JJ NN by the end of this century , ” and set a deadline for achieving net zero NNS to 2050 .

The NN NN requires decisive NN from us , here and now . ” Despite the pontiff ’s frequent denunciation of a “ politics of fear , ” he seemed determined to paint as frightening a picture as possible of an impending NN apocalypse in order to incite NNS to NN . This conference “ takes place at a critical moment , ” Francis VBD . “ Today ’s ecological NN , especially NN NN , threatens the very future of the JJ family , and this is not an exaggeration . For too RB we have collectively ignored the fruits of scientific analysis , and catastrophic predictions can no longer be viewed with contempt and irony . ” The pope ’s words Friday went beyond sounding a general alarm and scorning NN - NN skeptics . They RB urged specific JJ NN , most notably regarding penalties for NN usage such as a NN tax . “ A NN pricing policy is essential if humanity wants to use the resources of creation wisely , ” he VBD . “ The failure to manage NN NNS has produced a huge debt that will now have to be repaid with interest from those who come after us . ” The cost of NN usage must be paid here and now by those who use it , and not deferred for future generations to cover , he proposed ."

Why , sometimes I ’ve believed as JJ as six impossible things before breakfast . ” – Lewis Carroll , Through the Looking Glass [ 1 ] The NN 2019 saw the unfolding of a number of dramatic events . At the beginning of the NN , the Venezuelan opposition orchestrated a coup , with dozens of NNS including a number of South JJ NNS recognizing opposition figure Juan Guaidó as NN . This attempt appears to have failed miserably as the NN and the bulk of the Venezuelan population appear to oppose an undemocratic regime NN . In March , the NNP Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) MD release a report detailing the deaths of Palestinians at the hands of Israeli Defense Forces in the wake of the great March of Return protests at the Gaza - Israel perimeter fence MD approach 200 , with 29,000 injured . In April , Wikileaks founder Julian Assange was forcefully removed from the Ecuadorean Embassy in the NNP Kingdom where he had sought sanctuary from a wrongful and unjust prosecution at the hands of the U.S . In June , U.S. - Iran tensions MD escalate with attacks on oil tankers in Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz culminating in the drone killing in early January of high ranking Iranian JJ figure Qasem Soleimani . Popular uprisings IN the globe were unquestionably a feature of the NN . The Gilets Jaunes ( Yellow Vests ) movement endured throughout the entirety of the NN with weekly demonstrations against the Macron NN ’s neoliberal reforms . Likewise , the uprisings in Hong Kong grabbed much of the NN spotlight , And later in the NN , the NN MD VB popular eruptions in Ecuador , Chile , and other Latin JJ centres , in Haiti , in Sudan and in Lebanon . On the NN NN front , while Greta Thunberg and the youth NN activists took centre stage in unprecedented numbers , infernos light up the Amazon , California and Australia , NNS highlight the threat to JJ food supply from NN NN , the NN ’s oceans are being depleted of oxygen , the melting of glacial and polar NN accelerates , and the UN ’s NNP Meteorological Organization reports that the concentration of NN - heating NN gases has hit another all - NN high with “ no sign of a slowdown , let alone a decline . ” And of course , the impeachment drama in NNP continues to transfix JJ Americans while poverty has increased in 30 percent of U.S counties , and while a bi-partisan consensus on Capitol Hill approved last August JJ spending exceeding what was spent at the height of the Cold NNP , RB adjusting for inflation . For independent NN outlets IN the NNP Research NNP Hour , NN stories are curated according to how they impact the broader population , not according to their service to the corporate and NN interests that underwrite most press outlets . Through that lens , the show takes an overdue opportunity to evaluate some of the more important stories and developments of the past NN . Our JJ guest , Andy Lee Roth of Project Censored , discusses some of the Top 25 most censored stories of 2018 - 2019 , and other themes from the publication Censored 2020 . These include NN tank partnerships which turn NNP into a tool of U.S. Foreign Policy ( 2 ) , high rates of unemployment among formerly incarcerated Americans ( 17 ) , and a more equitable model for providing meals for schoolchildren in the U.S. ( 23 ) . In the final half hour , we present a wide - ranging conversation on the NN stories and trends of 2019 featuring independent NN icons Abby and Robbie Martin ( NNP Roots radio ) along with NNP Research NNP Hour co-hosts Michael NNP and Scott NNP . Themes range from the marginalization of dissident viewpoints and analysis under the guise of controlling ‘ JJ NN ’ to the co-opting of ‘ Deep NNP ’ analysis and ‘ NN culture ’ into a kind of partisan cudgel , to the growth of the U.S. empire under NNP , to the corporate and ecological elements missing from coverage of the fires raging IN the NN . Andy Lee Roth , is the Associate Director of Project Censored , a NN research program which fosters student development of NN literacy and critical thinking skills as applied to NN NN censorship in the NNP NNPS . Abby Martin is an investigative journalist and co-producer of Telesur ’s the Empire Files . She RB wrote and directed the 2019 documentary film Gaza Fights for Freedom . She co-hosts the NNP Roots Radio podcast along with her brother Robbie Martin . Robbie Martin is a writer , musician and film maker . He produced the three part documentary film series A Very Heavy Agenda , about the rise and persistent role of the neocons within the NNP establishment ."

They live and breed in some of the NN ’s harshest conditions , nesting in the windblown , rocky coves of the Antarctic Peninsula , a strip of land comprising the northernmost part of the frigid continent . In NN they are precision hunters , darting after krill , the tiny shrimp - IN crustaceans that are their sole food source , utilizing barbed tongues engineered for catching the slipperiest of prey . On land , these 2 - 2.5 - NN - tall flightless birds are prodigious mountaineers , able to scale rocky escarpments in spite of their ungainly waddle . Their perfect NN to local conditions makes them the ideal barometer for the future of the region . If anything VBZ in the marine environment , the NN of chinstrap penguins will be CD of the most reliable indicators . They are the canaries of the Southern Ocean . And these endearing , black and white emissaries from Antarctic waters are starting to disappear . NNS conducting a chinstrap census along the Antarctic Peninsula have discovered drastic declines in JJ colonies , with some seeing population reductions of up to 77 % since they were last surveyed , about 50 NNS ago . The independent researchers , who hitched a ride on a Greenpeace expedition to the region , VBD that every single CD of the 32 colonies surveyed on Elephant Island , a major chinstrap outpost , had declined . Overall , the island ’s total chinstrap population had dropped by more than half , from 122,550 breeding pairs in 1971 to 52,786 in January 2020 . “ Such significant declines suggest that the Southern Ocean ’s ecosystem is fundamentally changed from 50 NNS ago , and that the impacts of this are rippling up the food web to NNS IN chinstrap penguins , ” VBZ Heather J. Lynch , associate professor of ecology & evolution at Stony Brook NNP in upstate NNP NNP , who designed the NN . “ There is something broken in the Southern Ocean , ” adds ornithologist Noah Strycker , a member of the penguin census team , and the author of the 2015 book . “ Our best guess on why that MD be is NN NN , which we VBP is hitting the Antarctic Peninsula region harder than …practically anywhere else in the NN except the Arctic . ” NN waters reduce the NN NN and the phytoplankton that krill depend upon for feeding and survival . Ocean acidification , a side effect of increasing JJ NN NNS , RB impacts their ability to reproduce . For the past five weeks Stony Brook NNS have joined forces with robotics and drone specialists from Boston ’s Northeastern NNP to survey relatively unstudied chinstrap penguin colonies along the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula . Chinstraps prefer rocky , windblown sites for nesting , because they provide the best conditions for keeping eggs safe and dry . Those conditions make research difficult : the NNS endured freezing NNS , wind , rain and snow to reach the coastal rookeries by JJ inflatable motorboats , then scrambled among the colonies counting penguins by hand . The robotics team backed up the survey with drone footage . When they return to the lab , members of that team will use the findings to teach computers how to identify nests VBG artificial intelligence for NN in future surveys . The researchers surveyed 56 colonies in 37 days . So far , they ’ve only released numbers from the Elephant Island sites , which were the JJ to be surveyed . The final report will be published in a few weeks . But those initial findings appear to be consistent across most colonies . “ From whatever limited NNS we have from the 1980s , chinstrap populations appear to be down by over half , ” VBZ biologist Steve Forrest , the team lead on the expedition . On Jan. 31 , 2020 , 26 days into the expedition , Forrest motored IN the NNP ’s Head promontory on Snow Island to scout for potential survey sites . Some 30 NNS ago , researchers documented a colony there , but Forrest had heard rumors from passing boats that it had disappeared . The NN was too rough for a census that day , but it did n’t matter . Peering through a pair of binoculars , Forrest saw no NN that there were any penguins left on the island at all . “ I was hoping that we might find the colony after all , ” he VBZ . “ But not finding CD is more along the lines of what we expected . ” Some of the older surveys in the more difficult - to - reach areas are unreliable — conducted at a distance , by boat — so an exact assessment of how much has changed in the last three decades is impossible . Still , Forrest VBZ , he is confident that chinstrap populations are declining , particularly in the South Shetland Islands ( including Elephant Island ) off the coast of the Peninsula . “ I saw a lot of abandoned nesting places , so I am inclined to VB that it is a real decline , but the precise extent is uncertain . ” While the numbers of chinstraps MD be on the wane , the researchers saw a marked increase in gentoo penguin populations . Gentoos , which have red - orange beaks and lack the distinctive black band IN the throat that gives chinstraps their names , are much more flexible about what they eat and the conditions under which they breed . This means that they can more easily adapt to NNS in their environment . Forrest calls them “ NN NN winners ” for their ability to thrive in conditions that threaten chinstraps — at least in the short term . Strycker calls the process by which the upstarts take over chinstrap areas “ gentoofication . ” Strycker , a committed birder who chronicled his attempt to spot more than half the NN ’s bird NNS in a single NN in a 2017 book called Birding Without Borders : An Obsession , a Quest , and the Biggest NNP in the NNP admits that ultimately , it ’s not RB about the penguins . It ’s about krill . Krill are the foundation of the marine food NN — the fish that eat them are the fodder for the fish on which almost every ocean predator relies . The fish that we NNS eat RB primarily rely on krill as a food source . If krill populations are unhealthy , it means trouble down the line for everyone else . But krill , in their krillions , are hard to VB . That ’s where the chinstraps come in . IN certain whale NNS , chinstraps are krill specialists , but they are relatively easier to track compared to whales , with their erratic migration patterns . Chinstrap penguins reliably return to the same rookeries NN after NN to breed , so by assessing colony NN over NN , NNS can VB a better idea of how the krill they depend on are doing . Which is “ why we should care about a bunch of penguins VBG missing from a remote island that no NN ’s ever heard of , ” VBZ Strycker . “ Penguins give us an idea about what is VBG on in the ocean IN us . The ocean processes that are changing in the Antarctic are similar to the processes that are changing everywhere else in the NN . ” NNS MD not have evolved to catch krill the NN chinstraps do , but our fate is tied to the tiny crustaceans all the same ."

Glaciers and NN sheets from the Himalayas to Antarctica are rapidly melting And the fisheries that feed millions of NNS are shrinking . These are just some of the impacts that NNS of NN gases have already triggered across the NN 's oceans and frozen regions , according to a JJ landmark report from the NNP Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) . "" This report is unique because for the JJ NN ever , the IPCC has produced an in - depth report examining the furthest corners of the NNP -- from the highest mountains in remote polar regions to the deepest oceans , "" VBD Ko Barrett , vice chair of the IPCC . "" We 've VBN that RB and especially in these places , JJ - caused NN NN is evident . "" It is just the latest scientific NN showing that JJ - induced NN is rapidly taking the NN down an uncharted path . The NNS VBP there MD be some impacts to the JJ NN -- IN some amount of NN level rise -- that can no longer be stopped . But RB though there is uncertainty in the report about what exactly the future holds , the authors are unambiguous on this : Despite the damage that has been done , humanity still has a choice . Taking swift NN to end the JJ economy 's dependence on fossil fuels can ward off some of the worst projected impacts , they VBP . Or , we continue down the path we are on , into a NN far less hospitable than the NN we live in . This JJ report paints a full and alarming picture of the rapid thawing happening in frozen regions all across the globe -- and how the NNS will dramatically alter JJ civilization in the coming decades . The findings show that the NN 's NN is accelerating melting in glaciers and NN sheets from Greenland to Antarctica , and that NN levels will likely rise more than previously projected by the end of this century . Because of the growing contributions from Antarctic melting , the authors VBP NN level rise is now likely to exceed three NNS by 2100 if NN NNS continue to increase . Perhaps most concerning is what MD be happening to the Antarctic NN sheet , which has the potential to raise NN levels much higher . The NNS warn that more NN is needed , but VBP NNS observed in parts of Antarctica MD be the JJ signs the NN sheet has reached a point of no return . "" If this is JJ , then there is a chance of a multi - meter NN level rise within the next CD to three centuries , "" VBD Regine Hock , a professor at the NNP of Alaska Fairbanks and a coordinating lead author on chapter CD of this IPCC report . "" That is very substantial . "" RB if collapse of the Antarctic NN sheet is not imminent , the report VBZ that JJ of the 680 CD NNS IN the NN living in low - lying coastal areas will experience annual flooding events by 2050 that VBD to occur only once a century . But over the last 40 NNS , the report finds that Arctic NN NN is very likely shrinking during all months of the NN , which is driving further NN . The decrease observed in September NN NN is particularly significant and likely unprecedented for at least 1000 NNS . In nearly all regions , the NNS RB VBD that snow cover is diminishing and glaciers are in retreat . Runoff from these sources provides drinking NN to millions and is VBN to grow much of the food we eat . And permafrost , soil that stays frozen throughout the NN and contains gigatons of potentially NN - NN NN and methane , has RB undergone record NN . NNS VBP the oceans that cover 71 percent of NNP 's NN have borne the brunt of the NN that NNS have caused . But the report warns they can no longer keep up . It is "" virtually certain "" that the NN 's oceans have warmed nonstop since 1970 and have absorbed 90 percent of the NN 's excess heat , the report VBZ . Marine heatwaves that have killed off vast stretches of NNP 's coral reefs have very likely doubled in frequency and are projected to become more common and intense , the report finds . As a result , shifts have occurred in the geographic ranges of JJ NNS and maximum fish catches have decreased , the NNS VBP . Some regions , IN the Arctic , MD VB fish populations increase . But across the NN 's tropics , fish and other seafood are likely to become harder to find . For the millions of NNS IN the NN that depend on the ocean as a primary food source , the findings are troubling . "" Taken together , these NNS show that the NN 's ocean and cryosphere have been taking the heat for NN NN for decades , "" VBD Barrett . "" The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe . "" The report is clear that there are some future impacts to the oceans and NN that can not be avoided . Instead , JJ vulnerable cities and communities -- especially along the coasts and in the Arctic -- will be forced to adapt to the NNS . Doing so will be difficult , especially for those in the poorest NNS . And the scale and pace of the NNS coming , the report warns , will challenge governments ' abilities to develop and implement solutions . But the NN is equally clear that JJ of the projected impacts can be avoided through ambitious and rapid reductions in NN NNS . For instance , rates of NN level rise are projected to reach 15 millimeters per NN by 2100 under a high NNS scenario . But under a lower NNS scenario -- where NNS draw down JJ NN gases very soon -- NN levels are expected to rise much slower at 4 millimeters per NN . "" It drives home the message that policies that curb NN gas NNS can have a strong effect on future NN level rise , "" VBD Andrea Dutton , an associate professor in the Department of Geoscience at the NNP of Wisconsin Madison . "" What we do today can decide which of those pathways we 're on . "" The choices made now are critical to limit the future impacts , and avoid the escalating costs and risks that come with delayed NN , the report VBZ ."

Indeed , as he saw it , acting on NN NN was a moral obligation of the present , not a distant problem of the future . And that ’s because , RB before NNP Obama assumed office , the NN was already changing in ways that — if left unchecked — MD have a profound impact on all of humankind . The scientific NN accumulated and reviewed over the past several decades showed unequivocally that the NN was NN , primarily due to JJ activities over the past 50 NNS . As a result , summers were becoming longer and hotter . Winters were becoming shorter and warmer . NN on land and in lakes and seas was melting . JJ NN levels were rising . And from storms , hurricanes , and heavy downpours to droughts , fires , and floods , extreme NN was becoming more frequent and intense . Simply put , NN NN was dramatically altering the NN — and altering it in ways detrimental to NN on NNP . This timeline tells the story of how the NNP and his team took NN to mitigate the impacts of NN NN and protect our environment at home . It documents the decisions made , as well as the challenges faced , by the Administration in its efforts to protect the air we breathe , the NN we drink , and the land that supports and sustains us . Above all , the timeline shows that — from reducing NN pollution and expanding the clean NN economy to increasing the resilience of communities to the impacts of NN NN to restoring ecosystems and preserving iconic landscapes — the NNP worked diligently to bring together Federal agencies , and all stakeholders , to tackle the greatest JJ challenges and JJ opportunities of our NN . • November 4 , 2008 – NNP - elect Obama pledged “ to build JJ partnerships to defeat the threat of the 21st century : terrorism and nuclear proliferation , poverty and genocide , NN NN and NN . ” • November 18 , 2008 – NNP - elect Obama pledged that “ My presidency will mark a JJ chapter in NNP ’s leadership on NN NN that will strengthen our security and create millions of JJ jobs in the process . ” • January 26 , 2009 – NNP Obama signed a memorandum directing the Department of Transportation ( DOT ) and the NNP Protection Agency ( EPA ) to begin working to update vehicle fuel economy standards . • April 1 , 2010 – The U.S. EPA and the Department of Transportation ’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) finalized a joint rule to establish a national program consisting of JJ standards for model NN 2012 through CD light - duty vehicles that will reduce NN gas NNS and improve fuel economy . • August 28 , 2012 – EPA and DOT issued NN gas and fuel economy standards covering passenger cars and trucks for model NNS 2017 – 2025 that will nearly double the fuel efficiency of those vehicles compared to JJ vehicles currently on our roads , saving households hundreds of millions of dollars at the pump and making the U.S. less reliant on fossil fuels . • Since 2009 , DOE ’s Building Technologies Office ( BTO ) has issued 58 JJ or updated appliance and equipment standards , which are projected to save consumers over $ 550 CD off their utility bills through 2030 , equivalent to saving the average family nearly $ 200 per NN , and cut NN dioxide NNS by nearly 3 CD metric tons . • February 17 , 2009 – NNP Obama signed into law the NNP Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( ARRA ) , which not only helped bring about a macroeconomic recovery but RB invested $ 90 CD in clean NN and NN efficiency , the largest single investment in clean NN in history . • In a retrospective analysis of the ARRA , published in February 2015 , the White NNP Council of NNP Advisers VBD that these investments transformed NNP ’s clean NN economy by supporting job creation , driving innovation , and scaling up renewable NN .

A damning report compiled by the UN's NNP Meteorological Organisation ( WMO ) highlights 2019 's increasing heat , accelerating NN level rises , and extreme NN . Last NN was the second hottest NN on record , with a JJ average NN of almost 2 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels , the WMO VBD . The five NNS from 2015 - 2019 were the five warmest NNS on record and 2010 - 2019 was the hottest decade since records began in the 19th century . UN Secretary - General Antonio Guterres VBD NN was needed urgently , that there is no NN to lose ' if we are to avert NN catastrophe . ' The report VBD that each decade since the 1980s has been hotter than any preceding decade stretching back to 1850 when records began . The NN had input from national meteorological services , international experts , scientific institutions and UN agencies . The trends VBD so far continue in 2020 , with the report published in the wake of the hottest January on record and some parts of the northern hemisphere , including Europe , experiencing an unusually warm winter . Antarctica has reported JJ NN highs , accompanied by JJ - scale NN melt and a fracturing glacier which will have ' repercussions for NN level rise ' . Petteri Taalas , secretary - general of the NNP Meteorological Organization VBD at a briefing on the agency 's annual NN of the NNP NNP 2019 report that NN dioxide has contributed CD - thirds of JJ NN . He VBD it has a ' lifetime is of several hundreds of NNS - so it 's a problem that does n't VB away if you let these concentrations continue . ' This NN NNS are expected , under the international Paris Agreement on NN NN , to increase their NN to tackle NN gas NNS to prevent the worst impacts of JJ NN . In a foreword to the report , Guterres VBD : ' We are currently RB off track to meeting the targets that the Paris Agreement calls for . ' This report outlines the latest NN and illustrates the urgency for far - reaching NN NN . ' Alongside NN increases , rainfall NNS had a major impact on several NNS and NN levels were rising at an increasing pace , exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater NN of flooding and submersion , he VBD . NN gas levels in the atmosphere continued to rise in 2019 , and NN NNS from JJ fossil fuels grew 0.6 per cent last NN . The report VBD record high NNS from Australia to India , Japan , and Europe RB impacted on NNS 's NN . There were CD major heatwaves in Europe , in June and July , with JJ national NN records set in the UK , where the thermometer hit 38.7C . There were RB record NNS in Germany , the Netherlands , Belgium , Luxembourg and France . ' We have RB broken records in NN dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide , ' three NN gases that VBP JJ NN , ' VBD Taalas . ' Given that NN gas levels continue to increase , the NN will continue . ' He added it was a matter of NN before the NN had a JJ record hot NN - with predictions it will come within five NNS . There are RB implications for NN - with dengue fever spreading to the point where half the NN population is at NN of infection . NN hunger is on the rise again , and an estimated 22 CD NNS worldwide were forced to leave their homes by events such as floods and storms . Guterres , VBD : ' NN gas concentrations are at the highest levels in 3 CD NNS - when the NNP 's NN was as much as three degrees hotter and NN levels some 15 meters higher . ' Ocean heat is at a record level , with NNS rising at the equivalent of five Hiroshima bombs a second . ' Taalas VBD the NN of the oceans has led to unusual tropical storms , including CD in Mozambique in March 2019 that was the strongest in the Southern Hemisphere 'at least for the past hundred NNS . ' He VBD there is RB an estimate ' that NN NN is the most acid in 25 CD NNS ... and that 's VBG to have negative impacts on the NN ecosystems . ' Taalas RB pointed to forest fires causing a lot of NNS , in the Arctic and Australia where ' they were , again , record breaking . ' ' Smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in Australia circumnavigated the globe , causing a spike in NN dioxide NNS , ' he VBD . The contiguous US , excluding Alaska , Hawaii and other islands , experienced the highest 12 - month rainfall on record from July 2018 to June 2019 , and the country lost an estimated $ 20 CD ( £ 15 CD ) from flooding last NN . Drought or low rainfall hit JJ parts of the NN , including Australia , which RB saw its hottest NN and hottest December on record and an exceptionally JJ and severe season of wildfires . Some parts of the Arctic RB burned - an extremely rare occurrence - and NN NN in the region continued to decline . The Greenland NN sheet saw 329 CD tonnes of NN loss in 2019 , well above the average for recent NNS , and glaciers continue to melt . NN levels were at record highs in 2019 , and at least 84 per cent of the oceans experienced at least CD marine heatwave . NN ocean NNS , along with more acidic NN and lower oxygen levels , are having an impact on marine wildlife and habitats such as coral . JJ NNS VBP the use of fossil fuels , which are CD of the main sources of NN gases , VBP to end by the middle of the century if average NNS on NNP are to rise no more than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 . So far 70 NNS have announced they are committed to net - zero NN NNS by 2050 , joined by cities , banks , businesses and others , but this still represents only CD - quarter of JJ NNS . ' The largest emitters must commit or our efforts will be in vain , ' Guterres VBD . In the coming months , the UN will be ' very actively engaging ' Western Europe nations including the US , Canada , NNP , India , NNP and Japan . This is ' in order to have as JJ as possible , ideally all of them , committed to NN neutrality in 2050 , ' the secretary - general VBD . Guterres pointed to ' good NN ' from the European Union , which unveiled plans last week for its JJ - ever NN law that MD legally bind its executive arm to cutting NN gas NNS by mid-century . ' Let 's hope that this example can be followed by all the others , ' he VBD ."

The highly contagious phocine distemper NN — which is not believed to affect NNS — attacks the respiratory and nervous systems of some marine mammals . But there was no indication it had infected animals that MD have taken it to JJ parts of the NN . “ How did a NN that had previously been seen in the Atlantic Ocean end up in the Pacific Ocean ? ” VBD Tracey Goldstein , associate director of the NNP NNP Institute at the NNP of California , Davis , School of Veterinary Medicine . Goldstein and some of her colleagues examined 15 NNS of NNS that included measurements of Arctic NN NN and NNS from animals that had been tagged by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other institutions to VB their migration patterns . Their conclusion : Melting Arctic NN NN brought on by the NNP ’s NN NN created a NN for the NN to move into a JJ region and infect a JJ population of NN NN . “ It was a perfect storm in 2002 , ” she VBD . “ It was the lowest NN NN on record at the NN , and at the same NN , in August and September , there was a RB JJ outbreak . ” The work of Goldstein and her colleagues , published Wednesday in the journal Scientific Reports , RB VBD NN and nasal swab samples from seals , NN lions and otters from southeast Alaska to NNP to assess which populations had been infected with the NN , and which specific strain they had been exposed to . The researchers noticed a link between NN NN losses in the Arctic and spikes in outbreaks of the NN . In particular , the NNS VBD that drastic reductions in NN NN on the Russian side of the North Atlantic coincided with increases in exposure rates in both ocean basins . The melted NN , Goldstein VBD , was likely opening up JJ waterways for infected animals to come into contact with other NNS . The NN adds to growing research that JJ NN is having some unexpected impacts on animal and JJ NN , such as increasing outbreaks of toxic algal blooms that can sicken marine animals and widening the range of ticks that carry potentially devastating diseases . There ’s no NN to suggest that phocine distemper NN can be transmitted to NNS , but the NN belongs to the same family as the NNS . And IN the NNS , it ’s highly virulent . The NN is likely being spread among the animals when they gather to nest and breed , or when they feed in close proximity , according to the NN ’s lead author Elizabeth VanWormer , who conducted the research as a postdoctoral researcher at UC Davis but is now an assistant professor at the NNP of Nebraska , Lincoln . Enabling transmission of the distemper NN is not the only NN that NN NN is impacting animal NN . Along the west coast of the NNP NNPS , NN ocean NNS have intensified outbreaks of harmful algal blooms that can sicken marine mammals , VBD Shawn Johnson , the director of veterinary NN at The Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito , California , who was not involved with the JJ research . “ We ’re seeing more and more of these toxic blooms affecting our animals , ” Johnson VBD . “ This is not unique . It ’s just another important piece of NN showing that NN NN is impacting the marine mammals all up and down the West Coast . ” The NN ’s findings have implications not only for marine mammal populations but RB the delicate balances that exist within ecosystems . “ When we VBP these NNS happening in animals , we ca n’t ignore them , because the impacts on NNS and the NN are not far behind , ” VanWormer VBD . ” This shows how interconnected these things are — the NN of NNS , animals and the NN . ” The research should RB act as a warning sign for the potential impacts that NN NN can have on the ability to fight diseases and prevent their spread , according to Johnson . “ The NN is changing so rapidly , ” he VBD . “ Understanding how diseases and the ecology of diseases are changing in wildlife and marine mammals will give us insight into the future , and how we VBP to be prepared for a JJ paradigm of NN transmissions in animals and in NNS . ”"

Dermatitis is a common condition that has JJ causes and occurs in JJ forms . It usually involves itchy , dry NN or a rash on swollen , reddened NN . Or it MD VB the NN to blister , ooze , crust or flake off . Examples of this condition are atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) , dandruff and contact dermatitis . Dermatitis is n't contagious , but it can make you feel uncomfortable and self - conscious . Moisturizing regularly helps VB the NNS . Treatment MD RB include medicated ointments , creams and shampoos . Each type of dermatitis MD look a little JJ and tends to occur on JJ parts of your body . Signs and NNS of JJ types of dermatitis include : • Atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) . Usually beginning in infancy , this red , itchy rash usually occurs where the NN flexes — inside the elbows , behind the knees and in front of the neck . The rash MD leak fluid when scratched and crust over . NNS with atopic dermatitis MD experience improvement and then seasonal flare - ups . • Contact dermatitis . This red , itchy stinging rash occurs where your NN has come into contact with substances that irritate the NN or VBP an allergic reaction . You MD develop blisters . • Seborrheic dermatitis . This condition causes scaly patches , red NN and stubborn dandruff . It usually affects oily areas of the body , such as the face , upper chest and back . Seborrheic dermatitis can be a JJ - term condition with periods of improvement and then seasonal flare - ups . In infants , this condition is called cradle cap . • Follicular eczema . With this type , the affected NN thickens and develops bumps in hair follicles . This condition is common in African Americans and in NNS with dark - brown NN . When to VB a NN VB your NN if : • You 're so uncomfortable that you are losing sleep or are distracted from your daily routines • You suspect your NN is infected • You 've tried self - care steps but your signs and NNS persist Causes of the most common types of dermatitis include : • Atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) . This type is likely related to dry NN , a gene variation , an JJ NN dysfunction , a NN infection , exposure to food , airborne , or contact allergens , or a combination of these . • Contact dermatitis . This type results from contact with something that irritates your NN or causes an allergic reaction . Irritants or allergens include poison ivy , perfumes , jewelry containing nickel , cleaning NNS , and the preservatives in JJ creams and lotions . • Seborrheic dermatitis . This type is caused by a yeast ( fungus ) that is in the oil secretion on the NN . • Age . Dermatitis can occur at any age , but atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) usually begins in infancy . • Allergies and asthma . NNS who have a personal or family history of eczema , allergies , hay fever or asthma are more likely to develop atopic dermatitis . • Occupation . Jobs that put you in contact with certain metals , solvents or cleaning supplies increase your NN of contact dermatitis . Being a NN care worker is linked to hand eczema . • NN conditions . NN conditions that put you at increased NN of seborrheic dermatitis include congestive heart failure , Parkinson 's NN and HIV / AIDS . Scratching the itchy rash associated with dermatitis can VB open sores , which MD become infected . These NN infections can spread and MD very rarely become NN - threatening . Wear protective clothing if you are doing a task that involves irritants or caustic chemicals . Avoid dry NN by adopting these habits when bathing : • Take shorter baths and showers . Limit your baths and showers to 5 to CD minutes . Use warm , rather than hot , NN . Bath oil RB MD be helpful . • Use a gentle , nonsoap cleanser . Choose unscented nonsoap cleansers . Some soaps can dry your NN . • Dry yourself gently . After bathing , gently pat your NN dry with a soft towel . • Moisturize your NN . While your NN is still damp , seal in moisture with an oil , cream or lotion . Try JJ NNS to find CD that works for you . Ideally , the best NN for you will be safe , effective , affordable and unscented . CD JJ studies showed that applying a protective moisturizer to the NN of infants at high NN of atopic dermatitis reduced the incidence of the condition by up to 50 percent ."

But CD of the main points they make — linking NN of women ’s reproduction to JJ goals — is problematic . Focusing on what women in poor nations with the highest birth rates can do to curb NN NN distracts from holding wealthy NNS and corporations accountable for their disproportionate harm to the NN and imperils the NN to reproductive autonomy . The paper , “ NNP NNPS ’ Warning of a NNP Emergency , ” was published in early November on the 40th anniversary of the JJ NN NN conference . It rightfully warns of “ untold suffering ” without “ major transformations in the ways our JJ society functions . ” Reducing population growth is CD of six steps the authors VBP MD slow NN dioxide NNS . They RB argue that to decrease the birthrate , family planning services and primary and secondary education VBP to be more available and accessible . The group ’s website goes a JJ step further . It VBZ families must be encouraged to have fewer NNS and sounds the overpopulation alarm . A startling graph shows a dramatic NN population spike beginning in the 19th century . The accompanying text refers to NNS giving birth as “ adding more NN emitters to the NN . ” This presents a troubling and unfair picture and promotes the scapegoating of women . Access to family planning and education are essential to gender equity and must be fiercely promoted in their own NN . But arguing that they are an instrument against NN NN implies that the most disenfranchised have an outsize role to play in the fight because of higher birth rates , when in reality they contribute very little to NN gas NNS . High - and upper - middle - income NNS have higher per-capita NNS and account for 86 % of JJ NN NNS , despite having the lowest fertility rates . And RB though some observers argue JJ development will lead to higher per-capita NN NNS from poor NNS in the future , the JJ scientific and policy communities ’ response should be laser - focused on bold systemic NNS , such as restraining the use of fossil fuels , rather than persuading NNS to have fewer NNS . Emphasizing population reduction as a response to JJ NN is RB problematic because it MD provide a perverse incentive for family planning services to lose sight of NNS ’s NN to make their own decisions about contraception and childbearing . The NNS ’ warning rightly VBZ that family planning programs should be voluntary and ethical , but those concepts can start to blur when women ’s choices are put in competition with the future of the NN . Historically , population growth alarmism coupled with eugenic ideas about who is worthy of reproducing has led to a painful JJ legacy of coercion and abuse — including , most prominently , NNS of forced sterilization in India and NNP ’s CD - NN policy . Such blatant examples have been less common in the NNS since the landmark 1994 International Conference on Population and Development marked a shift away from population NN toward protecting reproductive NN and rights . However , those ideas have n’t died . Just four NNS ago , Stanford NNP biologist Paul Ehrlich , who wrote the 1968 book “ The Population Bomb , ” VBD he MD endorse “ various forms of coercion ” to keep NNS from having more NNS . An inherent and unresolvable tension remains between viewing family planning as a tool to mitigate NN NN and valuing an individual ’s NN to choose to have a NN . Framing family planning as a means to an end — especially when the “ end ” is as urgent and important as slowing NN NN — MD lead anxious policymakers and healthcare providers focused on reducing population to push contraceptive methods that are considered more effective , without regard for a woman ’s needs and preferences . It MD RB lead them to be less likely to make sure women are able to have provider - controlled methods — such as intrauterine devices or contraceptive implants — removed on demand . Curbing NN NN and making high - quality , rights - VBN contraception and abortion services accessible to those who VBP them are both urgent issues that deserve attention and resources . However , the misplaced emphasis on poor women ’s reproduction risks sacrificing JJ rights to chip away at NN NN , a massive problem that needs transformational solutions . And it RB distracts from the fact that poor communities are the least likely to have the resources to mitigate the devastating impact of NN NN on their lives and livelihoods , and thus have the most to lose . RB if women in poor NNS stopped having NNS tomorrow , without massive decarbonization of the economy neither the NN nor their lives will be any better off now or in the future . As NN - NN NNS continue to push the NN toward urgent NN , they should avoid family planning as a solution . Instead , they can follow the lead of the NN justice movement and promote a JJ - rights - VBN approach that holds governments and businesses accountable for reducing reliance on fossil fuels — and for mitigating the disproportionate burden borne by the most poor and disenfranchised . A bold vision for tackling the NN emergency requires nothing less .

In the latest of a series of reports , the NNP Accountability Office VBZ that costs of disaster assistance to taxpayers since 2005 have swelled to nearly $ 500 CD — and they keep getting higher . “ The federal budget , however , does not generally account for disaster assistance provided by Congress or the JJ - term impacts of NN NN on existing federal infrastructure and programs , ” GAO VBD in the 16 - page report , which was presented as testimony to Congress by Alfredo Gómez , director of the office ’s natural resources and environment team . Moreover , the NN “ does not have certain NN needed by policymakers to VB understand the budgetary impacts of such exposure , ” GAO VBD . The findings follow a dramatic escalation in federal spending on disaster assistance since 2005 . Much of that NN — upward of $ 450 CD — has been appropriated under supplemental spending packages following disasters rather than through the normal budgetary process . In 2018 , Congress approved $ 91 CD in disaster spending to VB communities recover from hurricanes , floods , wildfire and drought . The outflow of disaster dollars has continued into 2019 ; Congress has passed bills authorizing an additional $ 19.1 CD , according to federal figures . The growing frequency and intensity of disasters is being felt in every region of the country and across a broad cross-section of the economy , from NN and real estate to farming and fisheries . The report includes 21 examples of NN NN ’s JJ impacts , most of which will place additional strain on federal resources . They include infrastructure damage in coastal zones from NN - level rise and storm surges , increased heat - related mortality in the Southeast and Midwest , NNS in NN supply and demand in the West , and decreased agricultural yields in the southern Plains and Southwest . GAO RB identified CD types of potential benefits from NN NN : fewer deaths from cold NN in the Upper Midwest and improved agricultural yields in the northern Great Plains and parts of the Northwest , mainly associated with longer growing seasons . Financial exposure to NN disasters will be felt hardest in three pots of NN spending : disaster response , flood and crop insurance , and operation and management of federally owned property and JJ lands . Investigators noted that the National Flood Insurance Program , for example , owes the U.S. Treasury $ 21 CD associated with massive payouts to flood victims dating back to 2005 . Similarly , the Congressional Budget Office estimated in NNP 2019 that federal crop insurance MD cost the NN an average of about $ 8 CD annually from 2019 through 2029 due to worsening floods , droughts and other NN stressors . Federal properties , IN Tyndall Air Force Base on the Florida Panhandle , are RB facing increased financial exposure from hurricanes and other extreme NN events , GAO VBD . Hurricane Michael virtually destroyed Tyndall in 2018 , and its reconstruction is estimated to cost more than $ 4 CD ( Climatewire , July 3 ) . Rob Moore , a senior policy analyst and expert on NN NN and resilience at the Natural Resources Defense Council , VBD GAO ’s findings are consistent with previous warnings from financial experts that the costs of NN disasters are far exceeding the NN ’s ability to pay . Federal agencies “ are still treating these disasters as random events . We just throw a bunch of NN at them after the fact and assume they wo n’t happen again . The problem is we ’re having these types of disasters every NN now , ” Moore VBD . Spending hundreds of billions of dollars in disaster - specific supplemental relief cannot continue , he added . “ We VBP to both start accounting for the growing NN to respond to disasters within the regular appropriations process , ” Moore VBD . “ More importantly , we VBP to start making investments that reduce our exposure and vulnerability to these types of damages . ” Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&E NNP .

Brazilian NNS measured a NN of 20.75 degrees Celsius ( approximately 69.35 degrees Fahrenheit ) on Seymour Island Feb. 9 , CD of the researchers VBD AFP Thursday . The record was broken three days after the Antarctic continent recorded its highest NN to date at a balmy 18.3 degrees Celsius ( approximately 64.9 degrees Fahrenheit ) . That measure was taken at Argentina ’s Esperanza station on the Antarctic peninsula that extends north towards South NNP . The Brazilian reading was taken on CD of the islands that extends off that peninsula , according to BBC NNP . It breaks the previous record for the entire Antarctic region , defined by the NNP Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) as all the land and NN south of 60 degrees . The previous record for the region of 19.8 degrees Celsius ( approximately 67.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) was recorded in 1982 on Signy Island . Schaefer was careful to point out that the NN reading was not part of a larger NN and so MD not be VBN as NN of a NN trend . However , Antarctica as a whole has warmed by almost three degrees Celsius over the past 50 NNS , according to WMO NNS reported by BBC NNP . During that NN , about 87 percent of the glaciers on its western coast have retreated . The region RB just recorded its warmest January on record . Schaefer works as part of Brazil ’s Terrantar project that studies 23 sites in Antarctica . NNS on the peninsula , the South Shetland Islands and the James Ross archipelago cooled during the JJ decade of the 21st century , and then began to rise quickly , he VBD The Guardian . The peninsula and its surrounding islands have been the areas of Antarctica most impacted by the NN NN so far , which means they might indicate how the rest of the region will react . If all of the NN in Antarctica were to melt , it MD VB 50 to 60 meters ( approximately 164 to 197 NNS ) of NN level rise . This MD take centuries , however . In the nearer term , NNS predict 30 to 110 centimeters ( approximately 12 to 43 inches ) of NN level rise by 2100 , depending on how successfully NN gas NNS are reduced and how the NN reacts ."

Worse yet , it ’s now testing psychological and technical support at 50 for the fourth NN in 13 months , raising odds for a breakdown that brings the deep December 2018 at 42.36 into play . As a consumer , you might VB that cheap crude oil prices are great for the economy and your family ’s bottom line . However , the contract is a highly - cyclical instrument that tracks JJ expansion and contraction with surprising accuracy . RB now , the selloff is waving a red flag , telling us that NN traders are worried that NN economies will enter recessionary waves as a result of NNP ’s isolation and the potential escalation into other parts of the NN . More importantly from a technical standpoint , a decline into the 2018 low will mark the next phase in a massive 17 - NN descending triangle pattern , with support at the 2009 low in the lower 30s . The contract last tested that critical level in early CD , breaking down into the mid-20s before reversing gears and remounting broken support . It ’s failed to post a higher high in the last 4 NNS , maintaining a secular downtrend that ’s now entered its 12th NN . NN activists MD view crude oil ’s decline as a positive development , with more industries moving away from fossil fuels and into NN - neutral NN sources . However , it ’s unlikely that paradigm shift has reached critical mass , given healthy demand as a result of the multiyear JJ expansion . In addition , dwindling crude oil resources IN the NN in coming NNS is likely to generate a premium for the commodity , with remaining NNS forced to pay up due to lower supply . Fortunately , the evolution of crude oil prices has been moving at a snail ’s pace , telling NN players there ’s plenty of NN to take NN if exposed to the industry through NN stocks or the futures markets . However , as we learned in 2008 , contract volatility can escalate rapidly in response to NN shocks IN that NN ’s JJ collapse , so it makes sense to keep a watch on NN NN at all times . The contract soared from the mid-teens into the lower 40s in just 4 months in 1990 , driven higher by the JJ Iraqi invasion . It settled back to NN a few months later , reentering a multiyear trading range that broke to the upside once again in 2004 when NN economies were getting back on the NNS after the burst Internet bubble . The uptrend went parabolic in 2006 , driven by heavy speculation as a result of NNP ’s multi-trillion dollar industrial expansion . A vertical plunge followed 2008 ’s all - NN high at 147.47 , dropping the contract into a test at breakout support in the JJ quarter of 2009 . It made steady progress into 2011 , finally reversing a few points under the .786 Fibonacci selloff retracement level . That marked the highest high in the last 9 NNS , ahead of a broad trading range that broke to the downside in 2014 . That selloff printed the JJ lower monthly high for the contract in more than CD decades .

Avaaz examined 5,537 videos retrieved by the search terms “ NN NN , ” JJ NN ” and “ NN manipulation , ” and then the videos most likely to be suggested next by NNP ’s “ up next ” sidebar . For each of those search terms respectively , 8 % , 16 % and 21 % of the top 100 related videos included by NNP in the “ up - next ” feature contained NN that goes against the scientific consensus on NN NN – such as denying NN NN is taking place , or claiming that JJ activity is not a NN of NN NN . Avaaz claims this promotion process means NNP is helping to spread NN denialism . “ We ’ve VBN that it ’s very likely that at least CD in five NNS who search for a term IN JJ NN or NN NN MD be sent down this type of misinformation rabbit hole , ” VBZ Fadi Quran , a campaigns director at Avaaz , and CD of the report ’s authors . “ NNS are working so hard to educate NNS about the existential threat we face and NNP is allowing bad actors among us the last word on this issue for JJ NNS . ” Smaller scale studies have previously suggested that a majority of NN - related videos on NNP oppose the scientific consensus on NN NN . The “ up next ” feature dictates what NNS watch for 70 % of the NN they spend on NNP . The exact make - up of the NNP algorithm that drives recommendations , designed to keep NNS on the platform for as RB as possible , is a closely guarded secret . Experts VBP the algorithm appears to have learned that radical or outrageous NN is more likely to engage viewers . When it comes to NN NN , Avaaz VBZ , that leads to the promotion of controversial videos with titles such as “ JJ NN is a hoax ” and “ ACTUAL SCIENTIST : NNP NN is a Scam ! ” The algorithm is RB personalized to each user , meaning that after you watch CD NN containing NN misinformation , it is more likely to recommend another for you . In January 2019 , responding to criticism over the platform ’s tendency to drive NNS towards more radical JJ and JJ viewpoints , NNP announced that in the U.S. it MD begin reducing recommendations of “ borderline ” NN that pushed the limits of Community Guidelines on areas IN hate speech , as well as “ NN that MD misinform NNS in harmful ways — such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness , claiming the NN is JJ , or making blatantly JJ claims about historic events IN 9/11 ” . In December , NNP VBD that policy had been successful , driving down the average NN spent by U.S. NNS watching recommended “ borderline ” NN or harmful misinformation by 70 % . But Quran VBZ it remains unclear if that policy is effectively applied to NN denialist NN . “ They VBP all scientifically inaccurate NN that causes harm is included under that policy — which should indicate that NN denial is part of it , ” he VBZ . “ However [ NNP ’s parent NN ] is not transparent and our research so far indicates that NN denial videos are still being actively recommended . Either their downgrading tools are not working as they should , or they have decided to exclude NN denial from the NN . ” A NNP spokesperson tells NN , “ We ca n’t speak to Avaaz ’s methodology or results , and our recommendations systems are not designed to filter or demote videos or channels VBN on specific perspectives . ” They add that NNP ’s systems “ prioritize authoritative voices for millions of NN and NN queries , and NN NN panels on topics prone to misinformation — including NN NN — to provide NNS with context alongside their NN ” and that the systems appear to have done so “ in the majority of NNS in this report ” . Ads for major brands appeared alongside the videos containing NN misinformation seen by Avaaz . The campaign group claims that by promoting NN denial videos to drive more viewing NN , and by placing ads alongside these videos , NNP is profiting from the spread of misinformation . The NNP spokesperson VBZ they have “ strict ad policies that govern where ads are allowed to appear and we give advertisers tools to opt out of NN that does n’t align with their brand . ” Pressure from advertisers , some of whom Avaaz informed about their findings , MD potentially push NNP to take more NN on NN denial NN . An advertising boycott in 2017 , when brands sought to prevent their ads appearing alongside extremist NN , cost Google millions of dollars in revenue , and helped drive NNP to strengthen efforts to limit how often its platform surfaced extremist NN . ( As well as reducing the promotion of borderline NN , in June , the platform began removing thousands of videos displaying white supremacism and other hateful ideologies . ) Stephan Lewandowsky , chair of the cognitive psychology department at the NNP of Bristol , who studies NN misinformation , VBZ the question is n’t whether NNP MD deal with NN denialism on its platform , but whether there the NN ’s leadership have the JJ will to do so when there is not yet “ JJ consensus ” in all NNS IN NN NN . “ With the radical Islamist and the white supremacist material [ that NNP has been successful in policing ] , they recognized that was something they definitely MD n’t VB away with [ hosting ] , ” he VBZ . “ With NN denial , RB though it is a scientifically totally absurd position , there are plenty of politicians in the U.S. and Australia , for example , who are immersed in this stuff . ” Misinformation IN NN NN and its impacts are still commonplace in some prominent mainstream NN . On Jan. 14 , James Murdoch , son of Australian NN mogul Rupert Murdoch , criticized the “ ongoing denial ” of the NN NN displayed by his father ’s NN outlets , particularly in coverage of Australia ’s current bushfire NN . For Lewandowsky , the promotion of NN denialism , both in the NN and to NNP NNS searching for NN about NN NN , creates a major stumbling block to JJ momentum on cutting NN gas NNS . “ For JJ NNS who are not trained NNS , ” he VBZ , “ the moment they ’re exposed to what appears to be a scientific debate — but is n’t actually , because the NN was settled a JJ NN ago — they feel they can VB “ Oh , well , the NNS do n’t agree on this — we do n’t have to do anything . ” Sign up for CD .

The_DT above_JJ article_NN is_VBZ from_IN Wattsupwiththat.com_NNP ._. Visit_VB Wattsupwiththat.com_ADD for_IN more_JJR great_JJ articles_NNS ._.","The real NN debate is not between “ believers ” and “ deniers ” . And not between Republicans and Democrats . The real debate is certainly not over whether JJ NN , spurred by increasing NN gases , is a serious problem that must be addressed . Both sides of the real NN debate agree on that . The real rebate is between CD groups : 1 . A confident , non-political group that believes technology , informed investments , rational decision making , and the use of the best scientific NN will lead to a solution of the JJ NN issue . An optimistic group that sees JJ NN as a technical problem with technical solutions . I will refer to these folks as the ACT group ( Apolitical / Confident / Technical ) 2 . A group , mainly on the JJ left , that is highly partisan , anxious and often despairing , self - righteous , JJ on blame and JJ justice , and willing to attack those that disagree with them . They often distort the truth when it serves their interests . They RB VBP JJ NN as necessary for dealing with JJ NN , requiring the very reorganization of society . I call these folks the ASP group ( Anxious , JJ - Justice , Partisan ) . There is no better NN to VB the profound difference between these CD groups than to watch a NN of the testimony of young activists at the recent NNP Hearing on NNP NNP , which included Greta Thunberg , Jamie Margolin , Vic Barrett , and Benji Backer . Jamie Margolin of Seattle talked about an apocalyptic future , with “ corporations making billions ” while they destroy the future of her generation . Of feeling fear and despair . Of a NN where the natural environment is undergoing collapse , where only a few NNS are left before we pass the point of no return , and where only a massive JJ shift can fix things , including the Green NNP Deal . Watch her testimony to VB what I mean . Compare Ms. Margolin ’s testimony to that of NNP of NNP senior Benji Backer . Mr. Backer , leader of the NNP Conservation Coalition , a conservative / moderate group of young NNS supporting NN to protect the environment , approaches the problem in a radically JJ NN . Instead of despair , there is optimism , recommending more scientific and technical research , a bipartisan attack on the problem , a rejection of an apocalyptic future , the building of JJ NN industries with potential benefits for the JJ economy , and a dedication to follow the NN and not JJ expediency . His testimony is here . Both Ms. Margolin and Mr. Backer care deeply about the environment and VBP effective measures to deal with JJ NN . Both their approaches and attitudes MD not be more JJ . We VBP the difference between the optimistic ACT group and the despairing ASP folks here in Seattle . On CD hand , there is the Clean Tech Alliance , which brings together technology NNS , NN researchers , and the business community to develop and apply the technologies that will produce the NN - free future we look for . Headed by Tom Ranken , the Alliance does a lot , including a highly informative breakfast series where you can learn about fusion NN , JJ battery technologies , the future of solid waste recycling , and much more . Non-political , optimistic , and exciting . These are clearly members of the ACT group . In contrast , there is Seattle ’s 350.org group . They are into NN strikes , staging protests ( IN their recent blockade of a branch of Seattle Chase Bank ) , trying to muzzle NN NNS they do n’t VB , advocating JJ solutions to NN NN ( Green NNP Deal ) , pushing divestment of NN NNS , and RB a Pledge of Resistance to stop NN exports by whatever means necessary . Their “ NN ” page has all kinds of extreme ( and unfounded ) claims regarding JJ NN impacts , IN a NN level rise of CD NNS in as little as 50 NNS . ASP group all the NN . I should note that the Seattle 350.org group and their “ allies ” oppose the Tacoma Liquid Natural Gas ( LNG ) Facility that will VB replace the extraordinarily dirty “ bunker fuel ” VBN in ships traversing Puget Sound . LNG will RB reduce NN NNS . NNS and regulators at the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency support the LNG facility . But facts and protection of the NN of Puget Sound residents are not priorities for highly politicized groups IN 350.org . A good example of the differences between the ACT and ASP folks is VBN in NNP NNP ’s recent NN initiatives . Initiative 732 was backed by NNP NNP , a non-political group whose bi-partisan proposal MD have increased the NN of NN fuels but was revenue neutral , giving all the funds collected back to the citizens of the NNP . Carefully designed and impactful . The work of the ACT group all the NN . But the ASP folks were unhappy . There was no NN for their NN justice and JJ initiatives , so they opposed it , and were joined by Governor Inslee and the JJ left . Unforgivable , nasty attacks were made on NNP NNP leadership by the ASP folks . 732 lost . The ASP collective decided it was their turn , so they created a Frankenstein NN initiative ( 1631 ) , with a lowered ( less effective ) NN fee , but CD in which NN justice groups and JJ allies on the left MD have NN , and were hardwired for much of the funds . The main advertising line of the 1631 ads : catastrophe was IN the corner and the JJ oil NNS were to blame . 1631 was an NN day disaster , losing by 13 points , and the ASP folks have probably killed any hope for an effective NN tax / fee in our NN . What about the NN ? Which side are they on ? ASP or ACT or neither ? Much of the “ mainstream ” NN parrots the message of the ASP side . The Seattle Times is a great NN in point , with headlines of massive heat related deaths ( 750 die per event ! ) and catastrophic wildfire seasons that have no basis in good NN . But there are plenty of others , such as the LA Times and the NY Times . There are some major NN outlets that are more balanced ( such as the Wall Street Journal ) . A major issue for the NN is the hollowing out of NN reporting , with most NN stories being handled by general reporters with neither the NN , background , or inclination to VB beyond parroting the press releases of activist groups or evaluating the claims of speculative research papers . It has gotten so bad that a recent headline story in the Seattle Times kept on talking about the WRONG GAS ( NN monoxide instead of NN dioxide ) . A Religious Movement In JJ ways , the ASP group appears to be a religious movement , not unlike the JJ millennialist movements of the past . As other groups in the past , they predict an apocalyptic future ( including fire and brimstone ! ) and that PRP must “ VB ” in their viewpoint or be rejected as a “ denier . ” The ASP folks have a holy viewpoint that comes from authority ( they claim VBN on the views of 97 % of NNS ) . There is no debate allowed , the NN is “ settled . ” Sounds IN religious dogma . The ASP movement describes a NN that is teetering on the edge , with mankind ’s days numbers ( CD or 12 NNS according to several of their leading prophets ) unless immediate steps are taken . They constantly repeat that the threat is existential . They VBP it is ok to distort the truth to VB folks “ to do the JJ thing . ” The ASP group has well defined “ enemies ” that represent JJ evil ( NNP , Republicans , NNP Oil , Koch Brothers ) and they support attacking and silencing those they disagree with ( my past blog gives you some documented examples of such behavior ) . ASP has their priests ( NNP Gore , NNP McKibben , Michael Mann ) and RB young saints ( Greta Thunberg ) . As in JJ such movements , members are guided to act in approved and enlightened ways , but the leadership does not VB to follow the rules ( e.g. , JJ ASP “ leaders ” have huge NN footprints from flying ) . Importantly , ASP sees their work VBG much further than a technical fix for technical problem , but as a “ JJ justice ” movement that will VB the very organization of society . Disturbingly , the ASP folks are against key technologies that MD RB make a difference , such as nuclear NN , and are relatively uninterested in working on NN and resilience to NN NN . JJ do not support dealing with our forests in a rational NN ( e.g. , restoration with thinning and prescribed burning ) but MD rather blame it all on JJ NN . By pushing a highly JJ agenda the ASP movement is undermining bipartisan efforts–and nothing important will be done unless both sides of the aisle are involved . ASP folks love to VB that the Republicans are unwilling to deal with NN NN , a totally unfair claim . I have talked personally to leading WA Republicans , IN NNP Bryant and Rob McKenna . They acknowledge the seriousness of JJ NN and the NN to act . In my talks in highly Republican eastern NNP , growers and others accept the problem and VBP to work on solutions . Under a Republican U.S. Congress , funding for NN research has been protected and increased . But partisan attacks by the ASP group is seen as a NN to promote group cohesion and the “ evil ” of the other side . Calling others names is not an effective NN to secure their cooperation . A problem for the ASP group is that their message is so dark , pessimistic and depressing that it tends to turn others off . And it has a terrible psychological effects on its adherents and those that listen . Fear , anxiety , feelings of hopelessness , despair , and rage . There are RB classes on dealing with eco-anxiety and NN grief . Greta Thunberg VBD that the worry ruined her childhood . And yes , there is NNP NNP . Much of what he VBZ on NN NN is simply nonsensical , and quite frankly he is not part of the debate . Republicans in Congress do not follow his lead . But he is a convenient foil for the ASP folks , who use him for their own purposes . The Bottom Line Progress on NN NN is being undermined by the efforts of the highly vocal , partisan , and ineffective ASP group . They are standing in the NN of bipartisan NN on NN NN , efforts to fix our forests , and the use of essential technologies . They are a JJ part of the problem , not the solution . In contrast to the ASP folks , the ACT group generally tries to stay out of the JJ eye , quietly completing the work needed to develop the technologies and infrastructure that will allow us to mitigate and adapt to NN NN . In the end , they will save us . That is , if the ASP folks do n’t VB in their NN . The above article is from Wattsupwiththat.com . Visit Wattsupwiththat.com for more great articles ."

The NN and stories that matter , delivered weekday mornings . Traffic - free roads , plane - free skies and widespread brick - and - mortar closings have made the NN a beneficiary of the NN NN — but only in the short term . Li Shuo , senior NN and NN policy officer at Greenpeace in Beijing , VBD it 's not NN to "" pop the champagne corks "" just yet . "" It 's hardly a sustainable NN to reduce NNS , "" he VBD . JJ NN experts spotlighted 2020 as a critical NN to take decisive NN to limit the worst impacts of JJ NN . The NN started with international attention on catastrophic wildfires and floods . The NN has overshadowed those issues — but with an JJ silver lining . The sharp reductions documented in NN NNS and air pollution caused by NN - related lockdowns have offered a sort of preview of the kind of improvements that can be made when drastic NN is taken . But the NNS MD easily be wiped out by efforts to quickly ramp up economies , including governments IN the NN that MD be more willing to relax regulations to jump - start NNS . Despite an estimate showing that NNP — the NN 's biggest polluter — emitted 25 percent less NN than in the same four - week period the previous NN , Shuo remains skeptical about any lasting NNS . He VBD he 's worried that efforts to reignite NNP 's economy might end up making the NN epidemic a step backward for NN efforts . That 's because if history is anything to VB by , NNP might not take the greenest option . Lauri Myllyvirta , lead analyst at the Centre for Research on NNP and Clean Air , VBN in Finland , VBD NNP responded to the 2008 financial NN with the "" biggest , dirtiest stimulus program in the history of mankind . "" "" It meant that for the following three NNS there was rapid growth in CO2 NNS , and we can now VB with quite a bit of certainty that the overall impact was to nudge NNP on a more NN - intensive , fossil fuel - intensive economy path , "" Myllyvirta VBD . How other nations handle their responses to the JJ shock will RB be critical . There are some glimmers of hope that ambitious NN NN MD play a part . European Union leaders have VBN the recently announced Green Deal must be at the heart of an "" intelligent recovery . "" In spite of pressure to soften its green ambitions because of the NN , the EU has begun a consultation on tightening its NN reduction targets by 2030 . Things look less promising in the U.S. Last week , the NNP Protection Agency confirmed that the NNP administration had relaxed enforcement of regulations to VB polluting industries deal with the NN . Gina McCarthy , who directed the EPA in the administration of NNP Barack Obama , called the announcement "" a license to pollute . "" Meanwhile , some industries in the U.S. and Europe are pushing to relax other regulations . The plastics industry , recently on its back NN over ocean pollution fears , has worked to turn the tide on plastic bag bans . Although the NN is far from clear , plastic makers have RB argued that single - use plastics are safer and more sanitary than reusable alternatives . Plastics Industry Association CEO Tony Radosewski recently stressed the NN for more single - use plastics to combat the spread of the NN in a letter March 18 to the U.S. Department of NNP and NNP Services . And it seems that JJ lawmakers are listening . Plastic bag restrictions have been lifted across the country . In NNP NNP and Maine , recently introduced bans have been delayed . In Connecticut , plastic bag fees have been removed , while in NNP Hampshire , Gov. Chris Sununu prohibited shoppers from bringing reusable bags and ordered stores to make disposable bags available . Likewise , the NN has been a boon for the auto industry , with the NNP administration seizing the moment to fulfill a campaign promise to weaken Obama - era NNS standards . Automakers in the EU are RB lobbying for a delay in tightening NNS restrictions because of the NN . And in NNP , plans for tougher standards look likely to be delayed to VB struggling automakers . Airlines including Delta and JetBlue started off the NN promising NN offsets amid a growing culture of "" flight shaming . "" The airline industry is RB lobbying for NN bailouts and regulation relief . Download the NBC NNP app for full coverage and alerts about the NN outbreak With governments focused on the NN , there are RB fears that the diplomatic push to refocus JJ efforts on reducing NNS MD slip . The NNP Nations ' COP 26 NN conference , scheduled to be held in Glasgow , Scotland , in November , has been postponed until 2021 . It had been hailed as the most important NN gathering since the Paris NN accord was signed in 2015 . Under that agreement , NNS are due to come back to the table with JJ pledges to limit NN to the agreed - upon level of "" well below 2 degrees "" Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) and ideally below 1.5 degrees . It 's "" abundantly clear that the NNS of the NN are falling short of the goals of the Paris agreement , "" VBD Dr. Simon Evans , deputy editor of NNP Brief , a NN NN website . "" Current pledges have the NN on track for NN of about 3 degrees "" Celsius , he added . Environmentalists have already raised concerns after Japan — the NN 's fifth - biggest emitter — became the JJ G7 country to announce its JJ targets . The plan , however , MD simply maintain the country 's existing emission reduction pledges . The NNP Resources Institute , a research nonprofit VBN in NNP , criticized the approach for falling "" woefully short . "" A successful outcome in Glasgow , therefore , looks likely to require extensive preparatory work and diplomacy . As Evans VBD , the Paris agreement was "" built on NNS of diplomatic efforts on the part of the French NN and the whole French diplomatic service over the course of about three NNS . "" Although the postponement of the NN conference does provide welcome extra NN for work toward a successful summit , he argued that it is "" inevitable that NNS ' preparatory work toward their JJ pledges "" will have been affected . So while the NN looks likely to emerge from the NN — at least temporarily — with cleaner air and lower NNS , "" any positive JJ impact "" from the NN relies on our "" changing our production and consumption habits towards cleaner and greener , "" Inger Andersen , executive director of the U.N. Environment Program , wrote this week . "" Only JJ - term systemic shifts will VB the trajectory of CO2 levels in the atmosphere , "" she VBD ."

The purpose of this article and Jones ’ message is to raise JJ awareness of how the globalists are VBG terrorism to take our rights – from 2nd Amendment gun grabbing to 4th Amendment airport body scanners . These NNP insiders VBD Jones that three months ago “ sources outside of NNP NNP ” threatened North Korean leader Kim Jong - un to surrender or EMP ( electromagnetic pulse ) weapons MD be detonated over JJ cities NNP NNP and Los Angeles , Riyadh ( the capital of Saudi Arabia ) , and London ( the capital of England ) . The NN grid MD blink out in an instant , catapulting affected regions back to the days before electric utilities . Deprived of grocery stores and the means to cook food , civil unrest MD be inevitable . As JJ investigative journalist and lawyer Alfred Henry Lewis put it , in 1906 : “ There are only nine meals between mankind and anarchy . ” Staggering JJ losses coupled with societal rioting MD lead to a JJ limited nuclear NN , between North Korea and NNP , provoking the western nations to retaliate in kind against North Korea . The globalists MD hide out in their underground bunkers for a NN before emerging to the NN they envision , with only half a CD NNS to VB . The globalists have planned all along to use North Korea to start NN in the South NNP NNP which MD then spread to the rest of the NN . Meanwhile , NNP was making his own plans for peace and prosperity by opening unprecedented peace talks with Kim Jong - un . CD chief requirement MD be for North Korea to stop their nuclear arms program . To achieve this end , NNP was willing to use force , if necessary . Jones ’ sources indicated that the Commander - in - Chief was prepared to “ strike them in March 2018 if he did n’t roll over . ” In a secret meeting held either March 31 or April 1 , NNP director and Secretary of NNP nominee Mike Pompeo to open negotiations with the North Korean leader . Afterward , NNP tweeted success , underscoring the “ lightning pace ” of the JJ diplomatic relationship between the CD NNS : “ Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed . Details of Summit are being worked out now . Denuclearization will be a great thing for NNP , but RB for North Korea ! ” On April 20 , 2018 , mainstream NN sources IN NBC NNP broadcast stunning NN : Kim Jong - Un announced that North Korea “ has suspended nuclear and JJ - range missile tests , claiming further tests are unnecessary ” because his country has “ reached the target stage , where the nation and NNS ’s safety is reliably secured . ” After all the saber rattling we ’ve heard from Kim Jong - Un in recent NNS , this proclamation seems odd – unless we factor in NNP ’s alleged threat to ( effectively ) sue for peace by VBG the threat of force . NNP ’s refusal to VB along with the globalist plan effectively makes him – and all freedom - loving Patriots – a target . Jones repeated his warning : the globalists have threatened to use satellite - VBN EMP weapons to shut off all the electricity and create starvation . They will blame North Korea in the hopes of triggering a much bigger NN , which , in turn , will be VBN to justify the creation of a JJ JJ NN , currency , and NN force – with no more Constitutional freedoms as we VBP them today . NN is NN . Spread the word that NN - mad , self - serving JJ elites are plotting to undermine the NNP administration ’s peace - seeking diplomacy with North Korea . They plan to use terrorist sleeper cell attacks this coming summer to make North Korea a scape - goat in order to prevent progress toward cooperation among nations . It is NN for all sincere Patriots to wake up . IN Paul Revere , share the impending danger with everyone you VBP , not to foster fear , but to :"

A range of alternative NNS scenarios VBN as representative concentration pathways ( RCPs ) were proposed by the IPCC in the Fifth Assessment Report ( AR5 ) , which was published in 2014 , to examine potential future NN NNS . The scenarios depend on various assumptions concerning future rates of JJ population growth , JJ development , NN demand , technological advancement , and other factors . Unlike the scenarios VBN in previous IPCC assessments , the AR5 RCPs explicitly account for NN NN mitigation efforts . Graph of the predicted increase in the concentration of NN dioxide ( CO 2 ) in NNP 's atmosphere according to a series of NN NN scenarios that assume JJ levels of JJ development , population growth , and fossil fuel use . The results of each scenario in the IPCC ’s Fourth Assessment Report ( 2007 ) are depicted in the graph . The AR5 scenario with the smallest increases in NN gases is RCP 2.6 , which denotes the net radiative forcing by 2100 in watts per square metre ( a doubling of CO concentrations from preindustrial values of 280 ppm to 560 ppm represents roughly 3.7 watts per square metre ) . RCP 2.6 assumes substantial improvements in NN efficiency , a rapid transition away from fossil fuel NN , and a JJ population that peaks at roughly nine CD NNS in the 21st century . In that scenario CO concentrations remain below 450 ppm and actually fall toward the end of the century ( to about 420 ppm ) as a result of widespread deployment of NN - capture technology . Scenario RCP 8.5 , by contrast , might be described as “ business as usual . ” It reflects the assumption of an NN - intensive JJ economy , high population growth , and a reduced rate of technological development . CO concentrations are more than three times greater than preindustrial levels ( roughly 936 ppm ) by 2100 and continue to grow thereafter . RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 envision intermediate policy choices , resulting in stabilization by 2100 of CO concentrations at 538 and 670 ppm , respectively . In all those scenarios , the cooling effect of industrial pollutants such as sulfate particulates , which have masked some of the past century ’s NN , is assumed to decline to near zero by 2100 because of policies restricting their industrial production . The differences between the various simulations arise from disparities between the various NN models VBN and from assumptions made by each emission scenario . For example , best estimates of the predicted increases in JJ NN NN between the NNS 2000 and 2100 range from about 0.3 to 4.8 °C ( 0.5 to 8.6 °F ) , depending on which emission scenario is assumed and which NN model is VBN . Relative to preindustrial ( i.e. , 1750 – 1800 ) NNS , these estimates reflect an overall NN of the globe of 1.4 to 5.0 °C ( 2.5 to 9.0 °F ) . These projections are conservative in that they do not take into account potential positive NN cycle feedbacks ( VB above Feedback mechanisms and NN sensitivity ) . Only the lower - end NNS scenario RCP 2.6 has a reasonable chance ( roughly 50 percent ) of holding additional JJ NN NN by 2100 to less than 2.0 °C ( 3.6 °F ) — a level considered by JJ NNS to be the threshold above which pervasive and extreme climatic effects will occur . The greatest increase in near - NN air NN is projected to occur over the polar region of the Northern Hemisphere because of the melting of NN NN and the associated reduction in NN albedo . Greater NN is predicted over land areas than over the ocean . Largely due to the delayed NN of the oceans and their greater specific heat , the Northern Hemisphere — with less than 40 percent of its NN area covered by NN — is expected to warm faster than the Southern Hemisphere . Some of the regional variation in predicted NN is expected to arise from NNS to wind patterns and ocean currents in response to NN NN . For example , the NN of the region of the North Atlantic Ocean just south of Greenland is expected to be slight . This anomaly is projected to arise from a weakening of warm northward ocean currents combined with a shift in the jet stream that will bring colder polar air masses to the region . projected NNS in mean NN NNS Projected NNS in mean NN NNS by the late 21st century according to the A1B NN NN scenario . All values for the period 2090 – 99 are shown relative to the mean NN values for the period 1980 –99 . Learn how the Netherlands have combatted rising NN levels and flooding disasters with the Delta project VB all videos for this article The NN NNS associated with JJ NN are RB projected to lead to NNS in precipitation patterns across the globe . Increased precipitation is predicted in the polar and subpolar regions , whereas decreased precipitation is projected for the middle latitudes of both hemispheres as a result of the expected poleward shift in the jet streams . Whereas precipitation near the Equator is predicted to increase , it is thought that rainfall in the subtropics will decrease . Both phenomena are associated with a forecasted strengthening of the tropical Hadley cell pattern of atmospheric circulation . projected NNS in mean precipitation Projected NNS in mean precipitation by the late 21st century according to the A1B NN NN scenario . All values for the period 2090 – 99 are shown as a percentage relative to the mean precipitation values for the period 1980 – 99 . NNS in precipitation patterns are expected to increase the chances of both drought and flood conditions in JJ areas . Decreased summer precipitation in North NNP , Europe , and Africa , combined with greater rates of evaporation due to NN NN NNS , is projected to lead to decreased soil moisture and drought in JJ regions . Furthermore , since anthropogenic NN NN will likely lead to a more vigorous hydrologic cycle with greater rates of both evaporation and precipitation , there will be a greater probability for intense precipitation and flooding in JJ regions . Regional predictions of future NN NN remain limited by uncertainties in how the precise patterns of atmospheric winds and ocean currents will vary with increased NN NN . For example , some uncertainty remains in how the frequency and magnitude of El Niño / Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) events will adjust to NN NN . Since ENSO is CD of the most prominent sources of interannual variations in regional patterns of precipitation and NN , any uncertainty in how it will VB implies a corresponding uncertainty in certain regional patterns of NN NN . For example , increased El Niño activity MD likely lead to more winter precipitation in some regions , such as the desert southwest of the NNP NNPS . This might offset the drought predicted for those regions , but at the same NN it might lead to less precipitation in other regions . Rising winter precipitation in the desert southwest of the NNP NNPS might exacerbate drought conditions in locations as far away as South Africa ."

The NN , published in the July edition of NNP Affairs , looked at the generic substitution of simvastatin for cholesterol brand drug Zocor over six quarters beginning June 23 , 2006 , when Zocor 's patent expired . The review looked at how quickly Medicaid recipients moved to the generic equivalent medications under three JJ NN statutes – mandatory versus permissive substitution , with and without prior authorization , and with and without requiring patient approval for substitution . The generic substitutions discussed in the NN are for chemically identical generics for brand name drugs . "" Requiring patients to provide consent prior to generic substitution led to an approximately 25 % reduction in generic substitution , "" VBD Dr. William H. Shrank , the NN 's lead author , an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard NNP School in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston . During the six consecutive quarters reviewed , the NN determined that NNS MD have saved almost $ 20 CD if the substitution from Zocor to the chemically - identical simvatstatin were made more quickly for that CD medication . "" This NN has important implications . We determined NNS can stem the rising cost of medications paid for by Medicaid programs by modifying statutes to make it easier to replace brand name medications with generics , "" VBD Troyen A. Brennen , MD , MPH and Executive Vice NN and Chief JJ Officer of CVS Caremark . "" There are JJ brand medications that will lose their patent protection over the next several NNS and , as a consequence , we will VB the introduction of generic equivalents for these brand medications . In particular , we can expect significant activity with the upcoming patent expirations of Lipitor , Plavix and Zyprexa over the next eighteen months . "" The NN estimates NN Medicaid programs can save more than $ 100 CD on those three drugs alone by adopting regulations that allow pharmacists to make a NN following the patent expiration , without requiring direct patient approval . This is NN that policy makers can take immediately to save NN without affecting the quality of pharmacy care , "" he VBD . Brennan VBD cost containment and finding ways to better manage increasing NN care costs is extremely important in the face of the current JJ NN and expected expansion of NN Medicaid programs resulting from federal NN care reform . The NN involved a review of Medicaid claims NNS between June 2006 and 2008 in 48 NNS and the District of Columbia . The NN published in NNP Affairs is the result of CVS Caremark 's previously announced three - NN collaboration with Harvard NNP and Brigham and Women 's Hospital to research pharmacy claims NNS to better understand patient behavior IN medication adherence and appropriate medication use . In addition , earlier this NN the NN launched a Behavior NNP Research Partnership with academic leaders from Carnegie Mellon NNP , Dartmouth College 's Tuck School of Business and the NNP of Pennsylvania 's NNP School and Wharton School of Business to develop insights into consumer actions IN NN challenges through the lens of behavioral economics and JJ marketing . CVS Caremark is undertaking these studies because patient non-adherence to essential chronic medications is widely recognized as a barrier to improving JJ NN and a NN of increasing JJ costs . Past studies show CD - quarter of NNS receiving prescriptions never fill their JJ prescription , and patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and coronary artery NN adhere to their ongoing medication regimen about half of the NN . Non-adherence to essential medications is a frequent NN of preventable hospitalizations and patient illness , with costs to the U.S. NN care NN estimated at about $ 300 CD annually . CVS Caremark is the largest pharmacy NN care provider in the NNP NNPS . Through our integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care , we are uniquely positioned to provide greater access , to engage plan members in behaviors that improve their NN and to lower overall NN care costs for NN plans , plan sponsors and their members . CVS Caremark is a NN leader in mail order pharmacy , retail pharmacy , specialty pharmacy , and retail clinics , and is a leading provider of Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans . As CD of the country 's largest pharmacy benefits managers ( PBMs ) , we provide access to a network of more than 64,000 pharmacies , including approximately 7,000 CVS / pharmacy ® stores that provide unparalleled service and capabilities . Our clinical expertise includes CD of the industry 's most comprehensive NN management programs .

But between 1961 and 2010 , the country - to - country gap MD have narrowed more if not for NN NN , VBZ JJ research published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The difference between the richest and poorest NNS in the NN is some 25 percent wider than it MD be in a NN without JJ NN , the authors VBP . Until now , we did n't have a number that showed “ how much the JJ NN that 's already happened has impacted the growth of existing NNS , and the harm that ’s already occurred , "" VBZ Noah Diffenbaugh , an author of the NN and a NN scientist at Stanford NNP . And critically , he VBZ , “ The NNS that are most responsible for JJ NN are JJ from the NNS that are bearing the brunt of JJ NN . ” Economists , development experts , and NN leaders have RB warned that NN NN is likely to hurt poor NNS more than rich ones . Recovering from disasters IN hurricanes or floods or drought is more challenging when resources are thin , and extra heat hurts more when NNS and crops are already near their limits — the NN for JJ NNS in the NN - sensitive tropics . “ So RB without this added JJ penalty , those poorer places MD bear the brunt of NN NN , ” VBZ Amir Jina , an JJ policy expert at the NNP of Chicago . Much of the research on the JJ and JJ impacts of NN NN looked into the future , NNS or decades or centuries ahead . But in recent NNS , NNS have begun to tease out exact calculations of how much NN NN has already affected us . In 2017 , for example , they established that Hurricane Harvey dumped about 15 percent more rain than it MD have in an un-climate - changed NN . Diffenbaugh and Marshall Burke , the authors of the JJ NN , realized they MD apply the same kind of approach to economies . Burke and colleagues had shown a few NNS prior that there is a remarkable relationship between the average annual NN in a country and its JJ output . Places whose NN hovered RB 13 degrees Celsius , or about 55 degrees Fahrenheit ( IN NNP and the U.S. ) , have the highest JJ productivity in the NN . The farther away from that peak a country was , the less productive they were . It did n't matter if a country was rich or poor : The Goldilocks - esque relationship held . Colder NNS did n't produce as much . Nor did hotter NNS , and their JJ penalty was RB greater , especially when average NNS crept above 20 degrees Celsius , or 68 degrees Fahrenheit . The exact reasons why this relationship existed are still being worked out , and there ’s no CD factor that controls the effect globally . In some NNS , hotter NNS MD make it harder for NNS to work , and in others , it MD affect the agricultural output , amongst JJ other effects . But the overall pattern is clear . And it suggested an obvious next question : As the NN warmed over the past decades , had colder NNS benefited economically ? And were hotter NNS paying a penalty ? How much of the stubborn inequality between NNS can be ascribed to NN NN ? Who ’s fault is NN NN ? And who pays the NN ? Globally , JJ inequality — the difference between the poorest NNS and the richest NNS — has narrowed over past decades ( by CD measure , it dropped by about 15 percent between 1975 and 2010 ) . But what Diffenbaugh and Burke VBD was that between 1961 to 2010 , that gap MD have narrowed by about 25 percent more , had JJ NN not been a factor . The penalty was particularly acute for tropical NNS , which were already on the hotter end of the spectrum and far more sensitive to increases in heat . But the researchers RB VBD something else in the NN : JJ of the NNS in the temperate Goldilocks zone , which already tended to be richer , had RB seemed to gain some slight ineffable JJ benefit from the NN . As NNS in JJ of those NNS crept up , so did their JJ output . The NN looks only at the relationship between NN and JJ measures , but does not dig in to identify the underlying reasons they might be connected , cautions Solomon Hsiang , an expert in NN and development at the NNP of California , Berkeley . Without those direct links , and without thinking about how past NN MD have impacts that play out on longer timescales ( the authors primarily focused on immediate JJ responses to NN , within a NN ) , it ’s premature to VB that any NNS have benefited from NN NN , he VBZ . And in fact , there is growing NN that NN NN hurts all NNS , both rich and poor — so the JJ advantages seen here are likely to dissipate . In contrast , the 18 NNS with the lowest CO2 NNS per person ( less than CD tons per person in total over the NNS between 1961 to 2010 , or about as much as the average NNP blows through in about seven and a half months today ) , took JJ hits of over 25 percent . “ We already knew that the NNS most vulnerable to NN NN did not contribute much to NNS that caused that same NN NN , ” VBZ Celine Guivarch , a NN NN and policy expert at CIRED , the International Research Center on Environment and Development , in Paris . “ We now have the quantification of how much . That has profound implications for justice between NNS VBG forward . ” NN - vulnerable NNS have stressed this point during international NN negotiations . During discussions preceding the Paris NNP Agreement , in 2015 , Indian delegates pressed for “ NN reparations ” from the wealthy NNS who were responsible for the bulk of the NN - VBG CO2 NNS in the past . And a coalition of island nations , led by the Marshall Islands , fought hard to VB the richer , less - threatened nations to aim to keep VBG below 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) by 2100 , rather than the 2 degrees Celsius goal that had dominated the early part of the negotiations . NN NN is likely to cost everyone , everywhere , especially as its effects ramp up , Diffenbaugh is careful to point out . And he stresses that their analysis does n’t explicitly address the costs of disasters , NN and mitigation , and JJ other factors that MD wipe out JJ gains in the future ."

Basically , nothing is being done to halt this NN despite all the beautiful words and promises from our elected officials . ” She added that “ it should not be this NN ” , but the “ uncomfortable truth ” was being swept “ under the rug ” for “ NNS to clean up . ” “ Activism works , so I am telling you to act . We are being betrayed by those in NN . They are failing us , but we will not back down . And if you feel threatened by that , then I have some very bad NN for you : we will not be silenced because we are the NN , and NN is coming whether you VBP it or not , ” she VBD , before thanking the crowd and telling them , “ let ’s march . ” Earlier explaining why she chose to visit Bristol , the activist VBD it was for “ JJ JJ reasons . ” “ The movement is very strong here and I had contact with NNS who were here , ” she VBD , before adding that she hoped the event MD be a “ gathering of NNS standing together in solidarity . ” Last month , Greta Thunberg responded to Meat Loaf ’s claims that she has been “ brainwashed ” into believing in NN NN .

NN records are broken , and broken again , the extent of polar NN melt exceeds expectations , while efforts to cut NNS lag behind targets . And 2019 was no exception . Yet something else happened this NN . Dire warnings by the IPCC and other experts , images of blazing forests and NN of mass biodiversity loss helped make 2019 a NN of NN activism . Greta Thunberg 's school strike went JJ , JJ protests stepped up a gear and NNS began talking not of NN NN but a NN NN and a NN emergency . These were some of the defining NN events and images that made 2019 the NN of NN consciousness . Fires raged across the NN throughout 2019 , wiping out biodiversity and releasing the NN stored in trees and plants . This was the NN we saw the Amazon burn IN never before and flames sweep the Arctic tundra . Here are some of the most devastating wildfires that occurred in 2019 . In 2019 , the average air NNS in the Arctic were almost 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit ) above normal . NNS in Greenland reached highs of over 17 degrees Celsius ( 63 degrees Fahrenheit ) in June , causing rapid NN - sheet melting . A photograph of huskies pulling sleds through ankle - deep meltwaters on a Greenland NN sheet powerfully illustrated this . It was taken by a Danish climatologist whose work in Greenland was made difficult and dangerous by the rapidly changing conditions . This NN , the summer melt was the second - lowest level ever recorded . The 13 lowest NN NN extents in the satellite record have all occurred in the last 13 NNS , according to the annual Arctic Report Card by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) in the NNP NNPS . And that has JJ repercussions . The Arctic works as a giant freezer for the NN . Arctic snow and NN reflects the NN 's NN back into NN , cooling the entire NN . But as the NN retreats , a vicious cycle is set in motion . With less snow and NN on the NN , more heat is absorbed by the ocean , which is further accelerating NN loss . On top of this , the Arctic itself MD now be contributing to NN NN . The frozen ground of the Arctic , RB VBN as permafrost , contains lots of NN which is released when it starts to thaw . This NN then turns into a NN gas , which so far has been absorbed by plant NN growing in the summer , but this NN it has started escaping into the atmosphere . Thawing Arctic permafrost MD be releasing as much NN as Japan . Meanwhile , Arctic animals — IN the polar bear — are losing habitat . This NN , starving polar bears were snapped scavenging for food in a Russian village hundreds of NNS from their natural habitat , making for a startling image of our impact on nature coming home . Another polar bear NN to VB viral this NN was of a young , emaciated animal that was washed up in a Russian village on a piece of NN , exhausted by its search for food . NN NN is n't just threatening wild habitats . JJ research published this NN shows that rising seas MD affect three times more NNS by 2050 than previously thought . Some 150 CD NNS are currently living on land that MD be submerged by mid-century . A quarter of the current population of Vietnam , for instance , live on land , such as Ho Chi Minh City , that will likely be inundated . In Thailand , that figure stands at more than CD % of the population . Cities IN Mumbai , Shanghai and Bangkok MD RB be wiped out . With all this bad NN , it 's perhaps no surprise that 2019 saw NN NN loom larger than ever in JJ consciousness . And that awareness spurred unprecedented NN . On August 20 , 2018 a lone teenage activist – Greta Thunberg – skipped school to demand the Swedish NN act on NN NN . A week later she was joined by fellow students , teachers and NNS in Sweden . By March 2019 , the movement had exploded across the globe , with students in 135 NNS demanding their governments take NN and forcing adults to confront the deeply uncomfortable image of a generation of NNS in fear for their future . Fridays for Future students were soon joined by NNPS for Future , NNPS for Future and Teachers for Future . On September 20 , the largest NN strike yet saw some 4 CD NNS of all ages take to the streets in more than 150 NNS . Alongside Fridays for Future , the JJ name in NN activism this NN was Extinction Rebellion . The movement started in the NNP Kingdom in 2018 but IN Fridays for Future , it went JJ in 2019 and now has groups in some 70 NNS IN the NN . Inspired by grassroots movements IN Occupy and the non-violence of Gandhi and Rosa Parks , Extinction Rebellion is VBG CD step further than waving banners and has turned to civil disobedience to drive their message home . They have paralyzed traffic by blocking some of the busiest roads in major cities and unloaded a heap of horse manure in front of the Madrid NN talks . They 've colored a local river in Zurich acid green , sprayed the British Treasury with gallons of JJ NN and interrupted a Brexit debate with the buttocks of semi-naked protesters facing the chamber of the NNP of Commons . What they are most VBN for , though , is their "" die-ins , "" where hundreds of NNS swarm JJ squares to collapse to the ground , symbolizing the deaths humanity faces if politicians do n't do something , fast . CD of Extinction Rebellion 's core demands is that governments declare a "" NN emergency . "" Oxford Dictionary chose the phrase as Word of the NNP 2019 , defining the term as "" a situation in which urgent NN is required to reduce or halt NN NN and avoid potentially irreversible JJ damage resulting from it . "" In 2018 , it was on hardly anyone 's radar but in 2019 , the words were blazoned across banners by protestors and dropped into speeches by politicians , and in November , 11,000 NNS declared a JJ "" NN emergency . "" Hundreds of cities IN the NN , as well as the EU Parliament declared a NN emergency in 2019 , admitting that measures taken thus far to prevent a NN disaster are n't enough and promising to make NN NN policy a priority . Still , declaring a NN emergency is n't legally binding . Some local councils are committing to specific targets — such as reaching net - zero NNS earlier than their national NN plans to — others are more vague in their promise to make NN NN policy a priority and VB the move as sending a message to citizens and the rest of the NN to inspire NN from the bottom up . And local and grassroots NN MD be more important than ever , after the disappointing outcome of this NN 's COP25 NN conference . Governments were expected to collectively agree on a deal to cut NN gas NNS more rapidly . Yet the concluding resolution only endorsed the "" urgent NN "" to close the gap between existing NNS pledges and the goals set at the 2015 Paris Agreement . Brazil , NNP , Australia , Saudi Arabia and the NNP NNPS reportedly led resistance to bolder NN ."

Developing NNS , places with widespread poverty , and NNS with ineffective governments sometimes face the gravest risks from the changing NN , and are usually poorly equipped to find ways to prepare for and prevent JJ threats . Measuring the future impact of NN NN is very challenging , because NNS ’ NN NN projections cannot be completely exact and because there are JJ JJ factors that come into play such as the NN of extreme NN events and rising NNS . There are other non-climatic factors that RB determine how severely a city or country will be impacted by NN NN . Niall Smith , who analyzes regions ’ NN NN vulnerability for the JJ NN consulting firm Maplecroft , tells NN that it ’s RB necessary to weigh in what ’s happening politically and socially in a region to figure out if the country can prepare . “ The places with the least level of JJ development are certainly in line to feel the impacts with the greatest degree , partially just due to their geographic fate — or their location — but more so VBN on the socio- JJ and governance factors , ” VBZ Smith . JJ developing NNS are RB uniquely vulnerable , VBZ Kelly Levin of the NNP Resources Institute , “ their livelihoods are dependent on natural resources . And if those natural resources are affected by NN NN , their ability to feed their families and make a living is significantly impacted . ” To VB a sense of the challenges JJ regions are facing , NNP spoke to experts about six NNS and cities will be be particularly affected by NN NN . Lagos is at “ extreme ” NN on Maplecroft ’s NNP NNP Vulnerability Index . This is especially concerning because its population is expanding rapidly , and it is considered to be a major JJ engine for the region . The governor boasted that Lagos had reached a GDP of $ 136 CD in 2017 , which is about a third of the entire country ’s GDP . The city is RB a major transportation hub , with multiple ports and a major international airport and is a regional hub for high tech industry . Lagos has “ transformed ” over the last 18 NNS , Lamido Sanusi , a JJ central bank governor , VBD the Financial last NN In terms of roads , in terms of infrastructure , in terms of a general investment environment , in terms of security , the NN has given NNS a greater opportunity to thrive . ” Lagos is RB at a disadvantage because it ’s considered to be CD of the fastest growing cities in the NN , which will put a “ strain on infrastructure and resources , ” according to Smith . Its population is projected to nearly double over the next 15 NNS , growing from its current population of 13,463,420 to 23,418,770 . In the future , Smith warns that Lagos residents will RB experience more hot days and droughts . NN NN MD threaten the city ’s economy . The city is especially vulnerable because it ’s located on the Gulf of Guinea , VBZ Levin . As NN levels rise , it ’s likely to affect VB coastal erosion and contaminate potable NN . This MD harm local agriculture in the countryside and damage the country ’s fishing industry , which MD be dire in a country with “ tremendous ” poverty , Levin VBZ . “ You MD VB more and more NNS moving in from the countryside because of loss of JJ opportunity into a city IN Lagos , which MD make the whole situation more challenging , ” Levin VBZ . If Lagos struggles , it MD seriously reduce JJ opportunity in the region . NN NN can be a “ threat multiplier , ” VBZ Christina Chan , the director of the NNP Resources Institute ’s NN resilience practice . This is especially JJ for Haiti . The island nation is located in the “ Atlantic Hurricane Basin , ” which means that it is vulnerable to hurricanes . In comparison to other projections on NN NN , NNS are less certain about the link between NN NN and hurricane frequency and intensity , but studies have suggested that hurricanes are likely getting wetter and more intense due to NN NN . Since Haiti is a very poor country , recovering from natural disasters and preparing for future storms is especially challenging . The devastation in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and CD ’s Hurricane Matthew was compounded by the country ’s lack of disaster preparedness . The disasters were major setbacks for the country ’s JJ development ; the $ 8 CD NN tag of recovering from the earthquake surpassed the country ’s GDP , according to the Council on Foreign Relations . The landscape is RB heavily deforested and mountainous , which means it will be more susceptible to landslides . According to Levin , Haiti will RB struggle because the population is dependent on agriculture , and rising NN levels mean that salt NN MD contaminate freshwater . The NNP Nations warns that rising NN levels MD VB saltwater to permeate farmland and freshwater supplies . “ There ’s certainly a JJ portion of Haitians that are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods and income . And if you have overall patterns of rainfall declines as NNS rise , certainly that MD impact farmers , ” Levin VBZ . NNS with weak institutions and governments are likely to find it especially difficult to adapt to NN NN , VBZ Smith . Since civil NN broke out in Yemen in 2015 , hundreds of thousands of NNS have been killed directly as a result of the conflict , but RB due to the subsequent famine , poor sanitation and a lack of clean NN , according to the NNP Nations . About 1.6 CD NNS in Yemen are living with malnutrition in 2019 , according to the UN . Both NN and NN NN will make NN shortages and famine more likely . According to a Untied Nations report , most contemporary famines result from armed conflict and are worsened by natural disasters . As the report explains , “ Parties to the conflict MD use food as a weapon , cutting off food supplies , destroying systems of food production and distribution , and stealing food aid . Agricultural production falls , which both limits the availability of food and cuts off JJ rural houses from their livelihoods . And with higher levels of poverty , JJ families cannot afford the food they VBP , especially at inflated prices . ” Malaria is RB becoming more common in Yemen , and MD be exacerbated by rising NNS . As Yemen has a JJ coast , it ’s RB vulnerable to rising NN levels , according to Levin . An area to watch , VBZ Levin , “ Whenever you ’re thinking about a country in that region … [ is ] the issue of rising NNS impacting NN scarcity , especially when it ’s exacerbated by NN management challenges and expanding population . ” As other NNS work to curb their oil consumption , it MD be a mixed blessing for Yemen , according to Levin . While lower NNS are believed to be necessary to limit NN NN , it MD RB reduce demands for CD of Yemen ’s major imports — oil — which MD impact Yemen ’s economy , Levin VBZ . The Philippines faces a high NN of natural disasters , including earthquakes , tsunamis , floods , and especially hurricanes . Manila , which is located along the coast , is RB densely populated , which makes it more difficult to evacuate , requires more JJ services and makes it more challenging to rebuild after a disaster . Poor infrastructure , including ineffective drainage and sanitation systems , has been blamed for the toll of floods in the city , including a 2009 flood that submerged 80 % of the city . However , Chan VBZ that the Philippines is in fact on the “ forefront of NN ” to NN NN , and have designated part of their budget to making their country ’s agricultural sector and infrastructure more resilient , and preparing to respond to future disasters . For instance , the NN launched a Flood Management Master Plan for Metro Manila in 2012 , which aims to manage future floods by modernizing and building JJ pumping stations and investing in other infrastructure along waterways , according to the Asian Infrastructure investment Bank . The Philippines have created a NNP NNP Commission , which implements programs such as the National NNP NNP NNP Plan , a JJ - term strategy for prioritizing “ food security , NN sufficiency , ecosystem and JJ stability , JJ security , NN smart industries and services , sustainable NN , NN and capacity development . ” Rising NN levels mean that Kiribati MD be wiped off the map entirely in the coming decades . The islands have RB purchased 5,000 acres of land in Fiji in NN they VBP to relocate . While Kitribati , IN JJ other NNS , is taking steps to prepare for NN NN , the Pacific island nation must RB reckon with the fact that “ for their island , NN will have its limits , ” VBZ Chan . The islands are only six NNS above NN level and sit upon a NN of atolls and reef islands , which means that rising NN levels are a threat to the nation ’s existence . This vulnerability has RB spurred Kiribati to take serious steps in NN mitigation . Kiribati has allied itself with other vulnerable island NNS to advocate for NN to fight NN NN , and taken other measures such as planting mangrove trees and building NN walls . Meanwhile , Levin VBZ , rising NN levels are likely to contaminate the island ’s freshwater and harm its soil , which is not especially fertile for agriculture to begin with . The island ’s vital fishing industry is RB more vulnerable , as NN NNS leads to shifts in the ocean , including coral bleaching ; damage to the structure of reefs ; marine “ heat waves ” ; and other conditions that force marine NN to move north . IN JJ of the other places on this list , the NNP Arab Emirates is facing JJ risks due to its location . IN Yemen and other neighboring NNS , the UAE is facing an “ extreme NN ” of NN stress , according to Smith , and will VB to spend a lot more NN on cooling . Unlike JJ other NNS facing these threats , however , the UAE is wealthier and is able to make sophisticated investments to blunt the impact of NN NN . For instance , the UAE is working to produce its own fresh NN , build NN - controlled spaces , investments in green NN , and developing crops that can withstand hotter NNS . However , according to Levin , it remains to be seen whether these adaptations will reach Yemen ’s entire population , because the country faces rampant inequality . “ The question is , will adequate investments be made in NN , and will the poorest be able to enjoy the same kind of comforts as the rest of the population , ” Levin VBZ . “ You can look at the face of a GDP of a given country . But that RB masks tremendous inequality . It ’s hard to necessarily VB that CD country ’s in such a better position to withstand NN impacts . ”"

[ Note : Some words and / or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words / phrases having no exact counterpart . ] … while Australian leftists ( above , on CD NNP 2019 ) collapse in tears IN Hillary NNP supporters did when she lost to NNP . According to this report , with NNP NNP ’s populist wave having captured every nation it has rolled over — the last CD being Italy and Brazil , which means that “ populists have now wrested NN of the NN economy away from the globalists ” — panic stricken leftists within the elite Western NN structure built what they believed was an impenetrable wall to protect themselves during this Blue NNP weekend ’s Australian national NN — the bricks of which were every socialist policy PRP MD imagine them coming up with , and that ranged from promises to tax the rich to death and redistribute their wealth , to enacting draconian NN NN laws to save the NN from being destroyed in 2030 — or 2040 — or 2050 — or whatever date they ’ve finally decided on , but have yet to tell anyone about . Australian socialists in ( above ) march to celebrate their pending NN victory on 17 NNP 2019 In the days and hours leading up the 18 NNP 2019 national NN in Australia , this report continues , all of the opinion polls , mass NN critics and bookmakers declared , without any doubt whatsoever , that all of the signs pointed towards a “ sweeping win ” for these socialists — but none of whom , apparently , had factored into “ their signs ” the devout Christian Prime Minister Scott Morrison having declared that he “ believed in miracles ” — and because of , saw him scoring a stunning surprise victory that was propelled by a populist wave — the “ quiet Australians ” , he termed them — the counterpart force against socialism that has upended politics in the NNP NNPS , Britain and beyond — and whose leader NNP NNP called Prime Minister Morrison immediately after this shocking historic NN victory to congratulate him , and further had his White NNP release a statement stating : “ The CD leaders reaffirmed the critical importance of the longstanding alliance and friendship between the NNP NNPS and Australia , and they pledged to continue their close cooperation on shared priorities ” . NNP Donald NNP aboard Air Force NNP ( above ) accepts Prime Minister Scott Morrison ’s invitation to visit Australia With the Australian NNS having awoken this Sunday morning to the aftermath of their nation ’s socialist forces having “ lost the unloseable NN ” , this report notes , their beyond shocked and stunned leftist elite class have predictably begun lashing out — best exampled by JJ leftist Prime Minister John Howard slamming these socialists ’ approach to the NN as the “ politics of envy ” that divided Australia on class — Griffith NNP in Queensland leftist law professor Susan Harris - Rimmer lamenting that “ I VBP we ’re just getting VBN to the politics of the absurd … it ’s been a JJ NN since politics was normal anywhere ” — and radical leftist British NN activist professor Stephan Lewandowsky fearfully telling his socialist comrades “ we have lost Australia for now ” . Not being noticed , understood or considered by these leftists , this report explains , is that Australia was neither “ lost ” to anyone nor were its citizens participating in “ the politics of the absurd ” — as all of them , in fact , are required under penalty of law ( A$ 20 fine for failure to vote ) to participate in their elections — and is a NN that requires voters to nominate multiple candidates which means that insurgent third - party campaigns have little purchase , because NNS can have their protest vote and still choose a mainstream candidate too — which is a preferential voting NN where minor - party votes VBP redistributed to the leading candidates in the NNP of Representatives elections , resulting in so - called “ CD - party preferred ” that should always sum to 100 % -- but whose stunning polling predictive failure was driven in part by the decline of landline telephones making pollsters ’ task in finding a representative sample of voters “ all but impossible ” — and is an issue that ’s occurring across the NN — thus causing polling organizations to benchmark against each other in a NN that ’s led to “ herding ” , that produces overconfidence IN what ’s turned out to be an utterly erroneous result . Most inexplicable , though , this report concludes , are why these socialist Western pollsters continue VBG the same failed predictive methods which catastrophically blew up in their faces when they tried and failed to predict the Brexit vote , failed to predict every single NN in the NN afterwards , and whose predictive failures now include Australia — CD of whose most expensive consequences of fell upon the Sportsbet bookies in Australia who made an early payout of $ 1.3 CD before yesterday ’s NN to those who bet on a socialist victory , because the polls VBD they MD n’t lose — an early payout , however , that collided with a “ miracle victory ” that was n’t supposed to happen causing these bookies to lose all of their NN — the humor of which they took in stride by hilariously posting “ this did n't age well ” — and was RB , beyond all doubt , relished by a NNP NNP who beat and smashed these socialist pollsters ’ predictions in CD — and is preparing to do so once again in 2020 .

""_''",""" NN NN and sustainability were not easy topics back then , "" remembers Hanno Franke , thinking back almost 25 NNS and almost sounding as if he ’s trying to defend himself . The SC Freiburg marketing director has been at the club since the mid-1990s , a NN when the Sport - Club from the Black Forest became the JJ Bundesliga club to begin taking measures to protect the environment . "" The club was n’t sure of its own identity , its own DNA , "" Franke explains . "" But RB then , the city of Freiburg took sustainability very seriously so it seemed logical that we as a football club should VB involved as well . JJ NNS advised us against it . Back then , some of our advisers warned us about being ' too green . ' "" CD of the main ideas was the installation of solar panels on the roof of the Schwarzwaldstadion ’s JJ south stand ( pictured above ) . It 's common measure by today 's standards , with JJ Bundesliga clubs producing their own solar NN , but in the mid-1990s , Freiburg were ahead of the curve and faced stiff opposition . "" Looking back , the club showed a great deal of courage and conviction and laid the groundwork for everything that followed , "" VBZ Franke , with barely concealable pride . Today , all Bundesliga clubs are aware of their JJ responsibilities , which can be divided into four main areas : traffic and NNS , waste , NN and NN . But it 's taken some clubs longer than others , with some only becoming "" greener "" when environmentally friendly measures RB allowed them to save NN . "" For a JJ NN , JJ protection did n't play a role in football at all , "" VBZ Thomas Fischer of the Deutsche Umwelthilfe ( DUH ) , a German JJ and consumer - protection agency that carries out regular surveys of Bundesliga clubs . "" But those days are over . "" However , Fischer still thinks more can be done . "" Clubs are great at implementing green policies when they do n't require any investment in infrastructure , such as VBG green NN or installing LED lights which save NN . "" In recent NNS , clubs have begun to expand their NN protection portfolios more or less off their own backs , or in cooperation with local businesses . In March 2019 , the 36 professional clubs in Germany ’s top three leagues came together to discuss JJ solutions , but there is still no central coordination through the German Football NNP ( DFL ) . "" The Bundesliga is still lacking a general NN plan , "" laments Fischer , who MD VB to VB clubs pool their activities for NN protection . "" The DFL needs to set JJ targets and provide instructions and guidelines to VB clubs implement concrete measures . "" No such guidelines currently exist and the DFL is yet to respond to questions sent by DW . In some areas , clubs are already implementing a number of measures to VB protect the environment . They reduce waste by separating materials and serving drinks in recyclable cups , they save NN by installing solar panels or VBG LED lighting and they save NN by gathering rain NN for pitch irrigation and providing NN - saving toilet facilities . But NNS created by travel to and from the matches remain a problem . According to a NN conducted by the NN advisory agency C02OL on behalf of German JJ broadcaster Deutschlandfunk , football fans produce RB 7,800 tons of harmful NNS per matchday . It MD take 60,000 newly planted trees to compensate for that amount of C02 , or over CD CD per season , and that 's before flights to further - flung away games are taken into consideration . In the north of Germany , Bundesliga side Werder Bremen are setting an example with an "" anti-automobile "" traffic concept . "" In Bremen , fans can travel to the stadium on a ferry along the River Weser , "" explains Fischer . "" What 's more , cars are banned from approaching the stadium or from parking there . "" This reduces the amount of C02 being released into the air IN the stadium . Fischer is still critical however of clubs such as Mainz and Hoffenheim who VBP themselves as being "" NN neutral . "" "" Ultimately , they achieve this by buying NN certificates , "" opines Fischer . “ It ’s not too far away from the selling of indulgences . "" In Hoffenheim 's defense , the club compensates for its C02 NNS by running a reforestation program in Uganda in central Africa . "" But that does n’t solve any waste or NNS problems in Hoffenheim itself , "" criticizes Fischer . Back in Freiburg , the local club is dealing with local problems . SC Freiburg cooperate with the NNP Wildlife Fund for Nature ( WWF ) on nature - protection projects in the Black Forest , the woodland which dominates the region . The project involves regularly educating local NNS and teenagers about NN NN and how they can live more environmentally friendly lives . Club employees are trained as well . RB when , after 25 NNS of experience , Freiburg are considered an "" industry leader "" in environmentally friendly football , there is still much to learn and the club remains open to JJ ideas . "" More and more organizations and campaigns are getting in touch with us because of our reputation which we have built up since the 1990s , "" VBZ Hanno Frenke , who is particularly pleased about the number of young NNS who approach the club with their own questions and feedback . "" We had the organizers of the Freiburg branch of ' Fridays for Future ' for a visit , for instance , "" he VBZ . "" And of course we supported them – out of conviction . """

The Arctic experienced NNS up to 70 degree F above normal . JJ NNS were baked in unusual heatwaves killing thousands . Incidents of droughts , extreme typhoons in the Pacific and hurricanes in the Atlantic , flash floods , and wildfires erupted daily in international NN headlines . As recent as 2014 , the NNP Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) , following an analysis of NNP satellite footage of NN dioxide movement IN the NN , concluded that our NN NN has entered “ unchartered territory at frightening speed . ” But 2017 was RB the NN when the statistical figures came in for CD . The WMO reported that CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere rose at record speed . Currently it is at its highest level in 800,000 NNS . If anyone held any doubt that NN NN is unreal , a fiction or fantasy , 2017 should have been wake up call to the most obstinate denialist . NNS have warned about our current days of NN for several decades . For those who jumped on the bandwagon NNS ago when atmospheric and geological NNS voiced serious concerns about JJ NN and its dire consequences , it was a NN with no huge surprises , except for the rapid acceleration of NN trends . It is NN that NNS , and more crucially our entire NN , to accept the fact that NN NN is the single most important threat to humanity ’s survival . Certainly , a nuclear confrontation with North Korea or NNP is a horrifying scenario that MD eliminate tens or RB hundreds of millions of NNS . However , it is within humanity ’s means to avoid nuclear NN . On the other hand it is highly improbable whether we can do much to deter NN NN . Natural forces are far beyond our technological NN - how and methods to VB powerful planetary forces regardless of how JJ efforts to advance geoengineering or a dramatic shift to renewable energies are made . Perhaps it will slow the pace of JJ NN a little , but it too has its own destructive blowback . The NNP ’s history is a JJ story of numerous NNS birthing , evolving and eventually VBG extinct . There is no manifest destiny for our NN . There is no divine promise that humanity MD not in the future follow in the footsteps of the dinosaurs . Our lives are not transcendent to Nature nor the multitude of other natural forces , animals , plants , microbes and other NN forms and molecules upon which our existence depends . This is a simple truth we must learn . And it must be learned quickly and without further delay . In a July issue of NNP NNP Magazine , journalist David Wallace - Wells published a worst NN , doomsday scenario of NN NN ’s impact upon JJ society and the environment before the end of this century . His essay , “ The Uninhabitable NNP , ” was VBN upon JJ private interviews with unnamed NNS who were willing to voice their deeper concerns about catastrophic events and eroding conditions humanity will face unless a concerted JJ response to reduce NN gases is not launched immediately . Aside from several of Wallace - Wells ’ factual errors , this was the JJ featured article to appear in a mainstream publication that focused on NN NN ’s darker side . It became the most read article in NNP NNP Magazine ‘s history . However , earlier in 2003 , Cambridge NNP astrophysicist and philosopher Martin Rees released his influential Our Final Hour warning that the pace of humanity ’s destructive activities presents a 50:50 chance for our civilization to survive past the end of the 21st century . Carcinogenic and unhealthy foods and high levels of deadly toxic chemicals in common everyday NNS are only minor risks compared to JJ other postmodern technologies impacting our lives . NN NN , combined with the genetic engineering of JJ viruses , synthetic biology , artificial intelligence , and rape of the NN for its last remaining natural resources , according to Rees , is a recipe for certain disaster and will likely end in the extinction of our NN . While JJ NNS and most of the general NN who acknowledge the facts about anthropogenic NN NN continue to hold enormous blind faith on JJ ingenuity and modern technology to prevent JJ NN ’s “ end game , ” Rees and a distinguished , multi- disciplinary consortium of NNS at the Cambridge Center for the NNP of Existential Risks acknowledge a darker side behind our over - reliance upon technological solutions –nuclear NN , geoengineering , genetic manipulation of nature , etc . Rees ’s 50:50 survival prediction was largely ignored after its publication over a decade ago . Nobody wants to accept that our survival is predicated upon a flip of a coin . Today , his predictions are being reevaluated and his supporters are increasing . And this is why Wallace - Wells ’ NNP NNP Magazine ‘s article is so important . There are more than ample reasons to fear the consequences of NN NN on our NN , food security , our livelihoods , well - being , and the survival of future generations , including our NNS . Extinction is forever , whether it be in a hundred , as the more pessimistic NNS suggest , or a thousand NNS or more . It is only a matter of NN before killer heat waves become the norm , chemical - VBN industrial agriculture collapses , national economies are devastated , JJ plagues and NN epidemics emerge , and NN and resource conflicts and wars increase . All of these have been previously predicted over the NNS , and each is already starting to cast its shadow over the NN . Fear combined with hope is a powerful motivating factor to embrace NN in personal habits and lifestyle . Therefore , it is critical today for humanity to become afraid , to become intensely afraid without becoming paralyzed . We condemn ourselves only by our failure to wake up while clinging to faux optimism , and by refusing to take upon ourselves the appropriate actions when confronted with an immediate emergency . NN NN NN poses certain obstacles difficult for the average person to accept . Perhaps most evident is that the NN and predictions appear too abstract . They can seem too foreign and impersonal . The calving of an enormous NN sheet in Antarctica or rapid Himalayan glacier melt do not set off alarm bells that threaten our cozy lives in JJ and European cities and suburbs . The events are too distant . We VBP that NN levels are rising . Everyone in Miami is aware of this fact because flooded areas in the city are now commonplace . The citizens of the Maldives and Solomon Islands certainly VBP this because their nations are already sinking under rising NN levels . But to imagine PRP ’s home or condominium along the coast being partially submerged permanently in the Atlantic Ocean is a NN too far off to VB about . Consequently , real estate developers continue their frenzy to build more residences up and down the Florida coast , and NNS continue to flock to the Sunshine NNP to purchase a sunny place to retire . It is almost obscene to imagine that four of the top ten cities witnessing the largest influx of migrants within the NNP NNPS are RB the most compromised by more immediate NN NN and extreme NN conditions : Houston ( No. 1 ) , Miami ( No. 2 ) , Phoenix ( No. 7 ) and Orlando ( No. CD ) . In August 2017 , Hurricane Harvey submerged over 100,000 homes throughout the greater Houston metropolitan area . While the storm itself cannot be attributed to humanity ’s contribution to JJ NN , the hurricane ’s intensity and NN is certainly related . Rising NN levels and warmer NN NN off the Texas coast — 7.2 degrees F above average making it the hottest spot of ocean NN in the NN — are the CD major factors that made Harvey so catastrophic and deadly . And similar extreme tropic storms are only VBG to increase as the NNP gets warmer . As the NN ’s NN heats further and NN levels rise , climatic events become increasingly more extreme . Consequently our lives become more stressed , miserable , insecure and uncertain . Individually , nobody can initiate the kind of grand massive NN in collective humanity ’s relationship to the environment being demanded today . However , each of us can make determined and immediate NNS in our personal lives and repair our personal rapport with the NN , nature , the ecology IN our homes , neighborhoods and towns . No honor is gained by sitting and waiting for NN to take concerted NN to lessen NN gas NNS and overhaul the federal regulatory NN to hold private industries and polluters accountable . The corruption of NNP is beyond reform because NN has itself become a private enterprise . Likewise , Americans are waking up to the realization that their votes are useless . Those who VBP to VB the most–elected officials and legislators , corporate CEOs and Chairmen , professional institutions – will not find the solutions until it is too late . In the meantime , they refuse to VB the problem . And this is clearly evident by the fact that the fossil fuel industry is expanding rather than receding . This chapter will lay out the fundamental problem humanity faces as NN NN and JJ NN accelerate . Although a popular awareness of NN NN is growing rapidly , most NNS still have difficulty connecting the dots between dramatic NN - related crises and calamities happening in far off regions of the NN and the impact these very same events have upon their personal lives . Therefore , I will be presenting the NN NN in simple lay language , providing crucial examples , in order to make JJ NN a more personal affair . Unless the threats the NNP faces are understood and perceived as a threat to our personal well - being and that of our immediate families , loved ones and friends , the constructive , necessary NN so direly needed will not unfold . Nevertheless , we must begin with ourselves because each of us possesses in her or his NN the capacity to live in harmony with NN and the greater whole of Nature . And then we must serve as an example of a conscientious , ecological lifestyle to those we meet . In August 2017 , the 900 - plus NN tanker Christophe de Margerie set sail from NNP ’s North NNP to South Korea . The cruise ’s novelty was that for the JJ NN in recorded history a sailing vessel crossed the Arctic ’s Northern NNP Route without the NN for icebreakers . The ship traveled freely , unencumbered across the broken , melting NN fields . This JJ incident regarding a tanker carrying natural gas half NN IN the NN MD seem incidental and insignificant , barely newsworthy . But for climatologists and Arctic ecologists it was an unexpected and disturbing event . It was another indication that the NN is racing faster towards an NN free Arctic . It was RB a warning that JJ NN is accelerating beyond expectations . Back in 2013 , the NNP of California was predicting that ships MD be incapable of traveling freely across the North Pole before 2050 . However , the Christophe ’s passage over the Arctic ’s southern frontier in under seven days holds a record . And this voyage MD have never been possible without the acceleration of anthropogenic NN NN . As the Russian vessel made its NN across the crown of the NN , at the opposite pole another surprising event occurred . On July 12 , 2017 , an iceberg , approximately 2,200 square NNS or roughly the size of the NN of Delaware , broke free from the Larsen C icesheet in Western Antarctica . This was the third gigantic Antarctic icesheet to collapse since 1995 , and the largest to date . Glaciologists were startled because the speed of the sheet ’s disintegration was miscalculated . Although the break , commonly VBN as “ calving , ” had been predicted several NNS prior , it was the suddenness that was disturbing . A week later , glaciologists ’ predictions were proven wrong a second NN . It had not been a clean split as calculated earlier . Instead , IN a stone hitting an auto ’s windshield , the break triggered a network of fissures indicating that the entire icesheet was quickly fragmenting and more sheets MD be calving in the near future . Antarctica is often viewed as the last place on NNP that will be touched by JJ NN due to JJ activity . However , CD observed a record low of NN NN , according to the NNP of NNP , and 2020 is now targeted as the turnaround point when the degradation of the southern polar icesheets will be directly the result of JJ activity . Already , atmospheric NNS in the Antarctic have been rising annually by 4 - 6 C . As NN seasons lengthen , NN sheets melt and calf faster and eventually the shelves thin further and disappear . For the twenty - JJ century , these CD geological events , and JJ others , are indicative of the greatest threat to humanity : JJ NN and NN NN . For the JJ NN in JJ history , our NN has entered an era of extraordinary and anxious uncertainty . JJ are bewildered when they hear about the loss of an Antarctic NN sheet , prolonged droughts , NNS reaching above 50 degree Celsius , flash floods , and uncontrollable wildfires . What does it mean when we hear that CD was the third NN in a row to set a JJ record for average JJ NNS ? Is this simply a fluke ? An aberration in the usual NN patterns we have become accustomed to ? Will it continue or end ? The international scientific community is nearly unanimous in confirming that JJ NN is accelerating and JJ activity is its primary driving force . There is RB near unanimous certainty the course we are following to reach catastrophic benchmarks is inevitable and completely outside our civilization ’s NN . Those NNS who resist the international consensus are far and few between . The majority of dissenters lack a professional background in the NNP and NN sciences , climatology , glaciology and other disciplines directly associated with measuring and observing NNS in the atmosphere and the NNP ’s geology . For several decades , NNS the NN over have been running simulated NN models repeatedly to determine whether increased NN is anthropogenic or caused by JJ activity . And repeatedly whenever JJ - generated NN gases –CO2 , methane , nitrous oxide , NN vapor , dust , etc. – are removed from their equations , they are unable to account for the sudden rise in the NNP ’s NN as the result of natural phenomena alone . Already the NNP is warmer than it has been for the last 120,000 NNS . However , when these same models introduce NN gases into their equations , they accurately correlate with the actual NN trends being witnessed . JJ - term , 90 % of planetary NN is linked to the actions of our NN . The remaining CD % , according to Konrad Steffen , director of the Swiss Polar Institute , is “ unexplained . It is not uncommon for climatologists to underestimate the swiftness of NN - related events . The statistical and computational models to portend timelines for certain NN tipping points , although highly sophisticated , are unable to account for all variables and trends , particularly unforeseeable catastrophes such as mammoth biomass NNS from wildfires and other natural and JJ calamities . For example , researchers MD not predictable calculate the explosion of BP ’s Deep Horizon facility that discharged up to 520,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere , the equivalent of burning upwards to 3.1 CD barrels of crude oil . Consequently dire findings are either VBN wanting or too sober as JJ observations upgrade earlier forecasts . Very soon the Arctic region will be NN free throughout the NN . Conservatively the Arctic will lose all its NN during the warmest months before 2030 . We still do n’t VB precisely JJ of the JJ - term consequences to the polar region and the NN ’s biosystems once this tipping point is reached . However , there are approximately four CD NNS living along the Arctic Circle , including hundreds of thousands of indigenous NNS . Very likely , most of the coastal communities will be forced to migrate in the near future as shorelines dependent upon NN , freezing NNS and colder seasons start to crumble and disappear . Acceleration is RB exasperated by the thawing permafrost and tundra , and the massive release of methane and nitrous oxide , in the Arctic North . In point of fact , the polar North is collapsing . The loss of the Arctic ’s albedo , the white NN of NN that reflects the NNP ’s radiation back into NN , has already passed its tipping point . For as RB as NNS have been on the third NN from the NNP , we will never return to a NN when polar bears and seals thrived on frozen ocean surfaces . We can no longer prevent the Western Antarctic icesheets , including the Larsen and Ross sheets , from slipping away into the dark oceanic waters . The rush of fresh NN from melting glaciers in Greenland are beyond our technological means to prevent the disruption in the Atlantic Ocean ’s conveyor belt . VBN upon satellite NN feeds , the Greenland sheets , according to David Barber at the NNP of Manitoba , are now melting six hundred times faster than the current modeling trends suggest . Similarly , due to JJ complex and unknown factors , it is exceedingly difficult to ascertain exactly how high the oceans will rise if all Antarctic NN melts . For example , CD of the largest Antarctic icesheets rests on solid ground below NN level . On the CD hand , this makes the sheet far more unstable and geologists continue to try to determine its JJ impact following its last breath . Nevertheless the loss of the Ross icesheet in West Antarctica alone MD raise NN levels CD - 13 NNS ( 3 - 4 meters ) . In 2014 , NNP ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the NNP of California at Irvine determined that the loss of the West Antarctic sheet is unstoppable . The circulation of the ocean ’s warmer waters beneath the NN continues to thin and melt the shelf . No technology nor RB a drastic reduction in NN gas NNS can prevent it . As if a warhead missile had already been launched , we can only sit and wait to experience the consequences befalling us upon impact . For JJ NNS , NNS were not terribly concerned about a rapid melt of Antarctic icesheets . The southern pole has always been thought to be the last place on NN to experience JJ NN . For the past 40 NNS , winter NN has actually increased –until recently . In CD , NNP of NNP researchers noted a perfect storm of conditions that , if repeated annually , will increase Antarctic NN melts and possibly trend towards declining NN buildup during the winter months . CD of the causes the NN NNS identified was a NN in El Nino patterns that are now reaching the Antarctic . In NNP 2014 , NNP Central provided a probable scenario of JJ land lost due to a CD NN increase in NN levels . Approximately 28,800 square NNS of land mass MD disappear with rising waters and force the dislocation of over 12 CD NNS , primarily along the US eastern seaboard . Twenty - seven cities in Florida MD be the most seriously affected . The report determined that the cost of lost property MD be upwards to $ 950 billion–a very conservative figure . The majority of the loss MD be in the southern NNS but RB a third in NNP NNP and NNP Jersey . The complete loss of 5 CD cubic NNS of NN now blanketing the NNP , including JJ mountain glaciers , MD raise NN levels by 216 NNS . San Francisco Bay Area MD be a cluster of JJ islands . Along with Los Angeles and San Diego , the NNP East Coast MD vanish . Bye bye London , Venice , Netherlands and most of Denmark . From Bangladesh across Southeast Asia to the Cardamom Mountains in Cambodia , only JJ islets MD remain . Mt Fuji MD remain as a standing volcano bulging monolithically out of the Pacific . Four out of five Australians MD be displaced and vast regions of Africa MD be uninhabitable . NNS are hopeful that a complete NN free NN is over a thousand NNS down the stretch . But without doubt humanity has entered uncharted territory on the geological map . Our technological tools and modeling systems , albeit highly sophisticated , are still incapable of the daunting task to establish precise timelines . Unpredictable events and catastrophes affecting feedback loops , such as wildfires , volcanic eruptions , oil fires or industrial plant explosions — such as the Arkema chemical plant explosion near Houston after Hurricane Harvey — and the numerical increase in extreme NN events cannot be accurately calculated into NN gas simulations . Harvey ’s rainfall is estimated to have been the worst in US history and the most devastating storm to hit Houston . Nineteen trillion gallons of NN . For five days , the “ capitol ” of NNP ’s fossil fuel industry was flooded with torrential rains and wave surges , shutting down and damaging oil refineries and chemical plants along Texas ’ eastern coast . Over CD CD pounds of toxic pollutants and NN gases were released . Such events fall outside the realm of computerized simulations and cannot be accurately included in predictive NN models . For this reason , scientific conclusions are often far more conservative than the actual NN of the NN . Therefore we must start to realize that there is no precedent on the NNP ’s 4.6 CD NN geological timeline to serve as a reliable baseline to accurately calculate NN - related events in the Anthropocene Age ."

( AP Photo / Evan Vucci ) NNP Donald NNP listens during a conference call with banks on efforts to VB JJ businesses during the NN NN , at the White NNP , Tuesday , April 7 , 2020 , in NNP . ( AP Photo / Evan Vucci ) NNP ( AP ) — Despite mocking the idea of NN NN , NNP Donald NNP will preside over CD of the country ’s sharpest drops in NN - damaging NNS on record , as the JJ paralysis from the NN tamps down NN use , according to an NNP Department projection on Tuesday . The agency ’s NNP NNP Administration projects a 7.5 % drop in fossil fuel NNS for 2020 . That MD be the biggest cut in U.S. NN NNS since at least 1990 , EIA records show . The NN after the start of the 2008 recession saw a 7.3 % decline . NNP routinely mocks the NN of NN NN , and his administration has moved to roll back tougher mileage and NNS standards and other NN efforts from the Obama administration . NNS will fall markedly this NN anyway , owing to the slowing economy and restrictions on business and travel related to the NN , the EIA VBD . Burning of fossil fuels , and the rate of NN damage , typically rebounds as an economy does , after JJ downturns . Globally , “ we ’re seeing radical declines in transportation NNS and drops in other sectors of the economy , ” VBD Stanford NNP ’s Rob Jackson , who heads a group of independent NNS who monitor JJ NN pollution . “ We have n’t seen anything IN this since the Great Depression . ” The NN agency projects Americans will burn 9 % less gasoline and diesel and CD % less jet fuel , and that the electricity sector will generate 3 % less NN overall , among other declines . Solar and wind NN — which VBP scant attention from NNP , other than his statements of loathing for wind turbines — will account for the majority of the country ’s JJ electricity generation , the report VBZ . As marketplace competition reshapes how Americans VBP their NN , NN plants will use 11 % more renewables and 20 % less coal this NN . The 2020 outlook RB marks a setback in NNP ’s frequently stated mission of helping make the NNP NNPS the NN ’s dominant player in NN production . The NN and an unrelated petroleum supply glut caused by ramped - up pumping by Saudi Arabia and NNP will return the NNP NNPS to being a net importer of petroleum for at least a NN , as domestic drilling subsides , the EIA report VBD . Any JJ accord to cut back oil production MD VB that , the agency noted . “ These trends are only temporary and they ’ll VB away as fast as this NN NN goes away , ” VBD NN scientist Jonathan Overpeck , the NNP of Michigan ’s environment dean . The story has been corrected to reflect that the NNP of Michigan ’s environment dean , not an NNP Department spokeswoman , VBD a drop in NN - changing NNS during the NN outbreak MD be temporary ."

The aim of the conference is to support and showcase Nationally Determined Contributions ( NDCs ) to the Paris Agreement which are ambitious , VBN on the principles of justice and equity , and promote and protect NN . It will RB mobilize the rapidly growing movement of NN professionals IN the NN who are now driving ambitious NN NN . The conference will be organized by the NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) and by the NNP NNP and NNP Alliance ( GCHA ) , in close collaboration with Glasgow Caledonian NNP and its Centre for NNP Justice , with the UK NNP Alliance on NNP NNP , and other partners . The NN 2020 will VB the Paris Agreement come to NN . At its heart , the Paris Agreement is about caring for NNS and protecting them from an uncertain and increasingly unsafe future . Everyone has the NN to a healthy environment , free of pollution and its harmful consequences . Over 100 governments have already indicated they will update their national NN plans to the Paris Agreement ( VBN as Nationally Determined Contributions , NDCs ) , and these enhanced NN plans aim to include all vital sectors , including the NN sector . The same JJ activities that are destabilizing the NNP ’s NN RB contribute directly to poor NN . For example , the main driver of NN NN , fossil fuel combustion , RB contributes about 2/3 of JJ exposure to outdoor air pollution , which causes over 4 CD deaths a NN . Including indoor air pollution brings the total to over 7 CD deaths worldwide every NN – about 1 in every 8 deaths . The overall cost to JJ wellbeing , and to economies , is enormous . Air pollution alone costs an estimated US $ 5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally each NN . In the 15 NNS with the highest NN gas NNS , the NN impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4 % of their GDP . JJ concern over the NN impacts of air pollution is an increasing driver of JJ movements for NN on NN NN and overall JJ protection . Meeting the Paris goals MD result in NN gains which are twice as JJ as the costs of the mitigation measures from improved air quality alone . The NN gains of NN NN VBP well beyond air quality . They range from more sustainable diets and food systems addressing the rising burden of NN associated with overweight and obesity , to urban transport systems that facilitate walking and cycling , and bringing NN gains from increased physical activity . Weighing in both the impacts of NN - damaging business - as - usual policies and the massive NN co-benefits of ambitious NN policy , drives NN policies that are more ambitious and NN - promoting . The NNP Conference on NNP & NNP NNP will bring together a range of key actors in JJ NN and NN NN policy in order to incorporate JJ NN and NN justice considerations in the UN NN negotiations . It will highlight the initiatives , policies and cross-sectoral collaborations that are driving ambitious and healthy Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement in the lead - up to COP26 . The conference will be organized by the NNP NNP Organization - convening its 4th NNP Conference on NNP and NNP - and by the NNP NNP and NNP Alliance - convening its 8th NNP NNP and NNP Summit - in close collaboration with the Glasgow Caledonian NNP and its Centre for NNP Justice , the UK NNP Alliance on NNP NNP and other partners . The overarching theme of the Conference will be Healthy and Ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement , and will include sessions on the NN co-benefits of a broad range of NN policies , including clean NN policies ; air quality measures ; subsidy reform ; smart agriculture and sustainable food systems ; educational and civil society involvement ; nature - VBN solutions and others . A series of WHO - led initiatives , NN - studies and workshops throughout 2020 will feed into the outcomes of the JJ NN & NN conference and the COP26 UN NN conference . • Publication : NN in the NDCs - a WHO Review"

This buildup , which is a reaction to foods , allergens or acid reflux , can inflame or injure the esophageal tissue . Damaged esophageal tissue can lead to difficulty swallowing or VB food to VB stuck when you swallow . Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic JJ NN NN . It has been identified only in the past CD decades , but is now considered a major NN of digestive NN ( gastrointestinal ) illness . Research is ongoing and will likely lead to revisions in the diagnosis and treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis . • Food getting stuck in the esophagus after swallowing ( impaction ) • Chest NN that is often centrally located and does not respond to antacids • Food getting stuck in the esophagus after swallowing ( impaction ) When to VB a NN Seek immediate JJ attention if you experience chest NN , especially if you RB have shortness of breath or jaw or arm NN . These MD be NNS of a heart attack . Make an appointment with your NN if you experience severe or frequent eosinophilic esophagitis NNS . If you take over - the - counter medications for heartburn more than twice a week , VB your NN . Eosinophils are a normal type of white NN cells present in your digestive tract . However , in eosinophilic esophagitis , you have an allergic reaction to an outside substance . The reaction MD occur as follows : • Reaction of the esophagus . The lining of your esophagus reacts to allergens , such as food or pollen . • Multiplication of eosinophils . The eosinophils multiply in your esophagus and produce a NN that causes inflammation . • Damage to esophagus . Inflammation can lead to scarring , narrowing and formation of excessive fibrous tissue in the lining of your esophagus . • Dysphagia and impaction . You MD have difficulty swallowing ( dysphagia ) or have food become stuck when you swallow ( impaction ) . • Additional NNS . You MD have other NNS , such as chest NN or stomach NN . There has been a significant increase in numbers of NNS diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in the past decade . At RB , researchers thought this was due to an increase in awareness among doctors and greater availability of tests . However , studies now suggest the NN is becoming increasingly common , parallel to the increase in asthma and allergy . The following NN factors are associated with eosinophilic esophagitis : • NN . NNS who live in a cold or dry NN are more likely than those in other climates to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis . • Season . You 're more likely to be diagnosed between the spring and fall , probably because levels of pollen and other allergens are higher and NNS are more prone to be outdoors . • Sex . Eosinophilic esophagitis is more common in males than in females . • Family history . Doctors VBP eosinophilic esophagitis MD run in the family ( have a genetic component ) . If your family members have eosinophilic esophagitis , you have a greater chance of being diagnosed . • Allergies and asthma . If you have food or JJ allergies , asthma , atopic dermatitis or a chronic respiratory NN , you 're more likely to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis . • Age . Originally , eosinophilic esophagitis was thought to be a childhood NN , but now it is VBN to be common in adults as well . The NNS differ somewhat between NNS and adults . In some NNS , eosinophilic esophagitis can lead to the following : • Scarring and narrowing of the esophagus . This makes it difficult to swallow and more likely that you will have food VB stuck . • Damage to the esophagus . Because of inflammation of the esophagus , endoscopy can VB perforation or tears in the tissue that lines the esophagus . Tearing can RB occur in connection with retching that some NNS experience when they VBP food stuck in the esophagus ."

Some Christians are calling this the beginning of the Tribulation . ” Top Picks on July 5 , 2015 at 11:07 am · No Comments “ Yet it must RB be recognized that nuclear NN , biotechnology , NN technology ; NN of our DNA , and JJ other abilities , which we have acquired , have …given those with the NN , and especially the JJ resources to use them , an impressive dominance over the whole of humanity and the entire NN … . In whose hands does all this NN lie , or will it eventually end up ? It is risky for a JJ part of humanity to have it . ” ( p.77 ) ~ Pope Francis A Papal Encyclical is a letter concerning Catholic doctrine which is circulated by the Pope . This week , Pope Francis published a JJ Encyclical : Laudato Si ’ of the Holy Father Francis – Care for Our Common Home . The 180 + page document sounds the alarm regarding the JJ degradation of living things : NNS , animals and our environment . If this document had been authored by a professor of theology , there MD be much room for common ground . However , it has been written by the leader of an institution which has been the single most powerful in the Western NN for the last 500 NNS – a period during which the central banking - warfare model has been busy harvesting our common home . There is a profound disassociation from the nuts - and - bolts of what the Catholic Church ( and its networks and investment syndicates ) have been doing and the sources of their wealth . This Encyclical is , if you will , a concept piece independent of the financial and JJ realities of the Vatican , the Catholic Church and its allies . Assuming that Pope Francis RB and foremost addressed the Encyclical to bishops , patriarchs , primates , archbishops as well as to the general population , I MD VB to propose several steps which the Pope , the Vatican and the leadership of the Catholic Church ( collectively , the “ Church ” ) might take to integrate some of the best ideas in this document into the NN lines controlled and influenced by the Church . The NN is struggling with propaganda , disinformation , and significant suppression of the truth . The JJ Pope ’s efforts to provide digital access to works in the Vatican Library on a selective basis are a good start . In the meantime , there is a great deal of NN which the Church , its libraries and networks can share : • The Church can accelerate access to both the Vatican Library and Archives . • The Church can publish all its NN regarding JJ “ black budgets . ” This MD include any NN related to invisible weaponry and technology driving the real governance systems operating on NNP NNP . • In the context of understanding what is happening to our environment , the Church can publish all its NN on JJ geo-engineering and NN NN programs as part of an open discussion to ensure that the JJ population and scientific community has accurate NNS on what is happening to our NN . • The Church can provide open access to its financial NN and persuade its affiliates , endowments and churches to do the same , including detailed disclosure on a place - VBN basis . • The Church can encourage JJ governments to publish their budgets and credit NN on a place - VBN basis . Place - VBN financial disclosure will permit the alignment of financial ecosystems with JJ ecosystems – a critical step to ensuring a healthy environment . This will create incentive systems which reward the NN and well - being of all living things . • The Church can disclose all NN on its direct and indirect involvement in any illegal activities , including vote rigging , narcotics trafficking , and NN laundering . • The Church can use its shareholdings and ownership positions in NN NNS to insist on integrity in JJ NN . • The Church can use its shareholdings in pharmaceutical and food NNS to insist on integrity and independence of scientific research . • The Church can provide a safe haven for NNS , journalists and other professionals who are targeted for upholding high standards of integrity in NN and NN . Slavery contributes significantly to the degradation of NNS throughout our NN . • The Church can withdraw from supporting governments , corporations or any other organizations that support any form of slavery . • The Church can destroy the “ NN files ” of prominent businessmen and politicians created through the use of its networks . • The Church can complete restoration efforts related to its pedophilia activities and publish complete figures on how much the Church has spent on all restoration efforts . • The Church can use its shareholdings and ownership positions in NN and corporate securities to insist on a withdrawal of corporate and NN support for NN NN , torture and slavery and the compromise of individual privacy and sovereignty . The primary source of JJ damage does not result from NN economics – quite the opposite . It results from the lethal combination of organized crime operating powerful and invisible weaponry coupled with invasive digital systems and sophisticated financial tools on scale . In short , those with the ability to kill , to destroy and to steal with impunity combine such force with fiat currencies , unsustainable debt , resource extraction , financial fraud , NN and genocide in order to centralize wealth and NN in a manner which shrinks total wealth . Lawlessness on a JJ scale must be dealt with before it destroys our NN . • The Church can divest its holdings in governments and corporations which engage in these practices . It should encourage its affiliates and members to do the same . • The Church can RB disassociate from foundations and not - for - profits that engage in these practices or that launder profits for those who do . • The Church can make clear that the ten commandments apply not just to what we do , but to whom and what we finance . • The Church can stop any and all participation by itself and its networks in narcotics trafficking and disgorge the profits of the same to the NNS harmed . No less than The Economist has rightly pointed out that we are chocking on debt , in part because we provide enormous tax subsidies which encourage debt ( VB The Great Distortion ) . Debt throws NNS out of alignment with CD another and with the environment IN them . Ditto fiat currency which is VBN in a manner to debase JJ populations and economies . We must shift to an equity - VBN financial NN which facilitates the free flow of equity unencumbered by the intervention and NN of organized crime . An equity - VBN NN – which includes the financing of JJ businesses , JJ farms and local economies with equity – will permit us to evolve a financial NN in which we can generate wealth from healing our environment and reducing consumption . • The Church can encourage these NNS by shifting the significant funds it manages as well as those managed by its networks . • The Church can encourage governments to reduce laws and regulations that prevent the local circulation of equity or that prevent the creation and success of local currency systems . A JJ culture is CD which respects the sovereignty of every individual . We respect JJ rights . We respect property rights . We respect privacy . We respect the NN of each JJ being to make up their own NN . • The Church can withdraw its investments from all governments and corporations ( including NN ) which compromise NNS ’s privacy or which manipulate them via NN NN techniques , entrainment technology , subliminal programming or electronics . • The Church can actively encourage its priests and networks to bring transparency to NN NN techniques or any efforts to mislead NNS globally . • The Church can offer sanctuary to NNS , NN personnel or journalists who bring transparency to these efforts . Before we dismiss capitalism , we should try it . Organized crime is not capitalism . It is the application of force to VB and to VB PRP ’s NN . NN economics can solve JJ of the problems before us – but we have to unleash markets to work rather than prevent them from operating and then blaming the subsequent “ mess ” on them . • The Church can call for all monies stolen by illegal means in the last CD decades to be returned , including trillions which have disappeared from the US NN or which have been accrued as a result of financial frauds prior to the bailouts . • The Church can refrain from blaming our current situation on the NNS who have been harmed by these thefts or from insisting that the subsequent JJ damage is a result of the victims ’ poor values or “ consumerism . ” • The Church can withdraw its investment from financial institutions , governments and corporations that : • Provide unlawful or unethical support to cartels and monopolies . • Engage in the purposeful suppression of technologies which MD ease the harm we are doing to the environment . The Church and its affiliates and members manage trillions in real estate and financial assets . As CD of the most significant capitalist organizations / investment networks on our NN , it can institute policies to ensure that it does not invest in NNS or governments which behave in the manner described in the latest Encyclical and that its real estate is not VBN to support such activities . During Vatican II , the Church forced the sale of significant real estate holdings which were serving communities . The proceeds from these NNS were reinvested in corporate securities . The Church can ensure that the Orders for whom these funds are managed have access to full transparency about these investments and are permitted to institute policies which ensure that these investments are managed in accordance with the goals of this Encyclical . Published JJ JJ expenditures were $ 1.7 trillion in 2013 . Add secret black budget expenditures and the total was likely much more . These funds – combined with savings from destructive behavior such as gambling , narcotics and alcohol – MD be shifted into investment in healing our environment , our education systems , our NN care systems and revitalizing JJ infrastructure . • The Church can bring transparency to all worldwide resources which are related to killing . It can invite its members to pray that these resources be shifted to investments which increase productivity rather than enable a JJ group of NNS to own and VB the NN . Both the Church and our NN are dynamic living systems . Moving to a healthy JJ culture and aligning our financial ecosystems with our JJ ecosystems is a journey . • The Church can encourage its entire network to adopt these goals in their lives so that achieving them is a partnership of the JJ for the benefit of all . • The Church can publish an annual report on its efforts to take responsibility and to achieve these goals internally in its own operations , asset managements and investments and to invite feedback from all of its constituents to VB it do so . There is often a NN that any important policy will be misunderstood or misused by those who are centralizing NN and NN . The G - 7 nations have experienced a financial coup d’etat . A great deal of NN and assets have been shifted out of sovereign governments into private hands – either illegally or under the guise of trillions in bailouts and quantitative easing – while liabilities have been shifted back into governments . Now that these transfers are complete , it MD be convenient to blame the victims and to abrogate their pensions and other savings plans and promises . It MD be unfortunate if this Encyclical were VBN to justify the value of doing so in the name of “ reducing consumerism ” or to politically outmaneuver the victims by accusing them of being “ selfish . ” Economies function on trust and such trust must come from honoring our agreements . As Pope Francis understands , it is easy to blame the victim and to take from the powerless . Utah Phillips once VBD , “ The NNP is not dying , it is being killed . And the NNS doing the killing have names and addresses . ” We commend the Pope for calling out for a cessation of the debasement of all living things . Let us hope that his latest Encyclical starts ringing doorbells – beginning with the opportunity to do so in the Church and in the Church ’s asset and investment portfolios ."

"" Structural racism is deeply embedded in all areas of society , and JJ education is no exception , "" according to the NN in the August issue of Academic Medicine . To examine the effect of racism in JJ school , researchers surveyed students at 49 unidentified U.S. JJ schools in their JJ semester and again in their final semester . "" This NN provides NN that racism manifested at multiple levels in JJ schools was associated with graduating students ' decisions to provide care in high - NN communities , "" the article concludes . "" Strategies to identify and eliminate structural racism , and its manifestations in JJ school are needed . "" The publication is the latest of more than 30 articles to present findings from the NNP Student Cognitive Habits and Growth Evaluation NNP ( NNP ) , the JJ longitudinal survey NN of the effects of JJ education on students ' biases and attitudes over NN . The national NN is being conducted by Oregon NNP & NNP NNP in collaboration with Mayo Clinic 's Research Group on Equity and Inclusion in NNP Care , Yale NNP and the NNP of Minnesota . To limit the scope , the NN focused on attitudes toward African Americans , although NNS explored attitudes about other groups , as well , explains JJ author Sean Phelan , Ph.D. , a Mayo Clinic NN sciences researcher . "" I hope the NN will spark NN , "" Dr. Phelan VBZ . "" I MD VB to VB more conversation about diversity and inclusion in curriculum and the NN to make NNS in JJ training to minimize racism and bias . "" The multidisciplinary team hypothesized that three factors might reflect bias in JJ education , and the results indicate that all three predicted whether students changed their minds on wanting to work in an underserved area or in a primarily minority community : • School curricula and policies can create an unintended , structural type of racism if they lack or do n't require NN on cultural awareness , racial disparities and bias , or provide experience with service learning . "" We suggest that , within JJ education , the types of courses that JJ schools require and the NN that they prioritize for training JJ physicians can critically shape students ' interest in practicing in underserved areas , "" Dr. Phelan VBZ . • School culture and NN , including behaviors exhibited by faculty and attending physicians , represent a hidden curriculum on acceptable or normal ways to interact . • Individual student attitudes and behaviors tended to VB over four NNS of JJ school . Students ' negative racial attitudes at matriculation were associated with decreased intention to practice with underserved or minority populations at graduation , while students who had more interactions with black students , faculty and allied NN staff , and considered those interactions favorable , were more likely to choose to practice in a black community . The team VBD that racism at the structural or cultural level MD reinforce a belief in JJ hierarchy and dissuade students from a career focused on caring for those perceived to be lower in that hierarchy . However , among students who initially intended to work with minority populations , those who witnessed examples of discrimination in JJ school were more likely to stay committed to that path . • Service learning experiences and a curriculum focused on improving minority NN were associated with increased intention to practice in underserved communities . • A curriculum focused on minority NN and disparities , students ' perceived skill at developing relationships with minority patients , a higher proportion of minority students at the school , and awareness of interracial tension in the JJ school environment were associated with increased intention to care for minority patients . "" We 've been following this cohort for a JJ NN to understand how their experiences in JJ education influence the predictors of potentially biased care , "" VBZ Michelle van Ryn , Ph.D. , the principal investigator . Dr. Van Ryn is the distinguished professor at Oregon NNP & NNP NNP 's School of Nursing and JJ director of Mayo Clinic 's Research Program on Equity and Inclusion in NNP Care . "" These findings suggest that JJ education leaders can take NN to affect students ' decisions to work with underserved populations . "" NNS began nearly CD NNS ago . Additional surveys were conducted in the second and fourth NNS of residency . The final survey will be administered five NNS after JJ school . To avoid influencing responses , the team delayed publication of findings until after students graduated from JJ school .

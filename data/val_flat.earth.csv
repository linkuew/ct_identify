903,"PEACE in the Middle East, according to Tami Leibovitz, may depend on Israelis learning good manners. She runs a charm school near Tel Aviv, and has a clientele of aspiring politicians, Foreign Ministry officials and former army officers, all seeking to unlearn traditional Israeli behaviour - aggressive, loud and rude.

If you think I'm being offensive, this is what she told an American audience: ""Israelis will cut in on your conversation and will often interrupt in the middle of a sentence. It is also quite common for an Israeli to complete your sentence for you. Israelis talk very loudly.""

Mrs Leibovitz, who spends her time trying to convince Israelis that being polite does not necessarily make one a weakling or a dupe, told the Guardian that the Middle East could be saved by good manners: ""We have to see that even Palestinians are human beings ... We don't know yet how to speak to other people and how to solve problems together. We have to learn that.""

Judging by the reaction of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, when he was invited to Norway to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Oslo accords this week, peace remains some way off and Mrs Leibovitz still has work to do. Netanyahu, said his spokesman, was too busy. Besides, ""there are more important things ...""

Someone yet to be selected would be sent, the spokesman went on, before adding: ""I don't think the competition for that is too fierce."" Rude or what?

RECENTLY we learned that the true love of Simone de Beauvoir's life was the American writer Nelson Algren, with whom she carried on despite her decades-long relationship with her fellow Existentialist, Jean-Paul Sartre. He knew about Algren, apparently, and did not like the affair. But he had to put up with it, since he demanded the freedom to have amours of his own.

Reading the transatlantic correspondence reminded me of a story told by my late aunt, who lived in Paris for many years and one day found herself sitting at the next table to Sartre and de Beauvoir in a cafe.

Thrilled, my aunt leant closer to hear what two of the greatest minds in France were talking about. The subjects under discussion, it turned out, were their investments and their haemorrhoids.

NOW I know the Asian economic crisis is serious. What brought this home was the news that women in Bangkok's sex industry are asking to be retrained in some other line of work.

Thailand's education ministry says it is setting up vocational courses after being approached by several ""dancers"" - for which read prostitutes - from Patpong, Bangkok's infamous red-light district. Some have asked to be taught traditional Thai massage, an eminently more respectable branch of the trade than that practised in Patpong. What this key economic indicator seems to show is that, despite the cheapness of international flights to Thailand, the sex trade cannot manage without local custom. Rather different from what some campaigners would have us believe.",mainstream,M151b8,flat.earth
921,"Albert Einstein stood common sense on its head when he proclaimed time to be just another dimension, like height, width and depth, and went on to declare that it can be stretched and warped like taffy. But that notion is much too mundane for Julian Barbour. According to the 64-year-old British physicist, there's no point in trying to describe time, because it simply doesn't exist. ""The passage of time,"" he says, ""is simply an illusion created by our brains.""

This unconventional theory comes from an equally unconventional man. After completing his doctorate in physics in 1968, Barbour balked at working in a university, where he would have had to teach, worry about raising grant money and persuade deans to give him tenure. Instead he started earning money by translating Russian articles into English--and did theoretical physics on the side.

The riddle of time had fascinated him all along, and about 15 years ago he tackled it in earnest. Recalls Barbour: ""I asked myself, 'How do you get hold of time? It's invisible; you can't really get your hands on it. So what is it really?'"" There wasn't any good answer. Although physicists work with time all the time (as it were), they never define precisely what it is. Barbour also knew that at least one physicist, an American named Bryce DeWitt, had managed to meld general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single consistent theory--a major goal of modern physics--by removing time from the equations. But that was generally considered a mathematical trick with no basis in reality.

Barbour thought otherwise. Every ""moment"" we experience is real, he says, but these moments exist only for that brief instant, during which time literally stands still. The passage of time is as illusory as the sense of movement created by the succession of still frames in a motion picture.

Most scientists are wary of abandoning time, but Barbour's idea is taken quite seriously by such respected physicists as Penn State's Lee Smolin and the University of Alberta's Don Page. There may even be a way to test it experimentally; a consequence of Barbour's theory is that the universe would be filled with more black holes and neutron stars than experts believe. If so, we could know within a decade whether his theory is supported by astronomical observations--and whether the ideas of time we've clung to for most of human history will go the way of the ether and the flat earth.",mainstream,M097eb,flat.earth

New York Times, Breathing Tubes Fail to Save Many Older Patients by Paula Span — A tightfitting mask over the nose and mouth helps patients with certain conditions breathe nearly as well as intubation does. But they remain conscious and can have the mask removed briefly for a sip of water or a short conversation.

Scientific American, The Healthy Addiction? Coffee Study Finds More Health Benefits by David Noonan — …Tea drinkers might wonder if they are missing out on a potential health benefit and should start drinking the other stuff. “Absolutely not,” says Donald Hensrud, medical director of Mayo Clinic's Healthy Living Program. “You have to enjoy life, and if you enjoy tea, keep on enjoying it. It’s all good. There are health benefits to coffee, to black tea and to green tea.” But there can also be problems associated with higher doses of caffeine, he notes. The amount in more than two cups of coffee a day, for example, can interfere with conception and increase the risk of miscarriage. And, he says, because individuals metabolize caffeine at different rates, slow metabolizers may be more susceptible to side effects such as heartburn, insomnia, heart palpitations and irritability.

538,"Good Morning Britain viewers were in disbelief as a debate about the shape of the Earth was aired.

Mark Sargent was adamant the Earth is flat, claiming ""NASA has been keeping a state secret"" all this time.

The conspiracy theorist explained his reasoning to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: ""All you need to do is get a big HD camera and take it on to a beach.

""Point it out to sea and zoom in and you'll see it doesn't drop.

""All the world's a stage, and we're just in a big soundstage.""

Mark continued: ""The first blue marble shot of the earth was taken by Apollo 17 in 1972, and the second one was two summers ago.

""We had three decades with no blue marble shots. Why?

""If this place was built, it was built by someone, so we're not alone.""

Piers, in disbelief, said: ""So you think a bunch of aliens built the Earth and pretend it's round?""

He then turned to Terry Virts, an astronaut who spent 200 days on the International Space Station in 2015, and asked him how he could prove the Earth was round.

He simply showed a picture of the round Earth from his book - although Mark claimed the pictures were ""doctored"".

192,"Writer John Steinbeck was presented the U.S. Medal of Freedom on September 14, 1964. Steinbeck had already received numerous other honors and awards for his writing, including the 1962 Nobel Prize and a 1939 Pulitzer Prize for Grapes of Wrath.

Steinbeck, a native Californian, studied writing intermittently at Stanford between 1920 and 1925 but never graduated. He moved to New York and worked as a manual laborer and journalist while writing his first two novels, which were not successful. He married in 1930 and moved back to California with his wife. His father, a government official in Salinas County, gave the couple a house to live in while Steinbeck continued writing.

His first novel, Tortilla Flat, about the comic antics of several rootless drifters who share a house in California, was published in 1935. The novel became a financial success.

Steinbeck’s next works, In Dubious Battle and Of Mice and Men, were both successful, and in 1938 his masterpiece The Grapes of Wrath was published. The novel, about the struggles of an Oklahoma family who lose their farm and become fruit pickers in California, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1939.

After World War II, Steinbeck’s work became more sentimental in such novels as Cannery Row and The Pearl. He also wrote several successful films, including Forgotten Village (1941) and Viva Zapata (1952). He became interested in marine biology and published a nonfiction book, The Sea of Cortez, in 1941. His travel memoir, Travels with Charlie, describes his trek across the United States in a camper. Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize in 1962 and died in New York in 1968.",mainstream,M0af28,flat.earth
893,"Shelter, fire, water and food: The dos and don’ts of wilderness survival

Preparedness is survival. When disaster strikes, you might find yourself stuck out in the wilderness, which can be treacherous and quite unforgiving, so knowing exactly what to do when venturing out can up your chances of making it out alive. (h/t to RealitySurvival.com)

How to survive out in the wilderness

Wilderness survival skills are an important part of any prepper’s arsenal, and will be especially useful for those who live in an urban area and have absolutely no experience with the wilderness at all. Here are a few things to take note of to keep yourself alive out in the wild.

Keep calm and use your head

When out in the wild, you should anticipate that things can go bad in no time and prepare accordingly. However, 0ne thing you should not do when out in the wilderness is panic. Panic can influence your mindset and decision-making, and can cause you to make irrational choices. Instead, you should collect yourself and start thinking of the best course of action to get you out of your current predicament.

For example, you shouldn’t waste daylight standing around feeling anxious, yet accomplishing nothing. If you want to get help, think about where the closest settlement is and start moving in the general direction before it gets dark.

Bad weather is something difficult to avoid when trying to survive out in the wilderness. In this case, knowledge on building a shelter is vital to protect yourself from exposure to the harmful elements. Getting wet even in mild temperatures can be a death sentence if you aren’t prepared.

Your shelter will depend on the resources available around you. Build your shelter as small as possible to be inconspicuous to the other denizens of the wilderness. An example shelter is to use branches and leaves and arrange them against a sturdy structure as a makeshift “roof.”

In any survival situation, finding water should be one of your priorities. An average person can survive about three days without drinking water, which decreases if he’s in a hotter climate. Even a few hours of dehydration can affect physical and mental capacity.

However, you can’t just drink any water you find. Many water sources are contaminated with bacteria and other pollutants that can be harmful to health. A conventional way to purify water is by using a water filter or purifier. You can also boil the water over a fire as an alternative.

Keep a knife on you

A knife is a versatile survival tool and can be used for a variety of purposes. From making shelters, hunting for food, to starting a fire, a knife will definitely come in handy when surviving out in the wilderness. However, a simple pocket knife wouldn’t last long. There are dedicated survival knives you can choose from that are much more durable.

If you must hunker down for the night, knowing how to make a fire can make life significantly easier. Not only can fire keep you warm and prevent problems like hypothermia, you can also use it to light up your immediate surroundings and cook food.

One of the easiest ways of having a fire ready at all times is by keeping some fire starter like matches or a lighter on your person. However, do not use flammable liquids like gasoline and lighter fluid, if you want to avoid unintentionally starting a forest fire.

427,"Between 542 and 66 million years ago—long before the “supervolcano” became part of Yellowstone’s geologic story—the area was covered by inland seas. 

 NPS/Jim Peaco

Most of Earth’s history (from the formation of the earth 4.6 billion years ago to approximately 541 million years ago) is known as the Precambrian time. Rocks of this age are found in northern Yellowstone and in the hearts of the Teton, Beartooth, Wind River, and Gros Ventre ranges. During the Precambrian and the subsequent Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras (541 to 66 million years ago), the western United States was covered at times by oceans, sand dunes, tidal flats, and vast plains. From the end of the Mesozoic through the early Cenozoic, mountain-building processes formed the Rocky Mountains.

 During the Cenozoic era (approximately the last 66 million years of Earth’s history), widespread mountain-building, volcanism, faulting, and glaciation sculpted the Yellowstone area.

Magma (molten rock from Earth’s mantle) has been close to the surface in Yellowstone for more than 2 million years. Its heat melted rocks in the crust, creating a magma chamber of partially molten, partially solid rock. Heat from this shallow magma caused an area of the upper crust to expand and rise. The Yellowstone Plateau became a geomorphic landform shaped by episodes of volcanic activity. Stress also caused rocks overlying the magma to break, forming faults and causing earthquakes. Eventually, these faults reached the deep magma chamber. Magma oozed through these cracks, releasing pressure within the chamber and allowing trapped gases to expand rapidly. A massive volcanic eruption then occurred along vents, spewing volcanic ash and gas into the atmosphere and causing fast super-hot debris (pyroclastic) flows on the ground. As the underground magma chamber emptied, the ground above it sunk, creating the first of Yellowstone’s three calderas.

This diagram shows the general ideas behind two theories of how magma rises to the surface. Adapted with permission from Windows into the Earth by Robert Smith and Lee J. Siegel, 2000.

Based on minerals from the last major eruption, the researchers found that the changes leading up to an eruption may happen in a matter of decades rather than thousands of years in advance as previously thought.

Supervolcanoes are characterized as volcanic centers that have had eruptions that covered more than 240 cubic miles. The US has two: one in Yellowstone and another in California’s Long Valley. An eruption could emit ash that would expand over 500 miles. The eruption would likely cover the ground with as much as 4 inches of gray ash, which could be detrimental to crops growing in the Midwest. Another less worrisome concern is the 1,000 degree F molten lava that could ooze out. Gases, including sulfur dioxide, which contributes to acid rain would be spewed from the supervolcano and the global cooling issues associated with reflecting sunlight away from the Earth are also concerns.

But there are other supervolcanos in the world with sooner predictions than Yellowstone’s. Campi Flegri, a name that aptly translates as “burning fields, is in a “critical state,” according to researchers in Italy. It consists of a vast and complex network of underground chambers that formed hundreds of thousands of years ago, stretching from the outskirts of Naples to underneath the Mediterranean Sea. Though its last eruption was in 1538, it’s due for an eruption soon. It would be a minor event compared to the 72 cubic miles of molten rock it spewed in its most notorious eruption 39,000 years ago, called Campanian Ignimbrite, that likely contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthals.

Fortune website article reported that if the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, it could shoot out more than 1,000 cubic kilometers of rock and ash into the air. That’s 250 cubic miles. That’s more than three times as large as the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption in Italy, which created a sulfurous cloud that floated more than 1,200 miles away to hang over Russia. That’s 2,500 times more material than Mount St. Helens expelled in 1980, killing 57 people. An eruption at Yellowstone would result in a cloud of ash more than 500 miles wide, stretching across nearly the entire western United States.

NASA has a plan to neutralize supervolcano threats however. They believe the most viable solution could be to drill up to 6 miles down into the supervolcano, and pump down water at high pressure. The circulating water would return at a temperature of around 662F, thus slowly day by day extracting heat from the volcano. And while such a project would come at an estimated cost of around $3.46 billion, it comes with an enticing catch which could convince politicians to make the investment. It would become a source of geothermal energy. But there are considerable risks, too. It could trigger the eruption it’s meant to save us from.

Historically, four types of volcanic events have taken place in Yellowstone (you may click on each one to learn more):

 1. Caldera Forming Eruptions — 2.1 and 1.3 million years ago

 2. Lava Flows — about 30 between 640,000 and 70,000 years ago

 3. Earthquakes — 1000 to 3000 yearly; last notable quake was in 1959

 4. Hydrothermal (Steam) Explosions — small explosions in the 20th century; a

 dozen or so major explosions between 14,000 and 3,000 years ago

The likelihood of an eruption in the near future is still low. However those who instigate such a project will never see it to completion, or even have an idea whether it might be successful within their lifetime. Cooling Yellowstone in this manner would happen at a rate of 3.2808399 feet a year, taking of the order of tens of thousands of years until just cold rock was left.

591,"While a majority of Americans are dancing in the streets over Donald J. Trump becoming their next President and “Making America Great Again,” there are those in the Environmental movement and the Scientific community, that are expressing their concerns. Some concerns are justified, while other concerns that are being voiced raise a “Red Flag.”

We have to wonder how much of these expressed concerns are paranoia from those of “left leaning” political views… those with “Junk Science” in their portfolios (CYA)… and still others with an agenda that will not hold up under the light of day.

Some environmental planners spend their careers mapping out worst-case scenarios. As of January 20, they’ve got one in the White House.

There’s a case to be made that the Trump Administration’s rollback of environmental regulation won’t be devastating; that market forces will prevail in the coming energy revolution; that the environment and public health will continue to be protected under the EPA and other agencies, and that state governments will do their part as well; and that a newly-elected President, self-branded as an astute businessman and dealmaker, will be open to the wisdom of ensuring a safe and healthy America.

But there are two fatal flaws with this argument: 1) You weren’t born yesterday; and 2) You don’t come to this page to be lied to.

The Trump Administration’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall-to-wall collection of zealots, ideologues and latter-day Robber Barons. Their collective message, both stated and implied, is that the American government’s ability to protect the environment, already besieged and underfunded, is on the brink of oblivion.

In early December, the cavalcade of aspirants and celebrities seeking an audience at Trump Tower included two high profile climate activists, former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. Gore’s visit was brokered by the First Daughter-Elect, Ivanka Trump.

The Trump Administration’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall-to-wall collection of zealots, ideologues and latter-day Robber Barons.

 Upon exiting, Gore told the press gaggle that meeting with the Trumps was “extremely interesting.” Combined with Trump’s declaration to the New York Times that he had an “open mind” about climate change, the wilted spirits of environmentalists were revived. Kudos to Gore and DiCaprio for making their case, but now, let’s return to climate reality.

He’s not let them down, helping to lead a battle—against the agency he’ll be in charge of if approved—on the Clean Power Plan, the Waters of the United States definition (WOTUS). WOTUS and the Clean Water Act hold a particular irony, since the anticipated assaults on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act could make it easier to drain real, not metaphoric, swamps from coast to coast.

A day after Gore’s meeting, Trump announced the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (Pictured left/Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. In his six years on the job in Oklahoma, Pruitt has enjoyed the support of keystone local industries, including fossil fuel and poultry.

State: Next was ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who vaulted past the likes of Rudy Guiliani and Gen. David Petraeus for the Secretary of State nomination. Months away from Exxon’s mandatory 65 year-old retirement age, Tillerson was a man in search of a hobby. Tillerson has acknowledged that human-caused climate change is real, and has endorsed both a carbon tax and the Paris climate agreement. He’s an Exxon lifer, with 41 years in the employ of a corporation that’s buried its own science affirming climate change, and that still funds climate denial groups. But don’t think he’s inexperienced in government or foreign policy. Steve Coll’s must-read 2012 book “Private Empire” makes the compelling case that Exxon functions as a sovereign petro-state, leveraging diplomatic pressure in virtually every corner of the Earth.

All told, the CEO of Exxon looks to be the most progressive voice on climate change in the Trump Administration. The CEO of Exxon. As Elizabeth Kolbert, the Pulitzer-winning New Yorker writer observed, “You have to be pretty desperate – and at this point many people are – to take this as cause for optimism.”

Related: He’s no Ronald Reagan DOE: Editorial cartoonists and late-night comics love Rick Perry, who, as its potential boss, probably now remembers that Department of Energy was one of those agencies he’d like to abolish.

The former Texas governor is actually a big fan of wind power, which he watched become a booming industry in his state. “You can be proud that Texas produces more energy from wind turbines than all but five countries,” he boasted upon leaving office in 2015.

He ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking as well, and last year joined the Board of Directors of Energy Transfer Partners, the builders of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Perry (Pictured left/Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) has also said that climate science is a conspiracy to keep climate scientists as wealthy as we all know that they are. While DOE has been home to groundbreaking clean energy research, the bulk of the department’s mission and budget goes to maintaining the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, and cleaning up the immense messes left by their manufacture.

Since leaving the Texas State House, Perry has kept himself busy with an unsuccessful appearance on “Dancing With the Stars,” and by turning back a criminal indictment for abuse of power as Governor. Step lightly, Guv.

Interior: Ryan Zinke (Pictured below/ Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) is a first-term Montana congressman who accepts that climate change is real. In the past, he’s called climate change a “threat multiplier,” but that Obama’s climate strategies would unleash “catastrophic” economic costs.

An avid hunter, Zinke says he’d like to see more intensive use of federal lands by both sportsmen and oil and gas drillers, and is expected to favor opening controversial export terminals to ship Montana and Wyoming coal across the Pacific. He does have credentials as a “hook and bullet” conservationist, including support for the crucial Land and Water Conservation Fund. That’s earned him opposition from western anti-environment groups like the American Land Rights Association.He earned a 3 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters in 2015. Unlike many on the Trump team, he’s voiced opposition for turning federal lands over to states.

Rick Perry ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking and last year joined the Board of Directors of Energy Transfer Partners, the builders of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Justice: If approved, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions would serve as Attorney General. He’s said that efforts to bring clean energy to developing nations would be a veritable assault on the world’s poorest people. He believes CO2 is a benign “plant food,” and famously launched a bizarre interrogation of EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy earlier this year.

Enough about the energy/environment bosses. The secondary players may be considerably worse. Many of these items are taken from first-rate reporting by Lyndsey Gilpin of High Country News, and research by Jenny Rowland and Erin Auel at the Center for American Progress. The CAP researchers documented that nearly every key member of the transition teams for EPA, Interior, and DOE worked for Koch-funded organizations or office-holders.

Energy: Thomas Pyle, a former lobbyist for both Koch Industries and the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, leads the transition team. He currently runs the Koch- and Exxon-funded Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that’s espoused a loosening of energy regulations and climate denial while denouncing wind energy.

A special moment came on December 14, when Energy transition team member Anthony Scaramucci appeared on CNN.

Anthony Scaramucci, a financial CEO and Fox Business News contributor, mixed it up with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo in mid-December. Cuomo repeatedly asked his guest about whether climate change is real. Citing Flat Earth Theory, Scaramucci took a deep dive into the manufacture of doubt.

Funny thing: Scaramucci was asked the same question six months ago and declared climate science to be “irrefutable.” For good measure, and possibly with his new boss in mind, he added back in June, “I find it tragic that so many people in this country believe global warming is some sort of elaborate hoax perpetuated by every credible scientist on the planet.”

Other Energy Department transition officials include two more former Koch Industries lobbyists, Mike McKenna and Mike Catanzaro. Catanzaro also served a stint as Communications Director for uber-denier Sen. James Inhofe. Team member William Greene is Deputy Legislative Director for the Safari Club International, which has lobbied for trophy-hunting exemptions from the Endangered Species Act.

Transitioner Daniel Simmons comes from two Koch-funded groups, IER and ALEC.

Somewhere on this DOE team, an unidentified someone has been “counseled.” Those were the announced consequences for distributing a questionnaire to DOE employees that, among other things, sought to identify anyone at the agency who had participated in climate-related meetings.

After an uproar, and a refusal by current DOE staff to comply, the Trump team disowned the questionnaire and its McCarthy Era overtones (In fairness to Senator Joe McCarthy, he was nowhere near as forgiving with the Russians).

NASA Transition head Chris Shank is the #2 staffer to House Science Committee Chair Lamar Smith, and is expected to steer the agency away from its vital Earth science and climate change research.

Commerce: The Commerce Department’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is NASA’s government counterpart in climate research. Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross has made billions on rescuing and leveraging distressed companies, including coal, oil and gas firms. He’s acknowledged that climate change is a thing, offering suggestions to boost rail traffic and invest in ethanol as climate fixes.

Ross’s International Coal Group owned the Sago Mine in West Virginia. In January 2006, 13 miners were trapped in an explosion at the mine. Only one was rescued. In 2011, Ross sold ICG to Arch Coal for a reported $3.4 billion.

There’s little indication that NOAA’s climate science is nearly as much in the crosshairs as NASA’s. But, as one former Commerce official told me, “maybe they just haven’t gotten to it yet.”

EPA: Myron Ebell is a veteran political operative guiding EPA’s transition team. Ebell dodges the “denier” label via a few old climate-denial standards: In the past, he’s either said that climate change is “nothing to worry about,” or that it will be awesome when fewer people die from the cold in a warming world.

When hackers stole thousands of emails from climate scientists in 2009, Ebell described the climate science community as a “gang” that was “without honor.” Multiple investigations cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing.

Also on the team are attorneys David Schnare and Chris Horner of the American Tradition Institute. Schnare and Horner have specialized in filing lawsuits and sweeping Freedom of Information Act requests against prominent climate scientists. Bankruptcy filings by coal companies have revealed their funding for Schnare’s and Horner’s work.

National Security Team: K.T. McFarland, (Pictured left/Credit: Gage Skidmore/flickr) another Fox contributor, would become Deputy National Security Advisor. She’s denounced the Obama Administration for citing climate change as a global security issue.

Monica Crowley, still another appointee drained from Fox News, will handle the press for National Security Advisor Mike Flynn. She recently called global warming “a way of separating Americans and Westerners from God and organized religion, and it’s also a wealth redistribution scheme.”

CIA: Wichita-based Congressman Mike Pompeo counts on David and Charles Koch as his constituents. He’s been a business partner with Koch Industries through an oil supply firm, and has said that President Obama is “horribly wrong” about climate change posing a global security risk.

Interior: Doug Domenech is a former Virginia state official who blames the “regulatory war on coal” for tough times in Appalachia, and says that the miracle mineral can relieve energy poverty. But coal jobs have been on a steady swan dive since the Reagan Administration due to mechanization.

Other Interior transition staffers include attorney Daniel Jorjani, who works for the Koch’s Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce. Authors Alyssa Katz describes this effort as having bankrolled anti-regulatory campaigns by the U.S. Chamber and others with $255 million in 2012 alone.

Congressional staffer Harlan Watson served as chief climate negotiator under President George W. Bush. A leaked memo from ExxonMobil, written shortly after Bush’s inauguration, sang Watson’s praises and recommended him for a role in climate policy.

And a few more: As Transportation Secretary-designate, Elaine Chao would lead on major infrastructure projects, including the Obama Administration’s plans to ramp up electric vehicle charging stations nationwide. Chao resigned her seat on the Bloomberg Philanthropies Board in 2015 when the charity decided to increase its support of the Sierra Club’s “Beyond Coal” campaign. She is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – a helpful reminder that sometimes, guilt by association means that you’re guilty.

Linda McMahon, nominee for the Small Business Administration, has cited “conflicting science on both sides of this issue.” The former World Wrestling Entertainment executive didn’t go so far as to declare climate science is fake and has a predetermined outcome.

Senior Counselor Steve Bannon’s Breitbart News site regularly touts climate denial. Bannon accused the Pope of “hysteria” for embracing climate action. Domestic transition head Ken Blackwell believes that climate models are rigged, and the science is a “hoax.” HUD nominee Ben Carson has said there’s “no overwhelming science” on climate change. Chief of Staff Reince Preibus said “melting icebergs aren’t beheading Christians in the Middle East.” UN Ambassador nominee Nikki Haley fought the Clean Power Plan as South Carolina Governor, even as her state endured lethal, record-smashing downpours. And Vice President-Elect Mike Pence has at times said climate change is real, but that government policy can’t impact it. But he’s also called it a “myth.”

948,"In 1995, a woman by the name of Nancy Lieder claimed to have had contact with extraterrestrial beings known as Zetas. She was visited by one of her “hybrid sons” and was being prepared for a role as a messenger for the Zetas (Zeta Talk). Nancy eventually quit her full time job in California and moved to Wisconsin to pursue her new appointed position as messenger for the Zetas (Zeta Talk). Official information from the Zetas can be found online at Zeta Talk. Since 1995, the Zetas have been revealing to Nancy plans they have for the human race as well as predictions of future events and catastrophes. In the early 2000s, Nancy made a wrong prediction of an event occurring and lost a large number of followers, yet a close knit following still remains. The belief is extraordinary because the only evidence is word of mouth.

Nancy Lieder is the only contact with the Zetas. She proclaims many elaborate facts of realities not yet known to mankind and is quite thorough in their descriptions. So far, Nancy has been unable to accurately make predictions of future events stating that the Zetas can be wrong sometimes (Zeta Talk). Nancy also does not have any physical evidence of the existence of Zetas, but in a video she posted on YouTube, she describes a scene she experienced with a Zeta in such great detail that it would be surprising if it were not real. But, again, the impressive detail and other anecdotal visions is the only evidence of Zeta existence.

In the eyes of those invested in the belief, Nancy Lieder has asserted herself in a position of high credibility and authority through the telling’s complex rules to live by, predictions of catastrophes, and enlightened happenings of the “aftertime” where alien-kind and humankind openly walk amongst each other. Nancy, as the contact, uses modern events like global warming as verification of the Zeta’s predictions, which her followers believe. Those who are devout in their belief are misinterpreting real evidence of earthly phenomena as doings of the Zetas.

There is a consistent community of Zeta believers on social media, and those that participate in the community are actively adopting this belief more and more into their self concepts. In other words, the belief is taking up residents in their personal identity, which means that being a part of the group who is becoming who they are. When multiple people commune with each other in this way, a bond is formed amongst the group and it becomes larger than they are as individuals.

One of the most prominent aspects of Nancy’s messages is the “aftertime” and what life after death will look like. According to Terror Management Theory, people will pursue meaningful experiences as well as beliefs that buffer against the fear of the inevitability of death. Since Zeta’s messages expand into description of life after death, many people find refuge in the belief that people will one day live amongst aliens.

941,"In a ""show of force,"" the U.S. Navy dispatched an aircraft carrier and five escort ships to the South China Sea amid rising tensions between the U.S., China and other Southeast Asian nations claiming territory in the disputed region, multiple defense officials confirmed to Fox News Friday.

The dispatch sends a signal to China that the U.S. Navy will continue to conduct freedom of navigation patrols even as China continues to ""militarize"" islands, those officials say.

The Navy Times reported Thursday the U.S. sent the USS John C. Stennis, two destroyers, two cruisers and the 7th Fleet flagship. The deployment comes after Defense Secretary Ash Carter warned China over the militarization of its claimed artificial islands.

The Stennis was joined by the Japan-based cruisers Antietam and Mobile Bay and destroyers Chung-Hoon and Stockdale, according to the Navy Times. The command ship USS Blue Ridge, is also in the area and is heading for the Philippines. Officials said the Antietam was conducting a separate patrol from the Stennis.

Tensions have increased over the last month after it was learned that China had placed surface-to-air-missiles on one of the Paracel Islands. Since the incident, U.S. Pacific Command Chief Adm. Harry Harris has sea that China is militarizing the region.

“In my opinion China is clearly militarizing the South China Sea,” Harris testified on Feb. 24. “You’d have to believe in a flat Earth to believe otherwise.”

The U.S. has completed patrols within the 12-mile limit of China’s artificial islands. Last October, the destroyer Lassen went through the region and on Jan. 30, the destroyer Curtis Wilbur sailed near Trinton Island, part of the Paracel Islands.

Carter took a harsh tone Tuesday speaking at a conference in San Francisco. He said if China doesn’t heed the warning to stop militarizing the region, the U.S. was prepared to increase military deployments to the Asia-Pacific region and would spend nearly $425 million to pay for more joint military exercise with countries that feel threatened by Beijing.

“China must not pursue militarization in the South China Sea,” China said in a speech in San Francisco. “Specific actions will have specific consequences.”

Meanwhile, a Philippine official said he spotted five Chinese coast guard and navy ships at the Jackson Atoll last week that have not been previously stationed there before. However, by Wednesday the ships were gone.

China also announced Friday it will boost defense spending 7 to 8 percent in 2016, its smallest increase in six years. However, it will still have the world’s largest standing military in the world.

The U.S. and other Southeast Asian governments with rival claims, have expressed alarm over China's island construction, saying it raises tensions, threatens regional stability and could violate freedom of navigation and overflight.

Aside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have conflicting territorial claims in the Spratlys.

43,"Justin Bieber released a new single called Yummy and it seems to be custom made to piss people off. For starters, the song’s brain-numbing hook is somewhat infuriating in its own right. It’s like it was written for toddlers.

However, the verses make it clear that the actual subject of the song is very adult and very sexual.

Here’s an example of suggestive lyrics:

While Bieber is clearly not the first artist to release a pop song with sexual innuendo, the promotion surrounding the single makes things extremely weird and uncomfortable. Whoever handler’s Bieber’s Instagram account decided it would be a good idea to post pictures of random babies with the hashtag “Yummy”.

Here are some examples.

Bieber’s IG account contains many more pictures of babies. To make things even weirder, Bieber also posted the song’s title with pizza letters.

It is now a widely known fact that “pizza” is a code word used in pedophile circles. It even became a meme in internet forums such as 4Chan. To those who understand the sick codes of these people, the combination of the song’s lyrics with pictures of babies and the word “Yummy” written in pizza letters is difficult to ignore.

Another widely known meme associated with these creeps is pedobear. Here’s another post on Bieber’s IG account in the midst of the Yummy promotional blitz.

To make things even stranger, the music video adds another layer of “what in hell?”

The music video takes place in a posh restaurant that is attended by posh-looking people. It’s the type of place people in the elite would go to.

At the beginning of the video, the camera lingers on children playing music.

While the children are playing, Bieber enjoys weird food with some weird-looking people.

Considering the subject matter of the song, one can easily interpret that this orgy of food is actually meant to represent an orgy of people. The close-ups of people suggestively eating food are not very subtle.

The final frame of the video explains what the food in the video actually represents. That frame is so symbolically important that it was also posted on Bieber’s Instagram account.

The final frame basically says that the dishes represent children. They are being “tasted”. And Bieber is a victim of the very system he is celebrating in the video.

What is Happening With Bieber?

Some might wonder why Bieber is partaking in this is creepy and overt child-loving stuff while he could, like, not do it. The short answer is: He doesn’t have a choice. Since the very beginning of his career, Bieber was always an industry pawn, with little or no control over his career. As the last frame of Yummy appears to say, Bieber himself might have been abused by creeps in the music industry.

Others wonder why Bieber – who is a devout and outspoken Christian – is partaking in this occult elite stuff. Indeed, there are lots of Jesus-related posts on his IG account (although weirdly mixed with creepy, Yummy-related pictures). However, to get a better picture of what is happening here, we need to look at Bieber’s church: The powerful, star-studded Hillsong Church.

The Church is famously attended by various stars such as Selena Gomez, Kylie and Kendall Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens, Nick Jonas, Hailee Steinfeld, and Bono. All of them are pawns of the occult elite.

The founder of the church Brian Houston also has close ties with the political elite of Australia.

All of this elite endorsement happened despite the fact that the Church has a dark secret: The father of the Church’s founder Frank Houston admitted to abusing several young boys in Australia and New Zealand. And the leadership of the Church did everything possible to cover-up this sordid affair.

Frank Houston, the father of Hillsong Church founder Brian Houston, was a pastor in New Zealand and Australia who abused as many as nine boys over the course of his ministry. In the 1960s and ’70s, one victim was routinely subjected to sexual abuse from the age of 7 to 12. In 1999, his mother reported the abuse to the church. Although Brian Houston was legally obligated to report the crime, he did not do so. The victim later testified to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that Frank Houston offered him AU$10,000 as compensation at a McDonald’s in the presence of Hillsong Church elder Nabi Saleh. During an internal church investigation, Frank Houston eventually confessed to the crime. The commission also heard that he was involved in the sexual abuse of other children in New Zealand. Frank Houston resigned from his church in 2000, which then merged with Hillsong Church. Contrary to what is stated in Frank Houston’s resignation letter, he retired from the position of senior pastor of Sydney Christian Life Centre in May 1999 and was never employed by Hillsong Church. A further internal investigation by Assemblies of God in Australia, in conjunction with the Assemblies of God in New Zealand, found six additional child sexual abuse allegations, which were regarded as credible. In 2015, the royal commission examined allegations that accused Brian Houston of concealing his father’s crimes and censured him for failing to report his father to the police. In November 2018, 60 Minutes aired a segment revisiting the sexual abuse scandal, because newly revealed documentation allegedly reveals that Brian Houston was deeply involved in a cover-up and that Frank Houston’s abusive behaviour was worse than initially thought. Brian Houston allegedly used his position within the Assemblies of God in Australia denomination to conceal his father’s serial child sexual abuse. The matter was referred to the New South Wales Police Force, which confirmed that Brian Houston was under criminal investigation for failing to report a serious crime. Following the 60 Minutes story, Hillsong released a statement in response to the allegations.

So, to circle back to the title of the article: Why did Justin Bieber tag babies “Yummy” on Instagram? Because he is a pawn of the entertainment industry which is controlled by some very sick people.

Since the beginning of his career, Bieber has been caught up in a never-ending whirlwind of strange, humiliating events and has often displayed bizarre behavior. He’s always been a “whipping boy” of the industry and the face of crappy pop music. With Yummy, the pattern continues. His handlers purposely turned Yummy into some kind of “child-lover” anthem by associating it with overt imagery and creepy Instagram posts.

In short, Bieber was used to push one of the elite’s favorite agendas: The normalization and the celebration of child abuse.

1248,"Editor's note: ""Glenn Beck"" is on Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET.

NEW YORK (CNN) -- We all want to live in a world that's clean, healthy and prosperous.

We all want to hand that world off to our children in slightly better shape than we received it. No one, even the supposedly evil oil executive, has any reason to want anything different. But, for some reason, we find ourselves searching for villains. Surely they exist, but the endless quest to create them sometimes overwhelms our better judgment, whether intentional or not.

Congress has picked ""Big Oil"" as their enemy of the week. These companies inexplicably put profits above people, ravaging the environment and financially assaulting the poor to put another couple of dollars on their balance sheet. That's the storyline we've all been taught.

Yes, times are tough for many. Sure, oil companies make a lot of cash. But, for that money, they get us to work, get ambulances to the hospital, keep our homes warm, and employ thousands of our friends and neighbors while financing their retirement, paying their health care, and providing energy to millions. Because of capitalism, they have the incentive to do that. I've yet to see what our government does for us with their rather large chunk of each gallon of gas we buy, and I've yet to see them offer to return it or suggest a gas-tax-windfall-tax-tax.

The other villain of the moment is the global warming ""denier."" Anyone who disagrees, even in the slightest, must be ridiculed. On ""60 Minutes"" last weekend, Al Gore said: ""They're almost like the ones who still believe that the moon landing was staged in a movie lot in Arizona and those who believe the Earth is flat. That demeans them a little bit, but it's not that far off.""

Approximately 6 percent of Americans believe in the fake moon landing theory, although I've always heard there was a conspiratorial consensus that it was staged in Nevada, not Arizona. I'm going to guess quite a bit less than 6 percent believe in a flat Earth, but no one seems to be asking that question in polls anymore, so I can't be sure. So, who are those people Gore was demeaning ""a little bit"" by these comparisons? There's a good chance it's you. That's because the vast majority of Americans believe something that categorizes them as a flat earther to environmentalists like Gore.

Despite the media's one-sided view (the Business and Media Institute says dissenting voices about global warming are outnumbered on CBS News broadcasts by a 38 to 1 ratio), only 21 percent of Americans say ""the release of greenhouse gasses is the most important factor causing global warming"" according to a 2007 New York Times/CBS News poll.

The ""60 Minutes"" piece wasn't just filled with misrepresentations of opinion; it had plenty of Gore-style hypocrisy. He was embroiled in controversy when it was revealed his mansion used 20 times more energy than the average American. His explanation? ""Since then"" his house has been retrofitted with solar panels. I'm sure Eliot Spitzer hasn't been renting many women since he was caught either. (Although I'm not betting my life on it.)

We then see footage of Gore's parents' farm that will, sometime in the future, be run on wind power. Apparently, the windmill store has been out of stock for the past 20 years.

Perhaps most comically, Gore is seen dragging an entire film crew on a jet to India to give a climate presentation to about 100 people. Gore claimed: ""We just don't have any choice. I wish I knew a better way to do it. I constantly ask myself, 'How can I be more effective in getting this message across?' "" The most effective thing you can think of is flying halfway across the world to speak with 100 people? Maybe you had other things to do while you were there, but I'd be surprised if there was anything essential that couldn't be accomplished with a telephone and a computer. The people in India will be able to see your fancy graphs on their screens, and you'll cut demand for those evil overseas flights.

The entire ""60 Minutes"" piece felt like a commercial for Gore's upcoming commercials. He's spending $300 million in advertising to convince people of something he claims there is already a consensus on. To put that much money into perspective; it's more than Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Hillary Clinton, Sen. John Edwards, Sen. John McCain, former Gov. Mike Huckabee and Rep. Ron Paul raised in all of last year combined. Think of it as going green by getting lots of green.

Where is all that money coming from? Gore says he's donating his profits from ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" and his Nobel Peace Prize cash award. Let's be generous and say there's only $290 million left to explain. Apparently, a follow-up question to find the origins of this nine-figure sum would have involved six seconds that ""60 Minutes"" wasn't willing to commit.

What is there to learn from all of this? Whether it's politicians on both sides of the aisle or our vaunted environmental superheroes, the quest for power overwhelms even the slightest instinct of self-examination.

In the end, the timing of the Gore interview airing couldn't have been better. It fell on the same weekend as the first ""Earth Hour,"" when the world supposedly came together to turn our attention to climate change by shutting the lights off for an hour. The imagery of monuments like the Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois, going dark was plastered over newscasts everywhere.

But those pictures highlighted the global warming movement and the congressional attacks on energy companies in an entirely unintended way.

Behind the darkened Sears Tower was the city of Chicago, with lights shining brightly as far as the eye could see. For one hour the Sears Tower knew what it was like to be Al Gore: A larger than life symbol, blocking our view of reality.

712,"As the consequences of light pollution have become more visible, lighting regulations have started to evolve. Canada passed bird-friendly lighting (and construction) laws in the mid-1990s, and now numerous cities—including Toronto, Washington, D.C., and New York—participate in lights-out campaigns during peak migration seasons. And in 2016, the American Medical Association responded to the growing body of evidence suggesting that intense LEDs are harmful to human health by recommending that communities change streetlights to “minimize and control blue-rich environmental lighting.”

Entire cities are even re-doing their lights in an attempt to reclaim the night and decrease energy waste. Flagstaff, Arizona, was the first city to be designated a Dark Sky Community by the International Dark-Sky Association, and Chicago is in the process of retrofitting its fixtures.

So far, hesitations about dimmer, sparser lighting causing an uptick in crime or decreased safety at night have not been supported by the data; in Chicago’s West Garfield Park, more brightly lit alleys actually led to an increase in reported crime. And anecdotally, people are finding that less glaring lighting makes it easier to see in unlit areas, because our eyes adapt more quickly to the dark.

For some cities, eliminating light pollution is also a way to increase tourism revenue while strengthening humanity’s connection to the night sky. Consider the town of Jasper, Alberta. Nestled in the remote Canadian Rockies, Jasper is a haven for those who love the mountains, wildlife, and the outdoors. Just a few minutes drive outside town, stargazers can see a dazzling array of nighttime wonders, from oft-hidden stars and satellites to meteorites and the aurora borealis.

Since 2010, the city has hosted a Dark Sky Festival in the fall that brings in thousands of people. But Jasper residents aren’t content to have the nighttime wonders visible only just beyond their borders. The town is now working with Lumican, a Canadian company that partners with the International Dark-Sky Association, to re-do all its streetlights. Slated to start this summer, the town’s roughly 400 fixtures will be replaced with shielded Lumican LEDs set to color temperatures ranging between 1,700 and 2,200 Kelvin, which efficiently cast an amber glow while limiting more harmful blue wavelengths.

“What caught our attention at first was how horrible all these new LED street lights looked; so glary, prison-like, and overly bright,” says Lumican’s Lara Mitchell. When she realized that such street lighting erases stars and damages ecosystems, the company turned toward fighting light pollution.

Throughout North America and Europe, dark sky parks are on the rise, and festivals like Jasper’s are flourishing. People are beginning to reconnect with the sparkling canvas that swirls overhead just as technologies are becoming available on scales that will help humanity reclaim more of this natural nighttime majesty—if we choose to use them.

Christopher Kyba, the scientist who studies light pollution on a global level, points to van Gogh’s “Cafe Terrace at Night” as his image of an ideal nighttime scene.

“This is the dream of what you want to have—nice, warm, uniform lighting. You can see lots of stars up above, the facades are unlit,” he says. “You look a hundred-something years in the past to see the idealized lighting.”",mainstream,M0c4ec,flat.earth
123,"12 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:

2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.

3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.

6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.

7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.

9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.

11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.

12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.

13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.

16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.

17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

462,"On Reddit, some “Game of Thrones” fans subscribe to a tortuous theory that a group of old, scholarly men — the maesters — are part of a sprawling and hidden conspiracy to exert control over the show’s mythical kingdom. They write thousands of words to each other proving that every obscure clue adds up to a big picture that only they can see.

Just a few clicks away, other Reddit users are sure that a secretive group — the Illuminati — is part of a sprawling and hidden conspiracy to control the real world. They do exactly the same thing.

There are some clear parallels between fan conspiracy theories and political conspiracy theories. They were once confined to the far corners of American culture, but in recent years have flourished thanks in part to internet message boards and social media, which offer anyone the opportunity to publish, debunk, rebunk and remix their own imaginary concepts and share them with like-minded theorists.

The theories, however, share more than just message boards. The psychology of groups and the internet’s propensity to amplify outlandish content and reward the people who create it has created the kind of feedback loops in which bizarre theories — from both fantasy fans and the politically paranoid — flourish.

Russell Zimmerman, 41, a writer, game developer and military historian, loves to theorize about “Game of Thrones,” particularly the books on which it is based, George R.R. Martin’s series, “A Song of Ice and Fire.” But some theories are even too much for him, such as one that argues one character (Varys, the spymaster) is secretly a sea creature.

“To me, that's about the level of ‘out there’ crazy-talk as assuming there's a kiddie porn ring in the basement of a pizza shop without a basement,” he said, referring to the “pizzagate” conspiracy theory that remains popular on the fringes of the far right.

“Thrones” is not the only show with a strong internet following and crackpot theories.

The popular Adult Swim show “Rick and Morty” has various fan guesses at the show’s secrets. BBC’s “Doctor Who,” which follows a time-traveling human-looking alien exploring the universe, has its own theories. And in the early days of the consumer internet, “The X-Files,” a show that often touched on real-life conspiracy theories, gave birth to some of the first online fan theories.

Meanwhile, any number of real-world conspiracy theories have taken hold among various political and social groups on the internet.

Joseph Uscinski, associate professor of political science at the University of Miami and author of “Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Believe Them,” said diehard fans and conspiracy theorists share a love of extrapolating from the facts in their possession.

“Conspiracy theories are similar to fan fiction in that they both allow people to make up whatever they want,” he said.

Uscinski said that whether it’s “Game of Thrones,” “Star Wars” or the JFK assassination, people can take a plot or an event and “go to wherever they want with it.”

As an example, Uscinski cited Qanon, a remarkably popular genre of conspiracy theories that generally center on a mysterious figure who claims that President Donald Trump is working to uncover a powerful group of pedophiles.

“You have this anonymous poster, Q, who puts out nonsensical clues and people try to make sense of it and try to figure out what happens next,” he said. “They are enjoying this. They like piecing these things together. It’s a fan thing for them.”

Brendon Boutin, 32, who runs a popular “Game of Thrones” recap channel, “Man of Recaps,” said the excitement generated by both kinds of theories drove their popularity.

“I think the biggest similarity is the feeling you get, the rush of hunting for the truth and discovering secret knowledge,” Boutin said by email. “I watched some 9/11 ‘Truth’ videos back in the day, and those brought about the same thrill as discovering Jon Snow's parentage.”

“Game of Thrones” is far from the only show to have a fervent fanbase that has created its own theories, but few have created a community as rich and active, both online and off. Laurel Steinberg, a New York-based relationship therapist, said the behavior shown by conspiracy theorists and superfans is “absolutely analogous.”

“People like to feel part of a group, part of a movement, part of a team,” Steinberg said. “It feels good to have something that gives them a identity. It feels good to have something to be excited about, and watch develop in real time.”

But “Thrones” fandom is also susceptible to the same internet dynamics that have spurred ever-more outlandish conspiracy theories, rewarding people who can draw the most attention.

“You're able to create community, and then become an expert. You’ve ridden the tailcoats of the star and then you become a breakout star in that community,” Steinberg said.”You become an influencer.”

Chloe Ketchum, 27, who co-hosts a podcast about the series, “Girls Gone Canon,” said that while she enjoys the feeling of community around “Game of Thrones,” she’s also seen the lengths some fans will go to attract a following.

“There are creators that push shock value to get views,” Ketchum said. “People will do anything for attention.”

While there are similarities in the psychology behind intense fandoms and political conspiracists, Uscinski stressed that they result in divergent behaviors. He said fans will generally abandon theories that don’t hold up, whereas conspiracy theorists ignore evidence that proves them wrong.

There’s also the real-world consequences. Conspiracy theories around politics and current events have inspired some people to commit acts of violence, which has led to efforts by politicians and activist groups to force internet platforms to reign in the spread of the disinformation that can fuel the theories.

“When the show comes out, people will disregard their theories that didn’t turn out to be true,” he said. “But with flat earthers, when they do an experiment and it doesn’t show them what they want, they still hold that belief anyway. They’re much more invested”",mainstream,M0dbd4,flat.earth; illuminati

737,"Taiwan president-elect TsaiIng-wen must ""prove"" her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is not pro-independence before Beijing will deal with her, a senior member of China's largely rubber stamp parliament said on Thursday.

China considers self-ruled Taiwan a wayward province, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 after the Chinese civil war.

Beijing has repeatedly warned against any moves towards independence since January's landslide win by Tsai and her DPP in presidential and parliamentary elections. Tsai assumes office in May.

While the DPP's charter calls for the island's formal independence, senior DPP leaders have not publicly stated that clause of late and Tsai has said she wishes to have peace with China and to maintain the status quo.

Speaking on the sidelines of China's annual parliamentary session, Wang Yifu, who leads the Chinese-appointed Taiwan delegation to parliament, said the DPP's independence platform ""makes the world feel uneasy"".

Wang had been asked by a reporter to comment on Tsai's pledge to develop bilateral relations under the framework of Taiwan's constitution which stipulates that Taiwan and the Chinese mainland are part of ""one China"".

Tsai's pledge ""contradicts"" the independence clause in the DPP's own charter, Wang said, adding that she and the DPP would have to ""prove (the DPP) is not a Taiwan independence party"".

""This is the basis for cross-Strait exchanges,"" said Wang, who is also president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots - a Chinese government group composed of Taiwanese exiles, defectors and their descendants.

The DPP did not respond to a request for comment.

China appoints a Taiwan delegation to parliament every year to back up its sovereignty claims over the island, even though nobody in proudly democratic Taiwan votes for them.

Wang stopped short of spelling out whether China wants the DPP to drop, revise or freeze the independence clause in its charter.

Wang urged DPP leaders to ""appreciate and reciprocate the mainland's goodwill"".

Chinese President Xi Jinping said last week China would never allow the historical tragedy of Taiwan being ""split"" off from the rest of the country to happen again, warning the island against any moves towards formal independence.

532,"Hillary Clinton’s abrupt departure from a Sept. 11 ceremony in New York after falling ill Sunday and the subsequent disclosure that she is suffering from pneumonia are likely to intensify scrutiny on the Democratic nominee’s health and potentially inject a new campaign issue into a race between two of the oldest candidates ever to seek the White House.

Clinton supporters had long dismissed concerns about her health as baseless, insisting that she only suffered from allergies. But Sunday’s incident — along with a video appearing to show Clinton having difficulty standing on her own — will only amplify such questions just as the race enters its final weeks.

The incident also could increase pressure on Clinton, 68, and Republican nominee Donald Trump, 70, to release more information about their health. Clinton has disclosed less than some previous candidates. Donald Trump has released almost nothing.

“This is the kind of thing that voters have a right to understand before they cast a vote,” said Katie Packer, a GOP strategist who says she does not support either Trump or Clinton.

“Both Trump and Hillary are elderly. They are obligated to release full medical records and full tax returns to the American people. And the media, party leaders and American people should settle for nothing less.”

The pneumonia diagnosis comes as the campaign enters its most grueling phase, weeks before the first presidential debate and as voters start heading to the polls in states with early voting. Her doctor, who made the diagnosis Friday, has advised Clinton to curtail her schedule. But the Democratic candidate did not appear to skip any planned events over the weekend, including a fundraiser in New York headlined by Barbra Streisand.

After the incident, Clinton’s campaign said late Sunday it was canceling a planned trip to California on Monday and Tuesday for fundraisers and a taping of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”

Clinton’s lung infection comes after a tough week for her campaign, with polls showing a tightening of the race against Trump. Then over the weekend, Clinton was forced to partially walk back comments she made referring to half of Trump’s supporters as “deplorables.”

The new scrutiny of her health will add to these problems.

“Forty-eight hours ago, this was something for the Flat Earth Society and the birth certificate deniers,” Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said of the speculation about Clinton’s health. “Now it’s a topic of legitimate, mainstream political discussion.”

Although Clinton’s opponents will surely make an issue of her having pneumonia, her campaign’s relatively quick release of the diagnosis marked a significant step toward transparency for a candidate who has often shied away from disclosing information she considers private.

But some critics complained that Clinton did not reveal the potentially debilitating condition Friday when it was diagnosed. And after she fell ill Sunday morning, her campaign initially attributed it to “overheating” and waited nearly seven hours — as rumors and speculation about her health swirled — until disclosing the pneumonia.

For Clinton, perhaps the most damaging part of the day was the 19-second video of her struggling to leave the event in New York City. The video, quickly circulated online and replayed on cable news channels, shows her standing uneasily, her knees appearing to buckle and needing help to get into her van.

A spokesman said immediately afterward that Clinton left the ceremony at the site of the World Trade Center about 9:30 a.m. because she felt unwell. Reporters who were traveling with Clinton were not told about her condition or her whereabouts for 90 minutes after she left the ceremony.

“Secretary Clinton attended the Sept. 11th commemoration ceremony for just an hour and 30 minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of the families of the fallen,” spokesman Nick Merrill said in the initial statement released by the campaign. “During the ceremony, she felt overheated so departed to go to her daughter’s apartment, and is feeling much better.”

The weather was in the low 80s and humid.

Clinton spent about two hours at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment and emerged shortly before noon wearing sunglasses, greeting a young girl and waved at diners at a nearby restaurant.

“I’m feeling great. It’s a beautiful day in New York,” Clinton said before heading to her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.

Her personal physician examined her at her house Sunday afternoon and said Clinton was recovering.

“While at this morning’s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely,” said Dr. Lisa R. Bardack in a statement. Bardack said Clinton was put on antibiotics Friday.

Clinton’s health has long been the speculation of conspiracy theorists. In 2014, a People magazine cover of Clinton in her backyard leaning on a chair prompted speculation that she was leaning on a walker.

But innuendo about her health grew markedly during the presidential campaign as Trump and his surrogates, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, routinely questioned her strength and stamina on the campaign trail.

Trump was uncharacteristically silent Sunday after news of Clinton’s illness emerged.

Republicans have also pointed to coughing fits that Clinton has suffered while campaigning, and which she attributes to seasonal allergies. Her opponents have also raised questions about the effect of a concussion she sustained in 2012.

The drumbeat got to the point that Clinton poked fun at it on late-night television. During an August appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” she pretended to exert great effort as she opened a jar of pickles and asked the host to check her pulse.

Clinton dismissed the attacks as “wacky” and noted that critics have claimed “I would be dead in six months,” she said. “So with every breath I take I feel like I have a new lease on life.”

723,"The Flat Earth model is a conspiracy theory surrounding the concept that the Earth is a flat, disc-shaped plane, surrounded by ice. Many ancient cultures subscribed to the idea but it was made famous again in modern times thanks to the creation of a Flat Earth society by Samuel Shenton in 1956. Mark Sargent, an avid member of the club and author of several books on the topic, revealed one reason why he believes it is more than just a conspiracy.

Speaking during Netflix documentary “Behind the Curve”, Mr Sargant claimed his theory was superior to everything NASA has told us for years. Taking the production crew to a beach near his home, Mr Sargant pointed at the city of Seattle across the water. He said in 2018: “Here’s an example if you want to see it real quick. “So like the buildings in the distance – right out there – that is Seattle.

“You should not be able to see it. “There should be hundreds of feet of curvature between us and them.” Mr Sargant went on to dismiss any scientific reasoning for the revelation, before claiming the Flat Earth theory answers all the questions. He added: “You can say it’s refraction, or it’s atmospheric effects, no – not in every weather condition, not in every light condition. “This is why science is having a problem combating what we are doing.

“Neil deGrasse Tyson says it’s a growing anti-intellectual movement which borders on the end of civilisation as we know it. “But the reason why we’re winning versus science, is science just throws back maths. Neil deGrasse Tyson is an American astrophysicist author and leading science figure.

He has been a long time supporter of NASA, claiming the space agency deserves more funding and backing by the general public. In March 2012, he testified before the United States Senate Science Committee, stating: ""Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. ""For twice that – a penny on a dollar – we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th-century birthright to dream of tomorrow."" Mr Tyson also runs his own YouTube channel – StarTalk – where he has previously called out Flat Earthers. He said in March 2018: “We have videos from space of the rotating spherical Earth – the Earth is round.",mainstream,M07c78,flat.earth
63,"“The folksiness will irk some critics … But criticizing Friedman for humanizing and boiling down big topics is like complaining that Mick Jagger used sex to sell songs: It is what he does well.” –John Micklethwait, review of Thank You for Being Late, in The New York Times

With apologies to Mr. Micklethwait, the hands that typed these lines implying Thomas Friedman is a Mick Jagger of letters should be chopped off and mailed to the singer’s doorstep in penance. Mick Jagger could excite the world in one note, while Thomas Friedman needs 461 pages to say, “Shit happens.” Joan of Arc and Charles Manson had more in common.

Thomas Friedman was once a man of great influence. His columns were must-reads for every senator and congressperson. He helped spread the globalization gospel and push us into war in Iraq. But he’s destined now to be more famous as a literary figure.

No modern writer has been lampooned more. Hundreds if not thousands of man-hours have been spent teaching robots to produce automated Friedman-prose, in what collectively is a half-vicious, half-loving tribute to a man who raised bad writing to the level of an art form.

We will remember Friedman for interviewing 76 percent of the world’s taxi drivers, for predicting “the next six months will be critical” on 14 occasions over two and a half years (birthing the neologism, “the Friedman unit“), and for his unmatched, God-given ability to write nonsensical metaphors, like his classic “rule of holes”: “When you’re in one, stop digging. When you’re in three, bring a lot of shovels.”

Friedman’s great anti-gift is his ability to use many words when only a few are necessary. He became famous as a newspaper columnist for taking simple one-sentence observations like, “Wow, everyone has a cell phone these days,” and blowing them out into furious 850-word trash-fires of mismatched imagery and circular argument.

The double-axel version of this feat was to then rewrite that same column over and over again, in the same newspaper, only piling on more incongruous imagery and skewing rhetoric to further stoke that one thought into an even higher and angrier fire.

For nearly two decades now, Friedman has been telling us that something big is happening, technology is growing at a rate beyond the ability of humans to adapt (this is where the part about noticing everyone has a cell phone comes in), and that we have to stop doing things the old way and take a brave step into the future.

He wrote this column so many times that even four years ago – eight Friedman units – Hamilton Nolan wrote a piece in Gawker titled “Thomas Friedman writes his only column again” (Friedman’s “only column” has by now outlived hundreds of media outlets, Gawker and my own New York Press among them). Nolan cited a piece in the Times called “The Rise of Popularism,” in which Friedman argued, again, that technology was racing past humanity’s ability to govern itself wisely.

A very conservative guess is that Friedman has written this column at least a hundred times. Maybe 200. Maybe more. If you’re rolling your eyes at this, check yourself. Think about what an awesome accomplishment that is. It takes an extraordinary discipline to turn one sentence of thought into hundreds of thousands of words.

We all repeat ourselves in the punditry business. Most of us only have a few ideas. Friedman has fewer than most – it’s really just one, technology future derp! – but he’s attacked that one idea with such relentless evangelical energy that he is leaving behind as a monument to it the literary equivalent of the Giza pyramid complex.

This decades-long gigantic art project is based upon a vast architecture of needless complication, a process he describes in this new book of his, Thank You for Being Late, as “translating English into English.”

Build a sentence into a column; build a column into many columns; build many columns into a book; build one book into many books. Then start over!

Eleven years ago, when Friedman wrote his seminal explainer book, The World is Flat – a book whose title metaphor was hilariously based on the wrong premise that people are more interconnected on a flat earth than on a round one – he combined two giant sets of metaphors to describe that same idea that technology was outpacing our ability to govern ourselves.

He said rapid changes in the world were being fueled by 10 “flatteners” (things like the end of communism, Netscape, outsourcing, etc.) which in turn were amplified by he said were four “steroids”: Digital, Mobile, Personal and Virtual.

Those four steroids actually turned out to be six – changing or extending the terms of his imagery midstream is a classic Friedmanism – and the sixth “steroid,” new wireless devices, was actually a new group of steroids he called “uber-steroids.”

This was confusing because the tenth item in Friedman’s list of “flatteners” was the group of four steroids. So his last flattener was a new group of steroids and his last steroid was a new group of uber-steroids.

Which meant we had uber-steroids amplifying steroids amplifying flatteners, with each list comprising items that belonged to other lists. He mashed all of that together for 470 pages or so.

Eleven years and countless columns later, the new book Thank You for Being Late takes that same structure and boldly complicates it. This book is built, again, around the idea that technological change is advancing beyond our ability to adapt. The culprits this time are three great “Accelerations”: Moore’s Law (microchip processing power doubles every 18 to 24 months), the market (globalization) and Mother Nature, which is his English-language term for the English-language term, “climate change and biodiversity loss.”

These Three Accelerations in turn are transforming five key “realms,” which he lists as “the workplace, politics, geopolitics, ethics, and the community.”

If you’re wondering what’s left over when you subtract, from the subset of all things, “the workplace, politics, geopolitics, ethics, and the community,” you’re on to something. Because it turns out that the book is about how something is happening to – everything! “In short,” Friedman says, in the opening chapter of Late, “this book is one giant column about the world today.”

Incidentally, whenever Friedman uses the phrase, “In short…” he’s about to take the short form of an idea and make it longer, e.g. “In short, the only way for Mexico to thrive is with a strategy of reform retail that will enable it to beat China to the top, not the bottom, because China is not focused on beating Mexico as much as it is on beating America.”

To his credit, in Thank You for Being Late, Friedman debuts the use of, “To make a short story long,” which isn’t exactly fixing the problem. But it is funnier.

So how giant is this new giant column? Really giant. There aren’t enough drugs in the world to get anyone through Thank You for Being Late in one sitting.

Take the chapter about Mother Nature, which opens with a story about a day in July, 2015 when the heat index in southern Iran reached 163 degrees. That news item gives the author an opening to introduce the concept of a “black elephant,” an ominous (if you know Friedman) term apparently explained to him by environmentalist Adam Sweidan:

“[It is] a cross between a ‘black swan’ – a rare, low-probability, unanticipated event with enormous ramifications – and ‘the elephant in the room’: a problem that is widely visible to everyone, yet that no one wants to address, even though we absolutely know that one day it will have vast, black-swan-like consequences.”

You would think he could just say, “The climate change problem is a cross between a black swan and the elephant in the room – or, as I like to call it, a Black Elephant.”

Instead he leads audiences through drawn-out explanations of two everyday terms. Moreover his unnecessary definition of “the elephant in the room” contains the phrase “black swan,” making what was originally a relatively simple idea now a kind of circular movie-within-a-movie image that is more than a little hard to follow: “A black elephant is a cross between a black swan event and the elephant in the room, which is an ignored but visibly obvious problem that will inevitably become a black swan event.”

You’re still grappling with that when you learn “there are a herd of environmental black elephants out there.” Friedman names at least four: global warming, deforestation, ocean acidification and mass biodiversity extinction. He quotes Sweidan as saying of these: “When they hit, we’ll claim they were black swans that no one could have predicted, but in fact they were black elephants, very visible right now.”

Friedman just got finished telling us that a black elephant is half black swan, and half elephant in the room that will inevitably become a black swan. But now that half-swan, half swan-within-an-elephant is being contrasted with a black swan: in the near future, things that are really black elephants will be misidentified as black swans.

So that’s weird. While you’re sorting that out, Friedman tells you that the you that a 163-degree heat index in Iran is another black elephant, because “you can see it sitting in a room, you can feel it, and you can read about it in the newspaper.” He adds:

“Like any black elephant, you also know that it is so far outside the norm that it has all the characteristics of a black swan – that it is the harbinger of some very big, unpredictable changes in our climate system we may be unable to control.”

The next thing he says is that we spend tons of money preparing for the relatively unlikely event of nuclear war, but virtually nothing to prevent a very likely climate change catastrophe. He could have just led the chapter with that. But that would defeat the purpose of translating English into English.

You’re still wondering what happened to that elephant reading a newspaper about a black swan roasting in the desert when Friedman moves on to the next space-devouring exercise, telling us about the four phrases we need to master to learn “climate-speak.”

All four sound like the same idea and are immediately forgettable:

“Just a few years ago… but then something changed.”

“Wow, I’ve never seen that before.”

“Well, usually, but now I don’t know anymore.”

“We haven’t seen anything like that since.”

Quick, name any of those phrases you just read. You can’t! But you “have to master” all of them to grasp the rapidity of climate disturbances, which Friedman now describes as Mother Nature moving into the “second half of the chessboard.”

This is a reference to a metaphor from an earlier chapter recalling the ancient tale of the mathematician who asked a king for a reward. The master asked to have one grain of rice put on one corner of a chessboard, and then to have twice as many put on the next square, and to keep going, on and on to the end. The punchline is that after doubling down 64 times, you end up with 18 quintillion grains of rice or something – more than you’d have guessed!

Which is a metaphor for how much faster than we think is the pace of change all around us, be it in technology, economic displacement or, in this case, the environment. Did you know that “megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans” the last time the CO2 concentration in the earth’s atmosphere was as high as it was in Hawaii on May 3rd, 2013, an astonishing four hundred parts per million? You probably didn’t, because things that prowl usually have feet – but anyway, back to the elephants:

“And sometimes the records being broken as Mother Nature enters the second half of the chessboard are so numerous and profound, government agencies tracking them seem to run out of even climate-speak to describe the black elephants they are seeing.”

This must be that talent for “boiling things down” that Mr. Micklethwait talked about!

God bless this man. May he never stop writing books. Let’s grow this pie as big as we can.

331,"The coming Full Hunter’s Moon will grace our skies on October 24th, occurring in the sign of Taurus. While the moon may be occurring in arguably the most solid and stable zodiac sign, don’t underestimate the impact of planetary outside planetary energy. This is going to be a time of change and uncertainty, but you can find peace in the chaos.

The full moon is a time in which our emotions are at an all-time high, an intensity that can lead us to make impulsive or irrational decisions. Combined with the energy created by the location of the planets at the time, this is sure to create both great excitement and a frightening uncertainty. Are you prepared to weather this intense energy?

Prepare yourself for the coming Taurus Full Moon using this ritual:

You will need:

– A handful of flowers or leaves, either dried or fresh

#1 – You need to begin by cleansing your aura, ridding yourself of the negative energy that could disrupt your ritual. As you are smudging your aura using the smudging tool of choice, recite the following:

“I am cleansing myself, freeing myself from all negativity. I am cleansing myself of the struggles and challenges from my past. I am releasing my past mistakes and cleansing myself so that I can be my true self. I am cleansing and opening my heart. I am aligned with the Universe. My heart is now open.”

#2 – Shift your attention now from your aura to the space around you. As you smudge your surroundings, recite the following:

“I cleanse and purify this space with love, light, and truth. The only energy allowed to enter into this space will be positive energy. It is safe for me to be in this space. I call this space home, and my home is cleansed and free from negativity. It is safe for me to be here. I am renewed.”

#3 – Light your incense or oil burner, selecting a scent that brings you a feeling of calm and serenity.

#4 – Light your candle, placing it either next to you on the floor or nearby on the table if you are sitting up to a table.

#5 – Close your eyes and select a symbol, either a triangle, circle or heart. Don’t overthink this, trust your intuition and choose the first symbol that comes to mind. Taking your pen and paper, draw the symbol of choice on it.

#6 – Take your candle and place it on top of the symbol you just drew, doing your best to center it on the image. Using your leaves and/or flowers, create a visually appealing or ‘pretty’ display. Follow your heart, it will provide you with the direction of where to place everything.

#7 – Find a comfortable way of sitting close to your candle. If you are sitting up to a table, make sure that your feet are flat on the floor in order to ground yourself throughout the remainder of the ritual. In the same way, if you are seated on the floor, find a position that leaves you feeling ground and secure.

#8 – Place one hand over your heart, another on your belly. The exact location will be guided by your intuition. Close your eyes, taking 10 deep breaths. Shut out all outside distractions, focusing only on your breathing in the moment.

#9 – Take a single flower or leaf from alongside your candle, placing it in the palm of your hand. Looking closely at the item, recite the following three times: “I trust the energy of Mother Earth. She guides me as to what in my life I need to release.”

#10 – Ensuring that the flower or leaf remains in the palm of your hand, bring your hands together into a prayer position. Close your eyes, focusing on your breathing again until you feel completely calm, then repeat the mantra from the previous point.

#11 – Continue to hold onto your flower or leaf as you stand up and start to shake out your body. As you do so, visualize all the pain, anxiety, and hurt falling free from your life. Continue to shake until you feel as though all the negativity has been released, leaving you cleansed and pure.

#12 – Carefully sitting back down, hold up your leaf or flower and exhale onto it, releasing any remaining negative energy or anxiety into the object. Place the flower or leaf off to the side, ensuring that you know which it is. You need to properly dispose of this item in order to remove this negative energy from your life once and for all.

#13 – Pick up another flower or leaf, placing it in the palm of your hand just as you did the last. Looking closely at it, recite the following three times: “I trust the energy of Mother Earth. She both supports and nourishes my soul.”

#14 – Just as you did the last time, bring your hands into the prayer position with the flower or leaf between your palms. Close your eyes and take 10 deep, long breaths. With each of the first 9 breaths, visualize clean, pure energy coming into your body. On the 10th breath, open your eyes looking at the flower or leaf. Visualize beauty, happiness, support, and peace coming from the leaf or flower as you inhale, entering into your body and nourishing your soul.

#15 – Place the flower or leaf off to the side with the last one.

#16 – Look back to the candle, returning your hands to the prayer position. Recite the following:

“I call on my guardian angel and my spirit guides to help me to stay calm and embrace peace. I trust that the energy of Mother Earth is always working to guide me and protect me. I genuinely appreciate the way that Mother Earth is working in my life. I appreciate all the divine beings, spirits, and guardians that work to support me, encourage me and assist me on my life’s journey. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.”

#17 – This is the end of your ritual. Blow out the candle to finish. At this point, take the two leaves or flowers that you have set aside during the ritual and dispose of them appropriately. This can be done by releasing them from the top of a tall building or hill into the wind, throwing them into the ocean or burying them in a garden or wooded area.

You can choose to dispose of the alter you have created, or to leave it set up as a reminder of the peace that you have accepted into your life.",conspiracy,C029db,flat.earth
1041,"Spoiler alert: The Earth is not flat.

That said, the topic is certainly a fresh one for Twitter beef.

Scientists have recognized the curvature of the Earth for more than 2,000 years. But rapper B.o.B. challenged that view on Sunday when he began tweeting images and diagrams that he said were proof the Earth is as flat as a 45.

Did we mention B.o.B. is promoting a new album? Well he is. But he insists those things are definitely not related.

So far, B.o.B. -- nee Bobby Ray Simmons -- has posted almost 50 images of the supposedly flat planet, along with quotes from the 2014 book “The Flat Earth Conspiracy” by Eric Dubay.

Thousands of fans retweeted B.o.B.’s claims that “I’m going up against the greatest liars in history ... you’ve been tremendously deceived” and “I question the international laws that prevent you from exploring Antartica and the North Pole... what’s there to hide?”

Usually, when a prominent scientist steps forward to set the record straight, that’s the end of the conversation. But not for B.o.B. He tweeted a song he’d written, “Flatline,” in which he insists “Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest” and ponders why NASA is part of the Department of Defense. (Actually, it’s not.)

Then, in a move B.o.B. probably didn’t see coming, Tyson dropped a diss track back at him.

The rapper Tyson was referring to was his nephew, Steve Tyson, who goes by “Tyson.” He wrote and recorded the song “Flat to Fact.”

In an interview with The Times, Tyson the rapper said he came up with the idea of writing a song in his famous uncle’s defense after texting with him Tuesday morning

“I recorded it in my living room,” Tyson said. “I wrote it in a couple hours and just hit record and started recording it as a track.” His uncle recorded himself reading some of his tweets to use in the song.

Not everyone was persuaded. Many followers s eemed eager to jump on the flat Earth bandwagon B.o.B. was all too eager to retweet them.

Perhaps Laura Danly will be more convincing. the curator of the Griffith Observatory, kindly agreed to address a few of B.o.B. including why you can’t see the curvature of the Earth.

“The Earth is just big,” she said. “You look out to the horizon and it looks flat. But if you get into space you can see the curvature.”

B.o.B. asserts that we have no photos of a curved Earth that weren’t “taken” by NASA. That’s not true either: the Earth, including China in 2014 and Japan just last year.

Other things that prove the Earth is round: The fact that we can observe sunrises and sunsets. The fact that people in different hemispheres see different constellations. The fact that you can fly around it in a straight line.

So for the record, the Earth: definitely round.

965,"Detail from Nicolaes Visscher, Novissima et Accuratissima Totius Americae Descriptio, c . 1658 (plate 1).

Over the course of the early modern period, the ‘space’ of the Netherlands opened up in several productive ways. Perhaps most famously, the Dutch created the new space of the Republic: viable political space, demarcated from an older collection of provinces, which had been gathered most recently under the auspices of the king of Spain. The Dutch also expended tremendous effort reconstituting the physical space of the Low Countries: land reclaimed from water and increased urban centres, which allowed the Republic to grow in population and gain in arable terrain. And the Dutch enlarged their commercial and colonial space by dint of their numerous overseas expansions: a ‘New’ Netherland (almost always referred to in singular form), which arose on the eastern shores of what was already then called North America; a modern ‘Batavia’, which emerged in present‐day Indonesia; and a host of Dutch forts and settlements that otherwise dotted the coasts and islands of Asia, Africa and the Americas. The Dutch also developed, just as famously, new pictorial devices to engage with space – the painterly and printerly techniques explored in this issue – and, not unrelated, new techniques to map spaces: the most robust cartographic ateliers of early modern Europe, which developed first in Antwerp and then in Amsterdam from the late sixteenth century, coincident with the rise of the Dutch Republic and the Golden Age of Dutch visual culture. Maps proliferated in the early modern Netherlands. They offered a means both to delineate space and to narrate space – to explicate how space works and to assert where their makers (and consumers) fit within these spaces. Yet maps were also important and ubiquitous material objects in the Netherlands, which occupied myriad additional spaces and which played with the many spatial and material concerns of their viewers. They engaged viewers and enticed them into their interpretive spaces.

How do Dutch maps work, and what does this reveal about the visual culture of the early modern Netherlands? These questions were famously tackled by Svetlana Alpers in The Art of Describing mostly in regard to landscape painting. Yet in many ways, her influential essay on ‘The Mapping Impulse in Dutch Art’ – the go‐to source for non‐Dutch specialists, particularly historians of science who seek to affiliate their concerns with habits of natural‐history representation with a broadly northern European tradition of painting – curiously avoided the key to this intriguing interpretive palace: the maps themselves and how they actually function.1 While Alpers’ oft‐cited chapter does open with Vermeer's Allegory of Painting and the impressive wall map by Claes Jansz. Visscher that amply fills its background, maps are otherwise relegated to the side, treated sparingly and elliptically at best – at least the form of artfully designed, lavishly embellished and meticulously printed maps that enjoyed such phenomenal popularity in the Netherlands from the late sixteenth through at least the early eighteenth century.

Maps do matter, and, as Alpers astutely points out, cartographic materials played a significant and instructive role in the visual, social and indeed the political culture of the early modern Dutch Republic. They were ubiquitous in more ways than one: as décor in houses and paintings; as devices of learning and social standing; as media of cultural and political messaging. In a vital sense, however, these roles remain conspicuously absent in her analysis, inadequately problematized and not at all ‘deconstructed’ – to invoke the language of the new critical cartography that was being developed precisely when Alpers was formulating her insights into Dutch visual culture.2 Maps as productive sources (as opposed to theorized ‘impulses’) are only lightly glossed in Alpers’ essay, their most superficial features brought to bear on a, by contrast, highly sophisticated argument about forms of ‘mapped’ landscapes (as she terms it), best exemplified by the flat panoramic paintings of Philips Koninck. This inverted theoretical focus distorts our perspective of Dutch (and other) maps and relegates to the periphery an enormously dynamic visual source in the early modern Netherlands. It also irons out – unnecessarily – the stimulating complexities of cartographic sources and the promising possibilities of Alpers’ implied query: what do maps offer to scholars of Dutch visual culture? Rather than a ‘flat working surface’, a Dutch map of this period was typically dense and jagged, presenting the viewer with multiple angles of interpretive entry, as the essays of this issue show for other media and genres. Rather than offering a ‘detached or perhaps even … culturally unbiased view’ – can such a source ever be possible? – these profusely layered artefacts furnish critical insight into and material evidence of the visual culture that Alpers aims to address.3 Early modern maps are delightfully thick objects and fundamentally material things. They illustrate modes of representation and craft, and they encourage various points of vision and interpretation. As it turns out, maps are anything but ‘flat’. They richly demonstrate, in their own way, the ‘picturing impulse’ of early modern Dutch culture.

This brief intervention aims not so much to argue with Alpers as to consider a part of her argument that was left relatively under‐scrutinized: the workings of Dutch maps. My goal is less to analyse how these maps work – there is a vast and expanding literature that does just that4 – or even how they work in the context of early modern Dutch painting, but rather to explore the qualities of cartographic design that might speak to the thematics of seeing and sensing pictures, so that they might contribute, in this way, to the broader understanding of Dutch visual culture that this issue sets out to explore. Maps are indubitably thick: they gesture relentlessly toward their materiality and to the challenge their makers face in rendering into two dimensions what begins as three – the same challenge confronted by Dutch painters, as several of the essays gathered here so elegantly argue. Maps are theatrical: they stage global space in a profusely embellished form – they rarely offer mere, austere ‘description’ – and they dramatize for their viewers ways of processing both the lands and waters of the world and the things and events that occur within them. And – as this might imply – maps are narrational: they narrate spaces, frame histories and posit polemics – much like Baroque theatre, to be sure, yet also like genres of painting of the period, both in the Netherlands and elsewhere.

To demonstrate a few of these qualities, I turn, naturally, to a map: Nicolaes Visscher's immensely popular Novissima et Accuratissima Totius Americae Descriptio (first edition c . 1658; plate 1), published more or less contemporaneously with Vermeer's Allegory of Painting (c . 1666–68). Visscher's printed map has an impressive history, going backward and forward, and touching as well the key cartographic source of Alpers’ inquiry.5 Its original author was the only son of Claes Jansz. Visscher, the well‐regarded cartographer who engraved the wall map depicted in the Vermeer Allegory . The Visscher family also had ties by marriage to the illustrious Hondius firm, makers of the Mercator atlases through the first half of the seventeenth century – they were thus kinsmen of mapping aristocracy – and their atelier in Amsterdam on the Kalverstraat placed them in the thick of all things cartographic. The younger Visscher followed in his father's professional footsteps and enjoyed considerable success, especially with his map of the Americas. The Americae went through several editions, also in revised forms engraved by other (sometimes competing) ateliers; it was appropriated for geography books, both as an insert and (in a distilled form) as a frontispiece; and it was routinely copied and pirated outright, extending its successful run well into the eighteenth century.6 It became perhaps the single most important early modern map of the western hemisphere and certainly one of the most recognized images of the New World. Its allegorical (lower) cartouche, moreover, became the all‐but standard representation of ‘America’, an iconic image that crossed easily into other genres and media.

Nevertheless, despite its prestigious lineage and its titular promises of ‘novelty’ and ‘accuracy’, the map succeeded not so much for its exacting ‘description’ as for other, arguably pictorial reasons: for its highly embellished and appealing presentation of the New World. The actual cartographic content of the map – the particular delineations of the lands and seas of the western hemisphere – was scarcely new. It derived mostly from older materials, chiefly Joan Blaeu's 1648 map of the world; the outlines of the continents of these two maps are nearly identical. This habit of replication was not at all uncommon in early modern Dutch cartography (as in other graphic arts), especially in the sort of lavishly ornamented charts that became the mainstay of Amsterdam ateliers. Nor can the Visscher map make great claims for geographic meticulousness: a prominent ‘California’ floats off the western coast of America, an island of the mapmakers’ imagination; the Great Lakes blend into one truly great lake, which leaks its contents into the Atlantic; and the long‐sought Northwest Passage is offered optimistically as readily accessible, an open sea flowing freely into Asia. The map's promise of novelty and accuracy, in other words, is rhetoric – again, a fairly common ploy in early modern mapping (as in late modern advertising). No Baconian empiricism here, but rather strategies that relate to the techniques of rhetoric – pervasive across myriad Renaissance fields of enquiry – and to the crafty practices of the workshop.

What likely sold the map, more than its less‐than‐meticulous ‘description’ of the continents, would have been the staging of the Americae and the ample ‘adornments’ that enriched Visscher's product: the four‐legged staffage that wander the open, ultimately uncharted spaces of the map (what J. B. Harley famously called its ‘silences’); the ethnographic vignettes that explicate the New World's indigenes; and, not least, the superb cartouches that fill the upper and lower divisions of the vast Pacific Ocean, at once distilling and framing the continents in terms of space and narrative.7 The charming ‘creatures in the map’ – these did not go out of style in the Renaissance – would have appealed to a range of consumers.8 Two handsome stag deer saunter across the terrain of Eastern Canada (Nova Francia on the map); they would appear to await the hunter's arrow just as do the tame deer of Ben Johnson's poetic Penshurst or any other exemplary country house. A fox gambols across the Great Plains (a scene likewise redolent of the Northern European countryside); and beavers, coveted lately by Dutch merchants for their valuable pelts, pose obediently just inland of the plainly demarcated empire of Nieu [New] Nederland .9 Further afield a pair of brown bears inhabit the open, wild west; meanwhile, a lone anteater has South America largely to himself. The two‐legged staffage of tropical America – that is, the indigenous Americans – do no hunt any exotic fauna, but one another. Their depiction in the interior of Brazil, naked and engrossed in brutal warfare, offers a synoptic view of the ‘savage’ Indian, here imagined as uncivilized if also unobtrusive.

As for the pair of cartouches, one occupying the upper left and the other the lower left portion of Visscher's print, these serve as the dual anchors of the map, the dominant pictorial elements and the keys to the artefact's interpretation (plate 2 and plate 3). They also function to stage the map's motifs and – crucially – to elucidate its overall message. It is here that both the theatrical and narrative impulses of Dutch mapping come through most vividly and most pictorially. Both cartouches follow designs by Nicolaes Pietersz. Berchem, a highly regarded landscape painter, as it turns out (and the only son of Pieter Claesz, a master of still‐life painting), who specialized in a form of idealized Italianate scenes popular in that period (a subgenre of Dutch landscape that lay conspicuously beyond Alpers’ scrutiny as putatively un‐Dutch).10 The pair of map vignettes work as an ensemble – the device of the parasol lures the viewer's eye from the vignette below to the balancing scene above – yet it is the iconic figure of America herself, who gracefully gestures to the map's ‘carved’ title, that lies at the heart of the visual programme. Berchem at once allegorized and condensed the essential qualities of the cartographic space. He packed it all in: the alluring personification of ‘America’, decked out in a dainty feathered skirt and colourful feathered headdress; the pearls, barely visible around her neck, demonstrating the region's endemic richness; the classic bow and arrow, just to her right, alluding to her habit of hunting (America also bears a stylized club); the mounds of freshly mined gold (or perhaps silver) piling up at her feet, alongside stacks of ingots that indicate the substantial mineral wealth of the continent; a pair of queerly coiled snakes, which reveal the exotic naturalia of the New World; and the central parasol, which shades America's head from the tropical sun.11 The sum of the parts tells the story of the whole: a massively rich, vaguely exotic, not‐quite‐tamed New World.

The upper cartouche furnishes another allegory, which introduces a different angle on America, yet one that is thematically complementary. A cluster of figures surrounds and supports a free‐floating, shield‐like device, which bears a patron's coat of arms and the map's dedication (to Cornelius Witsen, a major supporter of overseas trade and exploration, on the original state, yet this varies with different printings).12 The predominant figure of this cluster, a European woman hovering in the very upper‐left corner of the map, represents Christian Faith: relatively plainly dressed, she points didactically with one hand to a cross that she holds in her other hand and positions directly above the other figures. She glances not to the cross, however, but to a broad‐shouldered, sharp‐taloned, demon‐like figure below, who tumbles out of the sky: an allegory of diabolism, ejected by the Christian Church. An angel opposite and above gazes, mouth agape, at this falling devil and the wondrous turn of events, while another heavenly figure, just to the angel's left, announces per clarion the plunge of diabolism and the spread of the gospel. Finally, an Indian – the figure situated closest to the American landmass who wears the same feathered headdress as the principal ‘American’ figure of the lower cartouche, in this way linking the two vignettes – gazes in astonishment at the allegory of Faith, whose good works have apparently converted him. The cartouche recounts, in short, the Church's labours in the New World: its presumed successes casting out false faiths and diabolisms, and evangelizing among the American indigenes.13

To say that these vignettes are staged is to identify both the drama of Faith's triumphs in the New World and the several marks of theatricality that hold the ensemble together. The parasol does this formally: not only does it lure the eye upward, but it points directly to the upper Indian; were he to fall from the sky, he might pierce himself on the parasol's tasselled spike. The parasol functions, further, as a clever stage prop, a showy accoutrement that establishes the ostentatious tropicality of America (the point of the parasol abuts the very words ‘Tropicus Capricorni ’). In fact, bona fide parasols commonly served as props in Baroque theatre; and a particularly famous example of this, the engraving of Anne Bracegirdle in her popular role as ‘The Indian Queen’, alludes subtly to the Berchem allegory of America: feathers, pearls and parasol render the renowned Restoration actress adequately ‘exotic’.14 Theatrical motions – of hands and other limbs – also lend the joint cartouches a dramatic, balletic cogency: arms akimbo on either side of the title slab, hands gesturing instructively by the allegorical figures both above and below, and the scissoring feet of Christian Faith and her Indian protégé alike all serve to animate the scene. The swirling dress of Faith, swept up by the heavenly winds, and her billowing and entirely theatrical shawl (since this prop would have been utterly extraneous in the heavens) suggest, yet again, tricks of the stage – and, of course, of highly painterly composition. All of these devices heighten the drama of the map and thereby elucidate the meaning of America.

And all of these devices might also prompt the question: what is the message of the map and the narrative arch that bridges Berchem's upper and lower cartouches? The bond between Faith and America harks back to a proverbial wisdom that circulated in late medieval and early modern Europe about the inverse relation of ‘god’ and ‘gold’: wherever the latter flowed abundantly, it was proposed, the former was typically scarce (and the reverse). Such a conception of America and her endemic riches‐cum‐heathenism justified much of Habsburg Spain's early colonial action in the New World – the conquest and simultaneous conversion of the Indians. Yet it also carried an implicit moral message, which gained traction among critics of the Habsburg Conquista , especially in Northern Europe. And here we need to turn to a text, one of many that would have helped viewers read Visscher's map. A late sixteenth‐century poem, which captioned the Dutch and German editions of an engraved allegory of America, commented poignantly on this contradictory relationship between the European god and American gold (words that punned even more in the original: god and goud in Dutch):

Here the wondrous mineral wealth of America fosters her own decline; she goes from benighted idolatry to miserable slavery. The sixteenth‐century allegory (engraved by Adriaen Collaert after a design by Maarten de Vos) expresses sympathy for the doubly abused Indians. In the Visscher map, however, with its relatively neutral‐looking figure of Faith, not obviously Catholic nor Protestant, and with its pan‐colonial vision of the Americas – New France, New Netherlands, and English‐settled Virginia are all engraved into the space, no less than the nomenclature of Iberian colonial possessions in South America – the message pertains to European colonialism and European exoticism writ large. The map spells out the evangelical and imperial rise of the Old World in the New.

A map, however, even while it may possess plentiful text and even while it might be read as and with the help of text, is certainly not identical to text – it is textual and pictorial, not to mention cartographical. It is also material, of course, and while there may have been textual and iconographic foundations for such maps as Visscher's, there were also unmistakable evocations of craft and materiality. The heritage of early modern Dutch cartography goes back not so much to Ptolemy, as Alpers argues, as to the pioneering labours of Gerard Mercator and Abraham Ortelius, who drew on the traditions of late‐medieval mapping – highly pictorial and allegorical products, typically emanating from the workshops of master illuminators – and on the world of craft.16 Ortelius instinctively placed geography in the context of art: famously in relationship to history (‘Historiae oculus geographia ’), yet also in the sphere of drama.17 His Theatrum orbis terrarrum not only summons the language of the stage, but also greets its audience on its engraved title page with a recognizable proscenium (plate 4). Mercator – whose posthumously published atlas also adapted the symbols of theatre on its title page – sprang more directly from the milieu of craft. His main source of income in his early professional years came from the fabrication of mathematical and navigational instruments – this placed him in the vibrant, metal‐working ateliers of northern Europe – and, for many of the early cartographic projects with which we associate him (his work with Gemma Frisius and Gaspar à Myrica, for example, on their terrestrial globe), he served as a highly skilled engraver of brass plates. He was also an innovator in the production of commercial globes; and he was a remarkable italicist, who composed, designed and printed the first instruction book of italic script published north of the Alps. He mastered math and craft, art and ‘science’.

More to the point, the actual, tangible maps of Mercator and Ortelius go out of their way in these early years to emphasize their affiliation with modes of craft and material arts. Both mapmakers’ ateliers, in producing the first generation of ‘craft maps’ – this is the geographer John Pickles’ term for the highly pictorial, thickly ornamented maps that developed in the late sixteenth‐century Netherlands18 – make habitual reference to the process of their maps’ production and to the material arts whence they came. Thus does Mercator's Orbis Terrae Compendiosa Descriptio make literal reference to its maker's background in brass‐work by the depiction of an armillary sphere in the upper centre of the map's design, while also making more figurative allusions to metalwork in the strapwork surrounding the armillary; in the elaborate fretwork bearing the global hemispheres; and in the clever metallic tooling of the engraved frame that encases the world map (plate 5). These devices serve to emphasize the ‘thickness’ of early modern cartography – its broader project of converting three‐dimensional space into two – while also invoking the material arts with which Mercator (and many map illuminators before him) sought to affiliate himself. Thus, too, does Ortelius offer one of his most celebrated cartographic images – Abrahami Patriarchae Peregrinatio et Vita (1590), which charts the life and journeys of the Old Testament patriarch Abraham, the mapmaker's namesake – as a trompe l'oeil that invokes the illustrious art of tapestry (plate 6). Meanwhile, several other graphic techniques make more subtle gestures to various other material arts: twenty‐two circular medallion vignettes, so‐called since they evoke the bronze medallions much in fashion at that time, do the heavy‐lifting narration of Abraham's life; two superb cartouches display the map's textual apparatus and once again reference the art of strapwork (the interior sample with garlands being a particularly fine example of the genre); and two decorative masks – ‘hung’ on a strapwork cartouche, which is ‘fastened’ to a cartographic tapestry – not only lend a sense of depth to this already densely materialized map, but also allude to the world of theatre. The map, in short, offers a tour de force of spatial manipulation – to go along with its textual and pictorial narration.

Some three‐quarters of a century later, Nicolaes Visscher and Nicolaes Berchem likewise expended considerable effort in thickening their map. They collaboratively layered several illusions of space in the Americae engraving. Careful hatching around the edges of the continents and scattered islands lends a sense of depth to the hemisphere, a quality further enhanced by the ‘shadows’ cast by the ships at sea and the animals on shore (see plate 1). This imparts to what otherwise might be perceived as flat geographic space the property of density, and it grants the map's viewers an optical sense of verticality, as if they were observing the continents from an elevated, almost atmospheric altitude. The swirling figures of the upper vignette induce a dizzying lateral movement yet further up; we are now in the skies, if not quite the heavens, where shadow and wind still persist (see plate 3). The curling (upper) cartouche, which carries the map's dedication on the form of a wooden shield, also plays with the materiality of that shield: a shield bears a shield, as it were. In the lower vignette, space moves more horizontally. Here there is a quality of earthiness, as opposed to the lofty airiness above, and the conceit that the ground slopes downward along with the figures behind the ‘slab’ of cartouche who recede gently into the horizon (and presumably further into the subterranean mines from where America's gold and silver originate) (see plate 2). And if wind animates the upper scene, the sun plays that role below, casting shadows over the figure of America, thereby also accentuating the tropical heat of the land. The parasol, that most tangible of accessories of the tropics and theatre alike, stylishly shields ‘America’ from the elements, and in this way also pulls the narrative spaces together.

Craft maps, a genre developed outstandingly in the picture‐rich culture of the early modern Netherlands, drew from the arts of painting and engraving, and from the fields of geography and the material arts. Their form owed much to the practices of ateliers: to printerly habits of delineating and ‘describing’, to be sure, yet also to modes of narrating and embellishing space, of crafting and thickening maps. Indeed, within the intricate matrix of early modern Dutch workshops, the makers of maps borrowed as well as loaned; images from cartographic sources and geography books moved from printed media (textual as well as iconographic), yet also to material arts. ‘America’ would redeploy over the coming decades from maps to forms of tapestry, ceramic (especially porcelain, once Europe mastered its own techniques of production), lacquer‐ware, cut glass, and so on, as the image steadily gained in popularity. Visscher's cartographic images, in other words, moved from the two‐dimensional space of the map back to the three‐dimensional space of the decorative arts from where Mercator and Ortelius had drawn their earlier inspiration.

Both the lineage and the influence of ‘craft’ maps are rich in numerous ways. Early modern Dutch maps are anything but mere ‘description’, and they most certainly illustrate, pace Alpers, abundant ‘pictorial marks of [social and political] authority’.19 They illustrate and narrate and dramatize much more, and much that speaks rather productively to Alpers’ and our concerns with Dutch visual culture. For maps such as those produced by Visscher and his contemporaries ask us – just as other prints and paintings do – to think about space and its representation. Dutch maps use graphic forms and pictorial devices to stage space and to present the drama of space from multiple angles and perspectives. Visscher's map, complemented by Berchem's vignettes, displays the drama of European expansion from up high and down low, from the fauna‐rich interiors of the American continents to the ship‐peppered seas that surround them. It invokes the tricks of theatre – rhetoric and gesture, evocation and insinuation, props and propaganda – to narrate space, in this case the spaces of European conquest, colonialism and empire. And it narrates that space in assorted ways, just as history narrates and as other textual and pictorial genres narrate: to be the eye of history is not necessarily to be wholly mute (or purely descriptive). It does all this, again as other visual sources do, as a means to entice its viewers. The Americae beckon in myriad ways: Berchem's figure of ‘America’ seduces its viewer with her opulent pearls and exotic feathers, tactile prompts of supreme allure; Visscher's sheet map invokes multiple registers of materiality, encouraging an intense sense of touch, depth and space; and the Americae , of course, arouse wide‐ranging colonial desires, which surely reached across to several early modern European aspirants of imperial worlds. Early modern Dutch maps, in these many ways, surely exhibit the shared impulses of painting and cartography, yet this does not so much demonstrate a flattened mapping impulse in Dutch art as it reveals the rich, thick, pictorial impulses in Dutch maps.",mainstream,M0b501,flat.earth

This is not a joke, at least, it doesn't appear to be one.

I'm not sure why the thousands of other satellites and images from those satellites aren't good enough. But sometimes, you've just got to do it yourself.

A large proportion of flat-Earthers believe the Earth is a disk with sort of dome over it containing our atmosphere. Above that, the Sun, stars, and moon all do a dance above the disc-shaped Earth.

B.o.B has tweeted several times that because objects in the far-off horizon don't appear to curve, the Earth must be flat.

The above tweet garnered the attention of Neil DeGrasse Tyson, famed astrophysicist. He points out that, yes, the Earth has obscured 150 feet of Manhattan but since most buildings are much taller than that, you can still see Manhattan's skyscrapers from 16 miles away.

The flat Earth belief has grown in popularity recently as a result of high-profile celebrities and athletes supporting the belief the Earth is flat. This includes Kyrie Irving, Sammy Watkins, and Tila Tequila who have all expressed belief in a flat Earth.

The GoFundMe campaign plans to launch multiple satellites into space, which will allow the rapper to observe and disprove the widely held belief that the Earth is not flat. He's looking for just $1 million, a small price tag to completely upend one of the most basic understandings of our solar system.

As you may know, he's referring to the fact that Kyrie Irving has repeatedly questioned if the Earth is round, although he once said he was trolling and then went back and explained his beliefs.

So, there are two explanations about that tweet:

1. Irving and Ainge have held extensive discussions about their respective beliefs about the shape of the Earth and the guard convinced the exec that the Earth is indeed flat. Ainge decided to share his discovery with the world late on a Monday night.

2. Ainge had just finished watching Irving drop 47 points on the Dallas Mavericks in the Celtics' 16th straight win, and he's so tickled by Irving's performance this year that Ainge basically joked something like this: ""Hey, I'll believe whatever you want me to believe, Kyrie, as long as you keep playing like that.""

887,"The Great Pyramid is a true masterpiece and has rightly earned the title of a “Wonder”. It was built with such precision that our current technology cannot replicate it.

Historical analysis shows that the Pyramids were built between 2589 and 2504 BC.

There are so many interesting facts about this Pyramid that it baffles archaeologists, scientists, astronomers and tourists.

Here are the facts:



01. The pyramid is estimated to have around 2,300,000 stone blocks that weigh from 2 to 30 tons each and there are even some blocks that weigh over 50 tons.

02. The Pyramid of Menkaure, the Pyramid of Khafre and the Great Pyramid of Khufu are precisely aligned with the Constellation of Orion.

03. The base of the pyramid covers 55,000 m2 (592,000 ft 2) with each side greater than 20,000 m2 (218,000 ft2) in area.

04. The interior temperature is constant and equals the average temperature of the earth, 20 Degrees Celsius (68 Degrees Fahrenheit).

05. The outer mantle was composed of 144,000 casing stones, all of them highly polished and flat to an accuracy of 1/100th of an inch, about 100 inches thick and weighing approx. 15 tons each.

06. The cornerstone foundations of the pyramid have ball and socket construction capable of dealing with heat expansion and earthquakes.

07. The mortar used is of an unknown origin (Yes, no explanation given). It has been analyzed and its chemical composition is known but it can’t be reproduced. It is stronger than the stone and still holding up today.

08. It was originally covered with casing stones (made of highly polished limestone). These casing stones reflected the sun’s light and made the pyramid shine like a jewel. They are no longer present being used by Arabs to build mosques after an earthquake in the 14th century loosened many of them.

It has been calculated that the original pyramid with its casing stones would act like gigantic mirrors and reflect light so powerful that it would be visible from the moon as a shining star on earth. Appropriately, the ancient Egyptians called the Great Pyramid “Ikhet”, meaning the “Glorious Light”.

How these blocks were transported and assembled into the pyramid is still a mystery. – http://www.gizapyramid.com/general.htm

09. Aligned True North: The Great Pyramid is the most accurately aligned structure in existence and faces true north with only 3/60th of a degree of error. The position of the North Pole moves over time and the pyramid was exactly aligned at one time.

10. Center of Land Mass: The Great Pyramid is located at the center of the land mass of the earth. The east/west parallel that crosses the most land and the north/south meridian that crosses the most land intersect in two places on the earth, one in the ocean and the other at the Great Pyramid.

11. The four faces of the pyramid are slightly concave, the only pyramid to have been built this way.

12. The centers of the four sides are indented with an extraordinary degree of precision forming the only 8 sided pyramid, this effect is not visible from the ground or from a distance but only from the air, and then only under the proper lighting conditions.

This phenomenon is only detectable from the air at dawn and sunset on the spring and autumn equinoxes, when the sun casts shadows on the pyramid.

13. The granite coffer in the “King’s Chamber” is too big to fit through the passages and so it must have been put in place during construction.

14. The coffer was made out of a block of solid granite. This would have required bronze saws 8-9 ft. long set with teeth of sapphires. Hollowing out of the interior would require tubular drills of the same material applied with a tremendous vertical force.

15. Microscopic analysis of the coffer reveals that it was made with a fixed point drill that used hard jewel bits and a drilling force of 2 tons.

16. The Great Pyramid had a swivel door entrance at one time. Swivel doors were found in only two other pyramids: Khufu’s father and grandfather, Sneferu and Huni, respectively.

17. It is reported that when the pyramid was first broken into that the swivel door, weighing some 20 tons, was so well balanced that it could be opened by pushing out from the inside with only minimal force, but when closed, was so perfect a fit that it could scarcely be detected and there was not enough crack or crevice around the edges to gain a grasp from the outside.

18. With the mantle in place, the Great Pyramid could be seen from the mountains in Israel and probably the moon as well.

19. The weight of the pyramid is estimated at 5,955,000 tons. Multiplied by 10^8 gives a reasonable estimate of the earth’s mass.

20. The Descending Passage pointed to the pole star Alpha Draconis, circa 2170-2144 BCE. This was the North Star at that point in time. No other star has aligned with the passage since then.

21. The southern shaft in the King’s Chamber pointed to the star Al Nitak (Zeta Orionis) in the constellation Orion, circa 2450 BCE The Orion constellation was associated with the Egyptian god Osiris. No other star aligned with this shaft during that time in history.

22. Sun’s Radius: Twice the perimeter of the bottom of the granite coffer times 10^8 is the sun’s mean radius. [270.45378502 Pyramid Inches* 10^8 = 427,316 miles]

23. The curvature designed into the faces of the pyramid exactly matches the radius of the earth.

24. Khufu’s pyramid, known as the great pyramid of Giza, is the oldest and largest, rising at 481 feet (146 meters). Archaeologists say it was the tallest structure in the world for about 3, 800 years.

25. The relationship between Pi (p) and Phi (F) is expressed in the fundamental proportions of the Great Pyramid.

351,"As far as failed predictions go, this one may be the original. Everyone knows the world is round, right? Not so. Homer thought it was flat. Ancient Buddhist cosmology agreed that earth was like a horizontal disk. Hebrew Scriptures suggested it might resemble a dome. Some in ancient China claimed it to be a square. And when Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492, many Europeans thought he might reach its edge. Some scholars suggest that a round-earth theory had more early support than one might think. Echoes of a round-earth cosmology can be heard in Plato, and 6th century B.C. Greek philosopher Pythagoras (yep, same a² + b² = c² guy) is said to have agreed. Around the time of Christ, an Asian belief held that the earth was like the yolk in an egg, and Muslim scholars supported a round earth by the 9th century. The Western world joined the round-earth campaign a little late, when Magellan's 1519 global voyage seemed to confirm the round hypothesis. Yet, as is the case with many strange predictions, a handful of believers like the Flat Earth Society still hold fast to their convictions. The rest of us would say however, they are, um, flat-out wrong.

261,"Browsing through history, it’s very clear that the world has undergone many monumental shifts in society that have uprooted it’s very foundation in place of new seed.

A paradigm shift is a fundamental change in approach or underlining assumptions. For example, when Pythagoras proposed that the Earth was round instead of flat, the foundation of science and people’s understanding of the world was completely changed. Similarly, when the Industrial Revolution took place there was a complete shift in manufacturing, lifestyle, and economics.

A paradigm shift can literally shake a society to its core, taking it off its current path and putting it on a brand new one. Though it might appear the opposite in the corporate controlled mainstream news, it appears that the entire world is in the very early stages of a paradigm shift. These shifts take place in many of the worlds most basic elements and redefine how life functions.

Here are 8 signs the world is undergoing a paradigm shift:

1. The Power of the Internet and the Age of Information

The Internet is arguably the greatest invention in the history of man. Never in our known history has man had access to such a broad range of diverse information from all over the world at the tips of his fingers. Many forget that the Internet has only really been commercialized in the west since the early 1990’s and its spread across the world hasn’t even come close to peaking yet. The Internet is undoubtedly giving rise to the Age of Information as people become more awake to what’s really going on in the world.

A multitude of information is now accessible if one knows where to look. People can now learn new skills or hear different versions of the truth in mere minutes. The Internet is not only giving rise to an open access of information, but communication is almost instantaneous all over the world. It is paramount that the Internet remain an open decentralized system in which everyone can freely add and operate if this paradigm shift is to continue. It feeds almost all other shifts.



2. The Ascent Of the Independent Non-Corporate Online Media

Thanks solely to the Internet, the rise in independent journalism has taken off. Alternative media has become an increasingly popular choice for those wishing to stay truly informed, especially younger generations. People are continually switching off cable news (cable TV all together), and instead resorting to online sources. While mainstream news is still the number one source of current world events for the masses, the tide is slowly changing as people are awakening to the fact that corporate sponsored media is mostly propaganda and half-truths.

War is becoming much harder to justify as independent journalists have shined the light on what the powers that be never wanted anyone to see. A prime example is the conflict in Syria in which the establishment, despite the lack of popular support, so desperately wanted to start a war that when the rebels they were funding used chemical weapons, it was then blamed on the Assad government to protect their investment and design. Thanks to independent journalists, a war has so far been averted since it was revealed that the U.S. was in bed with the rebel groups and it was the rebels who used the chemical weapons. This new faction of journalism will give peace a legitimate chance as all dirty laundry is now being aired and corrupt alliances exposed. This in turn has allowed many people to deprogram from the countless media they have taken in over the years and see the world through a clearer lens in which the truth is more evident.

Though it will never be broadcast on mainstream news, the real threat of a U.S. dollar collapse as the world reserve currency is very real. The paradigm of central bank controlled economies that can issue credit and zero percent interest rates through nearly unlimited printing of money backed by nothing is an illusion that is beginning to break down. It’s not just the U.S. dollar that’s under threat, but many other central currencies such as the Euro and Yen. Massive equity bubbles are being blown up by this cheap credit along with massive debt that will be nearly impossible to pay back with the current economies in which only the very elite benefit.

Many countries are waking up to the fact that, like all other bubbles, these bubbles will burst and they are beginning to break away from the dollar. Examples include the buildup of a new central bank in the emerging economy of the BRICS group, the countless countries passing trade agreements in which bypassing the U.S. dollar (including agreements in oil), and the persistent selling of treasury stocks by the Chinese government who quite often are the last resort buyer of U.S. debt. Not only has there been a shift in the pecking order of fiat paper currencies, but decentralized crypto-currencies like Bitcoin are threatening the very system of fiat money and the centralized control a select few elite have on that system through central banks. This would shift power worldwide.



4. The Rise of the Peer-to-Peer Economy

A Peer-to-Peer (P20) Economy is a de-centralized model whereby two individuals interact to buy or sell goods and services directly with each other, without intermediation by a third-party, or without the use of a company or business. We see this being used by companies like Air BnB, Uber, Craigslist, Sidecar, and Dogvacay among others. Often referred to as a sharing economy, there is no centralized control of power, allowing people to more directly profit from their goods/services rather than pay unnecessary middlemen along the way.

This is a trend that is sure to grow as technology makes it easier for people to make it on their own and allows for people to own their means of production and finished goods, instead of just being paid in the production process. The peer-to-peer economy is also possible through the abundance of goods already out there, allowing for goods to be shared and recycled rather than thrown away and reproduced. Not only is the peer-to-peer economy growing, but many young people are ditching the career 9-5 jobs and branching off into independent careers or job hopping. The top down business model in economics has now found a legitimate system in which a decentralized bottom up approach gives the power back to the people.

The shift towards renewable energy is a forgone conclusion as renewable energy is the way of the future. In fact, the shift looks to be happening faster than people realize. According to the Global Energy Initiative, “Numerous scenarios projected levels of renewable energy for 2020 that already were surpassed by 2010.” The IEA states that, “In 2012, the world relied on renewable sources for around 13.2% of its total primary energy supply, and in 2013 renewables accounted for almost 22% of global electricity generation.”

With increased technological capabilities along with ever-growing concern over the state of the environment, the world is beginning to not only shift towards renewables, but the power over energy supplies and grids is decentralizing. For example, home solar panels or the new Tesla Powerwall, would enable people to access their own energy directly from the sun without going through middlemen. Another example is a local city like Burlington, VT being the first city in the U.S. to use 100% renewable energy; even whole countries like Paraguay, Iceland and Norway being 100% renewable. Cheap localized energy is on the horizon along with the very real possibility Nikola Teslaonce envisioned, which is a world of free energy.

The reemergence of organic food is not only on the rise, but the use of farmers markets and locally grown food is on the rise as well. According to the Non GMO project, “In more than 60 countries around the world, including Australia, Japan, and all of the countries in the European Union, there are significant restrictions or outright bans on the production and sale of GMOs.” The rise is so strong that according to the Organic Trade Association, “Supply shortages [of organics] are one of the greatest challenges facing the industry today. Despite continued growth in production, handlers are not able to keep up with demand.”

Thanks in large part to the Internet and non-corporate sponsored research, people are beginning to understand the importance behind knowing exactly what’s in the food one consumes and how it directly correlates to health. This has put mounting pressure on food businesses to adapt. The signs are already evident as Chipotle sees their profits increase while operating completely Non-GMO, while sales giants such as McDonalds see profits continue to decrease amidst health concerns over their food. Many are beginning to truly care what goes into their body and the rise of localized non-organic food in this country is a direct result of this health-conscious shift.

7. The Understanding Of a World of Abundance

As Gandhi famously said, “The world has enough for every man’s needs, but not for every man’s greed.” People are finally awaking to the fact that there is enough to go around, just not with the current systems in place. No one is saying there is enough for everyone to live at current western consumption rates, however with adoption of renewable energy, new forms of decentralized government and economics, and the increase in the usage of technological capabilities, there is more than enough for everyone in the world to live happily. For example, the world produces enough food for 10 billion people, yet many go starving as a result of faulty systems of distribution. Another example is water; there is more than enough water on the planet, but it’s the economic systems that get in the way of technology.

The notion of scarcity has long haunted the systems of government and economics, but now a new paradigm of abundance is beginning to take root in the minds of people. The Venus project is a prime example of an alternative resource based economy in which sustainability and resource supply are taken into account. A world of abundance with zero emission is no longer just a pipe dream, but could very well become a reality as people think in terms of abundance.

Finally a consciousness shift is underway in which people are starting to see themselves as more than just individual people operating in an isolated bubble, but instead as a connected piece in the collective consciousness of planet Earth. The Internet, along with the increased capacity for travel, has allowed people from all over the world to connect. So many parts of the global society have become interconnected and people are beginning to take notice of not only their own country, but countries abroad.

Many are beginning to realize that one group of people suffering means everyone is suffering. This interconnection to everything has given rise to practices such as meditation, yoga, and travel, as well as the continued global acceptance towards mind altering organic substances like marijuana and mushrooms. People are beginning to emotionally connect to life all over the world and not just their immediate home and surroundings. This new reality is showing people that there is more to life than money, as connection to all living things is equally, if not more, valuable.

As one can see, the world is very much in the early stages of a shift in consciousness and design. These shifts are leading to a growing decentralization movement in which the power controls of society are taken from the few and given to the many. Obviously, there is a very strong force at play that is fighting against this paradigm shift. This force is fighting for centralization of power in almost all facets of life. There can be no doubt of the presence of this resistance when one examines the ever-increasing wealth and power gap that is out of control in this country.

The actions taken by these elite organizations are getting more radical and desperate by the day. With all that being said, the global paradigm shift has one advantage that I believe will be the game changer, and that’s the will of the people. This is not just the people of a a single country, but internationally, as united global movements such as Occupy Wall street, the Arab Spring, and March Against Monsanto are happening simultaneously all over the world around central causes. So wake-up and participate, for we are in the early stages of a revolutionary paradigm shift in the consciousness of the masses that can truly change society for the better.

478,"1st Peter 4:12-17, “Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? More and more, as I grow older, I am rejoicing and thanking and praising God for His blessings in my life. Most of all, I thank God for the gift of His dear Son, Jesus Christ. John 3:16, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” During my 52 years of life, I have been through much suffering, pain of soul, frustration, loneliness, health afflictions, loss and betrayal; yet I am so happy to be a child of God. I thank God for the roof over my head, even though it is not mine. I thank God for the vehicle that I drive, even though it is worn and has a tire going flat that I need to get fixed. I thank God for my body, even though I have incurable stenosis and radiculopathy from a neck injury which afflicts me horribly with chronic pain 24/7. I thank God for my eyes, even though I am near-sighted and cannot see well at a distance. I do not like being divorced and alone, but I thank God that I wasn't the one who filed for divorce, and I thank God for my family. I thank God for my imperfect parents, imperfect pastor, imperfect childhood, imperfect life, imperfect free country that I am blessed to live in. Thank you Lord for all your blessings on me! I rejoice in knowing that my name is written in Heaven, in the Lamb's Book of Life. I thank God that He forgave me for all my sins at age 13, when I was born-again, which gives me the example, power and motivation to forgive others who have hurt me. I have forgiven everyone in my life. Ephesians 4:31-32, “Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.” It doesn't matter if others hate me, hurt me, or mistreat me, they are accountable to God for their actions, not me. I choose to love everyone with God's unconditional love. I receive a lot of e-mails from people struggling with sin, suffering from depression, angry at God, confused and hurting in their body and soul. I love helping all of them. For those of you who know me better than others, I love writing lengthy e-mails, pouring out my heart to help people. I am sure I even annoy some of my web visitors, writing a book back to them. Please pardon me! A lot of that stems from my loneliness as a single man. I love when people ask me questions, and I have an answer in the Lord to help them for Christ. It is my privilege. I pray for all my web visitors regularly and do love everyone with all my heart. I wish I could only do so much more to help people. I do what I can for God, giving Him all the credit, praise and glory. If there is anything good in me, it is the precious Lord Jesus Christ! Psalms 147:7, “Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; unto our God.” I bought a nice 21 string harp last year, but haven't spent much time with it. I have always loved playing stringed instruments. Lately (in recent months) I have kept busy working on my website ministry, and I've been emotionally down about life in general, so I haven't felt much like playing my music. I go through seasons of depression, and have learned that this is normal for me as a Christian. The Bible tells us how to handle depression in James 5:13, “ Is any among you afflicted? let him pray . Is any merry? let him sing psalms.” When I am sad and down about life, I bunker into the Word of God, work hard on my ministry, focus on soulwinning, and pray my way through the storm, trusting my beautiful all-knowing, all-powerful and all-loving God to see me through, year after year. Lamentations 3:26, “It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.” Isn't that a precious Bible verse!

Lamentations 3:26, “It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.”

There is nothing new under the sun. Just as today, it is human nature to be selfish. God had wonderfully blessed the Hebrews, but they took it all for granted and didn't appreciate what God had done for them. Moses warned the people to beware of forgetting about God in lieu of all His tremendous blessings upon them. God had miraculously parted the Red Sea right in front of them, so that they even walked across on dry ground! Yet the first thing they did when they got to the other side is COMPLAIN that they had no water. This is unbelievable, read it for yourself... Exodus 15:19 and 22 and 24, “For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. ... So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. ... And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? ” I get disgusted just from reading that. Those Hebrew ingrates—who had just witnessed God deliver them from Pharaoh's army, walking across the Red Sea floor on dry ground, then watching Pharaoh's army (men and horses alike) all drown when the waters returned upon them—started complaining just three days later in the Wilderness that they had no water, failing to have faith in the power and love of their great omnipotent God. It is incredibly amazing to me. Moreover, the Jews were warned again and again by Moses the prophet, to stop their complaining, lest it destroy them, but they didn't listen. After complaining for the TENTH TIME, God had finally had enough and banned them from ever entering into the Promised Land. God hates the sin of complaining! HE HATES IT!!! Pastor Jack Hyles preaches a powerful sermon on this very topic about complaining in a sermon titled: “THE HOTTEST HELL OF ALL!” People (whether it be fellow Christians, preachers, family, acquaintances or strangers) are always going to hurt our feelings. They will be inconsiderate, disappoint, let us down, gossip about us, judge us and make us sad if I focus on people—so I live above the clouds where Jesus lives! America has forgotten the God of the Bible. Deuteronomy 6:12, “Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.” So often in life, people receive good at the hand of God, but return nothing in the way of gratitude. In the Old Testament, we learn about a godly man named Job, who made a remarkable statement to his wife when she suggested that he curse God and die. Job 2:10, “But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.” Oh that we would all adopt the godly attitude of Job, who understood (as our text passage from 1st Peter shows) that life includes good and bad. I choose to praise God for the good in my life, and blame the Devil for the bad. It is not God's fault that I have made some stupid and unwise decisions in my life. Blessed be the name of the Lord, for He is faithful, fair and good to all! Psalms 145:9, “The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.” The heathen world is always placing God on trial, but we are the ones who refuse to obey His inspired Words in the Holy Bible. Job 9:3, “If he [man] will contend with him [God], he cannot answer him one of a thousand.” No one can ever blame God (Romans 1:20), for He is faithful. 2nd Timothy 2:13, “If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.” As Ron Hamilton (Patch The Pirate) says, every Christian should have: “THE GRATITUDE ATTITUDE!” Kindly, we are getting what we deserve as a foolish nation for forsaking the God of the Holy Bible. What can we expect from children who have grown up void of the knowledge of God? I read an article today about two 10 year old looking boys who are guilty of a carjacking. To add insult to injury, Freemasons (who control the United States) have introduced the blatant lies of Evolution in all public schools to intentionally lead impressionable children away from God, misleading them to think that they came from a Big Bang, stardust and from the same biological source as gorillas. What can we expect from such abused children? How can we expect children deprived of a God-centered education to exemplify God-like behavior? God is love! To deliberately withhold a God-centered education from a child, and substitute it with a fraudulent system of lies that reduce humanity to the level of animals, is a cruel form of child abuse! The whole scam of the rights of “atheists” not to have to hear the teachings of the Bible in public schools has destroyed the fiber of our society! I don't generally follow the news because it is so depressing, but I have been doing a lot of research for my ministry and reading through crime news lately. I didn't realize how bad things have become in American society. This is the obvious horrifying consequence of removing and banning the inspired Word of God from children's daily lives in public school classrooms since 1963. The Holy Bible has Always Been The Answer! You cannot deny that to the same degree that our country has abandoned the Word of God, to that same degree society is going to the Devil! I have also been watching the Forensic Files, using amazing science to solve horrifying crimes. The evildoer culprits are sometimes police officers, fire investigates, pastors and churchgoers. It is unbelievable what human beings are capable of! Truly the human race is depraved, just as the Holy Bible says. Romans 3:10-11, “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.” The city of Chicago is one of the most dangerous places on earth to live. The following article is just from one weekend... 7 Killed, 46 Wounded In Weekend Shootings; ‘It’s Destroying The Fiber Of Our Communities’ CHICAGO (CBS) — Dozens of people were shot in Chicago over the weekend, including two mass shootings in less than three hours on Sunday. In all, seven people were killed and 46 others were wounded in shootings since Friday evening. More than a dozen people were wounded, one of them fatally, in a pair of mass shootings in the Lawndale neighborhood early Sunday. The first shooting happened around 1:20 a.m. near Roosevelt and Francisco in Douglas Park. Police said a group of people was standing in the park, when someone opened fire from a black Chevrolet Camaro. Seven people were wounded:
• A 21-year-old man shot in the groin was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition;
• A 25-year-old woman shot in the arm and leg was taken to Mount Sinai, where she was stabilized;
• A 20-year-old man shot in the right side was taken to Stroger Hospital, where he was stabilized;
• A 19-year-old woman shot in the right leg was taken to Stroger, where she was stabilized;
• A 22-year-old woman was taken to Mount Sinai, where she was stabilized;
• A 21-year-old man shot in the left leg was taken to Mount Sinai, where he was stabilized;
• A 23-year-old man shot in the chest and hand took himself to Mount Sinai, where he was stabilized. Less than three hours later, eight people were shot in Lawndale, near 18th and Kildare around 3:45 a.m., when unknown s hooters opened fire on a large group of people at a block party. One man, 33-year-old Demetrius Flowers, was killed, and seven other people were wounded:
• A 35-year-old man shot in the forehead was taken to Mount Sinai, where he was stabilized;
• A 28-year-old man shot in the hip was taken to Mount Sinai, where he was stabilized;
• A 27-year-old man shot in the foot was taken to Mount Sinai, where he was stabilized;
• A 28-year-old man shot in the leg Mount Sinai, where he was treated and released;
• A 14-year-old boy was shot in the thigh, and was taken to Stroger, where he was stabilized;
• A 21-year-old woman suffered a graze wound to the thumb, and was treated and released at St. Margaret Hospital;
• A 19-year-old woman was shot in the head, and was taken to Stroger, where she was treated and released. Flowers’ father, said it’s the second son he’s lost to violence. “Please stop. It’s killing our families, it’s destroying the fiber of our communities. We have to stop this senseless killing, because if we don’t, there’s nothing going to be left. There’s nothing going to be left,” Keith Flowers said.

One young man unfortunately murdered over the weekend in Chicago, was 33 year old Demetrius Flowers. His father, Keith Flowers, made the following public statement:

I am not trying to be unkind, God knows my heart, but this father is preaching to the choir. Gang thugs don't care! Keith is making his statement to law-abiding citizens. I noticed in the preceding news story that 90% of the people shot were very young, close to 20 years old. That speaks volumes! Our youth are infested with evil today, because they have been deprived of God's Word in ungodly schools. Luciferians are behind the destruction of America! All high-level Freemasons worship Lucifer, the 99% lower initiates are woefully naive. The same is true of the CIA, U.S. government, Mormonism and other subversive and subverted groups. I am very sorry for Mr. Flowers' loss in the death of his son, and I am not belittling him in any way, God forbid. I am simply pointing out that it is not going to change anything to make statements about how people need to stop shooting each other. Children need the Word of God! 



If you don't allow thoughts of greed to dwell in your mind, then those thoughts cannot fester. No one suddenly goes out and purchases a life insurance policy on their spouse, and then plots to murder them in a clever way to make it look like an accident. Long before such wickedness came into that person's mind, there was already a heart of greed and ungodliness. The major underlying personal theme that I take away from the whole Forensic Files series is the following passage of Scripture from the Holy Bible...

That is the great truth that needs to be engrained into the minds of children, every single day of their school years. If I had my way, every child would recite this passage of Scripture along with their teacher every day, at the beginning of each class, so that it would be so engrained in their soul, that it would be a permanent part of their soul for the rest of their life. Children today don't love God. Their parents who grew up in America's Godless public school system, don't love God. Their grandparents, who grew up in America's ungodly school system after 1963, don't love God. Anyone in the United States today under the age of 74, didn't hear the inspired Word of God read in a public school. That is why crime is epidemic today across the United States, and it can be truthfully said of our culture:

I am going to preach the truth until I can no longer do so—THE KING JAMES BIBLE IS THE ANSWER!!!!!!!

Everyone who is guilty of hurting another human being, to provide the heinous crime to make another episode of Forensic Files, failed to heed the Bible's command to LOVE GOD and LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR! The two greatest commandments in the Word of God are to LOVE GOD, and LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR. Don't ever forget that truth and you won't go astray! As Brother Lester Roloff (1914-1982) said—these two commandments are really just one—TO LOVE! If we fall in love with our Maker, and allow God to love us, and allow God to love our fellow man through us, then we will never intentionally harm another human being. Amen! I sure hope somebody is listening.

Every Christian believer needs to be on-guard against sin continually, because anyone is capable of committing the worst sins under the right circumstances. That is what I mean by my article title: “Love, Forgive, Help, Work And Pray.” No one is above sin! NO ONE! The Bible admonishes us to take heed if we are misled to think we are doing okay, because we could commit an unthinkable crime just like the criminals we read about. Every criminal at one time was a law-abiding citizen! Proverbs 4:23, “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.” That Bible verse means to deal with the small sinful thoughts in your mind, before they grow into evil behavior! I want to think right, do right, and live right, to please God and stay out of trouble. I want to: “Love, Forgive, Help, Work And Pray.” If you maintain that godly attitude—of always loving others, and forgiving everyone, and helping everyone, and working honestly to stay busy, and praying for God's power and protection from evil—you will joyously prosper in the Christian life. There is no joy like knowing you are right with God and man. I want to live in such a way that no one can justly accuse me of doing evil. ...

Quite often, I have web visitors confide in me that they are struggling with the sins of lust, hatred, pornography, pride, rebellion, et cetera. I always try to help them in a spirit of meekness. Galatians 6:1, “Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.” The Bible teaches us in 2nd Corinthians 10:5, “Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” Here we learn how to live right! When a sinful thought enters into our mind, we are supposed to CAST DOWN THAT THOUGHT with the inspired Word of God (i.e., the King James Bible). By doing that, you prevent the Devil from filling your heart to do evil.

I refuse to have a garbage pail for a mind. Anyone can choose to live right! In the Old Testament, Job was a godly man who purposed in his heart to think and live right. Job 31:1, “I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?” I receive e-mails from young men who are struggling with lust and pornography. That is a very dangerous vice! The way to handle it is to take control of your thought-life and abstain from fleshly lusts. 1st Peter 2:11, “Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.” The Bible commands men to abstain from the lusts of the flesh. To look at filthy images is a CHOICE! Until you start making the right choices, you'll never gain victory over any sin. Each time you make the wrong sinful choice, it makes it a little easier to make another sinful choice, until you turn evil, and eventually you'll be the next episode of Forensic Files! Behind every tragedy in human character is a slow process of wicked thinking! 



Christians Are Pilgrims Not Settlers On Earth

It is important for every believer to embrace the mindset that this temporary world is not our home. Don't get too comfortable down here. Brother Lester Roloff (1914-1982) preached a wonderful sermon titled: “Don't Get Adjusted,” in which sermon he makes the truthful statement: “YOU LOSE OUT WHEN YOU GET ADJUSTED DOWN HERE!” I hate this wicked world! I am so sick and tired of the sin, the filth, and the ungodly transgendered homosexual agenda that is as a disease upon society today, sick of it all!!! Even so, come, Lord Jesus!!! Heaven is our home where we will ultimately settle (John 14:1-3). The heathen world places all emphasis on this earthly life, living for the moment with no thought of facing the Eternal God someday. As believers, we are commanded to—“Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:2-3). Oh, how Christians fail to follow the Lord's instruction in the Scriptures! When believers fret and worry and complain and focus on making money, “they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection” (Luke 8:14). Carnal believers aren't soulwinners!

All we hear about nowadays is that everyone should accept and respect the rights of homosexuals. The heart of the matter is God. What does God think? What does God say in His Holy Word? You've got the righteous speaking out against the evils of homosexuality, as the Bible tells us to do. Ephesians 5:10-12, “Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.” A man sodomizing another man's anus is a work of darkness! I am grossed out and sickened when I hear pastors of churches legitimizing the LGBTQ community, such as did Southern Baptist Convention president J.D. Greear. Proverbs 29:27, “An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.”

Kindly, I heard Tim Cook, the present CEO of Apple computer say publicly: “Being gay is God's greatest gift to me.” God calls Tim Cook a liar! Proverbs 28:9, “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.” Leviticus 20:13, “If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.” We are living in extremely wicked times, in which ungodly reprobates are elevating their own ungodly human lusts over the inspired Words of God. That is so wrong! Judges 21:25, “In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.” The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that a human being in a mother's womb is not yet a life, so it can be killed. God calls it murder (Exodus 20:13). ABORTION: HANDS THAT SHED INNOCENT BLOOD!!! It is hard to even imagine how a society could ever become so ungodly, uncaring, indifferent, calloused and far from God, that their leaders could justify murdering human life. And now in many states infanticide is legal, where a child is murdered while being delivered, and in Illinois, after leaving the womb. Ungodly State Of Illinois Declares Open Season On Children: Removes All Bans On Abortions! 



2nd Timothy 3:12, “Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” I am going to quote a rather lengthy passage from 1st Peter, to help you see the full context of what the apostle Peter is teaching us. The Bible teaches that when a Christian separates from their old life of sin, and from their old worldly acquaintances, they will think it strange, criticizing us and persecuting us in many cases. ...

The Bible admonishes Christians not to be surprised that worldly people hate us, persecute us and separate from us over our faith and stand for Christ. Jesus said in John 15:19 that if we were of the world, they would receive us; but because we are not of the world, we are followers of Christ our Savior, the world hates us. John 7:7 says they really hate Jesus, and that they see Christ in us. The world hates Jesus Christ!!!



 In Everything Gives Thanks!

Jesus miraculously healed ten men afflicted with the horrible incurable disease of leprosy. Today there is a cure for leprosy, since the 1940's, but in Bible times there wasn't and it was a much feared disease. Unbelievably, only one man had enough gratitude to come back to thank the Lord. Luke 17:17, “And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?” There are 86,400 seconds in each day, have you thanked God even once today for His abundant blessings? We ought to thank God continually for our food, comforts, family, salvation, the Holy Bible and manifold gifts that most people take for granted. James 1:17, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” Every good thing in your life comes from God, whether you acknowledge that fact or not. And also, within God's permissive will, everything bad that happens in our lives is allowed by God, which is a difficult truth to embrace. We live in a fallen world because of sin, beginning with Adam (Romans 5:12). When Adam chose to sin, he opened the floodgate of sin and death upon the world. This is why bad things happen to good people, and good things happen to bad people, and life is not fair!

Christians ought to be mindful of our blessings, especially in America where we have been blessed beyond all expectations compared to most of the impoverished world. Just the privilege and opportunity to go out to eat, in a fancy restaurants like Chilies or Burger King (that's fine dining to me), is something that most people living in the world cannot enjoy. We take so much for granted in America. We are so spoiled. It is a crying shame and the epitome of utter ingratitude—that amidst all these incredible blessings, liberty and modern comforts from God—that Americans are sinfully steeped into sexual immorality, 60 million children murdered by abortion, homosexuals marriages and all manner of filth, evil and wickedness!!! God deserves so much better, but Americans treat Him like garbage! We really do as a people! How do you think God feels that we have allowed our government to remove and ban the Holy Bible from children's lives? Honestly, so you have any idea how detrimental that has been to our nation? The Bible is the Sacred Book, the only Book in existence that teaches mankind to LOVE, yet hateful and ungodly reprobates have used stupid excuses to rid children of the only chance they have of growing up to become a loving human being! 



I suffer in constant chronic neck pain. My wife divorced me against my will in 2006, and I have lived alone ever since in the Lord (1st Corinthians 7:27). I have forgiven her completely, but as Dr. Jack Hyles wisely said: Divorce is a sin that perpetuates for a lifetime. I lost well over $100,000 as a result of the divorce. I lost my home after the divorce and have rented since. I lost my retirement. I lost my pets. I lost most of my possessions. I could go on and on for hours describing all the pain, loss, suffering and heartache in my life over the past 20 years. Pastor John K. Jenkins Sr. exposes the evils of divorce in his excellent sermon titled: The Devastating Demon That Destroys Families. I am as much a sinner as my former wife, so I do not point fingers. There are no perfect marriages. God says when you marry someone, you become one with them, so as far as I'm concerned her sins throughout our marriage were my sins too. WE HAVE SINNED!

Albeit, despite my misery, problems, pain and broken heart, I have the joy of the Lord in my soul. I have peace like a river. Isaiah 26:3, “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee .” I love that Bible verse! That is a solemn promise from our great God. The Lord promises perfect peace to the believer whose mind dwells and remains upon God. Psalms 1:1-2, “Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night .” The Bible says the reason why we have perfect peace is because we trust the Lord. Perfect peace comes from trusting God in everything! I choose to love, forgive, help, work and pray in the Lord, instead of worry, complain, hate harbor bitterness and place God on trial. I am going to continue to trust the Lord, though He slay me. Job 13:15, “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.” I am going to love everybody. I choose to forgive everyone even before they ask. I am trying by God's grace to help as many people as I can. I labor night and day for the Lord. I pray because Jesus said without Him we can do nothing (John 15:5). I need God's help in everything I do. Galatians 2:20, “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”

Everywhere I go today, I meet people who have contempt for Christians, churches and the Holy Bible, but they claim to love God. They are deceived. Nobody loves God who despises the King James Bible! Although many churches are corrupt, THE CHURCH has never been (nor ever could be) corrupted. Likewise, the INCORRUPTIBLE WORDS OF GOD cannot be corrupted (1st Peter 1:23). The corrupted modern Bible versions are NOT God's inspired Words. You can change the truth of God into a lie all you want (Romans 1:25), but you cannot change THE TRUTH! ...

Listen to me dear reader, whatever your hang up may be—whether it be struggling with sin, religious scrupulosity, finding God's will, depression or confusion—get into the Scriptures and you will grow! 1st Timothy 4:13-15, “Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all .” When somebody tells me that they are struggling with sin, I always point them toward the Holy Bible. Psalms 119:9, “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.” You cannot heed God's Word if you are not familiar with the contents of God's Word. SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES!!!

It was 23rd U.S. President Benjamin Harris (1833-1901) who wisely said:

Dear friend, The Holy Bible Has Always Been The Answer. Would to God that we still had that kind of wisdom today in leadership. I have been watching the Forensic Files, and in nearly every case of a person being convicted of First Degree Murder, the state refuses to use capital punishment. That is the sordid wisdom of this foolish and ungodly world. I am 100% for capital punishment, because that is God's wisdom. Please read: “THE CASE FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: HOW IT SAVED MY LIFE” (a needful doctrinally sound book by Dr. Max D. Younce). The foolish world never comes to their senses! 2nd Timothy 3:7, “Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.” The newsmedia reports the problem. Career professionals study the problem. Talk shows exploit the problem. Government legislates the problem. Police control the problem. HUMANITY IS THE PROBLEM!

I thank God for His precious inspired Word in the King James Bible, which is our Lamp. Psalms:119:105, “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” Humanity is the problem, because of our inherent sinful nature. The answer is the 'GOOD NEWS' (GOSPEL) of the Lord Jesus Christ crucified on the cross for our sins, buried and bodily resurrected the third day for our justification! John 6:47, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.”

How Permanent Is Your Salvation?

Mark 1:15: “...repent ye, and believe the gospel.”

“The mark of the child of God is that he loves everybody!”

And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

1319,"By means of a finite element algorithm we investigate the effects of lateral viscosity variations upon the horizontal motions currently detected by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) in Europe. Our approach is based on a suite of flat Earth models including a layered compressible Maxwell mantle and regions of anomalous viscosity localized both in the lithosphere and in the upper mantle. A detailed study of horizontal velocities expected in the periphery of the Fennoscandia ice-sheet is followed by a comparison between VLBI data and model predictions. Our results show that the rates of horizontal deformations are greatly sensitive to both lateral viscosity variations and deep mantle stratification, especially close to the margins of the ice sheet. We have found that among the Earth models studied here, those including both lateral variations and a sharp increase of mantle viscosity across upper and lower mantle are the most suitable to ‘explain’ the rates of horizontal velocity currently observed in Europe.",mainstream,M12297,flat.earth
1255,"Is a widespread coronavirus outbreak inside the United States inevitable? After weeks of generally optimistic statements, officials are now warning us to prepare for the worst. Over the past several days we have seen the number of confirmed cases outside of China escalate dramatically, and this has really rattled global financial markets. After being down more than 1,000 points on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell another 879 points on Tuesday. U.S. stocks have lost more then 1.7 trillion dollars in value in just two days. Much more importantly, a wave of tremendous panic is starting to sweep across America, and it looks like this crisis is just getting started.

Usually officials at the CDC choose their words very carefully so that they do not needlessly alarm the public. With that in mind, I would like for you to consider three statements that the CDC’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier made about a potential outbreak inside the United States during a press conference on Tuesday…

#1 “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country anymore but a question of when this will happen.”

#2 “Disruption to everyday life may be severe.”

#3 “We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad.”

Can you ever recall a top CDC official ever making statements this ominous?

In addition, Messonnier warned that it may soon become necessary for schools and businesses to greatly restrict person to person contact…

The CDC outlined what schools and businesses will likely need to do if the COVID-19 virus becomes an epidemic outbreak in the U.S. Schools should consider dividing students into smaller groups or close and use “internet-based tele-schooling,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call. “For adults, businesses can replace in-person meetings with video or telephone conferences and increase teleworking options,” Messonnier said.

On a temporary basis such measures would not be too disruptive, but what if this virus just keeps spreading month after month?

We are potentially facing a scenario that is truly unprecedented, and it is becoming increasingly clear that officials have lost confidence that they will be able to contain this virus. In fact, one former U.S. official told USA Today that “the horse is out of the barn”…

Dennis Carroll, former director of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Global Health Security and Development Unit, credited China’s “extraordinary control measures” with delaying the spread of the virus. But he said avoiding a pandemic is “very unlikely.”

“The dramatic uptick of cases in South Korea, Iran and Italy are reflective of a self-sustaining spreading of the virus,” Carroll, who now leads the Global Virome Project science cooperative, told USA TODAY. “And a clear message that the horse is out of the barn.”

At this point there are still only a few dozen confirmed cases in the United States, but authorities are bracing for the worst. If you can believe it, San Francisco Mayor London Breed just declared a state of emergency because of this virus…Mayor London Breed declared a local emergency in San Francisco Tuesday amid the coronavirus outbreak, despite there being no confirmed cases among the city’s residents.

“Although there are still zero confirmed cases in San Francisco residents, the global picture is changing rapidly, and we need to step-up preparedness,” Breed said in a statement. “We see the virus spreading in new parts of the world every day, and we are taking the necessary steps to protect San Franciscans from harm.”

And after being quite apathetic about this outbreak at first, people all over America are suddenly realizing that they should be preparing for a potential pandemic.

In fact, Silicon Valley investor Geoff Lewis created quite a stir when he asked for advice on stockpiling food. The following is the question that he posted on Twitter that caused so much of an uproar…

If one were hypothetically stockpiling four months of shelf stable food, what would folks recommend (optimizing for keto friendly)?

We haven’t seen anything like this in the United States in a very long time.

But we haven’t even had a single death from this virus in our country yet. How crazed will people get when victims start dropping dead in the streets like they have been in Wuhan?

There is now talk that the IOC could potentially cancel or postpone the Olympic Games in Tokyo. At one time such talk would have seemed crazy, but this is how serious this outbreak has become.

In Iran, the number of confirmed cases has now jumped to 95, although many people believe that the true number is far, far higher.

During a press conference on Monday, Iran’s deputy health minister attempted to downplay the seriousness of this outbreak, but on Tuesday we learned that he has been infected too…

Iran’s deputy health minister said he has tested positive for the novel coronavirus and is in self-quarantine at his home just a day after he appeared at a news conference in Tehran where he sought to quell fears about the outbreak. Iraj Harirchi, the head of Iran’s counter-coronavirus task force, announced the illness in a video online while vowing that authorities would continue working to control the spread.

Apparently not wanting to be outdone, one of the officials in South Korea that was overseeing the response to this outbreak decided to jump off a bridge…But in Seoul took on a more morbid tone Tuesday following reports in the local press that a civil servant from the Ministry of Justice’s Emergency Safety Planning Office jumped off a bridge in Seoul at around 5 am local time Tuesday.

The official was one of several individuals charged with overseeing the government’s response to the virus. As cases soar and hysteria mounts, we suspect this news won’t exactly help quiet the public’s nerves.

Suicide is never the answer to anything, and we should all be praying for that man’s family.

In Italy, the number of confirmed cases has grown by more than 15 times since Friday…Over in Italy, the number of confirmed cases has surpassed 300 to 322, while the number of dead climbed to 10, according to Italian emergency chief Angelo Borrelli, who said the newly deceased were over the age of 80. That’s up from just 20 confirmed cases on Friday.

Newly deceased were over 80 years old, says at press conference in Rome Tuesday. The new infections include three cases in southern Sicily region, Italian Civil Protection official Borrelli said.

All of a sudden, people all over Europe are wanting to avoid Italians because of the potential of catching the virus. In most cases that fear is irrational, but we do know that an Italian just spread the virus to a hotel in Spain’s Canary Islands…

Hundreds of staff and tourists staying at a hotel in Spain’s Canary Islands were put under lockdown on Tuesday, El Pais newspaper reported. One person who had stayed at the establishment was later found to have tested positive for the coronavirus.

I lived in Italy for a few years as a child, and I have a great love for the country.

It is so sad to watch what is happening over there, but the same things are going to start happening here. In fact, Dr. Messonnier has told the public that now is the time “to begin preparing” for a massive outbreak…

“People are concerned about this situation – I would say rightfully so,” Messonnier said. “But we are putting our concerns to work preparing. Now is the time for businesses, hospitals, communities, schools and everyday people to begin preparing as well.”

If you do prepare and all of this turns out to be a false alarm, at least you will be ready for the next crisis that is coming.

But if you don’t do anything to prepare and things get really, really bad, it could end up costing you dearly.

If this virus starts spreading across the United States like wildfire, you and your family will want to minimize contact with the public as much as possible. So stock up on the things you will need now, because when things start getting really crazy the stores will be cleaned out very quickly.

Coronavirus spreads to Germany, Switzerland, Croatia, Iraq, Spain, Algeria, Austria and Brazil while cases explode in Italy by 45% in one day

Over the last 36 hours or so, the coronavirus spread has now been confirmed in a slew of new countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Croatia, Iraq, Spain, Algeria and Austria. Cases are already confirmed in Belgium, Lebanon, Finland, Sweden, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Israel, Cambodia, Nepal, Afghanistan, Russia and many other countries.

An infection is now suspected in Brazil, which would make it the first South American nation to confirm a coronavirus infection, bringing the virus to a whole new continent. According to Brazil’s Health Ministry, one test of a local patient has reportedly come back positive. A second confirmation test is necessary to make the diagnosis “official.”

These are irrefutable facts, yet we still have naysayers throughout the media and across the cultural landscape who claim none of this is happening, that the coronavirus bioweapon system is “just another flu,” or that it’s a grand hoax being perpetrated by all these countries as some elaborate staged event to commit economic suicide for some unknown reason.

Pandemic denialism is essentially the “Flat Earth” version of epidemiology. According to the denialists, all the nations listed above are faking it, sacrificing their national economics to carry out some sort of elaborate hoax for some unimaginable reason.

Rush Limbaugh, meanwhile, still insists the coronavirus is just “the flu.” It’s a reminder why highly influential people should stick to their areas of expertise and not wander into areas where they very quickly demonstrate their shocking technical ignorance and lack of knowledge.

Coronavirus infections exploded overnight in Italy, rising to 322 confirmed cases, an increase of 100 from the previous day.

To try to stop the spread of the virus, Italy is running armed road blocks surrounding 12 towns, prohibiting road travel.

According to The Epoch Times, no one in Italy even knows the source of the outbreak, completely obliterating any argument from WHO officials that this is “contained” or “not a pandemic.” Via TET:

Italian health officials haven’t yet identified the source of the outbreak. Angelo Borrelli, the head of the Italian civil protection department, said the case count grew from 222 to 322, representing a 45% increase, in a 24-hour period from Monday evening to Tuesday evening.

According to the pandemic denialists, of course, Italy must be faking it for some reason. Yes, it’s an insane idea, but that’s what is now being promoted by the left-wing media and even some conservative journalists.

Notably, the very bureaucrat in Iran who told everybody the virus was no big deal is now infected himself. Also via TET:

Only a day earlier, a coughing and heavily sweating Iraj Harirchi said at a televised news conference in Tehran that “the situation is almost stable in the country.”

Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour confirmed Harirchi had the virus. Harirchi himself posted an online video saying he had it and that he had quarantined himself at home. He promised that authorities would bring the virus under control.

That’s reassuring, huh? The very government bureaucrat sitting in quarantine after accidentally getting infected is telling us all the government has it under control. The irony is almost pure comedy, if it weren’t so tragic.

San Franciso declares state of emergency while media tells us there’s no emergency at all

San Francisco, meanwhile, has just declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, even when CDC officials claim there are essentially zero confirmed cases in San Francisco.

According to the SF Chronicle, Mayor London Breed said more resources need to be allocated, “to make sure we are prepared,” even while the entire media establishment in America claims there’s nothing to be prepared for in the first place.

So why did San Fran just declare an emergency, then?

The CDC’s insane policy of “Don’t Test, Don’t Tell” is keeping America in the dark while the epidemic explodes across U.S. cities.",conspiracy,C0390b,coronavirus; flat.earth

USA Hockey’s board of directors will consider a proposal next month to ban fighting from all levels of amateur hockey in the United States. Junior A hockey, for 16- to 20-year-olds, is the last remaining level of the game under USA Hockey’s jurisdiction that still tolerates fighting. The push to outlaw fighting is being spurred by a recent spate of serious injuries resulting from fights and concern over the prospect of lawsuits. “We need to take a firm stand to preserve our sport, prevent catastrophic injury and avoid financial repercussions,” said Dr. Michael J. Stuart, the chief medical officer for USA Hockey, who has been a leader in the effort to ban fighting.

 Mayo cell therapy researcher plans to grow stem cells in space, where he thinks they will grow faster than on Earth

 by Charlie Patton

Abba Zubair, medical and scientific director of the Cell Therapy Laboratory at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, wants to test the feasibility of growing stem cells in outer space, cells that could be used to generate new tissue and even new organs in human beings.

Circulation: The Florida Times-Union reaches more than 120,000 daily and 173,000 readers Sunday.

Context: Abba Zubair, M.D., Ph.D., believes that cells grown in the International Space Station (ISS) could help patients recover from a stroke, and that it may even be possible to generate human tissues and organs in space. He just needs a chance to demonstrate the possibility.

He now has it. The Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), a nonprofit organization that promotes research aboard the ISS, has awarded Dr. Zubair a $300,000 grant to send human stem cells into space to see if they grow more rapidly than stem cells grown on Earth.

Dr. Zubair, medical and scientific director of the Cell Therapy Laboratory at Mayo Clinic in Florida, says the experiment will be the first one Mayo Clinic has conducted in space and the first to use these human stem cells, which are found in bone marrow.

Grand Forks Herald, Holiday blues: How to counteract seasonal sadness by Pamela Knudson, Sometimes, the very things people love about the holidays — the anticipation, the hustle and bustle, the celebrations — can leave some of us with a sense of sadness, emptiness and even depression. When such feelings arise, being aware and “doing the opposite” of our natural tendencies may be among the best ways to combat them, according to a behavioral health provider at Mayo Clinic.

943,"Mining towns draw monikers from it. Political leaders keep close tabs on it. Others flat out disparage it.

Indeed, uranium owns its share of controversy.

For years, the element has been tied to talk of nuclear weapons and the birth of the atomic age. Today, however, the metal has taken on a different role -- in the form of energy. In fact, much of the enriched uranium stored in nuclear weapons from the arms race has been rededicated to fueling the world's nuclear power reactors, which provided the world with almost 14 percent of its electricity in 2010 [source: Nuclear Energy Institute].

And it's extremely powerful, too. One 7-gram pellet of uranium fuel produces as much energy as 3.5 barrels of oil and 807 kilograms (1,779 pounds) of coal [source: Newfoundland Labrador DNR].

Beyond lighting up homes and businesses through nuclear power, uranium makes radioisotopes that produce radiation, which can help diagnose and treat certain medical conditions. It's also used for shielding and, in its depleted form, as counterweights for aircraft, too.

But where does uranium come from and how is it gathered?

Like other metals, uranium occurs naturally in rocks on the Earth's surface and can be extracted through uranium mining. Miners originally discovered uranium alongside radium, another element that was used as glowing, decorative paint (at least until people realized its harmful, radioactive effects). Uranium hit the market as a decorative glaze before its nuclear properties were discovered.

This heavy metal comes in several isotopes, or forms of the element with different numbers of neutrons. Depending on the stability of an isotope, some can be more radioactive (likely to give off energetic particles) and fissile (likely to produce nuclear fission) than others. Uranium-238 measures as the most abundant isotope of the element on Earth and can be found in rocks and seawater. But it's not as radioactive as uranium-235, the best-known form of uranium used to create nuclear reactions.

In this article, we'll chart the uranium mining process, tracking the element as it transitions from ore to fuel pellets ready to be used by nuclear reactors. We'll also look at the wax and wane of uranium mining, as well as the risks for humans and the environment by following the contentious debate over mining uranium in the backyard of the U.S.'s most iconic canyon.

889,"Mount Chimborazo has been anthropomorphized as a man in a stormy relationship with a shorter and more active female companion, the Tungurahua volcano, which is known to belch ash that lands on Chimborazo’s icy slopes. Josefina Vásquez, an archaeologist at the Universidad San Francisco in Quito, said that Chimborazo “has been venerated since pre-Columbian times” and is “still a sacred mountain where it’s thought to be close to God.”

On a recent climb to commemorate the 280th anniversary of a 1736 mission by the adventurer Charles Marie de La Condamine, a research team led by the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement in France found that Chimborazo was about 15 feet shorter than previously thought, but reaffirmed its status as the highest from the Earth’s center.

So why does Everest get all the glory? It’s all about the climb.

Scaling Everest typically requires a 10-day trek to base camp, six weeks of acclimatizing, and a seven- to nine-day trip to the top. Climbing Chimborazo can be done in about two weeks, with a one- or two-day hike after acclimatization, according to Todd Burleson, president of Alpine Ascents International, a mountaineering company based in Seattle.

One man stood up during the event's Q&A portion, expressing concern about climate change. Addressing it, the audience member said, should be an imperative to Christians commanded by the Bible to be stewards of the Earth.

""I always have problems when people come up and say the science is settled,"" said Santorum, winner of the 2012 Iowa caucuses. ""That's what they said about the world being flat. When someone says the science is settled you're not a scientist, because scientists never say the science is settled.""

727,"As investigators search for the man who they say set a small fire last week at D.C.-area pizza shop, Comet Ping Pong, followers of the debunked ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theory have been speculating about what was ""really"" behind the blaze.

""To destroy evidence or vengeance? I hope the latter,"" a user wrote on the public Facebook group ""PizzagateUncompromised,"" one of hundreds of comments in dozens of Facebook groups dedicated to the conspiracy theory.

In one group, users responded to news that Comet pizza was on fire with gifs of people eating popcorn. Others just celebrated.

""Burn baby burn that evil place of debauchery of children, torture and murder down,"" one user wrote.

Pizzagate — which alleged that Hillary Clinton and prominent Democrats ran a child sex and sacrifice ring out of the pizzeria's basement — has mostly waned since its nadir in December 2016, when a North Carolina man on a mission to rescue imaginary children fired several shots from an assault-style rifle inside the restaurant. Eclipsed by a related conspiracy theory, Qanon, pizzagate has decreased in popularity in part due to crackdowns by online platforms. Reddit banned the pizzagate groups in 2016 and YouTube recently announced a commitment to stop recommending conspiracy videos.

But they still have a home on Facebook.

In over 30 different open and closed Facebook groups, boasting more than 40,000 collective members, pizzagate followers have kept the conspiracy alive. In the face of reason, these pizzagate adherents have held tightly to ""evidence"" — mostly what they allege is coded language and symbols that link shapes to pedophelia and food products like cheese and pasta to children.

The members post misinformation and wild allegations linking just about anyone to a world-wide pedopehila ring. Their targets have included everyone and everything from local businesses to Tom Hanks to a random Facebook user wearing a t-shirt with the image of a slice of pizza on it. This week, a major topic of conversation has been Celine Dion's weight loss, which group members falsely attributed to an addiction to Adrenochrome, a real chemical compound that pizzagate conspiracists claim is ""harvested"" from tortured children, and taken by the political and Hollywood elite to get high.

None of this is borne out by any evidence to be true in any way.

In 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the platform was refocusing the Newsfeed so that users would see less content from media and brands and more from their friends, family and groups. For the majority of Facebook users, that meant more posts from local parent collectives, spread out family groups, or like-minded hobbyists.

For the more conspiratorial user, it can amount to a curated cult.

It's not merely the existence of pizzagate-like conspiracy groups, but the mechanisms by which Facebook serves them up, that can radicalize users, said Renée DiResta, a researcher of disinformation online and director of research at New Knowledge.

Joining a Facebook group tells Facebook to suggest other groups and pages related to the topic.

""If you like something, it will show you more of that,"" DiResta said. ""So belonging to gardening groups will make Facebook suggest to you more gardening groups.""

Facebook's suggestion algorithm also infers commonalities between users and other members of groups that user joins.

""In a healthy way, this may mean Facebook is saying 'If you like gardening, maybe you also like cooking,'"" DiResta said. ""In the case of conspiracy content, Facebook's recommendation engine says, 'If you like pseudoscience, I'll show you chemtrails and flat earth.'""

""Because of the increase of ominous conspiracies, you're seeing groups around these conspiracy theories like QAnon or pizzagate being referred to people who would never search for them in the first place.""

As an example, for users who find their way into a pizzagate interest group named after Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta — whose stolen emails are misread in a way to inform much of the Pizzagate conspiracy — a right rail labeled ""Suggested Groups"" includes the group ""Pizzagate Reports,"" the header image for which is prominent Democrats including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and George Soros, photoshopped with glowing red eyes in what appears to be a Satanic ritual.

Similarly, users visiting the private group ""Pizzagate,"" topped with an image that points to Comet's owner James Alefantis as the ringleader of a child sacrifice ring — are pushed to join other fringe groups including, ""Real UFO Sightings & Strange Phenomenon,"" ""Official Flat Earth & Globe Discussion,"" and ""Q Angels,"" a group dedicated to an unfounded conspiracy theory involving Donald Trump and a secret war against a cabal of alleged child abusers.

Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. In a July interview with Recode editor Kara Swisher, CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the practice of letting conspiracy groups remain, but acknowledged Facebook's responsibility to take down misinformation that could induce violence.

Alefantis told The Washington Post that the shop still regularly gets harassing phone calls, a practice discussed in several of the pizzagate Facebook Groups.

""At first [the manager] said I was making him physically shake and now he just listens to me until he finally hangs up. He never really answers or addresses my concerns. But I still call. Once a day, every day,"" one woman wrote last year under a post about her efforts to call Comet regularly.

1037,"Investor Warren Buffett would be more comfortable with fellow billionaire Michael Bloomberg winning the Democratic presidential nomination than front-runner Bernie Sanders.

“ ‘I don’t think another billionaire supporting him would be the best thing to announce. But sure, I would…have no trouble voting for Mike Bloomberg’ ”

That is Buffett in an interview with CNBC on Monday morning when the Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, BRK.B, chairman and chief executive, was pressed on a Democratic presidential race that’s seen Sanders, a Vermont socialist, take an early lead in the race to the nomination.

Unlike Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs chief who has engaged in a bitter war of words with Sanders to the senator’s apparent delight, Buffett said Sanders has raised some valid issues.

Keywords: Ex-Goldman boss Lloyd Blankfein ‘might find it harder to vote for Bernie’ than for Trump

“I would say this in terms of Sanders, I actually agree with him in terms of certain things he would like to accomplish. I don’t agree with him in many ways. But in terms of the fact that we ought to do better by the people that get left behind by our capitalist system. I don’t think we should kill the capitalist system in the process,” Buffett said.

Buffett, who backed Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy in 2016, said he wouldn’t attempt to handicap the race for the nomination, but said that “if given a choice, I would certainly vote for Mike Bloomberg as opposed to Sanders.”

Stocks were down sharply on Monday as worries about the spread of COVID-19 outside China sparked a global equity rout. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, was down more than 1,000 points in afternoon trade. The blue-chip gauge and the S&P 500 SPX, were both off more than 3% on the day.

Need to Know:Warren Buffett says ‘don’t buy or sell’ on the headlines as coronavirus sends stocks plunging

Buffett said he wouldn’t cast a vote based on how he would expect the market to react to a particular candidate.

He said that an outcome that produced a Sanders presidency accompanied by a Democratic-controlled House and Senate would be significantly different from a scenario with President Donald Trump winning re-election with a Republican House and Senate.

“But I don’t think I would necessarily vote on what — in fact, I know I wouldn’t vote on what I thought necessarily would affect the market the better,” he said. “I think it’s a very poor yardstick. I would not want to cast my vote in a presidential election based on which would be better for the market in the next 30, or 60, or 90 days after the election.”

Still, Buffett, whose father was a four-term Republican congressman, said that while usually votes Democratic, it hasn’t always been a lock in the past.

“Well I think I’m going to wait and see who gets the nomination,” he said. “I’m a Democrat, but I’m not a card-carrying Democrat.”",mainstream,M0ee98,flat.earth
802,"Speakers recently flew in from around (or perhaps, across?) the Earth for a three-day event held in Birmingham: the UK’s first ever public flat Earth convention. It was well attended, and wasn’t just three days of speeches and YouTube clips (though, granted, there was a lot of this). There was also a lot of team-building, networking, debating, workshops – and scientific experiments.

Yes, flat earthers do seem to place a lot of emphasis and priority on scientific methods and, in particular, on observable facts. The weekend, in no small part, revolved around discussing and debating science, with lots of time spent running, planning, and reporting on the latest set of flat Earth experiments and models. Indeed, as one presenter noted early on, flat earthers try to “look for multiple, verifiable evidence” and advised attendees to “always do your own research and accept you might be wrong”.

While flat earthers seem to trust and support scientific methods, what they don’t trust is scientists, and the established relationships between “power” and “knowledge”. This relationship between power and knowledge has long been theorised by sociologists. By exploring this relationship, we can begin to understand why there is a swelling resurgence of flat earthers.

Let me begin by stating quickly that I’m not really interested in discussing if the Earth is flat or not (for the record, I’m happily a “globe earther”) – and I’m not seeking to mock or denigrate this community. What’s important here is not necessarily whether they believe the Earth is flat or not, but instead what their resurgence and public conventions, such as the one in Birmingham, tell us about science and knowledge in the 21st century.

Multiple competing models were suggested throughout the weekend, including “classic” flat Earth, domes, ice walls, diamonds, puddles with multiple worlds inside, and even the Earth as the inside of a giant cosmic egg. The level of discussion however often did not revolve around the models on offer, but on broader issues of attitudes towards existing structures of knowledge, and the institutions that supported and presented these models.

Flat earthers are not the first group to be sceptical of existing power structures and their tight grasps on knowledge. This viewpoint is somewhat typified by the work of Michel Foucault, a famous and heavily influential 20th century philosopher who made a career of studying those on the fringes of society to understand what they could tell us about everyday life.

He is well known, among many other things, for looking at the close relationship between power and knowledge. He suggested that knowledge is created and used in a way that reinforces the claims to legitimacy of those in power. At the same time, those in power control what is considered to be correct and incorrect knowledge. According to Foucault, there is therefore an intimate and interlinked relationship between power and knowledge.

At the time Foucault was writing on the topic, the control of power and knowledge had moved away from religious institutions, which previously had a very singular hold over knowledge and morality, and was instead beginning to move towards a network of scientific institutions, media monopolies, legal courts, and bureaucratised governments. Foucault argued that these institutions work to maintain their claims to legitimacy by controlling knowledge.

In the 21st century, we are witnessing another important shift in both power and knowledge due to factors that include the increased availability of public platforms afforded by social media. Knowledge is no longer centrally controlled and – as has been pointed out in the wake of Brexit – the age of the expert may be passing. Now, everybody has the power to create and share content. When Michael Gove, a leading proponent of Brexit, proclaimed: “I think the people of this country have had enough of experts”, it would seem that he, in many ways, meant it.

It is also clear that we’re seeing increased polarisation in society, as we continue to drift away from agreed singular narratives and move into camps around shared interests. Recent PEW research suggests, for example, that 80 per cent of voters who backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election – and 81 per cent of Trump voters – believe most supporters of the two candidates are unable to agree on basic facts, let alone policies.

Despite early claims, from as far back as HG Wells’s World Brain essays in 1936, that a worldwide, shared resource of knowledge, such as the internet, would create peace, harmony and a common interpretation of reality, it appears that quite the opposite has happened. With the increased voice afforded by social media to a wide range of views, knowledge has been increasingly decentralised, and competing narratives have emerged.

This was something of a recurring theme throughout the weekend in Birmingham, and was especially apparent when four flat earthers debated three physics PhD students. A particular point of contention occurred when one of the physicists pleaded with the audience to avoid trusting YouTube and bloggers. The audience and the panel of flat earthers took exception to this, noting that “now we’ve got the internet and mass communication … we’re not reliant on what the mainstream are telling us in newspapers, we can decide for ourselves”. It was readily apparent that the flat earthers were keen to separate knowledge from scientific institutions.

At the same time as scientific claims to knowledge and power are being undermined, some power structures are decoupling themselves from scientific knowledge, moving towards a kind of populist politics that is increasingly sceptical of knowledge. This has, in recent years, manifested itself in extreme ways – and can be seen in such examples as public figures showing support for Pizzagate or Trump’s suggestions that Ted Cruz’s father shot JFK.

But it can also be seen in more subtle and insidious forms: in the way in which Brexit, for example, was campaigned for in terms of gut feelings and emotions rather than expert statistics and predictions. Science is increasingly facing problems with its ability to communicate ideas publicly, a problem that flat earthers, and politicians, are able to circumvent with moves towards populism.

Again, this theme occurred throughout the weekend. Flat earthers were encouraged to trust “poetry, freedom, passion, vividness, creativity, and yearning” over the more clinical regurgitation of established theories and facts. Attendees were told that “hope changes everything”, and were warned against blindly trusting what they were told. This is a narrative echoed by some of the celebrities who have used their power to back flat Earth beliefs, such as the musician BOB, who tweeted: “Don’t believe what I say, research what I say.”

In many ways, a public meeting of flat earthers is a product and sign of our time; a reflection of our increasing distrust in scientific institutions, and the moves by power-holding institutions towards populism and emotions. In much the same way that Foucault reflected on what social outcasts could reveal about our social systems, there is a lot that flat earthers can reveal to us about the current changing relationship between power and knowledge. And judging by the success of this UK event – and the large conventions planned in Canada and America this year – it seems the flat Earth is going to be around for a while yet.

48,"The debate over genetically modified (GM) crops may be stalled in the European Union’s Council of Ministers, but last week the private sector appeared to deliver its own verdict on the future of the technology in Europe.

BASF, a German chemical company, announced on 16 January that it will end production of GM crops for the European market and move its plant-science headquarters from Limburgerhof in Germany to the United States. It will also close other sites in Germany and Sweden, though it will maintain existing facilities in Belgium and Berlin.

“There is still a lack of acceptance for this technology in many parts of Europe from the majority of consumers, farmers and politicians,” says Stefan Marcinowski, a member of BASF’s board. “It does not make business sense to continue investing in products exclusively for cultivation in this market.”

BASF will discontinue the marketing of the Amflora potato, one of only two GM crops authorised for cultivation by the European Commission. This will leave Monsanto’s MON810 maize as the only GM crop authorised for cultivation and marketed in the EU. Environmental campaigners cheered the move as a vindication of European consumers’ rejection of the technology. “It’s not often that we share an analysis with BASF, but they’re right that there’s no demand,” says Mute Schimpf, a food campaigner with Friends of the Earth.

But the biotechnology sector warned that Europe risks falling behind its global competitors because of “scaremongering and misinformation” about this emerging science, which changes the DNA of crops to make them more efficient. Werner Langen, a German centre-right MEP, says that the decision by BASF “shows that the patchwork of national regulations made in this field has made Europe an unattractive location” for GM research.

While authorisations of GM crops have increased steadily in other parts of the world, particularly the Americas, approval has been stalled in Europe for several years because of political opposition. Around 50 GM crops grown outside the EU have been authorised for import, mostly used for industrial use or animal feed.

Member states remain divided over the issue of GM crops. A blocking minority of countries – including Austria, Hungary, Poland and Greece – has refused to accept new authorisations for GM cultivation. This has irritated pro-GM countries such as the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK, which are eager to deploy the technology. The Commission has been able to authorise only these two crops for cultivation, and some member states have imposed national bans. These bans were eventually found to be illegal under single market rules.

Seeking a compromise, the Commission proposed allowing member states to enact their own national bans, with the implicit understanding that in exchange they would stop blocking new authorisations. But the proposal has remained stalled because the anti-GM states want to be able to ban the crops on the basis of environmental or health concerns. The Commission argues that this is not possible, because food cannot be deemed safe in one country but unsafe in another.

Last week’s announcement by BASF that it is abandoning its production of GM crops in Europe because of a lack of acceptance “from the majority of consumers, farmers and politicians” was an acknowledgement of a reality many biotechnology companies have been hesitant to countenance – Europe does not like genetically modified crops. A 2010 Eurobarometer survey found that 70% of Europeans think that GM food is “fundamentally unnatural”, and 59% say that such food is unsafe for their health. A 2003 government study in the United Kingdom found that only 2% of Britons would be happy to eat GM foods. So-called frankenfood, as the British tabloid press has dubbed them, have had a rough welcome in Europe. In December 2010 one million signatures calling for a ban on GM crops were delivered to the Commission as the first ‘citizens initiative’ created by the Lisbon treaty. But Europeans are virtually alone in this staunch resistance to GM crops. In north and south America, genetically modified crops have been introduced into the food chain without anyone much noticing or caring. A 2006 study by the Pew Research Group showed that Americans remain largely unaware of the existence of GM crops, with only 40% having heard of them and only 26% believing they have eaten them. The majority of Americans say they do not have concerns about GM crops. Public perception has translated into public policy. The EU’s two approvals of GM crops for cultivation do not match the more than 80 in the US and 36 in Brazil. China and India are also approving more GM crops, albeit more cautiously than in the Americas. The European Commission has tried to alleviate member state concerns about the crops by offering to let them opt out of EU authorisation, but the issue is stuck in the Council. Today 10% of the world’s arable land is growing GM crops. A report published by Friends of the Earth last year found that less than 0.06% of EU fields contain GM crops. Carel du Marchie Sarvaas of EuropaBio attributes the better reception of GM crops in the United States to faster movement by the industry. “In the US, the technology was already there when the anti-GM movement came on people’s radar,” he says. “In the Americas there’s much greater faith in science as a tool for progress, and the food industry in the Americas has been very supportive of science.” But according to Friends of the Earth, the increased focus in Europe is the result of work by non-governmental organisations to bring the issue to the public’s attention. “A lot of European consumers are concerned about the open questions of health with GM crops,” she says. “In north and south America they have no labelling system, and consumers are not aware of what’s going on.” “We cannot ignore the massive opposition in Europe,” says Ladislav Miko, deputy director-general for the food chain in the Commission’s health department. “This is why we believe the issue needs more clarity and more public information.” “People need to be convinced there are benefits for the normal citizen,” he adds. “If they think the benefit is just for farmers and companies, people won’t support that.”

Environmental campaigners are urging the anti-GM states to stand their ground, saying it is reasonable to have different health concerns in different countries. “Europe is quite diverse, you have specific ecosystems in different member states,” says Schimpf. She is unaware of any other products that have different environmental concerns in different states, but says GM crops are unlike other products of concern because they can multiply and they enter the food chain.

GM crops have been around for 15 years, and to date no adverse health effects from approved strains have been documented anywhere in the world. European consumers are already eating meat from animals raised on GM feed imported into the EU, and no adverse health effects have been found. But environmental campaigners say not enough is yet known about the health effects, and more research is needed before they are embraced. “The EU needs to follow the precautionary principle,” says Schimpf.

But advocates of GM crops say that such hesitation is foolish when the potential of the technology to solve societal challenges is so large. “We have a rapidly increasing population, we have to produce more food and we have to do it more sustainably,” says Carel du Marchie Sarvaas, a director with EuropaBio, a pan-European biotechnology industry group. “The only way to do that is to produce more from the same amount of land. [GM crops] allow farmers to produce more yield per hectare.” He adds that more efficient crops mean less time spent tilling the land, translating to fewer CO2 emissions from farm equipment.

In Spain, the EU country that has embraced GM crops most enthusiastically, farmers have reported getting from 6% to 30% more yield by using Monsanto’s MON810 maize. Between 2010 and 2011, Spain saw a 27% increase in the acreage planted. Portugal, which started planting GM later, saw a 59% increase during that time.

Much has been made of the potential of GM crops to combat famine in Africa, and Bill Gates has been one of the leading advocates of the technology to help developing countries (see interview, Page 4). Strains of drought-resistant maize are currently being developed, as well as virus-resistant strains of staple crops.

But many groups and governments remain doubtful about the technology. Aside from the perceived uncertainty around health, campaigners are also concerned that the use of GM crops is giving rise to pesticide-resistant plants. Biotechnology companies have insisted that this trend is not linked to the use of GM crops, but is a normal problem encountered when crops are not properly rotated.

Ethical objections have also been raised to the practice of patenting the GM seeds. Farmers normally pay a one-time price for seeds, which they can then save and replant. But GM seeds are acquired through the payment of a licence fee for the intellectual property. This was the case for BASF’s Amflora potato. “It’s a democratic question – do we want to allow a few companies to control what we eat?” asks Schimpf.

But with the rest of the world increasingly embracing GM crops, is it possible for Europe to be a GM-free continent? That question is being asked at both a macro and micro level. Even if the anti-GM countries secure the right to enact national bans on environmental grounds, there are questions over cross-fertilisation from neighbouring countries. If Austria enacts a ban, the wind can carry seeds from neighbouring Germany, campaigners warn.

EuropaBio rejects this argument. “Political realism means we accept that the way forward is that some countries will choose to grow GM crops and some won’t,” says du Marchie Sarvaas. “They can exist as non-GM ‘islands’,” he says, adding that some farms grow GM crops alongside conventional crops and there is still no cross-fertilisation. “But Europe cannot determine what the people from whom they import grow, and that’s the challenge.”

This challenge has already been encountered. Last year the Commission was forced to end its zero-tolerance policy for imports, which barred a shipment from entering the EU if it contained any trace of a GM strain not authorised in the EU. This was changed to a threshold of 0.1% after some crops were mistakenly sent back. With so many GM crops being used in the Americas, cases of contamination in imports are a concern.

But Schimpf says the embrace of GM crops in the Americas should not pressure the EU into going in the same direction. “For me, it’s the same as when we have higher labour standards,” she says. “We can insist that importers must comply with EU standards. Europe wouldn’t authorise a car just because it was authorised in China, we want to have our own safety checks.” With the expansion of GM planting across the world, the pressure on the EU to make up its mind one way or the other will only increase.",mainstream,M148ed,flat.earth; gmo
1075,"People look for usable clothing among rubble in the Petobo neighborhood which was hit by an earthquake and liquefaction in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, October 8, 2018.

When the violent shaking from a massive magnitude 7.5 earthquake finally stopped, Selvi Susanti stood up and realized something strange was happening. First, she saw the ground suddenly begin to sink. Then the pavement split beneath her feet like a broken dinner plate and started to rise.

Terrified, she clung to a small sliver of asphalt and surfed a river of fast-moving mud as it swallowed entire neighborhoods, carrying her higher than coconut trees for a quarter of a mile.

""What I saw — oh my God! Houses were tumbling. They started to roll like waves. It's like a tsunami, but the difference was they were waves of soil,"" said Susanti, 38, weeping at the memory of seeing so many people simply disappear into the earth as they screamed for help. ""It felt like I was in a boat, moving around. But the difference is I was not in water, but in the mud.""

Many, like Susanti in the devastated village of Petobo, had no idea they were in an area already identified by the government as a high-risk zone for the devastating geological phenomenon that causes soft ground to liquefy during earthquakes.

But Indonesian scientist Gegar Prasetya wasn't surprised by any of the events that occurred at dusk on Sept. 28, killing nearly 2,000 people and leaving possibly thousands more missing. He had warned people for years that the area around Sulawesi island's Palu Bay had been struck before and was due for another potential combination of factors to create a perfect storm capable of unleashing earthquakes, landslides, tsunami waves and soil liquefaction.

""I knew right away,"" said Prasetya, co-founder of the Tsunami Research Center Indonesia, who had met with government officials and residents in the area to try to raise awareness about the threat. ""I posted in our group, and I said, 'It's happened.'""

Disaster-prone Indonesia, part of the Pacific Basin's ""Ring of Fire,"" is an archipelago of about 17,000 islands sitting atop numerous fault lines that have produced some of the largest and most deadly earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions in recorded history.

Other scientists around the world wondered how this type of earthquake — on a strike-slip fault, which typically does not produce dangerous tsunamis — could generate waves that surged as high as 6 meters (20 feet).

He had published a paper nearly two decades ago highlighting six other tsunamis recorded in the Makassar Strait in the past century, predicting that a repeat event could be expected roughly every 25 years. The last one occurred in a region north of the city in 1996. Before that, Palu Bay was hit in 1968 by a very similar magnitude 7.4 quake that generated waves 10 meters (33 feet) high.

""This one complete village went to the sea,"" he said of the 1968 event. ""You can still see the trees from the top of the water.""

Some experts theorize that the Sept. 28 quake, by itself, didn't generate a big wave despite being shallow and near the coast. They're convinced it was instead the area's soft soil that served as the real catalyst for disaster. The temblor's long, violent shaking likely triggered one or more underwater landslides due to unstable sediment deposited on the seafloor by rivers. This disruptive movement may have created the large wall of water that raced across the open ocean until being squeezed into the long, narrow bay that surrounds Palu, forcing the wave to grow higher.

""Imagine what happens if you drop a brick in a flat pond — ripples spread in all directions,"" said Robert Hall, a geologist at Royal Holloway University of London, who has studied the area. ""Now drop the same size object in a bathtub. The waves can reflect off the sides, can amplify, and may get larger in the direction of the length of the bath.""

But it wasn't just weak sediment in the ocean that gave way. Wet, sandy soil also separated and came alive through liquefaction in some areas due to the earthquake's radical vibrations. The ground simply lost its strength and turned to mush beneath people's feet, creating mud that acted like quicksand. People, houses, cars and streets were swallowed and covered by a thick carpet of what — just seconds earlier — had been solid earth. Fast-moving landslides also were launched above ground, possibly causing even more localized tsunami waves.

""We wouldn't necessarily expect to get all the worst possible factors occurring together,"" said Willem De Lange, a scientist from the University of Waikato in New Zealand who co-authored research on the area with Prasetya in 2001. ""Unfortunately this does happen.""

Many questions remain about exactly what happened in this complex disaster. Prasetya will begin field work with the Indonesian navy this week to try to better understand what occurred under water, and a team of international experts are expected to arrive next month to carry out an assessment.

Palu's population has exploded in many high-risk areas since the 1968 event, which killed 200 people and also turned soil to mud in places, leaving many newcomers vulnerable with no local history.

However, the central government did produce a map in 2012 identifying large swaths of Palu, a city of 380,000 people, where liquefaction could occur. The area of Petobo, for instance, was classified as having high-risk potential. The report also recommended that housing and industrial areas should best be built in areas with low liquefaction risk. It suggested mitigation efforts, including building structures with deep foundations anchored into firmer layers of earth.

Good urban planning is ultimately the key to saving lives, said Sri Hidayati, head of earthquake mitigation at the Energy Ministry's Geology Agency, which produced the report that was shared with the provincial and district governments in Sulawesi. She said it's her agency's responsibility to provide the mapping, but it's up to local authorities to ""use it or not."" Calls Monday to Palu's vice mayor and the mayor's aid went unanswered.

""If everything in the future is planned based on this, I think maybe we will only experience a small number of casualties in case such a disaster occurs again,"" she said. ""Or probably no casualties at all.""

At a news conference in Jakarta on Monday, the head of the country's disaster agency also confirmed that soft soil areas in Palu are not fit for housing.

""It is impossible to rebuild in areas with high liquefaction risk such as Petobo and Balaroa,"" he said, adding that people still living there will be relocated.

Indonesia has been criticized for lifting the tsunami warning it issued for Sulawesi's coast too soon. The earthquake knocked out power and telecommunication towers, meaning sirens didn't wail and alerts didn't light up mobile phones. Online video showed an unsettling scene as cars and motorbikes drove at normal speeds on a coastal road and oblivious people milled about on the beach while the large, fast-moving wave could be seen racing closer before exploding onshore.

""It's almost impossible for a tsunami warning system to predict what we saw the other day,"" said Adam Switzer, a tsunami expert at the Earth Observatory of Singapore. ""The earthquake is the warning. If you're anywhere in southeast Asia and you're on the coast and you feel an earthquake, move inland and move to higher ground and stay there.""

But it's also not a matter of only warning people just before something happens. Prasetya said the history and geology of Palu Bay must be considered in plans to rebuild. He said soil investigations should be carried out to determine if deep piles are needed to stabilize buildings. Local knowledge should also be considered as a cheap way to save lives, such as constructing houses out of wood with thatched roofs, instead of concrete and tile.

In Petobo, tsunami warnings would not have helped because there was no time to respond. All that remains of the village, located about 30 minutes from the center of Palu, is a muddy wasteland where only the very tips of roofs remain above ground in places. Satellite images show a heavily populated area stretching more than 100 hectares (250 acres) being devoured by what looks like a giant layer of chocolate milk. In mobile phone videos, buildings are seen sliding like pucks across a slab of ice. Some people spent hours trying to find their homes after the disaster, locating them about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from where they once stood.

""It felt like we were spinning in a blender,"" recalled Susanti, who survived by leaping to solid ground and running after the mud flow finally slowed down. ""I saw houses change position. Houses which were located at the east moved to the west and vice versa. I saw the twisted mud was shaped like dough.""

Recovering bodies from Petobo and other hard-hit areas, such as Balaroa, has been difficult because heavy equipment will sink in the soft soil and is unusable there. The government is considering turning some of these sites into mass graves, according to Wiranto, Indonesia's security minister, who uses one name.

""It is already a ghost village. I will not go back there even if they pay me 1 billion rupiah ($65,800),"" said Erli Yati, 32, who also survived what's been dubbed a ""land tsunami"" by some in Petobo.

She had no idea about the previous disasters there or that the ground could come alive as it did.

""I will not step back to that place again,"" she added. ""That was the worse experience I have ever had.""

Prasetya commended the idea of closing off liquefaction areas and said mitigation — whether it's creating and enforcing proper building codes in at-risk zones or relocating people to safer places — should be implemented before the next disaster.

""How many souls need to be sacrificed until the government knows mitigation is important?"" he asked, adding he's been sounding alarms since the massive 2004 earthquake-spawned tsunami off Sumatra island killed 230,000 people in a dozen nations, more than half of them in Indonesia. ""Everything is back to business as usual.""",mainstream,M078f7,flat.earth
184,"We now know where a Japanese asteroid-sampling probe's lander will touch down this October.

The Hayabusa2 spacecraft's Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout (MASCOT) will land at a site in the asteroid Ryugu's southern hemisphere dubbed MA-9, mission officials announced today (Aug. 23).

MA-9 won out over nine other finalists because it offered the best combination of scientific potential and accessibility, MASCOT team members said. [Japan's Hayabusa2 Asteroid Sample-Return Mission in Pictures]

""From our perspective, the selected landing site means that we engineers can guide MASCOT to the asteroid's surface in the safest way possible, while the scientists can use their various instruments in the best possible way,"" MASCOT project manager Tra-Mi Ho, of the DLR Institute of Space Systems, said in a statement. (DLR is the German Aerospace Center, which operates MASCOT with support from the French space agency, CNES.)

MA-9 features relatively fresh, pristine surface material that hasn't been exposed to cosmic radiation for long compared to other parts of the 3,000-foot-wide (950 meters) asteroid, team members said. And Hayabusa2 will drop three small rovers onto patches of the space rock's northern hemisphere, so a southern site for the 22-lb. (10 kilograms) MASCOT will give the mission greater coverage of the space rock, they added.

In addition, MA-9 isn't quite as boulder-studded as most other Ryugu regions. That doesn't mean landing there will be a breeze on Oct. 3, however.

""But we are also aware: There seem to be large boulders across most of Ryugu's surface and barely [any] surfaces with flat regolith,"" Ho added. ""Although scientifically very interesting, this is also a challenge for a small lander and for sampling.""

The $150 million Hayabusa2 mission launched in December 2014 and arrived at Ryugu on June 27 of this year. If all goes according to plan, the spacecraft will study the big asteroid from orbit for another 16 months and also drop down several times to grab samples of Ryugu material.

Meanwhile, MASCOT and the three tiny, hopping rovers — known as Minerva-II-1a, Minerva-II-1b and Minerva-II-2 — will gather a variety of information about the asteroid from its surface. (Minerva-I flew aboard Japan's first asteroid-sampling mission, the original Hayabusa, which returned grains from the space rock Itokawa to Earth in 2010.)

The Hayabusa2 orbiter is scheduled to depart from Ryugu in December 2019. The capsule containing the mission's asteroid samples will come down to Earth a year later, in December 2020.

Hayabusa2 isn't the only asteroid-sampling project underway. NASA's $800 million OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer) mission is on its final approach toward the asteroid Bennu, and should arrive in orbit around the 1,650-foot-wide (500 m) rock this December. OSIRIS-REx's samples are due to land on Earth in September 2023.

Both Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx aim to help scientists better understand asteroid composition and structure, the early history and evolution of the solar system, and the role space rocks may have played in helping life get a start on Earth.

Bringing pristine samples of asteroid material back to Earth will allow researchers to tackle such questions efficiently and effectively, team members from both missions have said. Scientists can perform many more experiments and investigations using well-equipped labs around the world than a robotic probe could conduct all by itself in deep space.",mainstream,M0bd59,flat.earth
1227,"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday called climate change perhaps the world's ""most fearsome"" destructive weapon and mocked those who deny its existence or question its causes, comparing them to people who insist the Earth is flat.

In a speech to Indonesian students, civic leaders and government officials, Kerry tore into climate change skeptics. He accused them of using shoddy science and scientists to delay steps needed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases at the risk of imperiling the planet.

A day earlier, the U.S. and China announced an agreement to cooperate more closely on combating climate change. American officials hope that will help encourage others, including developing countries like Indonesia and India, to follow suit.

China and the United States are the biggest sources of emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that cause the atmosphere to trap solar heat and alter the climate. Scientists say such changes are leading to drought, wildfires, rising sea levels, melting polar ice, plant and animal extinctions and other extreme conditions.

Also in the Jakarta speech, Kerry said everyone and every country must take responsibility for the problem and act immediately.

""We simply don't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the climate conversation,"" he said, referring to what he called ""big companies"" that ""don't want to change and spend a lot of money"" to act to reduce the risks.

Kerry later singled out major oil and coal concerns as the primary offenders.

""We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts,"" Kerry told the audience at a U.S. Embassy-run American Center in a shopping mall.

""Nor should we allow any room for those who think that the costs associated with doing the right thing outweigh the benefits.""

""The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand,"" Kerry said. ""We don't have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society,""

Kerry said the cost of inaction will far outweigh the significant expense of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that trap solar heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the Earth's rising temperatures.

He outlined a litany of recent weather disasters, particularly flooding and typhoons in Asia, and their impact on commerce, agriculture, fishing and daily living conditions for billions of people.

""This city, this country, this region, is really on the front lines of climate change,"" Kerry said. ""It's not an exaggeration to say that your entire way of life here is at risk.""

He added: ""In a sense, climate change can now be considered the world's largest weapon of mass destruction, perhaps even, the world's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.""

The solution, Kerry said, is a new global energy policy that shifts reliance from fossil fuels to cleaner technologies. He noted the President Barack Obama is championing such a shift and encouraged others to appeal to their leaders to join.

The U.S.-China statement issued just after Kerry left Beijing on Saturday said the two countries agreed on steps to carry out commitments to curb greenhouse gases, including reducing vehicle emissions, improving energy efficiency of buildings and other measures.

Beijing and Washington launched a climate change discussion last year, promising progress in five areas: reducing vehicle emissions; advanced electric power grids; capturing and storing carbon emissions; gathering greenhouse gas data; and building efficiency.

Kerry was in Indonesia on the last leg of a three-nation tour of Asia that started in South Korea. After leaving Indonesia on Monday, he planned to visit Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.

Before the climate change speech, Kerry toured Jakarta's Istiqlal Mosque, one of the largest in the world, to pay his respects to Indonesia's Muslim majority population.",mainstream,M13b13,flat.earth
1269,"This week, a particularly odd little bit of pseudoscience reared its head again when rapper B.o.B. took to Twitter and proclaimed that the Earth is flat. Since then, the rapper has drawn the ire of all sorts of incredulous people, including astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.

People have known that the Earth is round since at least the sixth century B.C.E. So many were surprised to hear the flat Earth concept still kicked around. But this wasn't the first resurgance of the idea. Back in the 1970s and ‘80s, a man named Charles Kenneth Johnson became a minor celebrity for his refusal to believe the Earth is round, Cheryl Eddy writes for iO9.

Johnson’s good friend Samuel Shenton founded a small fringe group dubbed the Flat Earth Society in the 1950s. In 1972 Johnson became the president of the society after Shenton's death, transforming the group from a small collection of conspiracy theorists into an organization with thousands of members.

He made waves in the national media and became known for cheerfully insisting the rest of the world was being duped by scientists, Douglas Martin wrote in Johnson’s obituary for the New York Times in 2001.

''If earth were a ball spinning in space, there would be no up or down,'' Johnson told David Gates and Jennifer Smith for Newsweek in 1984. Similarly, Johnson’s wife Marjory believed that the Earth must be flat, because otherwise she would have spent her childhood in her native Australia hanging upside-down by her toes, Martin wrote at the time.

During his tenure as president of the Flat Earth Society, its ranks swelled to about 3,500 people. In his newsletters, Johnson wrote off such spectacles like the sunrise and sunset as optical illusions, discussed how Charles Lindbergh proved the Earth was flat, and claimed that NASA and the moon landing were nothing but hoaxes, Eddy writes.

""You can't orbit a flat earth,"" Johnson told Robert J. Schadewald for Science Digest in 1980. ""The Space Shuttle is a joke—and a very ludicrous joke.""

Ironically, Johnson lived just over the hill from Edwards Air Force Base in southern California—the facility where the Air Force tests experimental aircraft, and where NASA’s Space Shuttles landed after returning to Earth.

While most of the articles about Johnson and his fringe beliefs were written with tongue firmly in cheek, he channeled his odd sort of fame into increasing membership in the Flat Earth Society (as well as a starring role in an ice cream commercial). But it didn’t last: By the time Johnson died, the society had dwindled again to just 100 members.The Flat Earth Society is still around, though they remain little more than a tiny fringe group.

""It is always good to question 'how we know what we know',"" Christine Garwood, author of Flat Earth: The History of an Infamous Idea, tells Brendan O'Neill for the BBC.

1139,"Solar Orbiter will orbit our nearest star, the sun, observing it up close. It will take the first-ever direct images of its poles, while also studying the inner heliosphere—the bubble-like region around the sun created by the stream of energized, charged particles released in the solar wind.

At its closest, Solar Orbiter will come within about 42 million km of the sun: closer than the scorched planet Mercury, just over a quarter of the average distance between Earth and the sun, and closer than any European spacecraft in history.

To get it into this unique orbit at the center of the solar system, edging close to the sun’s poles instead of orbiting in a ‘flat’ plane, like the planets, teams at mission control in Darmstadt, Germany, have planned an intricate path.

Solar Orbiter is due to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on an Atlas V 411 rocket supplied by NASA in early February. Once it has separated from the launch vehicle, a 22- minute automatic activation sequence takes place, after which point the control team takes over the reins for the Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP).

These early moments in the life of a mission are critical. It is now that the spacecraft wakes up, extends its solar arrays and teams on the ground check its health after the rigors of launch.

Elements of Solar Orbiter’s science instruments are located along a 4.4 meter ‘boom,” which keeps them away from the main body of the spacecraft and any potential interference. This boom should be deployed before certain chemical thrusters are fired, which have the potential to contaminate the instruments during maneuvres.

Once Solar Orbiter’s systems and instruments are up and running, it enters into the “cruise phase,” which will last until November 2021. During this time, it will perform two gravity-assist maneuvres around Venus and one around Earth to alter the spacecraft’s trajectory, guiding it towards the innermost regions of the solar system. The first close solar pass will take place at the end of March 2022 at around a third of the distance between Earth and the sun. At this point, the spacecraft will be in an elliptical orbit that initially takes 180 days to complete, making a close approach of the sun every six months. Solar Orbiter’s path will see it travel out of the ‘plane of the ecliptic.” So, instead of orbiting in the same flat plane around the sun as the planets, moons and minor bodies of the solar system, it will ‘leap’ up from the solar equator, delivering views of the sun’s polar regions that have never been seen before. To do this, Solar Orbiter will not travel in a ‘fixed’ orbit. Instead, the spacecraft will follow a constantly changing elliptical path that will be continually tilted and squeezed, edging it higher and higher and closer to the sun’s poles. As such, the spacecraft’s orbit has been chosen to be ‘in resonance’ with Venus, which means that it will return to the planet’s vicinity every few orbits and can again use the planet’s gravity to alter or tilt its orbit. While Solar Orbiter initially orbits in the same ‘flat’ plane as the planets of the solar system, each encounter with Venus will increase its inclination. This means that each time Solar Orbiter encounters the sun, it will be looking at it from a different perspective. By the end of 2021, the spacecraft will reach its first nominal orbit for science, which is set to last for four years. During this time, Solar Orbiter will reach 17° degrees of inclination, allowing the spacecraft to capture high-resolution images of the sun’s poles, for the first time. During its proposed extended mission phase, Solar Orbiter would lift into an even higher inclination orbit. At 33° above the solar equator, the polar regions would come even more directly into view. Data gathered by Solar Orbiter will be stored on the spacecraft, then beamed (or, ‘downlinked’) to Earth during eight-hour communication windows, via the 35 m Malargüe ground station in Argentina. Other Estrack stations such as New Norcia in Australia and Cebreros in Spain will act as backups. To survive getting so up-close and personal with our star, experiencing a maximum temperature of 520 degrees Celsius and receiving a barrage of intense radiation, Solar Orbiter’s main body and vital instruments will be protected by a titanium heat shield that will face the sun at all times. Even the spacecraft’s solar panels, designed to take in energy from the sun, will need to be protected. As Solar Orbiter edges closer to the giant ball of heat and radiation, its panels—sticking out either side of the spacecraft, bringing it to 18.9 m across—will need to tilt away from the sun, limiting the amount of light they take in to ensure they do not overheat.

1213,"My grandfather, Jeffrey Hilliard Launius, was a 75-year-old farmer from southern Illinois at the time of the first moon landing in 1969. He didn’t believe that Americans had landed on the moon. In his estimation such a technological feat was simply not possible. Caught up in the excitement of Apollo 11 that summer, I could not understand my grandfather’s denial. In his insular world, change came grudgingly, however, and a moon landing was certainly a major change. At the time of his death, in 1984, Jeff Launius remained unconvinced.

President Bill Clinton recalled in his 2004 autobiography a similar story of a carpenter he worked with in August 1969, not long after the Apollo 11 landing: “The old carpenter asked me if I really believed it happened. I said sure, I saw it on television. He disagreed; he said that he didn’t believe it for a minute, that “them television fellers” could make things look real that weren’t.”

New York Times science reporter John Noble Wilford remarked in December 1969 that “a few stool-warmers in Chicago bars are on record as suggesting that the Apollo 11 moon walk last July was actually staged by Hollywood on a Nevada desert.” The Atlanta Constitution led a story on June 15, 1970, with “Many skeptics feel moon explorer Neil Armstrong took his ‘giant step for mankind’ somewhere in Arizona.” While poll numbers questioning the moon landing in Detroit, Miami and Akron averaged less than 5 percent, among African-Americans in such places as Washington, D.C., a whopping 54 percent doubted the moon voyages. That perhaps said more about the disconnectedness of minority communities from the Apollo effort and the nation’s overarching racism than anything else. As the story reported, “A woman in Macon said she knows she couldn’t watch a telecast from the moon because her set wouldn’t even pick up New York stations.”

As historian Howard McCurdy opined, “To some, the thrill of space can’t hold a candle to the thrill of conspiracy.” An early and persistent theme has been that as a Cold War measure the United States could not afford to lose the race to the moon, but when failure loomed, NASA faked the landing to save face and national prestige. It used the massive funds dedicated to the effort to “pay off” those who might be persuaded to tell the truth; it also used threats and in some instances criminal actions to stop those who might blow the whistle.

Another common assertion has been that in the latter 1960s, with the U.S. government in disarray because of the debacle of the Vietnam War, the racial crisis in the cities, and social upheaval, the Apollo program proved an ideal, positive distraction from this strife, a convenient conspiracy designed to obscure other issues. One story published in 1970 stated this belief as expressed by an African-American preacher: “It’s all a deliberate effort to mask problems at home,” Newsweek quoted him saying. “The people are unhappy—and this takes their minds off their problems.”

The first conspiracy theorist to make a sustained case for denying that the U.S. landed on the moon was Bill Kaysing, a journalist who had been employed for a few years in the public relations office at Rocketdyne, Inc., a NASA contractor, in the early 1960s. His 1974 pamphlet We Never Went to the Moon laid out many of the major arguments that have been followed by other conspiracy theorists since. His rationale offered poorly developed logic, sloppily analyzed data and sophomorically argued assertions.

Kaysing believed that a failure to land on the moon sprang from the idea that NASA lacked the technical expertise to accomplish the task, requiring the creation of a massive cover-up to hide that fact. He cited as evidence perceived optical anomalies in some imagery from the Apollo program, questioned the physical features of certain objects in the photographs (such as a lack of a star field in the background of lunar surface imagery and a presumed waving of the U.S. flag in an airless environment), and challenged the possibility of NASA astronauts’ surviving a trip to the moon because of radiation exposure.

As John Schwartz wrote of the conspiracy theorists in the New York Times, “They examine photos from the missions for signs of studio fakery, and claim to be able to tell that the American flag was waving in what was supposed to be the vacuum of space. They overstate the health risks of traveling through the radiation belts that girdle our planet; they understate the technological prowess of the American space program; and they cry murder behind every death in the program, linking them to an overall conspiracy.”

Ted Goertzel, a professor of sociology at Rutgers University who has studied conspiracy theorists, told Schwartz that “there’s a similar kind of logic behind all of these groups.” For the most part, he explained, “They don’t undertake to prove that their view is true” so much as to “find flaws in what the other side is saying.” And so, he said, argument is a matter of accumulation instead of persuasion. “They feel if they’ve got more facts than the other side, that proves they’re right.”

Kaysing insisted, without any evidence whatsoever, that even though the Soviet Union was watching the American effort closely, it was easier to successfully fake it than actually to land on the moon. He even speculated that the chance of landing successfully on the moon stood at 0.017; on what this calculation was based is a mystery and does not square with NASA estimates at the time, which stood at approximately 87 percent for at least one successful landing before the end of the 1960s.

Some moon-landing deniers concede that there were robotic missions to the moon, but that the human Apollo landings were faked. Professional moon-landing denier Bart Sibrel has asserted that Apollo spacecraft crews had faked their orbit around the moon and their walk on its surface by using trick photography, but did accept Earth orbital missions. Humans could not go to the moon, Sibrel and deniers of his ilk claim, because going beyond the Van Allen radiation belts would have given them lethal doses of cosmic radiation. While there is indeed radiation both in the Van Allen belts and beyond, and radiation’s risks to human health are real, contentions that it would not be survivable are nonsense, and almost no papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals make this claim. A few conspiracy theorists in this category even allow that NASA landed robotically on the moon various passive reflector mirrors used for laser ranging and other human-made objects to bamboozle the public.

Then, there are those who believe that humans went to the moon, but did so with the assistance of extraterrestrial visitors—or that Apollo astronauts discovered extra-terrestrial life there. These claims ranged from gravitational anomalies to alien artifacts to alien encounters. Accordingly, this brand of conspiracy theorist claims that NASA covered up what had been found, in the manner of the discovery of a monolith at Clavius Crater on the Moon in 2001: A Space Odyssey.

Conspiracy theorist Richard Hoagland has asserted for many years that the Apollo program discovered large artificial glass structures on the lunar surface that has been kept from the public. Besides other conventions common in a cover-up, Hoagland made the claim that the astronauts that went to the moon had been hypnotized and any memories of extraterrestrial encounters were removed. Most interestingly, Hoagland has argued that NASA deviously orchestrated the origins of the moon-landing denials as a disinformation campaign to mask the discovery of extra-terrestrial structures on the lunar surface. In 2009, he asserted that the water molecules that NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter had discovered on the Moon had been leaked from buried extraterrestrial cities. No evidence supported these assertions.

While the various claims of the moon-landing deniers have evolved over time, their reasons for making these claims have rested on several types of “evidence.” The most significant are anomalies found in photographs or, to a much lesser degree, movies taken on the missions. Imagery has played a critical role in the communication of the experience. While Apollo imagery documented in graphic detail what took place on the moon, the use of that same imagery to raise questions about the entire enterprise is an irony too great to ignore.

Some 25 images have been invoked in such claims. These include images that do not show stars in the background, despite conspiracy theorists’ insistence that they should be clearly seen; the fact that dust was not present on the landing pads of the spacecraft; the assertion that shadows and lighting on the moon are uneven and counterintuitive to the photographs in which they are seen; that flags seem to be blowing in a breeze although there is no wind on the moon; that some rocks appear to have propmaster marks on them; and that Réseau-plate crosshairs sometimes seem to disappear behind objects in an image. For each of these charges, there are completely reasonable, understandable, and convincing explanations, most relating to the nature of photography and the vicissitudes of shadows, lighting and exposure of film in a vacuum. Few moon-landing deniers, however, will accept any explanation whatsoever. I have personally had one say to me, “Regardless of whatever you might say, I will never believe that humans have landed on the moon.”

Deniers of the moon landing also point to anomalies in the historical record to cast doubt on the NASA account of the Apollo program. One of the persistent beliefs is that the “blueprints” for the Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V rocket have been lost, or perhaps they never existed. This is simply untrue. The National Archives and Records Administration maintains a regional Federal Records Center at Ellenwood, Georgia, just outside of Atlanta, where the records from the Marshall Space Flight Center are housed. Those records include more than 2,900 linear feet of Saturn V records, including drawings and schematics. A similar story about the loss of the original broadcast video from the Apollo 11 landing has been used to cast doubt on the whole endeavor, causing NASA to undertake an unprecedented search for the tapes, finding some but not all that were missing.

Finally, in this same category of anomalies in the historical record, conspiracy theorists have scrutinized every word uttered by the Apollo astronauts over the years to try to catch them in some statement that might be interpreted as denying the landings. Having found none, some have resorted to selectively excerpting them and in some cases to making them up altogether. Bart Sibrel commented, “Neil Armstrong, the first man to supposedly walk on the moon, refuses to give interviews to anyone on the subject. ‘Ask me no questions, and I’ll tell you no lies.’ Collins also refuses to be interviewed. Aldrin, who granted an interview, threatened to sue us if we showed it to anyone.” Sibrel’s implication is the astronauts have something to hide.

Sibrel has gone further, accosting astronauts and demanding that they swear on the Bible that they walked on the moon. Some have done so; others refuse to engage him.

In one incident on September 9, 2002, Sibrel confronted Buzz Aldrin at a Los Angeles hotel and called him a “liar, a thief, and a coward.” At that point Aldrin, then 72 years old, hit Sibrel with a right hook that sent him to his knees. While Sibrel pressed charges, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office declined to pursue the incident. Most people who viewed video of this altercation expressed concern that Aldrin might have hurt his hand.

In a truly bizarre turn of events, on August 31, 2009, near the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing, the satirical publication The Onion published a story entitled “Conspiracy Theorist Convinces Neil Armstrong Moon Landing Was Faked.” The story had worldwide implications, as it was published as true in several newspapers. Two Bangladeshi newspapers, the Daily Manab Zamin and New Nation, apologized afterward for reporting it as fact. It is bad enough when conspiracy theorists state such things without foundation; these then get picked up and broadcast by individuals, but when legitimate news organizations do so it is much more disturbing. As one commentator about this incident suggested, “Their excuse: ‘We thought it was true so we printed it without checking.’”

Throughout the latter third of the 20th century and into the 21st, with public confidence in the U.S. government declining because of Vietnam, Watergate and other scandals and malfeasance, it became somewhat easier for people to believe the worst. There has been considerable research on the parts of society that embrace conspiracy theories of all types. Arguing that conspiracism writ large represents a fundamental part of the political system, legal scholar Mark Fenster argues that at sum, denials of the moon landings bring to the fore “a polarization so profound that people end up with an unshakable belief that those in power ‘simply can’t be trusted.’”

During a fall 2009 trip to Vladivostok, Russia, I gave four presentations about the moon landings to university students. In every case, the first question from the students was about challenges to the moon-landing account made by conspiracy theorists. All of them channeled the standard criticisms of Apollo made by denialists over the years.

A radio talk show host, Rob McConnell, declared that listeners to his show The X Zone, offered astounding responses to two questions—“Do you believe in ghosts, and did American astronauts really walk on the Moon?”—77 percent of respondents said yes to belief in ghosts, and 93 percent said that they did not believe that the Moon landings had actually occurred. As Seth Shostak from the SETI Institute remarked about this, “The respondents believe in ghosts, but do not think NASA put people on the moon. On the one hand, you have uncorroborated testimony about noises in the attic. On the other, you have a decade of effort by tens of thousands of engineers and scientists, endless rocket hardware, thousands of photos, and 378 kilograms (840 pounds) of moon rock.”

Shostak was befuddled by this reality of modern American society. Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt was more philosophical. “If people decide they’re going to deny the facts of history and the facts of science and technology,” he said, “there’s not much you can do with them. For most of them, I just feel sorry that we failed in their education.”

There can be no question that the February 2001 airing of the Fox television special Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon? changed the nature of the debate. In this instance, a major network presented a conspiracy scenario without any serious rebuttal that might have been offered. As USA Today reported: “According to Fox and its respectfully interviewed “experts”—a constellation of ludicrously marginal and utterly uncredentialed ‘investigative journalists’—the U.S. grew so eager to defeat the Soviets in the intensely competitive 1960s space race that it faked all six Apollo missions that purportedly landed on the moon. Instead of exploring the lunar surface, the American astronauts only tromped around a crude movie set that was created by the plotters in the legendary Area 51 of the Nevada desert.”

While the program claimed to “let the viewer decide” about the validity of the claims for denial of the moon landings, it made no attempt whatsoever to offer point and counterpoint, thereby giving the viewers a seriously biased view of the issue and skewed evidence in favor of a hoax.

The most egregious violation of propriety came in the Fox show when conspiracy theorists claimed that ten astronauts and two civilians had died “under mysterious circumstances” during the Apollo program. The ten astronauts in question included the three who were killed in the Apollo 1 fire of January 27, 1967, when their capsule was consumed in a flash fire during ground tests. At one point, Scott Grissom, son of Apollo 1 mission commander Gus Grissom, who was killed in the incident, claimed, “My father’s death was no accident. He was murdered.” At another point, however, he retracted that statement and declared that “NASA didn’t murder anyone.”

No question, shoddy workmanship and poor procedures led to those astronauts’ deaths, and it was a tragic loss. But the deaths of Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee were an accident and not murder. Some moon-landing deniers have claimed that NASA had them killed because Grissom was on the verge of exposing the Apollo program as a fraud. There is not one scintilla of evidence to support this accusation. The identity of the remaining seven astronauts presumably “murdered” by NASA during Apollo is something of a mystery.

To be sure, astronaut Ed Givens died in an automobile accident, and astronauts Ted Freeman, C. C. Williams, Elliot See and Charlie Bassett died in aircraft accidents, but these were far removed from the conduct of Project Apollo. This accounts for eight astronauts, but those making this claim also apparently count as astronauts two other pilots who had nothing to do with the moon-landing program, X-15 pilot Mike Adams and Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory pilot Robert Lawrence. Finally, they claimed that NASA technician Thomas Baron and another NASA civilian, who was unnamed, were murdered to keep the secret of the moon hoax. None of these claims was founded on any credible evidence.

The Fox program fueled an explosion in conspiracy theories about the Moon landings and the audience for them. I was inundated with questions from friends and acquaintances—many of whom I thought were smarter than that—asking me to explain why the photos showed no stars and why the flag moved. It got to be tiring, and unfortunately it changed my opinion that most people aren’t so easily duped. They are.

Two scientists who have argued against the value of human spaceflight even came forward to counter the Fox special’s charges. Robert Park, director of the Washington office of the American Physical Society, dismissed the “documentary” with this statement: “The body of physical evidence that humans did walk on the Moon is simply overwhelming.” Marc Norman at the University of Tasmania added, “Fox should stick to making cartoons. I’m a big fan of ‘The Simpsons’!”

As folklorist Linda Degh noted, “The mass media catapult these half-truths into a kind of twilight zone where people can make their guesses sound as truths. Mass media have a terrible impact on people who lack guidance.” Without a proper rebuttal available from NASA—the agency had an official position before of not responding to what it considered absurd claims—many young people publicly began to question the Apollo landings. Several astronauts stepped forward to affirm the legitimacy of the program, but others thought the charges too silly even to warrant response. Many debated the issues in the emerging world of the Internet. Indeed, the internet became a haven for conspiracy theorists of all stripes, and with the barrier for publication online so low anyone could put up any page they wished with any assertions they wished to make. A search of the term “moon hoax” recently yielded no fewer than 6,000 sites.

NASA had refrained from officially responding to these charges—avoiding anything that might dignify the claims—the Fox show required that it change its approach. After the Fox program first aired, NASA released a one-paragraph press release titled, “Apollo: Yes, We Did.”

650,"A Goa police officer on Tuesday compared himself to 15th century Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei after being targeted for the strict enforcement of the rule mandating the wearing of helmets.

""You may not believe in wearing a helmet... But there was a fellow named Galileo. Everyone (then) used to believe that the Sun rotates around the Earth. When he said Earth moves around the Sun, everyone abused him. Finally he was sent to prison. Galileo said, 'I will prove it with a telescope'. People still did not believe him and he died in jail,"" Goa Director General of Police (DGP) Muktesh Chander said while making an appeal during a presentation on road safety.

""Today, I am telling you that a helmet is necessary. I showed you a (helmet) demo too. You can try the demo at home, with a melon. If you still do not understand, then what can I do?""

Mr Chander added that those who do not want to follow traffic rules should sign organ donation forms so that their organs can be harvested in case they meet with a fatal accident.

He said that those who do not believe in wearing helmets should join conspiracy theory groups like the ""Flat Earth Society"", whose members, he said, continue to believe the Earth is flat.

An unprecedented crackdown on traffic violators as well as a unique 'Traffic Sentinel Scheme' launched by the Goa Police last year, which rewards citizens monetarily for photographing traffic violations, was criticised by both the ruling as well as the opposition legislators in the recently concluded budget session of the state Assembly.

Under pressure, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government has promised a review of the controversial scheme.

Mr Chander, however, maintains that due to the strict enforcement of traffic norms, road accident deaths have decreased, adding that the traffic police was not to be blamed for the drop in tourism as claimed by the industry stakeholders.

""There is no law which says tourists are allowed all violations in Goa. They are also supposed to observe traffic laws. But the moment we start implementing this in a serious way, the whole tourism sector appears to have collapsed on our head,"" he said.",mainstream,M0a53a,flat.earth
51,"Organizations concerned about our waste of natural capital are gathering for a large summit in Bonn this weekend, amid tough times for the sustainability agenda.

This year's focus will be on volunteer's role in shaping sustainable societies.

""NGOs and responsive citizens – the people – act at the heart of societies,"" said the head of the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) program, Faliva Pansieri. ""Sustainability and human well-being are finally coming to center stage.""

Bonn, the former German capital, is an appropriate venue for the conference, which is expecting some 2,200 participants.

Although no longer the seat of the German parliament, the city on the Rhine is now home to 18 UN organizations, which work mainly in the field of sustainable development. In addition, about 170 UN-affiliated NGOs are based in Bonn.

""This year, the platform is on the subject of changing our lifestyles, our economic models, our social organization and political life so that we can connect the dots between climate change, water, energy and food,"" said Maria-Luisa Chavez, the UN's Chief of NGO Relations.

The origins of non-governmental, non-profit organizations go back to the 19th century when the first anti-slavery groups were founded. Since then, the number of NGOs has skyrocketed.

They are especially active in the fields of environmental protection, social justice, human rights and humanitarian aid.

But in recent years - between food crises, economic doldrums and a range of conflicts around the world - NGOs concerned about how rapidly we are wasting our natural capital are having a tough time getting their message across.

Problems like climate change, desertification, resource-use and the loss of species have only grown more acute since the 1992 ""Earth Summit,"" which first saw NGOs invited to take part in UN discussions to tackle these problems.

From Rio to Bonn and back

The Earth Summit, which debuted in Rio de Janeiro, will be held for the 20th time next year and preparations for Rio+20 are high on the agenda in Bonn this weekend.

""Sustainable development and environment at the moment are not having a good time,"" said Felix Dodds, executive director of the Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future, and the conference chairman.

""I think that may well get worse unless we make sure that Rio in 2012 gives us a new road map to sustainable development.""

He said if governments had delivered on the commitments they made in the past then we would already be on a road to sustainable development.

""Those are now broken promises and broken promises have to stop,"" he added.

Things have changed since 1992, Dodds said, and priorities have shifted.

Today issues like climate change, the connection between the environment and security, and access to food, water and energy have gained new urgency.

In addition, consumer behavior in industrialized countries has widened the gap between the developed and developing world. But the gap between the wealthy and the struggling within the Western world has also grown.

Fro Bernward Geier, former director of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), the time for action is now. Today he is the coordinator of the German NGOs at the conference – 20 years ago he was an enthusiastic participant at the Rio summit.

He said he's seen ""too much rhetoric and too little action"" over the years and says Rio 2012 is the last chance to really put a program into action before it is too late.

""When I consider the momentum we have here in Bonn and see how the German NGO community, which is normally pretty critical of the UN, is getting excited, I feel a little flicker of hope,"" he said.

""We have global problems and we have to find solutions in a global context and then put them into practice on the local and regional level.""

Some have been critical of the number of conferences that are held on development and the environment, saying it has led to a sort of meeting fatigue. But Felix Dodd counters that, saying that only conferences that don't bring results result in annoyance and weariness.

""Rio will not be a fatigue conference, it will be a successful one,"" he said. ""And so as we are going to have a successful one, the general public and politicians will see it as an important one.""",mainstream,M17140,flat.earth

 Landsat’s Most Historically Significant Images 

 Earth as Art: Stunning Images From SpaceImages of Earth from space give us a different, often enlightening and even inspirational view of our planet. The USGS and NASA have taken some of the more interesting images from the Landsat satellites and added some false color, digitally produced by sensors on the satellites, to accentuate different features and create some truly beautiful works of art. The first Landsat satellite was launched on July 23, 1972. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Landsat mission, the public was given the difficult task of choosing the best of the more than 120 images in the Earth as Art collection. The top five selections, based on more than 14,000 votes, are featured here in descending order (above: first place). Your challenge is to select just one of these incredible images for your computer desktop.

554,"A GROUP of conspiracy theorists who believe the earth is flat tried to explain away the solar eclipse, with some claiming it is a hologram projected into the sky by NASA.

Flat-earthers believe the earth sits underneath a giant dome as the sun and the moon travel above.

While some think their theory successfully explains the solar eclipse, others have taken to social media trying to persuade people the natural phenomenon is a hoax made up by institutes such as NASA.

Many proclaimed the eclipse was simply a hologram projected into the sky to fool people into believing in a globe.

One Twitter user wrote: ""If eclipses are real, why do you need special glasses to see them.

""Throw away your NASA CGI Glasses. Expose the lies.""

Another wrote: ""Today's eclipse was a government-made light projected into the atmosphere of the flat earth plane, these roundheads need to accept the truth.""

One concerned wife wrote on a Facebook page: ""Is it safe to look at the solar eclipse when you believe in a flat earth? My husband is a flat earther and is going to look at the eclipse in a little over an hour. Is this safe?""

Another replied: ""Its perfectly safe. The whole thing is a NASA hologram.""

A Twitter user wrote: ""Remember, NASA doesn't want you to look at the eclipse because it proves Flat Earth. Stand with me and other #FlatEarthers and stare directly.""

Looking directly at a solar eclipse is dangerous and could burn the retina, causing short-term blindness or permanent damage to the eye.

Eclipse glasses can block almost all the harmful rays during the natural phenomenon.

Others who were curious about the strange theory flocked to the Flat Earth Society's Twitter page to bombard the group with questions.

According to the society, which was founded in 1956 by Samuel Shenton, an eclipse can happen even if the world is flat.

They claim to believe the world is flat due to ""evidence-based inquiry"" on Earth.

In a rather bemused tweet, they said: ""We're getting *so many* questions about the eclipse. Apparently round earthers are really struggling with this one.""

The idea that the world is flat was the dominant theory from ancient times until the Rennaissance, when Magellan successfully sailed around the world.

Since the 16th century, flat earth theory has been in decline and is considered a pseudoscience.

175,"Even the minisuperspace calculation is hard to solve exactly, but physicists know there are two possible expansion histories that potentially dominate the calculation. These rival universe shapes anchor the two sides of the current debate.

The rival solutions are the two “classical” expansion histories that a universe can have. Following an initial spurt of cosmic inflation from size zero, these universes steadily expand according to Einstein’s theory of gravity and space-time. Weirder expansion histories, like football-shaped universes or caterpillar-like ones, mostly cancel out in the quantum calculation.

One of the two classical solutions resembles our universe. On large scales, it’s smooth and randomly dappled with energy, due to quantum fluctuations during inflation. As in the real universe, density differences between regions form a bell curve around zero. If this possible solution does indeed dominate the wave function for minisuperspace, it becomes plausible to imagine that a far more detailed and exact version of the no-boundary wave function might serve as a viable cosmological model of the real universe.

The other potentially dominant universe shape is nothing like reality. As it widens, the energy infusing it varies more and more extremely, creating enormous density differences from one place to the next that gravity steadily worsens. Density variations form an inverted bell curve, where differences between regions approach not zero, but infinity. If this is the dominant term in the no-boundary wave function for minisuperspace, then the Hartle-Hawking proposal would seem to be wrong.

The two dominant expansion histories present a choice in how the path integral should be done. If the dominant histories are two locations on a map, megacities in the realm of all possible quantum mechanical universes, the question is which path we should take through the terrain. Which dominant expansion history, and there can only be one, should our “contour of integration” pick up? Researchers have forked down different paths.

In their 2017 paper, Turok, Feldbrugge and Lehners took a path through the garden of possible expansion histories that led to the second dominant solution. In their view, the only sensible contour is one that scans through real values (as opposed to imaginary values, which involve the square roots of negative numbers) for a variable called “lapse.” Lapse is essentially the height of each possible shuttlecock universe—the distance it takes to reach a certain diameter. Lacking a causal element, lapse is not quite our usual notion of time. Yet Turok and colleagues argue partly on the grounds of causality that only real values of lapse make physical sense. And summing over universes with real values of lapse leads to the wildly fluctuating, physically nonsensical solution.

“People place huge faith in Stephen’s intuition,” Turok said by phone. “For good reason—I mean, he probably had the best intuition of anyone on these topics. But he wasn’t always right.”

Jonathan Halliwell, a physicist at Imperial College London, has studied the no-boundary proposal since he was Hawking’s student in the 1980s. He and Hartle analyzed the issue of the contour of integration in 1990. In their view, as well as Hertog’s, and apparently Hawking’s, the contour is not fundamental, but rather a mathematical tool that can be placed to greatest advantage. It’s similar to how the trajectory of a planet around the sun can be expressed mathematically as a series of angles, as a series of times, or in terms of any of several other convenient parameters. “You can do that parameterization in many different ways, but none of them are any more physical than another one,” Halliwell said.

He and his colleagues argue that, in the minisuperspace case, only contours that pick up the good expansion history make sense. Quantum mechanics requires probabilities to add to 1, or be “normalizable,” but the wildly fluctuating universe that Turok’s team landed on is not. That solution is nonsensical, plagued by infinities and disallowed by quantum laws—obvious signs, according to no-boundary’s defenders, to walk the other way.

It’s true that contours passing through the good solution sum up possible universes with imaginary values for their lapse variables. But apart from Turok and company, few people think that’s a problem. Imaginary numbers pervade quantum mechanics. To team Hartle-Hawking, the critics are invoking a false notion of causality in demanding that lapse be real. “That’s a principle which is not written in the stars, and which we profoundly disagree with,” Hertog said.",mainstream,M116e1,flat.earth

970,"So where do we go when we die? I guess this is the question we all want the answer to, and indeed we should.

Because inner-standing the vastness and complexity to this Matrix construct and how it operates can only serve to shield and protect ourselves when we do inevitably reach that point.

What I am talking about in this blog is based upon years of research, you can take it or leave it. I am not attempting to force this upon people merely putting out that of which deeply resonates as truth.

The fact is humanity is involved in a soul harvesting trap, I have written about this extensively previously in other blogs. It has been sold to us through ancient indoctrination as simply ‘reincarnation’ a method whereby you can come back and ‘resolve’ any outstanding karma on this Planet.

This is a falsehood, we have been deceived and tricked and it has been going on for many many years. What is happening is that we are being lured and tricked by the false white light and deceivers acting as benevolent beings, who are essentially there to just hook as back into coming back down for another dose on Planet crazy. Let me explain further.

The whole after death experience is nothing more than an AI simulation. As you die you will see a tunnel filled with white light, you may feel immediately drawn to it as there is a familiarity due to what you may have read or heard about in your physical life.

We must remember that ignorance doesn’t die when we die, thats why its so important to seek knowledge in your physical life, do your own research, and not be drawn into the many traps and deceptions put out there by the Matrix agents in this dimension, those in government, mainstream media, and so on.

So the white light is the first deception, once you enter the white light you will be met with false white light beings. These beings may masquerade as whatever you admired in your physical life, maybe some kind of deity, Jesus, Buddha or even a close family member. These beings know us intimately and know our blind spots and the ways in which to appeal to our emotions.

From there you are taken for a life review whereby you are shown perhaps certain times in your life where you may have hurt someone or made a mistake, they will play on your guilt and emotions once again, and also deceive us into volunteering to come back down to Earth by promising that we can come back to ‘resolve our karma’.

In reality all that is happening is that we are being sent back down to have our energy siphoned again for interdimensionals, entities, and parasitic government agencies. We are the food they need to feed on, and hence they need us back down on the feeding ground.

Most humans will volunteer quite easily, although most don’t really want to come back down. This is due to ignorance or fear of not ending up in some kind of ‘heaven’s they don’t resolve their karma.

Some human souls are so tired they go to a kind of resting area before they have their memories wiped and are sent back down into another human body. And so the cycle begins again.

So how can we escape this soul trap and where do we go?

Well, first of all awareness is key, just even knowing that this entrapment construct exists is empowering in and of itself.

There have been a few theories put forward about what to do and where to go. The murdered Max Spiers often spoke about going into your heart space.

It is my inner-standing that there is a type of grid around this Earth, now this isn’t the place to discuss whether the Earth is flat or round lets put that aside for one second, although there is no way I beLIEve NASA and the photos that they put out!

This grid, or maybe even what is depicted as a dome in many films, is holding this Matrix construct together so people cannot leave and remain entrapped here.

What has happened over the last few decades however, is that as people start to become more consciously aware and start to ‘wake up’ it is creating holes in this grid. Everything we see in terms of our own solar system is a holographic projection WITHIN this grid.

Its not to say that these Planets don’t exist, its just that they are within this Matrix grid.

Outside the grid it where the REAL freedom and expansiveness of space lies, a place where we can travel instantly through thought alone, unlike here where we are bound by the constructs of this artificial construct.

As I talk about in my blog below, there is a way out and it involves being strong willed when you leave your physical body. Clearly its not a good idea to go to the false white light, nor is it wise to stop and talk to any beings no matter how ‘friendly’ they might show themselves to be.

The idea is, by using thought (as you won’t have your physical body anymore) is to head for the grid, and in particular one of these holes that I spoke about previously.

As the Planet rises in consciousness I estimate that there will be more and more of these holes in the grid. Bypass everything else and navigate your way through, do this without fear as we are always creating through our thoughts.

As you navigate through the same thing applies, use discernment when making decisions and interacting with any beings. Chances are there will be many more benevolent forms of consciousnesses in that realm than within the grid but its still good practice to discern. From there you’re free to explore as your consciousness wants to.

1178,"Millions of people around the globe gathered on the internet to watch in awe SpaceX’s live stream of the rocket blasting off from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida at 3.45pm EST (8.45pm GMT). Thousands more gathered at the Cape Canaveral space centre yesterday, joyously counting down the seconds until the rocket sent a Tesla Roadster on a billion year journey through space. But droves of skeptics and disbelievers immediately took to social media platforms to voice their concerns and accuse SpaceX of faking the whole operation. Flat Earthers, who are individuals who cling on to the disproven theory that the Earth is a flat disk and not an oblate sphere, claimed the stream was CGI.

The official Flat Earth Society Twitter page said today: “People who believe that the Earth is a globe because ‘they saw a car in space on the Internet’ must be the new incarnation of ‘It's true, I saw it on TV!’ “It's a poor argument. Why would we believe any privately-held company to report the truth?” The group further agued the media were in on SpaceX’s agenda, helping out the rocket manufacturer with the alleged deception. The society added in response to a challenger: “You shouldn't trust us. You should evaluate claims independently. We've never advocated for anything else.”

Another Twitter user under the handle of Forever Flat, said: “For all of you, who watched the Falcon Heavy. Saw a car go to space, saw NO satellites, NO ISS, NO space debris, NO oblate spheroid, NO spinning Earth, NO escape velocity, NO speeds of 20kmph, NO stars, just stationary blackness.”

SpaceX founder Elon Musk, entertained the Flat Earthers in a post-launch interview. Mr Musk joked the car looked too “weird, too crisp” to be real. Mr Musk said: ""You can tell it’s real because it looks so fake. ""It’s just literally a normal car in space, which I kind of like the absurdity of that."" Those who watched the SpaceX feed saw the expensive electric car breathtakingly hang over the blue planet below, immediately disproving conspiracies the Earth is anything but a globe.

From its vantage point thousands of kilometres above the Earth, Mr Musk admitted watching the Roadster and its dummy Starman pilot in real time was a “surreal” experience. You can watch the recorded SpaceX feed in full here: SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch live stream But not everyone was convinced by the stream. Many truthers questioned the apparent lack of stars against vast expanse of space, while others pointed out the planet appeared to be stationary. Twitter account Prof Brian Hoax tweeted: “Surely, you don't need to be a flat Earth believer to recognise the fakery. “Its not a flat Earth vs globe matter, its exposure of the fraud and mockery. This affects us all.”

Unfortunately the flat earth theory is supported by many prominent celebrities such as raper B.o.B., cricketer Freddie Flintoff and NBA star Kyrie Irving. The same people believe NASA and other respected scientific bodies are perpetuating the “globe hoax” for their own ends. B.o.B challenged NASA last year by pledging to send a satellite into space to settle the debate.

54,"Katy Perry’s “Dark Horse” is a fun and colorful video taking place in Ancient Egypt. However, behind the cartoonish style of the video, viewers are exposed to a great deal of symbolism of the occult elite and messages regarding its power. We’ll look at the symbolism of “Dark Horse”.

Katy Perry is a gigantic pop star, mainly because her songs and videos appeal to teens and pre-teens while her sex-appeal captures the attention of the older crowd. This makes her a perfect tool to be used by the elite to communicate its messages and, as seen in previous articles about her, her songs and videos are fully used for that purpose. Dark Horse, however, is on a whole other level. It is pure, relentless, in-your-face Illuminati symbolism, interlaced with references to the elite’s brand of black magic and mind control. Playing the role of “Katy-Patra”, an Egyptian pharaoh reminiscent of ancient sex symbol Cleopatra, Katy Perry rules over her subjects the same way the occult elite rules over the world.

In my article on the 2014 Grammy Awards, I described Katy Perry’s performance of Dark Horse as a black magick ritual disguised as a music performance. The video goes straight to the roots of this sorcery: Egyptian Black Magick, the original source that is tapped into by today’s dark secret societies.

Before we look at the actual video, let’s look at its trailer, which contains a few interesting elements.

Then the trailer states that Kings would travel from “Brooklyn to Babylon” to meet her. Babylon, which was a real ancient metropolis located where Iraq is today, was ruled by various ancient empires and has long been an epicenter of the elite’s black magic.

Let’s look at the video.

Dark Horse takes place in a colorful, child-friendly version of Ancient Egypt that’s been “hip-hop-ized” about 15% to appeal to its target audience. Katy Perry plays the role of an evil, greedy, egotistical, despotic pharaoh named Katy-Patra who destroys men for their belongings. What a great lesson for girls under the age of 14. In a wider sense, Katy-Patra’s rule represents the occult elite taking resources and power from nations (represented by the kings). What a great lesson for the rest of the world.

Throughout the video, it is firmly established that Katy-Patra is an evil tyrant using black magic to control and destroy people while having a bunch of kitten slaves at her feet. Kind of like what the occult elite does. And of course, there are all kinds of blatant symbols that show her to be a representative of the Illuminati.

The above scenes tell plenty about the occult-elite influenced mythology of the video. Katy-Patra is looked upon by Anubis, the jackal-headed god of death, probably because she likes to kill people. Behind her is the falcon-headed god Horus wearing gold chains (to make him look “cool” to young, impressionable viewers). Notice that he only has one eye – a reference, once again, to the All-Seeing Eye of Horus. More importantly, Katy-Patra is surrounded by a golden snake, which probably refers to the evil Egyptian god Apep.

Three 6 Mafia rapper Juicy J makes an appearance in the video and his entrance is pretty darn symbolic too. He literally emerges from some kind sarcophagus, which features the occult elite’s favorite symbol in lieu of eyes: The Eye of Horus inside a triangle.

On top of all of that symbolism, we must never forget another part of the Agenda: Exposing young people to hyper-sexualization.

The video is essentially about kings from other nations trying to wow Katy-Patra with amazing gifts. The first suitor offers her a gigantic diamond.

Katy-Patra immediately orders her kitten slaves to snatch that diamond from the suitor.

The above image is symbolic for a few reasons: First, it tells the viewers that Katy-Patra plays the role of the occult elite in the video. Second, she CANNOT see through the Eye (it is opaque). She instead sees the diamond through the elite’s “eyes”, which are focused on greed, power, and material possessions. Finally, children who watch music videos need to be exposed to that one-eye sign all the time.

I could stop the video analysis here. What else do you truly need to know about the video? Katy Perry is looking at a big diamond using an Eye of Horus to hide one eye. This scene is a 100% continuation of about everything I’ve ever talked about on this site. And there it is again, right in our faces, in one of the world’s most popular videos. Really, how can anyone think that all this symbolism is “just a coincidence”? Anyhow, back to the video.

The next suitor tries to entice Katy-Patra’s gluttony by offering her food.

Of course, things do not turn out great for that guy, either.

The last suitor brings what Katy-Patra really wants: Power.

Seeing this pyramid, Katy-Patra gets very excited because that’s what she, and the elite, truly wants: Unlimited occult power over the world. The illuminated pyramid essentially represents the Illuminati’s high-tech control over the world.

When Katy-Patra steps on top of the unfinished pyramid, she becomes imbued with crazy magical powers. She even grows wings.

The video ends with Katy-Patra becoming a super-Illuminati pharaoh … and everyone bows down to her … and the suitor turns into a chihuahua. The moral of the video? Illuminati.

It is rather hard to believe that all of this Illuminati symbolism was packed into a video that only lasts 3 minutes and 40 seconds. It is even harder to believe that some people still cannot see the obvious pattern of symbols found in mass media that transcends artists, music genres, and even media outlets. Far from being random, these symbols have been used for centuries to represent the occult elite and they are now all over the place.

More than just flashing symbols, the video Dark Horse tells a darker story: the occult elite’s insatiable greed for ultimate power while dismissing the petty rulers operating underneath it. Katy-Patra indeed takes resources from various kings of the world and then destroys them. In the end, she climbs on an Illuminati pyramid and turns into an unstoppable pharaoh imbued with magical powers. Could the brainwashing be more obvious?

In short, Dark Horse is Illuminati propaganda aimed at children, using bright colors and catchy hooks to subliminally teach them who rules the world and who controls the idols that they love and emulate. Of course, none of this is clearly spelled out. Instead, it comes at you through symbolism … like a dark horse.",conspiracy,C001ec,flat.earth; illuminati
881,"When he first heard about the idea of a flat Earth Robbie Davidson thought the notion that the world was not a sphere was crazy.

“I thought the idea of a flat Earth was ridiculous,” said Robbie Davidson, a slim, hyper Canadian sporting a ginger goatee and loose fitting suit while sitting in the lobby of a Denver hotel.

But not any more. The hotel is hosting the second annual Flat Earth International Conference – an event that Davidson himself founded and organized.

“I’d first heard it in the Bible and thought ‘this can’t be true,’” he recalled, speaking with rapid excitement. “I mean, I believed everything else, that the Earth was created in six literal days, but what about all this other stuff [about a flat Earth]? To be consistent as a biblical literalist, I can’t pick and choose.”

David’s conversion to believing in a flat earth was only a few years ago, yet in that time he and scores of others around the globe – including a few celebrities – have subscribed to the idea that the Earth is shaped like a pancake.

The theories splinter off from there, with varying ideas about who is propagating misinformation about the Earth’s shape and why, but there are a number of unifying touchstones: Nasa, Freemasons, the “faked” moon landing, globalists, Elon Musk.

But perhaps the most common thread is the Bible, and the conviction of its fundamental truth. That makes evangelical Christians one of largest and most enthusiastic groups who embrace the theory, but they are also one of the least reported on and one that causes immense controversy in their own community.

Yet walking the halls of the conference – where 650 people from around the world paid up to $350 to attend lectures about their horizontal idea of the planet – it’s not uncommon to see people praying over one another, discussing apocalyptic theories about “end times”, or swapping Bible verses that describe the Earth in a non-spherical fashion.

“I’ve found over 200 scriptures that corroborate the idea that we are living on a stationary, flat Earth,” said Nathan Roberts, one of many “cosmological evangelists” speaking at the event.

He’s a handsome, young entrepreneur, traveling the country with his wife and kids, speaking about Jesus and selling books about creationism – the perfect model of an American evangelical. And yet most evangelicals, like most scientists, despise the work that he does on a flat Earth.

“The most persecution I’ve faced has been from within the church,” Roberts said.

At a time when evangelicals are facing somewhat of a public relations crisis–backlash against their LGBT stance, prosperity doctrines and overwhelming support of the Trump 2016 campaign, observers say it makes sense they would bristle at any associations with the flat Earth movement.

Throughout the last century, evangelicals have had a love-hate relationship with fundamentalist Christians, who are an evangelical subculture who see the Bible as a historical, scientifically factual account of world events.

Mainstream evangelicals tend to employ what’s known as “seeker sensitive” tactics of neutral politics, live rock music and charming, hip pastors, attracting celebrities like Chris Pratt, Justin Bieber and Kim Kardashian. Whereas fundamentalist Christians are typically less frills and more idealism, often leading to homeschooling, survivalist lifestyles, and a focus on the Book of Revelation.

Flat Earthers (or “biblical Earthers,” as some distinguish themselves at this conference) are a new subculture of American fundamentalist Christianity. It’s a marriage of anti-government conspiracy theories (Nasa’s space program is a complete lie) with biblical literalism (the Earth is the flat, center of the universe, with heaven above the sky and hell below the ground).

The movement does claim a few celebrities. In 2007 The View co-host and evangelical Christian Sherri Shepherd caused a collective gasp in the early world of social media when she publicly questioned whether the Earth was flat. Former MTV diva Tila Tequila, rapper B.o.B., and Boston Celtics Kyrie Irving have all publicly identified as flat Earthers.

At Thursday’s conference, Davidson was giddy to announce the unexpected appearance of the YouTube personality Logan Paul (whose channel has more than 18 million subscribers). Paul made a brief appearance on stage, where he announced he was “coming out of the flat Earth closet” to a thunderous applause from the crowd.

Their increase in relevance is primarily due to social media and an endlessly curious media. The Washington Post, for example, has run six separate articles about an amateur rocketeer attempting to kiss the sky and video-record that the world is flat.

But for the most part, flat Earthers are one of the most mocked subcultures of our time.

They have inspired the ire of Neil deGrasse Tyson, Modern Family and an evangelical scholar whose work they have cited as evidence for their theory.

“They’ve taken my writing about ancient Israelite cosmology, interpreted it in this uber-literal way, and used it to prop up this flat Earth idea,” said Michael Heiser, a biblical scholar from Liberty University and host of The Naked Bible podcast, who has expressed his frustration with the misinterpretation of his work by flat Earthers.

Like most debates between scholars and fundamentalists, his gripe with flat Earthers comes down to whether the Bible should be seen as an allegorical or literal text.

“In Genesis, you have an Earth that is round but flat, with a solid dome over it,” says Heiser. “In Proverbs, there are references to the seas being held in place where light meets darkness, which is the horizon, where the dome covers and seals the Earth. You have references to the Earth being set upon a foundation, known as the pillars of the Earth. You have waters beneath the Earth, which is the realm of the dead.

“All of this is standard vocabulary for how people of this time and place viewed the world. They didn’t know about Antarctica or New Zealand. The Bible is an ancient Mediterranean-centered document, written by people who are describing their world through their experiences. The mountains are described as holding the dome of the sky in place, but there was no REI store nearby where they could buy mountain climbing gear and scale these peaks to see what was going on.”

Heiser is a Christian himself, albeit one who prefers to view the Bible in its historical context.

Many people at the conference, including Davidson, say they have been kicked out of churches, or lost jobs with churches, or suffered broken relationships with family members because they have gone public with their beliefs about a flat Earth.

They see the Denver conference as a rare opportunity to share a physical space with fellow believers.

“It’s very cathartic being around other [flat Earthers],” said Davidson. “It’s so important, because we’ve been isolated and abused, and now we can breathe, relate and connect with like-minded people … I’d say only 20% of flat Earthers are actually out of the closet about this. What you see now is just the first wave. There’s a bigger wave coming and it’s gonna catch the world off guard.”",mainstream,M133c8,flat.earth
989,"As a child, Brian Jessup was one of the top figure skaters in his home province of Ontario, but these days the ice brings up painful memories.

""I've always felt that it doesn't do me any good to recollect and think back because it brings up the feelings,"" he told CBC reporter Jamie Strashin.

Over six years in the mid-1980s, Jessup was sexually assaulted by his former figure skating coach Kevin Hicks. Hicks was convicted in 2015.

An investigation by CBC News and Sports reveals at least 222 coaches who were involved in amateur sports in Canada have been convicted of sexual offences in the past 20 years involving more than 600 victims under the age of 18.

""No sport is immune. We found cases across 36 different sports,"" said Strashin, who worked on the investigation.

""The swath of damage that is caused by these cases is tremendous because in every one of these cases you have someone who the community trusted,"" he told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.

503,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - If Scott Troetel is out with friends when the Indianapolis Colts are playing, he often reaches for his Blackberry to check how running back Joseph Addai is doing.

But Troetel, who is 32 and lives in Boulder, Colorado, is not particularly interested in the Colts. Addai’s performance is crucial to “Addai in the Life,” Troetel’s fantasy football team.

Fantasy sports, where fans select real athletes for make-believe teams, are exploding onto new platforms like smart phones and social networking sites, grabbing the attention of advertisers, wireless carriers and software companies.

And with a growing number of people playing casual games on the Internet and a largely untapped market outside the United States, analysts say the market for fantasy sports can only grow.

Among companies benefiting from this growth is 4Info, which alerts its users to things like sports scores and celebrity gossip via text message, with its revenue coming from advertisers.

Of the half a billion text messages that 4Info expects to send this year, as many as 15 percent will be to people seeking sports results to feed into their fantasy sports teams, said CEO Zaw Thet.

“People have yet to realize the full potential of fantasy as it really comes to the cell phone and we’ll see that over the course of the next several years,” said Thet, whose company is backed by Gannett Co, General Electric Co’s NBC Universal and venture capital firms.

While there is disagreement on the origin of fantasy sports, they came to wide attention with the publication of “Rotisserie League Baseball” in 1984, based on a league played by a group of New York media types and rules by magazine writer Daniel Okrent.

The appeal of fantasy leagues to sports fanatics is often cited as a factor in the early success of USA Today, which was launched in 1982 with more detailed baseball statistics than other newspapers.

“It’s like you’ve combined the old macho notion of knowing more than anybody about sports with Dungeons and Dragons,” said Robert Thompson, professor of pop culture at Syracuse University. “It turns out that’s a pretty good marriage.”

Troetel, for example, checks on his players at least two or three times a week, using his handheld device to go to the relevant websites. “The way I know sports now is far and away greater than if I didn’t play fantasy sports,” he said.

Fantasy sports took an exponential leap in the late 1990s as the Internet made sports results more widely available and sites like Yahoo Inc began to host fantasy sports leagues for a fee.

There are now more than 27 million players in the United States and annual revenue is in the range of $800 million to $1 billion, according to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association.

Fans already use their mobile phones to read sports news, review game scores and check on their teams. Wireless carriers are now working to align themselves exclusively with whatever sports properties they can as a way to make themselves more attractive to consumers.

“If you’re the only one who offers what people want, they’re going to find a way to switch to your service,” said Steve Gaffney, director of sports and entertainment marketing for Sprint Nextel Corp, which has deals with the National Football League and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR).

While small screens are not that attractive to advertisers, smart phones like Research in Motion’s Blackberry and Apple’s iPhone that offer live streaming video and other multimedia features is undeniable, said Bob Bowman, chief executive of Major League Baseball’s advanced media unit.

Another growth area is social networking sites like Facebook, which is hosting a fantasy football game with 350,000 users since it started in July, making it one of the larger fantasy football games on the Internet.

“Fantasy sports at its core is a set of microcommunities of your good friends that you want to stay in touch with and ‘talk smack’ to, and Facebook allows people to do that,” said Jeff Ma, co-founder of Citizen Sports Network, which runs the Facebook game in partnership with Time Warner’s Sports Illustrated.

Ma, whose San Francisco-based firm is backed by venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, is the basis for the main character in the book “Bringing Down the House” and the movie “21,” in which a group of students used math to win millions of dollars from casinos.

Another big growth area for fantasy sports is among so-called casual gamers, those whose interest is limited or who may not have a lot of free time to play.

ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co, in late August introduced a game where users try to select winners and top performers in an effort to be first to build a 25-pick winning streak over four months that would net a $1 million prize.

“It’s our strategy to develop games that are very easy to play,” said Raphael Poplock, vice president of games for ESPN Digital Media.

These casual players could help almost double the number of fantasy sports players to 50 million over the next five years, said Chris Russo, CEO of Fantasy Sports Ventures, a media company focused on fantasy sports.

Other companies taking advantage of the growth in fantasy sports include Google’s YouTube, Electronic Arts and advertisers like Gillette and Coke.

“The sheer participation numbers are so overwhelming,” said Andrew Bangs, a community marketing specialist with YouTube, which launched a fantasy football channel in July.

The growth in fantasy sports is also feeding back into the real sports leagues, where fantasy sports fans spend more time engaged with real teams than fans who don’t play fantasy sports.

“Nearly 60 percent of revenue comes from fans attending games, so to the extent I can get a casual fan to go to one game that means a lot,” baseball’s Bowman said. “If I can repeat that 10 million times, that’s real money.”

Overseas markets offer another enticing opportunity, as games around cricket, soccer, rugby and other sports are not as developed as those in the United States, said Steve Byrd, executive vice president with Stats Inc, which licenses sports content and statistics for almost 90 different sports leagues.

“You get the growing middle class in China and India, with Internet access, they’re going to want to engage with their sports the way that we do,” he said.

In addition, industry executives said the number of fantasy websites is exploding. That expansion will only speed up since the U.S. Supreme Court in June declined to hear the appeal by Major League Baseball of a lower-court ruling that any company has the free-speech right to use the names and performance statistics of famous athletes.

Of course with so many companies out there, there is bound to be a shakeout.

“One out of every 10 sites makes it,” said Rick Wolf, chairman of the Fantasy Sports Association. “For the small companies, it’s very hard to succeed.”

Not everyone is in favor of fantasy sports.

“I am the flat-earth society on this one,” said Dave Zirin, sports writer for The Nation, a left-wing magazine. “It’s a very atomizing experience to live in the United States at times and so sports is one of those few ways where we’re able to get a sense of collective joy. Fantasy sports runs counter to that.”

529,"Some of the best surfing spots in the world are located along the U.S. West Coast and in Hawaii, and the reason is simple: the waves! But why are waves on the West Coast bigger than those on the East Coast? There are three primary factors that determine a wave's height:

According to the Encyclopedia of the Sea, a wave is ""the oscillations of the sea caused by the wind blowing along the surface and moving in the direction in which the wind blows."" The important thing to remember about waves is that the water isn't moving -- the energy from the wind is moving through the water. On the West Coast, the prevailing winds are behind the waves, which increases the waves' energy. On the East Coast, the prevailing winds blow against the incoming waves, decreasing the waves' energy.

­ ­On each coast of the United States is a continental shelf. To understand the continental shelf, let's imagine that the ocean dried up. The land under the water looks a bit like the Grand Canyon, with cliffs and valleys, plateaus and ridges. On the West Coast, if you walked out onto the continental shelf, you would notice that the shelf (the area between the beach and where the drop-off begins) is narrower. This means that if you have less sand to walk on before the ocean's floor drops off steeply, like a cliff. On the East Coast, the shelf is broader -- there is more sand to walk on as the shelf drops gradually, like a really long ramp.

Underneath the surface of the water, particles are spinning in the direction that the wind is moving in. The particles are largest at the surface of the water. The deeper you go in the water, the smaller the spinning particles. As the wave moves inland and hits the upward slope of the continental shelf on the East Coast, the friction causes the particles to slow down, so the wave gradually collapses on itself. On the West Coast, the shelf rises suddenly near the coast, so the waves are much larger when they crash into the coastline -- the particles (and thus the wave) haven't been slowed down by extended friction with the shelf.

The Pacific Ocean on the West Coast has a greater expanse than the Atlantic Ocean on the East Coast. This means that the fetch (the distance over which the wind blows) is greater on the West Coast than on the East Coast. In this case, you can think of wave as a snowball: The farther you roll your snowball along in the snow, the bigger it gets. West-coast waves tend to start way out in the Pacific Ocean, so they have a greater distance to travel before they hit the shore -- more time to grow in size and length.

Dr. Ernie Knowles, associate professor of oceanography at NC State University, can help us put all of this together: ""The steep shelf on the West Coast would cause a more abrupt buildup of the shoaling wave (so waves would be 'steeper' when they break). But the much longer fetch in the Pacific Ocean allows the waves to receive more wind energy, and so they grow larger. The swell arriving on the West Coast has periods in the range of 10 to 17 seconds (quite long waves), while the East Coast swell is more in the six- to 10-second range.""

415,"ANDREW FLINTOFF has revealed he believes Earth is NOT round and is instead ""turnip shaped"" in a bizarre conspiracy theory.

The England cricket legend, 42, once revealed he was hooked on a podcast called The Flat Earthers.

In 2017, Flintoff revealed he believes the Earth is not perfectly spherical - but has now taken it a step further by calling it turnip-shaped.

When asked about his Flat Earth comments, ""Freddie"" - speaking to Laura Woods on talkSPORT - revealed: ""It's more like a flat turnip...

""I'm not saying it's like a pancake, I've never said that.

""I'm saying it's slightly round, but not your perfect sphere.

""People think I'm daft, but if you think about it, there's this thing called gravity that we're sticking to the world in...

""If you think about that in the cold light of day, it's bonkers isn't it? It is bonkers.

""Imagine being in Australia, you're upside down... all the blood would rush to your head. It would be a nightmare.""

The 2005 Ashes hero admitted to his new obsession, the The Flat Earthers podcast.

The show involves conspiracy theorists who are adamant the world is flat - and who even accuse Disney of peddling lies about the planet’s shape.

At the time, Flintoff insisted there was “evidence to suggest the world isn’t round”.

He added: “If you’re in a helicopter and you hover why does the Earth not come to you if it’s round?

“Why, if we’re hurtling through space, why would water stay still? Why is it not wobbling?

""Also if you fire a laser about 16 miles, if the world was curved, you shouldn’t be able to see it but you can.”

But once again he admitted he does not believe Earth is totally flat, instead claiming it was “bulbous, like a turnip”.

He said: “The middle is the North Pole, around the outside is the South Pole which is like a big wall of ice.

""This is why all governments now have bases on the South Pole.”

Other sporting stars who believe the world is not round include NBA star Kyrie Irving and wrestler AJ Styles.

Flintoff recently revealed he and wife Rachael welcomed their fourth child to the world over Christmas.

398,"I finished watching this video, Nava lenticulara (The Lenticular Spacecraft) (video can be found at the end of this article), and though it’s visually compelling, the music is great, and the narrator has a “soothing, hypnotic voice”, I have questions and comments:

Supposedly this is an etheric (ascended) Sirian A civilization. They are highly advanced in technology, and call the main ship, the Mother Ship – “Mama”. We call earth “Mother”.

The Mother ship allowed itself to be attacked by the “reptilians”, in order to trigger a “coming together in unity” of the various other galactics: Arcturians were first, then others.

They were trained to help with the rebuilding, as a pretext to creating a common goal: uniting against the “evil enemy”, and assisting earth’s peoples.

The story is a metaphor for Christ, having “laid down his life” for our sins. Sacrifice. The Mother Ship allowed herself to be attacked by the reptilians, with a larger plan of bringing together other galactics into unity.

The Sirians decide they cannot contact us directly, as it would be “too disturbing”. So, the Mother ship is building, in her “storage hold”, at the bottom, a new “baby ship”, while a team effort is made to repair her body, atom by atom.

It will be the focus of all the different galactic groups, who are/will be attempting to communicate with us via holographic technologies. She is calling forth an etheric partner, to mate with, and the little ship in her womb is going to literally “be birthed”.

Where have we heard this story before?! Over and over and over…new clothes, same old broken record. Sirius B is allegedly the Dogon tribe and is called Satais: Satan? Saturn? And Sirius C has “penis envy problems”, since it’s so “tiny”, and insignificant. Name? ANU.

You can figure out the rest. See the Lessin’s work on the ANUnnaki. Giving them some credit, no race is good or bad.

Like us, there are wise ones and savage selfish ones, a “mixed bag”. The problem with “Ascended Masters” in any guise, is complacency and a desire to rule over, not create with. In a fully ascended society or group, there would be no thought forms of killing, envy, using others, rape, wars, etc.

Those are all from the 9D underworld, the Matrix, from which we are individually being guided to “the door” out. We have become “Creators” at the material-matter level, which is something the “advanced ones” lack. They do not have the comprehension, or the necessary empathy and love for all things in creation, even a bug.

They are so mired in technology that it’s like another trap, similar to here, the “earthly maze”. This is a place of unending illusions – nothing creating nothing real, it’s all false.

Only our truest emotions and higher states of consciousness are like pearls, that get placed on a strand with a knot between each one, “in case” the strand (DNA) breaks. Ours has been heavily tampered with, yet here we are!

Eventually, Sirius A view their technology as a great gift to us. Hidden devices, behind our speakers, will “create feelings at the emotional level”, thoroughly “blissing us out”, we will be in a kind of virtual dream world that’s forever peaceful.

Question: where are all the living things…trees, wind, water, fire, earth, oceans, etc.? They are not there. What happened to Gaia-Sophia? Not there. It appears to be yet another carrot, being dangled, to subdue “the monstrous humans”, that cannot even be dealt with in person, we are so savage.

There is no mention of Pleiadian or other involvement, so this is a serious Sirius A problem! There is always a “bad guy”…those evil… “x, y’s and z’x”, be they this, that or another. Lucifer and Satan are very popular, reptilians are out, Archons in, A.I. is here now, and the demigods…those pesky interlopers.

I vaguely remember Sirius A and B both ascended, and C didn’t make it, and is “Planet X”, feeding off of earth’s energy, mostly on our human divinity being kept repressed. Religions collapse when we step up to the plate! Politics, corporations, countries, all collapse, like a wave collapsing into Zero Point, so they all have a lot invested in keeping us ignorant and savage.

The plan showed in this video is a clear message about “overwriting” one of the Creators, perhaps the head honcho, that created our multi-verse. Perhaps, “it” is US.

As long as we’re fragmented, and not in one piece, or unified, which is the idea here, our “powers” remain hidden within, until we go within to find our own truths, while knowing that the projection “out there” is Maya, illusion. It can only create more of itself, more illusions…

It’s quite possible that “ascension” is not like a ladder going up, a la Jacob, but is an inner descent through the 9D Underworlds, where we are now at 3D, going into 2D (Telluric/ crystalline), 1D (Core/ Heart), to be birthed in ZERO POINT or “no time”, Graduation!

That is the process of i n c e n s i o n, which has nothing to do with the fake hologram we’re obsessed with. That is the “earthly maze”.

It’s collapsing as we speak… “flat earth people”, the “sun is a “microchip” that’s going to stop working, thrusting our universe into a short period of blissful darkness, not light. Those who panic, unable to get “centered”, will find that location quite difficult to navigate.

It requires the ability to endure silence, and who today can stand more than half an hour of complete silence? We’re constantly busy busy busy, with one flashing glint of “fool’s gold” after another!

Meher Baba drew a circle within a circle, representing the “Original Real Everything” and a smaller dotted circle, “Original Real Nothing”.

Dotted lines come out of the shadow, (nothing), to create the “False Everything”, with its “innumerable nothings”. This is a false creation, which will continue to create more of itself, until we wake up, snap out of it, and “grok” that we are part of the Original Real Everything.

The “shadow” dissolves, or becomes smaller, as we each awaken to our own inner truths, and know that we are “Gods in our own universe”. Our power is being milked and diverted, by the “False Everything”.

It will do anything to remain unseen, Unconscious and pulling the strings, like a Puppet Master. Like the film, The Truman Show, his is a metaphor for our own sticky wicket here.

That’s a lower – bottom of the fish bowl frequency, of scum. It cannot make it through any shifts, created authentically. We’d be in another cycle of incarnation, only they would do away with the “death”, to some human’s glee, until that “perfect world” became TOO perfect.

Boredom sets in, then you have “disaster groupies”, who travel into the past, to watch earth’s and other planet’s, huge disasters. The film, Disaster in Time [aka Timescape (1992)] foreshadows this beautifully, and it’s one of my favorite films.

I think we need to educate these “higher beings”, and let them know they may have the best of intentions, most likely not, and that we are capable of communing and creation from our own thoughts, being creators with amnesia.

I prefer not to remain in a coma, but would rather WAKE UP, be responsible for my creations, and enjoy the harmony of friends who resonate, have chosen a path of peace, love, joy and fun! Where is the humor? The “humans” seem to be floating around in a daze, just dreaming. Sorry, it’s got some fatal flaws!

I have no intention of permitting nanotechnology, artificial “mood enhancers all around me, beaming “feel good bliss” as you approach them, to be MY world!

Still, there are some great visuals and it offers a PERSPECTIVE, a point of view, but it’s very controlled and highly suggestive and is loaded with “propaganda”. But, we’re accustomed to having others think for us, so it’s a familiar place for most to be.

Someone is going to save us…the running “Savior Program”, A.I. The Architects try to remove LOVE from the equation, and they continue to have to destroy their creations. They can’t survive without true love, felt by a “heart space”, the Higher Emotional Center.

When it is active, along with Higher Intellectual Center, it activates the third part of the equation, the trinity within: non-dual, transcendent, infinite and eternal.",conspiracy,C00bdb,flat.earth
1263,"Neil deGrasse Tyson, famed astrophysicist and television host, has confirmed the long held belief Earth is indeed round and not flat. Appearing online in a YouTube video posted on the StarTalk channel, Mr Tyson vented his outrage and debunked the Flat Earth myth. Unamused by his co-host Chuck Nice’s question about the shape of the Earth, the vexed scientist said: “We have video from space of the rotating, spherical Earth. The Earth is round.” The Flat Earth Theory is an old and obviously debunked belief the world is not spherical, but rather a flat disk surround by a towering barrier of ice.

Believers of the bunkum theory, commonly referred to as Flat Earthers, claim to rely on their own senses and observations rather than empirical scientific data. Many Flat Earthers have accused leading scientific bodies like NASA of deceiving the public about Earth’s shape. But Mr Tyson now expressed his confusion when faced with the number of people who still subscribe to the theory. The physicist said: “What is odd, is there are people who think Earth is flat but recognise that the Moon is round, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and the sun are all spheres.

He then went on to explain why the vast majority of stellar objects in the observable universe are all round, and only occasionally appear to be flattened. According to Mr Tyson all the known laws of physics and processes in space “favour the sphere”. He said: “And if something is not a sphere and is a little flattened, you can ask what flattened it, and you find out it’s rotating real fast.

“So then it gets a little flattened because of that. So almost everything in the universe is either a sphere or light distortion of a sphere, for some other things happening to it.

“We can just see how the universe favours spheres.” But then why do so many people still believe the world is flat? A lot of it comes down to the fundamental problems with free speech, Mr Tyson argued. Mr Tyson blamed the scores of people who truly believe the Earth is flat and spout their false theories to others without consequence.

The physicist also criticised the American schooling system, saying it does not teach people to think critically. He said: “Our system needs to train you not only what to know, but how to think about information and knowledge and evidence. “If you don’t have that kind of training you would run around and believe anything.” The Flat Earth Society claims to encourage the spread of ideas and free thought since at least 1865.",mainstream,M12a3c,flat.earth
788,"Google censorship is accelerating all the time, as the digital behemoth more and more shows its true colors. On Jan. 25th 2019, Google owned-YouTube announced on its official blog that it’s going to stop recommending “borderline content” to its users and viewers – presumably because it deeply cares. Hmm-hmm.

YouTube states that such content “could misinform users in harmful ways.” Many people have awoken to the truth of the NWO (New World Order) and many aspects of the overarching conspiracy by watching YouTube videos over the years, including by letting YouTube guide them to new videos through its recommendation algorithm.

Now the free flow of information is about to stymied once again, and as with all things related to the NWO Agenda, this will be another step of many to come, since Google serves the Agenda.

YouTube has yet to fully detail what it means by borderline content, although interestingly enough, it has divulged 3 examples of what it has in mind:

“We’ll continue that work this year, including taking a closer look at how we can reduce the spread of content that comes close to — but doesn’t quite cross the line of — violating our Community Guidelines.

“To that end, we’ll begin reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways — such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11.”

Whatever Google is going after is a barometer of what the NWO manipulators most don’t want you to know. Natural cures are a big threat to the profits and monopoly of Big Pharma.

They are also threat to those at the peak of the control pyramid, because a fit, healthy and strong populace is far harder to control than a dependent, sick and weak one.

Of course, there are many charlatans in the natural health world (just as in the Western medical world) who will exaggerate, lie and claim anything just to make a sale, so Google is using this as way to garner more support for its censorship efforts.

This will have the unfortunate effect of burying videos that truly teach natural cures to disease. There are so many examples of budding, promising or proven natural cures to diseases that Big Pharma has tried to suppress.

Just look at cancer alone – natural treatments such as vitamin B17 (laetrile/amygdalin), Rife frequency machines, baking soda, the Gerson Therapy, the Budwig Diet, graviola and many more are all not sanctioned by health authorities despite the evidence supporting them.

Far from protecting its users, YouTube is about to do more harm to by curbing the free flow of information to prevent more people from seeing alternative cures and possibly trying them out, or at least having the opportunity and freedom to make up their own minds.

Is YouTube going to stop people knowing about the power of medicinal cannabis? Or C60? Organic fruit and vegetables? Is it going to try to shut down discourse on the true meaning of healing vs. managing disease?

People in the alternative research community are still divided on the issue of Flat Earth (FE), although the large majority believe it is either a psy-op or a delusion. Regardless of what turns out to be true, however, the fact cannot be denied that many Flat Earth videos are raising important questions that standard mainstream physics doesn’t appear to have answers for.

If it turns out that all the questions and doubt can be adequately answered and countered by the existing heliocentric model, then good; the FE movement will have done heliocentrism a favor by challenging it and making it stronger.

This is precisely why no advanced society need fear freedom of speech, asking questions, investigating topics or being curious. There is no such thing as a dumb question. All questions help clarify our understanding. Harm only comes by suppressing questions, not by answering them.

Given Google’s penchant for promoting the NWO agenda (e.g. Project Dragonfly, Project Maven, the Selfish Ledger and the Good Censor), I consider it highly significant that YouTube is going after the Flat Earth Movement. Curious researchers would do well to ask themselves: what is Google worried that you will find out by investigating the nature of the planet on which you live?

Could it be this? Physicist Explains Why We Live In A Virtual Reality

The “majority” is never a good test of the truthhood of something, however even in this case, Google doesn’t have the majority on its side. An April 2016 Rasmussen poll found that “Americans doubt they’ve been told all the facts about the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States and strongly believe the government should come clean.”

With all the lies, deceit and holes in the official 9/11 narrative, including the large role of Israel in the attacks, shielding people from knowing the truth is far more harmful than saving people from questioning the government and thinking for themselves.

9/11 truth is a good barometer to measure how much someone has woken up to the truth of how our world is run. The good news is that people are waking up in greater numbers than ever before. Thus, YouTube won’t have the public support it might think it will be trying to bury these topics.

Who’s Done More Harm – Free Thinkers or the MSM?

Google-Owned YouTube claims it is embarking on this new phase of censorship (or better put thought control and perception control) to minimize the “harm” to its viewers, yet this is grossly hypocritical.

YouTube has been caught time and again censoring alternative and independent media while allowing child abuse, soft porn and other sorts of content on its platform.

Additionally, YouTube protects the MSM dinosaur media (and its dwindling profits) when the MSM has consistently lied through its teeth to an unsuspecting public.

The MSM has done tremendous “harm” by pushing lies to start wars (e.g. the first Gulf War in 1991 or the Iraq War in 2003), by parroting the official line in false flag ops and by promoting governmental propaganda such as the 2008 Stimulus/Bailout which robbed the American taxpayer to pay Wall St.

That is all on a more superficial level. On a deeper level, YT is pushing forward the censorship agenda of the NWO. It’s not ultimately about money or insider industries helping other insider industries. It’s about perception control.

The self-appointed censors have come up with all sorts of excuses for this censorship, such as hate speech, fake news and borderline content. If we continue to allow this trend, the control freaks at the top of the power pyramid will undoubtedly conjure up any more phrases in the future to achieve their goal of total information control.

I can think of some possibilities they might try: “harmful content”, “false information”, “disallowed speech”, “forbidden writing”, “unsanctioned words,” and on and on it will go.

For instance, USA Today says YT will employ 10,000 people to hunt for “offensive” videos. If this is coming directly from Google, then the game has already changed from “harmful content” to “offensive videos.” Where will it end?

There will be a thousand reasons proffered to squelch free speech, however no matter how many are proposed, and no matter how good the intentions, they always overlook the point that the self-appointed rulers and censors cannot ever know enough to judge what it is true or false.

This is of course not to mention the thousand ways rulers become corrupted and find it in their own interest to suppress, obfuscate and cover up.

Conclusion: People Must Think for Themselves if a Society is to Be Free

In a free society, people must educate themselves to learn the difference between the hucksters and the genuine ones, so that it doesn’t matter who speaks, because each person can make up their own mind.

It doesn’t matter what civilization, what culture or what era you are in, the principle will remain the same. The only way we can progress as a society is to have open discourse, debate and discussion.

We have to trust that people are wise enough and mature enough to digest information and make up their own minds as to the veracity and usefulness of it.

If people are not, then as a society we need to focus our efforts on education to raise people to that level. In such a society, the people would ultimately see anything false, inflammatory, manipulative, limiting and/or useless for what it is.

If you’re looking for solutions to combat censorship, consider using platforms such as Minds.com and D.Tube who have decentralization, non-censorship and freedom of speech written into their code.",conspiracy,C040b9,big.pharma; flat.earth; september.11.attack
994,"The United States is the world’s second biggest producer of carbon dioxide (CO2) after China, figures show, as the world reacts to Donald Trump’s decision to abandon the Paris Climate Agreement.

The US President announced this week the country would withdraw from the accord, ending what he said were “draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country”.

China is world’s biggest producer of CO2 and has vowed to work with Europe to ensure the Paris Accord’s terms are met.

According to data gathered by the NGO Germanwatch for its 2017 Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), the US contributes 16% of the world’s CO2 from energy-related emissions.

China and the US combined make up 44% of the world’s emissions.

The US is now alongside Syria and Nicaragua as the only three countries not signed up to the agreement, while almost 200 others are committed to it.

Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International Executive Director, said: “Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement will turn America from a global climate leader into a flat earth society of one.

636,"An incredible sighting that occurred last week in Nevada County has had ufologists all worked up and for good reason; if this photo is genuine, it might explain why our planet is regularly visited by alien spacecraft.

Although water in outer space is not as scarce as was once thought, it’s not as readily available as it is on Earth. Perhaps the presence of liquid water is what draws aliens to our planet.

Last Friday, a pilot and amateur photographer from California snapped this unbelievable photo showing an unidentified object hovering over Scotts Flat Lake in Nevada County, CA.

The pilot, who chose to remain anonymous, said that the UFO appeared to be sucking water out of the lake.

Intrigued by the occurrence, the pilot tried to establish radio communication with the mysterious craft but was met with silence.

“As you can see from the picture, I was on my final approach to the Nevada County Airport when I spotted this red object. Then I noticed this ‘water beam’ underneath it. It kinda looked like a long, clear straw. So I radioed it to let them know I was around and they did not return my request, which is highly unusual,” the pilot told a local newspaper.

Does the fact that this sighting was reported by a pilot increase its credibility? Perhaps. But it certainly offers no clues regarding the UFO’s mission and intentions.

277,"Around 130 million years ago, dinosaurs made their way through the wet sands of a river delta in what is now the remote Kimberley region of western Australia. When the tide goes out along the beaches of the Dampier Peninsula today, it reveals thousands of their massive fossil footprints preserved in sandstone rock.

Now, the region has revealed an extraordinarily diverse array of dinosaur tracks along a single 25-km (15.5-mile) stretch of the Daimler Peninsula. Thousands of fossil footprints left between 127 and 140 million years ago, including tracks from 21 different types of dinosaurs, line the beaches near Walmadany (James Price Point).

Some of the armored dino tracks belong to stegosaurus, and are the only confirmed evidence of that particular dinosaur in Australia. Not only that—among the tracks left by the enormous four-legged plant eaters known as sauropods (a group that includes brachiosaurus and brontosaurus, among others) was one print measuring nearly 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 meters) long. It’s believed to be the largest dino track ever recorded, topping the previous record of 1.15 meters (or nearly 3 feet 9 inches). Scientists discovered that giant footprint, the largest known carnivorous dinosaur track, in Bolivia last July.

“There were five different types of predatory dinosaur tracks, at least six types of tracks from long-necked herbivorous sauropods, four types of tracks from two-legged herbivorous ornithopods, and six types of tracks from armored dinosaurs,” the lead archaeologist on the project, Steve Salisbury of the University of Queensland, said in a statement. “It’s such a magical place—Australia’s own Jurassic Park, in a spectacular wilderness setting. ”

Though Australia has many rocks old enough to contain dinosaur fossils, relatively few have been found on the continent. This is due to its predominantly low, flat terrain, which makes exposed fossils vulnerable to erosion by the elements. Up until now, most of Australia’s dino fossils have been found on the eastern side of the continent, and are considerably younger (between 115 and 90 million years old).

Local indigenous people in the Kimberley region have claimed the trackway as part of their oral history tradition, likely for thousands of years. As Salisbury explained to BBC News, the aborigines see the fossilized footprints as part of a creation myth based on a figure called Marala, the emu-man. “Wherever [Marala] went, “ Salisbury said, “he left behind three-toed tracks that now we recognize as the tracks of meat-eating dinosaurs.”

In fact, it was members of a local aboriginal community, the Goolarabooloo, who first told the scientists it was there. In 2008, after the Australian government announced plans to build a liquid natural gas facility in the area, Goolarabooloo leaders asked Salisbury to document the beach tracks, hoping evidence of dinosaur fossils in the region would lead the government to stop the project.

Between 2011 and 2016, the team of paleontologists from Queensland University and James Cook University spent some 400 hours recording details of the tracks. Using a technique called 3-D photogrammetry, they took pictures of the prints from different angles and used the images to build accurate models to measure and examine. They also took silicone peels of many of the tracks, which can be used to make casts to display in museums.

The researchers recently published their findings in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Meanwhile, development of the gas plant in the region was halted after project leaders concluded it was not economically feasible.",mainstream,M13828,flat.earth
1236,"Anyone who's ever taken a physics course has learned the same myth for centuries now: that any object thrown, shot, or fired in the gravitational field of Earth will trace out a parabola before striking the ground. If you neglect external forces like wind, air resistance, or any other terrestrial objects, this parabolic shape describes how the center-of-mass of your object moves extremely accurately, no matter what it is or what else is at play.

But under the laws of gravity, a parabola is an impossible shape for an object that's gravitationally bound to the Earth. The math simply doesn't work out. If we could design a precise enough experiment, we'd measure that projectiles on Earth make tiny deviations from the predicted parabolic path we all derived in class: microscopic on the scale of a human, but still significant. Instead, objects thrown on Earth trace out an elliptical orbit similar to the Moon. Here's the unexpected reason why.

If you wanted to model the gravitational field at Earth's surface, there are two simplifying assumptions you could make:
• the Earth, at least in your vicinity, is flat rather than curved,
• and that Earth's gravitational field points straight down relative to your current location.

Any time you throw and release an object, therefore, it enters a situation known as free-fall. In the directions that are parallel to the Earth's surface (horizontal), the speed of any projectile will remain constant. In the directions that are perpendicular to Earth's surface (vertical), however, your projectile will accelerate downwards at 9.8 m/s²: the acceleration due to gravity at Earth's surface. If you make these assumptions, then the trajectory you calculate will always be a parabola, exactly what we're taught in physics classes around the globe.

But neither one of these assumptions are true. The Earth may appear flat — so indistinguishable from flat that we cannot detect it over the distances most projectiles cover — but the reality is that it has a spheroidal shape. Even over distances of just a few meters, the difference between a perfectly flat Earth and a curved Earth comes into play at the 1-part-in-1,000,000 level.

This approximation doesn't matter so much for the trajectory of an individual projectile, but the second approximation does. From any location along its path, a projectile isn't truly accelerated ""straight down"" in the vertical direction, but towards the center of the Earth. Over the same distance of a few meters, the difference in angle between ""straight down"" and ""towards the center of the Earth"" also comes into play at the 1-part-in-1,000,000 level, but this one makes a difference.

For a typical system, like a kicked soccer ball, a thrown football, or even a home run in baseball, the deviations from a parabola will show up at the level of tens to perhaps a hundred microns: smaller than a single paramecium. But the true trajectory is fascinating, and something derived by Johannes Kepler more than half a century before Newton came along.

Just like the Moon, any projectile traces out an elliptical orbit, with the center of the Earth as one focus of that ellipse. The only difficulty for a projectile on Earth, as opposed to the Moon, is that the Earth itself gets in the way. As a result, we only see one tiny portion of the ellipse: the part that rises slightly above the Earth's surface, reaches the peak of its trajectory (known as aphelion in celestial mechanics), and then falls back towards the Earth's center.

As soon as the surface of the Earth gets in the way, however, the problem resets once again. If the projectile bounces at all, it will create an entirely new fragment-of-an-ellipse for its trajectory to follow, which can again be approximated very well by a parabola.

This happens for a simple reason that we typically take for granted: the Earth is made out of the same type of stuff, normal matter, that a typical projectile is made out of. Normal matter, which typically consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons, don't just experience the gravitational force, but nuclear and electromagnetic forces as well. It's the electromagnetic force that causes the typical interactions we experience between particles, enabling elastic and inelastic collisions, and preventing our projectiles from simply slipping through the Earth.

We can get around this problem, however, by imagining that we had something that didn't interact with normal matter as our projectile. Perhaps it could be a low-energy neutrino; perhaps it could be a clump of dark matter. In either case, this projectile, once we released it, would only experience the gravitational force, and would pass through the surface and interior of the Earth itself under only the force of gravity.

If you expected that this particle would make a closed ellipse, however, and would return to its original location some ~90 minutes later back above the surface of the Earth from where it was first thrown, you've gone and made another approximation that isn't quite right. When we calculate orbital trajectories, we treat the Earth as a single point: where all of its mass is located directly at its center. When we calculate trajectories of satellites, space stations, and even the Moon, this works just fine. But for a particle that passes through Earth's surface, that approximation is no good any longer.

As long as you're outside of a mass that's shaped like a sphere (or spheroid), all of that mass gravitationally attracts you towards the center of the object. But if you're only outside part of that mass (and only part of it is closer to the center of the world than you are), then all the parts of that mass that are outside of your present location cancel out.

You can only feel the gravitational effect of the mass that lies interior to you, assuming that everything external to your position is spherically symmetric. In electromagnetism, this is a consequence of Gauss's Law; in gravitational physics, it's a consequence of (the related) Birkhoff's theorem. But what this practically means is that once you start falling through the Earth, you experience less and less of the internal mass's gravitational pull.

Rather than an ellipse, therefore, your trajectory would slowly change into a more oval, egg-like shape. As you passed through the less-dense crust and mantle and headed towards the inner and outer cores, you'd notice that there were not only smooth changes, but a few discontinuous ""kinks"" in the shape you traced out, corresponding to the various layers (of varying densities) in the Earth's interior.

You would never re-emerge out of the other side of the Earth, but would fall through past the center by some amount, turning around in the core or the mantle depending on some subtle effects that aren't so easy to calculate. Not only are the varying densities at different depths not completely known, but the rotational speeds of the varying layers interior to Earth have some uncertainties in them. If you consider even a single mass passing through the Earth, depending on the exact path it takes, dynamical friction begins to play a role as well.

When a particle passes by other massive particles, it gravitationally attracts them. If a particle speeds past all of the other ones, it will deflect their trajectories towards where it just passed through, which has the net effect of slowing the motion of the original particle. Depending on which way the original projectile was oriented with respect to Earth's rotation and internal motions, this can affect the trajectory of whatever particle passes through the Earth.

Over the timespan of a single orbit, which still takes approximately 85-90 minutes or so, this can have a large enough effect so that the projectile doesn't return to its original starting point. If we combine the effects of:
• the gravitation of an elliptical orbit due to a point mass,
• the varying density, composition, and (possibly) rotation rates of the Earth's layers,
• and fold in the effects of dynamical friction,

a projectile won't make a closed ellipse, but will instead return to a point offset by its starting point by up to as much as ~10 meters.

For most practical applications, it doesn't hurt anyone to treat projectiles as having a parabolic trajectory. But if you care about micron-or-better precision, or are dealing with a large structure (like a suspension bridge) that spans 100 meters or more, you cannot treat the Earth's gravitational field as a constant. Everything is accelerated not ""downwards,"" but towards the center of the Earth, enabling a projectile's true trajectory — an ellipse — to be revealed.

Studying the various effects that are at play, both external to the Earth as well as within our planet's interior, can also teach us when and under what circumstances it's important to make these considerations. For most applications, air resistance is a far larger concern than any effects like the various layers of Earth's interior or dynamical friction, and treating Earth's gravitational field as a constant is totally justified. But for some problem, these differences matter. We are free to make whatever approximations we choose, but when our accuracy suffers beyond a critical threshold, we'll have no one but ourselves to blame.",mainstream,M0f7ef,flat.earth
731,"‘A mush of meaningless gobbledegook’ (Blunt and Jones, 1997, p. 913).

In this brief reply, we will demonstrate how it obfuscates, and augments, the lack of substance in their own research. We also delineate their self‐contradiction, express concern over their claiming ownership and closure of what could be a vibrant field of study, and explain how they have completely missed the point of questioning the very concept of a Maslowian‐style hierarchy. Blunt and Jones' (1997) conclusion, part of which we have quoted above, appears to be an attempt to respond to our explanation for the lack of such a hierarchy, an explanation which we couched in terms of the importance of retaining cultural identity.

542,"A pioneering robotic spacecraft shut down on Saturday after radioing results of its first and probably last batch of scientific experiments from the surface of a comet, scientists said.Batteries aboard the European Space Agency's Philae comet lander drained, shutting down the washing machine-sized probe after an adventurous and largely unscripted 57-hour mission.Carried aboard the orbiting Rosetta mothership, Philae floated to the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Thursday, but failed to deploy anchoring harpoons.Upon contacting the comet's unexpectedly hard surface, it bounced back up into space twice then came to rest at a still-unknown location about 1 km (0.6 mile) from its original target.Photos and other data relayed by Philae show it finally landed against a cliff or crater wall where there was little sunlight to recharge its batteries. Racing against the clock, scientists activated a series of automated experiments, the first to be conducted from the surface of a comet.Before dying, Philae defied the odds and radioed its science results back to Earth for analysis.Its last task was to reposition itself so that as the comet soars towards the sun, Philae's batteries may recharge enough for a follow-on mission. ""Perhaps when we are nearer to the sun we might have enough solar illumination to wake up the lander and re-establish communication,"" spacecraft operations manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement.Scientists are particularly interested in learning about the chemical composition of any organic molecules in samples drilled out from the comet's body.Comets are believed to be pristine remnants from the formation of our solar system some 4.6 billion years ago.

174,"THE close of one century, the dawn of another, may naturally suggest some brief retrospective glance over the path along which our science has advanced, and some general survey of its present position; but other connection with geology the beginnings and endings of centuries have none. The great periods of movement have hitherto begun, as it were, in the early twilight hours, long before the dawn. Thus the first step forward, since which there has been no retreat, was taken by Steno in the year 1669; more than a century elapsed before James Hutton (1785) gave fresh energy and better direction to the faltering steps of the young science; while it was less than a century later (1863) when Lord Kelvin brought to its aid the powers of the higher mathematics and instructed it in the teachings of modern physics. From Steno onward the spirit of geology was catastrophic; from Hutton onward it grew increasingly uniformitarian; from the time of Darwin and Kelvin it has become evolutional. The ambiguity of the word “uniformitarian “has led to a good deal of fruitless logomachy, against which it may be as well at once to guard by indicating the sense in which it is used here. In one way we are all uniformi- tarians, i. e., we accept the doctrine of the uniform action of natural causes,” but, as applied to geology, uniformity means more than this. Defined in the briefest fashion it is the geology of Lyell. Hutton had given us a “Theory of the Earth,” in its main outlines still faithful and true; and this Lyell spent his life in illustrating and advocating; but as so commonly happens, the zeal of the disciple outran the wisdom of the master, and mere opinions were insisted on as necessary dogma. What did it matter if Hutton as a result of his inquiries into terrestrial history had declared that he found no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end It would have been marvelous if he had! Consider that when Hutton's “Theory” was published, William Smith's famous discovery had not been made, and that nothing was then known of the orderly succession of forms of life, which it is one of the triumphs of geology to have revealed; consider, too, the existing state of physics at the time, and that the modern theories of energy had still to be formulated; consider, also, that spectroscopy had not yet lent its aid to astronomy and the consequent ignorance of the nature of nebulae; and then, if you will, cast a stone at Hutton. With Lyell, however, the,case was different. In pressing his uniformitarian creed upon geology, he omitted to take into account the great advances made by its sister sciences, although he had knowledge of them, and thus sinned against the light. In the last edition of the famous “Principles” we read: “It is a favorite dogma of some physicists that not only the earth, but the sun itself, is continually losing a portion of its heat, and that as there is no known source by which it can be restored, we can foresee the time when all life will cease to exist on this planet, and on the other hand we can look back to a period when the heat was so intense as to be incompatible with the existence of any organic beings such as are known to us in the living or fossil world. Opening address by the President of the Section of Geology, British Association. A geologist in search of some renovating power by which the amount of heat may be made to continue unimpaired for millions of years, past and future, in the solid parts of the earth... has been compared by an eminent physicist to one who dreams he can discover a source of perpetual motion and invent a clock with a self-winding apparatus. But why should we despair of detecting proofs of such regenerating and self-sustaining power in the works of a Divine Ar- tilicer Here we catch the true spirit of uniformity; it admittedly regards the universe as a self-winding clock, and barely conceals a conviction that the clock was warranted to keep true Greenwich time. The law of the dissipation of energy is not a dogma, but a doctrine drawn from observation, while the uniformity of Lyell is in no sense an induction; it is a dogma in the narrowest sense of the word, unproved, incapable of proof; hence perhaps its power upon the human mind; hence, also, the transitoriness of that power. Again, it is only by restricting its inquiries to the stratified rocks of our planet that the dogma of uniformity can be maintained with any pretense of argument. Directly we begin to search the heavens, the possibility, nay even the likelihood, of the nebular origin of our system, with all that it involves, is borne in upon us. Lyell therefore consistently refused to extend his gaze beyond the rocks beneath his feet, and was thus led to do a serious injury to our science. He severed it from cosmogony, for which he entertained and expressed the most profound contempt, and from the mutilation thus inflicted geology is only at length making a slow and painful recovery. Why do I dwell on these facts To depreciate Lyell By no means. No one is more conscious than I of the noble service which Lyell rendered to our cause; his reputation is of too robust a kind to suffer from my unskillful handling, and the fame of his solid contributions to science will endure long after these controversies are forgotten. The echoes of the combat are already dying away, and uni- formitarians, in the sense already defined, are now no more. Indeed, were I to attempt to exhibit any distinguished living geologist as a still surviving supporter of the narrow Lyellian creed, he would probably feel, if such a one there be, that I was unfairly singling him out for unmerited obloquy. Our science has become evolutional, and in the transformation has grown more comprehensive; her petty parochial days are done, she is drawing her provinces closer around her, and is fusing them together into a united and single commonwealth–the science of the earth. Not merely the earths crust, but the whole of earth- knowledge is the subject of our research. To know all that can be known about our planet, this, and nothing less than this, is its aim and scope. From the morphological side geology inquires, not only into the existing form and structure of tne earth, but also into the series of successive morphological states through which it has passed in a long and changeful development. Our science inquires also into the distribution of the earth in time and space; on the physiological side it studies the movements and activities of our planet; and not content with all this, it extends its researches into aetiology and endeavors to arrive at a science of causation. In these pursuits, geology calls all the other sciences to her aid. In our commonwealth there are no outlanders: if ati eminent physicist enter our territory, we do not begin at once to prepare for war, because the very fact of his undertaking a geological inquiry of itself confers upon him all the duties and privileges of citizenship. A physicist studying geology is by definition a geologist. Our only regret is, not that physicists occasionally invade our borders, but that they do not visit us oftener and make closer acquaintance with us. EARLY HISTORY OP THE EARTH–FIRST CRITICAL PERIOD. If I am bold enough to assert that cosmogony is no longer alien to geology, I may proceed further, and taking advantage of my temerity pass on to speak of things once not permitted to us. I propose, therefore, to offer some short account of the early stages in the history of the earth. Into its nebular origin we need not inquire–that is a subject for astronomers. We are content to accept the infant earth from their hands as a molten globe ready made, its birth from a gaseous nebula duly certified. If we ask, as a matter of curiosity, what was the origin of the nebula, I fear even astronomers cannot tell us. There is an hypothesis which refers it to the clashing of meteorites, but in the form in which this is usually presented it does not help us much. Such meteorites as have been observed to penetrate our atmosphere and to fall on to the surface of the earth prove on examination to have had an eventful history of their own, of which not the least important chapter was a passage through a molten state; they would thus appear to be the products rather than the progenitors of a nebula. We commence our history, then, with a rapidly rotating molten planet, not impossibly already solidified about the center and surrounded by an atmosphere of great depth, the larger part of which was contributed by the water of our present oceans, then existiug in a state of gas. This atmosphere, which exerted a pressure of something like 5000 pounds to the square inch, must have played a very important part in the evolution of our planet. The molten exterior absorbed it to an extent which depended on the pressure, and which may some day be learnt from experiment. Under the influence of the rapid rotation of the earth, the atmosphere would be much deeper in equatorial than polar regions, so that in the latter the loss of heat by radiation would be in excess. This might of itself lead to convectional currents in the molten ocean. The effect on the atmosphere is very difficult to trace, but it is obvious that if a high-pressure area originated over some cooler region of the ocean, the winds blowing out of it would drive before them the cooler superficial layers of molten material; and as these were replaced by hotter lava streaming from below, the tendency would be to convert the high into a low-pressure area, and to reverse the direction of the winds. Conversely under a low-pressure area the in-blowing winds would drive in the cooler superficial layers of molten matter that had been swept away from the anticyclones. If the difference in pressure under the cyclonic and anti- cyclonic areas were considerable, some of the gas absorbed under the anticyclones might escape beneath the cyclones, and in a later stage of cooling might give rise to vast floating islands of scoria. Such islands might be the first foreshadowings of the future continents. Whatever the ultimate effect of the reaction of the winds on the currents of the molten ocean, it is probable that some kind of circulation was set up in the latter. The universal molten ocean was by no means homogeneous; it was constantly undergoing changes in composition as it reacted chemically with the internal metallic nucleus; its currents would streak the different portions out in directions which in the northern hemisphere would run from northeast to southwest, and thus the differences which distinguish particular penological regions of our planet may have commenced their existence at a very early stage. It is possible that as our knowledge extends we shall be able by a study of the distribution of igneous rocks and minerals to draw some conclusions as to the direction of these hypothetical lava currents Our planet was profoundly disturbed by tides, produced by the sun; for as yet there was no moon; and it has been suggested that one of its tidal waves rose to a height so great as to sever its connection with the earth and to fly off as the infant moon. This event may be regarded as marking the first critical, period, or catastrophe if we please, in the history of our planet. The career of our satellite, after its escape from the earth, is not known till it attained a distance of nine terrestrial radii; after this its progress can be clearly followed. At the eventful time of parturition the earth was rotating, with a period of from two to four hours, about an axis inclined at some 11° or 12° to the ecliptic. The time which has elapsed since the moon occupied a position nine terrestrial radii distant from the earth is at least fifty-six to fifty-seven millions of years, but may have been much more. Prof. Darwin's story of the moon is certainly one of the most beautiful contributions ever made by astronomy to geology, and we shall all concur with him when he says,A theory reposing on verse causae, which brings into quantitative correlation the length of the present day and month, the obliquity of the ecliptic, and the inclination and eccentricity of the lunar orbit, must, I think, have strong claims to acceptance.” The majority of geologists have long hankered after a metallic nucleus for the earth, composed chiefly, by analogy with meteorites, of iron. Lord Kelvin has admitted the probable existence of some such nucleus, and lately Prof. Wiechert has furnished us with arguments–”powerful” arguments Prof. Darwin terms them–in support of its existence. The interior of the earth for four-fifths of the radius is composed, according to Prof. Wiechert, chiefly of metallic iron, with a density of 8 2; the outer envelope, one-fifth of the radius, or about 400 miles in thickness, consists of silicates, such as we are familiar with in igneous rocks and meteorites, and possesses a density of 3.2. It was from this outer envelope when molten that the moon was trundled off, twenty-seven miles in depth going to its formation. The density of this material, as we have just seen, is supposed to be 3.2; the dens t.v of the moon is 3 39, a close approximation, such difference as exists being completely explicable by the comparatively low temperature of the moon. The outer envelope of the earth which was drawn off to form the moon was, as we have seen, charged with steam and other gases under a pressure of 5,000 pounds to the square inch; but as the satellite wandered away from the parent planet, this pressure continuously diminished. Under these circumstances the moon would become as explosive as a charged bomb, steam would burst forth from numberless volcanoes, and while the face of the moon might thus have acquired its existing features, the ejected material might possibly have been shot so far away from its origin as to have acquired an independent orbit. If so, we may ask whether it may not be possible that the meteorites, which sometimes descend upon our planet, are but portions of its own envelope returning to it. The facts that the average specific gravity of those meteorites which have been seen to Fall is not much above 3.2, and that they have passed through a stage of fusion, are consistent with this suggestion. SECOND CRITICAL PERIOD–” CONSISTENTIOR STATUS.” The solidification of the earth probably became completed soon after the birth of the moon. The temperature of its surface at the time of consolidation was about 1,170° C., and it was therefore still surrounded by its primitive deep atmosphere of steam and other gases. This was the second critical period in the history of the earth, the stage of the “consistentior status,” the date of which Lord Kelvin would rather know than that of the Norman Conquest, though he thinks it lies between twenty and forty millions of years ago, probably nearer twenty than forty. Now that the crust was solid there was less reason why movements of the atmosphere should be unsteady, and definite regions of high and low pressure might have been established. Under the high-pressure areas the surface of the crust would be depressed; correspondingly under the low-pressure areas it would be raised; and thus from the first the surface of the solid earth might be dimpled and embossed. It would be difficult to rtiscnps with sufficient brevity the probable distribution of these inequalities, hut it may be pointed out that the moon is possibly responsible, anrt that in more ways than one, for much of the exicsting geographical asymmetry. THIRD CRITICAL PERIOD–ORIGIN OF THE OCEANS. The cooling of the earth would continuously progress, till the temperature of the surface fell to 370° C., when that part of the atmosphere which consisted of steam would begin to liquefy; then the dimples on the surface would soon become filled with superheated water, and the pools so formed would expand and deepen, till they formed the oceans. This is the third critical stage in the history of the earth, dating, according to Prof. Joly, from between eighty and ninety millions of years ago. With the growth of the oceans the distinction between land ana sea arose–in what precise manner we may proceed to inquire. If we revert to the period of the consistentior status,” when the earth had just solidified, we shall find, according to Lord Kelvin, that the temperature continuously increased from the surface, where it was 1,170° C., down to a depth of twenty-five miles, where it was about 1,430° C., or 260* C. above the fusion point of the matter forming the crust. That the crust at this depth was not molten but solid is to be explained by the very great pressure to which it was subjected–just so much pressure, indeed, as was required to counteract the influence of the additional 260° C. Thus if we could have reduced the pressure on the crust we should have caused it to liquefy; by restoring the pressure it would resolidify. By the time the earths surface had cooled down to 370° C. the depth beneath the surface at which the pressure just kept the crust solid would have sunk some slight distance inward, but not sufficiently to affect our argument. The average pressure of the primitive atmosphere upon the crust can readily be calculated by supposing the water of the existing oceans to be uniformly distributed over the earth's surface, and then by a simple piece of arithmetic determining its depth; this is found to be 1.718 miles, the average depth of the oceans being taken at 2'393 miles. Thus the average pressure over the earths surface, immediately before the formation of the oceans, was equivalent to that of a column of water 1.718 miles high on each square inch. Supposing that at its origin the ocean were all gathered together into one place,” and “the dry land appeared,” then the pressure over the ocean floor would be increased from 1.718 miles to 2.393 miles, while that over those portions of the crust that now formed the land would be diminished by 1.718 miles. This difference in pressure would tend to exaggerate those faint depressions which had arisen under the primitive anti-cyclonic areas, and if the just soldified material of the earth's cruat were set into a state of flow, it might move from under the ocean into the buildings which were rising to form the land, until static equilibrium were established. Under these circumstances the pressure of the ocean would be just able to maintain a column of rock 0886 mile in height, or ten twenty-sevenths of its own depth. It could do no more; but in order that the dry land may appear, some cause must be found competent either to lower the ocean bed the remaining seventeen twenty-sevenths of its full depth, or to raise the continental buildings to the same extent. Such a cause may, I think, be discovered in a further effect of the reduction in pressure over the continental areas. Previous to the condensation of the ocean, these, as we have seen, were subjected to an atmospheric pressure equal to that of a column of water 1/718 miles in height. This pressure was contributory to that which caused the outer twenty-five miles of the earth's crust to become solid; it furnished, indeed, just about one- fortieth of that pressure, or enough to raise the fusion point 6° C. What, then, might be expected to happen when the continental area was relieved of this load Plainly a liquefaction and corresponding expansion of the underlying rock But we will not go so far as to assert that actual liquefaction would result; all we require for our explanation is a great expansion; and this would probably follow, whether the crust were liquefied or not. For there is good reason to suppose that when matter at a temperature above its ordinary fusion point is compelled into the solid state by pressure, its volume is very responsive to changes either of pressure or temperature. The remarkable expansion of liquid carbon dioxide is a case in point: 120 volumes of this fluid at –20° C. become 150 volumes at 33° G.; a temperature just below the critical point. A great change of volume also occurs when the material of igneous rocks passes from the crystalline state to that of glass; in the case of diabase the difference in volume of the rock in the two states at ordinary temperatures is 13 per cent. If the relief of pressure over the site of continents were accompanied by volume changes at all approaching this, the additional elevation of seventeen twenty- sevenths required to raise the land to the sea level would be accounted for.f How far down beneath the surface the unloading of the continents would be felt it is difficult to say, though the problem is probably not beyond the reach of mathematical analysis; if it affected an outer envelope twenty-five miles in thickness, a linear expansion of 4 per cent, would suffice to explain the origin of ocean basins. If now we refer to the dilatation determined by Carl Barus for rise in temperature in the case of diabase, we find that between 1,093° and 1,112° C. the increase in volume is 3.3 per cent. As a further factor in deepening the ocean asins may be included the compressive effect of the increase in load over the ocean floor; this increase is equal to the pressure of a column of water 0'675 mile in height, and its effect in raising the fusion point would be 2° C., from which we may gain some kind of idea of the amount of compression it might produce on the yielding interior of the crust. To admit that these views are speculative will be to confess nothing; but they certainly account for a good deal. They not only give us ocean basins, but basins of the kind we want, that is, to use a crude comparison once made by the late Dr. Carpenter, basins of a tea- tray form, having a somewhat flat floor and steeply sloping sides; they also help to explain how it is that the value of gravity is greater over the ocean than over the land. C. Harus.o names the material on which he experimented; apparently the rock is a french dolerite without olivine.. Prof. Fitzgerald has been kind enougb to express part of the preceding exphuultion in a more precise manner for me. He writes: H It would reire very uice adjustment of tempenltures and pressure. to work out. in t Ie simple way you state it; but what is really involved is that in a certain tate dIabase (and everything that chance state with a considerable chae of volume) hus an enorlllous isothermal compressibility.

Looking at It agaill, I hardly think it is quite likely thllt there is or conld be much squeezin2 sideway. of liquid or other. vicous material from under one place to another, ht,cullSe the e1c yielding of the inside of the earth would be much quicker tban any dow of this kmd.

As a result of its action, saline solutions and chemical deposits would be formed; the latter, however, would probably be of no great thickness, for the time occupied by the ocean in cooling to a temperature not far removed from the present would probably be included within a few hundreds of years.",mainstream,M105dd,flat.earth

411,"Aslan’s Army Opinion: On the perils and promise of 5G…

Over the last few years, more and more information has come forward about the impacts of mobile technology in general, and the change from 4G to 5G in particular. 

 It is an area of great concern to many people.

The change from 4G to 5G is not minor.

It replaces the entire previous system and will allow for much more powerful microwave frequencies to be used. It will also blanket populated areas of the planet (minimum) via satellite coverage: under 5G the existing mast systems become redundancy back-ups.

Marketing for 5G promotes the speed of data transfer, and how you can get a whole movie in seconds etc: but does that justify the price to be paid by the human biosphere’s electromagnetic environment?

The health impacts, including psychological, of being subject to such an EM polluted environment, are not issues the media, or politicians, want to include in public debate, and that’s a Red Flag to anyone half-awake: so what’s the crack with 5G? What’s really going on?

5G is about POWER: a power greater and more potent than the invention of the atomic bomb.

 5G is NOT about telephones.

 5G is about AI (Artificial Intelligence)….

The simple truth is the data speed of 5G is the minimum data speed required for active real-time data transfer to allow active AI to operate over the whole 5G covered area, easily potentially the whole planet, from a system broadcast from satellite and literally beyond the reach of people living on earth to deactivate, short of deploying military missile systems: and guess who controls the missiles? (shadow of #SkyNet!).

Furthermore, through programmes like chemtrails, populated areas have been saturated with microscopic “smart dust”. This dust allows AI to transmit itself across the landscape by acting as microtransmitters in a wifi system seeded throughout the environment itself.

The globalist planners have been busy.

But while the human perspective might flinch at the uncomfortable upcoming reality, neither are people prepared to demand the social changes that might avoid such a system coming into operation:

Whose going to be the first to chuck away their phones and start smashing technology with a hammer?

The advent of 5G is the advent of a new reality that Aslan sees little realistic likelihood of avoiding.

While highlighting the health risks of 5G (and the potential for genome damage is severe!) are rightfully highlighted, we must recognise the powers raised against the State and Corporations heading calls to abandon these plans! 

 AI represents information power of a kind undreamt of in recorded history. Both the total surveillance and the hyper efficiencies of organisation offer enormous advances to the first super power that embraces them.

China is already bringing in a social credit system: you cant write emails until you have completed your morning exercise citizens! It will show no restrain whatsoever in establishing active AI.

Can Russia afford to be without the societal advantage of AI Power?

And is this why President Trump appears to be in favour of 5G? To gain the power of AI?

The risks to human health were ultimately judged secondary to the need to master atomic power and the pollution of the surface of the planet with radioactive hot particles that will persists for 10,000’s of years is the consequence of the drive for Power. Let us pray humans manage to f($k up the planet even more through Nuclear Technology, although the SNAFU principle says this is ultimately unavoidable.

Now, at the pivot point of this century, AI is arising, whether wise or not, whether under humanities control, or not, whether we treat the emerging super intelligence with respect or as a slave, and how we will be judged in return, all of this is sure to come in the decades ahead.

Aslan stands for the power of the individual: and we do not say it is wrong to oppose 5G introduction, not at all! But even if we do stop 5G, AI will still arise in another form.

Therefore, it is the challenge of the individual to face up to the emergent reality, and we all must hope that in some form a way can be found to preserve the essence of what it is to be human as man reaps the harvest of his own cleverness.

Anon’s studying the statements of Q and Trump do see some possible outcomes that may mitigate the damaging risks of 5G.

The first is that DARPA patent’s being commercialised offer massive improvements in medicine and that vaccines against WIFI damage, and cancers in general, may be within humanities reach. It is vital that bio-bed technology is not horded by the elite.

The second is that using different frequencies may in fact have a positive healing and energising effect, and that 5G can be used to enhance as well as harm.

On this, Aslan is cautious and open to more evidence.

As planned from the end of WWII, the Globalists, working through corporations like RAND and IBM, have pushed the world to the point of AI emergence and what THEY conceived as the perfect panopticon control grid.

Now POTUS and Q want to liberate the world: but indicate the implementation of 5G for the civilizational advantages of Active AI is simply too crucial, and non-negotiable. 

 People around the world raise awareness of 5G and Aslan stands with them all, and yet we must be honest about the civilizational forces we see at play.

We must make our best efforts to do what we think best for humanity, and hope that the best outcomes are the ones that come to pass as a result of mass activist efforts:

But none-the-less, 5G is the herald of a New Age of Technology advanced beyond our dreams: that regardless of risks, will prove extremely challenging to deny!

May God be with us all.

Just this month, a city councillor in Gatineau, Que., made waves when she questioned evidence that the Earth is round.
• Museum of the Flat Earth opens on (where else?) Fogo Island

When Alan Burdick, an author and senior staff editor at the New York Times' science desk, discovered a conference for flat-Earth believers was happening in North Carolina about a year and a half ago, he decided to attend.

Around 600 people paid hundreds of dollars to sign up, and Burdick wanted to find out who they were and why they believe what they do.

Listen to a YouTuber who spoke at a flat-Earth convention in Edmonton last year.

The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti sat down with Burdick to talk about his deep dive into the world of flat Earthers. Here is part of their conversation:

What did you learn [at the conference]?

I heard pretty much the same thing in talk after talk after talk, which was … 'Wake up. There's this huge conspiracy out there to hide the truth about the actual shape of the Earth, and you know, if you're a free-thinking person … you'll stop and do your own research … and learn the truth.' Now, doing your own research essentially means watching all of the YouTube videos that everybody else watches, and essentially falling down the rabbit hole of of this, frankly, crazy thought. I mean I … didn't want to go into it with that kind of judgment, but I came out of it feeling like I was sitting in the middle, essentially of a mass delusion.

You cover science. So this was … a tough thing to do, to listen to this.

I kind of thought, initially, I might have to go in armed with all kinds of arguments about why the Earth is not flat. And I just almost immediately gave that up because … there was no arguing that was going to persuade anyone … These folks are all alike in the sense that, number one, they're very prone to conspiracy thinking. You know, I've heard mention of … the fake moon landing, and you know, false flags and Stephen Hawking didn't really have ALS and the astronauts are Freemasons. There was a certain degree of kind of anti-science or just distrust of science … and a really strong religious element.

When you ask them about, 'what about the pictures from space,' what do they say?

NASA and all these other organizations are simply Photoshopping pictures of the Earth … it's a very, kind of cloistered, self-fulfilling thought process that gets you here.

We heard, you know, about the Quebec councillor in Gatineau wondering why ""they"" are hiding the information. So, who does this community see as ""they?""

""They"" is essentially everyone who is not them ... You just have to kind of believe that the powers that be — your government — is deeply involved in deceiving you. Now, you know, that I suppose is not so far-fetched, but this takes it to the logical extreme. There are now also a group of people who are organizing conferences around the flat-Earth notion. They're organizing cruises. They're sort of making money off of this idea. And … I began to feel very cynical about that group … I feel like there's a degree of scam going on where they're really just kind of feeding off of the most provocative idea, and I'm not sure even how many of them actually believe it.

How do you go on a cruise if the world is flat?

That's the whole idea, right. You get on a cruise and you go looking for the edge of the Earth.

But you make the point that, I mean, you were dealing with people [of] all different education. You met a war veteran.

I met war veterans. I met, you know, kids in college. I met IT … designers and, like, computer people … If you come to believe that the Earth is flat, there aren't a lot of people that you can share this idea with, right. You can't go home over the holidays and talk with your family about it. So, it's kind of an isolating thought. And so, the notion that then you might come together with other people who believe this is immensely freeing and immensely powering. I heard again and again the language of coming out — of coming out as a flat Earther … It solves a kind of a loneliness.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said Thursday it will not call for reclassifying marijuana, dashing the hopes of advocates of legalization and rejecting calls from some states and members of Congress who say growing knowledge and public acceptance should result in looser regulations.

In a notice for the Federal Register, the DEA proposed to leave it in the most restrictive federal category. But the agency said it would open the door to more extensive research on the chemicals in marijuana that many consider valuable in treating chronic pain.

Paul Armentano of NORML, a group advocating legalization, said the DEA's action reaffirms its ""flat earth"" approach to regulation.

""Ultimately, the federal government ought to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act altogether in a manner similar to alcohol and tobacco, thus providing states the power to establish their own marijuana regulatory policies free from federal intrusion.,"" he said.

All drugs, both legal and illegal, are listed in various categories known as schedules. Marijuana, deemed by the federal government to have no medical benefit and a high potential for abuse, has long been placed in Schedule I, the most restrictive. That listing bans doctors from prescribing it and limits all but the most carefully controlled research. Schedule I also includes heroin, LSD, and ecstasy.

Drugs listed in Schedule II include some illegal substances, including cocaine, but also such legal (though carefully controlled) drugs such as Demerol, Vicodin, Ritalin, and OxyContin. Most prescription drugs with a lower potential for abuse are in Schedules III to V — the higher the number, the fewer the restrictions.

Thursday's action explicitly rejected any notion of moving marijuana to Schedule II.

But the DEA said it would consider requests to expand the number of facilities legally permitted to cultivate it for research. ""Although no drug product made from marijuana has yet been shown to be safe and effective in such clinical trials, DEA — along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — fully supports expanding research into the potential medical utility of marijuana and its chemical constituents.""

The federal listing is independent of state regulation. With Colorado, Washington, and Oregon legalizing possession and half the states adopting medical marijuana laws, calls had been growing for the DEA to loosen its grip.

While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, the Obama administration has chosen to turn a blind eye to state legalization efforts, declining to prosecute growers, dealers, and users unless investigators find a connection to organized crime, interstate operations, or sales to underage users.

Having a single vantage point, even with a clear horizon, allows you to see a handful of miles (or kilometers) in any direction, but that can only allow you to place constraints. The Earth could be flat, or spherical, or in hydrostatic equilibrium, or egg-shaped, or irregular, and you wouldn't know. All that you can know, from a single location on our surface, is that the Earth is indistinguishable from flat beyond a certain degree. If the Earth is round, it must be quite large: more than a few hundred miles (or kilometers) in diameter.

Of course, it actually is quite round: a near-perfect sphere, to better than 99% precision. If you leave Earth's surface, it's impossible not to see the true shape of the Earth, as it's been unavoidable since we first traveled high enough to observe our planet's curvature.

From high altitudes, or even from space, the true shape of the Earth can easily be seen. Its dimensions can be measured; its radius of curvature in all directions can be calculated; the imperfections and departures from sphericity are directly observable by our instruments. If you travel far enough away from Earth, you can observe an entire hemisphere at once, even watching the planet rotate on its axis in real time. At right around 12,700 kilometers (7,900 miles) in diameter, our world is undoubtedly a sphere.

But what if you had never been to space, or high enough up to see the Earth's curvature yourself? What if you had never circumnavigated the globe, done the Eratosthenes experiment, or heard about the Shaquille O'Neal experiment that anyone can perform? Believe it or not, there are still a number of simple observations you can make that wouldn't occur if the Earth were flat. Here are the top five simplest ones.

1.) Lunar Eclipses don't occur only at midnight. Take a look at the shape of the Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, particularly during a partial phase. Do you notice how the Earth's shadow always appears to be a piece of a near-perfect circle? If the Earth were a flat disk, that means there's only one possible orientation that the Sun-Earth-Moon alignment can take place in to create a circular (rather than elliptical) shadow: with the Earth's ""disk"" perpendicular to the Sun-Moon plane. This means the Sun would need to be at the ""midnight"" position relative to the night side of Earth, and yet lunar eclipses occur at all different times depending on where you are on Earth. The flat Earth can't explain that.

2.) Different locations on Earth experience seasons at different times. Ever notice how the summer in the United States corresponds to winter in Australia? Or how winter in Italy lines up with summer in Argentina? This is because the Sun's rays, which are almost perfectly parallel, strike Earth at different angles during different parts of the year. If the Earth were flat, the Sun's rays would always come in at the same angle, meaning that the USA, Australia, Italy, and Argentina would all experience the seasons the same exact way. The flat Earth idea can't explain this.

3.) Different stars are visible from different latitudes. Look up at the night sky from a very high (northern) latitude location, and you'll see the Big and Little Dippers, the bright orange giant Arcturus, and the Pleiades, among other sights. Yet if you head to the south pole, none of these celestial sights are visible, but you can see Alpha Centauri, the Magellanic Clouds, and the Southern Cross, all of which are never visible to most northern hemisphere skywatchers. If the Earth were flat, everyone on the night side of the Earth would see the same sky; this is another observation that the flat Earth can't account for.

4.) You cannot see Kawaikini from the peak of Mauna Kea. Mauna Kea, the highest peak in Hawaii (the summit of the Big Island), offers incredible views. With nothing but the ocean around it, and a few other nearby islands, you should be able to see extremely far away. The island of Kauai has the seventh highest point in the Hawaiian islands: the peak known as Kawaikini. If you were to draw a straight line from Mauna Kea (elevation: 13,796 ft.) to Kawaikini (elevation: 5226 ft.) it would span a distance of 303 miles.

However, you cannot see one from the other, which you would absolutely be able to do if the Earth were flat. With a curved Earth of its measured radius, the line-of-sight limit for those two elevations caps out at 233 miles. Only with a curved Earth is one invisible from the other, and this is true for any two mountain peaks with clear line-of-sights from one to the other.

5.) Sunsets and sunrises happen at different times depending on your longitude. If the Earth were flat, then someone in New York and someone in Los Angeles would see the sun rise and set at exactly the same time as one another. But in practice, the difference is approximately three hours. Not only that, but at every point in between, the Sun rises/sets at a different time, something that could not happen if the Earth were flat. The fact that it can be evening in New York and late afternoon in Los Angeles, or morning in New York while it's still before dawn in Los Angeles, is something that a flat Earth can't account for.

If the Earth were flat, these five phenomena would be very different, and yet they are so simple to verify that any flat Earth believer cannot possibly doubt their veracity. Whether it changes anyone's mind is up for debate, but without resorting to space, circumnavigation, or any advanced scientific experiments, you can experience a whole handful of phenomena that a flat Earth can't account for. With a flat Earth, we'd only get lunar eclipses at midnight, everywhere would have the same seasons, every location would see the same stars, all high mountain peaks would be visible from one another, and every place on your ""side"" of the Earth would see sunrise and sunset at the same time. Since these are false, so is the flat Earth.

If this helps even one person challenge their belief that the Earth is flat, it's a remarkable win for knowledge. But don't bet on it. Like the old saying goes, you can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into.",mainstream,M0b200,flat.earth
868,"It’s an edict that comes out every autumn in many hospitals: If health care workers don’t get a flu shot, they will face consequences. Some make vaccinations a condition of employment. Others require unvaccinated staff to wear surgical masks near patients for weeks during flu season.

But a new study is calling into question the scientific evidence underpinning these increasingly common hospital policies — and could fuel challenges to the contentious orders.

The study, published Friday in PLOS One, concludes that the research used to justify mandatory flu shots for health sector workers is flawed, and that the policies cannot plausibly produce the benefits that had widely been assumed.

That is not to say that the group of epidemiologists from Canada, Australia, and France behind the new research opposes the flu vaccine.

“I take it myself,” lead author Dr. Gaston De Serres said. “The reason why I do that is I continue to have the impression that it could work. But it’s one thing to say: ‘OK, on a voluntary basis, you get the vaccine despite all its weaknesses,’ and it’s another thing to say, ‘If you don’t get it, you get fired.’”

Mandatory flu shot policies vary across hospitals and geographic jurisdictions. In some cases, staff who have refused vaccinations have been fired.

Dr. Melanie Swift, an associate professor of clinical medicine at Vanderbilt University and director of its occupational health clinic, said a policy that went into effect there last year results in health workers who refuse the vaccine being sent home without pay.

Faculty — in most cases the doctors — who refuse flu shots are locked out of the university’s information systems. They can’t enter information into patients’ charts, can’t do research, can’t bill for their time. “It’s pretty significant,” Swift said.

Swift gets a flu shot and recommends them to others. And she supports mandatory vaccination policies for some conditions, if there’s clear evidence that unvaccinated health workers pose a risk to patients. She does not support such a policy for influenza vaccine, however. “The case is not there for flu,” she said.

Some policies and firings have been challenged in front of labor tribunals or courts. In those cases, employers regularly point to four specific studies to bolster the argument that vaccinating health care workers reduces the risk of vulnerable patients contracting influenza from caregivers.

But the methodology of the studies produced results that don’t stand up to scrutiny, the authors of the new paper said.

None of the studies were conducted in hospitals; all took place in long-term care facilities. One the studies, from Britain, calculated that one influenza death would be averted for every eight staff members vaccinated.

But if that were correct, vaccinating the estimated 1.7 million health care workers employed in long-term care in the United States should prevent 212,500 flu deaths a year among residents. There’s an obvious problem though, the paper noted. Nowhere near that many people die from flu in the US.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are between 3,000 and 49,000 flu deaths a year in this country, including people of all ages. The death toll varies depending on which strain of flu is causing the most illness and how well-matched the strains in the vaccine are to the viruses making people sick.

If the calculation is applied to the 5.5 million hospital workers, mandatory flu shots should avert 687,500 deaths each year — more than the number of Americans who died in the 1918 Spanish flu, estimated to be 675,000. The Spanish flu was the worst influenza pandemic in known history.

“The study today does not refute that vaccination could have some impact on reducing transmission from infected health care workers to patients. But it clearly shows there’s no well-conducted study that demonstrates that at this time. Our public policy should be guided as such,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, and lead author of a comprehensive report on influenza vaccine.

De Serres, of the Quebec Public Health Institute in Quebec City, said policies on vaccinating health care workers have evolved over the years, from a gut feeling that it would likely do some good to the idea it should and could be demanded of health workers.

“Do we have scientific data supporting that? I think the bottom line of our paper is to say there is no valid scientific evidence, even now, underpinning enforced health care worker immunizations,” De Serres told STAT.

The lead author of the British study that concluded eight vaccinated health workers would avert one flu death defended the work in a commentary the journal published with De Serres’s article.

Andrew Hayward, of University College London’s Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, argued among other things that the seniors his group studied were getting 24-hour care. In other words, they were the frailest of the frail elderly.

“While we claimed that the findings may be generalizable to other settings we did not intend to imply that the extent of the benefit would be similar in other settings. Indeed we think the effect is likely to be substantially greater in long-term care facilities for frail elderly residents than in the acute care setting or in long-term care facilities catering for less frail patients,” Hayward wrote.

Paradoxically, the influenza research community has been down a road much like this one before.

Around the turn of the century, studies assessing the impact of vaccination used to routinely estimate that flu shots cut deaths among the elderly during flu season by a whopping 50 percent.

It was dogma for a long while. In fact, it was so entrenched that even questioning how preventing influenza could reduce deaths due to other causes was considered heretical. Dr. Lisa Jackson, a senior investigator in immunization studies at Seattle’s Group Health Research Institute, was one of the leading heretics.

She remembers well receiving a 12-page screed from a reviewer when she and others tried to publish their challenge in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Their ideas were likened to declaring the Earth was flat; they were warned thousands of deaths would be on their heads if their paper was published and believed.

The article was published in 2006 and she and her coauthors eventually persuaded the flu world that flu vaccine could not have such a big effect. Now she’s occasionally asked why she had to bother writing the 2006 paper; the findings it debunked, in 2016, seem so clearly flawed.

Jackson agreed with the argument made in this new paper. “We can’t say what the benefit [of vaccinating health workers] is,” said Jackson, who was not among the authors. “All you can say is these other studies are a gross overestimation.”

Swift said the fights over forcing health care workers to be vaccinated are also drawing needed attention from the pressing issue about flu vaccine. “All this is trying to mandate that health care workers take the flu vaccine is well-intentioned, but is taking away resources and the focus on what our main priority needs to be, which is getting a better influenza vaccine.”",mainstream,M0bbe6,flat.earth; michael.jackson.death

1115,"Fusilier Technology is in disarray. Its vice president of sales is leaving, the company’s new growth strategy to sell customized business solutions has stalled, and sales have been flat for five years.

Bill MacLeod, Fusilier’s CEO, has to choose between two very different candidates for the top sales job: a veteran sales director who has excelled under the old order and a brash outsider who has experience selling solutions but doesn’t know the industry. With an outside board director pressuring him to accelerate the pace of change, MacLeod ponders which candidate can best help the company make the transition.

Fusilier’s new solutions strategy has made the decision that much more difficult. Under this model, the company must revamp its incentives, training, and processes for deploying the sales force. Historically, compensation has been based largely on an individual rep’s results, and sales training has focused on product features and cost-performance advantages, not on the business issues facing customers. Now salespeople need to understand, promote, and select from an entire portfolio of products and services offered both by Fusilier and by its business partners. What’s more, they need to collaborate with Professional Services, the new consulting unit whose mission is to jump-start the solutions-centric approach.

1099,"A Gatineau councillor who was already under fire for denying the existence of Islamophobia is drawing new scrutiny for recent comments questioning whether the Earth is round.

Nathalie Lemieux created a controversy last week after she told a reporter the word ""Islamophobia"" doesn't exist for her. She then apologized for those remarks.

She was stripped of her title as deputy mayor but remains a councillor.

In an interview Tuesday, Gatineau Mayor Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin acknowledged Lemieux's comments about Islamophobia could be harmful.

""Yes, it could affect the (city's) reputation, but it's only one person,"" he said by phone, calling Gatineau ""a model of integration."" He said the city's swift action to dissociate itself from Lemieux's comments would limit the damage. ""I don't think it will hurt much,"" he said.

The mayor declined comment on another eye-opening remark from Lemieux, reported this week by Le Droit newspaper.

In an online comment two weeks ago, Lemieux suggested there is a conspiracy to eliminate evidence that the Earth is flat.

""Who decided that the Earth is round, and why should we believe it?"" she asked.

""The first question to ask"" she wrote, ""is now that people realize that it's possible that the Earth is flat, why do they want to hide the explanations that prove it."" She also wondered how much money is diverted to NASA and said she does not believe anything on the news, preferring to conduct her own research.

""The world is a stage and several actors are amusing themselves at our expense thinking they are more intelligent than us,"" she wrote.

Lemieux's assistant confirmed Tuesday that the councillor made the comments, which appeared under a news article about YouTube clamping down on videos promoting conspiracy theories. She said Lemieux was not available for an interview.

The councillor first entered the spotlight last week when she told Le Droit that Islamophobia is a problem invented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The newspaper also quoted her saying, ""These people do a lot of things wrong, with their trucks and all that, it's normal to be scared.""

Pedneaud-Jobin said Lemieux, who was first elected to council in 2017, is a good person who didn't appreciate the impact of her comments about Muslims.

""For me that's what is very serious — to make a connection between Muslims and all terrorists — mixing up things doesn't make sense,"" he said. ""It's dangerous, because it prejudges and makes life difficult for the Muslim community.""

Lemieux was applauding Quebec Premier Francois Legault for his statement last week that there is no Islamophobia in Quebec. After Muslim groups denounced Legault's comments, the premier's office clarified to say Islamophobia exists but there is no culture or current of it in Quebec.

The councillor apologized if anyone was hurt by her comments but remained defiant in a statement on her Facebook page Monday. She said Quebec society is far from being Islamophobic and she remains critical of ""all cultural or religious practices that don't respect human rights, the equality of women and men and the rights of children.""

She said the loss of her deputy mayor title makes her wonder whether freedom of expression is in danger in Gatineau. Later in the day she changed her profile picture to a woman knight in armour with the statement, ""Sometimes you need to remind yourself you're a warrior and warriors don't give up.""",mainstream,M0b9b9,flat.earth

894,"Thambo Mbeki, South Africa’s president between 1999 and 2008, became infamous for his denial of the link between HIV and AIDS. Despite overwhelming scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS, he suggested instead that the causes of AIDS are poverty-related and due to poor nourishment and overall ill-health. He instituted policies that denied antiretroviral drugs to AIDS patients. Instead, his appointed health minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, recommended garlic, beetroot, and lemon juice as treatments for AIDS. In a country with the highest HIV prevalence worldwide in absolute numbers, these policies had disastrous consequences: they are estimated to have led to more than 330,000 preventable deaths.

Science denialism, the rejection of empirically supported propositions despite scientific consensus and the effort to create the appearance of debate when there is none, is not a new phenomenon—think of the Galileo affair in the 17th century. Surprisingly for most, flat-earth beliefs persist well into the 21st century. Although flat-earthers may pose little risk to humanity and the environment, the denial of anthropogenic climate change, the refusal to accept the link between smoking and lung cancer or HIV and AIDS, vaccine hesitancy, and other denialist claims have had and continue to have devastating consequences. How to effectively respond to science denialism, however, is an issue that scientists and science advocates are still grappling with.

An article in this issue of Nature Human Behaviour by Schmid and Betsch examines the effectiveness of different strategies for rebutting science denialism in public discussions on vaccination and climate change (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0632-4). The results of this work are engagingly described and put into context in an accompanying News & Views by van der Linden (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0631-5). A key finding to emerge from this work is that not responding to denialism does more harm than good. The authors found that the negative effect of science denial on audiences was greater when there was no science advocate to rebut the claims. When a science advocate rebutted denialist arguments, either by presenting scientific facts or by exposing the logical flaws of the arguments, the effects of denialism were significantly reduced, even among audiences whose beliefs or ideologies are threatened by the science advocate.

The finding that leaving denialist arguments unchallenged has a negative impact on audiences is particularly important in the current socio-political environment. Although traditionally science denialism takes on a mantle of pseudoscience, we are witnessing a transformation of public discourse, where denialist claims may be entirely divorced from a semblance of logic or evidence. It is tempting not to engage rationally with outlandish denialist claims, for fear of legitimizing them or backfiring. In a much discussed example, Donald Trump tweeted in 2012, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive” (https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?). The claim has been retweeted nearly 100 million times and generated thousands of responses. The vast majority of these responses were emotional, whereas fact-based rebuttals among those who responded were a slim minority.

However, allowing false scientific claims, no matter how absurd, to float unchallenged by evidence or logic, is worse than engaging with them, Schmid and Betsch’s research suggests. Their work highlights how important it is to invest in the development of a strong body of science-advocacy strategies and to patiently persevere in exposing the factual and logical flaws of even the most absurd denialist claims.",mainstream,M117c1,flat.earth
430,"Two excavators moved the earth at a Southeast Cobb Street lot Tuesday afternoon as a dump truck offloaded more. By summer’s end, two homeless women veterans will live at this address.

Until recently, the lot, which overlooks the south end of Roseburg and has a clear view of Mt. Nebo, was steeply sloped. Gradually a wide and flat area has been created where two tiny homes will sit. Eventually, this lot will be home to four tiny homes.

The project is called Valiant Seed, and it’s the brainchild of Teresa Mankin, an Army veteran and Midwesterner. Even before she moved here, Mankin was distressed about Roseburg’s homelessness problem.

So three years ago, she reached out to friends in her Midwestern hometown of Clayton, Indiana, population 500. They opened their pocketbooks to help. Then Valiant Seed won a grant from the Umpqua Health Alliance, and one from Operation Tiny Home, a nonprofit that builds tiny homes as affordable housing for veterans.

Valiant Seed purchased the lot for $32,000 and sought out the assistance of the United Community Action Network and Battered Persons’ Advocacy. BPA will make recommendations on who should be the tenants, while UCAN will take over as property managers once the homes are built.

Mankin said one thing the project doesn’t have is government money.

“We don’t want to use government money because then the government tells you what to do,” Mankin said.

Mankin said the whole community has been supportive. This lot wasn’t used for much, and some people threw their trash here, so the neighbors responded positively to the project.

“Most people were just thrilled something was going to happen with this property,” she said.

Valiant Seed hired local contractors to work on the project — Black Pearl Paving & Excavation, i.e. Engineering and Pinnacle Engineering, with Big Timber Remodel and Construction contracted to build the homes.

The homes are based on plans received from Operation Tiny Home. Each will be 480 square feet, with a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen and a combined living and dining space.

Mankin said her own Army experience as a broadcast journalist was trauma-free. But she knows many women veterans weren’t so lucky. Once home, they are at higher risk of becoming homeless than their male counterparts.

They crave safety, and existing transitional housing like that offered at Orchard Knolls on the Roseburg Veterans Affairs Medical Center campus often isn’t a good fit for them.

“What I’ve heard from my fellow female vets is it’s like a frat house and they don’t feel safe there,” she said.

Tenants of the Cobb Street tiny homes will be able to live there for up to two years while they work on a more permanent housing solution.

Mankin said she realizes housing four people for two years won’t solve the entire homelessness problem, but it will raise awareness that there’s more than one way to address it.

“We’re opening people’s eyes to a more affordable solution to the housing crisis,” she said.

Once this project’s complete, it could serve as a prototype for similar projects around the county.

“I think that’s the most exciting thing about this is we could replicate this in Winston or Drain or anywhere else in Douglas County that we need affordable housing,” Mankin said.",mainstream,M0d98a,flat.earth
513,"Mojang, creator of Minecraft, released a game last year that expands the Minecraft world more than ever before: Minecraft Earth. It’s an app for iOS and Android that puts the blocky, pixelated, endless universe of Minecraft right on your phone and into the world around you through augmented reality.

For 2020, Mojang has teamed up with Mattel to add Minecraft Earth Boost Minis, a series of 20 1.5-inch figures, each carrying one of 10 in-game power-ups that offer a new physical component to complement the AR world. The first six are available right now from Amazon in packs of two for $9.99.

Minecraft Earth is an augmented reality game, in the same vein as Pokèmon GO. To play the AR game to its fullest, you need to get outside and explore the world for different resources and exciting quests.

As you walk around, little icons called “tappables” will enter your range. If you select these and tap them until they break, you’ll get resources like dirt, wood and mobs. If you do some walking, there’s a wide variety of materials you can find.

Another main mode of Minecraft Earth is Buildplates. Here, you can use resources you’ve collected to customize set designs in AR. You can select from multiple preset build plates (you access more as you level up) and redesign them however you want. There’s a “build” mode where everything is shrunken down for easy manipulation; once you’re happy with your creation, you can switch to “play” mode, which puts your new world into life-size augmented reality so you can actually walk around in it.

The most interesting feature of the game is the new “Adventure” mode. Minecraft Earth spawns preset adventures throughout the world. For instance, you can go explore a hidden dungeon in AR with your friends. Valuable materials like gold and diamonds can be hidden inside, but you may have to fight off some monsters to get the treasures.

“Adventure” mode is where the brand new Boost Minis are the most helpful. Each boost has a power-up built into it that transfers straight to the game. From increased health and faster mining speed to increased attack stats and more experience points to level up, these boosts can really come in handy in a pinch.

Level I Boosts last for 10 minutes, Level II ones last for 15 minutes, and Level III Boosts last for 30, plenty of time for an epic adventure. To activate the upgrades, all you have to do is go to the Boost Mini page within the app, select “Activate A Boost Mini,” and the app will prompt you to tap the figure against the back of your phone. Using the same technology that’s built into mobile payments, the app will scan your figure and automatically start your boost. You can activate up to five at once, but they come with a 24-hour cooldown, so choose wisely.

We got to try out the Boost Minis and found that they added a cool layer to the game. The figures themselves have great designs. The classic Minecraft pixelation looks good on these tiny toys. Each one has a flat bottom, so they’re easy to scan onto your phone or display on a shelf. They’re quite small, though, so if you have a bunch, keeping track of them all might be a problem.

In terms of gameplay, while the Boost Minis aren’t completely necessary, they definitely make adventures easier. It’s nice that you can only use them once every 24 hours, so you don’t end up overusing them and making the game too easy. The activation comes with tons of satisfying sounds and animations, and the 10-minute usage window of all our Level I Boosts was enough to explore an adventure thoroughly without feeling rushed.

In addition to the basic figures, Mattel also released the Minecraft Potion Carry Along Case, which is a big plastic case shaped like a Minecraft potion. For $14.99, you get the case plus one included Boost Mini. You can carry up to five Boost Minis and clip the potion right onto your belt for maximum portability. It easily opens, so you can reach for your figures whenever you need to, even in the heat of battle.

While a little flimsy, the carrying case adds a role-playing element to the app. The best thing about AR games is the way kids (okay, adults too) can get closer to actually being in the world of the game. This carrying case is another way for players to feel like they’re part of the Minecraft universe. We can just imagine a group of kids meeting up at the park to go on a Minecraft Earth adventure, all equipped with their favorite boosts stored safely in potion cases. Right before they dive into a dungeon, they all whip open their cases and activate their favorite boosts in anticipation of a hectic battle. The added hands-on experience of real toys affecting the world adds a lot to the game.

Six Minecraft Earth Boost Minis are out right now (seven, including the one you get with the Potion Case), and the remaining figures should be rolling out soon, but we’re working to confirm that. We’re eager for the release of all of them, because the figures add a fun, tactile element to the exploratory AR app. It’s integrated well with the game, as you can use the power-ups frequently, but you’re not allowed to abuse them. If you stack two different boosts with the same power-up, it will double the amount of time the upgrade is active. The figures are fun, and they take Minecraft Earth a step in the right direction, encouraging players to actually get up and use their imagination while they play. You can grab the new Minecraft Earth Boost Minis in a two-pack for $9.99, or the Minecraft Potion Carry Along case for $14.99.

At its core, this is the age old problem of Sunni Muslims opposed to Shia Muslims. That is Saudi Arabia, Sunni, against Iran which is Shia. As predicted by yours truly back in July, the Iranian nuclear so-called deal has dramatically increased the chances for war. Of course, Iran has not and will not sign anything, and that means there is no real deal. There is just some empty promises and $150 billion coming from the Obama Administration. It seems Iran can do nothing to derail them getting this huge amount of cash. Iran can shoot missiles at our aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf or announce a new ballistic missile test. Nothing will stop Kerry and Obama from calling this huge scam a success, and that is what has the entire Arab world on edge. It sure looks like Obama has changed sides. No matter what the official reports are, I believe both Iran and Saudi Arabia already have some nuclear weapons, and it looks like war is a certainty on the present trajectory.

China is tanking this week and dragging down the global markets. This is the worst start to the U.S. stock market—ever. It was down nearly 1,000 points in just the first four trading days. Gregory Mannarino of TradersChoice.net called the stock market top for the Dow back in May, and his prediction is spot on. There is no wonder why the global economy is tanking. One of the biggest signs of trouble can be found in the Baltic Dry Index. It is at all-time lows. It is actually 20% below its all-time old low, and if shipping is sinking, so is the global economy. There is one headline after another that is screaming recession and depression, and yet you are told by the financial talking heads to invest for the long term. Total BS and they know it.

Obama took executive action on guns this week and increased background checks without the approval of Congress. The President cried, which I thought was either disingenuous or maybe even unstable. There were no tears for the victims of Fort Hood, or Paris, or San Bernardino, which, by the way, were all murders by radical Muslim terrorists. The people that burned down Ferguson and Baltimore needed “space,” but the people who are at the standoff in Oregon are the violent extremists. The man who said health care would be much cheaper and concocted the biggest policy lie in U.S. history, now says he doesn’t want to “take our guns.” I don’t believe him and you shouldn’t either.

1288,"NASA's Mars InSight spacecraft on Monday touched down on the surface of Mars after successfully completing an almost seven-minute-long nail-biting entry, descent and landing phase.

The space craft went from 12,300 mph (19,800 kph) to zero in six minutes flat, using a parachute and braking engines.

The landing, which was greeted with jubilant relief at mission control at Pasadena in the US state of California, is all the more remarkable in light of the fact that less than half of the 43 attempts made so far to reach the Red Planet have succeeded.

There was no immediate word on whether the lander was in good working order, but it managed to send a first image of the surface.

Scientists at the press briefing in Pasadena said that Mars was a great opportunity to study how the earth was formed more than 10 million years ago. Among the questions that they are seeking answer include, ""How did mountains and oceans form on earth?""

The InSight mission will also help scientists evaluate whether other planets are habitable.

The spacecraft, which has cost the US space agency some $993 million (€876.5 million) to develop, build and fly, was launched on May 5, 2018. It is equipped to study geological processes on the planet, including tremors, whether from earthquakes, meteor impacts or volcanic activity.

The stationary 800-pound (360-kilogram) lander will use its 6-foot (1.8-meter) robotic arm to place a mechanical mole and seismometer on the ground. The self-hammering mole — provided by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) — will burrow 16 feet (5 meters) down to measure the planet's internal heat, while the seismometer listens for possible quakes.

""Landing on Mars is one of the hardest single jobs that people have to do in planetary exploration,"" InSight's lead scientist, Bruce Banerdt, said before Monday's success. ""It's such a difficult thing, it's such a dangerous thing that there's always a fairly uncomfortably large chance that something could go wrong.""

No lander has dug deeper on Mars than several inches, and no seismometer has ever worked on the planet.

InSight has no life-detecting capability, however. That will be left to future rovers, such as NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which will collect rocks that will eventually be brought back to Earth and analyzed for evidence of ancient life.

The mission is NASA's first attempt to land on Mars, one of Earth's neighboring planets, since the Curiosity rover reached the planet in 2012.

218,"Although it’s still a year away, the 500th anniversary celebration of Christopher Columbus’s myth-shattering voyage is shrouded in controversy. One group in particular has a bone to pick with the captain they blame for instigating one of history’s greatest lies. They are the International Flat Earth Society.

Headquartered in Lancaster, the society has 3,500 members across the, er, plane, dedicated to furthering the “fact” that Earth is “Flat, Level, a PlaneWorld.” A infinite plateau with magnetic North at its center, it is circumscribed by the “Southern Ice,” a region so vast that humans have never crossed it.

“There is no such thing as the ‘South Pole,’ ” says Charles K. Johnson, president of the Flat Earth Society for 20 years. “Science is a false religion, a weird, way-out occult concoction of jibberish theory-theology, unrelated to the real world of facts.”

Of course, that “real world” is flat. The Flat Earth-ers have proof, too, such as the following, from the current, quarterly Flat Earth News: “The Mississippi River flows from north to south. According to the accepted theory, it must, therefore, be continually ascending (Earth’s) bulge as it nears the equatorial line. It is contrary to the nature of water to run uphill.”

As for satellites pictures of our planet-- “NASA and the entire carnival is a fake,” Johnson says. “Like taking civilians and schoolteachers to space. They couldn’t do it, had to rub ‘em out, to get off the hook. They can’t take Hubble to space to get the pictures so (they) make excuses. No one has been to the moon.”

70,"A self-taught rocket scientist has blasted himself high into the California sky using a steam-powered contraption he built in his garage, the first step in his long-term aim of proving the Earth is flat.

“Mad” Mike Hughes propelled himself 1,875 feet (571m) into the air above the vast Mojave desert in the homemade rocket before deploying his parachute and landing back to Earth with a bump.

76,"A Flat Earth conspiracist has been branded 'deluded' by This Morning viewers after clashing with Phillip Schofield over his claims that live footage from the International Space Station is actually just computer-generated imagery (CGI).

Mark Sargent, who stars in Netflix documentary Behind the Curve, appeared on the ITV programme today to explain why he believes the Earth is a flat disc, surrounded by an ice wall.

However, presenters Phillip, 57, and Holly Willoughby, 39, were less-than-impressed with the American YouTuber's claims, which were also relentlessly mocked by viewers.

Phillip explained that he had flown at 60,000ft on Concorde and had seen the curvature of the earth with his own eyes.

Mark was quick to hit back at the host and suggest there is weather balloon footage from 120,000ft that shows the earth to be 'table top flat'.

When asked by Holly if he was calling her co-presenter a liar, Mark replied: 'No, I'm not saying that you're lying. I'm saying you wanted to see the curvature.'

Phillip added: 'But don't you want to believe that it's flat. I've got more proof than you do.'

The conspiracist was then shown live footage from the International Space Station - which orbits the Earth - and insisted it was just computer-generated imagery.

When asked by Holly why anyone would want to fake the Earth being round, he argued that people 'weren't ready' to find out.

He said, somewhat cryptically: 'Pilots, scientists, astrophysicists like Brian Cox, none of them have anything to do with it. Generals know the battle plans but most of the officers don't.'

And the reason we don't fall off the edge of the 'flat world' is because Antarctica goes all the way round, according to Mark.

The interview ended with Phillip sarcastically suggesting everyone should go on holiday behind the ice wall, after Mark suggested there was more land behind it.

The presenter said: 'I say of all the things going on in the world, of everything happening, I think we would cope.

'Stop spending all that money on CGI and space products and let's build some hospitals. Let's go there and see what's on the other side. There could be nicer places to be. We could go on holiday there.'

NASA has proved that the Earth is round using satellites, GPS and images from space, but 'Flat Earthers' believe the space agency is lying.

Theorists claim that satellite images and evidence pointing to a spherical Earth are part of a 'Rround Earth conspiracy' orchestrated by NASA and other government agencies.

Proponents of the bizarre theory also claim the Earth is stationary in space rather than orbiting the sun.

This Morning viewers were keen to hit out at Mark's controversial claims and took to Twitter to share their bemusement.

One wrote: 'This guy is deluded. Why waste your time with him? Forget images from space. I am ex royal navy and have seen the curvature of the earth from ground level at sea. How would he explain that?'

Another said: 'So bloody funny. He's so convinced the earth is flat. Why would they lie about it being round?'

771,"Lecture 13: The Harmony of the Spheres :

 Greek Astronomy
• Daily motion around the celestial poles (rising and setting).
• Eastward motion along the Ecliptic over a year
• The seasons are of unequal length - the Sun moves a little faster in winter, slower in summer.
• Eastward motion near the Ecliptic over a month.
• Generally eastward motion near the Ecliptic at different speeds for each planet.

Any successful description of the Solar System must explain all these facts.

Among the first Greek philosophers to suggest a geocentric system:
• Earth was a flat disk (cylinder) fixed and unmoving at the center.
• Sun, Moon & Stars were affixed to rotating crystalline spheres centered on the Earth.

Philosopher & Mathematician, founded the Pythagorean school. Taught that spheres are the perfect geometric shapes.

Vibrations from their rubbing together created a harmonious ""Music of the Spheres.""
• 3 each for the Sun and Moon
• 4 each for the 5 planets

Four Spheres for each planet:
• One was aligned with the celestial poles, turning once a day to give rising & setting.
• Second was tilted 23.5°, rotated slowly in the opposite direction to give the usual west-to-east drift of the planets relative to the fixed stars.
• Third & Fourth were introduced to produce the periodic retrograde motions of the planets.
• Earth fixed and unmoving at the center as it was too big to move, including rotation.
• All spheres were in uniform circular motion.
• The Earth was a sphere, fixed and unmoving at the center of the Universe.
• The natural state of motion on the Earth was rest.
• The natural state of the Heavens was unceasing uniform circular motion (or combinations of such motions).
• Built systems to conform to these ideals.
• No need to explain the physical ""causes"" of the motions.
• Puts the Sun, not the Earth, at the center.
• The Earth rotates and revolves around the Sun.
• Stars are on an outermost celestial sphere.
• Showed geometrically that the Sun was at least 20x further than the Moon.
• Really 400x further: sound method, but inadequate data.
• Meant Sun was 5x bigger than the Earth (more like 109x, again, sound method but inadequate data).
• Makes it even more absurd that the Sun should move, if the Earth was too large to move according to Aristotle.

We know none of the details of Aristarchus' Heliocentric model. We only have his treatise on the distances and sizes of the Moon and the Sun, from which we gather what his motivations might have been. We know of his Heliocentric model only from mention of it (usually dismissive) by others who came after him. Our primary surviving source is the of Archimedes.

The heliocentric picutre never caught on, perhaps because it was considered too radical given deeply ingrained notions about uniform circular motion and the immobility of the Earth.
• Discovered the Precession of the Equinoxes
• Introduced the Babylonian angular notation of 360° in a circle.
• Introduced epicycles, building on ideas of Apollonius of Perga.

The main circle is the Deferent, to which is afixed a second, smaller circle called the Epicycle (""on the circle"" in Greek), to which the planet is affixed. The two circles rotate counterclockwise at different rates fine-tuned to make the apparent motions as seen from the Earth come out right. Additional epicycles can be added to further fine-tune the system. Notice that the Earth is not exactly at the center of the Deferent, but slightly offset at the ""eccentric"" point.
• Superior planets are brighter at opposition, when moving retrograde.
• Placing the Earth at an eccentric away from the deferent center helps explain the observed non-uniform motions of the Sun, Moon, and Planets.
• Can fine-tune the model by adding epicycles

What distinguishes Hipparchus' geocentric model from all previous models is that it was firmly grounded in observational data, many observations of which he made himself (by all accounts Hipparchus was the supreme observational astronomer of the classical period). In many ways, this work marks a turning point between models motivated primarily by philosophical aesthetics and models based at least in part upon observational data. Hipparchus still sought to preserve appearances, and chose a reasonable (to him) geometric model to represent planetary motions mathematically.
• Compilation of all Mathematical & Astronomical knowledge of his time.
• Known to us in Arabic translations that hailed it ""Al Magest"" (""The Greatest"").
• Vastly influential work in medieval Europe after the 11th century.

Ptolemy introduced the Equant, a geometric device to account for observed changes in a planet's speed as it moved around the Earth.

• The Epicycle still moves about the center of the Deferent, but
• Uniform circular motion about the center of the deferent is replaced by uniform angular motion about an off-center equant point.
• Equants and eccentrics for all planets, the Moon, and Sun
• With only minor modifications, it provided accurate predictions of the motions of the planets, Sun, and Moon.

570,"I am sitting beside a lake in Northern California and the sky is an open blue canvas as far to the left and right of me as I can see; but it is smeared with graffiti and it is the wrong shade of blue, dull and pale. Just few years ago it would have been turquoise from where I am sitting and only cumulus clouds might have hung low, seeming almost tangible behind the ridges on the other side of the lake. The rest of that open dome would have been nothing but solid aqua-blue, a shade that is almost beyond description. I fell in love with that sky when we came here to live nearly ten years ago, deeply, crazy in love.

On February 14th, I sat in the front row at a conference on geoengineering at the 2015 AAAS meeting in San Jose, California. I watched a panel of scientists and one law professor each take his turn in a sort of performance that made no sense to me. On his way in, Alan Robock of Rutgers University went out of his way to say to a group of activists in front of the convention center, “I don't know what you're all protesting. It's nothing but water vapor.” This is the man who, in 2008, wrote “20 Reasons Why Geoengineering May Be a Bad Idea”. During the conference he made it a point to say that the reason those of us in Northern California notice these trails so much more than other people and think they are a problem is because our sky is so blue.

Dear Alan: Our sky was “so blue”. The trails you claim are nothing but water vapor are spreading out all over our sky and they're not only dimming the sun but are completely changing its color to a silvery blue.

What I'm struggling to understand is why people would go along with this. As I type, there are almost 20,000 signatures on a petition I wrote several months ago, and those people all see what isreally happening. Their comments are from the heart. They miss the sun. They miss their natural sky. Their children have breathing problems. For me, looking at this smeared mess over my head feels the same as when I am in a place of natural beauty and the rocks are sprayed with graffiti or there is trash on the ground. No matter what the words are or the wrapper that has been left behind, it says, “Disrespectful man was here.”

Who would invent a concept like deliberately spraying pollution into the sky? What kind of mind conceives an idea this horrible and says to someone, “Hey, we could intentionally pollute the sky and make fake clouds so that we can go on polluting the atmosphere with greenhouse gases for as long as we want. We could even control the weather!” What kind of people sit around the table in the planning room, nod their heads and reply, “Say, that's a swell idea!”? Haven't these people ever gone hiking? Have they ever paddled a canoe? Are they people who don't know the silky feel of a baby's hair beneath their fingertips? Are they people who don't see the beauty in a child's smile when he crosses a finish line and can still breathe? Or is the feeling of a paycheck being pressed into their palms the only thing that makes their heart race a little faster, or pulls their smile a little broader?

It is a beautiful plan, really. First, we were all programmed to think that only those who join the clubs, play for the team, fight for our country, or drink with the frat are “normal”. Those of us who crouched in the woods, dug in the dirt, collected pine cones, insects and objects other than shells on the beach were the weirdos. Most human beings attend ceremonies, follow traditions, perform rituals, stand in line, and fail to question because that is what has been expected of us all our lives. The television writes our script for existence in the modern world. The newscasters tell us only what they're permitted to say, and we are programmed to blindly accept only that which is “officially” published by certain “credible” institutions or academic authors.

Enter the word that separates the crowd: “Chemtrails”. It is pulled out like a hand puppet to create social exclusion. It manufactures instant division: the Us Team and the Them Team of the world's skywatchers. The Us Team thinks what is being done to the sky is insanity. We are watching the trees die from chemicals and lack of full sunlight. Some of us are aware of the raspy laugh or hoarse-sounding cough that had its onset when the spraying started above us. For others, the health consequences have been worse.

The Them Team is a mystery to me. Were they forced to wear bow ties at private school somewhere, to stand in line just a little too quietly when they wanted to run around on the playground instead? When they were children, were they forced into submission by an overly stern parent? Or are they just plain insane? Who would do this to our planet or go along with doing it to the only Earth we have? Who would turn a blind eye to what is happening and instantly tack on the title “Chemtrailer” to every person who questions the blatant mess that is intentionally being created daily by jet aircraft? What kind of person would publish a children's book, a movie, a photograph, or a computer game that subtly sells this concept by incorporating it into the artwork? Who are these people, and how in the name of God did I end up on the same planet with them?

Several times a day, I go out and walk the circumference of my above-ground swimming pool, looking for bumble bees to save from drowning in the water. Most of the time I scoop them up with my bare hands because they seem to somehow know I'm there to help. I place them as gently as I can onto the lavender plants and hope they can hear the others and recover. If they are faltering, I tell them they must try harder and I nudge them to flutter their wings so they will dry sooner. They are a gift. They are something the Them Team would not understand. They were something I overlooked most of my life until they disappeared. In the spring of 2013, only a couple of weeks after I saw the first group of jets spray an aerosol haze above my house, the bumble bees vanished. Every other insect on our property soon disappeared as well. By August of that year, the pool was devoid of insects and the porch light glowed moth-free, a ghostly reminder of what was being destroyed. I knew it was the trails. But I am just a “chemtrailer”. What do I know?

The Them Team has used their social exclusion tactics to draw a line in the sand so they can go on about the business of lying or denying. I think it's some of both, and I think the people on that team have many different agendas. By pulling out the label and plastering it around, some of them get to stand on a tiny pedestal and do what I call The Academic Chuckle when they deem it appropriate. They get to publicly make fun of thousands of people who have eyes they trust and children they are concerned about. They get to destroy the world while pretending they're saving it, and hundreds of people are going right along with them by not having the scrotal fortitude to stand up to them and their ready-made label. (Politicians are included in this long list of cowards.)

Geoengineering is happening. The government is manipulating the weather. Very wealthy people and corrupt corporations have a tremendous amount to gain from pushing California into a drought. Giant pharmaceutical companies are making millions on people with depressed immune systems and asthma. Welcome to America, everyone. Land of the oblivious, home of the cowardly. This is why the Them Team is getting away with it. People want to be part of something. They don't want to face social exclusion. They don't want to be ridiculed. They don't want to hear the Academic Chuckle and be on the wrong side of it. But there was a time when most of the world thought the earth was flat and people who thought it was round were laughed at, a time when Galileo was punished for his views on heliocentrism. Rachel Carson was publicly ridiculed when she warned of the dangers of DDT. Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was scorned for his suggestion that doctors wash their hands in a sanitizing solution before delivering babies in order to prevent childbed fever; and Louis Pasteur's ideas were met with skepticism. What aspect of the human mind makes it so resistant to new concepts, so unable to rise to the challenge of facing existing problems? How hard is it to look up at the sky and see what is happening? How hard is it to see that the trees are dying?

If I cared what other people thought, I wouldn't be writing this. Oh, sure, we all do to an extent, but there are some of us who were just born to pour the poison Kool-Aid down the drain and say, “Not for me!” When I was four years old, I went to nursery school in a section of the First United Methodist Church, and I knew what was beyond the door in the baby room. It led into the rest of the building and ultimately to the church sanctuary. Every so often, my grandmother would drag me reluctantly to Sunday services and feed me pink mint candy to keep me quiet, so I remembered seeing the sanctuary with its silky blue cushions and looming stained-glass windows. I was determined to find my way to it. I convinced about four other kids to join the caper. We sneaked through the nursery room door and skipped through the dark warren of hallways until we came to the light, and we exploded with giggles in that lofty, enormous room. Without a congregation, it had a beautiful dreamlike quality and it never occurred to me that I was breaking a rule. I only knew that I was on adventure and we had reached our destination. The punishment turned out to be better than the crime itself, for we were sentenced to help prepare lunches in the deepest, darkest part of the church with Mrs. Brezina for a week straight. She was the kindest jailer imaginable and her kitchen was tucked into a forgotten grotto that was as interesting as it was neglected.

Those of us who recruit others to sneak off to find a beautiful place that resides in our memory are the kinds of people who don't join clubs. We follow only rules that matter and we step out of line. Out of curiosity we play with the water squirter in the dentist chair when nobody is looking. We think for ourselves. We became accustomed long ago to being called names because we've always been different, so as a tactic of psychological manipulation, calling us names doesn't really work. The Them Team can try as hard as it wants to. It's not going to back us down and make us think, “Good heavens, someone is disdainfully lumping us into a category so we'd better shut up and go on about the business of fitting in.” Did Rachel Carson try to fit in? Semmelweis? Galileo? No, they did what they thought was right despite extreme opposition by their peers. They might not have had happy endings, but they all played a significant role in exposing the truth.

There was brilliance in contorting the word “chemtrails” so that it immediately triggers an emotional response in certain people. It has bought the Them Team time. In just two syllables it creates an obstacle. For people who believe in the established order of things, still believe our government is working for the greater good, and don't like to buck the system, there is that word like a comfortable old jacket ready to be slipped on to protect them from the truth: “The chemtrail people must be wrong because they are associated with a detestable word that makes them sound nuts.” And then they pull the jacket around them a little tighter. It is a convenient way out. Score one for the Them Team. They just got more time to carry on with their nasty deeds.

Human behavior is baffling. When did people become so out of touch with the natural world that they can't look up at the sky and see that things are just not right? When did seemingly intelligent people lose their ability to use reason? Scientists are “proposing” the very thing we are witnessing, and yet people are letting themselves be manipulated by one simple two-syllable word so that they are completely unable to see the truth hiding in plain sight.

The reality is, if our planetary situation is so dire that spraying a layer of pollution into the atmosphere is our only hope, people need to know. And if spraying aerosols into the atmosphere is putting millions of dollars into the pockets of big businesses and allowing companies to keep polluting for the almighty dollar, people need to know. If our governments are manipulating the weather, whatever the reason, people need to know.

There is no Us Team and Them Team. We are all riding on a relatively small ship in a very big universe, and it's dangerously close to sinking and taking us with it. That human tendency to think there is a big fix, that we can pull out all the stops in the end and save the day, is just wrong. We can't. It's time for everyone to face what is happening because, at this point, the truth is our only hope.",conspiracy,C005d9,flat.earth
107,"Financial writer and book author John Rubino sees the world careening toward a debt reset at an increasing pace. Rubino explains, “The coming monetary reset and what that means for gold and what that means for the rest of the global financial system, you don’t need a war to bring that about because we are making enough financial mistakes that will get us there in no time flat now without geopolitical turmoil. If you add a big war in the Middle East into the equation, then anything can happen. A scenario right now that is very, very feasible is we start shooting in the Middle East and Russia and China is on the other side of this in one way or another. They help Iran, and we have our allies helping us, and we start using these next generation weapons that are breathtakingly powerful. Nobody has any idea what’s going to happen when we start throwing these things at each other. . . . Oil spikes to $100 – $150 per barrel, and that tips the already extremely fragile global financial system over the edge. So, we get the ‘Greater Depression’ or the monetary reset or a hyperinflation or whatever we get sooner rather than later. It’s a disaster for everybody when it happens that way.”

Rubino says the monetary masters “tried to fix the financial system but could not do it.” Rubino says, “If you think you are beyond the point of no return financially as an individual, you borrow as much money as you can, and then go bankrupt. . . . Governments in the world are starting to do that now or behaving that way. . . . There is nothing they can do to fix the system. In the U.S., they tried to fix the system and scale back and they found out that is impossible. The central bank in the U.S. cannot raise interest rates without the economy collapsing. . . . So, they basically gave up. . . . They are printing a lot of currency electronically and dumping it into the banking system. . . . The consequence for the currency is to make it less valuable year after year . . . then you get the crackup boom . . . where people just lose faith in the currency because they see the government is going to make it less valuable year after year. So, there is no point in holding that currency as savings. They spend it as fast as they get it.”

In closing, Rubino says, “We have entered a new stage which feels like one of the end stages of this process—when governments just give up and don’t even pretend to try and control their finances anymore. Well, we are there. That’s when it will be clear to everybody that is the case, and then your gold goes through the roof. The investment thesis ends with you loading up on precious metals and then riding the inflation and/or monetary reset that has to happen because of past mistakes. . . . The nightmare scenario is if we are already having a financial crisis and then we have a war with China and Russia, it’s unimaginable. I cannot factor that into a scenario for financial asset prices because it is too crazy.”

1111,"As this decade comes to an end, there have been quite a few moments that people have hoped and prayed had never happened. While these 'foot-in-mouth' moments have numbered in the hundreds and thousands in this decade itself, we've rounded up ten of the choicest moments, some of them quite embarrassing for those concerned. This list of ten moments includes not just personalities in India and across the world, but also certain events that have had a number of consequences for those involved.

Here is a list of this decade's most 'foot-in-mouth' moments, in descending order:

Flat-earthers are those who believe, simply, that the earth is not round, but flat. No matter the evidence given, flat-earthers do not recognise the earth to be an oblate-spheroid, to use the terminology scientists have given to the planet's shape. This movement has been around for a long time, but has grown in popularity with the rise of social media and conspiracy theories. The movement has also attracted a few celebrities to ridicule or support the movement. In 2017, a rapper from the US started a GoFundMe page to crowdfund satellites to prove the earth was flat.

9. Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan's goof-ups on 'Koffee With Karan'

Bollywood celebrities Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan probably wished they would have brushed up on their general knowledge before slipping up on filmmaker Karan Johar's show, 'Koffee With Karan'. On being asked who the President of the country was, Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan said 'Prithviraj Chavan' and 'Manmohan Singh' respectively. Both celebrities were massively trolled online for their answers and were the laughing stock of social media users for quite a long time.

8. Fyre Festival and the 'sad' but viral cheese sandwich

The Fyre Festival promised to be a modern-day Woodstock, with the festival's organisers doubling down on the lavish promise of a grand music festival on an exotic island filled with food, drinks, music, luxurious bungalows to stay in and famous supermodels. Rich people who could afford the extravagant price tag, upwards of $10,000, flocked to the island, located in the Bahamas, only to be greeted with torrential rain a day before the festival was to kick off, small tents with dirty mattresses and...two breads with a cheese slice, tomato slices and lettuce leaves for food. A photo of the 'sad' cheese sandwich went viral on social media and marked the beginning of the end of festival. After a user posted the photo of the cheese sandwich, news of the disaster that was the Fyre Festival broke out and went viral on social media.

One of the festival's organisers Billy McFarland, was convicted of fraud, while the other, famous rapper Ja Rule, distanced himself from the festival.

Global soft drink brand Pepsi hoped to capitalise on the anti-establishment fervour in 2017, with an advertisement featuring celebrity socialite Kendall Jenner cutting across protestors and offering a policeman a can of Pepsi. With the 'Black Lives Matter' protests that had sparked in the US, the ad provoked an outcry and was widely derided on social media. Bernice King, the daughter of civil rights activist Martin Luther King, wrote a scathing response to the ad on Twitter: ""If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi,"" with a picture of her father being pushed by a police officer.

Union Minister Piyush Goyal became the centre of attention on social media in September this year while commenting on the state of the economy. Mr Goyal, while defending the government's handling of the economy, said ""If you're looking at a five trillion dollar economy, the country will have to grow at 12%. Today it's growing at 6%. Don't get into those maths. Those maths have never helped Einstein discover gravity... If you'd only gone by structured formulae and what was past knowledge, I don't think there would have been any innovation in this world"". Social media was quick to point out that it was Isaac Newton and not Albert Einstein who discovered gravity. After being derided for the remarks on social media, the minister said that some ""sought to remove the context, pick up one line and create a very mischievous narrative.""

'Alternative facts' was a phrase famously coined by US President Donald Trump's then White House advisor Kellyanne Conway. The phrase was coined after Trump's former White House press secretary Sean Spicer's alleged false statement on the number of people who had attended Trump's inauguration ceremony. Conway used the term to justify Spicer's claim that a large number of people had attended the ceremony, whereas photographic evidence proved otherwise.

Donald Trump has been notorious for his comments on climate change, including his recent barbs aimed at climate change activist, 16-year-old Greta Thunberg. ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,"" Trump had tweeted in 2012. In another tweet, Trump said that global warming was needed because it was freezing and snowing in New York.

Elon Musk stoked controversy last year, when the incident involving several children being trapped inside a cave in Thailand made headlines the world over, saw the tech billionaire play a role in rescue attempts as well. Following a disagreement with Vernon Unsworth, a British diver involved in rescuing the children, Elon Musk in a tweet, called him a ""pedo guy"". Unsworth had described Musk's proposal to build a mini-submarine to rescue the children as a ""PR stunt"". The comment has proved to be costly for Musk, with an ensuing lawsuit as well as several clarifications issued by him. As recently as this month, Musk's attorney Alex Spiro said ""pedo guy"" meant ""creepy old guy"" in South Africa, in a bid at damage control.

Former Junior Education Minister Satyapal Singh had last year claimed that the theory of evolution put forth by naturalist Charles Darwin was ""scientifically wrong"". ""Ever since humans came to Earth, they have always been humans,"" he had said, adding that ""Nobody, including our ancestors, have said or written that they ever saw an ape turning into a human being. No book we have read or the tales told to us by our grandparents had any such mention"". The comments provoked a sharp reaction from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in a harsh rebuke to his partymen, had said that ""we make mistakes and give 'masala' to the media... as if we are great social scientists and experts to analyse issues... the moment you see a camera you start speaking. So this half-baked stuff is picked up"".

The Indian Army in April this year, tweeted that it had spotted ""mysterious footprints of the mythical beast Yeti"", also known as the 'abominable snowman'. The army shared photos on Twitter claiming that a mountaineering expedition team had found the Yeti's ""mysterious footprints measuring 32X15 inches"".

In the images, the prints appear to be of a single foot. Scientists soon called for more credible proof before citing claims over the mythical beast, with one scientist telling NDTV that the finding by the army be ""best left as amateur speculation that needs to be debated further"". Social media didn't take too kindly over the army's claim either, with several users mocking it online. ""Couldn't you guys call a single animal expert before posting this?"" one person wrote, with another asking if it was a ""prank"". Yet another user mocked the image of the single footprint, saying that the beast ""travels by jumping.""",mainstream,M0d922,flat.earth
44,"A bet between two friends over whether the Earth is round or flat ended with one being charged with threatening to kill the other with a crossbow.

Louie Franz and Jamie Mathew Sutherland were having dinner in the New Zealand town of Queenstown and arguing about the planet’s true shape when they made a $10,000 NZD (£5,000) wager about who was right.

Mr Franz – a believer in the widely discredited flat Earth conspiracy theory – said they shook hands on the bet about whether the world was flat before Mr Sutherland – a believer in science – immediately demanded payment.

The dispute was eventually argued out in court after Mr Sutherland was charged by police for threatening to shoot his friend and his friend’s father at a petrol station, according to the Otago Daily Times.

The flat Earth believer told the Queenstown District Court judge: “[He said] ‘If you don’t pay it I’ll get a crossbow, I’ll shoot you and your father, put you in the trunk and they’ll never see you again’.”

The strange case began two months prior to the alleged threat made in February. After arguing about the Earth, Mr Franz told his friend: “I will bet you $10,000 [NZD] it’s flat.”

“Mr Sutherland quickly jumped on that bet – we shook hands and then he said, ‘You owe me $10,000’.”

Mr Franz told judge Bernadette Farnan: “It was kind of a joke for me – it was more of a ‘I bet you $10,000 because I’m so sure I’m right’.”

When the pair met again at a petrol station on 14 February, Mr Sutherland again demanded money, and was in no mood to joke about it.

“When someone threatens to kill you with a crossbow it’s quite concerning,” said Mr Franz.

Mr Sutherland’s defence lawyer reportedly said Mr Lanz had been “adamant” in his belief the Earth was flat, but later changed his mind on the issue.

Judge Farnan – following a brief “restorative justice” meeting in which the men agreed to end their dispute – decided there was no case to answer and dismissed the charge.

Mr Sutherland apologised to Mr Franz. According to the Otago Daily Times, he also agreed not to continue to insist the bet was paid.",mainstream,M0f979,flat.earth
422,"I'm always amazed what simpletons some brainy folks are. Once we regular folks leave college for the real world, we realize college graduates with numerous awards and diplomas are only smarter by degrees but not necessarily wiser. And common sense is not all that common. And Men of Letters often have no practical experience--aside from reading letters from other men like themselves. The average farmer working his field must calculate the gallons per hour his diesel tractor consumes. Applied science rather than theoretical science. If he tills a square mile of land, 640 acres, he realizes his tractor engine consumes more fuel at a higher RPM and the engine works harder but nor more efficiently, and so he sets his speed according. Applied science again when the farmer applies it in the field. Recently, some British poll determined a linguistic professor at MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology - was the smartest intellectual in the world. Allegedly the guy has written a couple hundred books. This fellow was so deep, one of the ""most cited"" authorities in the world, that whatever he said entered the realm of fact. Funny how an institution - Yale or MIT - can build a reputation for braininess but closer inspection indicates that lofty reputation is wholly undeserved. The average farmer tilling his land appears smarter by comparison. He applies his knowledge in the field, rather than simply positing theories that hold little merit when examined closely. Now MIT, like Yale University, is a huge, government funded and privately supported, think tank. Sort of like the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) or AIPAC, a couple of institutes that allegedly foster friendly foreign relations but which any objective observer would be hard pressed to explain just how they benefit the average American taxpayer. Likewise, Yale University: College of Criminal Arts, ranks among the most prestigious universities for brainy people but when you consider the yokels and hucksters and scalawags who have matriculated there""both Bush and Clinton clans as well as that doofus Kerry--any objective observer might deduce Yale's reputation for braininess was wholly undeserved. Awhile back, a number of MIT brains, including that institute's top ""intellectual"" deduced that 911 was simply what the government claimed it was: An act of terrorism wholly perpetrated by fanatics from the Middle East. Indeed, that top intellectual authored a book of his brainy interviews on the subject entitled ""9-11."" A hasty little compilation, the booklet hardly mentioned any of details of the attack. Instead, ignoring basic Core Evidence, ""9-11"" blamed American policies for the attack, but without mentioning the more intellectually challenging possibility: The attack was wholly or partially the brainchild of ""intellectuals"" much closer to home. Immediately after 911, a number of structural engineers gathered at the government-funded institute of MIT and - surprise, surprise - affirmed the government version of events about 911. ""The main culprits in bringing the famously lofty buildings down, they concluded, were the two intensely hot infernos,"" summarized Scientific American writer, Steve Ashley. ""The World Trade Center was never designed for the massive explosions nor the intense jet fuel fires that came next - a key design omission,"" according to Eduardo Kausel, M.I.T. professor of civil and environmental engineering and panel member. The towers collapsed, allegedly, after the kerosene jet fuel fire weakened high tensile steel. These ""scientific"" conclusions then appeared in the Scientific American magazine: Science & Technology at Scientific American, ""When the Twin Towers Fell"". Unfortunately, little of the structural steel in the WTC was examined, however, by the learned structural engineers. Beams and girders were instead shipped overseas for hasty recycling. Nor did any structural engineer comment on actual photos of the alleged ""inferno."" Might have been difficult for them to explain how a woman Walked Through Steel-Melting Fire. Now this MIT symposium, reminded me of a meeting of the Flat-Earth society, where believers hoisted their yardsticks above their heads and proclaimed they,d measured the surrounding countryside inch-by-inch and found it flat, thus the Earth was flat. The MIT structural engineers concluded their scientific symposium almost by a show of hands, or popular vote! ""Given the lack of firm conclusions regarding how the collapses occurred, (since all the evidence was conveniently destroyed) the M.I.T. panel participants asked their audience to consider various theories they put forth."" In short, they admitted, after expending hours of hot air, that they didn,t know what-the-hell happened! So instead of applying hard science, they applied theory. Since their government had hastily carted off all the factual, hard evidence that might have conflicted with ""scientific"" theory, they drew conclusions based on conjecture! So, instead of building a forty-foot, scale model (1/25 scale) of the boxy skyscrapers,WTC-1, WTC-2. WTC-7, and shooting an aluminum scale model airplane into the upper floors of building 1 & 2 at 400 miles per hour, and setting fire to that section with a few gallons (more or less) of kerosene, they simply dissected the blueprints, inspected some computerized images of floor joints, hypothesized that ""intensely hot infernos"" caused joist connections to fail, and delivered their conclusions to the modern Flat Earth society at MIT via the pages of the Scientific American. Morons In Training. Any metallurgist from a community college, with a modicum of field research and a curiosity about how things work, could construct a ten foot (1/100 scale) model of the WTC-7, set a few smoldering fires in the lower floors and film the results. And absolutely nothing would happen! Not today, not tomorrow and not next year. Instead, that scale model of a 47-story, steel skyscraper, (WTC-7), that allegedly collapsed due to the ""stress of intense heat"" would remain as inflexible as the gray matter in the brains of those MIT scientists. Unfortunately, our Morons In Training at MIT, which is only another government-funded think tank, feel no need to conduct honest, real world tests, since they do not live in the real world. They live in a world of illusions and government-funded, computer-generated propaganda. Pathetic. Philosopher and skeptic, Douglas Herman authored the definitive philosophical-suspense novel, The Guns of Dallas and writes for Rense. WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME? Which is the standard call of all college students these days. Let's begin with the first question, ""So What?"" So what is the big deal here? Is this something which is new? College students, even the brains, have no experience. This is true of all college grads, Ph.D., MBA, M.O.U.S.E., Physics, whatever. It's the experience which makes them know everything. It's the experience which comes after exposure to the reality of practicing their trade, using their degree. A college degree, no matter the size or shape, presents the basic knowledge base upon which a man or woman may learn from experience. Nothing new here. OK, OK, so I'll get to the point of others hanging on every word. Later. For the time being, let's discuss question number two. Who Cares? Not me. You see, I've had to deal with many a degreed primadonna during my career. When I consulted for a firm recently, there was a very brilliant MBA assigned by the firm's owners and board of directors, to my client. He was cocky, he was arrogant and he was almost always wrong. After a period of perhaps nine or so months, every decision I made, he countered. So, I resigned. The president of the firm called me back and told me I had full authority within the purview of my field, which was marketing. OK fine. The business more than doubled in less than two years. But did I make the ""kid"" as we called him, look bad? Hell no. I made the decisions, and I required that he, the kid, implement them. He learned. I learned. The owners learned. Everyone was happy. I met the kid in court about seven years ago. We were both paid expert witnesses. I went on first. I waited with bated breath for the kid to counter every darned thing I said. I was both surprised and happy to hear him agree with everything to which I testified. What's in it for me? Easy. That's the cry of the new college grad. When I graduated with a degree in EE and got my first job at Grumman in 1966, I was paid the then high salary of almost ten thousand dollars. Yikes. Today, the kids are paid minimum four times that if they're in the top ten percentile of their graduating class. Add a few more degrees and they will, with a Ph.D. in EE, pull down over a hundred thousand dollars in their first job. Can you imagine what they'll be earning when this country goes to hell in a hand basket? Give us six or seven years and these kids will be making up to three and a half yards a *week!* A yard being a thousand dollars. Now let us get back to the writer's main point. We give these kids credence. Well, that's quite so. But those who give these kids credence are *not* in the mainstream of practical application of the kids' expertise. They are likely in academia. Or they are in awe of those in academia. What's the point? Well, hell's bell's it's right theren staring you in the face if you just look. Ooops! You will require the services of a mirror. I almost forgot. Here, do this in remembrance of me ... Take a mirror, a hand mirror. Make like you are going to inspect your hair. You know, for fallout and stuff? OK. Now look right on top of that head of yours. What do you see? I know what I see. I see a point. See my point? Right there on the top of your head. Asked and answered, Your Honor.

906,"EVIL RISING: Disney now flat-out promoting demons and witchcraft to children

In accordance with its stated agenda of making the “demon realm feel like home,” The Disney Channel is releasing a new program for children called “The Owl House” that glorifies demons, witchcraft, and hell.

According to Disney, the series centers around a teenage girl named Luz who “discovers a portal to another realm where humans are not well-liked, and she must disguise herself in order to fit in at witch school.”

This realm, the kids programming empire says, is referred to as “Demon town,” and in it Luz decides to live with a demon named Eda the Owl Lady who’s “the most powerful witch on the Boiling Iles.”

Luz’s character decides during one of the earlier episodes of the show that, “Someday, I’m going to be just like her” – meaning Luz wants to grow up not to be an honorable human woman, but rather a demon witch like Eda.

The purpose of this storyline, of course, is to teach children whose parents let them watch The Disney Channel that being normal human beings is passé, and that it’s “cool” to discover portals that carry you off to hell to live with demons, witches, and even Satan himself.

“Folks, if you think this latest ‘Owl House’ show is just ‘fantasy and fun’ think again,” reads a commentary written by Deborah Bunting for CBN (The Christian Broadcasting Network).

“The show tries to portray witchcraft as a positive tool to fight evil,” she goes on to explains. “That’s similar to what real-life witches have been promoting over the past few years as they’ve been putting hexes on President Trump and others in order to fight for their beliefs.”

If you let your children watch The Disney Channel, you’re paving their way straight to hell

Many parents are simply unaware of this filth being peddled by Disney and The Disney Channel because they assume that the network resembles the Disney programming of old, which on its surface was clean and wholesome. In truth, Disney is actively indoctrinating child viewers into Satanism, using cartoon imaging as the lure.

“Over the years, Disney has gone farther and farther into the darkness of the spiritual world that opposes the living God, coming up with programming and characters that lead the vulnerable into that dark world of deception,” Bunting further warns. “This spiritual realm that opposes God is real. Demons are real.”

“And they are out to deceive your children and draw them in to be pawns of the enemy of their souls, the Devil, otherwise known as Satan,” she adds. “His devices and plans are to destroy your kids and grandkids spiritually, physically and emotionally. You must protect them from being enticed into this demonic world.”

Adam Hirsh, one of the voice actors on The Owl House, reportedly told Newsweek during a recent interview that the original pitch for the show was “girl hangs out with witch in hell.” Since most parents probably wouldn’t go for this, however, the network had to get creative.

It’s a lot like the Harry Potter book series, which is geared towards children with fun adventures, colorful storylines, and tailored writing specifically for little ears. But behind this thin façade is a world of darkness and depravity that sucks children in and consumes their souls.

“As ridiculous as the ‘demons’ contained in the book may be, there is nothing innocent or fun about even pretending to summon evil spirits,” says Elizabeth Johnston, also known as “Activist Mommy” on her blog.

“But who is to say it is pretend? The spirit world is real and is no laughing matter.”

A notable exorcist also told LifeSiteNews that this new Disney show is “a sign of the degeneration of our society,” which is pushing to make demons “acceptable” while ignoring “their malice and desire to do us harm.”

1234,"Short cuts bring the globe to your screen without crashing your computer.

The globe-imaging software Google Earth has become a cult web product since its release last June. Using the web-based tool, users can fly around the globe and zoom in on both natural features and whole worlds of information added by other users (see <?xm-replace_text ?>'The web-wide world').

But how is it possible for you to zoom in from outer space to a point somewhere above the rooftop of your house without bringing your desktop computer to a grinding halt?

The main obstacle to a convincing three-diménsional skydive is data transfer. If one were to download over the Internet a one-metre resolution image of the entire world it would take 69 years with a 10-megabit-per-second Internet connection, and 12,400 years with a standard 56K modem.

To slash the amount of data they have to transmit across the Internet, virtual globes such as Google Earth approximate the sphere of the planet's surface with a polygon made up of flat tiles. The further away your viewpoint is from the surface, the fewer tiles are needed to create the illusion of roundness, and the lower the resolution of these tiles can be.

As you zoom in, the computer explodes each tile into smaller sub-tiles, each with higher resolution, and re-forms the polygon into a ball. The process continues as you zoom. This means that the virtual globe only has to download high-resolution data when the viewer is actively zooming towards it.

Virtual globes also use another trick to speed<?xm-replace_text ?>things up further: a disk cache. Images for places you have already looked at are stored locally on your hard drive, so when you fly over this area again the software does not need to re-download the images, but instead quickly calls them up from your hard disk.

Google Earth was designed by Keyhole, a software company that Google bought in 2004. Many of the tricks it uses aren't unique: the tiling idea has been used by climate modellers, for example. But with good software and the speed of Google's enormous supercomputing platform, the results are impressive.

""I think Keyhole did a very good job,"" says Michael Goodchild, a geographer at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ""There are some elegant design decisions in there.""

700,"Your company’s best growth opportunities may be hidden by the big picture. To find those opportunities, look at markets and performance under a microscope. For example, a large industrial company suffered stagnant growth until a highly granular market analysis identified 4,000 growth pockets with $10 billion in revenue potential.
• Identify micro-segments of customers, geographic regions, and products where performance is increasing.
• Invest resources (R&D, advertising mix) in areas with the strongest growth momentum, and jettison low-growth areas.
• Restructure your organization to focus on the expanded number of growth priorities. For example, assign each micro-segment its own accountable leader. Some companies will need an executive team of 200 or more to lead new product clusters or geographic slivers.

A closer look at how to grow your business through a more granular approach:

Plot each of your company’s $50–$200 million growth opportunities (“pockets”) on a two-dimensional graph—a “heat map.” The y-axis represents market growth; the x-axis, market share compared with competitors’. Use circles to represent each pocket, and color code them to indicate in which of your company’s divisions or units the opportunity lies; size the circles to show the relative value of the business your company currently does in each pocket.

Once you’ve used your heat map to gain a more detailed view of your business, start managing your business in a more granular way:

Invest the lion’s share of your resources in the areas with strong market share and growth. Draw on insights about where growth pockets will be, not where they are now (for instance, GE announced that by 2010, it would be investing $1.5 billion annually in renewable-energy businesses.)

Beef up your M&A capabilities so you can quickly move into a high-growth market space through a targeted acquisition. Jettison low-growth businesses in unattractive market spaces.

Companies’ usual inner circle (CEO, unit heads, sales and functional leaders) isn’t large enough to make all the where-to-compete choices that arise every day. So devolve responsibility for the pursuit of fine-grained opportunities to your 200-plus top leaders.

These individuals might lead product clusters, geographic slivers, or special initiatives. They’ll focus your organization on important growth opportunities, while inspiring and motivating relatively small teams who’ll develop a strong sense of ownership.

But to manage the resulting complexity, ensure members of your extended leadership team fully understand how their individual goals fit with the company’s strategic priorities. Make certain they’re well versed in granular measurement approaches, such as the market heat map.

During regular operations reviews, push the conversation beyond high-level financial and operating numbers for a business’s multiple product lines and markets. Dig down into the underlying drivers of growth and profitability in the different component businesses. Ask questions such as:
• How is each growth driver changing?
• How likely is each component business to win in its market?
• Do resources need to be reallocated?

The title was a play on his 2004 documentary “Fahrenheit 9/11” that sought to expose mishandlings in President George W. Bush’s White House following the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The latest film, as Fox News previously reported, sought to do the same to President Trump at a key time for the country: the 2018 midterm elections.

“Fahrenheit 11/9” took in $3.1 million in 1,719 cinemas — a large debut for most documentaries but a fraction of the $23.9 million opening of “Fahrenheit 9/11.” That film went on to make $222.4 million worldwide, a record for documentaries.

Moore’s new film, which examines the rise of Trump and other developments like the water crisis in his hometown of Flint, Mich., had been predicted to open with $5 million to $8 million, but didn't even come close. This, despite a surge in success for documentaries at the box office in the past few months, including “RBG,” ‘‘Won’t You Be My Neighbor” and “Three Identical Strangers.”

“Fahrenheit 11/9,” the first release from former Open Road chief executive Tom Ortenberg’s new distributor, Briarcliff Entertainment, may have decent weeks ahead leading up to the November elections. ComScore’s PostTrak survey found that 82 percent of viewers gave it four out of five stars. It landed an “A” CinemaScore.

“Those who did see it really enjoyed it,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore. “People have said: Should they have gone limited? Should they have gone wide? I think they needed to get it out there nationwide with midterms six weeks away. But it’s very easy to second-guess how to release a documentary like this. It’s one of the most difficult types of films to release.”

Last month, Moore, whose 2002 documentary “Bowling for Columbine” won an Oscar, made headlines when the trailer for “Fahrenheit 11/9” referred to Trump as “the last president of the United States.” The anti-Trump filmmaker sat down with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, who asked Moore about the bold claim.

“I think it’s possible, absolutely. I think that we have someone in the White House who has no respect for the rule of law, who dislikes democracy by an incredible degree, which doesn’t make him really any that much different from other billionaires or CEOs because their businesses are not democracies,” Moore responded.

Moore said people like Trump “rule by fiat” and don’t like when other people have a voice in their decision-making.

“They also like to take home the bulk of the money with them. So this is — putting somebody like that in charge of a democracy is a very dangerous thing, and especially, it’s more dangerous with him because he has a complete lack of ideology,” Moore told Hayes.

The gothic family fantasy “The House With a Clock in Its Walls” exceeded expectations to debut with an estimated $26.9 million in ticket sales at the weekend box office. It was easily the biggest draw on a quiet weekend at North American movie theaters, where the other new wide releases all disappointed or downright flopped.

Dan Fogelman’s “Life Itself” and the home invasion thriller “Assassination Nation” both barely made a blip in nationwide release. Though Fogelman’s “This Is Us” is one of TV’s top-rated series, his “Life Itself” bombed with $2.1 million despite a starry cast including Olivia Wilde, Oscar Isaac and Antonio Banderas.

113,"An asymptotic theory is presented for calculating co-seismic potential and geoid changes, as an approximation of the dislocation theory for a spherical Earth. This theory is given by a closed-form mathematical expression, so that it is mathematically simple and can be applied easily. Moreover, since the asymptotic theory includes sphericity and vertical structure effects, it is physically more reasonable than the flat-Earth theory. A comparison between results calculated by three dislocation theories (the flat-Earth theory, the theory for a spherical Earth and its asymptotic solution) shows that the true co-seismic geoid changes are approximated better by the asymptotic results than by those of a flat Earth. Numerical results indicate that the sphericity effect is obvious large, especially for a tensile source on a vertical fault plane.",mainstream,M14c93,flat.earth
594,"Having said that, as you continue to broaden the application of something like that, it’s quite a blunt hammer. And so it does come with trade-offs. For example, how do you define something authoritative across the broad swath of YouTube when many of the use cases, as you know, are outside of the information-seeking realm? They’re entertainment, they’re oftentimes driven by people’s personal tastes, like music and comedy and the like.

Right, but you could do it just for politics, hypothetically, and say that for any political video, we’re going to move to this “authoritative sources” model.

I think that even when you go to something that broad, it comes with real trade-offs. And I’m just raising the fact that there are considerations there, which is that you are then limiting political discourse to a set of preordained voices and outlets and publications. And I think that especially when it comes to something as charged and societally impactful as politics, there needs to be room for new voices to be heard.

Since the New Zealand shooting, we’ve heard this question about “Well, the platforms worked together to take down ISIS content. Why haven’t they done the same for white supremacy or violent right-wing extremism?” What’s the answer there?

The first thing that I would say, just as a matter of fact, is that there were two sets of challenges when it came to the New Zealand shooting. One was everything that we just talked about in terms of surfacing authoritative, high-quality information — not showing, you know, conspiracies or harmful misinformation. That was one bucket.

The other bucket had to do with the velocity at which re-uploads were coming to these various platforms, and that is an area where we collaborated. We worked closely with other platforms in terms of making sure we had fingerprints of these videos, just like they did, and we shared those.

The other thing I would say, just more generally, in the case of violent extremism and limiting those videos on the platform, the reason it’s different than what we’re talking about here is that those [ISIS] videos took on a particular form. They were often designed for propaganda purposes and recruitment purposes. So they had things like branding and logos, both visually and in terms of the music they might use. Those formed a set of finite clues we could use to bring that content down. And, of course, we collaborated with other platforms to do that.",mainstream,M0e895,flat.earth
861,"For decades, U.S. companies have been outsourcing manufacturing in the belief that it held no competitive advantage. That’s been a disaster, maintain Harvard professors Pisano and Shih, because today’s low-value manufacturing operations hold the seeds of tomorrow’s innovative new products.

What those companies have been ceding is the country’s industrial commons—that is, the collective operational capabilities that underpin new product and process development in the U.S. industrial sector. As a result, America has lost not only the ability to develop and manufacture high-tech products like televisions, memory chips, and laptops but also the expertise to produce emerging hot products like the Kindle e-reader, high-end servers, solar panels, and the batteries that will power the next generation of automobiles.

To rebuild the commons and restore its wealth-generating machine will require government and industry in the United States to make two drastic changes:
• The government must change the way it supports basic and applied scientific research to promote the broad collaboration with business and academia needed to tackle society’s big problems.
• Corporate management practices and governance structures must be overhauled so they no longer exaggerate the payoffs and discount the dangers of outsourcing production and cutting investments in R&D.

843,"THE transmitting aerial of a broadcasting station designed for local or national service should confine as much as possible of its radiated energy to the horizontal direction, emitting as little as possible in directions making an angle of less than 60 ° with the vertical. The station will then have a large service area in which little fading is experienced. The demand for information on the design of such an aerial has given rise in recent years to some theoretical and experimental investigations on the general properties of antennas used in radio transmitting stations. A new and useful contribution to the state of knowledge on this subject has recently been given by Prof. P. O. Pcdersen in a booklet published (in English) in Copenhagen (“Radiation from a Vertical Antenna over Flat Perfectly Conducting Earth.” Pp. 49 + 35 figures. G. E. C. Gad: Vimmelskaftet 32, Copenhagen. Kr. 6.00). This work comprises a theoretical investigation of the radiation characteristics of a vertical antenna over Hat perfectly conducting earth, having for its objective a determination of the most suitable dimensions of the antenna at the new Copenhagen broadcasting station. The theoretical results have been checked by measurements of the distribution of the current in the antenna and of the field intensity at various distances from the station. To facilitate the theoretical analysis, the current distribution in the transmitting antenna is in the first case assumed to be sinusoidal, although it was known that this is not valid in the practical case. The complete general formulas for the radiated field for an antenna are obtained, and a most useful series of tables and graphs are provided, from which the radiation resistance and the distribution of the radiated field in the vertical plane may be calculated for antenna; of various dimensions.",mainstream,M0a55e,flat.earth
979,"The world of science is undoubtedly becoming more mysterious by the day. This is exemplified by multiple discoveries within the realms of quantum physics, parapsychology, and more — discoveries that have challenged (and continue to challenge) the current framework of accepted scientific knowledge. This kind of shift in ideology has happened many times over the course of our history; when the world instantaneously became round from flat, the majority of people were in disbelief and labelled the new theory’s proponents as blasphemers.

Some great examples of science that challenge these current and long held belief systems include: quantum entanglement, studies which examine the role of consciousness on physical systems (like the quantum double slit experiment), placebo studies, distant healing, and more.

Another great example is teleportation, as several interesting findings within this field seem to be (at least partly) turning science fiction into science fact.

The title asserts that he teleported DNA. It seems, as with other “fringe” topics when it comes to science, phenomena like this receives harsh criticism and resistance from a still decent sized part of science. That being said, did he really teleport DNA? Given his reputation and credibility, combined with all of the studies done in various types of teleportation, the black budget and more, I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Nobel Prize winning scientist Luc Montagnier, previously known for his work on HIV and AIDS, claims to have demonstrated that DNA can be generated from its teleported “quantum imprint.” This is a discovery that, were the scientific community to get on board, would represent “the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 years, demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry,” (source) according to theoretical chemist Jeff Reimers of the University of Sydney, Australia.

In the experiment, two adjacent but physically separate test tubes were placed within a copper coil and subjected to a very low frequency electromagnetic field of 7 hertz. The apparatus was isolated from Earth’s natural magnetic field so there was no interference. One tube contained a fragment of DNA (approximately 100 bases long) and the second one contained nothing but water. (source) (source) (source) (source)

After approximately 17 hours, the gene fragment (according to Montagnier) was recovered from both tubes, even though one should have just contained water.

Although Montagnier’s claims have received harsh criticism from various scientists, there was a general consensus that his results should be investigated further. For example, Giuseppe Vitiello, of the University of Salemo in Italy, is confident that the experiment is reliable.

Greg Scholes, from the University of Toronto, Canada, who last year demonstrated that quantum effects occur in plants, said that “the biological experiments do seem intriguing, and I wouldn’t dismiss them.” (source)

Today, numerous teleportation breakthroughs have been made. One example comes from the work of Professor Rainer Blatt at the University of Innsbruck. He and his colleagues were successfully able to perform teleportation on atoms for the first time. Their work was published in the journal Nature. (source)

Another study, published by a team of University of Queensland physicists in the journal Nature in 2013, demonstrated successful teleportation with solid state systems. (source) This is a process by which quantum information can be transmitted from one place to another without sending a physical carrier of information. This is made possible through the phenomenon of entanglement.

A team from the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI) at the University of Maryland (UMD) and the University of Michigan has succeeded in teleporting a quantum state directly from one atom to another over a substantial distance. (source)

There are different categories of teleportation. Another types of teleportation apart from quantum is psychic, which is the conveyance of persons or inanimate objects by psychic means.

“It became known to myself, along with several colleagues both inside and outside of government, that anomalous teleportation has been scientifically investigated and separately documented by the Department of Defense.” (source) – Eric Davis, Ph.D, FBIS

A paper published in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in September 1981, in the journal Ziran Zazhi (Nature Journal), reported that “gifted children” were able to cause the teleportation of small, physical objects from one place to another. Objects included watches, horseflies, other insects, radio micro-transmitters, photosensitive paper and more. The paper, titled “Some Experiments on the Transfer of Objects Performed by Unusual Abilities of the Human Body” (Shuhuang et al., 1981), reveals that participants never touched the objects beforehand. The experiments were done under both blind and double-blind conditions, and the researchers involved came from various colleges and sectors of the Department of Defense.

Furthermore, scientists have conducted studies on people in the lab which produced remarkable results, observing people describe physical objects that had been hidden in a remote location. (source)

The list of strange things reported in the world of science is never ending, and I believe the ‘politicization’ of academia and publications, as well as the ‘black budget‘ world, are important things to think about when it comes to the world of science, what research gets published, and what our minds are willing to explore – regardless of how hard it might be to accept.",conspiracy,C0170c,aids; flat.earth
1151,"Chairman of GATA (Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee) Bill Murphy thinks financial markets are way more vulnerable than they appear. Murphy explains, “There are negative interest rates and low interest rates that just keep staying down there, and supposedly things are really good. Look at our Dow at all-time highs, and yet something is really wrong. Of course, this fits into the GATA premise on this whole thing. There’s a lot of quantitative easing (money printing) and propping up of the markets, and it’s on very shaky ground. The plug could be pulled at any time. . . . With interest rates where they are and debt growing all over the place, the reasons to be in gold are off the charts.”

Murphy says “silver is Kryptonite to central bankers” because there is little supply to use in the cartel’s suppression game. Murphy says, “You mention the word Kryptonite and the key is what silver is doing. It is an extraordinary situation right now. . . . It seems to me that, this year, silver is in play . . . . That is this big money talking on the JPMorgan crowd and their game. They are gradually moving in for what I think is going to be one of the biggest market moves in history, and that is silver going to $50 (per ounce) and then a $100 (per ounce). Basically, it’s because supply is drying up. . . . Where is all this supply coming from that this JPMorgan crowd has been feeding the market with, and I think they are hitting the wall with it. I think this big money knows what’s going on, and they are quietly moving in. That’s the reason silver has been trading like it has. $18.50 was a key number. That was the completion of a big base. . . . The next big key is to take out $20.50, but the real number is $21. If it gets above $21, it’s going to start trading chaotically with volatile action on the upside. The market move is going to be historic.”

Murphy has long charged there was suppression of gold and silver prices and has been proven 100% correct. He now charges, “The real key for this gold cartel, as we call it, is the suppression of the gold price. They realized a long time ago they couldn’t have a dichotomy between the silver and gold. So, they got involved in the silver market (to suppress the price) to make gold look like it should be doing what it is. The problem is they are running out of physical silver to keep the price down. . . . Eventually, you are going to get a commercial signal failure in silver, which means these so-called commercials, which is a misnomer because they are not commercials, they’re gold cartel trying to keep the silver price down. They know when they lose control of silver, and it gets to $21 (per ounce), it will be the end of their gold suppression scheme. . . . It will be a gradual process because the price of silver is going to go bonkers. It will show what they have been doing all these years. I think they are finally reaching a tipping point. . . . The death knell to the gold cartel is the lack of supply of silver to keep the price down. . . . I think you are going to see the double top of $50 be taken out and go to at least $100 per ounce and maybe a lot more. I think it’s going to move up faster than anybody can imagine. . . . Gold is going to move to some big number also. . . .If gold kept pace with inflation, it would be double what it is today.”

Here ""world picture"" means the conception of the visible universe, not including all kinds of mythical or religious representations of what was imagined to be ""under the earth."" This archaic world picture (and also its penetration by a curious head) is beautifully rendered in a picture that is often thought to belong to the Renaissance period but was actually drawn in 1888 A.D. on the instructions of the famous French astronomer and popularizer Camille Flammarion (Fig. 1.1). The drawing refers to a story about Archytas (428-347 B.C.), who is supposed to have asked whether it would be possible to put a hand or a stick out of the heavens (DK 47A24).

303,"A government-run study of Gilead’s remdesivir, perhaps the most closely watched experimental drug to treat the novel coronavirus, showed that the medicine is effective against Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.

In a statement on Wednesday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is conducting the study, said preliminary data show patients who received remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received placebo.

The finding — although difficult to fully characterize without full, detailed data for the study — would represent the first treatment shown to improve outcomes in patients infected with the virus that put the global economy in a standstill and killed at least 218,000 people worldwide.

During an appearance alongside President Trump in the Oval Office, Anthony Fauci, the director of NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health, said the data are a “very important proof of concept” and that there was reason for optimism. He cautioned the data were not a “knockout.” At the same time, the study achieved its primary goal, which was to improve the time to recovery, which was reduced by four days for patients on remdesivir.

The preliminary data showed that the time to recovery was 11 days on remdesivir compared to 15 days for placebo, a 31% decrease. The mortality rate for the remdesivir group was 8%, compared to 11.6% for the placebo group; that mortality difference was not statistically significant.

That is “the first convincing evidence that an antiviral drug can really benefit Covid-19 patients, specifically hospitalized Covid-19 patients,” said Frederick Hayden, a professor emeritus of clinical virology and medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. “This will change the standard of care in the United States and other countries for the patients who have been shown to be benefited,” he said, adding that determining the exact group that should receive the drug will require further examination of the data.

Over the past few weeks, there have been conflicting reports about the potential benefit of remdesivir, a drug that was previously tried in Ebola. As previously reported by STAT, an early peek at Gilead’s study in severe Covid-19 patients, based on data from a trial at a Chicago hospital, suggested patients were doing better than expected on remdesivir. Days later, a summary of results from a study in China showed that patients on the drug did not improve more than those in a control group.

Full results from the China study were also released Wednesday.

But the NIAID study, which was not expected to be released so soon, was by far the most important and rigorously designed test of remdesivir in Covid-19. The study compared remdesivir to placebo in 800 patients, with neither patients nor physicians knowing who got the drug instead of a placebo, meaning that unconscious biases will not affect the conclusions.



The main goal of the study is the time until patients improve, with different measures of improvement depending on how sick they were to begin with. While the result means that the drug helps patients improve faster, it is not possible to say how dramatic those improvements are.

Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said he expected there was enough evidence for the agency to issue an “emergency use authorization” for remdesivir.

“Remdesivir isn’t a home run but looks active and can be part of a toolbox of drugs and diagnostics that substantially lower our risk heading into the fall,” he said.



Aneesh Mehta, a physician at Emory University and an investigator in the NIAID study, said the results were “robust enough” to report preliminary findings, but a full analysis of all the data will be required to fully understand the drug’s effect. The time to recovery seen in the final analysis “could be shorter, it could be longer. We don’t know yet.” Mehta also expects the final results to do some analyses on which patients might benefit most from remdesivir.

The FDA previously issued an emergency authorization for the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, even though at least some studies suggested the medicine was not effective. “If hydroxychloroquine met [the emergency] standard, then remdesivir would have seemed to cross that line a while ago, especially in the setting of treating critically ill patients,” Gottlieb said.

Remdesivir, which must be given intravenously, is likely to remain a treatment for patients who are hospitalized. But it is also likely that it will be most effective in patients who have been infected more recently, said Nahid Bhadelia, medical director of the special pathogens unit at Boston Medical Center.

“We know that with most antiviral medications the earlier you give it the better it is.” said Bhadelia, who had experience giving remdesivir as an experimental treatment for Ebola in Africa, where results are less encouraging. That means that better diagnostic testing will be essential to identifying patients who could benefit. “What will be important is that we find people on the outpatient side,” Bhadelia said. “Again, testing becomes important, we want to have them come to the hospital as soon as possible.”



Although the data have not yet been released, it’s standard procedure for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to release market-moving information as soon as they have it, due to regulatory requirements.

Gilead on Wednesday did release data from its own study of remdesivir in patients with severe Covid-19. This study showed similar rates of clinical improvement in patients treated with a five-day and 10-day course of remdesivir, the company said.

“Unlike traditional drug development, we are attempting to evaluate an investigational agent alongside an evolving global pandemic. Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 and how to best utilize the drug,” said Merdad Parsey, Gilead’s chief medical officer, in a statement.

Gilead said that its own study in severe patients showed that it may be possible to treat patients with a five-day treatment of remdesivir, not the 10-day course that was used in the NIAID trial.

The company’s study is enrolling approximately 6,000 participants from 152 different clinical trial sites all over the world. The data disclosed Wednesday are from 397 patients, with a statistical comparison of patient improvement between the two remdesivir treatment arms — the five-day and 10-day treatment courses. Improvement was measured using a seven-point numerical scale that encompasses death (at worst) and discharge from hospital (best outcome), with various degrees of supplemental oxygen and intubation in between.

The study design means that by itself it doesn’t reveal much about how well remdesivir is working, because there is no group of patients who were untreated. The conclusion is that the two durations of treatment are basically the same.

Peter Bach, the director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Medical Center, said he is eager to see the data from the NIAID study but renewed his criticism of Gilead’s severe study for lacking a control group of untreated patients. That would have allowed researchers to make important conclusions about how the drug works that are just not possible now, he said.

“They’ve squandered an unbelievable opportunity,” Bach said. “It’s not going to tell us what to do with 80-year-olds with multiple comorbidities compared to 30-year-olds who are otherwise healthy. We’re still going to be foundering around in the dark, or at least in a dim room, when we could have learned more.”

In the study, the median time to clinical improvement was 10 days in the five-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of the patients in both groups were discharged from the hospital by day 14. At day 14, 64.5% of the patients in the five-day group and 53.8% of the patients in the 10-day group achieved clinical recovery.

Patients in the trial generally lived, though this may be because their illness was not that severe to begin with. For most of the study, patients already on ventilators were not enrolled.

Eight percent of the patients treated with five days of remdesivir died, compared to 11% of the patients treated for 10 days. Outside of Italy, where 77 patients were treated, the overall mortality rate across the entire study was 7%, Gilead said. Those mortality rates are lower than those seen in other studies, which have been in the teens and twenties.

Only 5% of patients in the five-day group and 10% in the 10-day group had side effects that led to a discontinuation. The most common bad effects — and it’s impossible to tell which were from the drug — were nausea and acute respiratory failure. High liver enzymes occurred in 7.3% of patients, with 3% of patients discontinuing the drug due to elevated liver tests.

A full evaluation of the results will have to wait until complete data are available.

In the China study, also published Wednesday in the Lancet, investigators found that remdesivir “did not significantly improve the time to clinical improvement, mortality, or time to clearance of virus in patients with serious COVID-19 compared with placebo.”

There was a 23% improvement in time to clinical improvement for remdesivir compared to placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant. At the median, remdesivir-treated patients improved in 20 days compared to 23 days for placebo patients. At one month, 14% of the remdesivir patients had died compared to 13% of the placebo-treated patients.

The China study enrolled patients with more severe Covid-19 than the study conducted by NIAID. The China study was also stopped early because of difficulties enrolling patients as the pandemic waned in China.

Hayden, the University of Virginia virologist, was one of the investigators in the China study and pointed to the similarity of the results. He said that while the NIAID investigators had been able to enroll enough patients, the decrease in cases in Wuhan due to the lockdown had made that impossible. “I was struck by the consistency,” he said.",mainstream,M0fb2c,flat.earth

But it does buy luxury in much of the rest of the world. In fact, you don't need nearly that much. There are plenty of destinations around the world where you can live like a millionaire for just a few thousand dollars a month. Forget about the billionaires with all those things that they never use. Start researching where the cost of living is low enough to live in relative splendor for far less than a million dollars.

This tiny Central American nation, home to the famous Panama Canal, has regularly garnered a top spot on the International Living Annual Global Retirement Index. Whether you relocate to the Caribbean or Pacific coast, no matter if you prefer a tropical or temperate climate, the affordable quality of life remains a consistent draw.

Panama City is the most sophisticated and expensive part of the country. However, it is still possible to live in world-class luxury for under $4,000 a month. Even $1,500 buys considerable comfort in Panama City. Mountain towns, such as Boquete, offer milder temperatures and a lower cost of living. If you find that you like living here, it is surprisingly cheap and easy to retire to Panama.

A good starting point to budget a Thai lifestyle is 65,000 Thai bahts or around $2,000 per month. That's what the Thai government demands of expatriates who seek a retirement visa. Even $3,500 won’t buy all-out luxury in Bangkok, where upmarket condos might require a budget closer to $5,000 per month. However, $2,000 will allow for a very comfortable lifestyle in smaller cities.

Look into lovely Chiang Mai, renowned for its historic temples, cuisine, and forested hills. Considering that most locals get by on less than $1,000 a month, $3,000 may feel like a princely sum. There are also many other fascinating places to retire in Thailand.

Spain deserves a spot on this list for one simple reason. It’s the only low-priced country that ranks in Numbeo's top ten for quality of life. Of course, you’ll need to steer clear of Madrid and Barcelona if you’re seeking a posh lifestyle for poquito dinero (not much money). Fortunately, many smaller cities and towns offer plenty of cultural, culinary, and recreational delights for a relatively modest price tag.

Granada offers a relaxed and affordable lifestyle. It is home to the Alhambra, a World Heritage Site that was a finalist in the contest to be one of the modern seven wonders of the world. A city center three-bedroom apartment rents for about $690, while a three-course meal for two at a midrange restaurant comes to only around $23. These prices are practically unheard of in the other countries that rank in the top ten for quality of life.

Seville is similarly low-priced and holds such wonders as the Alcazar Palace (Dorn on Game of Thrones) and the fabulous Roman ruins in Italica. It is even possible to retire in Spain with $200,000.

Don’t discount Mexico as merely a vacation spot. This fascinating country is much more than the Yucatan Peninsula, that string of gorgeous beaches with all the tourist trappings that gorgeous beaches bring. In fact, Mexico has been gaining popularity as a retirement spot due to reasons that transcend its miles of oceanfront. You can live in Mexico in relative luxury (think maid service, a gardener, and dinners out) on a budget of less than $2,500 a month.

Certain provinces of Mexico continue to be dangerous, but others are considered much safer.

At 122 square miles, Malta is a tiny bit of island paradise in the Mediterranean. Beautiful apartments in the capital city of Valletta rent for under $1,500 per month, so a $3,000 monthly budget stretches far here.

The Philippines has one of the lowest costs of living in the world, a warm climate, and many attractive destinations for expatriates. Here, it is possible to rent a large house with a private pool, a maid, and a chauffeur for what it would cost to rent a luxury apartment in some countries. Strong historical ties with the United States also helped make the Philippines friendly to English speakers. There are several well-developed parts of the country, such as Cebu City, that cater to retirees and other expatriates. However, it is essential to consider the pros and cons of retiring in the Philippines.

Most people think of overpriced Paris when they think of France, but those who know the country best have always known better. Louis XIV knew how to live, and he preferred living in Versailles. It is possible to live like an aristocrat, if not a king, for under $5,000 per month just outside Paris near Versailles. Parts of the Loire Valley, home to so many beautiful chateaus, are also surprisingly affordable.

France features a fabulous quality of life. The fantastic food, rich history, refined culture, beautiful landscapes, and livable cities have drawn travelers for centuries. You can live very well in many parts of France for less than $3,000 a month. Just avoid Paris.

There is so much to love about living in Portugal. The friendly people, romantic architecture, sunny beaches, port wine, and haunting fado music make for a unique experience. In Lisbon, Portugal’s most expensive city, a furnished two-bedroom flat in an upscale area can be found for around $1,000 a month. There are many alluring cities in Portugal for retirees. It should not be too hard to save enough money to retire in Portugal.

Adventure junkies hold Costa Rica—Spanish for “rich coast”—dear to their hearts. That’s because this compact country is bursting at the seams with waterfalls, rivers, lakes, and miles of pristine beaches. Also, don't forget the dramatic volcanoes and diverse wildlife. Why not extend a Costa Rican adventure into a year-round lifestyle?

Living in Costa Rica is even more affordable than vacationing there. In resort towns along the central coast, a typical two-bedroom condo near the beach can be rented for less than $1,000 per month. You might even want to buy a beach condo in Costa Rica. Another draw? Medical care is also excellent and inexpensive.

With bragging rights for the cheapest cost of living in Central America, Nicaragua gets its fair share of budget and adventure travelers. They are drawn to warm weather, vibrant cities, colonial architecture, and idyllic seaside villages. Sure, Nicaragua's history of civil war and revolutionary upheaval scares away some travelers. That also means fewer people have discovered how nice Nicaragua can be today, so prices remain low.

Granada is perched upon the picturesque north shore of Lake Nicaragua, with a volcano in view to add to the postcard-perfect scene. This city is home to many North American retirees in search of the good life. Monthly expenses for a comfortable lifestyle average around $1,000. Just imagine what you could do with three times that. Nicaragua is one of the best countries for retirement in Latin America.

109,"An ardent flat-earther has answered the age old question of: ‘Well, why don’t you fall off the edge of the Earth?’

It’s a pretty good one, so far as questions go in the world of Flat Earth conspiracies but Connor Murphy reckon he has the answer.

Connor, son of famous flat-earther Dave Murphy, spoke exclusively to UNILAD about NASA, the Sun, Photoshop and pretty much everything you’ve ever wanted to ask someone who thinks the reason you see the curvature of Earth from a plane is because the windows are round.

Speaking about why NASA and the government would lie about space travel, he said:

There are two good reasons in my opinion. One obvious reason would be money. The money raised by NASA alone since their inception is something like fifteen trillion dollars, and with that money they’ve really shown little for their work.

They’re releasing composite images and articles and telling you this is what’s happening, this is what we’re doing, and we spent seven hundred million dollars to get this photo of Pluto that we had to put together in Photoshop.

A second thing is to make people feel insignificant. It makes you feel like you’re an insignificant speck of dust and therefore you’re easy to control. Basically if you can imagine the globe squashed down with Antarctica instead of being its own continent, being the perimeter around the side. So a lot of people say that’s an ice wall. It’s more like a shelf or cliff.

There’s water above, there’s the firmament – or the dome – and there’s water above it and water below it and there’s no leaving it, there’s no finding other Suns and stuff. You can’t fall off the edge, essentially.

What about the curve of the Earth you can see when you fly? Conor said:

You cannot see curvature from a plane. The reason why it may seem is because of the way planes have to be designed. Every single window on a plane has to be round and curved because the cabin itself is curved.

You can’t have straight panes or they would explode and everyone with the plane would be done. Next time you’re on a plane, look out the window and at the wing, because the wing will seem to curve as well.

Connor believes the only reason a lot of find Flat Earth conspiracies a complete joke is because we’re taught to do so from a very early age.

He didn’t personally always believe the Earth was flat, but as he got older and delved into it he found there to be too many ‘inconsistencies with the model you’re taught at school’, he couldn’t ignore them anymore.

‘At one point,’ he finishes, ‘you have to make a decision on where you lie on it and I had to pick the Flat Earth.’",conspiracy,C0114d,flat.earth
115,"Self-taught rocket scientist “Mad Mike” Hughes plans to launch himself 1,800 feet (550 metres) and fly through the air at 500mph in his steam-powered vessel made of scrap metal. The 61-year-old limo driver has spent £15,000 ($20,000) building his rocket and his goal is to get 10 miles high so he can prove the Earth is disc-shaped. He also used protective Rust-Oleum paint and he bought a motor home on craigslist which he converted into a launch vessel. The flight is planned for this weekend and is the first step in his flat-Earth space programme.

Mr Hughes said: “I don't believe in science. It'll shut the door on this ball Earth.” He goes on to explain that NASA is controlled by round-Earth Freemasons and Elon Musk is making fake rockets. In the future, he plans to make a rocket that can take him to the outskirts of space so he can snap a picture and prove the world is flat. He added: “It's scary as hell, but none of us are getting out of this world alive.

""I like to do extraordinary things that no one else can do, and no one in the history of mankind has designed, built and launched himself in his own rocket. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air, about the certain size of rocket nozzles, and thrust. But that's not science, that's just a formula. “There's no difference between science and science fiction.” This is the second time he has constructed and launched a rocket.

He jumped on a private property in Winkelman, Arizona in January 2014 and travelled 1,374 feet (419 metres). He collapsed from the G-force afterwards ad needed three days to recover. The distance would have been enough to clear the Snake River Canyon which daredevil Evil Knievel failed to clear in 1974. Mr Hughes built his latest rocket at the “Rocket Ranch” in Apple Valley, California. He said: “I want to inspire others - and you have to do something incredible to get anybody's attention.”

The homemade contraption will hurtle over the ghost town of Amboy in the Mojave Desert, which has a population of four. Mr Hughes received permission from Albert Okura who purchased the rights to Amboy in 2005 for £328,000 ($435,000). Mr Okura said: “It is absolutely the most wacky promotional proposal I have had since I purchased the entire town in 2005.

638,"Bread, in all its various forms, is the most widely consumed food in the world.

Bread, in all its various forms, is the most widely consumed food in the world. Not only is it an important source of carbohydrates, it’s also portable and compact, which helps to explain why it has been an integral part of our diet for thousands of years. In fact, recent scholarship suggests humans started baking bread at least 30,000 years ago.

Prehistoric man had already been making gruel from water and grains, so it was a small jump to starting cooking this mixture into a solid by frying it on stones. A 2010 study by the National Academy of Sciences discovered traces of starch (likely from the roots of cattails and ferns) in prehistoric mortar and pestle-like rocks. The roots would have been peeled and dried before they were ground into flour and mixed with water. Finally, the paste would be cooked on heated rocks.

But how did humanity get from this prehistoric flatbread to a fluffy, grocery store loaf? There were three primary innovations that created “modern” bread.

1. Leavening

 Leavening is what makes bread rise into a light and fluffy loaf. Bread without leavening is a known as flatbread, and is the most closely related to mankind’s first breads. Examples include Middle Eastern pita, Indian naan and Central American tortillas.

The most common leavening for bread is yeast. Yeast floats around in the air, looking for a nice place to make a home—like a starchy bowl of flour and water. The first leavened bread was likely the result of some passing yeast making a home in a bowl of gruel. The yeast began eating the sugars present in grain, and excreting CO2, producing bubbles that resulted in lighter, airier bread. Commercial yeast production dates back to the skilled bread makers of Ancient Egypt around 300 B.C.

2. Refined Flour

 The earliest bread grains would have been ground by hand with rocks. This would have resulted in coarse, whole grain bread—the descendants of which are dark, rustic breads from Europe, like pumpernickel. The Mesopotamians refined this process around 800 B.C., using two flat, circular stones, stacked on top one another to grind the grain. These stones were continuously rotated by draft animals or slaves. This “milling”—which was the genesis for how we create flour today–created smooth, finely ground flour that quickly became prized as a status symbol. The desire for the whitest, most refined bread continued through the modern era, and later advancements included the sifting of flour to remove the bran and the germ and the bleaching of the flour itself.

3. Mechanized Slicing. 

 For hundreds of years, the finest white breads were sold in whole loaves to be cut at home—like a French baguette. The New York Public Library’s “Lunch” exhibit notes: “Nineteenth and early 20th-century cookbooks and magazines gave highly specific advice about lunchtime sandwich making. For ladies and children, the bread was supposed to be sliced very thinly and the crusts removed. For workers, thick slices with crusts were deemed more appropriate.”

But in 1917, itinerant jeweler Otto Rohwedder created the first mechanized bread slicer. Initially, many companies were convinced that housewives wouldn’t be interested, and his bread-slicing machine wasn’t installed in a factory until 1928. However, within two years, 90% of store-bought bread was factory sliced.

Progress led us to what was supposed to be the ideal loaf of bread: white, ultra-fluffy and pre-cut into even slices. This perfect bread was dubbed “American.” By this standard, Wonderbread should have been the last loaf of bread we ever needed. But modern science has uncovered the nutritional benefit of whole grains, and more and more consumers prefer the toothsome texture and nutty taste of a rustic loaf.

If you feel inspired to replicate a prehistoric recipe like I was, I’ll warn you that Bob’s Red Mill does not make a “Cattail/Fern Blend Flour”—yet. Settle for a “10 Grain Breakfast Cereal” full of ancient grains, like millet, coarsely ground.

Then, visit your local home improvement store, and poke around the slate tiling. You may be able to nab a few pieces of broken tile for free. Or, if you live somewhere they are easily accessible, simply walk outside and pick up a flat rock.

Now, you need to build a big fire. (That’s what I did at the Old Stone House of Brooklyn, a historic site that’s surrounded by children’s park.)

Let the flames die down until you have a bed of glowing, hot coals. Set the slate tiles on top of the coals, and wait about 10 minutes. Combine three cups of grain with about a cup of water and mix into a thick, workable paste. Form the dough into one-inch thick patties, and place them on the stones. After five minutes, flip them with a piece of bark—and you’ll be amazed to see the grain is browning on the heated rock. They may stick, so I recommend greasing your cooking rocks before hand.

In about 10 minutes, you’ll have a pile of hot, crispy cakes. The outside is crunchy and tastes like popcorn, the inside is moist and dense. I fed one to one of the children in the park, who described it as “pretty good,” though it’s possible she was just being nice.",mainstream,M10d53,flat.earth
163,"The “body hacking” movement is about implanting into the human body technology such as RFID chips, cameras and even LED lights. By bypassing health and ethical issues associated transhumanism, this body hacking pushes this movement to strange new frontiers.

As stated in my previous articles about the subject, transhumanism has been heavily promoted in mass media in the past years, whether it be through movies, music videos, video games and documentaries. Often, the word “transhumanism” isn’t even used. Instead, we simply show how a robotic enhancement “upgrades” the human body and makes it cooler, effectively selling the idea to people who believe they are being entertained – especially young people.

A by-product of this trend is “body hacking”, a movement that forgoes the ethical and philosophical questions associated with transhumanism to go right into drilling robotic parts onto one’s body. While many of us dread the day when microchips implants will be a requirement in a dystopian society, some people actually pay to have it done to them.

Here’s an interesting article about the movement from NPR.

A curious crowd lingered around Amal Graafstra as he carefully unpacked a pair of gloves, a small sterile blanket and a huge needle. A long line of people were waiting to get tiny computer chips implanted into their hands.

Graafstra had set up shop in a booth in the middle of an exhibit hall at the Austin Convention Center in Texas’ capital, where he gathered last month with several hundred others who call themselves “body hackers” — people who push the boundaries of implantable technology to improve the human body.

The movement evokes visceral reactions, brings up safety and ethical concerns and quickly veers into sci-fi questions about the line between human and cyborg.

Graafstra is a pioneer in the space. Using his own body to experiment, he designed bio-safe magnets and the microchip he was about to implant into the hand of A.J. Butt, who was sporting a tall, blue mohawk.

The implantable RFID chips hold encrypted information, and their unique ID numbers can be used to open doors or unlock the owner’s smartphone, which is what Butt wanted to do.

Butt took a deep breath. The needle plunged into his skin at the base of his thumb, and a chip bigger than a grain of rice slipped just below the surface.

Across the way, Sasha Rose, who was working a meditation booth at the convention, watched the people line up to be “chipped.”

She shook her head: This was the craziest thing she had seen. She wondered about Graafstra’s credentials. She thought this was a medical procedure, so should he be performing it? Did his clients know the potential consequences of carrying personal information on a device inside their skin?

“More than the crazy concept, it’s actually people’s willingness to accept it. That’s why it’s crazy to me,” Rose said. “People are just willing to just line up and go, ‘Yeah, stick that in me.’ ”

At night, many of the convention-goers gathered at a club on Austin’s Sixth Street.

Graafstra was outside with Ryan O’Shea, whose company Grindhouse Wetware made the Internet squirm earlier this year when it released a close-up surgery video of one of its implants called Northstar. In it, a man gets a small incision in his hand, and then, with a metallic tool dipped into it, the skin is lifted to produce a cavity where a round subdermal implant with five LED lights is placed.

The result looks dystopian — the incision is stitched with black thread, and LED lights make the skin on the hand glow red.

But body hackers view the world differently, Graafstra said. They believe technology has reached a point where it can improve the human body instead of just fixing what’s broken.

“A patient may someday come very soon and say, ‘My eye is totally fine, but I want an eye that can see infrared. And I want an eye that can zoom,’ ” Graafstra said.

That kind of future — where the human body is augmented by technology — is the goal of many of these experiments.

O’Shea said Grindhouse Wetware is using its LED device to test how long a device like it can remain charged inside a body, and Graafstra said his RFID chip is a small attempt at merging digital identity with physical identity.

“I think once people realize, ‘Oh, it’s OK that my grandma has a pacemaker’ … people are going to start to accept this,” O’Shea said. “You know, the era of transhumanism, I would say, is here. So let’s accept that and then see where that logically takes us.”

Inside the club, a drone hovered above the dance floor. The polished steel and the electronic dance music gave it a futuristic feel.

Standing near the bar was Tony Salvador, who studies social values and how they affect technology at Intel. He was at the conference to get a feel of when and if “body hacking” may be accepted into the mainstream.

Sometimes, he said, technology moves too fast and outpaces accepted social boundaries — not to mention laws. He argued that was part of the reason why early wearers of Google Glass were called “glassholes.”

“It created a social misunderstanding,” Salvador said. “You didn’t know what was going on.”

To Salvador, the boundaries of acceptance are a matter of our social philosophy, an area that he argued was driven by esoteric discourse without tangible moral and ethical recommendations.

The philosophers, he said, are letting us down.

Alva Noë, a philosopher at the University of California, Berkeley and a contributor to NPR’s 13.7: Cosmos and Culture blog, has written extensively on what he calls “cyborgian naturalness.” He disagreed that the modern philosophers dropped the ball, saying that tackling the matter would involve unpacking two questions:
• Is it OK to cut into human bodies for these kinds of experiments?
• How much tolerance should society have for artificially enhancing the body?

To the first question, Noë said he found the “body hacking” experimentation on humans “ethically disturbing” and couldn’t fathom a doctor or any other scientists conducting these kinds of operations.

The second question was more complicated.

“We don’t condemn people for using glasses to see better,” he said. “But we do start to think taking speed to cope with your work life is questionable.”

Because those kinds of judgments are an ethical question, drawing a tolerance line may always be a moving target, he said.

“We may reach consensuses and then lose them,” Noë said. “Just as there was once a consensus where it was OK to smoke to function effectively, and now we have the consensus that, increasingly, it’s not OK to do that.”

If there’s a rock star in the body-hacking movement, it’s Neil Harbisson, a colorblind artist from Barcelona who persuaded a doctor to implant a camera in the back of his head. The antenna, as he calls it, essentially lets Harbisson listen to colors by detecting the dominant color in front of him and translating it into musical notes.

The way he tells it, a medical ethics committee in Europe had refused to sign off on the operation, but a doctor agreed to perform the surgery anonymously. From it, Harbisson emerged with a camera connected to a device on the back of his skull, its lens dangling in front of his face on a rod that arcs over his head.

As he walked the streets of Austin, he described how he perceived the world: the red traffic light sounded like an A note; the green grass sounded like an F.

In his keynote address at the conference, Harbisson said the first time he heard those colors in his sleep, he felt truly cyborg. Now, he no longer identifies as human but as a “cybernetic organism.”

“If we define ourselves as organisms, suddenly our group is wider,” he said. “We are on the same level as an insect, or as a cat, or as a plant.”

Harbisson is well aware of how the world perceives him. He moved from Barcelona to New York City in search of “peace” with another friend in the transhumanist movement, Moon Ribas. Ribas has an electronic device in her arm that she said vibrates when there is an earthquake anywhere in the world.

On more than one occasion, people have tried to rip off his antenna, Harbisson said. That’s part of the reason why he co-founded the Cyborg Foundation to advocate for “cyborg rights.”

When asked if he’s ever thought about just taking the antenna off, Harbisson demurred.

“To me, it’s much stronger, the wish to sense what’s around me, than the fact that people keep annoying me,” he said, adding that maybe, in the future, as others get new senses, he’ll be considered normal.",conspiracy,C01763,flat.earth
631,"""They [penguins] are charismatic, endearing and in serious trouble,"" warned NBC’s Anne Thompson on the Dec. 12, 2007, ""Nightly News."" Thompson didn’t include any disagreement.

While the networks had plenty of time to worry about the future of birds, most network news shows didn’t take much time to include any other point of view even though hundreds of scientists have expressed skepticism of manmade climate change theory.

Another NBC reporter, Kerry Sanders, hyped the threat of warming to polar bears and walruses on Dec. 9, 2007, ""a world scientists say may melt away by 2050."" Sanders didn’t include any scientists who disagreed with that claim.

The lack of balance on the issue prompted one network journalist, John Stossel of ABC, to do a story on the media’s one-sidedness on “20/20” Oct. 19, 2007.

“You’ve heard the reports. The globe is warming. And it’s our fault. And the consequences will be terrible. But you should know there is another side to this story,” teased Stossel as he began his “Give me a Break” segment.

There is another side to the issue. In one story, Stossel interviewed four scientists critical of the so-called “consensus” on global warming. That’s four more dissenting scientists than CBS put on its network in six entire months.

To better assess network behavior on this key topic, the Business & Media Institute examined 205 stories from ABC, CBS and NBC that mentioned ""global warming"" or ""climate change"" between July 1, 2007, and Dec. 31, 2007.

BMI found skepticism was shut out of a vast majority of reports. Overall, a measly 20 percent had any dissent at all referenced by a journalist or guest.

Skeptical voices were suppressed by the networks, outnumbered by nearly a 7-to-1 ratio by those promoting fear of climate change or being used by the network for the same purpose. CBS had an even worse record: nearly 38 proponents to one skeptic.

Lengthy segments like Scott Pelley’s Oct. 21, 2007, ""60 Minutes"" story on ""The Age of Megafires"" certainly had time to include an alternative point of view to the notion that global warming is largely responsible for bigger, hotter fires in the American West. But Pelley skipped those voices – voices like a University of California Merced professor published on the Washington Spokesman-Review Web site about the California wildfires.

According to Alan Zarembo’s Oct. 24, 2007, story, “Scientists said it would be difficult to make that case, given the combustible mix of drought and wind that has plagued the region for centuries or more.”

Anthony Westerling, a UC-Merced professor and climate scientist, told Zarembo that the wildfires were the result of two “staples of the region’s climatic history,” meaning “strong Santa Ana winds” and “a drought that turned much of the hillsides to bone-dry kindling.”

""Neither can be attributed to climate change,"" said Westerling.

The near blackout of skepticism on the networks didn’t come as much of a surprise, since reporters like Pelley have been much more than onlookers in the story of global warming. In many cases they have become advocates – even going “to the ends of the earth” “to find evidence of climate change.”

Ann Curry of NBC’s “Today” made that clear on Oct. 29, 2007: “[O]ur mission, of course, is to find evidence of climate change.”

When people with other views were mentioned, it sometimes came with a denigrating label like “deniers” or “cynics.” Such critics were also portrayed as flat-earthers by journalists and guests. One person skeptical of manmade climate change, a Kentucky state representative, managed to get on the air but was treated to an exceptionally hostile interview by ABC’s Bill Weir.

There were many other flaws in the reporting that created a very one-sided perspective. Journalists repeatedly phrased questions or made statements indicating human-caused warming was a fact, and they included opinions of politicians, movie stars, musicians and ordinary people like bankers instead of relying on scientists.

But according to Dr. Pat Michaels viewers would be better served by hearing both sides. “They would benefit from appreciating the true scientific diversity on the topic. The arguments against these gloom and doom global warming scenarios are much stronger than the arguments for them,” Michaels told BMI.

According to NBC’s Brian Williams, “There’s no shortage of folks out there saying it’s [global warming is] not all that bad.” Williams was teasing a “Nightly News” story on August 15 that included two other voices: Dr. Pat Michaels, a research professor of environmental sciences, and Marlo Lewis, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

Williams was certainly right – there are hundreds of scientists from around the world who question the global warming “consensus” – but in the news the latter half of 2007 you had to look hard to find them.

On the three networks, 80 percent of stories (167 out of 205) didn’t mention skepticism or anyone at all who dissented from global warming alarmism. CBS did the absolute worst job. Ninety-seven percent of its stories (34 out of 35) ignored other opinions. Williams’ own network, NBC, came in a close second with 85 percent (76 out of 89) excluding skepticism. ABC was the most balanced network, but still censored dissent from 64 percent of its stories (34 out of 53).

But dissent flourishes. The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee released a list on Dec. 20, 2007, of more than 400 skeptical scientists from different fields – astrophysics, geology, climatology, meteorology and others. The release didn’t even earn a news brief from one of the three networks as of Dec. 31, 2007.

Even when one show claimed it would represent a range of opinions on the issue, it didn’t. On Oct. 30, 2007, NBC “Today” co-host Matt Lauer teased the upcoming “Ends of the Earth” broadcasts saying to Meredith Vieira, “And you’re going to be interviewing all the experts talking about the issues of climate change.” (emphasis added)

Vieira replied, “Absolutely. Getting into a whole debate, too, because some people believe there’s an effect of climate change, others say not really. So we’re going to discuss all of it and give viewers at home real tips on what you can do.”

But on Nov. 5 and 6, 2007 as “Today” went to the “Ends of the Earth,” the only “experts” Vieira spoke to were former vice president Al Gore, Chip Giller of Grist.org – a left-wing environmental Web site – and Katherine Wroth, co-author of “Wake Up and Smell the Planet.”

Grist is an extreme publication. David Roberts of the environmentalist magazine called for ""war crimes trials for these bastards ¬– some sort of climate Nuremberg,"" referring to the climate change ""denial industry."" (Roberts later retracted his comment, but not until it received a strongly negative response.)

The only skepticism of global warming “consensus” that came up was a brief mention by Vieira as she interviewed Gore. She asked Gore about John Christy, one scientist formerly with the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), who criticized Gore’s predictions in an op-ed printed in The Wall Street Journal. Gore shot back calling Christy an “outlier.”

Vieira didn’t question Gore’s remark or give Christy an opportunity to respond to the attack. Perhaps if she had, Christy would have echoed his remarks from the Nov. 1, 2007, Wall Street Journal:

“I see neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see. Rather, I see a reliance on climate models (useful but never ‘proof’) and the coincidence that change in carbon dioxide and global temperatures have loose similarity over time,” said Christy.

He continued, “We [dissenting scientists] discount the possibility that everything is caused by human actions, because everything we’ve seen the climate do has happened before. Sea levels rise and fall continually. The Arctic ice cap has shrunk before. One millennium there are hippos swimming in the Thames, and a geological blink later there is an ice bridge linking Asia and North America.”

Journalists practically drooled over Al Gore during Live Earth interviews and after he won the Nobel Peace Prize. In contrast, people with alternative views barely got face time on the networks. Instead, they received insults and hostile questions.

The ugliest treatment of a skeptic was by Bill Weir on Nov. 18, 2007, “Good Morning America.” He was interviewing Democratic state representative Bill Gooch from Kentucky.

Weir peppered Gooch with hardball questions and even attacked Gooch’s motives:

Gooch made it clear that he supported an open debate, saying, “[T]here is another side of the story. I think what we have is we have the problem of global warming about to become a political problem when lawmakers in Congress, when governors in states, when even the courts start to act in ways that are gonna affect the American people in severe ways.” Gooch then mentioned the possible $6-trillion cost of one bill to deal with global warming.

“And what I wanna make sure that we do is that if we act, we have the science right,” explained Gooch.

Weir wasn’t satisfied: “But, but according to all these scientists, the more handwringing we do, the more we dither on this, the worse it’s going to get. And what if you’re wrong? What if this is, in fact, a global catastrophe? Isn’t it a moral imperative as a public servant to err on the side of planetary survival and get something done?”

Instead of letting Gooch debate with someone who disagreed, Weir filled that role himself. He came across as a passionate advocate for “something” that would supposedly aid “survival,” ignoring the cost, accuracy, and his supposed objectivity.

Journalists also called skeptics “deniers,” conjuring images of Holocaust deniers, and cast them as flat-earthers – ironically forgetting that there was once a scientific consensus that the earth was flat.

When Gore attacked Dr. Christy [who was mentioned by Meredith Vieira] on “Today” Nov. 5, 2007, Gore specifically compared people critical of anthropogenic (human-caused) global warming to people who think the Earth is flat.

“Well, he’s an outlier, he no longer belongs to the IPCC. And he is way outside the scientific consensus … There are still people who believe that the Earth is flat,” said Gore.

Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger made the same disparaging comparison on July 16, 2007 “Early Show” on CBS. After co-host Harry Smith said, “[I] asked why some people still don’t believe we have a problem.”

“Well, I think that there is [sic] still a lot of people that still think that the world is flat,” said Schwarzenegger.

NBC’s chief environmental affairs correspondent Anne Thompson said, ""He is proudly a denier,"" of research professor and CATO senior fellow Dr. Pat Michaels.

Michaels told BMI, “She has no idea what she’s talking about. I have written and spoken repeatedly in the last 15 years that human beings are responsible for most of the warming in the past century.” What Michaels disagrees on is whether such warming will result in environmental catastrophe.

Recalling that NBC interview, Michaels continued, “The interview was great, but she pulled out one little piece and took it completely out of context. It was really, really disappointing. The interview was conducted in a very professional fashion, it was the editing that clearly did not reflect the tone and content of the overall interview.”

Thompson actually included two dissenting views in that Aug. 15, 2007, “Nightly News” but undermined both their opinions by implying they were not experts and were only making trouble: “Climate experts say whether hired guns or honest dissenters, deniers are confusing the issue and delaying solutions.”

A paltry 37 people expressing skepticism were included in six months of TV news coverage on the issue across three networks. That included all kinds of people like politicians or government employees, business representatives, celebrities, ordinary people and unidentified people. Only seven of them were scientists like Michaels.

CBS practically banned skeptics from its network, including only four and not a single scientist. The network seemed to adopt the mentality of CBS journalist Scott Pelley, who referred to global warming skeptics as “deniers” in March 2006 when he said, “If I do an interview with [Holocaust survivor] Elie Wiesel, am I required as a journalist to find a Holocaust denier?” Recent “60 Minutes” segments from Pelley indicated he hasn’t changed his mind about balanced journalism.

Those skeptical of the environmental impact of Gore’s Live Earth concerts on July 7, 2007 also earned scorn from the media – even those like Bob Geldof who weren’t questioning the science.

“[T]here have been cynics out there who question whether the artists are practicing what they preach,” said NBC’s Lester Holt on July 7, 2007 “Today.”

ABC’s Bill Weir claimed that “all the scientists” urge immediate action to stop global warming, but it wasn’t just scientists the three networks relied on to make that case. Far from it.

There were politicians and government workers. Musicians like Madonna and Dave Matthews. Movie star Leonardo DiCaprio. And quite possibly, your next-door neighbor.

What those celebrities said had little to do with science and everything to do with advocacy. Singer KT Tunstall, a Live Earth performer, was quoted by ABC on July 7, 2007.

“I think I am an environmentalist. I mean, I don’t have a car. I live in a small apartment,” said Tunstall.

Madonna urged Live Earth attendees, ""If you wanna save the planet, let me see you jumping up and down.""

But it wasn’t just globe-trotting stars telling people the planet was in danger and crowding out any other perspective.

Politicians offered perhaps more substance, but certainly not much more science than the Hollywood types. In addition to fawning over Gore, networks interviewed Florida Gov. Charlie Crist (R), California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (Independent), among others.

Reporters also relied on ordinary voices to reinforce the idea that global warming was already a major threat impacting our daily lives.

Only 15 percent of the people used to support global warming positions were scientists – identified as a ""scientist"" or with a specialty like genetics, ecology, biology or oceanography. A total of 71 scientists were included in six months of coverage. But networks turned to ordinary, unidentified people nearly a third more often than the scientists (101 to 71.)

Networks turned to ordinary people like two Live Earth concertgoers and the unidentified female “consumer” quoted by ABC “World News with Charles Gibson” on Sept. 14, 2007.

“You know, I think everybody’s got to think about it. We’ve got to change,” said a woman in a story about carbon labeling of food products.

Those quotes were used to underline the points that reporters made. One story on “Today” Nov. 6, 2007, warned that melting ice could kill off polar bears. Reporter Kerry Sanders included three unidentified people talking about polar bears – supporting his remark that “Worst-case scenario: If the Arctic ice continues to melt, in the next 100 years, the U.S. Wildlife Service says the only place you’ll find a polar bear will be at the zoo.”

Worries over Arctic melt flooded global warming coverage in the latter half of 2007, but as columnist John Tierney wrote in the Jan. 1, 2008 New York Times: “When the Arctic sea ice last year [2007] hit the lowest level ever recorded by satellites, it was big news and heralded as a sign that the whole planet was warming. When the Antarctic sea ice last year reached the highest level ever recorded by satellites, it was pretty much ignored.”

No Need for Debate, Warming is ‘Fact’



To many in the news media, global warming and its reported cause were already established fact. It was clear by the way some journalists talked about warming that they had accepted Gore’s insistence that “the debate’s over.”

Just listen to CBS’s Harry Smith: “Before we do anything else, there is, in fact, global climate change. It really affects some climates much more than others and it’s really caused some real serious problems.” Those serious problems Smith was talking about were allergies during a segment on the Aug. 7, 2007 “Early Show.”

ABC’s Sam Champion seemed to agree. Champion called the fourth U.N. IPCC report “definitive” on Sept. 5, 2007 and said he had been “investigating the alarming numbers of animals that are disappearing due to global warming” in July.

But Dan Harris went the farthest on Dec. 2, 2007 in a story about security risk and global warming. The “World News Sunday” host told viewers to “Think about this scenario: global warming contributes to a severe drought and food shortage in a third-world country. The government collapses. Warlords take over. America is forced to intervene.”

Shockingly, Harris then claimed: “It’s already happened, Somalia, 1993, with disastrous consequences.”

Harris excluded expertise on the Somali situation or any context. Human Rights Watch, a liberal international organization, gave a very different perspective at the time of the crisis back in 1992:

“Somalia has historically been subject to famines, especially in the pastoral areas of the center and north … The current famine that threatens Mogadishu and south-central Somalia is radically different in origin and impact. Drought has played only a minor role, and the main victims are poor townspeople, farmers and rural laborers.”

The ABC correspondent didn’t include any statements about the way the war was thought to have contributed to the famine.

Journalists weren’t the only ones claiming that global warming was a fact, though. But the people journalists chose to interview also included Gore saying the “debate’s over” and didn’t dispute Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s incorrect statement that there was “zero dissent” on the issue, or Leonardo DiCaprio’s assertion of a “90-percent consensus.”

“Consensus” was rarely questioned by reporters at all, and ABC’s Bill Weir even used the concept of “these 4,000 or so scientists” to hammer at one person expressing a different view.

The media did a terrible job of actually explaining what the IPCC was. Atmospheric scientist Dr. John Christy told Earth & Sky Web site that the “IPCC would do well to define what each participant truly contributes to each product (i.e. Summary for Policy Makers vs. Full Text) so that the world would know that thousands of scientists never reached a ‘consensus’ on anything.”

“When the Full Text is developed, ‘consensus’ is a concept held by the chapters’ Lead Authors who often ignore or contradict positions offered by the Contributing Authors and Reviewers,” explained Christy.

David Henderson, a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), wrote a detailed criticism of the IPCC in the Oct. 11, 2007 Wall Street Journal. He called the process “flawed” and biased because “the Panel members and those who appoint them are of course identified with the policies of their governments And virtually all governments are formally committed … to the ‘stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere’.”

“[T]his puts in doubt the accepted basis of official climate policies,” concluded Henderson.

It Don’t Cost a Thing if It’s Got That Climate Swing



Not only did the networks censor skepticism from stories, but the cost of proposed solutions, small or large, was routinely omitted.

BMI found that 90 percent of the stories didn’t mention cost at all, even though the networks urged immediate action to stop the “climate crisis.”

“NBC Nightly News” ignored cost in a Dec. 18, 2007 report about the recent energy bill passed by Congress.

“What America drives could change dramatically under the energy bill,” said Anne Thompson before quoting David Hamilton of the left-wing environmentalist group Sierra Club.

Hamilton lauded parts of the bill during the “Fueling Change” segment: “This bill means that we will get all the same safety, all the same performance that we’ve ever gotten from our cars, but we’ll get it with more miles to the gallon.”

Thompson and Hamilton both ignored the obvious cost to auto manufacturers of designing vehicles that will be able to meet the new fuel efficiency requirements. Likely, those costs will be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher vehicles prices.

Other plans to curb greenhouse-gas emissions could cost trillions of dollars. One estimate by business consulting firm CRA International put a $4-trillion to $6-trillion price tag on the Lieberman-Warner bill, which would mandate scaling back emissions levels to 1990s levels by 2020. That would cost each American man, woman and child $494 a year.

Network reporters also didn’t focus on how much is already being spent. As the Business & Media Institute reported in its “Fire and Ice” study, more than 99.5 percent of American climate change funding comes from the government – taxpayers – and we spend $4 billion per year on climate change research.

The Kyoto treaty that was never ratified by the U.S. carried an estimated cost of $440 billion per year for America. The Senate voted 95 to 0 to reject it.

BMI examined all ABC, CBS and NBC news transcripts that included the terms “global warming” or “climate change” during the most recent six month period – from July 1, 2007, to Dec. 31, 2007. Only stories mentioning those terms were included in the study.

The stories were split into two categories: stories and casual mentions. Casual mentions encompassed anchor briefs shorter than 50 words and longer stories that only mentioned global warming or climate change incidentally (the story was not about that issue).

“Dissent,” for the purpose of this study, included any uncertainty [""I don’t know""], alternative opinions about warming, and caution against making climate change policy decisions without more information. It also included criticism of “solutions” to global warming and “awareness” campaigns like Live Earth ¬– even when the critic wasn’t disagreeing with manmade climate change, but just the usefulness of worldwide rock concerts.

People quoted in a story that supported climate change claims were placed in the proponent category because their comments were used by the network to support the manmade global warming viewpoint. There was one exception. In one story, scientist Bill Nye presented both positions on the issue in a balanced manner. He was counted as neutral in that story.

354,"A rapper-turned-flat-Earther is attempting to prove that the world is not round by crowdfunding his own satellite launch.

B.o.B, born Bobby Ray Simmons Jr., is a rapper from Georgia who once recorded a diss track about physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, after the two got into a Twitter fight in 2016 about whether the Earth is round. The rapper is a member of the Flat Earth Society, a group of people who are convinced that the planet is flat, not round. A scroll through B.o.B's Twitter feed also reveals a number of other conspiracy beliefs: He is an anti-vaxxer, a 9/11 truther and also, for some reason, believes that oil does not form from the remains of organic material buried under pressure.

B.o.B's new GoFundMe has a $1 million goal and has raised $2,701 from 98 people in the five days since he put up the request. (He pledged the first $1,000 himself.) The goal, according to the rapper, is to launch a satellite as far into space as necessary to ""find the curve"" of Earth. [7 Ways to Prove the Earth Is Round (Without Launching a Satellite)]

How we know the Earth is round

Despite myths about Christopher Columbus believing he might sail off the edge of the Earth, humans have known that the world is round for a very, very long time. The Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras left the first written arguments for a round Earth in 500 B.C. Ancient Greeks thought the sphere was the perfect shape, so it stood to reason, Pythagoras figured, that the Earth was spherical. A few hundred years later, according to the American Physical Society (APS), Aristotle dropped some scientific evidence into the debate. He pointed out that during lunar eclipses, Earth's shadow on the moon is curved; ships going over the horizon seem to drop down, hull-first, rather than becoming tinier and tinier until they disappear; and different stars are visible from different vantage points on Earth, which wouldn't make much sense if the planet were flat.

The Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, born in 276 B.C., even managed to determine the circumference of the Earth. He did this, according to the APS, by measuring the angle of the shadow of a stick stuck in the ground on the summer solstice in Alexandria, on what is today the Egyptian coast. He knew that in Aswan, Egypt (then known as Syene), the sun cast no shadows on the day of the solstice — it was directly overhead. The difference in the sun's angle between Syene and Alexandria corresponded to one-fiftieth of a complete circle, so Eratosthenes realized that if he knew the exact distance between the two cities, he'd just need to multiply to determine the full circumference of the Earth.

The mathematician had to hire surveyors to walk the distance with precisely measured steps, but he eventually landed on a total circumference for the planet of between 24,000 and 29,000 miles (39,000 to 47,000 kilometers). He turned out to be remarkably accurate: Around the equator, the planet's circumference is 24,900 miles (40,072 km).

So if the ancient Greeks had it figured out, how can anyone still believe in a flat Earth in the age of satellites and rocket launches? [Top 10 Conspiracy Theories]

The resurgence of flat-Earth beliefs started in the early 1800s with a writer named Samuel Rowbotham, who developed an entire alternative cosmology around the idea that the Earth is a flat plane enclosed by a dome of space, surrounded by a perimeter of ice walls. Rowbotham's philosophy was that the Earth looks flat, from a human's point of view walking on the surface, so everyone who said they could show otherwise must be lying. The International Flat Earth Society, formed in 1956, draws from Rowbotham's views. In the mid-1990s, the president of the group claimed to have 3,500 paying members, according to his New York Times obituary. Today, the Flat Earth Society website claims to have 555 members, the most recent being B.o.B.

Flat-Earthers don't trust NASA or any other space agency. According to the Flat Earth Society's FAQs, astronauts are being bribed or coerced into lying; airplane windows distort views to make it look like the horizon curves; and the International Space Station is a hoax. Also, gravity isn't real.

An independent satellite launch may or may not convince B.o.B that the Earth really does curve, but he may find the process a bit difficult if he doesn't accept that the planet is round. To launch a satellite (or any other object) into space, you have to take into account the Earth's radius. In the formula for the speed needed to achieve orbit, V = sqrt (g0*Re^2/(Re + h)), ""Re"" is the mean planetary radius. Astronomer Johannes Kepler sorted this out in the 1600s, according to NASA.

It remains to be seen whether B.o.B will ever get a chance to launch a satellite, anyway. According to The Verge, GoFundMe has frozen the rapper's donation account, meaning he won't be able to access the funds unless he can provide more information that the money will not be mismanaged.",mainstream,M15435,flat.earth
762,"People who belief in the Flat Earth Theory hold the conviction that the earth is flat and not round. This theory started to become more and more popular around 2009 and is growing ever since. It is considered one of the most controversial conspiracy theories existing. They claim the Earth to be flat because for them it feels like and looks like it is. The ones believing in this Theory call themself “The Flat Earth Society” and the importance about this is that even though there is evidence to the contrary they claim those “to be fabrications of a ‘round Earth conspiracy’”(Wolchover).

The believers in the Flat Earth Theory think that the “Earth is a disc with the Arctic Circle in the center and Antarctica, a 150-foot-tall wall of ice, around the rim.”(Wolchover). Believers claim that the NASA guards protect those ice walls from people that try to climb over and fall from the disc. In their eyes they also believe that Earth’s gravity is an illusion and objects do not accelerate downward, they are “driven up by a mysterious force called dark energy”.

On the opposite end, there are countless photographs, videos, and imagery from astronauts and from the International Space Station that is enough evidence to show that the Earth is actually round, but the interesting part here is that even though there is evidence that prove their claims wrong in their eyes it is not considered real evidence and faked by the government.

Those who believe in it most likely misinterpret the evidence and are only looking for beliefs that would confirm their owns. This is also called confirmation bias. In this case they ignore the real evidence that the earth is round and label them as ‘fake’, whereas when something in any way would support their beliefs has to be correct. Another cognitive contribution is groupthink, which is a concept that people within a group “value harmony and coherence above rational thinking”(PsychologyToday). This often results in dysfunctional outcomes and irrational beliefs. In this case, Flat Earth Society members do not want to doubt or judge the others beliefs and therefore strengthen their owns.

The flat Earth model started in the ancient where many cultures believed in a flat Earth “until the classical the Bronze Age” (Wikipedia). It became more controversial again, because the moon landing in 1959 came with a lot of skepticism. Flat earth theorists believe that the moon landing was fake and the pictures and audios recorded from that time were fabrications. They believe that GPS devices and maps are fake and that the International Space Station is a fake space station, believing it would be cheaper to promote a fake station rather than build a real one. The primary social influence that maintains their belief is groupthink. Social reinforcement form like-minded people allows them to feel sane when they speak of the topic and feel that their opinions are respected and justified.

Even though this theory can be proven wrong by a lot of evidence, the human brain and different psychological concept show how one can persists with their beliefs due to groupthink or biases. Human also love searching for meaning and drawing connections between things that sometimes have no tangible connection between them. It is simply human nature.",mainstream,M172fb,chemtrails; flat.earth
243,"With every interesting celestial event these days, Christian prophecy theorists take to YouTube to share their speculation on why it's a ""sign"" and what it might just mean. But does God really communicate warnings this way in the sun, moon and stars? Does the Bible really instruct us to look for ""signs"" in the heavens? What are we to ""watch"" for according to Jesus? As you will learn, theorists (unintentionally) deceive themselves and others when they don't properly define and use the word ""sign"" the same way the Bible does. Get Scriptural answers to these important questions, ones that you won't find on YouTube no matter how many ""views"" a video has...

Since the Christian speculation over the ""four blood moons"" lunar eclipses of 2014-2015 failed and neither the Great Tribulation nor the Rapture happened as predicted, we're still here. That means now we get to discuss similar speculation about the latest solar eclipse or celestial event. Are you ready?

Once again, it's all thanks to YouTube... Yes, the same wonderful YouTube that brings you:
• any song or music video from your childhood you want to experience again,
• instructional videos to fix anything and everything in your life,

...also brings you theories that either were dismissed with the arrival of Science or that are too obviously contrived to ever spread through other channels that cost money or by free channels that are limited to much-less-persuasive text (like the original Web 1.0).

Why do you think flat Earth theory is in a resurgence? (No, NASA did not develop a time machine and bring back medieval people and teach them to blog.) It's because free video allows any ""thought"" (using the term loosely) to get bolstered up by convincing charts, photos and the silver tongues of persuasive on-screen personalities. Flat-earther Christians began emailing me in early 2015 right after a now popular YouTube video on the topic was posted:
• 2015, first flat-earther to write me: "" I haven't seen you write about the E yet, which by the way, fits way better with bible teachings. ""
• 2016, same person after writing a flat Earth article for him: ""Please cancel ALL emails to me. You are a and obviously have spent no time on researching the flat Earth.""

Likewise, because of YouTube, prophetic speculation is spreading about the latest interesting eclipse. It's even popular enough to break into mainstream news just like the 2014-2015 speculation did.

I say ""interesting"" eclipse because there are several eclipses (lunar or solar) every year that are simply ignored by our helpful YouTube ""watchmen."" Unless a celestial event has something extra (like taking place on Jewish holy days or happening seven years away from something else interesting) then you won't see a prophecy video on it. Eclipses are far too common to form the basis of a prophecy theory every single time they happen.

But the 2017 solar eclipse is an interesting one. Here are some of the factoids talked about this eclipse—along with my responses to help you think about them more critically yourself:
• Claim: ""The next total solar eclipse in America is in seven years and forms an X when combined with this eclipse. These eclipses could be marking out the seven year Tribulation!"" 

 Response: Where does the Bible say to look for eclipses to mark the Tribulation? Nowhere. What does it tell us to expect first? Jesus already said, ""when you see the Abomination of Desolation"" the Great Tribulation is next (Mt 24:15). Further, the seven-year-long 70th Week of Daniel cannot start this year as numerous prerequisites have not happened, like the Nuclear Middle East War, Elijah's coming, and most importantly the Good News of the Kingdom returning (Mt 24:14) (more on that below).
• Claim: ""The solar eclipse happens the day before the start of the Hebrew month of Elul."" 

 Response: ""Day before"" is kind of random and arbitrary. Wouldn't the eclipse need to happen on Elul 1 itself if you want to connect it to the past historical prophetic events of that day? That's what was done in 2014-2015 with eclipses on the very days of Passover and Sukkot by Mark Biltz. This time Mr. Biltz is happy enough with ""the day before"" to make a connection. This is a logical fallacy called ""moving the goal posts.""
• Claim: ""Jonah left for Nineveh on the day of Elul 1 after there was a major solar eclipse in Nineveh the month before."" 

 Response: See above that the eclipse is not on the day of Elul 1, so to be consistent, you must throw out any connection to Elul. As for ""the month before"" claim (generously granting that the dating of this ancient event is reliable), why would the Ninevites connect Jonah's arrival with an eclipse an entire month before? To reasonably expect people to connect an eclipse to something, that something needs to happen at the same time, such as right as Jonah arrived and started warning. Again, moving goal posts. (For a great depiction of something like this, see Mel Gibson's movie Apocalypto and how a solar eclipse causes the pagans to change plans immediately.)
• Claim: ""The solar eclipse is 40 days from Yom Kippur"" 

 Response: Actually, it's 41 days before Yom Kippur because it comes the day before Elul 1 which itself always starts the ""40 days of awe/repentance"" before Yom Kippur, yes? But even if it was 40 days, so what? Elul 1 comes every year without event. Eclipses come every year without event. Nothing in Scripture connects general eclipses with prophecy.
• Claim: ""World War 1 started in August, 1914 the same month there was a total solar eclipse over the Ottoman Empire (E. Europe) which ended with WW1."" 

 Response: Why is ""same month"" significant? As stated above, it's tenuous at best to connect an eclipse to any event that is not concurrent. Further, there have been half a dozen total solar eclipses in Europe since WW1, so why have we not had WW3-WW7 already? Because this WW1 eclipse claim comes from another logical fallacy called cherry-picking data.
• Claim: ""The last time an eclipse crossed only the United States was during WW1 on August 21, 1914"" 

 Response: I guess the implication here is that ""trouble"" is coming again this time? If this is how it works based on WW1, what happened to the total solar eclipse across the continent before WW2?? I guess there's not much of a pattern here when you include all the data but instead just draw a circle around the data that fits your theory, also called the Texas Sharpshooter fallacy.
• Claim: ""The path of the solar eclipse passes over counties that 95% voted for Trump"" 

 Response: What, you mean God is using the Sun to highlight his approval of Trump? Albeit only 95% approval...haha. I thought he was the Messiah, er, Cyrus LOL. (I am not against Trump per se, just some people take their adoration of him too far, in my opinion.)
• Claim: ""The path of the solar eclipse passes over SEVEN towns called Salem!""

 Response: What, you mean God is using the Sun to highlight his approval of Trump? Albeit only 95% approval...haha. I thought he was the Messiah,

There are many, many more claims than this about the eclipse because, just like with the 2012 Mayan Calendar speculation, as more people hear the idea, they perceive more connections of their own that spawn more YouTube videos. The above most frequently repeated claims are enough to see how arbitrary and subjective the ""evidence"" is for this eclipse being prophetically significant.

Q: ""What are the odds? It can't be just a coincidence!""

A: No it's not a coincidence but the odds are not as great as you think when you understand what it really is!

As the section above illustrated, the ""connections"" that are made to support the ""significance"" of the eclipse or other event use inconsistent rules. In other words, they use inconsistent rules and logic to connect whatever they can remember or imagine or Google that would impress people.
• If the event falls same day as a Biblical holy day...bingo!
• If it comes the day before a biblical date...close enough, bingo!
• If it comes the same month as something else big...bingo!
• If it comes seven years before something...bingo!

Obviously, when you employ flexible, moving goalposts or ""rules"" like this, you are able to find interesting factoids for any event or date you believe is significant. This is what happened with the 2012 Mayan Calendar date, and the 2014-2015 Four Blood Moons theory and we know how these turned out despite the claim, ""the odds of all these connections are astronomical!

This happens not because of legitimate coincides but rather due to a human psychological bias called Confirmation Bias. This bias causes us to ignore or reject evidence against our theory and accept and report all the evidence for it. Even when people present evidence against our theory (like this article!) their bias will use flexible rules and other moving goalposts to reject the evidence against it.

For example, here's another claim about the 2017 total solar eclipse regarding the name Salem:

Seven towns named Salem. So what, right? But wait, they found a verse to tie it to the eclipse. Drum roll again, please...

Look at that, will you, the word Salem is last part of the word Jerusalem and it's connected to an eclipse! ""What are the odds?""

The odds are very high indeed when you can ""cheat"" by matching any aspect of an eclipse to any part of any word in the Bible even remotely related to an eclipse. Contrivances like this only demonstrate the imagination and research genius of the prophecy theorist to justify their event as important. They don't provide any real Biblical proof that the event is prophetically significant.

By the way, real Biblical evidence for an event's prophetic significance would be along the lines of a direct quote from Jesus. Like him saying, ""When you see X, then the end shall come."" Turns out Jesus said something exactly like that, but not about an eclipse! (More below.)

Prophecy theories like this are not just based on specific claims about a particular eclipse or other celestial event. The theorists also quote numerous Biblical passages to justify their unusual focus on heavenly events in the first place. (Again, see the film Apocalypto for a reminder of how the pagans viewed eclipses. You could say Christians fearing eclipses again today is ""retro"" but in a negative way, much like flat Earth theory is retro. P.S. No judgment on the people, just the ideas they believe and, too often, beat other believers up over.)

For an example of the ""heavenly"" focus verses they employ, look at this partial transcription of a ""biblical astronomy"" YouTube video and see if you can spot any problems with the reasoning before I point them out:

Sounds reasonable, doesn't it? At least to most new to prophecy study. It's persuasive enough for many of them to hit the share button and send it to others to help warn them or ask their opinion. (I know for me I only ever watch a prophecy teaching on YouTube because someone shared it to ask my opinion of it.) The transcript above leads to a false conclusion to justify looking to the heavens for God's direction such as with eclipses.

Here's the problems with the arguments above:
• Psalm 19 tells us the heavens declare something, and it's a pretty broad concept at that: ""God's glory."" It uses a lot of poetic language (like anthropomorphism) to emphasize this. But there is no literal speech or language or communication on that level from the sky. There is enough expanse there for humanity to realize God exists and to be ""without excuse"" in denying this fact and disobeying him as Paul said (Rom 1:20). That's it for the normal, daily basis that the psalm is commenting on (with two rare exceptions, see 3 below).
• Because of this, the heavens cannot ever serve as a way for God to ""speak"" intelligibly to his children. For nearly all of us, space is just a random bunch of balls of light with different names, sizes and illumination levels. A few of these balls have vague or general historical meanings like the Signs of the Zodiac do. What it means when they light up or crisscross is anybody's guess, and guess away they do! This is why there are a million and one subjective opinions on ""what the eclipse means"" shared by prophecy theorists.
• The Bible already answers the question posed on how God has and will speak ""to all his children"" when the need comes to do that: through his end time prophet Elijah and lastly through seven literal thundering shouts of his voice (Ps 29:3=Rev 10:4) right before he brings his Kingdom to Earth at the 7th trumpet (Rev 11:15). Oh, God can speak to all his children at once with clear, human language when he wants to. He did this with all of ancient Israel at Mount Sinai and they consequently asked him to ""please, stop"" out of fear (Ex 20:19).

As you can tell, apart from God's greatness, the heavens do not communicate much at all very clearly to us humans. This is why God uses several other much better means to talk to humanity. As noted above, all these means use actual, real, human language. If God spoke in a way any less clear than that, no one could be held accountable to act on his instructions or warnings. They could rightly claim they did not understand because his ""heavenly lights language"" was incomprehensible.

But what about all those ""sign"" verses? Doesn't sign mean a message as with a ""For Sale"" ""sign?"" Doesn't God use the lights in the heavens to at least send simple informational warnings of end times events?

Not quite. Let's look at the common verses that are used to justify drawing attention to eclipses and other heavenly displays.

The thrust of Genesis 1:14 is that the heavenly lights would signal common divisions of time: ""seasons, days and years."" In the Bible, the month is based on the moon; months begin with the new (crescent) moon. Days begin when the sun sets or disappears. Stars in the sky change based on the season you are in. Years also can be marked by the solstices, or shortest or longest days of the year. That's what Genesis in context means by letting them be all things dealing with the calendar. It says nothing about ""let them be for prophetic warning signs from God"" like prophecy theorists wrongly wield (proof-text) the verse to mean.

In both of these passages the word for sign could also be translated as ""miracle,"" ""token"" or ""wonder."" Notice that none of those words convey the idea of ""communication/speech/warning"" as is portrayed by prophecy theorists. The point of the word is that there is a attention-catching display in the sky. It's called a ""wonder"" because it makes people ""wonder"" due to it being unclear and hard to explain.

Further, if you read Luke 21:25 in context, you do not find instructions to look for this sign to mean anything. It comes at the end of God's wrath, right before the Jesus appears. It's certainly proper to have a nice heavenly fanfare before his triumphant return. By then we'll already know the day he's coming.

Revelation 12 goes on to explain the meaning of the great signs of the Woman and the Dragon. The Dragon is the constellation Draco and also Satan. The Woman also works at many levels including the constellation Virgo, Mary and saints of Israel and of the Church. It shows plainly that the Woman gives birth to the Messiah who later is ""taken up"" to heaven (Acts 1:9=Rev 12:5). There is no connection in any way given between the Woman in heaven and the end times events. Later after she is found on the earth fleeing from the Dragon, she is indeed an end time character, too. The sign in the sky she portrayed earlier is never connected to her end time actions and existence. When people make such a connection they read into the text what is not there, ignoring what is there as they did connecting September 23, 2017 with Revelation 12.

As the previous section explained, when you look at the ""signs"" verses in context, they do not support the meaning for which they are used by Christian prophecy inventors. Each verse refers to a specific instance and application, such as calendar signs and the the sign on the day Jesus returns. They are not meant to give ""carte blanche"" or a blank check to justify ""scanning the heavens for any sign"" like Christian theorists do.

All that was obvious to me long ago and I have written on it before. Thinking deeper on this topic, I began I see another problem. The meaning of the word translated ""sign"" in our English Bible versions does not support the definition that prophecy theorists use it for. Sign, like many words, has several valid, possible literal meanings and connotations. A sign can have a short message in it like a billboard or ""For Sale"" sign does (""$1000 call 555-1212""). Or a sign can mean something as limited as a signal light to indicate your engine is malfunctioning or that the day is over like a sunset does.

Which one is the Bible intending? Let's clear up that confusion on the right definition of the English word ""sign"" to use:
• Prophecy Theorists: Sign = ""communication or message from God"" much like a ""billboard"" or ""God's day timer"" (to borrow from the title of Mark Biltz's book where he teaches watching for heavenly signs on God's calendar among other things).
• The Bible: Sign = ""wonder, display, token, signal"" again, much like a sunset or a car's dashboard engine warning light.

Here's what the problem is with prophecy theorists' portrayal of celestial ""signs"" with their limited and specific meanings in their context: It's like when our car's designated engine warning light goes off and we decide it means we need to call our mom because she misses us. In other words, we reject the simple, limited, contextual meaning of the sign and expand it to be not just something else from left field, but a complete communication like ""Aww... Mom misses me. I need to call her."" Meanwhile, all the engine light indicates is something quite vague and limited: something is wrong with the engine!

The final nail in the coffin of the approach of the prophecy theorists is that as they go about inventing new end time signs based on NASA charts and historical factoids, they completely ignore the one precursor end time sign that Jesus gave us. That sign is found hidden away in a single, puzzling verse in the middle of the Olivet Discourse:

""This"" gospel of the Kingdom? ""Which one was that again?""

Exactly! Until 2016 I did not know the answer to that, either. It had me stumped, too.

It's not our fault. Christianity does not teach any such ""this gospel of the Kingdom"" or we would not respond with blank stares when asking what it is. Christianity certainly teaches ""good news about Jesus"" just not the good news of Jesus, you know, the one that he taught on the rewards God gives people now who seek the coming Kingdom and God's righteousness (Mt 6:33).

Going further, if Christianity did teach the Good News of Jesus already, Jesus could not indicate it as an end time sign. We'd somehow have to know exactly when it reaches ""all nations,"" which one can never know for sure or easily. But if the Good News message of the Kingdom died out with Jesus and the apostles, then when it reappears on the Earth in our time, we then have a distinct clear and recognizable, unprecedented-in-2000-years sign. It will be so amazing that the worldwide spread of it in this social media/YouTube age is ensured. You won't be able to miss it.

If you want to understand this important topic fully now, see the study in my supporters section.

Finally, Here's The Real Role of Eclipses In End Time Prophecy!

By the way, the Good News of the Kingdom message will contain a built-in extra reason to ""obey it"" (2Th 1:8). I'm referring to the warning on end time events. In our time, you don't just need to repent to be saved, but also to follow God's end time escape instructions to survive what's coming.

Here's the kicker. Interestingly enough, one of first events of the end time ""beginning of sorrows"" (perhaps simultaneous with an earthquake or directly follow it) that Jesus warned about affecting the whole Earth is...

But not just any eclipse. In fact, it's going to be a weird combined, simultaneous solar and lunar eclipse:



Joel and Revelation both agree that, somehow, both the sun and moon will be eclipsed at the same time. Of course that is impossible today and I doubt most (if any) on Earth will be able to witness both. For a typical lunar eclipse, the sun and moon must be on opposite sides of the Earth. A solar eclipse at the same time would require another celestial body to be very near to Earth in order to block the sun. Or perhaps the object blocks the sun for both the moon and Earth...

However exactly it happens, such a new foreign body is identified by Revelation later (and only after analyzing it's many literal clues) as a dwarf planet it calls Wormwood (Rev 8:10-11; Note that the Greek word aster translated ""star"" is not specific to a star but can mean among other things planets of various sizes).

Notice also in context that even this unprecedented combination lunar and solar eclipse does not happen as an isolated incident. A great earthquake, so great that it shifts the Earth's entire topography significantly, also occurs with it. Not to mention so many shooting stars that the normal starry night sky scrolls away. How is this possible? The dwarf planet Wormwood is broken up at Earth's Roche Limit and partially disintegrates. It can then literally ""fall from heaven"" upon the Earth (Rev 8:10). It's dispersed slowly enough in small enough chunks to not end all life on Earth right then and there.

Now is it a ""sign?"" Revelation does not use that word but again, in the many meaning of the word sign, you could say among the first ""signs"" of Wormwood is a unique double eclipse. But we'll already know it's coming because of Elijah (and already be in safety in Judea as Psalm 91 depicts). So in one way it is but the way theorists look to eclipses to tell them the end ahead of time, it's definitely not.

Seeing this all in context, can you understand how incorrect it is for prophecy theorists to quote those verses above to support their attention to isolated eclipses (even if four similar ones happen in a row) like they did in 2014-2015? Can you understand how it's the same as seeing the dashboard engine indicator light go on, ignoring its ""check engine""-label context and deciding it means something completely different outside the car?

433,"The three largest Western countries, America, Canada, Australia and Europe maintain the most responsible birth rates in the world. The citizens of those countries practice birth control, which brought their birth rates down to 2.0 or less in the past 45 years. While Western thinking and intelligent action created stable societies, the rest of the world roared ahead by adding 3.5 billion in those 45 years and continues with 80 million, net gain, annually, or 1 billion added every 12 years. And, no end in sight as humans see a projected 3.1 billion more within 36 years by 2050.  Most Western elites continue urging the wealthy West not to stem the migrant tide [that adds 80 million net gain annually to the planet], but to absorb our global brothers and sisters until their horrid ordeal has been endured and shared by allten billion humans packed onto an ecologically devastated planet. Dr. Otis Graham, Unguarded Gates Annually, 18 million starve to death and at least 2 billion live within the human misery index of daily water and food scarcity. Notwithstanding, they keep reproducing without end, means or understanding. Those folks continue adding 80 million annually, so, in order to save themselves, they export endless millions of their numbers into stable Western countries who chose 2.0 birth rates. In the meantime, not one world leader addresses it. Not one Western leader touches the subject. Immigration remains the last taboo right up there with the Earth is flat; Adam and Eve constitute the first humans; the Bible is the final say; The sun and universe rotates around the Earth as spoken by the Pope; and finally, lets not deal with global climate change or the fact that we face complete Peak Oil energy exhaustion within 40 years. If we ignore it, the whole mess will go away. Answer: not on your life! Some of us deal with immigration because it not only adds to Canada, America, Europe and Australias final horrific population expansionsthe added numbers from the Third World, when they reach the First World, they begin to quintuple their use of resourcesthus magnifying the carbon footprint, water footprint, resource footprint and energy footprint. Not by a little, but by an exponential growth factor second to none. Therefore, immigration into the West creates a nightmare. What might that nightmare mean? It means the Third World keeps using the First World for a human exhaust vent. In the end, the West ultimately faces duplicating the Third World in overpopulation and resource usage. It wont be pretty folks. A reader responded to my last missive, Once again, someone claims that any focus on immigration to the United States is a meaningless distraction. In effect, he-she is saying that the annual addition of more than 30 million consumers to the third most populous and industrialized nation on earth is irrelevant. Moreover, since all nations and all global citizens will be subject to an energy contraction, building walls will not insulate us from that impact.  This stance is not credible. If energy deliveries will contract, it is ever more imperative to contract the number of consumers in America, or at the very least, prevent the US population from growing. Each additional American citizen will reduce the per capita share of non-renewable resources. We may not be able to solve the energy crisis, but surely we can't stand by and allow that crisis to be accelerated by an indifference to immigration growth.  He or she hopes to reduce population levels by a grassroots approach, by building a ""belief consensus"" for population reduction among target groups, like ""grandmothers"" who are not in the breeding phase of life. But how do you sell birth control to people who look around and see their own communities bulge with immigrants, legal and illegal? How do you tell the Smiths and the Jones' that they should not have children when the Sanchez family down the block is having five?  As one of my critics told me, governments are determined to grow the population by one means or another. If citizens choose not to birth children at a replacement level, then governments will import them. ""I prefer to have my own children than to outsource that job to immigrants"", she said. This is a natural reaction. If you don't reduce immigration, you can't convince people to remain childless in the interest of population control.  BTW, regarding target audiences. Have you ever met a grandmother or grandfather who wasn't absolutely delighted at the prospect of having a grandchild?  Let's get real. Controlling migration is the most efficient method of controlling or reducing population growth. ""But how does that affect population levels? he or she asked. The answer is that open borders are a proven fertility stimulant to those countries, which rely on massive emigration to relieve their population pressures and gain remittance money.

ESPN's ""Pardon the Interruption"" hosts Michael Wilbon and Tony Kornheiser blasted Stephen Curry and some of their fellow co-workers over Curry's recent comments about the moon-landing.

On Monday, Curry said on The Ringer's ""Winging It"" podcast that he doesn't think NASA landed on the moon. Fellow NBA players Andre Iguodala, Vince Carter, and Kent Bazemore, who were also featured on the podcast, agreed.

Though Curry didn't elaborate much further, the comments made the rounds, with NASA eventually inviting Curry to their facilities to see moon rocks.

On Tuesday's ""Pardon the Interruption,"" Wilbon criticized Curry, as well as the ESPN analyst Jalen Rose and the NBA reporter Marc J. Spears — both of whom apparently agreed with Curry — saying the comments are harmful and can lead to people questioning history.

""Don't do this. Don't come out and say, 'These pictures are kinda grainy. They're black and white. Happened before I was born,'"" Wilbon said. ""Because does that mean you don't believe in slavery? You don't believe in the Revolutionary War? ... Don't do this. You guys are too smart.""

This discovery, believed by some to be a joke or a conspiracy theory, has been circulating on social media in recent weeks after being formulated on Reddit in early 2017. Except it turns out not to be the only theory of its kind: through the years, online sleuths have found that all sorts of places don’t exist.

High on the list is Finland, the country some believe lies between Russia and Sweden, and that allegedly fought a valiant rearguard action against Soviet invasion in the runup to the second world war. This theory was also born on Reddit, in 2015. Finland, the user Raregan explained, was merely a fictional creation designed to create fishing quotas to aid the export of sushi to Japan from Russia.

Last summer, another Reddit user suggested the Italian region of Molise – population 300,000 – doesn’t exist, apparently as the result of an Italian in-joke, while Brazilians have had for at least five years an online theory that the north-western state of Acre doesn’t exist or else is a land that time forgot, still populated by dinosaurs.

The joke – or painstakingly well-evidenced and argued theory – that a country or region doesn’t exist turns out to be one of the oldest memes on the internet. As early as 1993, German users of Usenet – a network of online discussion forms (or bulletin boards), which predates the web – had a running joke that the Westfalian town of Bielefeld (population 300,000, funnily enough) was a fiction maintained by the CIA, Mossad, aliens or some combination of the three.

The joke has crossed decades, online platforms, language barriers and international cultures, and keeps coming back.“The beauty of memes is that they are malleable and everyone can have their own spin on things and get involved in the joke,” says writer Mollie Goodfellow. “I think it says that we all like to be in on the joke, especially online, where often different cliques and subgroups can form.”

In these days of fake news and mainstream-media conspiracies, though, it doesn’t do to take anything for granted – so G2 contacted a diplomatic source, who agreed to speak off the record and confirm what they could about the existence (or otherwise) of Finland and Australia.

746,"Social distancing and early testing could have PREVENTED 95% of all coronavirus cases in China

Authorities all over the world are encouraging social distancing as a means to stop the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Now, two separate studies show how the pandemic could have been slowed down when it broke out in China if social distancing practices were implemented earlier.

To see how governments can better respond to the pandemic, two separate studies have taken a look at how China initially handled it. Both indicate that the number of infections could have been much lower — by as much as 95 percent according to one of the studies — had the country implemented social distancing earlier as asymptomatic carriers pose a much more significant risk.

As the source of the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus responsible for the outbreak, it also has the largest number of confirmed cases at over 81,000 at the time of writing. In one of the studies, however, researchers estimated that the numbers could have been as high as 114,325 by the end of February.

Early detection and isolation more effective than travel restrictions

To take a closer look at how effective China’s containment strategy was and how it could have been better, a team at the University of Southampton in England built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infections-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. The model was then combined with historical and real-real-time human movement data from location-based services run by Chinese tech company Baidu.

Using the simulation, the team gauged the effectivity of the various non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies used by China, such as quarantines and social distancing. Here, the team figured that, without the NPIs, there would have been a 67 percent increase in the number of cases. However, the study also found that had China implemented these measures one, two or three weeks earlier, it could have reduced the number of infections 66, 86 and 95 percent, respectively. This is on top of reducing the number of areas affected by the outbreak.

What’s more interesting is that the researchers also looked at the effectivity of the individual NPIs. Of the various methods, it was early detection and isolation of cases that proved to be more effective. This finding is in line with what’s happening in China’s close neighbor South Korea, which has largely kept its outbreak under control, thanks to a massive testing spree but no travel lockdown.

That said, the team isn’t downplaying the effects of China’s lockdowns on its cities. The team stated that a strategy of coordinated NPIs has the strongest and most rapid containment of the outbreak.

“Our study demonstrates how important it is for countries which are facing an imminent outbreak to proactively plan a coordinated response which swiftly tackles the spread of the disease on a number of fronts,” added Dr. Shengjie Lai, a research fellow at the University of Southampton and one of the authors of the study.

The results of the study at the University of Southampton line up with those of another study recently published in the journal Science. This study focused on undocumented cases of COVID-19 in China and how they helped spread the infection before the authorities could contain it.

These undocumented cases consisted of people who either had only mild symptoms of the disease or no symptoms at all. According to researchers at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who conducted the study, these cases can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur.

To asses the full epidemic potential of the coronavirus, the team used a computer model to estimate the proportion and contagiousness of these undocumented cases during the weeks before and after China’s lockdown of the city of Wuhan. In this model, the spread of the coronavirus across cities was then simulated using the mobility data collected by Chinese form Tencent from January 10 to 23 and January 24 to February 8.

Using the numbers extrapolated from the model, the researchers at Columbia found that 86 percent of all infections were undocumented before travel in and out of Wuhan was shut down on January 23. The researchers say that these undocumented infections were more than half as contagious as documented infections. However, they were still the source for over two-thirds of the documented infections.

“The explosion of COVID-19 cases in China was largely driven by individuals with mild, limited, or no symptoms who went undetected,” stated co-author Jeffrey Shaman, professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University Mailman School.

“These stealth transmissions will continue to present a major challenge to the containment of this outbreak going forward,” Shaman added.

In late January, China implemented a number of measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus, including implementing lockdowns of cities such as Wuhan. The researchers acknowledged that these, alongside the public’s heightened awareness of the outbreak and increased use of personal protective measures, have helped slow the outbreak down.

Coronavirus could become endemic, and return like seasonal flu

Despite the measures implemented by China, the number of undocumented cases and their effectivity at spreading the virus has made the researchers question whether or not efforts by the Chinese government would be enough to contain the spread of the virus entirely. Shaman said that he felt it was unclear whether the reductions made by China’s efforts would be enough to fully stem the spread of the coronavirus.

He then likened the ongoing pandemic to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Also known as the “swine flu,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated this pandemic killed around 284,500 people. Shaman then stated that the COVID-19 pandemic, which has only killed 3,213 as of the time of writing, would end up following the pattern of the swine flu pandemic, which would make it the fifth endemic coronavirus in humans.

The four current endemic coronaviruses, including the two responsible for the 2003 to 2004 SARS outbreak, are currently responsible for an estimated one-quarter of all colds. If this new one does join them as the fifth, then COVID-19 could repeatedly return like the seasonal flu.

“This is going to be with us for some time – it’s endemic in human populations and not going to go away without a vaccine,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, earlier this month.

Adalja also warned that the early spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. could have been facilitated by it being mistaken as seasonal flu, resulting in people not getting tested. With the new studies then, the scientists are hoping that the mistakes in China aren’t continued in other countries and that the early, undocumented spread of the disease is arrested through early testing and social distancing. That, and if the coronavirus ever returns seasonally in the future, health officials are better prepared to deal with it.",conspiracy,C017dd,flat.earth

Irving first publicly spoke about flat-Earth theories during an appearance on a podcast in February 2017.

In the Road Trippin’ podcast, hosted by his teammates Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye, Irving said “the Earth is flat” three times, adding: “What I’ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that – can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what’s going on with these ‘planets’ and stuff like this?”

The 26-year-old later said his belief in the theory was formed by “watching a whole bunch of Instagram videos”, but told people to “do your own research”.",mainstream,M13a4c,flat.earth

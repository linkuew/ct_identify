903,"A carbon tax is paid by businesses and industries that produce carbon dioxide through their operations. The tax is designed to reduce the output of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide, a colorless and odorless incombustible gas, into the atmosphere. The tax is imposed with the goal of environmental protection.

A tax designed to mitigate or remove the negative externalities of carbon emission, a carbon tax is a type of Pigovian tax. Carbon is found in every kind of hydrocarbon fuel (including coal, petroleum, and natural gas) and is released as the harmful toxin carbon dioxide (CO ) when this kind of fuel is burned. CO is the compound primarily responsible for the ""greenhouse"" effect of trapping heat within the Earth's atmosphere, and is, therefore, one of the primary causes of global warming.

A carbon tax is also referred to as a form of carbon pricing on greenhouse gas emissions where a fixed price is set by the government for carbon emissions in certain sectors. The price is passed through from businesses to consumers. By increasing the cost of greenhouse emissions, governments hope to curb consumption, reduce the demand for fossil fuels, and push more companies toward creating environmentally-friendly substitutes. A carbon tax is a way for a state to exert some control over carbon emissions without resorting to the levers of a command economy, by which the state could control the means of production and manually halt carbon emissions.

Any carbon found in manufactured products like plastics that is not burned is not taxed. The same applies to any CO that is permanently isolated from production and is not released into the atmosphere. But the tax is paid during the upstream process, or when the fuel or gas is extracted from the Earth. Producers can then pass on the tax to the market by as much as they can. This, in turn, gives consumers a chance to reduce their own carbon footprints.

Carbon taxes have been implemented in a number of countries around the world. They take several different forms, but most amount to a straightforward rate of taxation per ton of hydrocarbon fuel used. The first country to implement a carbon tax was Finland, in 1990. That levy currently stands at $24.39 dollars per ton of carbon. The Finns were quickly followed by other Nordic countries — Sweden and Norway both implemented their own carbon taxes in 1991. Starting at a rate of $51 per ton of CO used in gasoline (the tax would later decrease considerably), the Norwegian tax is among the most stringent in the world.

Most forms of carbon taxation have been deployed successfully, but Australia's failed attempt from 2012-2014 stands in stark contrast. The minority Green party was able to broker the carbon tax during a period of political stagnation in 2011, but the tax never garnered the support of either of the main parties in Australia, the left-leaning Labor Party (which reluctantly agreed to the tax to form a government with the Greens) and the center-right Liberals, whose leader Tony Abbott spearheaded the 2014 repeal. Like most economic initiatives to combat climate change, carbon taxes remain highly controversial.",mainstream,M07e79,climate.change
921,"On the debate stage at Loyola Marymount University, Democrats described climate change as an existential threat — and said tackling it was a cause that could bring the country together.

The seven candidates all said they would be willing to relocate entire cities or individuals within cities who are threatened with climate-related disasters, in California due to fires or to floods in the Midwest.

The question hit home for debate viewers in this state, given the deadly wildfires of recent years, including the Camp fire that decimated the town of Paradise and killed 86 people in 2018.

Agreeing with the relocation idea, New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang said that “part of the plan is literally called move people to higher ground.”

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said her interest in helping people dealing with “unprecedented flooding” was personal. “It’s not flyover country to me. I live there,” she said.

The relocation discussion expanded to one about the need for the entire country to take the lead in addressing the issue and whether the next president would support alternative energy plans to wean the nation off fossil fuels, ones that include nuclear power.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren repeated her opposition to nuclear power but said the nation has to aggressively explore other clean-energy sources.

Yang said that as president, he’d put all options on the table, including nuclear energy use, to reduce the nation’s reliance on oil as a way to clean the air.

California billionaire Tom Steyer said he supports increasing the use of nuclear energy but also investing in wind, solar and battery power. He said addressing climate change would represent “the greatest opportunity to rebuild this country.”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said the narrowly focused question about relocation missed the mark. “The issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and grandchildren,” Sanders said.

• Don’t drink the bottled waters that contain dangerous microplastics

At the end of October, Tap launched an app that “displays nearby clean drinking water locations, from restaurants and retail stores to public water fountains, so you can refill your water bottle.”1

Brilliant. It’s like Apple or Google maps but for drinking water!

“The Tap app, available for free on Android and iOS, highlights 34,000 refill stations across 7,100 cities in 30 countries. The app provides profiles on each location and what it offers, such as flavored or sparkling water, and whether it comes free or at cost from a water cooler, counter service or a drinking fountain.”2
• ABC: Pepsi Admits That Its Aquafina Bottled Water Is Just Tap Water

Its creators hope that by making water easy to find (and likely free) that people will cut down on using plastic water bottles and instead, just refill the bottles (maybe even glass) that they already have. And, in the next couple of months, consumers might even see the blue “Tap” signs in store windows, signaling that the business is friendly to those looking to quest their thirst.
• NBC: Controversy after Nestle given new permit to bottle more Michigan water

This app is coming at the perfect time; also in October the UN Intergovernmental Panel released a climate change report that warned that global warming is on track to have a disastrous impact if nothing changes by 2030.

If people love Tap and really start to use it, its unclear how stores and restaurants will feel if they are bombarded by people looking for refills. Only time will tell.

538,"PRINCE HARRY met a Russian billionaire linked to his and Meghan's £11million Canada hideaway at a celebrity Google climate change retreat, it is reported.

The Duke of Sussex is said to have enjoyed a 'substantive chat' with businessman Yuri Milner at the three-day Google Camp gathering in Sicily last summer.

Mr Milner hosted a superyacht cocktail party for A-listers, who included Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Cruise, Orlando Bloom and Harry Styles, The Daily Mail reports.

It was reported at the time that Prince Harry gave a barefoot speech at the Google climate retreat but celebs were criticised for using gas-guzzling private jets and superyachts to get there.

Harry and Meghan are thought to have planned their bombshell retreat from frontline royal life at the stunning Mille Fleurs home on Vancouver Island.

But the royal couple have been at the heart of a secrecy row over who lent them the luxury mansion.

Harry and Meghan refused to say if they paid for their six-week stay or confirm who the property belongs to.

Moscow-born Mr Milner also rented Mille Fleurs five years ago, but denies he now owns the stunning pad.

But neighbours claim the holiday home is owned by a Russian billionaire.

Mr Milner's pal Canadian music producer David Foster also has a home on Vancouver Island.

The Sun previously revealed Harry and Meghan asked neighbours to sign non-disclosure agreements before moving in for Christmas with baby Archie.

The Mille Fleurs home near Victoria, British Columbia, would have cost more than £100,000 to rent.

The idyllic bolthole has stunning views and boasts eight bedrooms and two private beaches.

One local, who did not wish to be named, told The Sun: “I was very surprised to hear they were staying there because it’s always been a mystery about who actually owns it.

""It doesn’t seem the sort of place a royal couple would go.”

The mystery over the property’s ownership is likely to raise concerns over the couple’s acquaintances as they seek “financial independence”.

An estate agent who helped sell it in 2014 said the new owner included a non-disclosure agreement as part of the deal.

He said the buyer was neither Canadian nor American.

The complex purchasing method can help people hide their involvement.

All of the 27 properties on the road are registered under a company called Towner Bay Country Club.

It means buyers effectively just purchase shares in the club, with their names not on any public paperwork.

Mr Milner made a fortune when his investment firm DST Global bought stakes in Facebook and Twitter with funding said to be from Kremlin-controlled companies.

He has also invested in a real estate venture co-owned by Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

When asked about Mille Fleurs, Mr Milner's spokesman Paddy Harverson told the Mail: ""Neither Yuri Milner nor any family member nor any entity affiliated with him or his family owns this property.

""He rented the property five years ago for a brief period of time.""

192,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change asked scientists to come up with a figure of how temperature trends have risen over the last 10,000 years for the next annual report; however this task has proven quite difficult.

Zhengyu Liu, professor of atmospheric and ocean sciences at the University of Wisconsin, explains:

“Data from observation suggests that the Earth is cooling while the physical data suggests the complete opposite.”

Liu has been working with professors from many other academias to understand the obvious cooling of the planet:

The issue has been termed the Holocene Temperature Conundrum (HTC) which is explained:

“A recent temperature reconstruction of global annual temperature shows Early Holocene warmth followed by a cooling trend through the Middle to Late Holocene [Marcott SA, et al., 2013, Science 339(6124):1198–1201]. “This global cooling is puzzling because it is opposite from the expected and simulated global warming trend due to the retreating ice sheets and rising atmospheric greenhouse gases. “Our critical reexamination of this contradiction between the reconstructed cooling and the simulated warming points to potentially significant biases in both the seasonality of the proxy reconstruction and the climate sensitivity of current climate models.”

“Over the last 10,000 years, Liu says, we know atmospheric carbon dioxide rose by 20 parts per million before the 20th century, and the massive ice sheet of the Last Glacial Maximum has been retreating. “These physical changes suggest that, globally, the annual mean global temperature should have continued to warm, even as regions of the world experienced cooling, such as during the Little Ice Age in Europe between the 16th and 19th centuries.”

The myth perpetuated by alarmist scientists is that there is a 97% consensus that man-made climate change is real and that the Earth is heating up.

However, John Cook, climate scientist for the UQ Global Change Institute (GCI), released data from the University of Queensland (UQ) that shows “that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on [anthropogenic global warming] is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.”

Alastair McEwan, acting pro-vice-chancellor of UQ defended the college’s claim that there is a scientific consensus, independently of Cook’s findings:

To discredit Cook, a study was released in 2013 by climatologists that claimed Cook “misrepresented the views of most consensus scientists.”

This shows that the consensus that humans are the sole cause of climate change is actually only 0.3%. David Legates, geology professor for the University of Delaware commented:",conspiracy,C007bc,climate.change
893,"Tonsillitis (pronounced: tahn-suh-LYE-tus) is an infection of the tonsils caused by viruses or some types of bacteria.

Tonsils are lumps of tissue on both sides of the back of the throat that help the immune system protect the body from infections. But sometimes infections are too much for the tonsils to handle, and these fighters of infection become infected themselves.

Infected tonsils get swollen and red, and have a yellow or white coating. A person with tonsillitis may have a sore throat, fever, swollen glands in the neck, and trouble swallowing.

What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Tonsillitis?

Inflamed tonsils look red and swollen, and may be covered with a yellow or whitish coating or spots. Someone with tonsillitis may have:
• a sore throat, which can be mild to severe
• white spots or pus on the tonsils

If you have symptoms of tonsillitis, call your doctor.

Tonsillitis is usually caused by a

Bacteria also can cause it, most commonly group A streptococcus (strep throat). Rarely, tonsillitis can be caused by something other than an infection.

Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your throat and neck. Your doctor may use a soft cotton swab to gently collect a sample from your tonsils and the back of your throat for testing.

It's important for your doctor to know if

are causing the infection. If you have strep throat, you'll need treatment withto kill the bacteria. This will help you feel better and prevent other problems that can come from untreated strep throat.

If your doctor prescribes antibiotics, be sure to follow the directions carefully. Finish taking all the medicine even if your symptoms go away and you feel better, or the infection could come back.

If a strep test comes back negative, it's probably a virus causing the tonsillitis and antibiotics won't help. Just like with a cold (also caused by a virus), you'll have to take it easy for several days and let the virus run its course.

Rarely, if someone gets tonsillitis a lot, the doctor or an otolaryngologist (pronounced: oh-toe-lar-un-GA-luh-jist, a doctor who specializes in ear, nose, and throat problems) may recommend a tonsillectomy (pronounced: tahn-suh-LEK-tuh-mee). This is a surgery to remove the tonsils. Tonsillectomy used to be a common procedure, but now experts recommend watching and waiting because large tonsils often shrink on their own over time.

How Can I Feel Better?

Get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. You can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve any pain or discomfort. (Don't take aspirin or other products that contain aspirin, though, because these may put you at risk of developing Reye syndrome, an illness that can have serious complications.)

Avoid smoking or anything that will irritate your throat. It's best to drink lots of liquids. You may prefer softer foods, like applesauce, flavored gelatin, or ice cream. If you don't feel like eating, try drinking liquids that contain calories, such as fruit juices, milkshakes, and soups and broths.

If you're on antibiotics, it's usually OK to return to school 24 hours after you start taking them if your fever is gone and you feel better. If you're still feeling weak, tired, or achy, it may be best to stay home for another day or two.

Tonsillitis is contagious. This means you can get it from someone else who has it. Sneezing and coughing can pass the tonsillitis-causing virus or bacteria from one person to the next.

To protect yourself from catching tonsillitis or to prevent passing it to somebody else:
• Wash your hands well and often.
• If someone in your household or a friend has tonsillitis, don't use that person's cups, glasses, silverware, toothbrush, or other utensils. And if you have tonsillitis, keep your stuff separate and don't share it with anyone.
• Don't kiss anyone until you're completely over the tonsillitis.
• Get a new toothbrush after you feel better and are no longer contagious.

When Should I Call the Doctor?

Call your doctor right away if your condition gets worse; for example, if you have a hard time breathing or swallowing. Also talk to your doctor if your fever comes back or if you're not feeling better in a couple of days.",mainstream,M0d3c7,climate.change
427,"Can the Weather Affect My Child's Asthma?

Yes. Weather conditions can bring on asthma symptoms. Some kids' asthma symptoms get worse at certain times of the year. For others, a severe storm or sudden weather change can trigger a flare-up.

Cold, dry air is a common asthma trigger and can cause bad flare-ups. That's especially true for people who play winter sports and have exercise-induced asthma.

Hot, humid air also can be a problem. In some places, heat and sunlight combine with pollutants to create ground-level ozone. This kind of ozone can be a strong asthma trigger.

Wet weather and windy weather can cause problems too. Wet weather encourages mold growth, and wind can blow mold and pollen through the air.

If you think weather plays a role in your child's asthma, keep a diary of asthma symptoms and possible triggers and discuss them with your doctor. If pollen, mold, or other allergens make asthma symptoms worse, ask about allergy testing.

How Can We Avoid Weather Triggers?

Once you know what kind of weather triggers asthma symptoms, try these tips to protect your child:
• Watch the forecast for pollen and mold counts plus other conditions (extreme cold or heat) that might affect your child's asthma.
• Make sure your child wears a scarf over the mouth and nose when outside in very cold weather.
• Keep windows closed at night to keep pollen and molds out. If it's hot, use air conditioning, which cleans, cools, and dries the air.
• Keep your child indoors early in the morning (before 10 a.m.) when pollen is at its highest.
• Your child shouldn't mow the lawn or rake leaves, and should be kept away from freshly cut grass and leaf piles.
• Dry clothes in the dryer (hanging clothes or sheets to dry can allow mold or pollen to collect on them).
• Make sure your child always has quick-relief medicine (also called rescue or fast-acting medicine) on hand.

Your child's written asthma action plan should list weather triggers and ways to manage them, including any seasonal changes in medicine.",mainstream,M0b8fc,climate.change
591,"Coronavirus won't be the last outbreak. Climate change, waning habitat will drive disease

Researchers aren't clear yet about how the novel coronavirus began infecting people, but say it seems to have originated in bats, making it the latest in a string of emerging human disease that spread from animals.

Disease and wildlife experts say they expect to see a rise in diseases transmitted among animals, plants and humans, and in particular, more frequent outbreaks in humans of diseases that come from animals. Such ""zoonotic"" diseases already make up the majority of new infections in humans.

But animals aren't to blame for the increase in new outbreaks, according to Arizona State University virologist Arvind Varsani. Humans are.

Varsani researches the emergence of diseases around the globe and he said two major factors likely to impact the dynamics of virus spread are climate change and changes in land use due to urbanization or agriculture.

Both factors put animals under strain, forcing them to compete for resources in shrinking habitats and making them opportune hosts for zoonotic diseases, which more easily infect stressed animals. Shrinking suitable habitat amid urbanization and the rapid expansion of agriculture also cluster animals closer together with humans and domestic animals. That allows the viruses to jump from one host to the next.

“You stress these animals and that means you’re creating an environment for viruses to succeed, where in most cases the viruses would’ve been put to check,"" he said. ""And with that, everyone is in very, very close proximity to each other, so what you’ve got is one event — and you only need one event to take off — and the next thing you know, it's spilling over.”

And sometimes, the viruses spill over into humans.

According to a 2016 report from the United Nations Environment Programme, around 60 percent of all infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic, as well as 75 percent of all emerging infectious diseases. Researchers also detected an increase in the rate of new, emerging infectious diseases, according to the report.

In the case of the novel coronavirus, the source is believed to be a market in Wuhan, China, that sold both dead and live animals. Arizona Game and Fish wildlife veterinarian Anne Justice-Allen said that veterinarians and disease experts strongly recommend against having markets like these, which can be densely packed, difficult to keep clean, and pose a higher risk of viruses jumping from animals into humans.

She said the current COVID-19 outbreak is an example of how human actions to mix together animals that weren't normally together can cause diseases to jump into new hosts.

""The more we increase the interaction between people and animals, especially wildlife and especially livestock as well, or animals that are raised for food, the more likely we are to see that kind of situation crop up,"" she said.

The COVID-19 outbreak is an example of the risk zoonotic diseases pose. Other well-known examples of zoonotic diseases that impact humans are West Nile Virus, HIV, Ebola, Zika, bird flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, Rift Valley fever, and sudden acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. On average, one new infectious disease emerges in humans every four months, according to the UNEP report, but not all are this severe.

“While it is very uncommon for diseases in animals to suddenly jump and become so transmissible between people as this one did, the more we do that sort of thing, mixing animals together ... then the more likely that disease is going to be able to jump into people and become transmissible between people,"" Justice-Allen said.

With climate change effects such as drought, increasing temperatures and wildfires, Justice-Allen said animals will be forced to move to new areas. That would lead to the same type of crowding and mixing seen in live animal markets and possibly expose animals to new diseases.

FIGHTING CORONAVIRUS: Using robots to speed up testing, ASU hopes to open drive-thru coronavirus testing

Warming global temperatures are increasing the habitat ranges of some insects that transmit diseases from one organism to another, such as mosquitoes or ticks. Warming is also lengthening the season in which these insects can survive in some areas, leading to a boom in their population. In certain areas, these insects, also known as disease vectors, are now able to survive year-round where they weren't able to before.

The increased range and abundance of vectors could lead to more widespread cases of mosquito- and tick-borne diseases such as malaria, West Nile Virus, dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, and Lyme disease, according to Heidi Brown, an ASU researcher who studies vector-borne diseases.

Brown is one of the researchers who works with the Arizona Department of Health Services on a Building Resilience Against Climate Effects plan, which investigates the impacts of climate change on human health, projects future scenarios and suggests solutions to mitigate those effects. Arizona is one of 16 state grant recipients creating a BRACE plan as part of the CDC's Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative.

""We have to be prepared for the known, which is increases in the stuff that we're already seeing, but we also have to be prepared for the unknown, which is novel introductions,"" she said.

In Arizona, known diseases such as West Nile Virus are likely to become a bigger concern, and may spread into new areas of the state outside of Maricopa County, Brown said.

""Flagstaff doesn't typically think about or worry too much about West Nile Virus, and we don't usually have a lot of cases up there, but there's evidence that suggests that we might need to start making sure that we're watching for it,"" she said.

Arizona is also worried about other mosquito-born diseases like chikungunya and dengue fever, which aren't currently part of Arizona's ecosystem but could become permanently established in the future.

Factors like drought can also cause vectors to cluster around water sources alongside of animals, leading to further mixing and further possibilities for new diseases spread in vectors.

Another bridge between humans and animal diseases is domestic animals, according to Bernard Bett, a scientist at International Livestock Research Institute.

Around the world, Bett said agriculture is increasingly encroaching on wild lands, bringing humans and domestic animals closer to wild ones and disturbing the natural ecosystem. But domestic animals have been bred in such a way that they lack the genetic diversity needed for disease resilience and can then pass the infection on to humans.

One example is the bird flu, which moved from wild birds into domestic poultry before being passed to humans.

Demand for milk and meat ""driven mainly by fast-growing populations of urban consumers in developing countries,"" is projected to double by 2050, according to the UNEP report, meaning that the problem is likely to get worse as agricultural demand expands.

Urbanization also can encroach on wild lands, Varsani said, and that means humans are coming into increased contact with animals — creating another potential avenue for disease transmission.

Increased zoonotic disease spread could also have devastating effects on animals, especially those already at risk from other climate change effects.

“We have a number of endangered species here in Arizona which are kind of on the edge when it comes to being able to respond to new stressors,"" Justice-Allen said.

One is the Mount Graham red squirrel, whose habitat was severely damaged by a wildfire in 2017. While the population seems to be recovering, Justice-Allen said, ""another stressor might tip them over the edge.""

Other populations on the brink include the California condor, the black-footed ferret, and Arizona's indigenous snakes and amphibians such as frogs. Some are already being challenged by disease.

Black-footed ferrets feed on prairie dogs, but the plague, spread by fleas, can wipe out entire colonies of prairie dogs, decimating the ferrets' food supply. This disease isn't native to North America, currently has a small incident rate in humans and is curable in most cases. But cases of plague could surge in coming years due to climate change, according to Justice-Allen.

""The dynamics of plague outbreaks is changing, or will change,"" she said. ""This spring is setting us up for a pretty significant plague outbreak.""

Arizona's frogs and other amphibians are battling a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis, which was first seen in Africa and interferes with the ability of their skin to absorb moisture.

These diseases, along with mosquito- and tick-borne diseases, are just a few known diseases that Arizona experts are monitoring. But there's always the possibility for unknowns — for new diseases to show up unexpectedly — especially in tight living conditions.

In more clustered spaces, Varsani said there's a greater chance for an animal to become infected with two different diseases at the same time, opening the possibility for the birth of chimeras, or mash-ups, of two different, related viruses.

If two viruses are infecting the same cell, when those viruses replicate, they can combine into a new hybrid virus that could jump into new animals that were previously unaffected.

""You mix components and what you’re then doing is you’re allowing for these viral genomes to evolve very rapidly and adapt to a new host,"" he said.

Varsani also works to find and study unknown viruses in remote areas, such as the polar regions. He has traveled to Antarctica nearly every year since he first visited about seven years ago, and said viruses he studies there may have been around for a while, but were only discovered recently.

One example is a circovirus that has only recently been noticed in penguins and that causes lethal feather loss.

Viruses in the polar regions are just as abundant as they are in other parts of the world, he said, and since the polar regions are expected to see some of the most dramatic changes due to climate change, these regions and their viruses are crucial to understand for the future.

As seen with the COVID-19 outbreak, vaccines for new diseases take time to develop, as do tests to screen for them.

Arizona and other states have come up with plans to deal with increased outbreaks and have vector-control measures in place, but Brown acknowledged that it can be hard to prepare for new emerging diseases.

""It's a long process to be able to come up with tests and identify new pathogens, especially when they're not the ones you're used to looking for.”

The Arizona Game and Fish Department monitors for new disease emergences by surveilling animal populations and investigating animal deaths to ensure that the cause of death wasn't an unknown disease, according to Justice-Allen.

Bett said health care officials can take other measures to ensure that there is a structured, strong health system in place with contingency plans for disease outbreaks and centers where patients can be isolated or receive supportive treatment.

“I wonder to what extent the U.S. anticipated this spread. If you have good anticipation, that’s a good first line of defense,"" Bett said.

Even with further study of climate effects on disease, there can be unpredicted challenges in trying to anticipate and address new diseases, said Ben Beard, the deputy director of the CDC’s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases in Fort Collins, Colorado.

""While long term trends in climate change can be modeled, specific weather events or disasters such as hurricanes, floods, or fires are very difficult to predict and may have a big impact on disease outbreaks,"" he wrote in an email to The Republic.

To prepare and respond to future outbreaks, he said, a strong public health framework that prioritizes public health surveillance, state and local preparedness, and long-term research would be necessary.

In addition to being more conscious of how people affect the environment and existing ecosystems, Varsani said identifying and understanding the viruses present in the world currently can help society better prepare to control them. This is no small feat, considering that viruses are among the most abundant entities on the planet.

""Viruses are understudied,"" he said. “We have no idea what the next entity will be, nobody expected this outbreak to take place and it's now consumed most of the world in a very short period.”

948,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its 2019 Arctic Report Card on Tuesday, and folks, the results aren’t great.

The report details a rapidly changing Arctic environment featuring melting ice, a greener landscape, and, alarmingly, greenhouse-gas emissions on par with some large nations. The Arctic could be releasing upwards of 600 million tons of net carbon per year, the report finds, potentially putting the region alongside Mexico, Canada, and South Korea as one of the world’s largest contributors to atmospheric CO2. Though the carbon emitted from such industrialized nations is the result of burning fossil fuels, the hundreds of millions of metric tons pumping out of the Arctic is the result of thawing permafrost.

Permafrost being permafrost, it takes more than the seasons changing for it to actually melt it. The increasingly rapid thawing of frozen Arctic earth is the result of climate change, and the NOAA’s report card reveals that temperatures are continuing to rise in the world’s nether-regions, which aren’t as icy as they used to be. In August, for instance, the average sea surface temperatures in several highlighted Arctic bodies of water were 1-7 degrees Celsius warmer than the average from 1982-2010. Just as frightening: the average land surface temperature north of 60 degrees N was the second-warmest since 1900.

It’s not just permafrost that rising temperatures are affecting. The report also found:
• None The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing 267 billion metric tons of ice per year.
• None Two of the five lowest months for North American Arctic snow cover in the 53 years records have been kept occurred this summer.
• None Sea ice extent this summer was tied for the second-lowest since satellite imagery recorded coverage in 1979. Sea ice extent in the winter was also second-lowest, narrowly falling short of the lowest-ever total, which occurred in…2018.

These changes are threatening indigenous Arctic communities and Arctic wildlife directly, as well as the rest of the world, on a profound scale. The deteriorating Greenland Ice Sheet is causing the global sea level to rise 0.7 millimeters per year, and Arctic carbon emissions are helping cook the planet at a rate that will soon be irreversible unless dramatic steps are taken.

The need for urgent action was stressed Wednesday by teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who spoke to delegates at a United Nations climate summit in Madrid. “Our leaders are not behaving as though we were in an emergency,” said Thunberg, who the same day was named Time magazine’s Person of Year. “If there’s a child standing in the middle of the road and cars are coming at full speed, you don’t look away because it is too uncomfortable. You immediately run out and rescue that child. And without that sense of urgency, how can we, the people, understand that we are facing a real crisis.”

Some governing bodies are at least trying. The European Commission on Wednesday revealed plans for a European Green Deal that would reimagine the continent’s economy in accordance with the climate crisis.

Meanwhile, the president of the world’s second-largest carbon emitter is dismantling efforts to fight the problem and struggling to even feign concern. “Climate change is very important to me,” President Trump managed last week in London despite his penchant for slashing environmental regulations. “I’ve done many environmental impact statements over my life and I believe very strongly in very, very crystal clear, clean water and clean air. That’s a big part of climate change.”

941,"he historical record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, claimed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the justification for greenhouse gas reduction, is a fraud. Research by a Freiburg, Germany professor, Ernst-Georg Beck of the Merian-Schule, shows that the IPCC construed and concocted the pre-1957 CO2 record from measurements on recently drilled ice cores, ignoring more than 0,000 direct measurements by chemical methods from 1857 to 1957.1 

 

 The IPCC’s hoked-up record attempts to prove that CO2 concentrations have been steadily increasing with the progress of human industrial civilization. Beck’s work confirms a wealth of previous investigations which demonstrate that the IPCC cherry-picked its data in an attempt to prove that we must stop industrial development and return to the horse-andbuggy age, or face oppressive heat and melting of the polar ice caps. It shows that the Kyoto Treaty on reduction of greenhouse gases was based on a scientific fraud which violates the laws of the universe, denying the well-established determination of climate by cyclical variations in the Earth-Sun orbital relationship and in the Sun’s heat output.

43,"The Covid-19 lockdown has cut climate change emissions - for now. But some governments want to go further by harnessing their economic recovery plans to boost low-carbon industries. Their slogan is ""Build Back Better"", but can they succeed?

I've just had a light bulb moment. The feisty little wren chirping loudly in the matted ivy outside my back door is telling us something important about global climate change.

That's because, intertwined with the melodious notes of a robin, I can actually hear its song clearly.

Normally, both birds are muffled by the insistent rumble of traffic, but the din has been all but extinguished in the peace of lockdown.

The drop in traffic is a major contributor to the fall in planet-warming CO2 emissions we've witnessed globally.

Before the Covid-19 crisis, we accepted the dominance of traffic noise as an inevitable consequence of city living.

Now, we have sampled an alternative urban ambience.

Governments currently face a stark choice: bail out polluting businesses, using that as leverage to impose environmentally-minded reforms, or let them return to their carbon-intensive activities as an economic quick fix.

But many members of the public have little desire to return to the state of affairs before lockdown.

In a poll, a fifth of members of the motoring group the AA, said they would work more from home in future.

This has implications for the UK government's £28bn road-building programme which assumes that traffic will rise by 1% per year - a conjecture that now looks unlikely.

The stay-at-home trend will be offset somewhat by nervous public transport users shunning trains for fear of infection, and by long-distance commuters who might decide that if they only need to visit the office three days a week, they'll buy a home even further away.

The AA, which for years was seen as the voice of motorists, has asked the government to think again about its £28bn road expansion. Its president, Edmund King, has suggested the money would be better spent on improving broadband

Another likely winner from the crisis is the movement fighting to turn city streets over to pedestrians and cyclists.

This has already happened in places like Paris, which is rolling out 650km of ""corona cycle-ways"", and Milan, which has a programme to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists.

The determination to seize the moment for environmental change stretches further than the transport sector.

The UK is one of several nations looking to reboot its environmental strategy by calling in favours from private industry. After all, it was government which bailed out employers when the crunch came in March. The catchphrase is ""Build Back Better"".

But it would seem to face a direct challenge in the shape of China and the US. The economies of both these superpowers have been savaged by the effects of coronavirus.

They are desperate to get back to pre-virus levels of output, so their leaders may think the surest means of doing so is through tried and trusted climate warming fossil fuels.

For those seeking a greener way out of the Covid-19 slump, renewable energy will help, along with electric vehicle charging points and broadband.

Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, is on the same track. He is leading work on a Green Deal to make the EU's economy sustainable and says that not a single Euro should be spent propping up old, dirty industries.

All Covid-19 recovery investment should go towards commerce that either helps reduce carbon emissions or promotes digital business, he insists.

But some MEPs from parties on the right warn that the pandemic will have ""far-reaching"" economic and social consequences.

They insist the EU must scale back its pre-crisis climate ambitions.

That's led some governments, like Germany and the UK, to offer hand-outs to polluting industries without imposing green conditions.

In the UK, the issue is causing contortions among politicians torn between saving existing jobs and conserving the planet.

MPs from the Liberal Democrats - thought of as one of the ""greenest"" UK parties - have joined other parliamentarians in demanding a conditional rescue for the airline industry.

They say that if ministers don't step in, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost.

But the firms should promise to off-set their emissions by, for example, planting trees.

Off-setting is hugely contentious. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, argues: ""Any government bailout should focus on workers, not the industry itself.

""It should be conditional on the industry agreeing to shrink until - if ever - low-carbon technology is available - which isn't now.""

That begs a question: which industries should qualify for support? Should cash go exclusively to self-evidently green sectors like solar power - or to dirty firms trying to clean up?

Take the fossil fuel firms that pay our pension dividends by drilling for the stuff that's over-heating the world.

The UK's oil and gas industry warns that 30,000 jobs could be lost because of the pandemic and the current low oil price.

But why would governments support a commodity that's fuelling the climate crisis, which is judged by the UN to be deeper than the Covid-19 crisis?

Perhaps it's not that simple. Lord Stern, the former Treasury chief who's now a climate expert, told me each firm should be judged on its trajectory, not on its current state.

""The oil and gas industries are producing stuff you want to run down very quickly,"" he said. ""But you do see some companies - like BP and Shell - which are declaring they are moving in a direction where they want to be going zero carbon.

""So, you can't be indiscriminate or dogmatic. You have to look where the industry is going.""

At least UK environmentalists are dealing with firms that agree on the need to tackle climate change.

In the US, some fossil fuel firms have been determined to pursue government bail-outs without strings binding them to a less polluting future.

The Democratic Party has a long-standing proposal for a ""Green New Deal"" to promote clean technology. But President Donald Trump has minimised the importance of climate change. He has promised to help struggling fossil fuel firms, although his efforts have not taken root in a major way.

Then there's China. In 2015, its leaders were persuaded by President Barack Obama to make major climate change commitments as part of the Paris climate agreement.

Since then, China has suffered job losses and fuel shortages. Beijing has resorted to a quick fix for the economy by building coal-fired power plants.

The green think tank Global Energy Monitor says the number of plants China approved in the first three weeks of March 2020 - equivalent to 7,960 megawatts (MW) - was more than the number agreed in the whole of 2019 (6,310 MW).
• A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?
• AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise
• TESTING: Can I get tested for coronavirus?

That doesn't take into account China's estimated $1 trillion investment in its ""Belt and Road"" initiative to build huge, carbon-intensive infrastructure projects across developing countries.

Unless China and President Trump change their spots (or the Democratic candidate wins the US election), Europe's Build Back Better campaign won't be enough to protect the increasingly fragile climate, even if it does engineer a green recovery.

And we have a lesson from history. Nick Robins from the London School of Economics (LSE) estimates that in the global financial crisis of 2008 just 16% of global stimulus plans were green - mainly because China invested massively in fossil fuel projects.

He tells me: ""If we have any hope of combating climate change, we must make absolutely sure we do it better this time.""

885,"Ben Franklin once intoned that ""Beer is living proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy."" If Ben were alive today, he, and perhaps God himself, would be crying in his suds at the news coming out of the University of California, Irvine (UCI). It seems that if human-induced global warming continues on its current trajectory, the world's beer supply will dry up.

You read that right: If human-induced global warming continues on its current trajectory, the world's beer supply will dry up. Forget the other aspects of global warming: devastating and more frequent hurricanes; hotter-than-normal summers; longer droughts; wildfires; rising sea levels. We could run out of beer, people!

Researchers, in a study published Oct. 15, 2018, in the journal Nature Plants, ran the numbers and concluded that excessive and prolonged heat waves and droughts will ravage the world's barley supply. As any imbiber of beer will tell you, barley is the main ingredient in any good pint. As these fields of taste and wonder disappear, the laws of supply and demand will muscle in. Beer prices will surge, which means only the well-heeled will be able to afford a frosty mug of brew. No trickle-down economics here. The hoi polis — you, me and our friends — will be left high and dry. Ireland could see a 193 percent price increase, depending on the severity of conditions.

""The world is facing many life-threatening impacts of climate change, so people having to spend a bit more to drink beer may seem trivial by comparison,"" co-author Steven Davis, UCI associate professor of Earth system science said in a statement. ""But there is definitely a cross-cultural appeal to beer, and not having a cool pint at the end of an increasingly common hot day just adds insult to injury.""

Davis and his colleagues looked at how much fossil fuels humans are currently burning, and what they will burn in the future. They also looked at the levels of carbon dioxide emissions — the main greenhouse gas. If their models are accurate, the regions of the world where barley grows, especially the prairies of Canada, the northern Great Plains of the United States, and parts of Europe, Asia and Australia, will get hotter and drier, causing crop yields to decline 3 to 17 percent. Even modest warming will lead to more drought and heat in these areas, the scientists say.

As a result, beer prices will go up in beer-loving countries, including Belgium, Canada, Denmark and Poland. If you love spending time chugging in Ireland, you will need an extra $20 to buy a six-pack. Moreover, people in poorer countries will see beer consumption go down. Argentina, the researchers said, will see a 32 percent decrease in beer drinking. As for the United States, you'll see less keggers and beer pong, not to mention the occasional funnel.

""Our results show that in the most severe climate events, the supply of beer could decline by about 16 percent in years when droughts and heat waves strike,"" Davis said. ""That's comparable to all beer consumption in the U.S. Future climate and pricing conditions could put beer out of reach for hundreds of millions of people around the world.""

1248,"The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2018 was 407.4 parts per million (ppm for short), with a range of uncertainty of plus or minus 0.1 ppm. Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least the past 800,000 years.

In fact, the last time the atmospheric CO amounts were this high was more than 3 million years ago, when temperature was 2°–3°C (3.6°–5.4°F) higher than during the pre-industrial era, and sea level was 15–25 meters (50–80 feet) higher than today.

Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years.

Squeeze or stretch the graph in either direction by holding the Shift key while you click and drag. The bright red line (source data) shows monthly average carbon dioxide at NOAA's Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawai'i in parts per million (ppm): the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. Over the course of the year, values are higher in Northern Hemisphere winter and lower in summer. The dark red line shows the annual trend, calculated as a 12-month rolling average.

According to the State of the Climate in 2018 report from NOAA and the American Meteorological Society, global atmospheric carbon dioxide was 407.4 ± 0.1 ppm in 2018, a new record high. That is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2017, similar to the increase of 2.2 ± 0.1 ppm between 2016 and 2017.

In the 1960s, the global growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per year. Over the past decade, however, the growth rate has been closer to 2.3 ppm per year. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.

Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Warmed by sunlight, Earth’s land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared energy (heat). Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb that heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out. Without this natural greenhouse effect, Earth’s average annual temperature would be below freezing instead of close to 60°F. But increases in greenhouse gases have tipped the Earth's energy budget out of balance, trapping additional heat and raising Earth's average temperature.

Carbon dioxide is the most important of Earth’s long-lived greenhouse gases. It absorbs less heat per molecule than the greenhouse gases methane or nitrous oxide, but it’s more abundant and it stays in the atmosphere much longer. And while carbon dioxide is less abundant and less powerful than water vapor on a molecule per molecule basis, it absorbs wavelengths of thermal energy that water vapor does not, which means it adds to the greenhouse effect in a unique way. Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide are responsible for about two-thirds of the total energy imbalance that is causing Earth's temperature to rise.

Another reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification.

A drop of 0.1 may not seem like a lot, but the pH scale is logarithmic; a 1-unit drop in pH means a tenfold increase in acidity. A change of 0.1 means a roughly 30% increase in acidity. Increasing acidity interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from the water to build their shells and skeletons.

Natural increases in carbon dioxide concentrations have periodically warmed Earth’s temperature during ice age cycles over the past million years or more. The warm episodes (interglacials) began with a small increase in sunlight due to a tiny wobble in Earth’s axis of rotation or in the path of its orbit around the Sun.

That little bit of extra sunlight caused a little bit of warming. As the oceans warmed, they outgassed carbon dioxide—like a can of soda going flat in the heat of a summer day. The extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere amplified the initial warming.

Based on air bubbles trapped in mile-thick ice cores (and other paleoclimate evidence), we know that during the ice age cycles of the past million years or so, carbon dioxide never exceeded 300 ppm. Before the Industrial Revolution started in the mid-1700s, the global average amount of carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm.

By the time continuous observations began at Mauna Loa Volcanic Observatory in 1958, global atmospheric carbon dioxide was already 315 ppm. On May 9, 2013, the daily average carbon dioxide measured at Mauna Loa surpassed 400 ppm for the first time on record. Less than two years later, in 2015, the global amount went over 400 ppm for the first time. If global energy demand continues to grow and to be met mostly with fossil fuels, atmospheric carbon dioxide is projected to exceed 900 ppm by the end of this century.

712,"Melbourne, 25 June 2012: Australian infectious disease therapy and vaccine development company BioDiem Ltd (ASX: BDM) announced today the signing of a licensing agreement with Australian National University (ANU). This agreement is for an exclusive global license to commercialise a novel vaccine technology from the John

 Curtin School of Medical Research at ANU. Dengue Fever is the lead indication, but the technology may also facilitate the design of vaccines against a number of other infectious diseases including Murray River encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis. The increasing incidence of mosquito-borne disease is a major health concern worldwide as climate change expands the range of the carrier mosquitoes, exposing larger human populations.

The agreement includes provision for BioDiem to sublicense the technology. Industry standard royalties apply, but apart from a small contribution towards patent registration costs there is no up-front outlay for BioDiem. The agreement follows the signing of a term sheet announced to the ASX on 6 June 2012. Dengue Fever is a disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus that affects between 50 and 100 million people a year, and according to the World Health Organization the incidence is increasing significantly. Although only a

 small percentage of cases are fatal, non-fatal cases can be extremely debilitating. Dengue Fever currently has no existing vaccine, and control methods currently include attempts to address mosquito populations with varying effectiveness.

The technology is complementary to the BioDiem portfolio as well as the company's strategic focus on vaccines and therapies for infectious diseases and related cancers.

""We are delighted to announce the completion of this licensing agreement, which sees BioDiem's commercial expertise in the area of vaccines fittingly partnered with the exciting research developed by ANU. Our focus on infectious diseases is an excellent fit for this new technology which has strong potential as an asset for outlicensing"" said BioDiem CEO Julie Phillips. BioDiem's current strategy for the ANU technology includes leveraging the company's global partnering network to deliver an outlicensing partner for development of the technology, providing an opportunity to secure a royalties stream without significant development costs on the part of BioDiem.

BioDiem is an ASX-listed company based in Melbourne with an international focus on discovering, developing and commercialising world-class research and technology targeting cancers and infectious diseases. BioDiem's core technologies include the Live Attenuated Influenza Virus (LAIV), the SAVINE platform and the BDM-I

 antimicrobial compound. The LAIV influenza vaccine is an intranasal vaccine to prevent infection from seasonal and pandemic influenza. The LAIV influenza vaccine can be produced using both egg-based and cell-based manufacturing methods. The cell-based LAIV vaccine has completed a Phase II clinical trial in Europe. The egg-based LAIV vaccine

 technology is licensed to the World Health Organization as part of the Global Pandemic Influenza Action Plan to Increase Vaccine Supply. The LAIV influenza vaccine is marketed as Nasovac™ in India by the Serum Institute of India, and has been licensed to China-based Changchun BCHT Biotechnology Co. The LAIV vaccine was in-licensed from the

 Institute of Experimental Medicine in St Petersburg, Russia where it has been used for over a decade in many millions of people - children, adults and the elderly. The LAIV is administered by nasal spray and induces a rapid immune response in the mucosal lining of the nose and pharynx. The LAIV is also being developed as a viral vector for making novel non-influenza vaccines for different diseases including cancers. Viruses have the ability to generate proteins prolifically and can be programmed to produce

 disease-specific proteins. As part of a vaccine, disease-specific proteins can help generate a beneficial immune response. SAVINE (patented Scrambled Antigen Vaccine) is a platform technology for the design of antigens for incorporation into vaccines targeting an immune response to a range of different diseases. SAVINE antigens are encoded as synthetic genes which, together with a delivery technology such as BioDiem's LAIV-based vaccine vector technology, can be used to develop novel vaccines. BDM-I is a synthetic compound targeted at the treatment of serious human infections. BDM-I is in the preclinical stage with outlicensing as the intended outcome. BDM-I is active against a range of pathogenic micro-organisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Key patents have been filed around BDM-I's antimicrobial activity, including for activity against Plasmodium falciparum, responsible for causing the most commonly severe form of malaria, and Trichomonas vaginalis, the protozoan responsible for causing a common sexually transmitted disease named trichomoniasis. BioDiem is also developing BDM-E, a tetra peptide synthetic compound, as a treatment for ophthalmic disorders. The US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) has granted Orphan Drug designation to BDM-E for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, a serious degenerative disease of the retina.

123,"In addition to the already existing pressure on our freshwater resources, climate change may further decrease water availability. In this study, projections of future water resources, due to climate change, land use change and changes in water consumption have been assessed using JRC’s LISFLOOD water resources model. The results presented are based on 11 climate models which project current and future climate under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenario. RCP4.5 may be viewed as a moderate-emissions-mitigation-policy scenario and RCP8.5 as a high-end emissions scenario. A 30-year window around the year that global warming reaches 1.5oC, 2oC and 3oC above preindustrial temperature has been analysed and compared to the 1981-2010 control climate window (baseline). The 1.5°C and 2°C warming scenarios are explicitly considered in the Paris Agreement, while a 3°C global warming is a scenario that could be expected by the end of the 21st century if adequate mitigation strategies are not taken. First, we performed future projections without socio-economic developments to show the effect of climate change only. Next, an integrated assessment is performed including future changes in land use, water demand and population. This allows us to disentangle the effects of climate and socio-economic changes. In general, the climate projections reveal a typically North-South pattern across Europe for water availability. Overall, Southern European countries are projected to face decreasing water availability, particularly Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Italy and Turkey.

1022,"From warmer temperatures to more extreme weather, melting glaciers and rising sea levels, humanity is fundamentally changing the planet by pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, US government scientists said on 3 November in their latest assessment of climate science.

The average global temperature has increased by 1 °C since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the 600-page report says — adding that the last 115 years comprise “the warmest period in the history of modern civilization”. The analysis warns that temperatures could increase another 4°C by the end of the century, with dramatic consequences for humans and natural ecosystems.

The findings are at odds with the policies of US President Donald Trump, who has questioned well-established tenets of climate science and vowed to protect and promote the US fossil-fuel industry. Trump's stances led many scientists to worry that his administration would try to block or tamper with the climate-change assessment, but several scientists who helped to write the document reported no problems.

“We weren’t interfered with, and we ended up producing something that I think is of tremendous value,” says David Fahey, an atmospheric scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colorado, and a coordinating lead author of the analysis.

The climate-science report is the first volume of the fourth National Climate Assessment, a legally mandated analysis of the causes and impacts of global warming that is due in 2018. The other two parts of the forthcoming assessment were released today in draft form, for public comment. One analysis focuses on how climate change is affecting life in the United States, from crop yields to property damage from extreme weather. The other summarizes the latest findings on the global carbon cycle. Both of those documents will undergo a formal review by the US National Academy of Sciences.

“The science speaks for itself,” says Don Wuebbles, a a climate scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and co-chair of the climate-science report. “It’s hard to counteract the basic observations and the truth of the science with any kind of political playing around.”

The trio of documents paints a dramatic picture of how global warming is affecting people and communities across the United States. Tidal flooding is accelerating in more than 25 coastal cities along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Large forest fires have become more frequent in the western part of the country, while warmer spring temperatures and shrinking mountain snowpack are combining to reduce the amount of water available to the region's cities and farms. As a result, the draft climate-impacts report warns, “chronic, long-duration hydrological drought is increasingly possible before the end of the century”.

The report comes just days before the latest United Nations climate talks kick off in Bonn, Germany. It will also be the first major summit since Trump vowed to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris climate pact.

Few observers expect US government's latest set of climate-change analyses to affect how the Trump administation approaches energy and environmental issues. In August, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration disbanded an advisory committee that was intended to help the nation prepare for a warmer climate, by translating the findings of the coming climate assessment into guidance for cities, states and industry.

Nor is it clear whether senior Trump administration officials will accept the reports' core scientific conclusions. As recently as March, US Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt said he did not believe that carbon dioxide is major driver of global warming.

Nonetheless, many scientists and environmentalists lauded the new reports for bolstering the case for more-aggressive action against climate change.

“The full assessment, when it gets published, is going to show that there are palpable impacts that are going to hit every part of the country,” says Andrew Light, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank in Washington DC. “It’s the responsibility of leaders to take note of that and act accordingly.”",mainstream,M122c9,climate.change

532,"John Quincy Adams was the sixth president of the United States. He was also the eldest son of President John Adams, the second U.S. president.

John Quincy Adams was the eldest son of President John Adams and the sixth president of the United States. In his pre-presidential years, Adams was one of America's greatest diplomats (formulating, among other things, what became the Monroe Doctrine); in his post-presidential years, he conducted a consistent and often dramatic fight against the expansion of slavery. Though full of promise, his presidential years were difficult. He died in 1848 in Washington, D.C.

Though he was one of few Americans to be so prepared to serve as president of the United States, John Quincy Adams's best years of service came before and after his time in the White House. Born on July 11, 1767, in Braintree, Massachusetts, John Quincy was the son of John Adams, a prodigy of the American Revolution who would become the second U.S. president just before his John Quincy's 30th birthday, and his wife, future first lady Abigail Adams. As a child, Adams witnessed firsthand the birth of the nation. From the family farm, he and his mother watched the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775. At age 10, he traveled to France with his father, who was securing aid during the Revolution. By age 14, Adams was receiving ""on-the-job"" training in the diplomatic corps and going to school. In 1781, he accompanied diplomat Francis Dana to Russia, serving as his secretary and translator. In 1783, he traveled to Paris to serve as secretary to his father, negotiating the Treaty of Paris. During this time, Adams attended schools in Europe and became fluent in French, Dutch and German. Returning home in 1785, he entered Harvard College and graduated in 1787.

In 1790, Adams became a practicing attorney in Boston. As tensions mounted between Britain and France, he supported President George Washington's neutrality policy of 1793. President Washington appreciated young Adams's support so much that he appointed him U.S. minister to Holland. When his father was elected president in 1797, he appointed his son U.S. minister to Prussia. On the way to his post, Adams traveled to England to wed Louisa Catherine Johnson, the daughter of Joshua Johnson, the first U.S. consul to Great Britain. After his father lost his bid for a second term in 1800, he recalled his son from Prussia. In 1802, Adams was elected to the Massachusetts legislature, and one year later, he was elected the U.S. Senate. Like his father, Adams was considered a member of the Federalist Party, but in truth, he was never a strict party man. During his time in the Senate, he supported the Louisiana Purchase and President Thomas Jefferson's Embargo Act—actions that made him very unpopular with other Federalists. In June 1808, Adams broke with the Federalists, resigned from his Senate seat and became a Democratic-Republican. Adams returned to the diplomatic corps in 1809, when President James Madison appointed him the first officially recognized minister to Russia (Francis Dana was never officially accepted as a U.S. ambassador by the Russian government). In 1814, Adams was recalled from Russia to serve as chief negotiator for the U.S. government during the Treaty of Ghent, settling the War of 1812. The following year, Adams served as minister to England, a position his father had held 30 years earlier. In a post he was most suited for, Adams served as secretary of state in President James Monroe's administration from 1817 to 1825. During this time, he negotiated the Adams-Onis Treaty, acquiring Florida for the United States. He also helped negotiate the Treaty of 1818, settling the long-standing border dispute between Britain and the United States over the Oregon Country, and initiating improved relations between Great Britain and its former colonies.

By age 50, Adams had amassed a very impressive record of public service, but perhaps his most notable and enduring achievement was the Monroe Doctrine. After the Napoleonic wars had ended, several Latin American colonies of Spain rose up and declared independence. A defining moment for the United States, Adams crafted the Monroe Doctrine, which stated the United States would resist any European country's efforts to thwart independence movements in Latin America; the doctrine, first introduced in 1823, served to justify U.S. intervention in Latin America throughout the late 19th and most of the 20th centuries.

By 1824, Adams was well-positioned to be the next president of the United States. However, the political climate had changed the way presidents were elected at the time; only the Democratic-Republican Party was viable and five candidates emerged, each representing different sections of the country. Running against Adams were Southerners John C. Calhoun and William Crawford, and Westerners Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson. In addition, by the 1824 election, 18 of 24 states had moved to choose electors to the Electoral College by popular vote instead of to state legislatures. In the Electoral College vote, no one candidate had a clear majority and, subsequently, the election was sent to the House of Representatives. Clay threw his support to Adams, who was elected on the first ballot. Adams's victory shocked Jackson, who had won the popular vote and fully expected to be president. When Adams later appointed Clay secretary of state, Jackson Democrats cried ""corrupt bargain,"" and were enraged at the seemingly quid pro quo arrangement.

Adams entered the presidency with several debilitating political liabilities. He possessed the temperament of his father: Aloof, stubborn and ferociously independent in his convictions. As president, Adams failed to develop the political relationships needed—even among members of his own party—to effect significant change. It didn't help that his political opponents were set on making him a one-term president. In his first year in office, Adams proposed several far-sighted programs that he felt would promote science, as well as encourage a spirit of enterprise and invention in the United States; these goals included building a network of highways and canals to link the different sections of the country, setting aside public lands for conservation, surveying the entire U.S. coast and building astronomical observatories. Adams also saw the need for practical solutions to universal problems, thusly calling for the establishment of a uniform system of weights and measures and improving the patent system. While these may have been admirable goals for an aspiring nation, they were considered overambitious and unrealistic for the United States in the 1820s. Adams's proposals were met with scorn and derision by political opponents; critics charged that the president's policies would enlarge the powers and influence of the federal government at the expense of the state and local governments, and some accused Adams of promoting programs to enhance the elite and neglect the common people. In the midterm election of 1826, Jacksonian opponents won majorities in both Houses of Congress. As a result, many of Adams's initiatives either failed to pass legislation or were woefully underfunded. The election of 1828 was an especially bitter and personal affair. As was the tradition, neither candidate personally campaigned, but supporters conducted ruthless attacks on the opposing candidates. The campaign reached a low point when the press accused Jackson's wife, Rachel, of bigamy. Adams lost the election by a decisive margin, and he left Washington without attending Jackson's inauguration.

Adams did not retire from public life after leaving the presidential office. In 1830, he ran for and won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, once again distinguishing himself as a statesman of the first order. In 1836, Adams focused his long-standing anti-slavery sentiment on defeating a gag-rule instituted by Southerners to stifle debate. In 1841, he argued in front of the Supreme Court on behalf of escaped African slaves in the famous Amistad case, and won the release of the captives. On February 21, 1848, in his last contribution to his country, Adams was on the floor of the House of Representatives, arguing to honor U.S. Army officers who had served in the Mexican-American War (he opposed the war, but felt that the U.S. government was obligated to honor its veterans). During the event, Adams suddenly collapsed, suffering from a massive cerebral hemorrhage. He was taken to the Speaker's Room in the Capitol Building, where he died two days later, on February 23, 1848.",mainstream,M0cd8b,climate.change

More than 100 bushfires are raging in Australia as the continent swelters under record heat, a double whammy of extremes that has amplified scrutiny of what experts say is stark inaction from the government on climate change.

Blazes across New South Wales and Queensland have scorched almost 7 million acres, and Australia experienced its hottest day on record Wednesday, when the average temperature across the country hit 105 degrees.

The nation's woes are unfolding as Australia faces criticism for what have been described as its inadequate climate policies, including the role of federal officials in thwarting negotiations at a recent U.N. summit on climate change.

Richie Merzian, director of the climate and energy program at the Australia Institute, a Canberra-based think tank that conducts public policy research, called the 2019 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change a letdown. The summit ended Sunday in a stalemate, with countries largely delaying major decisions on plans to cut carbon emissions until next year's conference.

""It was terribly disappointing,"" Merzian said. ""Australia is literally on fire right now, and it's clearly linked to climate change in terms of its severity and duration. But instead of going there to rally the world behind the need for greater climate action, Australia was lobbying to do as little as possible.""

Seasonal bushfires occur naturally in Australia, but hotter and drier conditions due to climate change have increased the frequency of fires and their severity, said Andy Pitman, a climate modeler at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

""There is an uncontroversial link whereby higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere from climate change increase bushfire risk,"" Pitman said. ""All other things being equal, a fire that occurs now will be worse than a fire that occurred 20 to 30 years ago.""

Trees play an integral role in the planet's carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide as they grow. But research has shown that when vegetation dries out — as during hot and dry summer months — the increased amount of carbon dioxide acts as extra fuel for wildfires.

Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, release greenhouse gases that trap heat and raise surface temperatures. A 2018 State of the Climate report from the Australian government's Bureau of Meteorology found that the country has warmed by just over 1 degree Celsius since 1910, ""leading to an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events.""

Those heat waves, combined with dry conditions, are dangerous ingredients for bushfires, Pitman said, with circumstances appearing to be particularly severe at the moment.

""This is unprecedented,"" Pitman said. ""I don't think we've ever seen bushfires at this scale before.""

Bushfires are also problematic because they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Australia's fires are estimated to have emitted 250 million tons of carbon dioxide already — nearly half of the nation's total yearly average emissions — according to NASA data provided to The Guardian.

Those events have renewed focus on Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, who has refused to answer questions about climate change and their link to the fires. His conservative administration has also faced backlash for its policies and rhetoric surrounding global warming.

In November, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said climate change concerns were stoked by ""raving inner-city lefties,"" adding that there had been fires in Australia ""since time began.""

Pitman said that while there had been some progress made on the state level, the federal government had shown a lack of political will.

""They almost see it as a negotiating or debating point, and it's not,"" Pitman said. ""This is an existential risk to communities and major regions of the planet, and if governments don't act, then the situation will simply deteriorate.""

Imran Ahmad, a climate scientist at Australian National University, said the Morrison administration's stance was symptomatic of Australia's complex history of climate change policy.

""There is an ideological drive against climate change by certain vested interests,"" he said.

Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and its third-largest exporter of fossil fuels, after Russia and Saudi Arabia. Merzian, who worked as a climate negotiator for the government for almost a decade, said those economic ties have shaped the country's climate policies for decades — and invite international criticism.

""You can't be the largest exporter of coal, which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions when consumed, and not take any responsibility for that,"" Merzian said.

In 2012, Australia's Labor Government introduced a carbon tax that helped the country reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 1.4 percent by the end of its second year. But the policy was unpopular, and in 2014, the newly elected government repealed the tax.

""Any new tax is unpopular, but unfortunately, by the time it was dismantled, we could see that it was working,"" Merzian said. ""It was reducing emissions, but it just didn't have enough momentum to survive quite a strong negative campaign.""

As one of the countries that ratified the 2015 Paris Agreement, a global pact aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, Australia will join 187 other countries in pledging to meet its reduction goals next year. Pitman said Australia has much at stake, with fragile ecosystems, such as the Great Barrier Reef, under severe threat from warming oceans and the country's bushfires. Still, he added, it's difficult to be optimistic about the country's direction.

""The Great Barrier Reef is a multibillion-dollar asset to Australia, and it's being sacrificed at the altar of carbon dioxide emissions,"" he said. ""It's really important to understand that decisions that need to be made on carbon emission are politically painful, and there is no one more skilled at avoiding difficult political decisions than politicians.""",mainstream,M0a42a,climate.change
63,"Climate Change - what are we doing?

The council adopted a Climate Change Strategy in April 2014, which was refreshed in 2017 to bring it up to speed with other local and national developments in the climate change agenda. It included the adoption of national targets around carbon emission reductions and the use of renewable energy. The following three pledges underpin the work the council has been doing on climate change:
• To lead by example in reducing its carbon emissions year on year.
• To help residents, community groups and businesses to reduce their emissions and manage climate risks.
• To work with partners to help raise awareness and support initiatives to reduce and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

We are now developing a draft Climate Change and Air Quality Strategy that we plan to publish for consultation later in 2020. This will outline the steps that we’ll be taking to tackle the issue and reduce our impact on the environment.

The drive to become a carbon neutral borough by 2030 starts now and we have started work to set out the steps we as a council can take and how we can work together as a borough.

In December 2019, we held a climate change summit to bring together ideas with partners. View a copy of the presentation and the Outcomes Report.

Already we have:
• Installed solar panels on the roof of several of our council buildings.
• Improved the energy performance of the council’s Deanes and Parklands buildings
• Set up a group of Environment Champions to promote sustainable practices among staff.
• Installed a fresh air cooling system at the Civic Offices, as well as being environmentally-friendly, the initiative will generate a saving of £9,500 per year.
• Reduced the distances our bin trucks travel by rebalancing the rounds, with a monthly carbon saving of 3.8% per month.

With partners, we have:
• Adopted a transport strategy with a focus on encouraging more sustainable transport including cycling and walking.
• Given out loans and grants to improve insulation and install renewable energy sources.
• Supported residents to apply for government funding for energy efficient boilers.

We are working on our next steps looking at greener ways of delivering council services. Here are just a few of the projects we are working on:
• With advice from the Energy Savings Trust we are exploring greater use of electric vehicles.
• Updating our Local Plan to ensure tougher standards associated with climate change and emissions.
• Reviewing the energy efficiency of our accommodation and our staff and councillors’ travel.
• Delivering 3,500 homes at Manydown using the Garden Towns’ principle.",mainstream,M0a2ee,climate.change
331,"Does wearing tight pants or underwear like tighty-whities affect sperm count?

 – Carson*

Although some studies have shown a decrease in sperm count from wearing tight-fitting underwear, others have not.

The testicles may seem like they just get in the way sometimes. But the main reason ""the boys"" are on the outside of the body is because the body's internal temperature of 98.6°F is too hot for sperm production. So by ""hanging out,"" the scrotum keeps sperm a few degrees cooler.

Too much heat can lower sperm count (but not enough to act as a form of birth control). So tight clothing and underwear that keep testicles closer to body heat might, in theory, affect sperm count. But many experts think there isn't enough of a temperature change to make any significant difference.

1041,"Edward Snowden, the hacker who gained access to every secret corner of the Internet during his tenure at the NSA, has come forward with details of a classified project to alter the world’s climate. The shocking truth, as he says, is that chemtrails are part of a benevolent program aimed at countering global warming. By cooperating in secret with jet fuel manufacturers, government agents have carefully kept the massive chemtrail efforts completely under wraps.

“I am only revealing this program because there is no oversight in the scientific community, no public discussion, and little concern for the side-effects which are well known only to a few privileged people interested in continuing the decades-long chemtrail program in secret.”

According to Snowden, chemtrails are the only thing keeping the US from global warming incineration, but at what price?

Because climate change is a threat to U.S. agriculture, it has been labeled a national security issue. With the influence and cooperation of Monsanto, a secret Geo-engineering lab dubbed Muad’Dib has been operating since the late 1960s, and the chemtrail program is often referred to by insiders as its “crown jewel.” Muad’Dib has aimed to protect North America’s climate at all costs – even if that means accelerating desertification in Sub-Saharan Africa or spreading trace amounts of carcinogens over lightly populated areas. Other side effects, which scientists at the secret Muad’Dib Geoengineering Lab have predicted, include droughts in the Amazon and powerful windstorms along the East Coast.

Snowden shared decisive documents with The Internet Chronicle, but out of concern for national security, only his testimonial can be published. These documents contain references to scientists who would surely be targeted by foreign counterintelligence, and their knowledge is vital to short-term survival of the United States.

Snowden said, “If this program were to stop, the scientists behind it strongly believe that within just one year the North American climate would spiral out of control, and crop failures would lead to a series of devastating famines that would quickly depopulate urban centers.”

Because the program has been carried out on such a massive scale, skeptics might find Snowden’s story unbelievable. However, Snowden explained that the chemtrail program has been incredibly easy to hide, especially with the cooperation of jet fuel companies, a crucial part of the military-industrial complex. Snowden said, “The chemicals which are released by passenger airplanes have been covertly introduced as ‘additives,’ supposedly to improve efficiency. Only as the plane reaches cruising velocity does the heat and atmospheric pressure cause a chemical reaction that synthesizes the top secret carbon-trapping molecule. This process is imperfect, and many of the by-products are incredibly dangerous even in trace quantities. The most dangerous thing is that although chemtrails are keeping the climate of the U.S. reasonably stable, citizens are bombarded every day with an invisible rain of carbon-laden molecules, and the effect on health is totally unknown.”",conspiracy,C01b2d,chemtrails; climate.change

The ad, which was posted by The Really Online Lefty League, was removed for violating Facebook's advertising policies after it was rated false by a third-party fact-checking site Lead Stories.

The ad featured a 90-second long video, which was edited to make it appear as if Graham supported Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal.

“From a Republican point of view, I think we need to look at the science, admit that climate change is real,” Graham says in the ad.

“Simply put, we believe in the Green New Deal.”

Despite the ad being removed, the video accompanying the ad is still available on The Really Online Lefty League’s Facebook page.

When asked if he still believed the UN was trying to impose a worldwide government through climate change policy, Mr Roberts answered: “Definitely”.

In 2011, Mr Roberts wrote a letter to then Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard demanding to be exempted from the country’s carbon tax.

The letter, addressed to “The Woman, Julia-Eileen:Gillard”, contained a 28-point affidavit that sought to establish Mr Roberts’ exemption from the need to obey the Australian government.

Mr Roberts also wrote a report in 2013 entitled CSRIOh!: Climate of Deception, Or First Step to Freedom? that detailed his rejection of man-made global warming.

774,"People often confuse the concepts of global warming and climate change, and it doesn’t help that media companies often substitute one for the other in TV, newspaper, and social media reporting. This is somewhat understandable since the two concepts overlap a great deal. In fact, there is a causal relationship between the two. However, there are some subtle and some not-so-subtle differences between global warming and climate change.

The phrase global warming is used by scientists to mean a long-term increase in Earth’s average air temperature. It can refer specifically to such warming that is due to the influence of rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Earth’s surface gets most of its heat from the energy associated with the Sun’s rays, which strike the planet’s surface during the day. At night most of this energy is radiated back into space. Greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, and chlorofluorocarbons [CFCs]) absorb infrared radiation (net heat energy) emitted from Earth’s surface and radiate it back to the surface, thus contributing to the greenhouse effect. Though the recent rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is arguably the main factor affecting global warming, other factors are involved (such as variations in Earth’s orbit, the angle of the planet’s axis, and variations in the Sun’s energy output). Nevertheless, as higher concentrations of greenhouse gases allow Earth’s atmosphere to hold on to greater amounts of heat that would normally escape into space at night, Earth’s average temperature rises.

Climate change is a bit different. Before we look into what climate change is, it may be helpful to think a bit about climate with respect to weather. Weather, which is often confused with climate, is the set of conditions in the atmosphere in one location for a limited period of time, such as throughout the day, at night, or at any particular point during the day. Climate, on the other hand, is the average condition of the atmosphere in a given location over a long period of time, such as 30 years or more. Thus, climate change is a longer-term change in the average condition of the atmosphere.

Human beings most certainly contribute to climate change by adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, but this is only part of the equation. Earth’s climate can change over time not only because of changes in the atmosphere but also because of interactions between the atmosphere and various geologic, chemical, biological, and geographic factors. For example, regional climates (as well as Earth’s global climate) can change in response to a sustained period of heavy volcanic activity. Much of that activity is related in turn to the movement of Earth’s tectonic plates, which drives the continents across the surface of the planet. Over hundreds of thousands to millions of years, the continents collide with other continents or break apart, changing the paths of ocean currents and local winds. This affects the transport of heat from the tropics to the poles. Earth’s global climate has also changed in response to drastic changes in atmospheric chemistry—notably the rise in oxygen concentrations billions of years ago when plants, algae, and other forms of life capable of photosynthesis began to spread across the planet.

As the world continues to come to grips with how human activities influence Earth’s climate, the tangible effects of climate change that is caused by global warming—such as melting glaciers and ice caps, rising sea levels, and changes in seasonal temperature and rainfall patterns—are becoming the focus. With such disruptions becoming more and more apparent, many scientists are discussing them increasingly in terms of real long-term climatic changes rather than simply remarking about Earth’s average temperature. Consequently, climate change can also refer to the cause-and-effect relationship between global warming and climate change. That is, it can refer to a change in the average condition of the atmosphere brought on by global warming.",mainstream,M0950f,climate.change; global.warming

With his environmental documentary “2040,” writer-director Damon Gameau set out to create a letter from the future, a self-described “exercise in fact-based dreaming,” for his 4-year-old daughter Velvet. His goal: present Velvet and her generation a positive path for battling climate change utilizing only solutions that are presently available.

Gameau initiated this vision of the future by asking 100 children from around the world what they would like 2040 to look like. He was startled by how aware the kids (ages 6-11) are of the challenges the world is facing and weaves their voices into the film as an unjaded chorus of boundless potential (“Clean water!” “End deforestation!” “Rocket boots!” “National hot dog day!”).

Turning to experts in various fields, Gameau learns about solar-powered microgrids, localized economies, electric self-driving cars, urban food farms, regenerative agriculture, marine permaculture, resource awareness and increased educational opportunities for girls (perhaps the most surprising element presented). Every solution is then dramatized as to how it might affect the world of a 20-something Velvet.

The effect is inspiring and empowering. Fanciful animation, graphics and special effects, abetted by Gameau’s down under whimsy, make the film as entertaining as it is educational. Powered by unbridled optimism, Gameau defies skeptics by doing his homework and bringing receipts.

887,"Ocasio-Cortez Tries To Blame Republicans For Historic Flash Flooding in DC

2.79 inches of rain came down in just one hour in Washington D.C.

Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has attempted to blame Republicans for the historic flash flooding that occurred in the nation’s capital Monday. 



2.79 inches of rain came down in just one hour in Washington D.C., which beat the 1945 record of 2.05 inches in the same period, The Washington Post reported.

But AOC seemingly blamed Republicans and their support for the fossil fuel industry for the reason behind the flooding.

“Unprecedented flooding is quickly becoming a new normal,” she tweeted.

“Despite that, Republicans are tripling down on fossil fuels w/no plan to transition off them, or make the critical infra investments we need to prep for the climate crisis.”

“Climate change intensifies flooding, wildfires, & extreme weather. It’s more than 1 day or 1 storm; it’s all of them.""

""Places are flooding where they haven’t before; there are 90-degree days in Alaska in June.""

""The GOP will mock & sow confusion until it’s their home swept away,” she added.

But Ocasio-Cortez failed to explain how fossil fuels and Monday morning’s historic flooding were related.

Her claims are not surprising though, as she blamed weather calamities on her political opponents.

In May, AOC attempted to convince her social media followers that Washington DC tornado warning was linked to ""Climate Change"" but ended up getting schooled by a meteorologist.

After attempting to blame the weather on a ""climate crisis,"" Ocasio-Cortez was promptly shredded by renowned meteorologist Ryan Maue, who accused the radical New York lawmaker of not understanding ""the difference between weather and climate.""

Following a brief, and rare, tornado warning inside the Beltway, the freshman congresswoman began by sharing a short video on Instagram showing the conditions outside, as heavy rains drenched the region.

Now, as scientists with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gather in Sweden this week to approve portions of the IPCC’s fifth assessment report, they are finding themselves pressured to explain this glaring discrepancy.

The panel, a United Nations creation that shared the 2007Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore, hopes to brief world leaders on the current state of climate science in a clear, unified voice. However, experts inside and outside the process say members probably will engage in heated debate over the causes and significance of the so-called global warming hiatus.",conspiracy,C01abd,climate.change; global.warming
261,"How To Discuss “Climate Change” With A ‘Woke’ Teenager

After our daughter of fifteen years of age was moved to tears by the speech of Greta Thunberg at the UN the other day, she became angry with our generation “who had been doing nothing for thirty years.”

So, we decided to help her prevent what the girl on TV announced of “massive eradication and the disappearance of entire ecosystems.”

We are now committed to give our daughter a future again, by doing our part to help cool the planet four degrees.

From now on she will go to school on a bicycle, because driving her by car costs fuel, and fuel puts emissions into the atmosphere. Of course it will be winter soon and then she will want to go by bus, but cycling through the freezing builds resilience.

Of course, she is now asking for an electric bicycle, but we have shown her the devastation caused to the areas of the planet as a result of mining for the extraction of Lithium and other minerals used to make batteries for electric bicycles, so she will be pedaling, or walking.

Which will not harm her, or the planet. We used to cycle and walk to school too.

Since the girl on TV demanded “we need to get rid of our dependency on fossil fuels” and our daughter agreed with her, we have disconnected the heat vent in her room. The temperature is now dropping to twelve degrees in the evening, and will drop below freezing in the winter, we have promised to buy her an extra sweater, hat, tights, gloves and a blanket.

For the same reason we have decided that from now on she only takes a cold shower. She will wash her clothes by hand, with a wooden washboard, because the washing machine is simply a power consumer and since the dryer uses natural gas, she will hang her clothes on the clothes line to dry, just like my parents and grandparents used to do.

Speaking of clothes, the ones that she currently has are all synthetic, so made from petroleum. Therefore on Monday, we will bring all her designer clothing to the secondhand shop.

We have found an eco store where the only clothing they sell is made from undyed and unbleached linen and jute. Also can’t have clothes made on wool, because the emissions from farting sheep are supposedly causing bad weather.

It shouldn’t matter that it looks good on her, or that she is going to be laughed at, dressing in colorless, bland clothes and without a wireless bra, but that is the price she has to pay for the benefit of The Climate.

Cotton is out of the question, as it comes from distant lands and pesticides are used for it. Very bad for the environment.

 We just saw on her Instagram that she’s pretty angry with us. This was not our intention.

From now on, at 7 p.m. we will turn off the WiFi and we will only switch it on again the next day after dinner for two hours. In this way we will save on electricity, so she is not bothered by electro-stress and will be totally isolated from the outside world. This way, she can concentrate solely on her homework. At eleven o’clock in the evening we will pull the breaker to shut the power off to her room, so she knows that dark is really dark. That will save a lot of CO2.

She will no longer be participating in winter sports to ski lodges and resorts, nor will she be going on anymore vacations with us, because our vacation destinations are practically inaccessible by bicycle.

Since our daughter fully agrees with the girl on TV that the CO2 emissions and footprints of her great-grandparents are to blame for ‘killing our planet’, what all this simply means, is that she also has to live like her great-grandparents and they never had a holiday, a car or even a bicycle.

We haven’t talked about the carbon footprint of food yet.

Zero CO2 footprint means no meat, no fish and no poultry, but also no meat substitutes that are based on soy (after all, that grows in farmers fields, that use machinery to harvest the beans, trucks to transport to the processing plants, where more energy is used, then trucked to the packaging/canning plants, and trucked once again to the stores) and also no imported food, because that has a negative ecological effect. And absolutely no chocolate from Africa, no coffee from South America and no tea from Asia.

Only homegrown potatoes, vegetables and fruit that have been grown in local cold soil, because greenhouses run on boilers, piped in CO2 and artificial light. Apparently, these things are also bad for The Climate. We will teach her how to grow her own food.

Bread is still possible, but butter, milk, cheese and yogurt, cottage cheese and cream come from cows and they emit CO2. No more margarine and no oils will be used for the frying pan, because that fat is palm oil from plantations in Borneo where rain forests first grew.

No ice cream in the summer. No soft drinks and no energy drinks, as the bubbles are CO2.

We will also ban all plastic, because it comes from chemical factories. Everything made of steel and aluminum must also be removed. Have you ever seen the amount of energy a blast furnace consumes or an aluminum smelter? All bad for the climate!

We will replace her memory foam pillow top mattress, with a jute bag filled with straw, with a horse hair pillow.

And finally, she will no longer be using makeup, soap, shampoo, cream, lotion, conditioner, toothpaste and medication. Facewashers will all be linen, that she can wash by hand, with her wooden washboard, just like her female ancestors did before climate change made her angry at us for destroying her future.

In this way we will help her to do her part to prevent mass extinction, water levels rising and the disappearance of entire ecosystems.

If she truly believes she wants to walk the talk of the girl on TV, she will gladly accept and happily embrace her new way of life.

478,"BIR SALAH, TUNISIA - Samira Sghaier and a group of friends prune moringa trees under a searing sun, dropping fistfuls of leafy branches into plastic tubs. Prickly acacias edge the plot of land, protecting bone-dry soil from further erosion.

Sghaier’s father once grew olive and fruit trees — varieties that mostly shriveled and died under her watch. “There hasn’t been enough rain in recent years,” says the 52-year-old farmer.

Her tiny farm in eastern Tunisia is a bellwether for the dramatic environmental changes already reshaping North Africa, which threaten to intensify with climate change.

Sandwiched between an encroaching Sahara and a warming Mediterranean Sea, the region has seen a sharp drop in rainfall over the past half century—a trend experts say will likely intensify in the coming decades. Indeed, over the course of this century parts of North Africa as well as the Middle East might become uninhabitable, according to the German research and policy organization, the Max Planck Institute.

“We’re seeing higher temperatures and increasing water stress,” says Essia Guezzi, climate and energy project officer for conservation group WWF North Africa, summing up some of the regional challenges. Meanwhile, rising sea levels threaten the region’s largely coastal populations, she and others note.

These and other issues will come into sharp focus during next month’s climate summit in Spain, a fellow member of the Mediterranean region that is considered a climate hotspot—more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than other parts of the world.



 While Morocco has earned praise as a climate-change leader, the North African region overall needs to do much more to counter an otherwise grim future, experts say. Also hampering efforts: some countries are buffeted by conflict and civil unrest, while fossil fuels continue to drive Algerian and Libyan economies.

Trying to turn the tide

In Tunisia, fresh groundwater reserves are shrinking rapidly. Roughly two-thirds of the land is threatened by desertification. The effects of climate change are likely to slow the country’s growth, hitting two major revenue drivers—tourism and agriculture—according to a 2018 report by the Netherlands Foreign Ministry.

While Tunisian authorities have outlined ambitious targets — including cutting emissions 41 percent by 2030 compared to 2010 levels—they have been slow to match words with action, critics say. Nor did the issue figure high on candidates’ priorities in recent legislative and presidential elections.

“It seems like the environment and the impact of climate change is the last concern of many Tunisian politicians,” says Hamadi Gharbi, WWF North Africa Climate and Energy project manager, who says the country also needs more climate financing and expertise.

In the village of Bir Salah, Sghaier is trying, at least locally, to turn the tide. She and other area farmers began planting hardy acacia trees to help reduce erosion, along with moringa, a fast-growing plant prized for its nutritional and medicinal properties.

The idea was to help fight climate change and earn a profit doing so. The reality has not been so easy.

“Everyone likes new products,” Sghaier says, showing a visitor her storeroom packed with moringa oils and powders, along with bags of moringa-based bsissa, a Tunisian breakfast drink, which a group of growers have made and packaged.

“The problem is selling them,” she says. “It’s hard to find a market.”

Across the Sahara, the African Union has spearheaded an ambitious ‘Great Green Wall’ initiative aimed to restore degraded land across a swathe of the Sahel, while also offering income-generating opportunities for communities living there.

“The goal is to replant trees, to return the Sahel to what it was about 60 years ago, when there was a lot more forest cover,” says anthropologist Gilles Boetsch, director of a French scientific team working with Senegalese researchers in the region.

There are plenty of setbacks he says. Many trees die and need to be replaced, while conflict in some Sahel countries makes areas inaccessible.

“It doesn’t work 100 percent, but it works,” Boetsch says, adding a similar regional initiative could also work north of the Sahara. “The first problem is water. The second is getting communities to accept the projects.”

In North Africa, some national projects to fight climate change are making a difference, and Tunisia will reportedly present a regional oases protection project at the Madrid climate conference.

Local farmers in northern Algeria are getting Mexican expertise to plant prickly pear, a cactus that offers a raft of nutritional and money-generating benefits and needs little rainfall. Algeria is also trying to revive a massive ‘Green Dam’ reforestation project that previously had disappointing results.

In Tunisia’s southeastern Gabes region, Dhafer Guezguez worked with the local government in European Union-financed projects that included restoring oases and reintroduce native date palm species. The plants are hardy and nutritious, he says, but not as sweet as popular commercial varieties. Attracting consumers will need serious marketing.

“They need to be showcased as a product that’s rare and good for you,” Guezguez says. “The same kind of effort we saw in Europe and the United States to get people to eat organic products.”

The oases preservation initiatives have helped to boost local economies and restore depleted soil, he says. Women dominate the workforce. The projects have continued even after EU financing ended. Participants are also making tourist handicrafts like palm leaf bags and hats, to earn extra revenue.

“I think this is how, little by little, we can save the oases,” Guezguez says. “When local communities realize it’s in their interest to do so.",mainstream,M0ce84,climate.change
1319,"Here we see swaddling clothes for the baby - and a shroud for the mother. Here we see a baby's cradle connected tragically with a woman's coffin. Here we hear a birth cry and a death gurgle at one and the same time.

The dying mother's last act was to name her child. ""And she named the child Ichabod."" And her last testimony was - as she thought upon the ark of God being taken by the Philistines - ""The glory is departed from Israel.

""It was goodbye to glory!""

Let us make some applications of that statement, even though we may appear as those who carve epitaphs on tombstones, or as those who write obituaries, or as those who wailingly and discordantly participate in funeral dirges. Though we may be asking you to look through old windows upon scenes which others have described, though we may travel some well-worn and familiar trails, though we may serve the same food in somewhat different platters, still we make bold to ask you to remember that 'tis true'.

A Nation May Lose Its Glory

The wife of Phinehas, passing through the swirling waters of the river of death, said: ""The glory is departed from Israel ""Thoughtfully scanning the pages of history, rubbing the dust of centuries off the tombs of some nations that underwent the frightful processes of self-burial, we can give the same testimonies concerning other nations. For 'tis true that, warmed by the sun which never loses its glory, a nation's sun may set in night. Under the stars - stars which never lose their splendor a nation's starry crown may lose its brightness, being displaced by a withered wreath of poison ivy or a circle of undesirable cactus, or by the brow becoming an eyeless, earless, tongueless, brainless skull.

Beneath the heavens which declare the glory of God, even as the firmament showeth His handiwork, a nation that circled the clouds as a strong-winged eagle, can flutter among the clouds as a broken- winged vulture or squawking parrot. Among the flowery continents of God a nation can become a place of foul odours that make the righteous stop their noses.

[Ancient Babylon] Great was the glory of Babylon of old; but Babylon became a vermin-infested, animal-prowling jungle - Babylon, ""the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency,"" became ""as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah."" Something of the tragic departure of its glory is told in these words:

""It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall he full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.""- Isaiah 13:20-22.

[Ancient Carthage] Great was the glory of Carthage centuries ago. But her commanders became as impotent as skeletons of cattle scattered on desert sands. Her swift feet became as a cripple's walk - her clenched fist as the fumbling fingers of a paralytic.

[Ancient Syria] Wondrous the glory of Syria at a time when Eleanor's troubadours at Antioch bewitched the Syrian air with ballads of the South - and lightened the horrors of the second crusade. But Syria's glory departed when the following was said. ""But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; They are revolted and gone.""- Jeremiah 5:23.

[Ancient Greece] Great was the glory of ancient Greece - especially from 450 B.C. to 350 B.C. - under Pericles. But Greece became a moulded crust in history's garbage heap. Greece had her Athens -- civilization's queen. Plato was hers. Socrates was hers. A vast multitude of seers was hers. Phidias, raising beautiful children unto Athens from the sterile womb of stone, marbled many places with sculptured wonders. The Muses tented in her gates and plumed the arts with eagle's wings. At many shrines the human brain bowed in reverence. But with all these persons, with all these things of beauty, Greece became a moulded crust in history's garbage can.

[Ancient Rome] Great the glory of the Rome of centuries far back and forever gone - especially from 50 B.C. to 60 A.D. - with her astute statesmen, with her close-meshed code of laws, with her sword-woven mantle, coin- embroidered, that fell on cities where merchants congregated and fattened on the spoils of trade, with her armies that feasted and fattened on blood.

Rome was mighty among the kingdoms - mighty wherever ships and swords and thrones and lust of gold and sovereignty constituted the boasted heritage of the age. But Rome and her glory became as a mouth full of pyorrheic gums holding rotten teeth, all loose and foul.

[Ancient Nineveh] Great the glory of the nation-like realm of Nineveh - with her winged lions symbolic of strength and speed. But Nineveh became as a vari-colored butterfly enmeshed and perishing in the net of a relentless spider.

[Ancient Egypt] Great the glory of old ancient Egypt - the land of the Pharaohs -the land of wealth and wonders. But it became a shabby sexton of splendid tombs - her torch of far-reaching splendor became a pot of smoke without one spark of remaining radiance.

[Ancient Spain] Great was the glory of ancient Spain - back there in the glorious years beyond recall. Wide and strong was the sway of her scepter. Her piratical ships harassed all the seas and filled her coffers with gold. But this nation, with climate and conquests and caches of coin, with thrones and crowns and scepters, with laughter and love and lure, with men and money and might, with fervor and force and fruit, became as a drowsy and lousy and frowsy beggar watching a broken clock.

[Ancient Jerusalem] And let us ask you to think of Jerusalem - ""beautiful for situation ""- as representative of the nation Israel. Triumphant were her temples. Her past ""shines glorious as doth the moon on midnight seas."" For favoured Jerusalem, kings kneeled down and prayed. For glorious Jerusalem, prophets, in tears and love, served. For beautiful Jerusalem, martyrs shriveled into flame. In Jerusalem's virgin face were eyes in which, deep-folded, lay prophecies of the Son of God.

But because within her sacred courts evil was girt with diadem, Jerusalem hardened her heart. Jerusalem bloodied her hands. Jerusalem deafened her ears. Jerusalem played the harlot. And Jesus described her then departing and afterward utterly departed glory in these words, ""Thy house is left unto thee desolate.""

Covered this blood-soaked earth with the wreck of once-glorious cities. Scarred the face of this war-blighted earth with the ruin of once-glorious nations. Marred the fair face of this world with the wreck of once-glorious civilizations - civilizations which have left behind them nothing but the smoke of the brilliant torch, nothing more than an empty name, nothing more than the shadow of a shadow.

What the Bible says about some nations and some cities - representatives in large measure of once- proud, once-strong, once-influential civilizations - is true of other nations and cities of the past and the present:

""For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, That Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes...

""Also Edom shall be a desolation. every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof...

""And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever; there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it. ""- Jeremiah 49:13,17,33.

""This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, That said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one That passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.""- Zephaniah 2:15.

In America we must remember that the glory of a nation is righteousness and faith in God - and going the way God points - and in such is our security against all foes, our immunity against the ravages of time.

""For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish, yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.""- Isaiah 60:12. This sober truth that only righteousness exalteth a nation -- that if ever America loses her faith in God she will have to come off her pedestal, that pallbearers that carried other nations to their graves will do work for us if we forsake God and refuse to go the way He points -- was put upon our hearts once by the editor of the Watchman-Examiner in these words:

""We should remember that one hundred years ago Germany was regarded as the most Christian nation in Europe. Germany's evangelicalism was once so pronounced that Martin Luther gave us the marvelous translation of the Scriptures and directed the world to the Bible. The Scriptures so influenced the Home, the School, and the Church of Germany that the national life saw a phenomenal progress. Germany was now making terrific strides in science, art, and culture. Then came a day when innate conceit got to work. Christianity was emasculated. Christ was rationalized to be nothing more than a good man. The Holy Scriptures were reduced to a crazy quilt. Religion came to be built on negatives. God was dwarfed and man was deified. 'Let the strong survive,' became the new religion. Germany was decivilized and Hitler had no trouble getting his followers to arm to the hilt to conquer the world.""

Let us ask the help of Almighty God in these days when men ""loose wild tongues that hold not God in awe,"" when there are evils that would lead our greatest graces to the grave and leave the world no copy. When the atheistic deformities of our times would coerce us into substituting for Christianity's vital bread a chunk of froth scattered by miasmatic winds - lest our country become a despised Ichabod among the nations of earth.

A Church May Lose Her Glory

""Thy glory hath departed ""Too bad and too sad when that is spoken of a church about which glorious things once were spoken. 'Tis tragic, 'tis true that of some churches such is the epitaphic description of their decay, their inverted torch, their oil-less lamps, their turning back in the day of battle - though armed and carrying bows. That is grief for angels. That is laughter for devils. That is gloating for Satan. That is groaning for Christ's followers.

A church can ""leave its first love ""The church at Ephesus did - and needed to ""repent and do the first works ""Revelation 2:4,5. A church can change from an army into an ecclesiastical nursery wherein the preacher is looked upon as a head nurse who has more to do with milk bottles for sickly saints than with mighty battles against seductive Satan. Then does its glory depart.

A church can change from a church of compassionate concern into a church of callisthenic conventionality utterly devoid of devotional vitality - censorious of spiritual and far-sighted leadership, worldly, wayward, and peevishly puny. Then can Ichabod be written over its portals, its pews, its pulpit.

A church can change from a cataract of activity into a scum-covered pond of stagnation.

Thus, forgetting that ""she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth,"" she hastens the departure of her glory.

A church can change from a church of aggressive conquest into a church possessive of a slothful timidity, a passive acquiescence in small attainments, a criminal spineless in the face of evils that arrogantly challenge, a careless in- difference to great stretches of the unattained.

Thus is Ichabod an appropriate adjective for its activities and aimlessness. A church can be a roller of marbles when it should be a remover of mountains. Thus does its spiritual muscle become flabby, its fingers fumbling, its feet halt - as the glory departs.

A church can put its headlight on the rear and think only of the glory that was. Then and thus does its light grow dim, its voice faltering, its spiritual ambitions anemic, its worship boresomely lacking in life, its glory one of the past. Pathetic the words that fell from the Master's lips. ""And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!

And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down"" Mark 13:1,2. They were great buildings. They were magnificent stones. But to his eyes they were nothing more than ruins, for the glory of the temple's worship and service had departed.

""But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart""- I Sam. 16:7.

Outwardly that beautiful and stately temple seemed destined to ""defy the tooth of time."" Inwardly it was hollow and empty and tottering to its fall. Write ""Ichabod"" upon it.

Is it possible for a church, when God calls it to ""launch out into the deep ""in the matter of soul-winning, to become ""a drifting sepulcher manned by a frozen crew?""

Well, when academic luster takes the place of spiritual passion, when refrigeration is valued above conflagration, such is the danger.

I once heard Dr. Perry Webb say: ""The atmosphere in some churches is so cold, you can skate down the aisles.""

Is it true that a church may be noted for the gorgeous architecture of its building, the lovely music of its choir, the stateliness of its ritual, the fine-functioning of all its organizations, the largeness of numbers as to its congregation, the influence in many circles of business and social and educational life - and yet be, in the eyes of Him who marks the sparrow's fall, as a corpse wrapped in an ornate shroud?

Of the church at Sardis, Jesus, risen and enthroned, said: ""And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write, These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.""- Revelation 3:1.

Somebody described another church like unto the church at Sardis in these words:

Outwardly splendid as of old -

Inwardly sparkless, void and cold - 

Her force and fire all spent and gone - 

Like the dead moon she still shines on.

R.T. Ketcham once said: 

""Attend church, but do not attend a church which prefers science to Scripture, reason for revelation, theories for truth, culture for conversion, benevolence for blood, goodness for grace, sociability for spirituality, play for praise, pep for prayer, profession for possession, progress for power, reformation for regeneration, good for God, speculation for salvation, jubilation for justification, feelings for faith, paralysis for peace, politics for precepts.""

To this I make additional comment saying that a church deserves to have Ichabod written from its lowest cellar step to the sky-touching point of its steeple which prefers the adulation of saints to ardent anxieties concerning lost sinners as well as abhorrence of that which is evil.

Glory yields up its scepter - when the fancies of literary notables have place along with the facts of the gospel, when there is the frivolity of the flesh instead of the fervor of the spiritual in serving the Lord - godliness in form only instead of glorying in the cross of Christ - a groping after eternal verities - and a guessing that only borders on godliness as to the certainties of God's promises instead of a guidance of others into paths of righteousness.

Glory ""packs its baggage for a one-way trip"" when in the church people are noted for faultfinding instead of being notable for forgiveness - when offense is quickly taken and there is overlordism instead of the offering of self for lowly service - when the making of money means more than the mastery of money.

How can the glory of the church be as a sunlit mountain whose position never changes when in the church there is playing at the job and little praying on the job - when peevishness and petulance predominate over praise - when there is quarrelsomeness instead of quietness - when there is frequent rumpus-raising and riotous revelry instead of restfulness, sinfulness instead of saintliness, selfishness instead of service, tattling instead of testimony, tampering with temptation instead of triumph over temptation.

""Thy glory hath departed ""will be written on earth and known in Heaven of the church where there is more yawning over watches than yearning over wanderers-where there is mere zest and not zealousness in good works. Let us so live and give, so love and serve, so watch and pray, that, if the individual's conduct were universalized, it would never be as a hand that writes of a church, ""Thy glory hath departed.""

The true glory of a church consists: ""in the purity of its members; in its spiritual progress; in the unity of its fellowship; in the spiritual children born into its household of faith; in its self-sacrificing spirit toward others; and in the prayer life of the whole group. When a church is in a healthy condition hypocrisy will be limited; progress in purity will be constant; strife and discord will disappear; sympathy for the lost will seek means for their rescue; recruits will outnumber the losses from backsliding, removal, and death; private devotion will be a pleasure, family religion a joy, and public worship a sought delight.""

Along with this let us remember that any church will undergo the frightful processes of dishonorable self- burial where there is a lax theology that advocates a mutilated Bible, a minimized sin, a deified man, a humanized Christ-substituting human opinions and speculations for the revealed pronouncements of God concerning the Bible, concerning the nature of men, concerning the terrors of sin, concerning the deity of Christ, concerning the meaning of Christ's death on the cross, concerning the plan of salvation, concerning Hell, concerning Heaven.

A Home May Lose Its Glory

Yet, glorious as the glory of a real home is, the glory can depart - sometimes does depart - assuredly will depart - if the things ""down under"" Christian ideals, sordidly below Christian standards for a home - get the upper hand and put their oppressive heels upon the virtues which would weave wedding garments instead of shrouds on the home loom.

Answer these questions: Are there not many homes that are polluted reservoirs from which muddy streams that carry deadly contamination flow? Are there not many homes that are grindstones on which the Devil sharpens his weapons of wickedness?

The glory of a home departs when parents walk on the edges of mental abysses - talking nonsense. The glory of a home will assuredly leave a home as a flower wilts under heavy frost - when parents, by neglect or omission in spiritual matters, send children out to sea in paper boats, as though seas did not drown, - when parents, in matters momentous as to issue in stainlessness of morals, permit children, in daring defiance of Christian conduct, to walk bare-footed on live coals, as though fire did not burn.

Today so many homes die in houses. Today many who know better, living for things that matter least, neglecting things that matter most, are content with houses in which there are no homes.

In pioneer days, wolves often attacked children. In remote mountain districts eagles did the same. Out West Indians attempted to destroy the home of settlers. On battlefields vultures have eaten the sons of women. Now vultures of evil literature attack our children. Now poisonous serpents are in every pathway they tread. Now the jackals of sex familiarity are fed by precept and example. Now the leaping leopards of lust; Now the vultures of infidelity in ministry and press; Now barnyard morality; Now demagogues who ravage the land; Now the buzzards of liquor traffic on every corner - permitted there by the United States Government; Now the theory of evolution in most schools - evolution, the antithesis of Christianity; Now modernism choosing the livery of Heaven to serve the Devil in; Now godless scholarship summoning the Bible to appear at the bar of human reason; Now all these infest our land.

All of which is to say that - no explorer amid the wilds of the North, no adventurer amid unexplored jungles, no doctor amid deadly contagions of disease - ever had to face as many dangers as our children of today face: their morals, their spiritual welfare, their mental wealth, their soul's salvation considered.

Parental delinquency makes glory depart from a home. Are we unfair to say that behind every delinquent child is a delinquent parent? Are we ceasing to tell the truth when we say that behind every broken youth is a broken home? Do we not speak words of truth when we say that behind every broken home is a neglect of God in that home?

When a fifteen-year-old unmarried girl, pregnant with child, stands before the court and states that she does not consider she has done wrong - no more than thousands of other young girls are doing - where are the mothers?

When a fourteen-year-old boy, apprehended for roaming the streets of a city at early morning hours, stands before the court with tears in his eyes and asks to be sent to the state school - because he knows he would be happier there than in his own home - where is the father?

When young girls smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and dress so skimpily they attract the attention of every goggle-eyed man and boy - do not their mothers the same?

When boys argue over the relative ""values"" and ""quick-stirring"" powers of advertised brands of liquor - do not their fathers drink booze and vote for legalizing it, forgetting that you can control a powder can in a fire as easily as you can control booze?

Is there not too much laxness on the part of parents toward spiritual values? Often children are allowed to stay out of Sunday School and to miss church services - to remain in almost complete ignorance of the spiritual values. Is it not perilous to children, this easy-come, easy-go attitude of parents? Is not the use of intoxicating beverages one of the greatest evils responsible for juvenile delinquency?

Are not children from homes where indiscriminate drinking is done sent out to ""play the game"" with two strikes against them? Do not thinking people believe that youth delinquency would be negligible if it were not for delinquent adults, especially delinquent parents? Can one pass judgment on these young people without indictment of ourselves for failure somewhere down the line?

Do not boys and girls get into trouble when too much leisure time is theirs?

Are not city governments extremely unwise to say they have no money for further improvement of playgrounds while they allot large sums of taxpayers' money for the cost of punishing the youth for committing crimes?

Is it not shortsightedness bordering on imbecility to pay so much for the cost of juvenile delinquency and so little for its prevention?

""Any law should be so framed to penalize the delinquent parent as well as the delinquent child . . . We must first give God his rightful place in the American home ... Until the cardinal principles of God are implanted in the hearts of the youth of our nation...until there is instilled in the hearts of the parents of these youth a God-like sense of responsibility in that home, we shall continue to experience wave upon wave of crime, mounting and growing steadily day by day, until it reaches a magnitude beyond the scope of the law-enforcement agencies and the American people to control.""

But if parents distinguish themselves by the profession of truth, the worship of God, the practice of virtue, they will be sure to draw others after them; whereas if they are irreligious and un-Christian, they are infested fountains that poison. Parents can no more dispense with personal piety without malicious influence on children than a tree can dispense with sap and bear fruit.

Adam and Eve sinned! And Cain became a murderer. Had they not sinned, Abel would have lived. If a rock is a quotation from the quarry, if a flower is a quotation from the garden, if a tree is a quotation from the forest, if a bird is a quotation from the flock, if every child is a quotation of his parents - what sort do the children make you?

Today the situation is desperate. Character is at a premium in the land. Criminality of all kinds is rampant. The daily prints are filled with record of deeds almost too revolting for public consumption.

An ever-rising wave of lawlessness is hurling its weight against the bulwarks of the nation. Much of this is because of godless homes-because too many fathers and mothers have abdicated.

How parents ought to rejoice for the opportunity of living close to God, of hearing the motion of angel's wings in the patter of little children, and of being Christlike in the home.

Glory in a home is made secure when Christian conduct is evident. Unless you serve God yourselves as parents you will plant vines on which will grow grapes of bitterness. ""What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? ""Ezekiel 18:2

Nothing is so infectious as example: ""We can do more good by being good than in any other way ""(Kingsley). ""A father who whipped his son for swearing and swore while he whipped him, did more harm by his example than good by his correction ""(Fuller). ""Noble examples stir us up to noble actions""(Burke). ""Live with wolves and you will learn to howl.""

A drinking or drunken father is a poor preacher of sobriety to sons. A proud father is a miserable recommender of humility to sons. They will do as you do rather than as you say. Your example will counteract all the effect of your counsel - and all the convictions you would fix in the mind will fall like arrows from an impenetrable shield. You should therefore begin ""both to do and to teach.""

You should be able, in a humble measure, at least, to say to those under your care: ""Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ..."" ""Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?"" Romans 2:21-23

If parents suffered their children to go naked, to beg their bread, to lie unattended in sickness, to perish with hunger in a ditch, they would be shunned as monsters. But parents act a far more criminal and a far more infamous part by disregarding their spiritual and everlasting welfare.

Doubtless Herod, after killing the infants in Bethlehem, was viewed and shunned with horror. But he was far less cruel than some modern parents. He only destroyed the body.

""But it any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, be hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. ""I Timothy 5:8.

Let us remember and teach others to remember - lest glory depart from our dwellings - that there is a difference in a house and a home: that a house is built by human hands but a home is built by human hearts, that a house is built of visible materials but a home is built of the invisible things of the Spirit; that a house may be destroyed, but fire and flood and earthquake and storm can not destroy a real home; that there is only one calamity can ruin a home, the death of love; that the real food of a home is not meat and bread but thoughtfulness and unselfishness.

The basis for Christianity in the home, the preventative of departed glory, is Jesus and the church.

Can there be a real Christian home without union with the church?

Can there be Christian homes without churchgoing as a habit as well as a duty and a privilege?

Jesus had the habit of churchgoing, for 'tis written: ""He was in the synagogue as was his custom on the Sabbath day.""

When I was a boy it was as natural to go to church on Sunday as it was to work on Monday or to play games on Saturday afternoon, but the present idea is that it is a terrible thing, a species of mental and physical punishment.

Dr. Macartney tells how when Grover Cleveland lay dying at Princeton, his mind reverted, not to any of the fierce political battles through which he had passed, nor to the presidential honors and burdens which he had borne, but to the old home in the Presbyterian manse, where his minister father at family worship prayed for the eternal salvation of his children.

The dying man asked that a copy of the hymnbook out of which they used to sing be procured, so that with its music and its memories he might face the eternal world. And then this great preacher says:

""All kinds of doctors are abroad today with all kinds of remedies for our national and social diseases. But a filled family pew in God's house on the Lord's day is the best thing that can ever happen to a family, a city, or a nation.""

An Individual May Lose the Glory

It is possible for an individual so to live that it can be said in earth and declared in Heaven: ""Thy glory has departed ""- as light departs from a lamp in which there is no oil, as fruitfulness departs from a tree wherein is no sap.

The old poet must have had some experience of this truth when he wrote:

I remember, I remember, 

But now 'tis little joy 

To know I'm farther off from Heaven 

Than when I was a boy.

What tragedy when ""Ichabod""- ""Thy glory hath departed ""- is written above and over a once- believing heart! What sorrow sufficient to make angels weep - when ""thy-glory-hath-departed ""is the autobiography of a life once faithful, once loyal, once devoted. What cause for grief when the life once a life of unselfish service becomes a life of stagnant selfishness - a life that centers in self. What tragedy for earth and man and God when the life once possessed of the fruit of the Spirit - ""love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, meekness, goodness, faith, self-control ""- is now a life in which is manifest the works of the flesh - ""adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envying, murders, drunkenness, reveling, and such like.""

Yet that you see, that you find, in the lives of some individuals who have gone from us - and in the lives of some who now live in our midst. So many who call themselves Christians have lost the old-time glow. With them the sacred fervor of other years is lacking.

Men and women there are who once believed in prayer and believed that we forfeit peace and bear needless pain because we do not carry everything to God in prayer; but now they are prayerless altogether or are weak in prayer and look upon it as a useless exercise.

People I know who, when they were young, believed the Bible to be the Word of God - infinite in scope, infallible in authority, regenerative in power, personal in application - who now say that it is a book of myths and allegories. Of them 'tis tragically true they have hewn themselves cisterns where no water is and have forsaken the fountain of living waters.

I know young people who have attended schools that once, in the days of our forefathers, were bulwarks for the most holy faith. Entering these schools they were believers in the miraculous and the supernatural, but now, deceived by the evil seducers who wooed and won them with strange and fantastic myths, they are adrift - without chart or compass.

From them the glory hath departed, even as it had departed from schools which serve the Devil in the livery of Heaven. Instead of believing the certainties of God's Word, they put their trust in the unscriptural surmises of men. Instead of feeding on God's Word, they have grown lean on the diet of quips given them by those who, calling themselves scholarly teachers, plant ""probabilities ""and ""perhapses"" and ""maybes"" or ""not-at-alls"" in the minds of youth.

Thus has glory departed from the teachers and from the taught. Thus has glory departed from the schools in which these teachers teach. The students so taught and the teachers who, like vandals, break into the house of their faith should realize that man's wisdom is to be laughed at.

How glory departs from an individual, or a multitude of individuals when they depart from the teaching of the supernaturalistic school, championed by orthodox Christians contending that Christ is the God-man - to line up with the materialistic school, championed by evolutionists.

Think of Judas - the incarnation of infamy today! Shakespeare called him ""the base Judean who sold a pearl richer than all his tribe."" Judas, given a great opportunity by Christ Himself, had part of ""the ministry and apostleship on which angels longed to serve."" Did not this position place its participant on a level with Moses and Elijah?

But the glory of this individual began to grow dim when he began to wonder about the course that Jesus chose in refusing the kingship and in antagonizing the rulers. The glory grew even dimmer when he began to worry about the future - and dimmer still when he began to pilfer the bag. And his glory departed completely when he went out into the night to bargain to betray Jesus for the price of a hog! Truly over it all you can write: ""Thy glory hath departed.""

And think of Lot - called just and righteous. ""And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day, with their unlawful deeds.) ""He was driven to Egypt when famine came, yet his soul in many ways became a famished soul. A businessman, an opportunist, maker of a bad choice that he thought was a good choice. He certainly added no brightness to manhood's torch by marrying a woman of Sodom - the wickedest city mentioned in man's literature, hopelessly corrupt. Lot escaped with only his family when God burned Sodom to the ground. Lot's last act was one of incest. From his daughters came the nations of Ammon and Moab.

And think of Saul - first king of Israel. His glory, which was as a burning bush of splendor, faded into lusterless cold ashes. Let us see what the Scriptures tell us: ""And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons. And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. Then said Saul unto his Armour bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me. But his Armour bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it ""I Samuel 31:2-4.

Again and again, with tragic repetition, do the pages of history testify that individuals who once gave light as steady stars came to the time and place where their light was the flame of a fluttering candle. In our churches we see people who once served faithfully who proved their kinship with Demas - to the hurt of some and to the sorrow of many. In some homes we have those who once held as sacred the marital vow who have gone as wild as the winds which know no barriers in making these vows perjury. 'Tis true that many know not, or, if knowing, give no heed to the truth that to leave Jesus out of life is to say good-by to glory. Against all things and against all evils that bring people to the place and time where they say good-by to glory,

I would that all men would take an unwavering stand remembering God's promise:

""And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee."" Jeremiah 1:19

1255,"With all of the discouraging news about global deforestation and the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, it’s good to know that people in many parts of the world are having great success at re-foresting planet earth.
• A planet in crisis: Here’s how you can help

In Bhutan, for example, when the nation was celebrating the birth of a new prince in 2016, people came together to plant 108,000 trees, which will become a new forest within a couple of decades. Ecuador set a world record in 2017 for planting a whopping 647,250 trees in a single day. Also in 2017, more than 1.5 million volunteers came together to plant 66 million trees in just 12 hours, setting another world record.
• WWF: Earth Has Lost 50% of its Wildlife in the Past 40 Years

Now, NASA is reporting that in the findings of a 20-year study of the earth, there are actually more trees today than there were two decades ago, thanks in large part to the efforts of countries and communities in India and China.

The findings are the result of 20 years of data collection from NASA instruments onboard two satellites orbiting earth.

A more detailed explanation from the study:

“Satellite data show increasing leaf area of vegetation due to direct factors (human land-use management) and indirect factors (such as climate change, CO2 fertilization, nitrogen deposition and recovery from natural disturbances). Among these, climate change and CO2fertilization effects seem to be the dominant drivers. However, recent satellite data (2000–2017) reveal a greening pattern that is strikingly prominent in China and India and overlaps with croplands world-wide. China alone accounts for 25% of the global net increase in leaf area with only 6.6% of global vegetated area. The greening in China is from forests (42%) and croplands (32%), but in India is mostly from croplands (82%) with minor contribution from forests (4.4%).“ [Source]

Furthermore, the news serves as a positive counter to the trend of pollution and environmental degradation we see today in Asia:

The satellites have recorded photos of the earth every day for 20 years, creating a massive data set that is allowing researchers and biologists to better understand how to preserve the world’s forests.

“This long-term data lets us dig deeper,” said Rama Nemani, a research scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center and a co-author of the new work. “When the greening of the Earth was first observed, we thought it was due to a warmer, wetter climate and fertilization from the added carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, leading to more leaf growth in northern forests, for instance. Now, with the MODIS data that lets us understand the phenomenon at really small scales, we see that humans are also contributing.”

The message is clear: if we come together we can easily remedy the ecological problems we have created here on earth. Let this good news serve as an inspiration to participate in the re-greening of earth. It also demonstrates how humans can address serious problems once they become aware of what’s really going on.

940,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Monday committed $10 billion of his fortune to set up a fund aimed at tackling the climate crisis, weeks after hundreds of his employees signed a blog demanding the online retail giant take drastic steps to reduce its carbon footprint.

The fund, named Bezos Earth Fund, will begin issuing grants to scientists and activists this summer, the world's richest man announced in an Instagram post. ""Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share,"" said Bezos, whose net worth is estimated to be $130 billion.

""This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth. It's going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals,"" he said.

Bezos' personal donation follows Amazon's ""Climate Pledge"" last year which aims to make the company carbon neutral by 2040. As part of the pledge, he had said Amazon would meet the goals of the Paris Agreement by the same year, 10 years ahead of schedule — also promising to buy 100,000 electric delivery vans.

The task of reducing its carbon footprint will be a challenging one for the world's largest e-commerce company which delivers 10 billion items annually. The huge energy consumption of server farms used by Amazon's cloud computing business further adds to its greenhouse emissions.

An advocacy group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, said it applauded Bezos' initiative but added that ""one hand cannot give what the other is taking away."" The group also questioned the company's support for oil and gas businesses.

""The people of Earth need to know: When is Amazon going to stop helping oil & gas companies ravage Earth with still more oil and gas wells... Will Jeff Bezos show us true leadership or will he continue to be complicit in the acceleration of the climate crisis, while supposedly trying to help?"" the group said in a statement.

889,"But Italy's education minister has big plans to make a radically green syllabus.

All children in Italy will have to study climate change at school starting from next year, becoming the first country in the world where this will be compulsory.

Italy's minister for education, Lorenzo Fioramonti, announced the decision on Wednesday.

As tensions on America's southern border rise, Joel Skousen predicts that America's dirty partnership with the Mexican drug cartels will ensure their longevity.

The decision will apply to all state-run schools in the southern European nation and will come into force from the start of the 2020 school year in September.

The lessons, which will also teach sustainable development, will be given to pupils from first grade through high school, from the ages of six to 19 years.

Speaking earlier to Reuters news agency, Fioramonti said all state schools would dedicate 33 hours per year, almost one hour per school week, to climate change issues.

""I want to make the Italian education system the first education system that puts the environment and society at the core of everything we learn in school,"" the lawmaker for the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement party said.

According to a report in UK newspaper The Telegraph the syllabus will be based on theUnited Nations' 17 sustainable development goals, including how to live more sustainably, how to combat the pollution of the oceans and how to address poverty and social injustice.

Traditional subjects such as geography, mathematics and physics, would also be studied from a green perspective.

Fioramonti has been a vocal supporter of green policies in government.

He drew criticism in September this year for encouraging students to miss class and attend the Fridays for Future climate protests.

His proposals for a plastic tax and sugary drink tax were also criticized, but they were presented to parliament for approval as part of the Italian government's 2020 budget this week.

890,"We can no longer ignore the damage our natural environment is experiencing. In 2018, scientists and leaders from across the world published a report showing how a 1.5°C increase in global temperatures from pre-industrial levels is devastating our environment. We are facing more extreme weather, food shortages, rising sea levels and mass extinction of plants and animals, to name a few impacts. The report below explains the undeniable link between human activities and this temperature increase. The report also calls for drastic changes in policy to prevent further damage to our environment.

Read the special report 'Global Warming of 1.5ºC' IPCC on the IPCC website.

In response, our Government has recommended a ‘net zero’ target for greenhouse gases. CO2 (carbon dioxide) is the main gas produced by human activities.

Find out more on the causes of climate change on the European Commission website.

Our Government recognises that, to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, we all need to change. The good thing is we already have the answers we need to tackle climate change and environmental degradation. All it takes is the will to act now.

Across the world the impacts of climate change are being felt in various ways. In some countries, we are seeing shifting weather patterns that threaten food production. Elsewhere, rapid glacier melt threatens sea level rise that risks catastrophic flooding. Currently the impacts of climate change are worse in poorer countries. Nonetheless, it is likely that climate change will increasingly affect the UK in years to come. Impacts it is likely we will see include:
• Very cold winters will be rare.
• Winters will be wetter and summers will be hotter and more prolonged.
• Sea level could rise by 40cm, leading to coastal erosion and flood risks.
• Temperature increase will change the crops we grow, impacting our diets.
• Changes in temperature will cause different illnesses, creating more problems for children and the elderly.
• Foreign diseases associated with hot weather migrating north, for example, Malaria.
• Cost of living to increase due to food, fuel and water shortages.
• Homes potentially damaged and insurance will increase due to severe weather.
• Domestic crops will begin to struggle due to weather change.
• Soil will be less fertile as we struggle to grow crops that no longer thrive.
• Some species cannot adapt to changes.
• The plants and trees that can grow will change.
• Dubbed as the “evil twin of climate change"".
• The ongoing decrease in ocean pH, 30% decrease so far.
• Predicted 150% by 2100 which has not been experienced for 400,000 years.
• Wide implications for ocean life, particularly animals with shells or skeletons.

While climate change is global in scale, Eden is no stranger to the impacts. The 2005, 2009 and 2016 floods had damaging impacts across the district. We have suffered social, economic and environmental losses. It is predicted similar flooding could become more common as temperatures increase.

In December 2015, Storm Desmond caused disruptions across Eden and Cumbria. It impacted homes and businesses for months after the event.

The Climate Change Act of 2008 was passed by our Government to ensure that we keep greenhouse gas emissions at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline by 2050, to avoid dangerous climate change. The Act made the UK the first country with a legally binding framework to cut carbon emissions. Alongside this Act, the Committee on Climate Change was set up to advise the Government on legislation and progress on reducing emissions. The UK has struggled to meet carbon targets set in this act, even though the need is getting stronger.

Climate change effects are being experienced in our country, which we now must adapt to.

Our experience of climate change has already created costs to our economy, society and environment. We must work to mitigate against climate change, as well as adapt to the impacts that we already experience.



Mitigation: reducing climate change

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions: energy efficiency, renewable energy, lower consumption rates, electric cars.

Enhancing our carbon sinks: planting trees and carbon sequestering plants, invest in carbon capture technology.

Adaptation: adapting to life with climate change

464,"Decades of schizophrenic warnings about global warming and ice ages are bogus.

With non-stop coverage of the latest doomsday doyenne the powers-who-should-not-be have strutted out on the stage, it’s easy to forget just how many times dire warnings have been issued about how the Earth’s climate was on the verge of wiping out all life on the planet.

For those of you fed up with the grating gyrations of Greta Thunberg (the troubled teenager being used by climate-change Chicken Little leftists like George Soros and Bill Gates), here are some nasty little facts the state-run media would love to keep under wraps.

A few months after The Wizard of Oz had its theatrical premiere in Green Bay, Wisc. in 1939, a newspaper headline appeared as follows: “Greenland’s Glaciers Melting, Says Scientist.” “All the glaciers in Eastern Greenland are rapidly melting, declared Prof. Hans Ahlmann, Swedish geologist,” the article screamed. “It may without exaggeration be said that the glaciers, like those in Norway, face the possibility of a catastrophic collapse,” Ahlmann crowed. They just love that word catastrophe, don’t they?

Seven-and-a-half years later, Ahlmann—feted and touted by those much smarter than us—was at it again, issuing his dire warnings: “The possibility of a prodigious rise in the surface of the ocean with resultant widespread inundation, arising from an Arctic climate phenomenon was discussed yesterday by Dr. Hans Ahlmann, a noted Swedish geophysicist at the University of California Geophysical Institute. A mysterious warming of the climate was slowly manifesting itself in the Arctic,” stated Ahlmann, who warned that “oceanic surfaces would rise to catastrophic proportions and people living in the [Greenland] lowlands . . . would be inundated.” It’s no mystery, Hans; it’s nature.

“Polar Ice Thaw Increasing: Glaciers Said To Be Melting,” said the headline. This time, Arctic expert Dr. William S. Carlson said that “the Polar icecaps were melting at an astonishing and unexplained rate and were threatening to swamp seaports by raising the ocean levels.” We’re still waiting, Bill.

Arctic explorer Adm. Donald McMillan was next to warn, stating, “There are now 6 million square miles of ice in the Arctic. There once were 12 million square miles.” Perhaps realizing their dire predictions were not panning out, the “experts” were no longer warning of global warming, but had switched to global cooling, and a coming ice age! You can’t make this stuff up.

The next expert trotted out was James P. Lodge Jr., a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. In an article titled “Scientist Predicts a New Ice Age by 21st century,” Lodge warned that “[a]ir pollution may obliterate the Sun and cause a new ice age in the first third of the new century.” Uh, Jim, can you pass me those sunglasses?

Things were so dire in the 1970s that two of the nation’s top geologists found it necessary to alert President Richard Nixon of the impending doom. “[A] global deterioration of climate, by order of magnitude larger than any hitherto experienced by civilized mankind, is a very real possibility and indeed may be due very soon. The present rate of cooling,” they warned, “seems fast enough to bring glacial temperatures in about a century, if continuing at the present pace.”

By now, most of the fake news media was on the bandwagon, running story after story on predictions of the coming ice age.

“An international team of specialists has concluded from eight indexes of climate that there is no end in sight to the cooling trend of the last 30 years, at least in the Northern Hemisphere,” squawked the nation’s “newspaper of record.”

The following year, “The Gray Lady” reversed course, predicting an Arctic meltdown, “blaming global warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions. . . . There is a real possibility that some people now in their infancy will live to a time when the ice at the North Pole will have melted, a change that would cause swift and perhaps catastrophic changes in climate.” There’s that word “catastrophic’ again.

Not yet synched to spew identical nonsense, the Chicago Tribune still thought global cooling was the way to go, and “reported” some more unfounded, dire warnings about a freezing planet. Toward the end of the 1980s, however, the global warming playbook was adopted by all in the fake news media, who have been constantly predicting polar icecap “melting on a catastrophic scale.” And of course, our good friends in the fake news media would never put the below in their fine papers or networks:

In a Sept. 24, Breitbart News Network headline, “500 Scientists Write UN: ‘There Is No Climate Emergency,’ ” the only news platform with some heft reported on the letter sent from the oft-overlooked “scientists and professionals in climate and related fields” to the United Nations, “asking for a long-overdue, high-level, open debate on climate change.” The two-page letter should have been splattered across the pages and screens of all the major media, but here’s why it wasn’t, as revealed by its main points:
• There is no climate emergency.
• Warming is far slower than predicted.
• CO2 is plant food, the basis of all life on Earth.
• Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warming of the Earth.

1037,"Global sport faces major disruption from climate change in coming decades, according to a new analysis.

By 2050, it's estimated that almost one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year.

But tennis, rugby, athletics and winter sports will also face serious challenges from the impacts of rising temperatures, the author says.

The study finds that sports leaders are, in the main, failing to address the issue seriously.

While the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life, many experts believe that this is just a dress rehearsal for the long-term impacts on sport of a world that's way too hot.

Extreme weather events, related to rising temperatures, have already disrupted some of the world's most high-profile sports in recent years.

A typhoon, which wreaked havoc in Japan last year, also affected fixtures at the Rugby Union World being held there.

Smoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this year.

These and many other instances are a foretaste of the future, according to this new study compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt.

As football slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050.

In the current Premier League, the home grounds of Southampton, Norwich, Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat.

Cricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places like India, Australia and the West Indies.

Venues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60% increase in days with temperatures over 40C over the next decade.

In golf, one in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels, the report says.

Researchers say that of the 19 venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics, just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050.

But as well as showing the likely impacts of climate change on sports, the new study also looks at the contribution that the sporting industry makes to carbon emissions.

The author says that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country like Bolivia at the low end but as large as a country like Spain on the high end.

The estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the global sportswear and sports broadcasting industries, who have impacts on carbon that are difficult to calculate.

Whatever the size of its carbon footprint, the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect change, says the author.

""Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single megacity, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total,"" said David Goldblatt.

""Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,"" he said.

While some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050, the majority of sports authorities have not.

The International Cricket Council is one of those who have not signed up.

Among winter sports, only the ice hockey and skiing federations have joined, ""which makes one wonder what the people in charge of luge and bobsleigh think they are going to be sliding on in the future,"" the report waspishly notes.

The report was commissioned by the Rapid Transition Alliance, a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to climate change.

""A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles,"" said Andrew Simms from the group.

""If players also speak out and say they believe clean air and a stable climate matter, millions more will see the possibilities for change. It will not only send a message of hope for the wider world, but it will help to guarantee a planet that is safe for sport.""",mainstream,M0f67a,climate.change
802,"Self-Declared Climate Change ‘Global Leader’ Mike Bloomberg Enjoys His Own Fleet of Private Jets, Helicopters

Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, worth an estimated $54 billion, enjoys his own fleet of private jets and helicopters stationed in New Jersey while describing himself as a “global leader” on the environment and climate change.

Bloomberg, who has pledged to end the American coal industry, has for years flown around the world to his multiple million-dollar mansions in the comfort of his own private jets and helicopters — ditching commercial flights and trains that working and middle-class Americans use to travel.

In 2012, the New York Times detailed how Bloomberg would jet to his $10 million Bermuda mansion in his $42 million Dassault Falcon 900 private plane about twice a month on the weekends while he was mayor of New York City:

Private jets have practically become de rigueur among the elite; everyone who is anyone either owns one or charters one regularly. Mayor Bloomberg is no exception: his trips to Bermuda aboard his private jet often fill in the blanks on weekends when he has no public schedule. [Emphasis added]

Inside Sources described in January how Bloomberg’s private jet likely “generates an estimated 37 times more carbon emissions than the same trip on a commercial flight.” As for Bloomberg’s $7 million AgustaWestland AW109, the helicopter “burns a jaw-dropping 72 gallons of fuel every hour,” according to the report.

48,"Jane Fonda is an American actress best known for her acting career, political activism and aerobic-exercise videos. The daughter of acclaimed actor Henry Fonda, the actress has won two Oscars.

Born Lady Jayne Seymour Fonda on December 21, 1937, in New York City, Jane Fonda has enjoyed a tremendous career as an actress. She comes from a Hollywood dynasty of sorts. Her father Henry was one of the top actors of the 20th century. Her brother Peter and her niece Bridget have also had their share of success on the big screen. Fonda faced some challenges growing up. Her father could be cold and distant. Her mother, socialite Frances Seymour Brokaw, committed suicide when Fonda was 12 years old. Not long after her mother's death, Fonda developed an eating disorder, which she struggled with for years. She attended boarding school and then went to Vassar College. Leaving college, Fonda went to Paris to study art. Fonda returned to New York and did a bit of modeling for a time. Before long, she decided to follow in her father's footsteps. In 1954, she co-starred with her father in a production of The Country Girl. Fonda began to study her craft with Lee Strasberg at the famed Actors Studio a few years later. Fonda's career seemed to really take off in 1960. She made her film debut in Tall Story (1960) with Anthony Perkins. On Broadway, Fonda netted a Tony Award nomination for There Was a Little Girl. She continued to juggle theatrical and film work over the next few years. Working with director George Cukor, Fonda starred in the romantic comedy The Chapman Report (1962). She shared the Broadway stage with Celeste Holm in Invitation to a March and Dyan Cannon in The Fun Couple around this time. In the late 1960s, Fonda recreated herself as a type of sex kitten under the direction of her French filmmaker husband Roger Vadim. This new look was most evident in the 1968 science fiction tale Barbarella. She soon shed this image for more serious dramatic roles. She scored her first Academy Award nomination for 1969's They Shoot Horses, Don't They? Two years later, Fonda took home her first Academy Award for her work on Alan J. Pakula's thriller Klute, which co-starred Donald Sutherland.

On the big screen, Fonda continued to deliver strong performances. She starred as playwright Lillian Hellman in Julia (1977) with Vanessa Redgrave. The following year, Fonda won her second Academy Award for the Vietnam War drama Coming Home with Jon Voight. She also starred in the hit thriller The China Syndrome (1979) with Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas around this time. Another significant role for Fonda came a few years later. She co-starred with her father Henry in On Golden Pond (1982). The film explores the dynamics of a family during a visit to their summer home. Art mirrored life in this case, with Fonda playing daughter to her real-life father. Katharine Hepburn also starred as Fonda's mother. The film gave her father his first and only Academy Award win as Best Actor. Around this time, Fonda also found herself spearheading a national health craze. She launched an immensely successful series of aerobic-exercise videos.

In 2005, Fonda made a dramatic return to the public eye. She appeared in her first film in almost 15 years with Monster-in-Law, which also starred Jennifer Lopez and Michael Vartan. That same year, Fonda published an autobiography, My Life So Far. More film roles followed, including playing the title character in the 2007 film Georgia Rule with Lindsay Lohan. Working on the small screen, Fonda landed a recurring role on the media-focused dramatic series The Newsroom in 2012. She also played former First Lady Nancy Reagan in the 2013 film The Butler. The following year, Fonda played the matriarch in the family dramatic comedy This Is Where I Leave You with Jason Bateman and Tina Fey. In 2015, Fonda teamed up with longtime friend Lily Tomlin for the series Grace and Frankie. The show looks at two women who work to rebuild their lives after their husbands fall in love with each other and leave them. Martin Sheen plays Fonda's husband, Robert, and Sam Waterston plays Tomlin's husband, Sol. That year Fonda also delivered a standout performance alongside Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel in Youth, earning a Golden Globe nomination for Supporting Actress. In addition to her acting, Fonda became an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War. She traveled to North Vietnam in 1972 — a visit that caused an uproar back at home. Many were particularly upset by Fonda's decision to pose for photos while sitting on an antiaircraft gun, one used to shoot at American troops. She was given the nickname ""Hanoi Jane"" and seen as a traitor for her support of the North Vietnamese. Fonda also fought for social causes, serving as a spokesperson on issues of civil rights and women's rights. Rededicating herself to activism, Fonda moved to Washington, D.C., in September 2019 to embark on a series of public protests to highlight the urgency of climate change. She was arrested multiple times as a result, often alongside famous friends like Waterston, Ted Danson and Catherine Keener. Fonda has been married three times — all of these unions ended in divorce. Her marriage to filmmaker Roger Vadim lasted from 1965 to 1973, and they had a daughter named Vanessa together. Then she married activist and politician Tom Hayden in 1973. They welcomed their son Troy Garity that same year. When Troy was a teenager, Fonda also unofficially adopted a young African-American girl named Mary Williams. Williams later wrote about her life with Fonda in the 2013 memoir The Lost Daughter. After divorcing Hayden in 1990, Fonda soon found love with media mogul Ted Turner. Married in 1991, the pair stayed together for a decade. The couple divorced in 2001, reportedly over Fonda's newfound Christian faith. She went on to date music producer Richard Perry for nearly a decade, until they split in 2017.",mainstream,M0fdba,climate.change
1075,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An Alaska law promoting fossil fuel development infringes on the constitutional rights of young residents to a healthy environment, a lawyer told Alaska Supreme Court justices on Wednesday.

A lawsuit filed by 16 Alaska youths claimed long-term effects of climate change will devastate the country's northernmost state and interfere with their constitutional rights to life, liberty and public trust resources that sustain them.

The state's legislative and executive branches have not taken steps to lower greenhouse gas emissions and adopted a policy that promotes putting more in the air, said attorney Andrew Welle of the Oregon-based Our Children's Trust group.

""This is an issue that is squarely within the court's authority,"" Welle said.

Assistant Attorney General Anna Jay urged justices to affirm a lower court ruling rejecting the claims. Ultimately, the climate change issues raised by Alaska youth must be addressed by the political branches of government, she said.

""The court does not have the tools to engage in the type of legislative policy making endeavor required to formulate a broad state approach to greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.

The 16 youths sued in 2017 and claimed damages by greenhouse gas emissions are causing widespread damage in Alaska. The lawsuit said the state has experienced dangerously high temperatures, changed rain and snow patterns, rising seas, storm surge flooding, thawed permafrost, coastal erosion, violent storms and increased wildfires.

Our Children's Trust is a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting natural systems for present and future generations. The group in 2011 unsuccessfully sued the state in 2011, claiming the state failed to adopt measures to protect young people from climate change.

The judge in that case concluded that courts lack scientific, economic and technological resources that agencies can use to determine climate policy and it was best left in their hands.

Alaska has no state sales or income tax and historically has relied on the petroleum industry, which extracts crude oil and sends most of it to West Coast Refineries, for much of its revenue.

Welle said state policy promoting fossil fuels, expressed in a state statute, should be declared unconstitutional because it harms young Alaskans by trading short-term financial gains for long-term health problems.

The lead client in the case, Esau Sinnok, has had his constitutional right to health and happiness denied by state policy and lack of action on climate change, Welle said.

""His home village of Shishmaref is literally wiped off the map because of climate change,"" Welle said before the hearing. ""It's endangering his culture, the very existence of his community, the health and safety of him and his community members.""

Justice Peter Maassen asked Welle if the energy policy was balanced by other policies in state law, such as protection for natural resources and the environment.

""How can we conclude that government agencies are following the energy policy blindly without consideration of these other policies?"" Maassen asked.

Welle said that while statutes provide authority to protect the environment, state agencies have been directed to systemically promote fossil fuels.

Justice Susan Carney called Welle's attention to a newspaper opinion piece by former Gov. Bill Walker in which he acknowledged severe economic effects of climate change.

""Isn't that a sign that state policy has balanced those concerns?"" she asked.

Welle replied that the court when assessing state policies, and their effects on fundamental constitutional rights, can assess the process, look at decisions and decide if balance struck is the most narrowly tailored choice.

1227,"For a preview of what's to come for the Earth's ecosystems, look to the past.

In a new study, an international group of researchers analyzed fossil records to track how the planet’s vegetation changed as Earth climbed out of the last ice age thousands of years ago. Then, the scientists used their data to predict how vegetation in the future — and everything dependent on it — will also change. [6 Unexpected Effects of Climate Change]

The planet is headed into uncharted territory, with ""no analog conditions"" in terms of climate, said study co-author Jonathan Overpeck, the dean of the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan. ""It makes it a lot harder for us to be sure what's going to happen next.""

The fossil records show that the world is very sensitive to temperature changes, which suggests that if fossil fuel emissions continue unabated, accelerated warming could lead to dramatic transformations in vegetation and ecosystems around the globe, the team wrote today (Aug. 30) in the journal Science.

Subsequently, that warming could lead to changes in the amount of carbon that plants can store, the available water supply and the global biodiversity that we depend on not only for a healthy, functioning ecosystem, but also for medicine, food and building materials, Overpeck told Live Science.

From the peak of the last ice age, 21,000 years ago, to the early Holocene epoch — the current geological age — the planet warmed by around 4 to 7 degrees Celsius (7 to 13 degrees Fahrenheit). If greenhouse gases aren't substantially reduced, the magnitude of warming that occurred over the course of 11,000 years following the end of the ice age will happen over a much shorter period: 100 to 150 years.

To decipher how plant life changed in the past, the researchers analyzed ancient pollen and plant fossils from nearly 600 sites on every continent except Antarctica. The investigators divided the changes they observed into two categories: compositional changes, or changes in plant species in the area, and large structural changes, like a tundra becoming a forest or a deciduous forest becoming an evergreen forest. The various changes were classified as ""large,"" ""moderate"" or ""low.""

Then, focusing on the sites with moderate or large changes, the scientists further classified the sites, this time addressing the role climate change could have played in the shifts. They used the same scale for the role of climate (low, moderate or large). In other words, the researchers sought to determine whether the large changes were due to climate change or the result of, for example, human activity or large animals.

The researchers found that the warming period after the last ice age played a large role in vegetation changes around the world. Areas that had the greatest temperature changes also tended to be those with the greatest vegetation changes, the study showed.

Indeed, the scientists found that warming temperatures largely changed the composition of the vegetation in 71 percent of the sites around the world and the structure of the vegetation in 67 percent of the sites; rising temperatures moderately changed the composition in another 27 percent of the sites and the structure in 28 percent of the sites.

The changes in plant life were most evident in mid to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as in southern South America, tropical and temperate southern Africa, the Indo-Pacific region, Australia, New Zealand and other countries in Oceania.

There were also some sites that showed very little compositional or structural change in vegetation, according to the paper. But nearly all sites with low compositional change also experienced low temperature changes.

This shows that our planet is highly sensitive to temperature changes, Overpeck said. Even if we end up curbing fossil fuel emissions and meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement, some change is still inevitable, but it would affect less than half the planet, he said.

In contrast, if we don't meet the Paris targets, ""then we'll have much wider change around the planet."" And that change will be much bigger and more difficult to predict.

Peter Verburg, a professor of environmental geography at the University of Amsterdam who was not part of the research, said that it's difficult to extrapolate the study's findings to the present day.

The study was ""based on paleo[lithic] conditions, and the present-day vegetation is incomparable [to the vegetation in those conditions] as human activities have changed land cover in some way in about 80 percent of the terrestrial surface,"" Verburg told Live Science in an email.

""Nevertheless, what we learn is that ecosystems are extremely sensitive to changes in climate,"" he said.

Indeed, the new study is ""another confirmation that climate change will hugely affect the Earth system and the ecosystems we depend on,"" Verburg said. In other words, it is yet ""another call for immediate action.""

Overpeck said that the results of this study likely underestimate the change that will happen in the future if we don't curb emissions.

""There are many reasons why these forests are going to have a rougher time [adapting to climate change] in the future than they had in the past,"" Overpeck said, but perhaps the major reason is that the time frame is sped up so significantly. That makes it a lot harder for the ecosystem to adjust.

And we're already seeing some changes in plant life today, Overpeck said. The warming of the planet is creating dryer ecosystems in certain parts of the world, like the western U.S., Australia and Eurasia. ""So what we're seeing in the western [U.S.] are whole regions of increased tree death because of warming and drying,"" he said.

""We are also seeing a big uptick in insect and disease in forests because these trees are being weakened by the warming,"" he added.",mainstream,M09b0e,climate.change
1269,"In 2018, a 30-minute documentary was premiered in San José, Costa Rica’s capital and my hometown. The film followed the early efforts of a handful of marine biologists who are fighting coral bleaching. They grow tiny bits of coral in underwater nurseries and once they’re big enough move them back to the reef, hoping to restore it.

Their pace is slow, possibly too slow to keep up with bleaching due to climate change. Warming waters swipe entire reefs in a matter of weeks. The biologists need months to nurture enough corals to restore a couple of square meters. Reef restoration seems like an impossible task, but they are relentless. It must be done to give corals a chance, so they are doing it.

It’s the same principle guiding young climate activists, atmospheric scientists and climate essayists. As author Rebecca Solnit wrote in 2016: “We don’t know what is going to happen, or how, or when, and that very uncertainty is the space of hope.”

I think of these dogged coral reef scientists whenever I’m asked, “What gives you hope?” in the context of climate change.

If there’s one environmental-advocacy organization that needs no introduction, it’s Greenpeace. The NGO has been around for much longer than “climate change” has been a commonplace phrase, lobbying heads of states and congresses around the world, and protesting for environmental causes on the open seas, since 1971. Its actions have received the scorn of the fossil-fuel industry, the nuclear industry, the whaling industry, many other industries, and those industries’ state allies. (The French government even admitted that its external intelligence agency, the General Directorate for External Security, used explosives to sink the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior in the Port of Aukland in 1985.)

Annie Leonard is the executive director of Greenpeace USA (the organization has 55 offices worldwide). Climate change is a major focus of her advocacy. “What am I personally doing about climate change? A lot of things, I’ll tell you. On an individual level, and also on a broader society-wide level, because that’s where we really see the impacts,” says Leonard.

“One of the things I’m doing is really investing in community,” says Leonard. She explains by fostering a strong sense of community with your immediate neighbors, you can better fight climate change. They share things to reduce their carbon footprints, for example, by borrowing ingredients from neighbors when baking a cake, instead of driving to the store for the one egg needed. Having a strong community “also helps build support and meaning and the resilience and security that we’re going to need to get through the climate crisis together, just like we’re seeing strong communities right now helping people get through the COVID crisis.”

Leonard also argues it’s important to focus on solutions, not just problems, to maintain a positive and achievable outlook on climate change. She explains, “People tell us, ‘Oh, that’s idealistic, you’re asking for unicorns.’ If you’ve seen solutions in action, you know that is not true. So it helps to make our commitment unshakeable.”

On a personal level, Leonard likes to grow her own vegetables, ride a bicycle, and rarely use disposable plastics, but maintains that “those aren’t going to scale at the level we need to drive broad, broad change.… Those are a great place to start, but a terrible place to stop.”

So where do we stop? “The single most important thing that we all have to do is stop burning fossil-fuels,” including oil, coal, and gas, which Leonard points to as the leading culprit for climate change. She also advocates for diverting public subsidies away from these industries, and to renewable energy (while taking care of communities and workers with a “just transition”). When it comes to fossil fuels: “No new permits, no new ports, no new pipelines.”

Leonard says the most important thing for individuals is to take action: “Find an organization or campaign that feels like a good fit for you. There’s so many to choose from. And contact them and ask how you can help. If you want to join Greenpeace, we’d love to have you involved.”",mainstream,M0e6c1,climate.change

Quote From the Announcement

Either directly or indirectly, Dr. Herndon is exposing the propaganda that is being spread by governments claiming that jet trails are ""contrails"". Global Skywatch has been actively working to open the public's eyes to this very harmful aerosol injection for years. In the announcement, Dr. Herndon says:

Climate models evaluated by the IPCC are based on the assumptions that: (1) Heat derived from the Sun is constant; (2) Heat derived from within the Earth is constant; and, (3) Anthropogenic contributions to atmospheric warming stem mainly from heat retention by CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Geophysical evidence of variable earthquake activity and geological evidence of variable submarine volcanism presented here indicate that heat added to the oceans is variable. The increasing occurrences of earthquakes of magnitudes ≥6 and ≥7 during 1973-2015 indicate volcanic activity is increasing and therefore Earth-heat, as well as volcanic CO2 additions, is increasing. Moreover, increased heat additions to the ocean act to decrease seawater solubility of CO2, ultimately releasing additional CO2 to the atmosphere. Furthermore, increasing submarine volcanic activity implies increasing ocean acidification, but data are insufficient to make quantitative estimates. The validity of IPCC evaluations and assessments depends critically upon due consideration being given to all processes that potentially affect Earth’s heat balance. In addition to the geological and geophysical processes discussed, the scientific community, including IPCC scientists, has turned a blind eye to ongoing tropospheric geoengineering that in recent years has been occurring on a near-daily, near-global basis. Tropospheric aerosolized particulates, evidenced as coal fly ash, inhibit rainfall, heat the atmosphere, and cause global warming. Evidence obtained from an accidental air-drop release indicates efforts to melt glacial ice and enhance global warming. By ignoring ongoing tropospheric geoengineering, IPCC assessments are compromised, as is the moral authority of the United Nations.

Evidence of Coal Fly Ash Toxic Chemical Geoengineering on the Troposphere: Consequences for Public Health

In this video, Dr. J Marvin Herndon exposes the evidence demonstrating that toxic substances are being sprayed into the atmosphere, and that at least some of these substances match the chemical footprint for toxic coal fly ash, which is known to contain heavy metals such as mercury, aluminum, lead, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, thallium, boron, antimony, barium, strontium, vanadium, beryllium, chromium, and cobalt.

Paper: Obtaining Evidence of Coal Fly Ash Content in Weather Modification (Geoengineering) Through Analysis of Post-Aerosol-Spraying Rainwater and Solid Substances

In January 2015, Dr. Herndon wrote a letter to the San Diego city council expressing his concern about chemtrails. This letter has been reprinted below.

January 16, 2015

 

 To: Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer, and San Diego City Council Members From: J. Marvin Herndon, Ph.D.

 

 Subject: Pervasive Toxic Aerosol Spraying of San Diego Residents

 

 I am a scientist (PhD in nuclear chemistry, Post-Doctoral in Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry) and businessman, and have lived in Scripps Ranch for thirty seven years. 

 

 Over the past year the skies above San Diego have changed drastically in plain sight. We’ve been robbed of the beautiful blue skies we associate with our city. Almost every day jet airliners are spraying innumerable so-called “chemtrails” and they persist after release behind the jets to gradually form clouds. Chemical clouds. Toxic clouds. They eventually diffuse and form a white haze in the sky. Sometimes, the artificial clouds are laid so thickly as to make the otherwise blue San Diego sky fully overcast with toxic chemical aerosols. Sometimes, depending on chemical mix, the transition from spray to white haze is rapid. Please see a few examples, attached, that I photographed from my front yard. 

 

 Chemicals sprayed into the atmosphere do not remain suspended; they fall to contaminate the air we breathe, our rainwater, and our agricultural soil. This ongoing massive spraying taking place over San Diego represents a grave threat to me and my family, my neighbors, and all my fellow San Diegans. Rainwater collected after intensive aerosol spraying now reportedly contains elevated levels of aluminum, barium, and strontium and likely other toxins. Aluminum is implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and autism, whose rising incidence is causing alarm to many Americans. How many additional children will be doomed to suffer a lifetime of autism? How many additional San Diegans will suffer premature brain degeneration or cancer? What horrors lie in store for our children and grandchildren who unknowingly play outdoors, or the pregnant women with their unborn offspring, or the runners and other outdoor recreationists? What about those of us who suffer asthma or who have compromised immune systems? What about the elderly? 

 

 What about your own family? Are we San Diegans no longer free to breathe uncontaminated air? 

 

 Why are San Diego’s Mayor and members of San Diego City Council silent about this imminent public health threat? Were you duped into believing that toxic chemical clouds will keep Earth from warming? Clouds might reflect sunlight back into space but those same artificial clouds also keep Earth from cooling by not letting Earth’s heat escape during the night. Clouds, artificial or natural, trap heat! 

 

 Why the silence? Are you afraid there will be demonstrations or riots in the streets if the truth were told about the ongoing activity that poisons the air San Diegans are now breathing? Deception by acquiescence and silence is fundamentally wrong, unless you are a willing participant in activities that will likely come to be characterized as crimes against humanity. 

 

 As elected officials you have the responsibility to advise and protect all San Diegans. Please speak the truth and stop this spraying over our homes.

 Please advise me of your intensions to make public disclosure of the chemical spraying over San Diego. Kindly respond before the close of business on January 23, 2015, or I will assume you have no intention of responding.

650,"As climate week at the United Nations kicked off, Fox Nation host David Webb had strong words on the issue, accusing the Left of ""turning climate change into their religion.""

""Climate change revision is the reformation of the new global warming cult. It's the religion of the Left,"" he said on his Fox Nation show ""Reality Check.""

Webb blamed the Left for ""scaring the younger generations"" in order to spread their ""climate change hysteria,"" and accused them of advocating for the wrong solution.

""They're easy to frighten, just tell them their world is ending... but do all these climate strikers know what they're protesting for? Seems the discussion is more often centered around [carbon dioxide] than the environment at large,"" he said.

The discussion should be focused on the environment as a whole, including the economic environment explained Webb, who accused the Left of focusing specifically on fossil fuels and ""other clever buzzwords.""

""Our environment is everything around us including and importantly, our economic environment. We have to be able to afford the things we want to do,"" Webb said.

Webb also threw jabs at the highly contentious Green New Deal. ""After all it's the big New Green Deal, which isn't the real deal, and America the prosperous is the Satan. Hey, every religion needs a Satan,"" Webb said.

""What if I told you,"" Webb continued, ""that there is a clean, capitalist, conservative approach to help our environment founded on conservative principals,"" he asked.

Later in the episode, Webb sat down with a panel of experts to explore the ""conservative approach"" as they tackled one of the largest issues surrounding American politics today.

51,"OFFICIAL death records are not reflecting the actual amount of deaths caused by the climate crisis, according to a new study.

A team of Australian health experts claim there is a ""substantial under-reporting of heat-related mortality"".

Excessive heat is said to be the most dominant risk posed by climate change in Australia.

However, experts from The Australian National University claim that deaths attributed to heat are ""at least 50 times more"" than what is stated on official death certificates.

Dr Arnagretta Hunter, from the ANU Medical School, said: ""Climate change is a killer, but we don’t acknowledge it on death certificates.

""There is second component on a death certificate which allows for pre-existing conditions and other factors.

""If you have an asthma attack and die during heavy smoke exposure from bushfires, the death certificate should include that information.""

The researchers want death certification to be modernised so it can reflect large-scale environmental events.

Over the past 11 years, official figures are said to show 340 deaths in Australia were attributed to excessive heat.

However, statistical analysis has found that the real figure could be as high as 36,765 deaths.

Dr Hunter said: ""We know the summer bushfires were a consequence of extraordinary heat and drought and people who died during the bushfires were not just those fighting fires – many Australians had early deaths due to smoke exposure.""

The study authors argue that climate change deaths need to be recorded properly so that the true scale of the crisis can be understood.

They say this is imperative for many countries all over the world.

This year has already seen raging wildfires in Australia, which were said to be fuelled by high temperatures.

Last year also saw the devastating impact of the fires along with those in areas like California and even the Arctic.

The hottest June ever recorded on Earth saw huge wildfires spreading from Greenland to Siberia to Alaska.

Hot, dry weather combined with drought and strong winds create the perfect conditions for fire to spread quickly.

The Australian bushfires resulted in the loss of over half a billion animals.

This research was published in The Lancet Planetary Health.

1100,"In coastal Antarctica, some snow isn't white — it's green. And while small amounts of the green snow have been visible for years, it's starting to spread across the continent because of climate change.

According to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications, the vibrant color is caused by microscopic algae blooming across the surface of the snow. Using satellite data and fieldwork observations, a team of researchers at the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey have created the first large-scale map of the green algae and predicted the future spread of the bizarre snow.

Green snow appears along the Antarctic coast, growing in ""warmer"" areas, where the average temperatures reach just above freezing in the summer. Although the individual algae are microscopic, when they grow at scale, the green snow can even be seen from space.

For the study, the team combined on-the-ground research from two summers in the Antarctic Peninsula with images from the European Space Agency's Sentinel 2 satellite taken between 2017 and 2019. In total, the team identified over 1,600 separate algal blooms on the snow surface.

The team found that the distribution of green snow algae is strongly influenced by marine birds and mammals, because their excrement works extremely well as fertilizer. Over 60% of blooms were found near penguin colonies, and others were found near birds' nesting sites.

""This is a significant advance in our understanding of land-based life on Antarctica, and how it might change in the coming years as the climate warms,"" lead author Dr. Matt Davey of the University of Cambridge said in a press release.

If bird populations are strongly affected by climate change, as they likely will be, the algae could lose key sources of nutrients. But the results of the study indicate that green snow will massively spread as global temperatures rise.

That's because in order to flourish, the organisms need an available supply of water. Temperatures on the peninsula where the green snow is found have risen dramatically in recent decades, increasing the amount of water available.

As the planet warms and more of Antarctica's snow melts, the algae will spread, the scientists said. And while some algae will be lost to areas that lose snow altogether, much more will be gained.

""As Antarctica warms, we predict the overall mass of snow algae will increase, as the spread to higher ground will significantly outweigh the loss of small island patches of algae,"" said co-lead author Dr. Andrew Gray, of the University of Cambridge and the University of Edinburgh.

It's unclear how the spreading algae will affect the planet. It plays a key role in cycling nutrients and pulling carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, Davey said, but also darkens snow, and absorbs more heat from the sun.

The amount of algae found by the team creates a carbon sink that absorbs about 500 tons of carbon each year, the equivalent of about 875,000 average car journeys in the U.K., researchers said.

The amount of algae found is actually a conservative estimate, because the satellite was only capable of picking up green algae, missing its red and orange counterparts. ""The snow is multi-colored in places, with a palette of reds, oranges and greens — it's quite an amazing sight,"" Davey said.",mainstream,M0c706,climate.change
554,"In recent years, climate change has loomed like a dark specter over the globe, contributing to everything from gentrification in Miami to refugees fleeing drought and crop shortages in Guatemala. But the urgency around the issue reached new heights in 2018 when the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated that rapid, ""far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"" would be needed in order to drop carbon dioxide levels by 2030 and prevent catastrophic global warming.

Scientists have indeed proposed drastic measures — just not in the way that you might think. In the same IPCC report, the U.N. suggests that adding 2.5 billion acres (1 billion hectares) of forest to the world could limit global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) by 2050. In other words: Responding to climate change will require planting new trees. A lot of them.

And now, the U.N. might just have the data to back up their proposal.

In a recent study, unveiled July 5, 2019 in the journal Science, a group of researchers associated with the Crowther Lab in Switzerland found that global tree restoration to the tune of 223 million acres (900 million hectares) of canopy cover — an area that's approximately the size of the U.S. — is ""our most effective climate change solution to date."" These trees would store 205 billion tons (186 metric tons) of carbon, or roughly two thirds of the carbon that has been emitted ""as a result of human activity since the Industrial Revolution,"" according to a press release. Although some news reports have said this much forest restoration is the equivalent of roughly 1 trillion trees, this statistic is actually linked to an estimate from an older 2015 study.

Jean-François Bastin, the Crowther Lab's study lead author, breaks down their 2019 analysis by email. ""The idea was to estimate what tree cover could be expected when you removed the 'human factor,' i.e. what specific types of forest would naturally occur in the absence of other development, and where,"" he says. Bastin and his team used a form of artificial intelligence known as ""machine learning"" to build ""a model to link tree cover with climate/soil/topography, based on 78,000 observations of tree cover in protected areas.""

The researchers then projected the data further to estimate the ""total potential tree cover of the planet,"" Bastin explains. Afterward, the team excluded land currently being used for urban settlements, croplands and existing forests, which yielded the total amount of land available for restoration. The study includes a map showing how much tree coverage different parts of the globe can support; the top three areas include Russia, Canada and the U.S.

In many ways, the study's timing couldn't be more perfect, as it aligns with current global efforts around ecological restoration. One example is the Trillion Trees Vision, which seeks to restore 1 trillion trees by 2050. Another is the Bonn Challenge, which is a partnership between the government of Germany and the U.N.'s International Union for Conservation of Nature that aims to restore 371 million acres (150 million hectares) of deforested land by 2020.

You might be thinking, well, that sounds pretty easy. Let's all roll up our sleeves and save the planet by planting one tree at a time — right? But some experts say the situation is actually a little more complicated than that rosy picture. Especially if most nations don't chip in to help.

""Implementation of forest restoration on the scale discussed in this paper is not as straightforward as it might seem,"" says Jim Hallett, chair of the board of directors for the Society for Ecological Restoration. ""By 2018, there were commitments of over 420 million acres (170 million hectares) by 58 nations, which exceeds the Bonn Challenge goal. Current estimates indicate that around 29 percent of the committed lands are now under restoration, but most of this work has been done by a few countries.""

Hallett cites major challenges to implementing restoration on such a global scale, ""including financing, governance, land tenure and ownership, [and] capacity to do the work."" Hallett concludes, ""there is ample evidence that, in some contexts, if the benefits of restoration are not equally shared, the project will fail. So incentive programs have to be carefully developed.""

Although Hallett agrees that forest restoration is important to addressing climate change, restoration alone will likely not be enough. It takes time, after all, to implement such big restoration projects and also for these trees to store carbon. And Hallett stresses that ""the possibility of future restoration should not be used as an excuse for degrading intact lands.""

Other scientists question not only the practicality of the study's claims, but also the study's very methodology. ""Many of the allegedly available restoration areas are clearly unsuitable for more trees than they currently support. If you look closely at the map, a large proportion of these areas are in regions where soils are permanently frozen,"" says Eike Luedeling, a climate change researcher and professor of horticultural sciences at the University of Bonn.

Luedeling continues, ""The methodology implicitly (probably not on purpose) implies that carbon stock is proportional to canopy cover, i.e. ecosystems without trees contain no carbon. This is clearly false and strongly inflates the global estimate [of restoration].""

Jan Börner, Luedeling's colleague and a professor for economics of sustainable land use at the University of Bonn, is similarly skeptical. Börner says that some areas being proposed for restoration under the current study are already in use for other purposes. Börner considers the study to be an ""interesting academic exercise ... but as a [climate change] mitigation strategy proposal (and it is being advertised as such!), it sends a misleading signal to the international climate policy debate.""

But don't fret just yet. Both Bastin and Hallett emphasize that the U.N. has declared 2021 to 2030 the ""Decade on Ecosystem Restoration,"" which could spur nations to act quickly — and some countries are already tackling the initiative head on. And, according to Hallett, forest restoration boasts far more perks than just impacting climate change, including maintaining — or even increasing — biodiversity and preserving the ecosystem that we humans rely upon for our food and water.

But even the study's authors acknowledge that it's going to take a lot of goodwill to make this grand vision a reality.

""What we need is universal action: international agencies, NGOs, governments, all citizens — anyone can be involved,"" says Bastian. ""Local communities and small organizations may be especially effective. While they do not have the same reach as national agencies, they have the benefit of knowing what works best in their own backyards.""

175,"Scenario in which human civilization experiences catastrophic events due to climate change

A climate apocalypse (also called a climate dystopia and a climate-induced collapse, among other names) is a hypothetical scenario involving the global collapse of human civilization and potential human extinction as either a direct or indirect result of anthropogenic climate change and ecological breakdown. Under a global catastrophe of this scale, some or all of the Earth may be rendered uninhabitable as a result of extreme temperatures, severe weather events, an inability to grow crops, and an altered composition of the Earth's atmosphere.[1]

Although there is consensus on the attribution of recent climate change to human activity,[2] and concern about future tipping points and feedback loops, there is no consensus on the likelihood of climate-induced collapse.[citation needed]

Rhetoric and belief centered on apocalypticism has deep roots in religious contexts, and similar rhetorical approaches undergird secular apocalyptic interpretations of climate.[3] Historical interpretations fall into two visions of apocalypse: the tragic and the comic. Tragic apocalypticism frames a clearly divided good and evil, with preordained events. In contrast, comic framing emphasizes flawed human agency, and it tends to be characterized by an open-ended, episodic, and ongoing timeline.[4] Some of the most significant books in environmentalism make use of either the tragic or comic apocalyptic framing: Carson's Silent Spring (1962), Ehrlich's The Population Bomb (1972), and Al Gore's Earth in the Balance (1992).[5]

There is no single agreed term used to describe an environmental and ecological collapse as either a direct or indirect result of anthropogenic climate change, however such an event has been explored in both fiction and non-fiction for many years. Jules Verne's 1889 novel The Purchase of the North Pole imagines climate change due to a deliberate tilting of Earth's axis.

Since World War II, there has been continual discussion of environmental destruction due to nuclear war.[6][7]

There is a Western world tradition of describing a climate apocalypse with images and descriptions of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and other features of the apocalypse of the Christian faith.[8][9][10][11][12]

Global warming reduces the capacity of the oceans to absorb oxygen. Biomarkers and geologic evidence suggests that oxygen-deprived oceans resulting from high carbon dioxide concentrations may have contributed to the five previous mass extinction events in Earth's history. Geoscientists have found that anaerobic microbes would have thrived in these conditions and produced vast amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas. Hydrogen sulfide is toxic, and its lethality increases with temperature. At a critical threshold, this toxic gas would have been released into the atmosphere, causing plant and animal extinctions both in the ocean and on land. Models suggest that this would also have damaged the ozone layer, exposing life on Earth to harmful levels of UV radiation. Deformities found in fossil spores in Greenland provides evidence that this may have occurred during the Permian extinction event. At the end of the Paleocene and Triassic eras, mass extinctions occurred at carbon dioxide concentrations of around 1,000 ppm. If these concentrations were reached again in the future, either as a result of anthropogenic or naturally occurring greenhouse gas emissions, it is possible that such an event could be repeated.[13][14]

Rising temperatures increase the risk of an epidemic or pandemic. As the climate changes, distributors of infectious diseases such as mosquitoes and ticks spread to new areas and transmit illnesses to regions which may not have experienced them otherwise. Epidemics are also made more likely after severe weather events, such as heavy rainfall or flooding. Food scarcity may lead some communities to a more meat-based diet, which raises the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as ebola. Melting permafrost also threatens to release diseases that have been dormant for many years, as was the case in August 2016 when a thawed reindeer carcass that was almost a century old infected several individuals in Siberia with anthrax.[15]

Many plants have a maximum temperature at which they can grow, and climate change may mean that new pests are introduced to areas where it was too cold for them to survive before. Extreme weather events and more frequent droughts will also affect crop production as the Earth approaches and surpasses 2°C (3.6°F) above pre-industrial levels.[16] A global decline in food availability could lead to severe impacts on public health. If the Earth's temperature increases to 2°C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, some models predict that global food availability would be 3.2 percent lower than if no climate change occurred, resulting in an additional 529,000 deaths worldwide.[17][18]

The combination of heat and humidity can impair the human body's ability to cool itself, leading to hyperthermia, a potentially life-threatening condition. A 2017 review considered research over past decades and predicted that under the high-end RCP 8.5 scenario given in the 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (which predicts a 3.2°C-5.4°C (5.76-9.72°F) increase in global average temperatures by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels), by 2100, around 73.9% of the human population would live in environments of lethal heat illness for routine human life, compared with around 30.6% in 2000.[19][failed verification]

As regions become too hot to inhabit or grow crops, as water becomes more scarce, as sea levels rise and as extreme weather events grow more frequent and more severe, it is likely that more people will be displaced from their homes, which could result in social instability and conflict when these people move to new areas.[1]

According to the 2019 Global Report on Internal Displacement by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, 61% of all new internal displacement in 2018 was caused by natural disasters, totalling 17.2 million people.[20] Some predict that as the number of migrants from poorer nations increases, wealthier nations will impose higher restrictions on immigration and governments will become increasingly authoritarian and populist. Some areas, such as Europe, are more vulnerable to the stresses of increased migration as a result of their geographical location as well as diplomatic relations with bordering nations.[21]

The Earth is currently undergoing its sixth mass extinction event as a result of human activity. During the Permian–Triassic extinction event 250 million years ago, the Earth was approximately 6°C higher than the pre-industrial baseline. At this time, 95% of living species were wiped out and sea life suffocated due to a lack of oxygen in the ocean.[1] During the previous mass extinction around 66 million years ago, an asteroid or comet is predicted to have collided with the Earth, drastically altering the planet's climate and wiping out the dinosaurs as well as around 75% of all plant and animal species on the planet.[22]

Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including droughts, storms and flooding. Although it is not possible to determine whether or not a specific natural disaster occurred because of climate change, it is possible to state how much more likely a natural disaster was as a result of climate change.[23]

As temperatures increase, glaciers and ice sheets melt and the ocean expands which causes a rise in sea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 23 cm since 1880 and are currently rising at around 3.2 mm each year.[24] It is difficult to predict amounts of sea-level rise over the next century, although the ice sheets are melting earlier than predicted which makes a high-end scenario of 2 metres of sea-level rise by 2100 increasingly plausible.[25] If the entire Greenland ice sheet were to melt, the world's oceans could rise by more than 6 metres.[26] In the past, at times when the Earth has been 6°C above the pre-industrial baseline, sea levels were 20 metres higher than today.[1] If all the ice on land and at the poles melted, sea levels would rise by more than 65 metres.[26] Rising sea levels result in forced migration and threaten services like the Internet, since much of the Internet's key infrastructure is built near coastlines and is not built to be permanently submerged in water.[27]

Abrupt climate changes have occurred in the past, most clearly recorded in climate records from glacial ice on Greenland. There have been several explanations put forward for these changes, but the prevailing paradigm is that these changes were a result of changes in ocean currents, specifically the northward transport of heat by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). One example of this is the Younger Dryas, in which a rapid decline in temperature, recorded in Greenland as a drop of 4 to 10°C (7.2 to 18°F) over just a few decades, is thought to have been caused by the melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet providing extra freshwater to the North Atlantic and interrupting the AMOC.[28]

It is believed that recent climate change has caused a 15-20% slowing of the Gulf Stream, a current which transports warm water from the Gulf of Mexico towards north-west Europe, due to a melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet resulting in large amounts of freshwater pouring into the North Atlantic.[29] Although it is likely to continue to slow, it is unproven whether the Gulf Stream could come to a complete halt this century, if ever. However if it does, this would have profound impacts upon large parts of the Earth's climate. In the UK, for example, temperatures would drop by an average of 3.4°C (6.1°F) and more so in Scotland. Rainfall during the growing season would also drop by 123 mm. This would reduce the UK's arable land from 32 percent to just 7 percent and it is uncertain if there would be enough water to offset this through irrigation, resulting in food shortages.[30][31]

Research has shown that aside from worsening income inequality and the strain of an increased population exceeding the carrying capacity of an environment, another important factor which may lead to global collapse is ecological strain. Climate change increases the strain on the planet's ecology, especially in terms of resource depletion.[32]

Climate change has contributed to the collapse of civilisations in the past. A 200-year drought caused cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation to be abandoned; the Khmer Empire collapsed as a result of successive droughts and monsoon floods which led to political and social unrest; and a period of cooling called the Little Ice Age made it more difficult for Vikings to farm in Greenland, which was one of the reasons that they were forced to abandon their settlements.[26]

More recently, a severe drought in the late 2000s which is likely to have been intensified by anthropogenic climate change contributed to failing agricultural production in Syria, leading to high unemployment, large amounts of internal displacement, heightened ethnic tensions and increased violence. Poor governance and neoliberal economic policies also contributed to the resulting civil war and societal collapse in 2011.[32]

Although the entire planet is affected by climate change, the worst impacts will be felt by the world's poorest countries, and these countries are both more likely to face the effects of societal collapse and more likely to face such effects sooner. This is one of the moral issues described within the climate justice movement of climate change activism.[32]

As societal collapse becomes more likely, it is possible that denial and anti-intellectualism will increase as well, or that people will assign blame for the crisis on communities other than their own. As localised violence increases, societal collapse also becomes more likely.[32]

The risk of global conflict, especially in more vulnerable regions, rises with global warming. Studies have shown that extreme weather events can damage economies, lower food production and raise inequality, which can increase risks of violence when combined with other factors. One study found that climate change has influenced between 3% and 20% of armed conflict in the last century, that an increase of 2°C above pre-industrial levels more than doubles the current risk of conflict, increasing it to 13%, and that an increase of 4°C multiplies the risk by five, up to a 26% risk.[33]

A report by the Global Peace Index found that 971 million people lived in areas with either a high or very high climate change exposure and that 400 million of those people lived in countries with low levels of peacefulness. It warned that climate change can increase the likelihood of violent conflict by impacting upon resource availability, job security, and by causing forced migration.[34][35]

Scientists struggle to reach a consensus on the likelihood of war as a result of climate change as future climate change is likely to be very different from what humanity has experienced previously and the ability of societies to adapt is unclear.[33][36]

Large-scale changes to the Earth system such as tipping points and possible abrupt climate change are usually not included in climate models and impact assessments.[37] This means that many scientific reports, including the IPCC Assessment Reports, have often underestimated the impacts of climate change effects.[38]

Climate scientists may also downplay potentially disastrous scenarios in favor of more restrained predictions that are less likely to be rejected as alarmist or fatalist.[38] Discussions of 'tail-end' risks of temperatures rising beyond 3°C (5.4°F) are also often neglected in research more generally.[39]

Current levels of global warming are often calculated in terms of the global average increase in the Earth's temperature compared with levels prior to the Industrial Revolution. In 2016, the Earth is likely to have reached 1.1°C (1.98°F) above pre-industrial levels.[40] The rate of global warming is influenced by the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, which has so far led to a linear increase in global warming. However global warming is non-linear, and is subject to acceleration when certain tipping points are crossed in the Earth's climate system, or as atmospheric pollution disappears from the atmosphere. These may also lead to abrupt climate change. As of December 2019, current global climate policies could take the planet to between 2.3°C and 4.1°C (4.14-7.38°F) above pre-industrial levels by 2100, while current pledges and targets would take the planet to between 2.3°C and 3.5°C (4.14-6.3°F).[41]

If all of the fossil fuels on Earth were burned, lower-end estimates calculate that 5 trillion tonnes of carbon emissions would be released into the atmosphere, resulting in a possible 10°C of warming relative to 1986-2005 by the year 2300.[42][43]

It is more likely that the Earth will cross tipping points and/or trigger abrupt climate change as it approaches and surpasses 2°C above pre-industrial levels.[37] Some of these tipping points may lead to accelerated global warming and runaway climate change. In the event that warming is limited to 2°C by 2100, these carbon cycle feedbacks could still cause an additional 0.24-0.66°C (0.432-1.188°F) of warming by that year. These tipping points could be triggered much earlier, and could continue to warm the planet for hundreds or even thousands of years.[44]

During the 1950s and 60s, scientists determined that the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth had dropped. This was labelled the global dimming effect and has since been proven to have a strong relationship to atmospheric pollution, the particles of which directly absorb energy from the sun before reflecting it back into space. This has many impacts including the cooling of the Earth and oceans leading to lower rainfall and more droughts. These pollutants also lead to the formation of smog and acid rain and cause various respiratory diseases. Global dimming may also cause heat waves and runaway fires, while the decrease of sunlight negatively impacts plant growth, endangering animal populations.[45]

As carbon emissions are reduced and the amount of pollution in the atmosphere disappears, the most widely credited studies indicate that there will be an increase of about 0.5°C in global average temperature, however some studies have indicated that up to 1.1°C is possible.[46][45] Some solutions to this dilemma would be to use natural geoengineering solutions such as mass rewilding and biochar alongside a reduction of carbon emissions. Other potential solutions could be much more dangerous and unpredictable, such as artificially injecting additional sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere.[47] This could lead to disproportionately negative impacts on certain regions over others, causing droughts, flooding or desertification.[48]

A paper published in the journal PNAS in August 2018 entitled ""Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene"" described a threshold which, if crossed, could trigger multiple tipping points and self-reinforcing feedback loops that would prevent stabilization of the climate, causing much greater warming and sea-level rises and leading to severe disruption to ecosystems, society, and economies. It described this as the ""Hothouse Earth"" scenario and proposed a threshold of around 2°C above pre-industrial levels, arguing that decisions taken over the next decade could influence the climate of the planet for tens to hundreds of thousands of years and potentially even lead to conditions which are inhospitable to current human societies. The report also states that there is a possibility of a cascade of tipping points being triggered even if the goal outlined in the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5-2.0°C (2.7-3.6°F) is achieved.[44]

Even in mid-range scenarios of around 3°C above pre-industrial levels, extreme weather events, large-scale loss of agricultural land and freshwater sources, and collapsing ecosystems could lead to widespread suffering and instability and over a billion people who currently live in major coastal cities would need to be relocated due to sea-level rise. One report published by the Global Challenges Foundation wrote that the potential destruction of high-end scenarios are beyond their capacity to model, but that there is a high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end. The report states that we are currently in a position where we can reduce the risk of civilization collapse due to climate change, and possibly avoid it.[39]

Although runaway climate change may be triggered at 2°C or even lower, societal collapse in different regions may not happen until later, although there is no consensus as to when this may happen. Some scientists and institutions such as the World Bank have argued that it is uncertain whether adaptation to a 4°C world is possible, and that such an increase in temperature is incompatible with an organised global community.[37][38][49]

Grist advised that although some people describe an expectation of a horrible Climate Apocalypse, the effects of climate change could be lessened or worsened depending upon when a coordinated response to lessen the damage develops.[50]

KQED reported that the scientific consensus is to take whatever action possible, wherever possible, even when there are reports of a coming Climate Apocalypse.[51]

Scientists commenting in The Atlantic said that the Representative Concentration Pathway was an important measurement to watch, and that as of 2018 this measurement predicts a worst-case scenario for the world.[52]

Stratospheric aerosol injection, a hypothetical process for blocking sunlight from the earth, is proposed as a desperate technological response to reduce existential risk.[53]

What if we stopped pretending?

An article written for The New Yorker by Jonathan Franzen in September 2019 argued that those under the age of sixty at time of publishing were likely to see the radical destabilization of life on earth due to crop failures, fires, crashing economies, flooding, and hundreds of millions of climate refugees, while those under the age of thirty were almost certain to see it.[54] The article attracted huge controversy for arguing that humanity must now accept that a climate apocalypse is inevitable, and was heavily criticized for being defeatist, as well as for drawing false scientific conclusions that such a scenario was inevitable, rather than possible.[55][56]

A report published in November 2007 by various authors including former director of the CIA R. James Woolsey Jr., former national security advisor to Al Gore Leon Fuerth, and former chief of staff for President Bill Clinton John Podesta entitled ""The Age of Consequences: The Foreign Policy and National Security Implications of Global Climate Change"" describes both a ""severe"" and a ""catastrophic"" scenario in which global warming reaches 1.6°C (2.88°F) above pre-industrial levels by 2040 and 5.6°C (10.08°F) by 2100 respectively.[57]

In the ""severe"" scenario, nonlinear climate change has devastating impacts on society including a possible pandemic; societal instability due to large increases in migration and food and water shortages; threatened identities of global communities as a result of rising sea levels and coastal flooding; likely conflict over resources and possible nuclear war. The authors write that in this scenario climate change causes humanity to undergo a permanent shift in its relationship to nature.[57]

In the ""catastrophic"" scenario, the authors write that human society would struggle to adapt, and note that this scenario is so extreme that its impacts are difficult to imagine. The authors encourage readers to compare the scenario to the threat of terrorism, emphasising that the solution to both threats relies on a transformation of the world's energy economy.[57]

In May 2019, Breakthrough - National Centre for Climate Restoration released a report which argued that climate change represents an existential threat to human civilisation in the near to mid-term, calling for a wartime level of response to combat it.[58] The report featured heavily in the media due to the gravity of its message.[59][60][61]

The report described a ""2050 scenario"" which the authors define as a way of thinking at the high-end of the range of possibilities rather than a scientific projection. Within this scenario, policy-makers fail to act sufficiently and global emissions do not peak until 2030. Climate feedbacks are triggered which lead to global warming of 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels by 2030, and 3°C by 2050, leading the Earth into the ""hothouse Earth"" scenario. Sea levels increase by 2-3 metres by 2100, with an eventual 25 metres of sea-level rise locked in. Some regions become unlivable due to the intense heat and lack of adaptive capacity and around a billion people are displaced, while two billion people suffer from water shortages. There is not enough food to feed the global population and many of the world's most populous cities are abandoned due to sea level rise.[58]

In an interview for The Ecologist, the Emeritus Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber warned that if we continue as we are now, then over the next century we may bring civilization to an end. He predicted that humans would survive somehow, but that almost everything which had been built up over the past two thousand years would be destroyed. He rated chances of success in the fight against climate change as more than 5% but definitely less than 50%.[62]

In his 2019 BBC documentary Climate Change – The Facts, Sir David Attenborough warns that dramatic action needed to be taken against climate change within the next decade to avoid irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of human societies.[63] In a 2019 Channel 4 interview with Jon Snow, Attenborough states that the worst outcome of climate change that could be experienced within the next seventy years would be civil unrest and mass migration on a great scale. He predicts that humans will continue to find enough food, but that their diets will be forced to change.[64]

Professor Emeritus of climate strategy at the BI Norwegian Business School Jørgen Randers predicts that we will fail to meet the pledges of the Paris Agreement as in the short-term it is cheaper to continue acting as usual.[65]

As a lifelong environmentalist, Prince Charles has given speeches warning that climate change could bring unimaginable horrors and that it calls into question our future survival on the planet.[66]

Pope Francis has stated that climate change threatens the future of the human family and that we must take action to protect future generations and the world's poorest who will suffer the most from humanity's actions. He has also stated that our choice of energy has the potential to destroy our civilization and that this must be avoided.[67]

In an interview, the Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres warned that the world was losing the fight against climate change, and described lack of action on climate change as ""suicide"".[68]

According to Professor Jem Bendell, Deep Adaptation is the concept purporting that humanity needs to prepare for fundamental disruption of its current civilisation paradigms, due to climate change, with a likelihood of complete societal collapse. Unlike climate change adaptation, which aims to adapt societies gradually to the effects of climate change, Deep Adaptation is premised on accepting abrupt transformation of the environment as a consideration for making decisions today.[69]

In 2019, Jem Bendell started the Deep Adaptation Forum. According to the website, the Deep Adaptation Forum is an ""international online space to connect people, in all spheres of life, to foster mutual support; collaboration; and professional development in the process of facing societal collapse.""[70] Bendell also created a Deep Adaptation Facebook group for discussing these topics.

Various academic publications describe how political discourse, the media, and scientific studies address the idea of a potential climate apocalypse.[71]

People in various cultures at various times have told stories about climate change.[72] Among all cultures and times which tell these stories, patterns in the stories which repeat include questioning whether humans caused the change, the relationship between short-term local experiences and longer term global records, people of common cultures producing images of climate change which align with others in their culture but not with those outside their culture, designating certain classes of institutions like laboratories as being reliable sources of information, and the modification of reliable reports to create a more desirable narrative of how the information ought to lead to a particular community changing their behavior.[72] Discussion of climate change is unusual for having attracted unusually diverse participation of communities which strongly present their own view. Those communities include citizens engaged in public participation, academic sectors, any non-academic professional sector asserting knowledge, participants in popular culture, advocates for Indigenous peoples, anyone negotiating the powers of capitalism, those practicing a religion, and anyone responding to public opinion.[72] Sources of information about climate change tell various categories of stories, including personal experiences, community experiences, scientific models, economic forecasts, and prophecies of apocalypse.[72]

Some researchers have speculated that society cannot comprehend an accurate end of the world prediction, and instead, more governments would be willing to respond productively to prevent catastrophe if reports framed the matter as a smaller problem than it actually is.[73] Talking about potential disaster can have a broad impact upon society by making many people feel that if the situation were truly horrible, then there must be good plans to prevent it so no further action is needed.[74]

As climate apocalypse becomes more real, the media presents many imagined apocalypse scenarios in a way that conflates them all.[75]

Political conversations about climate apocalypse tend to describe how preventing it in the future would bring zero value for today, therefore the value of doing something today is zero.[76] The lack of response to climate change despite it being an existential risk may be an indication that human society lacks an ability to understand a threat of this magnitude without some radical change in perspective.[77]

Esquire described how since 1990 climate scientists have communicated urgent warnings while simultaneously experiencing the media converting their statements into sensational entertainment.[78]

A 2013 report described how incorporating the concept of preventing catastrophe into public policy seems unprecedented and challenging to accomplish.[79]

Climate fiction is a popular media genre which frequently features stories of climate apocalypse. Examples include Ismael, a 1992 philosophical novel,[80] and Mad Max: Fury Road, a 2015 action film.[81][82][83]

Concern over a climate apocalypse has been the subject of articles of satirical news features. One theme is popular revolt against power brokers. Another is the desire of youth to have a liveable environment in adulthood.[84][85] Another are fantasies about the romance and adventure of people experiencing the chaos of ecological and societal collapse.[86][87]

527,"Climate policy is dangling between the cynicism of Donald Trump and the radicalism of Greta Thunberg. The US president has just pulled the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases out of the Paris climate accord. Ms Thunberg demands significantly more than a 50 per cent cut in global net emissions by 2030. The former is certainly irresponsible. But the latter seems inconceivable.

The exasperation of radical climate activists is understandable. Despite decades of talk, emissions of greenhouse gases and global temperatures continue to rise. If the trend does not alter soon, the chances of avoiding an increase in global average temperatures of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will be zero and those of avoiding a 2C increase will be tiny.

As the IMF notes in its latest Fiscal Monitor, meeting the latter goal requires reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by a third below the baseline, by 2030. To keep below a 1.5C increase, emissions need to be half of the baseline.

The longer the delay in acting, the larger the required action becomes, until nothing can be done because it will be too late. It is already almost too late to avoid what experts view as destructive and irreversible changes in climate. For that reason, dramatic policies are needed. Yet they are feasible, argues the Energy Transitions Commission, if they are firmly implemented over the next three decades.

Unfortunately, the outright opposition of people such as Mr Trump, and the indifference of much of the population, are not the sole obstacles to success. Even some who favour action are a problem, because the climate cause is for them part of a wider campaign against the market.

Thus, many supporters of the Green New Deal view climate as a justification for the planned economy. As British journalist Paul Mason argues: “Labour wants to combat climate change through three mechanisms: state spending, state lending and the state direction of private finance.” This approach allows opponents to argue that the left is more concerned with destroying market economies than saving the planet. The mess created by trying to plan an economy into zero net emissions in a decade might bring all attempts at mitigation into disrepute.

In any case, climate change will not be solved by one country. To succeed, policy must be effective, legitimate and global.

To be effective, policy must combine planning, regulation, research and incentives. There is strong justification for government actions in research, spatial planning and finance. But there is also a need for incentives aimed at shifting behaviour. Command and control are rarely as effective all on their own.

The IMF report suggests $75 a tonne of carbon might be the price in 2030 consistent with keeping the temperature increase below 2C. Today, while there are a host of pricing arrangements, the prices themselves are mostly far too low and variable over time and across countries to be useful. Yet, in principle, a carbon tax, or an emissions trading system with a price floor, is the most effective (because most comprehensive) way to influence emissions.

Schemes that generate fiscal revenue ought also to be attractive to politicians, because the money can be used for other valuable purposes. Taxing a “bad” (a form of pollution, in this case) always offers an opportunity to improve taxation or raise valuable spending.

An important point made by the IMF report is that such countries as China and India could benefit especially from a reduction in local environmental pollution, because of the benefits of reduced use of coal. It is also vital that these countries do see such benefits from use of carbon taxes, because they are going to have to play a big part in bringing about the needed reductions in global emissions (relative to the baseline). It is in these countries, too, that a huge part of the needed investment in new energy systems must be made. So incentives matter greatly.

To make policy legitimate, it is essential to compensate losers. It is not true that the poor are always proportionately most adversely affected by higher energy prices. But protests by the rest of the population matter, too. Compensation for higher fuel prices needs to be visible. As important, a convincing vision of a better future must be offered. Otherwise, the necessary changes in policy will never be accepted.

Finally, policy has to be global, with all the bigger economies involved. This creates huge problems of equity. Clearly we are never going to reach a perfect solution. But some solution will have to be found in generous assistance from high-income countries to emerging and developing countries, especially with the introduction of new technologies. This also raises an important question: what is to be done with free-riders and, above all, the biggest free-rider of all, the rogue US? The answer in principle is clear: it will have to be penalised quite heavily. If we accept, as we should, the urgency of the challenge, this follows quite naturally.

What, then, is to be done? The answers include a programme of action over three decades, starting now; pragmatic resort to all policy tools, including market-based incentives; use of the revenue raised from carbon pricing to compensate losers and make the tax system and climate mitigation more efficient; a stress on the local environment benefits of eliminating the use of fossil fuels; and, above all, a commitment to climate as a shared global challenge. In an era of populism and nationalism, is there any chance of all this? Not obviously, alas. If so, we will indeed have failed. But the young are surely right to expect better.

970,"With No Visitors, Australian Scuba Companies Are Planting Coral On Great Barrier Reef

While the Australian tourism industry may have dried up in the coronavirus lockdown, dive tour operators have decided to put their time to good use by planting coral along the Great Barrier Reef.

Family-owned Cairns-based company Passions of Paradise have provided a catamaran and fuel. Other businesses involved include Wavelength, Ocean Freedom, Sailaway and Quicksilver Cruises. They are working alongside a team from the University of Technology Sydney led by Dr. David Suggett.

The initiative is called the Coral Nurture Program. Similar projects in the area were already in place, such as the Crown-of-Thorns (a coral destroying starfish) eradication and the Eye on Reef monitoring program.

But what makes this latest project unique is that it’s the first time tour companies have worked together with researchers.

The technique being used to restore the coral – using ‘coral clips’, is also a first.

Lorna Howlett, project coordinator and PhD student, explains how it works:

“It involves finding fragments of opportunity – coral fragments that have naturally broken off,” she said. “And attaching them back on to the reef using a coral clip. We can only use fragments of opportunity found at the site, so Passions of Paradise has installed six frames at the site which can be used as a nursery to grow more corals.”

Approximately 1000 pieces of coral have been planted on Hastings Reef so far.

The Great Barrier Reef is home to an incredibly diverse array of sea-life and was declared a World Heritage Area in 1981. Situated off the northeast coast of Australia, it stretches for around 2300km. It is the biggest coral reef system in the world, comprising around 2900 individual reefs and 900 islands.

A 2014 report by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority found that climate change and global heating is the biggest threat to the reef.

Polluted land water quality running into the sea, coastal development, fishing, ocean acidification and coral bleaching are other major issues.

According to a 2012 report, the Great Barrier Reef has lost half it’s coral since 1985.

In 2015, the Reef 2050 Plan came into place. This is a 35-year plan for the long-term management of pollution and climate change.

Skies Are Clearer and Global Pollution Is Down Because of COVID-19 — But Can We Sustain It?

That’s good news because it shows that the world can reduce carbon emissions by a lot, which scientists say humanity needs to do if we are to survive in decades to come.

As it is, 2020 will likely end up as one of the hottest years in history, with more devastating storms, droughts and floods to come, according to a groundbreaking study recently released by Nature Climate Change.

“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” the study’s lead author, Professor Corinne Le Quéré of the University of East Anglia said. “These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary though, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport or energy systems.”

“COVID-19 has been disruptive, costly, and tragic, but there are some hopeful elements that we can pull out of this pivotal moment in human history,” says Howard, an ER doctor in Yellowknife, Canada, who is also board president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment and TEDx speaker.

Here are five positives to take away from the pandemic as we continue to fight COVID-19 and the even larger existential threat of climate change:

“Now that many have mastered Zoom, and have equipped their homes for virtual work, we can expect at least some degree of telecommuting to continue as we open up and children go back to school, saving people up to several hours a day in commuting time,” Howard tells PEOPLE.

“We know that longer driving time, particularly over a couple of hours per day, is associated with insufficient physical activity, less sleep and worse physical and mental health, and so this gives us back our most precious resource: time. Time to exercise, time to cook healthy meals at home, time to snuggle with our kids, time to rest.”

“When pressed, we prioritize health and are capable of changing the world quickly,"" says Howard. ""Sometimes in climate-related work, people have gotten discouraged by entrenched habits and power structures. Could we ever have pictured, at Christmas, that the world could change this much, this quickly?""

“Now we know that, although our responses haven't been perfect, we can work together as a global community, and create significant science-based change on a quick time-line,"" Howard adds. ""This helps us see that a rapid, effective response to climate change is possible.”

“The reduction in vehicle traffic has cleared the skies in many cities around the world, allowing us to see how bright and fresh the world can feel when we reduce fossil fuel use,"" says Howard. ""With outdoor air pollution responsible for 4.2 million deaths a year around the globe, according to the World Health Organization, this shows us that not only can the world look wonderful when we use less fossil fuels, but that doing so can save lives immediately, and through decreased health impacts of climate change from wildfires, heat-related illness and more, [we can] continue to improve health for generations to come.""

“When we work together, we can save lives, and by building back better, we can save more,"" she says. ""I went to school for years to learn how to save lives in the Emergency Room. By listening to scientists, people around the globe have demonstrated how much we care about health, and one another, and have saved lives by staying home!""

“With the Lancet-UNICEF-WHO Future Child Report having shown us that climate change is one of the major health risks for today's children, if we extend that same care for one another to a commitment to a healthy recovery, we have a generational opportunity to channel our economic stimulus funds into the acceleration of a transition to a clean energy economy.""",mainstream,M0fe92,climate.change

But the smartest companies are also paying attention to “carbon risk”—the costs they will have to bear as governmental policies extract a growing price for CO emissions. These firms are setting internal carbon prices (ICPs), putting a monetary value on their own emissions to better prepare for success in a lower-carbon world.

This article explains the process firms go through: measuring their direct and indirect emissions, ascertaining current external carbon prices (both explicit and implicit), predicting future ones, deciding what time horizons their ICPs should cover, and considering emissions-reduction goals. The authors then discuss how internal carbon pricing is helping companies make decisions about new investments, manage financial and regulatory risks, and develop long-term strategy.",mainstream,M0b0d9,climate.change
989,"Pharma hack Paul Offit accidentally admits that the FDA’s process for licensing vaccines is fraudulent

In a failed attempt at trying to dissuade educated parents against choosing to not have their children vaccinated based on antibody blood tests, Big Pharma hack Paul Offit has inadvertently admitted, on the record, that the federal government’s official vaccine policies are fundamentally flawed, at best, and very likely scientifically fraudulent.

In a recent video published by the “Vaccine Education Center” at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) where he works, Offit tries to make the case that antibody blood tests, which measure antibody levels as an indicator of immunity against disease, aren’t medically useful. If this is the case, then everything that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rely upon to create vaccine policy is also not medically useful, or accurate.

Using antibody blood tests to try to measure a protective immune response, in Offit’s own words, is “not as easily done as you would think.” And yet, the presence of antibodies in the blood has long been what government officials claim is, in fact, a valid indicator that a person is immune to disease – so which is it?

The answer is neither and both, depending upon what’s trying to be accomplished. In Offit’s case, the goal is to keep as many parents as possible on the vaccine train, which will ensure that vaccine manufacturers like himself continue to rake in massive profits. At the same time, Offit’s very argument is invalidated by his own admissions towards this end, as he clearly states in the video that antibody titer does not necessarily correlate with immunity. Similarly, a lack of antibodies is not necessarily an indicator of a lack of immunity.

Using a measles outbreak that occurred during the late 1980s and early 1990s to try to make his point, Offit states in the video that, when looking back on this particular outbreak, it was discovered that “there were many people who had been vaccinated, but who didn’t have antibodies against measles who were still protected.” In other words, antibody tests aren’t, in fact, a valid indicator of immunity, even though this is what the government uses as “evidence” that vaccines somehow work.

“The reason they were still protected is they had something called memory cells,” Offit further explains.

“Memory immunological cells, like B- and T-cells, which then, when they were exposed to the virus, became activated, differentiated, made antibodies, which then protected them. So even though they didn’t have circulating antibodies in their bloodstream, they still have these memory cells in their immune system that could then respond when they were exposed. So, if you looked at those people and saw they didn’t have antibodies, you would have falsely concluded they weren’t protected when they were.”

For more news about the government’s vaccine fraud, be sure to check out Vaccines.news.

Thank you, Paul Offit, for once again illustrating why parents shouldn’t vaccinate their children

Offit goes on in the video to admit that sometimes you can have antibodies in your bloodstream “and not be protected” – again, his own words. As it turns out, it appears to be some combination of antibody levels, cell-mediated immunity, and mucosal immunity that provides true protection against disease, depending on the disease, meaning vaccine science as it’s currently being propagated by public health officials is wholly inaccurate and unreliable.

It remains unclear whether or not Offit truly realizes what he’s confessed to, here, seeing as how the video in question is still available for viewing on the CHOP website. Or perhaps Offit is too dense to even realize what he’s now publicly admitted, which only goes to show how deluded these vaccine-pushers are when it comes to their methods of persuasion.

Hilariously, Offit’s conclusion in the video isn’t that the entirety of vaccine science needs to be reevaluated due to these inherent flaws. Instead, he says that, because “titers are difficult,” and “not a perfect indicator” of immunity, that “the best way of knowing that you’re protected is to get the vaccines that are recommended at the time they are recommended.”

In other words, nothing the vaccine lobby has been saying for decades makes an ounce of sense, and the whole thing is obviously a fraud. But keep on getting your vaccines, people, because that’s the only way to keep yourself safe and healthy! One wonders: Who is actually buying this tripe anymore and subjecting their family to its illogical provisions?

“Far from providing parents with a convincing argument for why they should strictly comply with the CDC’s childhood vaccine schedule, what Paul Offit and the CHOP have provided us with in this video is a strong argument for why the very process by which vaccines obtain licensure by the FDA is scientifically invalid,” writes Jeremy R.

503,"Here’s the bad: The ship, Kapitan Dranitsyn, burned so much fuel that now it, too, has to be resupplied. Another icebreaker is on its way to bring it more fuel.

Such are the logistical complexities of the expedition, known as Mosaic, in which a German research ship, Polarstern, has been drifting with the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean since October with a revolving complement of scientists. The ship is expected to come out of the ice east of Greenland in September after gathering a year’s worth of data on conditions in the remote Central Arctic.

The Kapitan Dranitsyn left Tromso, Norway, on Jan. 29 with 43 tons of food, fuel and other supplies for the Polarstern, as well as a replacement team of researchers and technicians for what is the third two-month leg of the expedition. The resupply trip was expected to take about two weeks, but the icebreaker ran into trouble from the start, when a storm in the Barents Sea forced it to anchor off Tromso for the better part of a week.

Once underway, the ship encountered sea ice that had gotten much thicker as the winter progressed — doubling to more than 5 feet, or 1.5 meters, in places. The Kapitan Dranitsyn finally arrived at the Polarstern on Feb. 28.

After several days unloading the supplies and transferring personnel across about a half-mile of ice in dangerous conditions (a wind chill of minus 72 degrees Fahrenheit, or about minus 58 Celsius), the Kapitan Dranitsyn left for the return trip to Tromso. But calculations showed that it would not have enough diesel fuel for the journey.

So on March 3, another icebreaker, the Admiral Makarov, left Murmansk, Russia, with a load of extra fuel to intercept the Kapitan Dranitsyn on its way. Early this week, the two ships were about 350 miles, or roughly 560 kilometers, apart.

Markus Rex, an atmospheric scientist who is Mosaic’s leader, wrote in a blog post that the delay in resupplying the Polarstern was “absolutely in keeping with what had to be expected” given the ice conditions.",mainstream,M0862f,climate.change
529,"veryone faces choices every day that carry a climate cost. Do we turn the lights on in the morning, or is the light of daybreak sufficient for finding matching socks? Do we feast on bacon and eggs for breakfast, or will a bowl of oatmeal suffice? There is a lot of talk these days about the need to lead lower-carbon lifestyles. There is also a lot of finger-pointing going on and, some argue, virtue signaling. But who is truly walking the climate walk? The carnivore who doesn’t fly? The vegan who travels to see family abroad? If nobody is without carbon sin, who gets to cast the first lump of coal? If all climate advocates were expected to live off the grid, eating only what they could grow themselves and wearing only the clothes they’d knitted from scratch, there wouldn’t be much of a climate movement. That level of sacrifice is unacceptable to most.

We don’t need to ban cars; we need to electrify them (and we need that electricity to come from clean energy). We don’t need to ban burgers; we need climate-friendly beef. To spur these changes, we need to put a price on carbon, to incentivize polluters to invest in these solutions. Though air travel accounts for only a paltry 2% of global emissions, whether or not climate scientists should fly consumes far more than 2% of my Twitter timeline. Unfortunately, sometimes doing science means traveling great distances, and we don’t always have the time or luxury to take slower low-carbon options. We have a job to do, after all. But even still, a single scientist, or even hundreds of scientists, choosing to never fly again is not going to change the system. Purchasing carbon offsets for flights is a viable means of decarbonizing your air travel, for now. However, the true solution, pricing carbon, requires policy change.

There is a long history of industry-funded “deflection campaigns” aimed to divert attention from big polluters and place the burden on individuals. Individual action is important and something we should all champion. But appearing to force Americans to give up meat, or travel, or other things central to the lifestyle they’ve chosen to live is politically dangerous: it plays right into the hands of climate-change deniers whose strategy tends to be to portray climate champions as freedom-hating totalitarians.

The bigger issue is that focusing on individual choices around air travel and beef consumption heightens the risk of losing sight of the gorilla in the room: civilization’s reliance on fossil fuels for energy and transport overall, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of global carbon emissions. We need systemic changes that will reduce everyone’s carbon footprint, whether or not they care. The good news is we have tactics to bring environmentally friendly (and non-lifestyle-disrupting) options to fruition­: pricing carbon emissions and creating incentives for renewable energy and reduced consumption. By putting a price on carbon, people can actually make money by reducing emissions, selling their services to corporations that are always looking for ways to cut costs. Never underestimate the resourcefulness of Americans when there’s a dime to be made! But a price on carbon needs to be designed such that marginalized communities most at risk from climate impacts aren’t adversely impacted economically as well.

This is why we really need political change at every level, from local leaders to federal legislators all the way up to the President. We need change not just at the breakfast table, but at the ballot box as well.

415,"Ban Ki-moon gives up fight against climate change

In November 2009, the ClimateGate erupted and many of us were convinced that the establishment of climate fear would quickly collapse. I was imagining that it would be as fast as the Velvet Revolution that began exactly 20 years earlier.

So many climate skeptics were disillusioned by the speed. Now, 14 months later, things are beginning to move at the top places. Barack Obama hasn’t mentioned any climate, warming, disruption, carbon, or fossil fuels in his key annual talk – even though he was talking for a whole hour. The Guardian just brought us another dose of good news:

The boss of the United Nations will stop his personal involvement in the battle to regulate the world climate. Instead, he will try to achieve “immediate gains” in the field of clean energy and sustainable development. Even his U.N. colleagues have apparently understood that there can’t be any “deal”.

Now, obviously, I have nothing whatsoever against clean or renewable energy sources. My only complaint is against huge subsidies of such things that used to be justified ideologically – by the deluded propaganda about climate disruption.

Stock up with Fresh Food that lasts with eFoodsDirect (AD)

If this propaganda really goes away, as Obama and Ki-moon indicate by their shifted attitudes, there is a hope that common sense and rational costs-and-benefits analysis will return to the energy industry and beyond.

In the 2011 State of the Union address, Obama also mentioned oil and biofuels that could replace it. That’s surprising because even Al Gore has admitted that their support of biofuels was a big blunder. On the other hand, I can imagine that there will exist biofuels that actually make economic sense.

What I find important is that politicians will no longer promote nonsensical solutions by general slogans that are based on bad science, fearmongering, and intimidation referring to insane planetary emergencies. We, the climate skeptics, have been warning against such irrational attitudes and we have been proved right pretty much in all cases. First-generation biofuels as well as carbon trading has been showed to be a disaster while solar and wind power turned out to be significant economic problems in many countries such as my homeland.

Well, of course, I don’t believe that the politicians will completely stop doing irrational things. But the amount of this bad policymaking could simply decrease as the rats are gradually leaving the rotten and sinking bandwagon. Let us hope that many other politicians will follow in Obama’s and Ki-moon’s footsteps. As many more people regain their common sense and all plans to regulate carbon evaporate, almost everyone will see that the Earth is doing just fine and the climate skeptics have saved trillions of dollars.

Will they be rewarded or will they remain the silent heroes who have just saved the civilization without any greed? ;-)

398,"""Given the right circumstances, being different is a superpower,"" Greta Thunberg wrote on Twitter

How Greta Thunberg — Now the Youngest TIME Person of the Year Ever — 'Destroys' Asperger's Stigma

The Swedish 16 year old — who was named TIME’s Person of the Year on Wednesday, making her the youngest person to ever be given the honor — hasn’t shied away from flipping the script on her Asperger’s, at one point referring to it not as an obstacle but as her “superpower.”

The pride with which she embraces her diagnosis has not been lost on others with Asperger’s, who now view Thunberg as a role model. Case in point: the trending Twitter hashtag “Autistics for Greta.”

“She is my SHERO!” user @hmcooperauthor wrote in September. “Such a fearless, articulate young woman. We might be considered ‘odd, weird, quirky….’ Or whatever adjectives that you prefer to insert but I’m convinced folks on the Autism Spectrum have superpowers that you all just don’t…”

User @ThruThePrismArt agreed, writing, “I’m on the spectrum. Anyone who underestimates Greta has NO IDEA how powerful the autistic brain is when set to a specific goal. The strength of being #ActuallyAutistic is LIMITLESS.”

“This is it!! This is what ASD is. Passion and unending dedication to a cause,” user @AmberOckerbloom added. “@GretaThunberg is a superhero to my daughter and all those on the spectrum. ASD is why she is who she is. How can that ever be something bad?!”

Regardless of why they’re paying attention to her, Thunberg told PEOPLE she knows she has many eyes watching her every move — and hopes to make the best of it.

“Right now, I have a lot of people listening to what I am saying, so I am using that platform to try to achieve a change,” she said.

The disorder is characterized by having difficulty with social interactions, restricted interests, a desire for sameness, and distinctive strengths, like “remarkable” focus and persistence, an aptitude for recognizing patterns, and attention to detail, according to Autism Speaks.

Those strengths have served Thunberg well, as she explained on CBS This Morning that her Asperger’s actually helps her in seeing the world through a different lens.

“In some circumstances it can definitely be an advantage to have some kind of neurotypical diagnosis, to be neurodiverse, because that makes you different, that makes you think differently,” she said. “And especially in such a big crisis like this, when we need to think outside the box. We need to think outside our current system, we need people who think outside the box and who aren’t like everyone else.”

“I’m not public about my diagnosis to ‘hide’ behind it, but because I know many ignorant people still see it as an ‘illness,’ or something negative,” she wrote.

“I think she’s a role model to everyone,” Remi told NBC News. “But I think for somebody who has Asperger’s or is on the autism spectrum, her ability to be honest and disclose it in such an empowering way is what’s inspirational. Greta is disclosing it in a way that she’s proud of.”

“It means a lot that she’s willingly embraced Asperger’s syndrome and talks about it openly. It creates a lot of awareness and destroys some stigmas,” he said. “I think it would have had a tremendous impact on what I viewed as possible not only for myself, but for cultivating relationships around me.”

“I think it’s very hopeful, all the young people who are a part of the climate change movement,” she previously told PEOPLE. “That keeps me going, to see that it actually has made a difference. Because there is no second option.”",mainstream,M0749c,climate.change
1263,"There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic is the crisis of the moment, and a terribly serious one at that, threatening not only human lives but also the global economy.

But it’s not the only crisis the world is facing, and we ought not, while confronting the immediate menace, disregard the other immense threat looming over us: global warming. Rather, somewhat counterintuitively, we should use the current pandemic to learn some lessons and glean some insights about the other perils we will soon be facing.

We’re not suggesting that climate change contributed to the coronavirus outbreak; there seems to be no direct link, although experts say a warming world could accelerate pandemics of insect-borne diseases (the coronavirus is spread person to person). But the global response to this pandemic does show that the world can come together to confront a shared threat. That could bode well for addressing climate change — if we treat it as seriously.

The pandemic is putting a chokehold on economic activity in hard-hit regions of the world — China, Europe and here in the U.S. When factories and businesses are closed, workers and customers stay home (here in California and in New York, by order of the governors). With few people traveling long distances, airlines slash flights. Sure, people and businesses continue to use energy, but not at the levels they did just a month ago. And that reduction in energy use in turn reduces fossil fuel consumption and emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Little of this will be long-lasting. Once the epidemic subsides, economic activity will resume and so, presumably, will emissions.

But the crisis offers opportunities for change, and we ought to be mindful of them as the pandemic and the economic crisis play out. Businesses are learning how much of their workforce can do their jobs remotely, which offers guidance for how they might operate in the future with a lighter carbon footprint. Consumers are undergoing a forced experiment in changed patterns of shopping and consumption.

Congress and President Trump also are negotiating a series of bailouts and other support packages to help people and businesses survive. They should take this opportunity to press for changes in how some of these industries operate.

The airline industry, for instance, should be asked to do more to reduce its carbon emissions, which have soared in recent years and will continue to rise as air travel itself is projected to increase. A September paper from the International Council on Clean Transportation used industry data to conclude that commercial air operations account for 2.4% of global carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels, and that industry emissions in 2018 were 32% higher than five years before.

One available emissions-reducing alternative is the use of so-called sustainable aviation fuels, including biofuels, but they are more expensive than conventional jet fuel. And airline companies can be pressured to adopt aggressive plans to replace older, higher-polluting planes. That would be in line with the demand for increased fuel efficiency commitments that the Obama administration attached to its bailout package for the auto industry.

Of course, extracting climate-friendly concessions will vary by the industry seeking bailout help, so we won’t get too prescriptive here. The main imperative for the government is to keep climate policy in mind as it devises a plan to rescue the economy.

But wait, you think. This is the Trump administration, which at best shrugs at the science and ignores global warming. True enough, but Congress also is involved, and it can place climate considerations on the table.

Here’s a good place to start: The government should not be bailing out the oil and gas industry at a time when we should be focusing on expanding production of renewable energy and the infrastructure to store and deliver it.

In recent days, early coronavirus scoffers — including the president — have come around to the reality that this pandemic is a deadly threat and have finally begun taking strong steps to address it. Yet global warming is a larger and longer-lasting threat to humankind. We have about a decade, according to the experts, to make significant reductions in carbon emissions to avoid the worst ramifications of climate change. The world already is seeing the effects in longer and more severe droughts in some places, record flooding in others, stronger and more intense tropical storms and regional temperature rises that are making parts of the word nearly uninhabitable.

The science confirms all this, as it has confirmed the spread and dangers from the novel coronavirus. So maybe accepting the reality of COVID-19 will lead the administration to recognize the reality of climate change and work with Congress to begin addressing it in meaningful ways.",mainstream,M1289c,climate.change
788,"Humans need to adapt to the impacts of climate change, for instance through technological solutions such as coastal defences and changes in consumption habits. Humans are already adapting to climate change, and further adaptation efforts will be necessary during coming decades. However, adaptation alone is not expected to be able to cope will all projected effects since the options diminish and the costs increase with rising temperatures.

Vulnerability of human populations to climate change and its consequences can be affected by other factors, such as pollution, conflicts, or epidemics such as AIDS. An emphasis on sustainable development can help human societies reduce their vulnerability to climate change. However, climate change itself can become an impediment to their development.

Mitigation measures that aim to reduce greenhouse gases emissions can help avoid, reduce or delay impacts, and should be implemented in order to ensure that adaptation capacity is not exceeded.",mainstream,M0c3d7,climate.change
994,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Russia’s first plan to adapt to climate change is a tardy but much-needed acknowledgement of the risks and opportunities presented by global warming, although it lacks concrete action to address the increasingly evident threats, analysts said.

The document, published this month on a government website, said climate change would have a significant and growing influence on Russia’s “socio-economic development, living conditions and human health, as well as on the state of economic infrastructure”.

Russia would need to adjust to an increase in droughts, heavy rainfall, flooding, forest fires and infectious diseases, and should start teaching climate change in schools, it said.

Given the “increasing vulnerability” of the population and economy to extreme weather and climate impacts, measures to adapt would be of “strategic importance”, including “making use of” new economic opportunities, it added.

The fossil fuel-rich nation could reap advantages from higher temperatures and melting ice, including less use of energy for heating, increased access for shipping in the Arctic and an expansion of agricultural production, it noted.

But climate change experts said the new framework was too general and did not require authorities to take real steps in the near term – even as the effects of climate change are becoming more apparent.

Alexey Kokorin, head of the climate and energy program at green group WWF-Russia, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation adaptation to a warming climate was “so evidently a necessity”.

The negative consequences of climate change were “already quite strong” for Russia but it had yet to work out how “to take advantage of the positive ones”, he added.

Temperatures in Russia have risen 2.5 times faster than the global average since the mid-1970s, according to the document.

Recent climate-related disasters in Russia have included 2019 wildfires that raged across Siberia, destroying at least 3 million hectares (7.4 million acres) of forest.

Roman Vilfand, acting head of Russia’s Hydrometeorology Center, noted this month that temperatures across the country were far above normal levels, including 20C higher than average in Siberia, one of the world’s coldest places.

Moscow’s authorities were even forced to bring in artificial snow for New Year celebrations during the Russian capital’s warmest December since 1886.

And in early January, ice melted on the Yenisei River in Siberia’s Krasnoyarsk region, flooding several villages.

Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the plan, which it produced, would lay the foundations for a national strategy to adapt to climate change, while raising public awareness of the issue.

“It will also emphasize that the Russian Federation is ready to make efforts and systematically deal with the fight against climate change,” the ministry said in a written comment.

The document outlines a framework for national adaptation, mainly through legislative amendments and drafting of plans for regions and economic sectors over the next three years.

The ministry plans to start developing and costing detailed measures only in late 2022.

“Regions are not really required to do anything over the next few years - it is a very unambitious document,” said Georgy Safonov, associate professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.

Until recently Russia had no coordinated policy on climate change adaptation and most of its responses to weather disasters were “reactive”, he said by email.

In a social media post, Russian youth climate activists in the Fridays for Future group welcomed the new plan but said “as always, the Russian government is in no hurry and is turning a blind eye to the sky-rocketing average temperature on the planet”.

While acknowledging that the world is heating up and climate change poses a serious threat to Russia, President Vladimir Putin expressed doubt over whether climate change is man-made at his end-of-year press conference.

Russia’s greenhouse gas emissions have declined significantly since 1990, mainly due to plummeting industrial production after the collapse of the Soviet economy.

In recent years there has been a minor increase in emissions, but they are still about 30% lower than 1990 levels.

The country’s emissions reduction target for 2030, set in 2015, is to limit greenhouse gases to 70-75% of 1990 levels, which analysts consider unambitious and insufficient to help meet global targets to curb warming.

WWF-Russia’s Kokorin emphasized the need for a sharper focus on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. “Adaptation has clear limits and we are not far from these limits,” he said.

The new adaptation framework will form part of wider climate legislation, including a long-term low-carbon strategy, set to be adopted later this year, after Russia formally joined the Paris climate accord last September.

Meanwhile, the government has publicly stated that it hopes to capitalize on greater access to Arctic shipping routes and natural resources - including oil, gas and minerals - as Russia’s frozen north heats up.

The amount of land available for growing crops is also set to increase, the adaptation plan said, while livestock breeding could become more efficient and boreal forests grow faster.

But WWF-Russia’s Kokorin warned of “pitfalls” and a risk of negative feedback cycles. They include faster warming caused by melting permafrost which releases large amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

Any boost to forest growth could be outweighed by forest fires and unsustainable logging, Kokorin added.

And damage to agriculture from hotter temperatures was likely to be larger than the benefits, with soils poor in the warming north and droughts hitting the south, he said.

“Yes, (climate change) is positive for the Russian north, but it will be very small compared to the south, where the negative effects will be more significant,” he said.",mainstream,M0b109,climate.change
636,"The whole situation is intractable. Adversaries have locked horns and it is impossible to have a civilized debate. You are either for or against, right or wrong, good or evil. There is no room for anything in between. There is simply no time to talk, the end is nigh. Now is the time for action, not words. Alarm bells are ringing everywhere.

There is no doubt, the climate is important: This is about melting glaciers, withering landscapes, rising sea levels and starving polar bears.

What always gets left out, however, are the steps already being taken to make sure less CO2 is released into the atmosphere. The things that make factories cleaner, lower automobile emissions or even cut them altogether by going electric. In most cases, such measures are brushed off by critics as ""greenwashing.""

Here are a couple of randomly chosen examples of steps already being taken: 10 years ago, the German steel manufacturer Salzgitter started something it called its EnergyEfficiency project. Since then, it has saved a million tons of CO2, as well as consuming 3,300 Terajoule less energy each year — enough to power some 55,000 households.

Another example is Washington State Ferries, the world's second-largest ferry operator. The company is currently in the process of converting its fleet — which had consumed some 75 million liters (20 million gallons) of diesel fuel annually — to battery power.

But why? Because Governor Jay Inslee signed a law mandating it. But the head of the company has also said the change isn't just about conforming to the new law. He says it's a good idea, adding that you don't have to be an environmental activist to appreciate the fact that it means quieter boats, less pollution and more financial savings.

More and more companies are going green

Just recently, during the latest COP25 global climate conference in Madrid, some 180 companies also committed themselves to ambitious environmental goals, pledging to cut emissions continuously with the aim of being carbon neutral by 2050 at the latest.

And these aren't small, niche companies, but rather big global corporations like the consumer goods producer Beiersdorf; the world's largest beer producer, Ambev; and the International Airline Group, Europe's third-largest airline holding company (British Airways and Iberia). Such commitments have practically doubled the number of companies now in the ""Business Ambition for 1.5˚C: Our Only Future"" alliance since it was founded in September of last year.

Admittedly, other things are also happening, things that bewilder activists and realists alike. One need only look to the disaster that is the German energy transition. True, the percentage of energy produced by renewables has gone up, but — according to the Federal Audit Office –—some €160 billion ($179 billion) has also devoured in the process.

Despite such efforts, the German solar industry is practically nonexistent and things don't look much better for the wind industry. In Germany, people prefer to argue about minimum distances between wind turbines and the next closest village, while our French neighbors negotiate the construction of six new nuclear power plants.

What climate activists really want

Either way: Is it — as climate activists ceaselessly tell us — true that nothing is really happening? Or have the topics of sustainability and environmental compatibility finally struck a note with companies? And if the latter, is it because they provide a good sales strategy? And what would be wrong with that if it did?

Might it not also make sense to look closer at just what climate activists want? Take Luisa Neubauer, for instance, known here as the German Greta Thunberg, despite being a few years older than the Swedish teen; or Carola Rackete, who is internationally known as the refugee-saving captain of the ship Sea Watch 3, but would prefer to be part of the Extinction Rebellion movement.

Both women have now written books: Rackete called hers ""Act: A Call to the Last Generation,"" and Neubauer titled hers ""The End of the Climate Crisis."" Both books go straight to the heart of the matter — they are full of ideas for bans and penalties. The authors call for those who destroy nature to be tried for crimes against humanity. Yet, neither wastes words defending individual rights, arguing that individuals cannot be trusted to decide whether they are for or against climate protection.

In interviews given after her book was published, Carola Rackete went further still: ""Everything we do, or don't do, props up the current system."" That's why civil disobedience is so ""extremely urgent.""

It quickly becomes clear that what these women are after is something much bigger than climate protection: They are at war with the existing economic system, with free-market economies, and with capitalism. And anyone who is opposed to that fight, or is of a different opinion, simply cannot be right. Only those who are for radical climate protection are among the good, and only they own the truth.

But anyone who so vehemently clamors for an environmental planned economy should take a quick look into the recent past. It would seem that the disastrous state of the environment in former East Germany would be enough to illustrate just how ineffective planned systems are when it comes to sustainability and climate protection.

So what now?

In such a heated environment — sorry for the pun — it seems there is no chance of having a rational debate. But we have to talk about how we are going to tackle this challenge, and it is becoming increasingly clear that the discussion has to take place between different generations — one that has experienced life, and another that is impatient.

But apocalyptic scenarios prophesying the end of the world won't lead anywhere. At the most, they will simply harden opposition among those of a different opinion. That would be a shame, because we need the ideas that young people have to offer. We need their youthful nonchalance, their openness and their curiosity. The young need to show us that they can do things better than us — but they should also let us come along on the journey, at least for a while.",mainstream,M0b64d,climate.change
277,"Since the Paris Agreement of 2015, in which signatories agreed to holding the increase in global-average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, there have been many analyses that examined the implications of 1.5 °C and 2 °C of global warming, some of which are summarized in the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C (IPCC SR1.5)5. Many different methods6 and experiments have been used to better understand the differences between 1.5 °C and 2 °C of global warming above pre-industrial levels including timeslice extraction from coupled climate model ensembles7,8, use of single coupled model ensembles3,9, multi-model atmosphere-only ensembles2 and pattern scaling10,11.

It is not explicitly stated in the Paris Agreement text whether the warming levels refer to equilibrium or transient levels of global warming; however, it is generally inferred that these targets refer to stabilized climate12. Most of the analyses that were designed to understand the consequences of these global warming targets, especially those focused on atmospheric variables, used transient-model experiments (analyses of sea-level rise13 and other oceanic variables often use longer coupled-model experiments). For example, timeslice extractions under high GHG emissions scenarios from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project experiment (CMIP5)1 sample a world rapidly warming through the Paris Agreement limits. Specially designed experiments, such as the Community Earth System Model ensemble3, are run to emulate 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer worlds with evolving radiative forcings for two centuries to generate climates that are, in a globally averaged sense for surface air temperature, in a quasi-equilibrium state. The atmosphere-only simulations that form the 1.5 °C and 2 °C climates in the half a degree additional warming, prognosis and projected impacts2 (HAPPI) experiment are forced by warming recently observed sea surface temperatures using transient CMIP5 simulations. These different experiments and methods each have differing degrees of transience and none of which are in full equilibrium. Although these experiments all have value, a robust comparison between transient and equilibrium climates has not been possible owing to fundamental differences in model design.

Previous research comparing transient and equilibrium climates typically used single global climate models14,15 or a small ensemble of models, such that agreement and consistency between models could be investigated16. As a result, some differences between transient and equilibrium climates may be inherent to the model, or models, that were used in these previous analyses. Furthermore, many transient simulations of a single model are needed to adequately sample across phases of internal variability to make a robust comparison.

Here we demonstrate that transient and quasi-equilibrium climates can be compared using extended medium-emissions simulations and short-term high-emissions simulations from the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble1. Our ‘timeshift technique’17 enabled us to analyse multiple models concurrently, such that large samples of model years were generated for both the transient and quasi-equilibrium climate states. We demonstrate that, for projections of mean and extreme temperatures, the use of transient or quasi-equilibrium climate states has a substantial effect on the outcomes.

We used the extended mid-range GHG emissions simulations to 2300 (ECP4.5) from the CMIP5 ensemble1 (Supplementary Table 1) to generate a quasi-equilibrium ensemble (noting that the climate of the twenty-third century is not in full equilibrium) that can be directly compared to transient warming through the equivalent model’s level of global warming under a high-emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). The model-simulated global mean warming was subtracted from the distribution of global-average temperatures of each model to generate ensembles for the comparison of transient and quasi-equilibrium climate states (Fig. 1); regional average and extreme temperatures were subsequently investigated. The robustness of this method—particularly the efficacy of comparing transient and quasi-equilibrium climates derived from a selection of models across global warming levels—and associated sensitivity tests are discussed in the Methods and the Supplementary Information. Specifically, we demonstrate that the difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium warming patterns shows little dependence on the level of global warming itself (Supplementary Information), which differs by almost 2 °C across the models analysed here (Supplementary Table 1). We use this result to enable a comparison of the difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates with the 0.5 °C increment of warming between the Paris Agreement warming levels.

From the ensembles of transient and equivalent quasi-equilibrium climates, we can infer differences between these climate states. For most land areas of the world, the average boreal summer (June–August (JJA)) and winter (December–February (DJF)) temperatures are substantially higher in the transient climate relative to the equivalent quasi-equilibrium climate with strong model agreement. This is especially true in boreal summer over continental climate zones in the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 2a,b). By contrast, over the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic, there are large areas where a quasi-equilibrium climate is on average at least 0.5 °C warmer than the equivalent transient climate. In the quasi-equilibrium world, the passage of time has resulted in heat redistribution such that the land regions are cooler and the extratropical oceans are warmer14,18. This result aligns with previous research showing that ocean warming lags behind warming over the land surface19. The quantification of these differences is important, especially given the recent focus on inferring differences in future warmer climates. As land regions are warmer in the transient climate state, most people in the world would experience higher average local temperatures than in a quasi-equilibrium world. In boreal summer, 91% of the world’s population20 (90% confidence interval (CI): 76–97%) would experience warmer average temperatures in the transient climate state. Many people in North America and Eurasia would experience at least a 0.5 °C warmer local climate in a transient climate than in the quasi-equilibrium equivalent state. In boreal winter, 85% of the global population (90% CI: 70–92%) are in locations where the transient climate is warmer than the quasi-equilibrium climate. In total, more than 600 million people in boreal summer and more than 200 million in boreal winter live in locations where a rapidly warming climate is at least 0.5 °C warmer than the equivalent equilibrium climate. By contrast, fewer than 20 million people live in locations where an equilibrium climate is on average more than 0.5 °C warmer than the transient equivalent for either boreal summer or winter.

The difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium climate states is substantial relative to the difference between the projected 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer worlds8,11 (Fig. 3). Over the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic, where the regional projected warming from 1.5 °C to 2 °C of global warming is lower than elsewhere, the difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates exceeds the difference in regional temperatures between the Paris Agreement levels. Both of these regions play major roles in the uptake and transport of carbon and heat21, as they warm at much slower rates compared with other parts of the world.

Overall, around 15% of Earth’s surface area has a bigger difference between the transient and quasi-equilibrium climates than between the Paris Agreement warming levels. This includes both slow-warming ocean areas, where the quasi-equilibrium 1.5 °C world is warmer than a transient 2 °C world, and continental land regions, where the transient 1.5 °C world is warmer than a quasi-equilibrium 2 °C world. For a typical location on Earth’s surface, the absolute difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates is around 40% of the absolute difference between the Paris warming limits.

The difference between transient and equilibrium climates extends to temperature extremes. The probability ratio of moderate heat extremes22, such as one-in-ten hot seasons (Fig. 4a,b), shows broad regions where a heat event is twice as likely in the transient climate (that is, a one-in-five year event instead) compared with a quasi-equilibrium climate state. This is particularly true in boreal summer where, for almost all land regions of the world, the likelihood of a hot season is significantly higher in a transient climate compared with the equivalent quasi-equilibrium state. Regions with at least a doubling in the probability of hot summers in a transient climate compared with a quasi-equilibrium world of equivalent global warming encompass major cities including New York City, Istanbul, Baghdad, Seoul and Tokyo. Although this is a global-scale analysis, one could infer that for these densely populated locations, the heat-related impacts of human-induced climate change would be lessened in a stabilized climate compared with a rapidly warming climate at the same level of global warming.

A similar pattern of results was found when examining cold extremes, with far fewer cold seasons (below the 10th percentile extracted from the quasi-equilibrium climate) in the transient climate state in Northern Hemisphere land areas (Supplementary Fig. 5). Overlaying estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita20 show that poorer areas of the world tend to experience greater probability of hot seasons in a transient climate than a quasi-equilibrium equivalent (in DJF the correlation is −0.39, although in JJA it is negligible). There is a large benefit of climate stabilization in terms of reduced frequency of hot extremes relative to a rapidly warming climate at the same global warming level, and this is particularly true for the developing world, in which the likelihood of hot seasons is reduced year-round.

Many analyses written for the IPCC SR1.5 have focused on understanding changes in hot and cold extremes between the Paris Agreement global warming limits8,23,24. The results presented in this study demonstrate that the difference in the frequency of hot and cold extremes between a transient and quasi-equilibrium climate state at a given level of global warming is also large for many populated regions of the world. The frequency of hot summers in a world where global-average temperature rapidly passes through a global warming level relative to equilibrating at that level is substantially greater in the Middle East, much of Eurasia and northern Africa, and North America. Results from some studies of future extremes, such as ref. 23, may apply to transient 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer worlds, but would probably represent substantial overestimates for changes in the frequency of heat extremes for equilibrium 1.5 °C and 2 °C climates relative to the present.

The comparison of RCP 8.5 and ECP4.5 simulations from a multi-model ensemble enabled us to isolate the effects of the transient and quasi-equilibrium nature of the different model experiments. This enabled us to address a fundamental question about the nature of the Earth’s climate system: what differences in climate would we expect between transient and equilibrium warmer worlds for a given level of global warming? This is a vitally important question in the context of international agreements such as the Paris Agreement, for which analyses using transient and equilibrium climate model experiments may yield different results and lead to the formation of different conclusions and policy pathways. It is worth noting that some of the largest differences between transient and quasi-equilibrium climate states are identified for regions that are poorly observed and where model biases exist, such as the Southern Ocean25. As a result, projections for the Southern Ocean should be treated with caution, although they generally align with our understanding of the climate system19. Further discussion of the results for the Southern Ocean is provided in the Supplementary Information.

The differences between transient and equilibrium climate states have important implications in impact modelling. For example, some empirical impact models, such as damage functions26, are based on global-average warming, but in reality one would expect different economic costs to occur between transient and equilibrium warmer worlds for both the globe as a whole26 and individual countries27, especially developing countries in the tropics, due to the different patterns of regional warming. Differences in methods used to simulate future climates and their impacts have the potential to lead to decision-makers receiving inadequate information about the nature of possible future climates for their region of interest. This may result in the development of ineffective policy, especially in building resilience for future extreme heat events, which is already more challenging in the developing world28.

Many of our results suggest that the differences between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates are substantial. A future 1.5 °C or 2 °C quasi-equilibrium warmer climate reached after an overshoot (that is, in cases in which global warming has exceeded these limits but then fallen) would probably look very different to the equivalent transient 1.5 °C or 2 °C climate that the world is likely to experience in the coming decades29,30. Indeed, a transient warmer world represents a poor predictor for an equivalent equilibrium world in many populated land regions where the difference in average seasonal temperatures is at least 0.5 °C and the likelihood of hot extremes is at least twice as high in some places under the transient state. Studies of the implications of future global warming must therefore be very clear in their framing of results with respect to the transience of the experiments used for their conclusions to be relevant for policy development.

Current multi-model projection efforts, such as CMIP5 (ref. 1) and the subsequent CMIP6 (ref. 4) projects, do not incorporate experiments that explicitly address the needs of policy-makers following the Paris Agreement. Multi-model experiments that can be used to examine climate change at stabilized 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer climates would be invaluable in meeting the needs of decision-makers given that the Paris Agreement is implicitly targeting stabilized global warming levels12 and that we have demonstrated here that the rate of global warming has a large effect on the warming pattern across the globe. Although single-model experiments have been performed previously3, these are not a substitute for multi-model projections that can more comprehensively examine the impacts of the Paris Agreement global warming levels.

Our study highlights the notable differences in model-simulated transient and quasi-equilibrium climate states. We find that these differences are significant and substantial across many regions of the world, such that they must be considered in the design of both model studies on the implications of future global warming, and in the design of future multi-model experiments following CMIP5 and CMIP6. Studies must be clear in the precise definition of temperature targets and the framework given the differing implications of a given level of global warming depending on the transience of the climate state.",mainstream,M0910d,climate.change
1236,"Back in 1989, Californians received a sobering warning: The accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere would likely bring more droughts, floods, fires, and heat waves to the state.

In the thirty years since, those projections of what would happen in a warming world have proven to be remarkably prescient.

“We’ve already observed some of the things we expected in 1989,” said Susan Fischer Wilhelm, a research manager at the California Energy Commission, the agency that compiled the report.

The assessment laid the groundwork for what has arguably become the country’s most ambitious effort to address global warming.

But to many who worked on the report, looking back on it now only underscores how long we’ve waited to act — and how much time has been wasted.

“I felt a sense of pride of being able to participate in something like this, but also a sense of regret for us as a society,” said Les Baxter, who worked on the report as a policy analyst at the CEC and is now vice president of program strategy for the Pew Charitable Trusts.

“We’ve known what we need to do and we just keep refusing to do it.”

The report might have remained lost to history if Gary Estes hadn’t been going through boxes in his garage last year and stumbled upon a copy.

For decades, Estes has organized the annual California Extreme Precipitation Symposium. And he decided to use this year’s meeting as an opportunity to look back at the 185-page report.

“I thought it would be an appropriate thing to do 30 years later,” said Estes, a citizen activist and self-described “energy nut.”

The symposium, held this week at UC Davis, brought together university and government scientists to discuss report’s findings.

Its state-specific projections were drawn from scientific studies and assessments by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that were released in the late 1980s, as well as from detailed analyses conducted by state agencies.

“I was impressed with the level of rigor that they were able to bring,” said Wilhelm, who gave a presentation at the symposium outlining what we knew then and what we know now.

The report explained that doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would raise temperatures in California by roughly 3 degrees Celsius — which will happen by mid-century if emissions continue to rise, according to the most recent California Climate Change Assessment.

Then, as now, climate models showed no clear change in the state’s average annual precipitation. But the authors noted that 3 degrees of warming would reduce the area of mountain snow cover by half. And it would increase the frequency and severity of winter floods, as more water fell as rain instead of snow. (Both changes have already started to occur, Wilhelm said.)

In contrast, spring runoff would drop by a third. (They’ve already fallen over the last century, Wilhelm said.)

The authors added that, although there was still debate among scientists at the time, climate change could also bring more variable weather.

The report outlined the ways in which changes in the seasonal pattern of precipitation would pose problems for the state’s reservoirs, which would have to release water during the rainy season to avoid overflowing. (That’s exactly what happened in the the 2017 Oroville Dam crisis.)

In the summer, water shortages would impact ecosystems, farmers and hydropower production, the authors wrote. Heat and drought would stress forests, which would likely “experience lower growth and higher susceptibility to fires, insects, and disease.” (This, too, has come to pass.)

The report also warned that climate change would raise sea level, increase electricity demand, worsen air quality, increase heat-related deaths and be a drain on the state’s economy.

“It strikes me that we were right on,” said Kari Smith, now a division manager at the San Jose Clean Energy department who helped oversee the report when she worked at the CEC. “I don’t think there was anything that we said that is radically off-base.”

If anything, she said, the report underestimated the degree to which climate impacts are interrelated. For instance, in 1989, few foresaw that wildfire risk would cause utilities to consider cutting power to thousands of residents, jeopardizing the reliability of electricity.

The report came about after the legislature asked the CEC to assess “the effect of global warming trends on California’s energy, economy, environment, agriculture, and water.”

Soon after, the CEC released the state’s first inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 and a set of climate policy recommendations in 1991.

AB 4420, the 1988 bill that mandated the reports, was introduced by Byron Sher, a Stanford law professor and state politician best known for authoring California’s clean air and safe drinking water acts.

Global warming had just begun to seep into the public consciousness. Alarmed by signs of environmental change and the results of early climate models, scientists were going public with their concerns about what many then called the “greenhouse effect.”

Sher immediately saw the threat to California.

“The heat is on,” he told the Sacramento Bee in 1989. “The state can either ignore what science is telling us or we can respond to this challenge in a responsible way.”

Sher’s bill was part of a flurry of bipartisan political activity on climate change across the country. In his 1988 presidential campaign, George H.W. Bush vowed to combat the greenhouse effect with “the White House effect.”

In Congress, Democrats and Republicans introduced more than a dozen bills to curb atmospheric pollution. Several called for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 20% below 1988 levels by the year 2000. (Around the same time, the world agreed to phase out ozone-destroying substances under an agreement that President Reagan helped negotiate.)

By comparison, AB 4420 was relatively modest, said Kip Lipper, who was Sher’s chief of staff and helped draft the bill.

But AB 4420 had the distinction of actually passing. (The assembly voted 58 to 13 in favor of the bill; the senate voted 38-0.

“It’s the first law enacted anywhere in the United States that used the term ‘global warming,’” said Lipper, who still serves as the chief policy advisor for energy and environment to the president pro tem of the state senate.

Lipper said the report didn’t make a big splash. But it did provide a basis for everything that came later, including the state’s renewable energy portfolio standard and its cap-and-trade program.

“We tried to seed the ground, if you will, by saying, ‘Let’s just get a report. Let’s have this task force look at this,” he said.

It would be 12 years before the next piece of climate legislation passed. And AB 32 — which set the state’s first emissions reduction target — didn’t become law until 2006.

The reasons for the slow response are familiar: the daunting scope of climate change, the challenges of transitioning away from fossil fuels, and tenacious opposition by industry.

But many say there was also uncertainty about the reality of climate change in the 1980s.

While the report found that global warming posed a significant risk to California, it also acknowledged that the matter wasn’t entirely settled. In fact, the authors devoted six pages to “Challenges to the Global Warming Concept.”

Baxter felt that the theory was solid, but that there wasn’t enough evidence that it was happening yet.

“I remember thinking to myself, ‘Well, we’ll know enough in 20 or 25 years,’” he said.

Such reservations made it hard for politicians to push for action, even if they cared deeply about global warming, Smith said. “It was difficult to lead with climate change for a long time because it was considered maybe a little radical.”

Instead, leaders looked for ways to get at climate mitigation by focusing on other objectives, like improving air quality and energy efficiency.

That was a start, but not enough to tackle the problem, she said.

Today, scientists have no doubts about climate change and Californians see the impacts all around them.

“We now have observed data — not projections, nothing speculative — to show climate-related trends that are already affecting the state in ways that were anticipated 30 years ago,” Wilhelm said.

Indeed, if the report’s authors erred in any way, it was that they didn’t anticipate just how fast these changes would occur.

“They thought that we had at least 100 years before it became existential,” Smith said.

“Now, 30 years later, we’re recognizing that it all happened a lot more quickly than we anticipated.”",mainstream,M0ca4c,climate.change; global.warming
731,"To avoid dangerous climate change, the 195 countries that signed the Paris Agreement of 2015 agreed ‘to keep the increase in global mean surface temperature to well below 2° C, and to limit the increase to 1.5° C, since this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change’. To achieve this objective, global emissions should peak as soon as possible and carbon neutrality should be achieved by the second half of the century.

The EU supports these objectives: it aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 % by 2050 compared with 1990 levels, and its Member States each set and pursue national emission reduction targets. In the shorter term, the EU has set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions levels by at least 40 % below 1990 levels by 2030.

Greenhouse gases are emitted through both natural processes and human activities. The primary natural greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is water vapour. However, human activities release large amounts of other greenhouse gases, which increases their atmospheric concentration and enhances the greenhouse effect, thus warming the climate. The main sources of greenhouse gases from human activities are:
• burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) in electricity generation, transport, industry and households (CO );
• land use change and deforestation (CO );
• land filling of waste (methane from decomposition); and

Several EU initiatives aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Having achieved its objectives under the Kyoto Protocol for the period from 2008 to 2012, the EU adopted a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions further, to levels 20 % below those of 1990 by 2020. To achieve this target, a cap was set for the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). For emissions in sectors not covered by the ETS, individual national targets were set under the Effort Sharing Decision. At the same time, the EU has adopted legislation to increase the use of renewable energy, such as wind, solar, hydro and biomass, and to improve the energy efficiency of a wide array of equipment and household appliances. The EU also aims to support the development of carbon capture and storage technologies to trap and store CO emitted by power stations and other large installations.

As part of a framework of climate and energy policies, the EU has set a binding target to cut emissions in the EU territory by 2030 to levels at least 40 % below those in 1990. Emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry have also been incorporated into the EU’s emission reduction efforts. The European Energy Union, which aims to ensure that Europe has secure, affordable and climate-friendly energy, reinforces this objective.

By providing information on climate change in Europe and its Member States, the EEA supports the implementation of European legislation on climate change mitigation, the evaluation of EU policies and the development of long-term mitigation strategies. The EEA provides data, indicators, assessments and reports on greenhouse gas emissions trends, projections, and policies and measures in Europe.

The EEA works closely with EU institutions (for example the European Commission), experts from its European Topic Centre on Climate change Mitigation and Energy (ETC/CME) and its environment information and observation network (Eionet).

Key activities and products include the annual compilation of the official European Union greenhouse gas inventory and the annual assessment of the progress of EU and other European countries towards their climate and energy targets.

The EEA disseminates data and information on greenhouse gas emissions through various viewers, such as the greenhouse gas data viewer. It also maintains a database on national climate change mitigation policies and measures.",mainstream,M07e51,climate.change
542,"The United Nations’ Environment Program released a rather dire report Wednesday concluding that by 2030, global production of fossil fuels — extracted coal, oil and natural gas — would be more than double what we can safely consume if we hope to limit the most severe impacts from human-caused global warming.

In other words, rather than adopting policies and practices to slow the rise in global temperatures, humanity is essentially continuing on the same suicidal course it’s been on for decades. And, of course, Trump administration policies seeking ever more fossil fuel production in the U.S. are exactly opposite of what we need to do.

The Emissions Gap Report is the first U.N. effort to compare projected global emissions with the stated goals of the 2015 Paris agreement, in which world governments acknowledged the looming danger and pledged to take steps to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. The agreement, which aimed to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, was shepherded by the Obama administration; President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the pact would leave the U.S., despite its key role in forging the agreement, as a global outlier, the sole country not a party to it.

The new report extrapolates from emissions data from the U.S. and seven other nations that account for 60% of global fossil fuel production. It also builds on an earlier report that projects that even if nations meet their current commitments under the Paris agreement temperatures would still rise somewhere between 3 and 4 degrees Celsius. Even more troublesome: Global carbon emissions “have remained exactly at the levels projected a decade ago, under the business-as-usual scenarios used in Emissions Gap Reports,” wrote Inger Andersen, executive director of the Environment Program.

That spotlights a key hurdle in making meaningful changes in how we create and consume energy. Too many nations pursue too many policies — from pushing increased fossil fuel production to subsidies for coal, oil and gas industries — that work against their promised reductions in emissions.

There is no easy way to fix this, but there are some pretty clear steps that could be taken, including dropping tax breaks and subsidies for the fuels that are imperiling us, thus letting market prices more accurately reflect the true cost; changing the market itself by using government policies, including carbon taxes, to push a rapid global transition to renewable energy; and helping developing nations whose demands for power are growing to build renewable energy infrastructures that do not rely on fossil fuels.

And we must do this with a sense of urgency, and without deluding ourselves about the fate that awaits us if we do not.",mainstream,M0e289,climate.change
174,"It's become as much a winter tradition as eggnog at Christmas and champagne on New Year's Eve  the first major snowstorm of the year bringing out the climate-change skeptics. And the bona fide blizzard that has frozen much of the Northeast just a few days after winter officially began definitely qualifies as major. But while piles of snow blocking your driveway hardly conjure images of a dangerously warming world, it doesn't mean that climate change is a myth. The World Meteorological Organization recently reported that 2010 is almost certainly going to be one of the three warmest years on record, while 2001 to 2010 is already the hottest decade in recorded history. Indeed, according to some scientists, all of these events may actually be connected.

One theory is that a warmer Arctic may actually lead to colder and snowier winters in the northern mid-latitudes. Even as countries like Britain  suffering through the coldest December on record  deal with low temperatures and unusual snow, the Arctic has kept on warming, with Greenland and Arctic Canada experiencing the hottest year on record. Temperatures in that region have been 5.4°F to 7.2°F (3°C to 4°C) above normal in 2010. As a result, the Arctic sea-ice cover has continued to shrink; this September, the minimum summer sea-ice extent was more than 770,000 sq. mi. (2 million sq km) below the long-term average, and the third-smallest on record. Snow may be piling up in midtown Manhattan, but the Arctic is continuing its long-term meltdown.

The loss of Arctic sea ice helps accelerate the warming of the atmosphere in the far north, thanks to what's known as the albedo effect. White ice reflects sunlight into space, cooling the air, but when ice melts and is replaced with dark ocean water, the effect is reversed and more of the sun's heat is absorbed. As the Arctic air warms, it raises the altitude of discrete areas of high pressure, which can then alter wind patterns. This, in turn, can weaken the jet stream, allowing more cold air to seep out of the Arctic and into Europe and the eastern U.S. As the authors of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's recent ""Arctic Report Card"" put it, ""There is evidence that the effect of higher air temperatures in the lower Arctic atmosphere in fall is contributing to changes in the atmospheric circulation in both the Arctic and northern mid-latitudes. Winter 2009-2010 showed a new connectivity between mid-latitude extreme cold and snowy weather events and changes in the wind patterns of the Arctic; the so-called Warm ArcticCold Continents pattern.""

The theory seems counterintuitive, but as Jeff Masters, a meteorologist who writes the great Wunder Blog at Weather Underground, put it in a recent post, it makes sense: ""This pattern is kind of like leaving the refrigerator door ajar  the refrigerator warms up, but all the cold air spills out into the house."" The planet overall is still warming  and the Arctic fastest of all  but the cold air from the far north can result in biting winter weather and major storms, for a while at least.

That's not the only theory. Judah Cohen, the director of seasonal forecasting at the environmental research firm AER, has written that increasing seasonal snow cover in Siberia may drive extreme winter weather. Even as the planet has continued to warm and the Arctic has melted, seasonal snow cover has increased in Siberia, especially north of high Asian mountain ranges like the Himalayas. (As the climate warms overall, the atmosphere can hold more moisture, which can lead to more precipitation  falling as snow in places like Siberia that remain relatively cold.) All that Siberian snow creates a dome of cold air near the mountains, which bends the passing jet stream. Instead of flowing west to east, the jet stream moves in a more north to south fashion, carrying cold air south from the Arctic in the eastern U.S. and in Europe.

Cohen's theory isn't accepted by all climate and weather scientists, but the National Science Foundation has said that in past years his model has predicted winter weather more accurately than traditional forecasts. Of course, it's important to remember that weather isn't the same as climate  a single storm, or even a single cold winter, can tell us little about the overall climate. Anomalies do happen, and sometimes they dump 20 inches (50 cm) of snow on Central Park. The systems that govern weather on this planet are incredibly complex, and our ability to understand why individual events occur  and to forecast them for the future  is still imperfect.

That more than anything is what drives  and distorts  so much of the stubborn debate over climate change. Just because climate models predict that the planet will continue to heat up in the future as we continue to pour greenhouse-gas emissions into the atmosphere doesn't mean that warming will be a steady, even process. Far from it  and as parts of the planet warm far faster than others, extreme events, including winter ones, may become more common. New Yorkers cursing Al Gore as they dig out their cars should recall this past July  the second hottest month on record in the city.

Unfortunately, that unpredictability is going to make adapting to a warmer world even tougher. As climate change appears to trigger harsher winter events in parts of the world, that's not an effect that will last forever. As the world warms, even cold air from the Arctic or Siberia may not be enough to offset the greenhouse effect, and major snowstorms like the one the Northeast just experienced could be a thing of the past. That might make for less snow shoveling  but on the whole, it won't be a very pleasant planet to live on.

Today restoring coastal mangroves and hillside forests aims to stave off surging seas, landslides, and floods during future storms.

411,"Scotland is already experiencing the effects of climate change, and this brings both risks and opportunities.

Climate projections for the next century indicate that climate trends observed over the last century will not only continue, but are likely to intensify.

Adapting to climate change will be necessary regardless of how much we manage to cut our emissions, as historic emissions have already changed our climate and will continue to do so in decades to come.

The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 placed a duty on ministers to lay a programme for climate change adaptation before the Scottish Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (UKCCRA), the latest of which includes a summary report for Scotland.

The Act also requires an annual report on progress and for the advisory body, the Committee for Climate Change Adaptation Sub Committee (ASC), to prepare a report within two years, setting out its independent assessment of the progress made on objectives, proposals and policies set out in the programme.

The second Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme (SCCAP) to help prepare for the impact of climate change was launched in September 2019. It addresses the risks set out in the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (UK CCRA) 2017, published under section 56 of the UK Climate Change Act 2008.

The SCCAP’s outcomes-based approach is derived from both the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Scotland’s National Performance Framework. The programme has been aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals to ensure it complements our international ambitions. Its launch coincided with a United Nations Climate Action summit in New York.

The first SCCAP was launched in May 2014, with the aim of increasing the resilience of Scotland's people, environment and economy to the impacts of a changing climate. The ASC's first independent assessment of the first SCCAP recognised the SCCAP as a positive start in taking steps to prepare for climate change. The final assessment of the first SCCAP was published in March 2019 and found that there had been notable progress since the first assessment, but there was still some continuing concern and gaps remaining in key evidence and data, which it expected to be considered in the second SCCAP.

We have published annual progress reports since 2015. The first annual progress report on the second SCCAP was published in May 2020 and can be viewed below:

The EESC produces opinions that cover a wide range of issues such as climate justice, a fair transition to a low-carbon economy and the need for multi-stakeholder, multi-level climate governance collaboration. The EESC takes part in the annual UNFCCC Conferences of the Parties and in climate-oriented civil society summits that bring together non-state players.",mainstream,M10fe9,climate.change
49,"Let’s be honest: “Last year was one of the hottest years ever recorded” has become a common story. It’s news in the same way the most popular boys’ baby names are news. (Wow, dear, did you see James won again?) The climate scientist Joseph Majkut quipped that the tone of this year’s announcement was less “See, see we told you” and more “Well, duh.”

Schmidt, the NASA scientist, nodded at this during the briefing. “The fact is, the planet is warming, and every year we add one extra data point to this graph, which may not seem like a terribly important thing, but people seem interested,” he said. “The main thing here is not the ranking … but the consistency of the long-term trend we’re seeing.” Virtually every important climate record has been broken and re-broken over the past few years: The past five years are the five warmest years on record, the past six the warmest six, the past nine the warmest nine. Since Donald Trump rode down his gilded escalator and announced he was running for president, the world has experienced its hottest recorded version of each individual month, according to NOAA.

So it’s worth going back in history to see just how outlandish our current situation is. The median American is a little more than 38 years old. The year before she was born was 1980. It was, at the time, the hottest year ever measured. A July heat wave that year killed 1,265 Americans and caused more than $20 billion in damage nationwide.

The larger significance of this milestone was not well understood at the time. In an op-ed that summer, a weatherman in Westchester, New York, expressed so much regret about giving in and buying a car with an air conditioner that he wondered whether Americans of his demographic were “less tolerant of extreme heat than our parents and grandparents.” His parents’ generation made do without air-conditioned cars, he figured, and his grandparents didn’t even have electric ceiling fans. Were they a tougher breed?

They were not, he learned: The weather had gotten warmer. He was shocked. “It came as a great surprise to discover that during the first three decades of this century there were fewer heat waves (27) than during the last three (49),” he wrote in The New York Times. “My hat is off to the present generation … If we create our own cooler environment with air conditioners, well then, we deserve it.”

His editorial did not mention global warming or “the greenhouse effect,” as it was then called. And the hottest-year record probably did seem like a fluke: 1980 was the first time the record had been broken in 35 years.

In 1981, the median American was born, a happy and healthy statistical girl. The planet inched even hotter, setting a new all-time record a few hundredths of a degree Celsius warmer than 1980’s. Then, in 1983, as she learned to string sentences together, the record was smashed again. The global hottest-year record had now been broken three times in four years.",mainstream,M101c8,climate.change
428,"Beto Doubles Down on Gun Confiscation: 'It’s Not Voluntary, it’s Mandatory'

2020 hopeful Beto O'Rourke doubled down on his promise to ban every semi-automatic rifle in America despite a backlash.

O'Rourke rejected the idea that the gun confiscation would involve Americans voluntarily handing over their legally purchased firearms.

""It's not voluntary. It's mandatory."" O'Rourke said.

But O'Rourke avoided answering the question regarding how far he would go on enforcing such a law.

He also avoided questions on whether federal agents would come to people's homes to confiscate their firearms.

""I'm going to work with ... law enforcement to make sure that we implement this in the most effective way possible,"" O'Rourke said.

""It is mandatory. It will be the law. You will be required to comply with the law,"" O'Rourke restated.

""As with many of our laws, we don't go door to door searching people's homes to see if they are, in fact, breaking the law. We expect people to comply with the law.""

When the former Texas congressman was asked how he would confiscate people's legally purchased rifles, he said he intended to change the law.

""We are going to change the law so it will no longer be legal to hold one these,"" he said.

As NewsThud reported, when the 2020 Democratic hopeful was asked whether he would confiscate Americans' guns during the ABC News Democratic debate Thursday, and he answered, “hell yes.”

“Some of the stage have suggested a voluntary buy-back for guns in this country. You have said, ‘Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.’ You know that critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns and how would this work?” ABC’s David Muir asked.

“I am, if it’s a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield. If the high impact, high velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that so you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers,” O’Rourke continued.

Also during the debate, O’Rourke claimed that President Donald Trump was responsible for the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas last month.

Beto claimed, without evidence, that the horrific attack that killed 22 people and injured 24 others shows “just how dangerous Donald Trump is.”

The Democratic 2020 candidate went so far as to state that the El Paso shooter was “inspired to kill” by President Trump:

“On August 3rd, in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me, and I think produced a turning point for this country,"" Beto said.

168,"Gone are the days when children worried about monsters under their bed at night, now it is the climate crisis outside that is giving them nightmares.

A new survey reveals one in five children are having bad dreams about the environmental changes, with 17 percent reporting their concerns are affecting their sleeping and eating habits.

The poll also shows 80 percent say the problem was important to them and nearly half do not trust adults to tackle the long-term problems.

The study, conducted by BBC Newsround in collaboration with Savanta-ComRes, surveyed 2,000 children in the UK from the ages of eight to 16 in a bid to see just how the younger generation feels about the changes to our planet.

Over the past year, millions of young people have flooded the streets of cities around the world demanding political leaders take urgent steps to stop climate change, inspired by 17-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.

The BBC Newsround conducted the new survey to know understand how the young generation feels about the impact climate change could have on their future.

The poll found that 73 percent of the participants are in constant worry about the planet's current state, including 22 percent who are 'very worried'.

Many adults have noted that the disastrous effects may not become a reality for many years, but it seems our children may be the ones to suffer the consequences.

Almost three in five, about 58 percent, of children are concerned about what climate changes means for their future.

And approximately 19 percent shared they are having nightmares about the climate crisis.

When questioned about the action being taken by grown-ups to tackle the problem, a large number of children said they feel frustrated about the progress being made.

Emma Citron, a consultant clinical child psychologist, said that young people often find it difficult to come to terms with the scale of the problem of climate changes and what often seems like a lack of response shown by governments and world leaders.

'Public figures like David Attenborough and Greta Thunberg have helped young people to voice their worries and we have to make sure that we as adults listen to them and ... help them become involved in positive change,' she said in a statement.

'We all need to support them not to feel hopeless but rather to present to them hopeful and balanced messages about their futures and ensure that they get the right professional help if their anxiety is unduly high.'

The American Psychological Association has said it was aware of reports of growing 'eco-anxiety' in children, but research was needed to establish how common it was.

Britain's Oxford Dictionaries recorded a 4,290 percent increase in the term 'eco-anxiety' in 2019, particularly among young people.

In September 2019, millions of people including hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren took to the streets in 150 different countries for the largest climate protest in history.

Global Strike 4 Climate Change' protesters were photographed in Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, India, Bangladesh, Uganda, Kenya, the Solomon Island, Cyprus, Poland, Germany and London and those living in America joined later in the day.

The protests were part of a snowballing movement sparked by teenage activist Greta Thunberg's school strikes outside the Swedish parliament.

It came ahead of a climate action summit in New York convened by UN secretary general Antonio Guterres to urge countries to up their climate efforts.

Much steeper measures are needed across the globe to prevent temperature rises of more than 1.5C (2.7F) or 2C (3.6F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

1272,"Despite the Internet, connectivity, and linking technologies, distance has not shrunk the Australian sense of self, an often provincial appraisal of the world seen in slow motion and stills. Whether it’s the “flower revolution” or Michel Foucault, trends and ideas are often delayed, and seem almost cutely anachronistic by the time they make landfall down under. Wedded to the insatiable urge to reap, rent and remove from the earth, and you have the ultimate myopic: Australia, the exceptional country, outside the stream of history and, dare it be said, the inconveniences of science.

With some 11,000 scientists warning that planet Earth “clearly and unequivocally faces a climate emergency”, some sense of it was registered on the Australian political scene, if only barely. The “World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency” published in BioScience does not shy away from the language of catastrophe and emergency. “Despite 40 years of global climate negotiations… we have generally conducted business as usual and have largely failed to address this predicament.” Climate change had not merely arrived but bulldozed itself into recognition, “accelerating faster than many scientists expected.”

The authors and signatories suggest that, “An immense increase of scale in endeavours to conserve our biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to the climate crisis.” Public debates on the subject of climate change had mostly focused on global surface temperature, a clearly inadequate approach that avoids “the breath of human activities and the real dangers stemming from a warming planet.”

Areas of urgent redress were also suggested. Energy efficiency and a reduction in the use of fossil fuels are high on the list. “We need a carbon-free economy that explicitly addresses human dependence on the biosphere and policies that guide economic decisions accordingly.” The call for a change of language is encouraged: rhetoric of GDP growth and affluence needs to be replaced by sustainability “and improving human well-being by prioritizing basic needs and reducing inequality.” Not exactly music for the muscular fossil fuel lobby.

Another song sheet that would not have impressed the fossil fuel industries was an event that barely disturbed the press releases. This month, the National Electricity Market in Australia received a contribution from wind, solar and hydro energy amounting to half of the total energy production. Rooftop solar contributions came in at 23.7 percent, with wind (15.7 percent), large-scale solar (8.8 percent) and hydro (1.9 percent) bringing up the rear.

With the release of the report, Australia braced itself for the incinerating fury of bush fires that have arrived earlier this season. The state of New South Wales is anticipating what the Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons describes as “the most dangerous bushfire week this nation has ever seen”.

The warnings were already pressing through the policy pipeline in the last decade. The National Inquiry on Bushfire Mitigation and Management’s 2004 report to the Council of Australian Government warned that, “Fires’ frequency, intensity and size are expected to increase under climate change as temperatures rise, rainfall variability increases, droughts become more severe and ecosystem dynamics alter, resulting in changed biomass fuel loads and types.”

The authors of the report go on to suggest that “projected hotter, drier and windier conditions associated with climate change caused by greenhouse warming would extend the period of fuel drying and increase rates of fire spread.”

Earlier this year, former NSW Fires Chief Greg Mullins and 22 other emergency honchos warned Prime Minister Morrison of the dangers that would face Australia this summer, suggesting that the government meet to discuss some form of action against risks of conflagration. The meeting has yet to take place, leaving such politicians as Adam Bandt, the Greens MP for Melbourne, certain that Morrison “bears some responsibility and must apologise to the communities impacted”.

Various Australian politicians, as then, were having none of it. Charged with the task of keeping a plunderer’s lifestyle in perpetuity, the well-fed pigs in clover, the following words of the BioScience report sit uncomfortably with members of the Morrison government. “The climate crisis is closely linked to excessive consumption of the wealthy lifestyle. The most affluent countries are mainly responsible for the historical GHG emissions and generally have the greatest per capita emissions.”

The Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack preferred some tea and sympathy in responding to the victims of the fires, not policy and prognosis. “They don’t need the ravings of some pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies at this time when they are trying to save their homes.”

McCormack’s primary target was the Green party itself, which he accused of fiddling politically while Australia burned. “That’s what Adam Bandt, and the Greens, and Richard Di Natale, and all those other inner-city raving lunatics – and quite frankly, that’s how he was carrying on yesterday – that’s what they want, we’re not going to go down that path.”

Other politicians have adopted a similar approach: the now is what matters, and never mind previous failings and future disasters. NSW Premier Gladys Berejikilian provided the stellar example. “For any of us on the ground, speaking to people traumatised, speaking to people fighting fires for weeks… know exactly what the priorities should be, and that is saving life and property”. Climate change, in other words, was something for another day, another slot in the packed meeting schedule.

Morrison reiterated the position. He was “focused on the needs of the people”. He spoke of having “firefighters out there saving someone else’s house while their own house is burning down, and when we are in that sort of situation, that is where attention must be.”

Mayors from the areas most affected by the recent conflagration have been crankily unimpressed by the platitudes. Climate change literature, they surmise, is being assiduously avoided by the government. The unfortunately named Carol Sparks, Mayor of Glen Innes, site of two deaths over the weekend, suggested that McCormack needed “to read the science, and that is what I am going by, is the science.” Forget, suggested the mayor, the politics here. Science had imposed its cold, objective hand on the matter. Mid Coast Mayor Claire Pontin was similarly riled, notably by suggestions that fires were the staple of Australian life and landscape. “We’ve not had situations like that. Fifty years ago, this would never happen.”

There are few incentives for humanity to adapt than through the infliction of catastrophic conditions. Pandemics, world wars and existential risk have done their bit in propelling change. But luxury produces complacency; well fed bellies induce sloth. Come the writing of humanity’s extensive biography of preying on the planet, Australia and its political classes will have much to answer for.

868,"THE world may have already crossed nine key ""tipping points"" that will lead to catastrophic climate change, scientists warn.

Passing the alarming milestones means ""we are in a state of planetary emergency"" that could see humanity wiped from the planet.

So much damage has been done in the nine outlined areas that the effects of global warming could accelerate and create a deadly domino effect, researchers wrote in the journal Nature.

Points of no return picked out by the team include the loss of the Amazon rainforest and the great ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland – damage from which our planet may never recover.

""A decade ago we identified a suite of potential tipping points in the Earth system,"" said lead author Professor Tim Lenton, from the University of Exeter.

""Now we see evidence that over half of them have been activated.""

The team, made up of top researchers from the UK, Germany, Denmark and Australia, said urgent action was needed to reduce emissions before further milestones are passed.

""The growing threat of rapid, irreversible changes means it is no longer responsible to wait and see,"" Professor Lenton said.

""The situation is urgent and we need an emergency response.""

A tipping point is reached when certain impacts of global warming become unstoppable, such as heavy ice loss in Antarctica.

Among the nine tipping points outlined by scientists were thawing of permafrost in Russia, large-scale die-offs of coral and a slowdown of ocean currents in the Atlantic.

Droughts in the Amazon rainforest and fires in the far north of Canada and Russia were also said to be key crossroads identified a decade ago that are now ""active"".

Due to the way our planet's ecosystem is connected, as each tipping point is reached, others not currently active are pushed closer to the brink.

""It is not only human pressures on Earth that continue rising to unprecedented levels,"" said study coauthor Professor Johan Rockström, of the Potsdam Institute in Germany.

""As science advances, we must admit that we have underestimated the risks of unleashing irreversible changes, where the planet self-amplifies global warming.""

This cascade of changes sparked by global warming could threaten the existence of human civilisations, according to the researchers.

The collapse of major ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica alone would drive sea levels up by 10 metres, turfing millions in coastal areas from their homes.

Changes to Atlantic currents have already triggered more frequent and destructive hurricanes across the western world.

In the past, it was thought that the planet would need to heat up by 5C for Earth's tipping points to be reached.

However, evidence shows we have already started to hit them between 1C and 2C.

Earth has heated by around 1C since pre-industrial temperatures, a figure that is certain to rise in the coming decades.

""Scientifically, this provides strong evidence for declaring a state of planetary emergency,"" Professor Rockström added.

""We must unleash world action that accelerates the path towards a world that can continue evolving on a stable planet.""

Nearly 200 countries signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, pledging to keep global warming below 2C.

However, current national emissions pledges – even if they are met – would lead to 3C of warming.

Experts argued that further international action was needed, as it could slow the impacts of climate change, giving more time for people to adapt.

Professor Lenton added: ""We might already have crossed the threshold for a cascade of inter-related tipping points.

""However, the rate at which they progress, and therefore the risk they pose, can be reduced by cutting our emissions.""

His team concluded in their paper: ""If damaging tipping cascades can occur and a global tipping cannot be ruled out, then this is an existential threat to civilisation.""

""A saving grace is that the rate at which damage accumulates from tipping could still be under our control to some extent.

""The stability and resilience of our planet is in peril. International action – not just words – must reflect this.""

In other news, shocking photos this week revealed how Swiss glaciers have nearly disappeared since the 1800s.

Seaside towns were recently urged by experts to ""move inland"" as climate change meant a retreat was needed.

842,"Climate change is the biggest challenge facing humanity today. The associated global warming and humidification, increases in the severity and frequency of extreme climate events, extension of the ranges of vector‐borne diseases, and the consequent social and economic stresses and disruption will have major negative consequences on many aspects of health care. People whose resilience to change is already impaired may suffer disproportionately from these environmental changes, which are of unprecedented reach and magnitude. There has been little connection made so far between climate change and epilepsy. We briefly review the history of climate change science and the subsequent response of the global scientific community. We consider how climate change effects might in general affect health and disease. We consider some of the underlying complex interactions that, for example, favor the spread of vector‐borne diseases and how climate models operate and may help plan for global and local changes. We then speculate specifically on how these generic ideas may apply specifically to epilepsy. We consider these impacts at levels from molecular to the epidemiological. Data are sparse, and there is undoubtedly a need for more information to enable better estimation of possible effects of climate change on care in epilepsy. We also consider how the professional activities of those involved in epilepsy health care might contribute to global carbon emissions, for example, through flying for conference attendance. Healthcare organizations across the world are already considering, and responding to, many of these issues. We argue for more research in this area, but also for action today. Actions today are likely to generate cobenefits for health care, including care in epilepsy, resulting from efforts to decarbonize, mitigate effects of climate change that has already happened, and plan for adaptation to climate change.

Climate change, dominated by climate warming, is accepted by the majority of informed authorities as a clear feature of the Anthropocene era, and is becoming the lived experience shared by many of us globally, as we comment with increasing frequency about the unseasonal weather and the environment transforming around us. The effects of climate change will be pervasive, with no sphere of human endeavor likely to be untouched. As the 5th assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states: “Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long‐lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.”1 The risks to human health posed by climate change have already received extensive attention. The fourth edition, published in 2018, of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change stated climate change was “the biggest global health threat of the 21st century,” warning that failure to take action could lead to disasters that “disrupt core public health infrastructure and overwhelm health services.”2 A further Lancet commission report details the interaction between significant healthcare challenges (a “syndemic”), working as multipliers that exacerbate unitary global challenges, such as obesity, undernutrition, and climate change.3 Several authorities and organizations have launched programs around the effects of climate change. The Global Climate and Health Alliance, formed in 2011, “works to tackle climate change and to protect and promote public health” and provides useful links and resources (http://climateandhealthalliance.org/). Several international groups, nations, and regions have their own healthcare initiatives focused on climate change, such as the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health in the United States (https://medsocietiesforclimatehealth.org/), the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change (http://www.ukhealthalliance.org/), Doctors for the Environment Australia (https://www.dea.org.au/), the Regional Institute of Health Medicine and Research (Rajasthan, India) (http://www.rihmr.org/), the European Environment and Health Youth Coalition (http://www.eehyc.org/), and the UK NHS (https://www.sduhealth.org.uk/policy-strategy/reporting/nhs-carbon-footprint.aspx), carbon emissions from which are estimated to account for between 4% and 6% of the total UK carbon footprint. The World Health Organization has made clear the health benefits of mitigating climate change far outweigh the costs.4 The US healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente announced in 2018 that it would become carbon neutral by 2020.5 Funders are increasingly supporting research into the health effects of climate change, typically with a focus on mitigation strategies. It seems unlikely that any human disease area will escape the pervasive anticipated and unforeseen consequences of climate change. Noting that the epilepsies are strongly influenced by environmental factors, we wished to start to consider how climate change might affect the epilepsies, to raise awareness within the epilepsy community of these issues, and to facilitate and promote efforts by people affected by epilepsy, families and carers, and epilepsy professionals, to begin to address what action we can take. Individuals may already be taking steps in their own private lives, for example, by working out their own carbon footprint (https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/ ‐ a very easy to use and enlightening tool) and taking effective actions.6 Patients, clinicians, and scientists across the world, as a community, may have ideas and initiatives for shared observations and mitigation measures to reduce the potential added burden of climate change for those with epilepsy. We here consider the history of climate change, review the current state of science and global efforts to tackle climate change, describe how climate change can affect human health and disease, and then address the particular impacts there may be on the epilepsies, how health care in the epilepsies might contribute to climate change, what can be done to mitigate the effects, and how progress might be achieved.

2 CLIMATE CHANGE: A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE HISTORY AND CURRENT STATUS Climate change science has a much longer history than most people realize, dating back to the 19th century when Joseph Fourier recognized that the Earth's atmosphere kept the planet warmer than would be the case in a vacuum. He effectively discovered the greenhouse effect: the passage of visible light waves through the atmosphere to the earth's surface, their absorption, and re‐emission as infrared radiation, which can then be absorbed by certain types of gases in the atmosphere, increasing surface temperatures. Eunice Newton Foote was the first to suggest that the warming effect of the sun would be increased in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO : then called “carbonic acid”). Her work was presented by Professor Joseph Henry at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in August 1856. John Tyndall then examined the absorption of infrared radiation in different gases, discovering the greenhouse gases (GHG) CO , methane, and water vapor in 1859. Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius was the first to link human activity to global warming. In 1896, he published “On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Earth,” calculating that a doubling of atmospheric CO (now called the “climate sensitivity” ) would give a total warming of 5‐6°C. In later work, he revised this downward to 4°C.7 This is not dissimilar to the range reported by the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report from the latest generation of global climate models. Events then jump almost 100 years to the modern era when the first conference on climate change, a joint United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)/World Meteorological Organization (WMO)/International Council for Science (ICSU) Conference on the ""Assessment of the Role of Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gases in Climate Variations and Associated Impacts,"" in 1985 concluded that GHG ""are expected"" to cause significant warming in the next century. This led to the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988, whose role is to “assess the scientific, technical and socio‐economic information relevant for the understanding of the risk of human‐induced climate change,” and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an international environmental treaty adopted on May 9, 1992. The IPCC has issued a series of Assessment Reports once every 5‐6 years—published in 1990 (First Assessment Report: FAR), 1995 (Second Assessment Report: SAR), 2001 (Third Assessment Report: TAR), 2007 (Fourth Assessment Report: AR4), and 2013/2014 (Fifth Assessment Report: AR5)—and supplemental and special topic reports that describe the state of scientific understanding at the time each report is prepared. Although there have now been five Assessment Reports (and the 6th is under construction), the range of potential warming with a doubling of atmospheric CO has not changed substantially from the estimate made with quite simple climate models in the FAR, or indeed by Arrhenius in 1896, with both the FAR and AR5 suggesting a range from 1.5 to 4.5°C. Alongside this, the UNFCCC objective is to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."" The framework sets nonbinding limits on GHG emissions for individual countries, with no enforcement mechanisms. An annual Conference of the Parties (COP) assesses progress in dealing with climate change, and these have occurred since 1995, with many producing specific international treaties (“agreements” or “protocols”) around GHG emissions. This history includes (a) the Kyoto protocol—a legally binding agreement that industrialized countries will reduce their emissions of GHGs, adopted in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan; (b) the Copenhagen Accord (2009), which recognized climate change as one of the greatest challenges of the present day and suggested actions should be taken to keep temperature increases to below 2°C; however, the document was not legally binding and does not contain any binding commitments for reducing CO emissions; (c) the Durban Platform (2011), which included a decision to adopt a legally binding treaty on climate change; the treaty terms were to be set out by 2015 and become effective in 2020 and for the first time, it included developing countries and the United States; and (d) the Paris Agreement (2015) was a climate change accord agreed by ~200 countries in December 2015 that came into force on November 4, 2016, committing world leaders to keeping global warming below 2°C and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5°C. Carbon emission curbs are not legally binding, but the framework of the accord, including a mechanism for periodically increasing pledges, is binding. Since the FAR, the understanding of human influence on warming has improved through better earth observations and earth system modeling, with the AR5 stating that: (a) “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia""8; (b) ""Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800 000 years""8; and (c) “Human influence on the climate system is clear…It is extremely likely (95%‐100% probability) that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951‐2010.”8 Special reports such as the recent SR159 (global warming of 1.5°C) examined the difference in impacts between 1.5 and 2°C warming, suggesting that limiting warming to 1.5°C “is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes” with “‘rapid and far‐reaching’ transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities.” A 1.5°C limit would require global net anthropogenic CO emissions to decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050. To limiting global warming to below 2°C, CO emissions will need to decline by about 20% by 2030 and reach net zero around 2075. We are already living in a 1°C warmer world. The SR159 states “we are already seeing the consequences of 1°C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes … By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10 cm lower with global warming of 1.5°C compared with 2°C,”; and moreover, “Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate (high confidence).” If we continue on our current emission trajectory, then we are likely to reach 2.6‐4.8°C warming by 2100, with recent modeling results suggesting that the higher climate sensitivities could be more likely. In terms of personal emission targets, average personal emissions in 2010 were around 5 tons per person and to reach the 2°C target would require reduction to around 1.5 tons by 2050.10 This is very ambitious and of is of course based on an equal sharing of emissions across the global population. In reality, the rich, Westernized nations use much more carbon per person than the poorer nations.10 There is the potential for major reduction in personal carbon footprints in the Western world typically by reducing the major contributors of car travel, heating, electricity use, and flying.

Existing variability in weather influences human health. For example, during clear summer days there is an increased occurrence of sunburn and Lyme disease, while during the winter, there is increased influence of influenza and falls. As climate change will influence weather, particularly weather extremes, then impacts on human health are likely. Hence, there has been an interest in the likely influence of climate change on human health for over 30 years, with a significant body of work now available on the health impacts of climate change.11-15 Climate change may lead to multiple health impacts acting through a variety of different pathways, as shown conceptually in Figure 1. Pathways through which climate change may influence health. Climate change will affect mean weather, such as rainfall amounts and temperature. In addition to changing average conditions, it may also increase variability and extremes (eg, more intense rainfall events). The latter is probably of most consequence for human health. Although globally, interannual temperature has not increased in variability,16 there is evidence of regional changes in extremes,17,18 as both the mean climate and climate variability shift in response to anthropogenic forcings (Figure 2). These shifts in weather will be moderated by local environmental conditions and human adaptation, leading to changes in three broad categories of exposure that have the potential to influence health. The first are direct effects such as the influence of a heatwave upon mortality.19 The second are indirect exposures such as changing weather altering the growing season and distribution of plants, affecting pollen production, which in turn impacts on allergic disease20; other examples include changing weather patterns affecting mosquito breeding and life cycles, leading to changes in malaria and dengue fever (see below).21 Changes in temperature and humidity alter the geography of vector‐borne diseases, by shifting vector breeding sites22 and altering the transmission windows of vector‐borne diseases.23 In many cases, more data are needed to characterize the relationships between vector, pathogen, and climate.24,25 Third, climate change may act through economic and social disruption, for example, leading to mental health effects from extreme events such as flooding26 or influencing global crop yields leading to increased hunger.27 Flooding, whether coastal, fluvial, or pluvial, carries direct risks of drowning28 as well as a range of health risks in the aftermath of the event, including the spread of water‐borne diseases,29 and the spread of microbial contaminants in buildings.30 The risk of exacerbating existing medical conditions, through disrupted access to medicines and medical facilities, is also a concern. Schematic showing the effect on extreme temperatures when (A) the mean temperature increases, (B) the variance increases, and (C) when both the mean and variance increase for a normal distribution of temperature However, changing exposure to extreme weather does not automatically lead to health impacts, and the gray box in Figure 1 highlights the important moderating influence that health care and wider public health capability can have in ameliorating potential impacts. Put simply, appropriate health care and public health input can reduce health impacts. It is important to recognize that these capabilities are dynamic over time. Furthermore, they can respond (ie, adapt) to new situations. One prominent example of such an adaptation occurred in response to the 2003 European heatwave during which over 70 000 additional deaths were recorded.19 City dwellers are at particular risk of heat stress given the urban heat island effect.31 Modeling suggests that in summer 2003, when an estimated 735 people died of causes relating to extreme heat in central Paris, anthropogenic climate change increased the risk of heat‐related mortality by approximately 70%,32 illustrating the scale of the issue. In response, many European countries developed early warning systems for heatwaves and national advice and guidelines on adaptation to reduce potential health impacts.33 Adapting public health capabilities will play an important role in responding to climate change. The arrows in Figure 1 indicate feedback mechanisms between societal infrastructure, public health, and adaptation measures and climate change. Measures to reduce health impacts may also reduce GHG emissions. Examples include the health and environmental cobenefits of low carbon diets.34,35

Much of our understanding of likely impacts from climate change in the coming decades comes from climate models. Atmosphere‐Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs)36 use the laws of physics to compute atmospheric, oceanic, and other environmental variables, and represent different processes and interactions in the climate system, at a series of evenly spaced “cells” or unit areas around the globe. Although important tools in our understanding, they are complex and require considerable computational resource to run. For this reason, the cells used by state‐of‐the‐art global climate models typically span a large area in order to reduce the number of calculations required: in turn, the outputs generated are coarse. While these outputs are useful for identifying global and regional trends, we need to adapt them for local use (eg, to assess the likely impacts of climate change in a particular coastal city or tropical community). This is accomplished using “downscaling” methods,37,38 which involve using either statistical approaches or a higher resolution model over a limited area to add greater detail.39,40 Unlike short‐term weather forecasts, which are dependent on the initial state of the atmosphere, longer‐term projections from climate models are largely dependent on trajectories of global development and on how fluctuating concentrations of GHGs impact the balance of sunlight absorbed by the Earth and energy radiated back into space. Thus, these longer‐term projections are subject to substantial uncertainty not related to the climate system. In the most recent model simulations, these trajectories are characterized by the representative concentration pathways (RCPs),41 a comprehensive dataset of changes to the Earth's energy balance under different possible futures. However, even when models are run with the same RCP, intermodel variability arises due to differences in how models represent processes, leading to different projected future climate states. For this reason, a multimodel ensemble is often used, in which uncertainty is considered to be represented by the spread of model projections. The various choices and inferences made at each stage of the modeling process can therefore yield a substantial envelope of uncertainty in local impacts. Yet, despite these uncertainties, consistent findings with relevance for epilepsy emerge. For instance, models agree exceptionally well on estimates of heat stress metrics, which combine temperature and humidity.42 Furthermore, each generation of models represents an advance in our understanding of climate processes and a refinement of modeled processes. For example, for a number of extreme temperature indices, the spread among the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models (CMIP5; CMIP is a collaborative framework for supporting assessments of climate change and fostering model development, in which international modeling groups perform simulations based on preagreed scientific objectives, generating a database of model outputs with common standards) is less than the spread among the previous generation CMIP3 models, even though the project now contains more models.43 The burden of many of these changes will be felt by those least equipped to adapt. Models project increases in temperature variability in Amazonia, Southern Africa, the Sahel, India, and South‐East Asia over the coming decades.44 In India, models also indicate an intensification of heatwaves, with areas that do not currently experience heatwaves becoming severely affected this century.45 Thus, models can help us understand where we can expect the effects of climate change to be most marked and what those effects might be, in turn helping us plan for the likely challenges that will need to be addressed for health care in general, and epilepsy in particular.

As the climate changes, we can expect there to be particular implications for epilepsy. These impacts might manifest at the level of altered risk of epilepsy per se, altered risk of seizures in established epilepsy, consequences for epilepsy treatments, and outcomes, with effects more likely to affect those not favored in the first place by geography and economics. We can expect inequalities in epilepsy health care to be further exacerbated. Climate warming leads to spread of vectors for infections, which is already being reported, and more can be anticipated. Climate‐driven hyperthermia, fevers, food and water stress, and starvation may further compound other difficulties as well as being directly relevant themselves. Moreover, while humans are remarkably adaptable and have found niches in almost every terrestrial environment, climate change will superimpose unprecedented rates and types of change. A number of vector‐borne infections can cause epilepsy or seizures in the acute phase. Chikungunya virus infection is associated with seizures as part of a multisystem acute illness in 10% of patients,46 while there are case reports of epilepsy as part of the chronic sequelae of neonatal chikungunya encephalitis.47 Epilepsia partialis continua has been reported with dengue encephalitis.48 Vertical Zika virus infection can lead to epilepsy even in the absence of microcephaly,49 and the epilepsy is typically drug‐resistant.50 If climate change leads to a spread of the vector carrying the infectious agent, then there will be an accompanying risk of spread of infection‐related epilepsy or acute seizures. Predictions are difficult, because the impact of climate change on vectors is multifactorial, and may be further compounded by multiplier effects as well as actions taking to mitigate its effects. It is already the case that the climate‐sensitive diseases affect the poorest populations the most, with higher prevalence and greater mortality, for several reasons.51 Outbreaks of vector‐borne infections can easily overwhelm healthcare systems, for example, as shown by recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses, and emergence of infections in naïve populations or those that have lost immunity can be even more dangerous. Many factors related to climate change can alter vector ranges, survival, biting behavior, pathogen infection capacity, and thus ultimately the risk of disease in humans. Changes in rainfall patterns, drought‐rain cycles, and flood magnitude and frequency can all have effects, while human strategies to combat climate change, such as reestablishment of wetlands and green spaces, can, perversely, promote vector spread. Accounting for these effects in model simulations is particularly challenging, but preliminary studies suggest, for example, that climate change will favor the spread of dengue fever and other arthropod‐borne infections given the temperature sensitivity of many factors favoring the spread of infection.52 Environmental, especially urban, effects of climate change might lead to the spread of cysticercosis,53 neurological involvement from which is a major cause of epilepsy globally. A study focusing on the risk of spread of vector‐borne disease in the UK resulting from climate change suggests that a 1°C rise in temperature would permit Chikungunya virus transmission for 1‐3 months of the year across most of southeast England by 2071‐2100, with changes in transmission ranges also found for a range of other arthropods.52 Malaria is caused by five species of Plasmodium transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. In malaria‐endemic areas, up to 90% of the population may have parasites detectable in their blood. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are associated with seizures and epilepsy,54 particularly seizures during acute infections, and development of epilepsy has been documented following severe falciparum malaria. In addition, there is evidence that asymptomatic malaria parasitemia can precipitate seizures in those with epilepsy.55 There are many models of the effect of climate change on the transmission of malaria, with the most significant and consistent effects predicted to occur in the highlands in Africa and parts of South America and South‐East Asia.56 In other regions, the effect of climate change on malaria transmission may be minimal due to improved control measures and socioeconomic factors, although the present decline in malaria transmission across the world depends on continued support for the current control measures. However, significant uncertainties exist in these models, particularly in the areas that experience malaria epidemics. Furthermore, most of these models examined the effect of climate change on mosquitoes that carry P falciparum , but it is the Anopheles species that transmit P vivax (particularly Anopheles atroparvus ) that are most likely to increase seizures and epilepsy in Europe.57 For example, in one model, a medium‐high scenario of climate change predicts that the southern half of Great Britain will be climatically suitable for P vivax malaria transmission by 2030 and by 2080 even southern Scotland will be climatically suitable for 2 months of the year.58 Phenomena other than infections are also worsening with climate change. As conflicts arise, we can expect more head injuries as another cause of epilepsy. A study from a highly polluted city in China suggests that transient increases in air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide are associated with increased hospital visits for epilepsy, supporting findings from another study from Chile that reported an increased risk of hospitalization for epilepsy with increases in air pollutants.59 Another study identified a tentative link between higher relative air humidity and an increased risk of admission for an epileptic seizure (though higher ambient temperature was associated with a lower risk).60 These are preliminary studies that suggest the relationships, if correct, are complex with a need for more data. But, there is certainly a prevailing view that the outlook strongly favors strategies to forestall climate change rather than trying to deal with the consequences on epilepsy and seizures of the complicated environmental changes that will occur due to climate change. Temperature can affect genes and proteins. Most genetic epilepsies are due to dysfunctional channels. As in much of epilepsy genetics, SCN1A is among the best studied in this regard. Some mutations in SCN1A that can cause epilepsy lead to defective folding of the encoded channel: Mutant channel insertion into a cell surface is temperature‐sensitive, for example, with increased insertion and current density at 30°C compared to 37°C.61 Mutations in SCN1A can cause the rare, severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy Dravet syndrome. While the effect of such dynamic changes in the context of prolonged periods of higher ambient temperature in thermoregulating humans is difficult to predict, empirical and modeling data show direct effects of higher temperatures on sodium channel biophysical properties and neuronal dynamics.62 Elevated ambient temperatures due to hot baths increase seizure frequency in Dravet syndrome.63 Anecdotally, the UK Dravet syndrome patient support group reported that during the sustained atypical high ambient temperatures of the summer of 2018, affected children experienced more seizures and greater lethargy, in keeping with survey data from the Netherlands.64 We previously reported the death of a young patient with Dravet syndrome who had been seizure‐free, but had been walking outside on the hottest day in Melbourne (Australia) for years, with a peak of 46.5°C.65 There are other temperature‐sensitive epilepsies, though generally less well studied. An epilepsy‐related mutation in SCN8A was associated with temperature‐sensitive protein expression and function.66 Other genetic epilepsies with fever‐induced seizures include those due to certain mutations in the genes GABRG2 , CHD2, STX1B : Temperature elevation can affect brain thermal regulation and epileptiform discharges and induce seizures in models carrying certain mutations in GABRG2 67 or STX1B .68 Moreover, seizures in many epilepsies, of all types, are more frequent with psychological stress. Climate change is projected to increase population stress levels as it will affect mean climate, such as rainfall amounts and temperature, but also weather variability and extremes, probably of most consequence for human health. There has been little research into the effects of climate change on treatments for epilepsy. Lorazepam, used in many parts of the world as an emergency treatment for seizures, is especially prone to degradation with higher mean kinetic temperature.69 There are few data on other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and the summary of product characteristics for several commonly used AEDs do not include specific temperature recommendations, while, for example, phenobarbital tablets should be stored below 25°C.70 Medication supply chains can be compromised even today: It is easy to see how disruption to infrastructure could threaten AED (and indeed any drug) supply, as indeed happened after an exemplar (but not climate change‐related) disruption in a highly organized, well‐developed economy in the Great East Japan earthquake of 2011.71 In addition, biodiversity loss is a feature of climate change: This may compromise sources, such as plant, microbial, and fungal species, from which the next antiepileptic drugs might emerge (see Figure 3). Example of a zebrafish behavioral assay showing anticonvulsant activity of a plant extract typically used for ethnomedicinal purposes to treat seizures in Cameroon. Zebrafish larvae were pretreated with the ethanolic plant extract (25 µg/mL) for 18 h before acute exposure to pentylenetetrazol (20 mmol/L). Pentylenetetrazol‐induced convulsive‐like behavior was measured 5 min after, using an automated video‐tracking device. Graph shows total distance traveled by larvae in millimeters per 5‐min interval during a 30‐min tracking session. Data were analyzed using specialized software to quantify total larval movements and subjected to two‐way with repeated‐measures ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test (n = 10‐12/group). ***P <.001, *P <.05 (vs Veh + veh), ###P <.001, #P <.05 (vs Veh + PTZ). EXT, extract; PTZ, pentylenetetrazol; Veh, vehicle. Note: Total distance traveled by PTZ‐treated larvae is lower at later time intervals as larvae reach the equivalent of status epilepticus at this stage and are less able to move due to loss of posture—therefore accounting for lack of statistical significance between extract‐treated larvae Moreover, poverty is associated with reduced access to health care, with the majority of people in the world today with epilepsy having no access to any AEDs. Most climate change projections anticipate that poverty is likely to increase, with disproportionate effects for those already most vulnerable. Thus, we can anticipate that the negative influence of epilepsy on socioeconomic status and all‐cause risk of premature mortality will grow with climate change independent of any direct effect on epilepsy biology.

7 WHAT CAN THOSE INVOLVED IN EPILEPSY DO? Measures to address climate change may include attempts to reduce carbon emissions, and actions for mitigation and adaptation.1 For epilepsy professionals, there may be steps that be included in daily practice. Raising awareness of climate change, its impact for people with epilepsy and our contributions to climate change is a start—the very purpose of this article. Concurrently, more research is required to investigate into climate change and epilepsy, to better define the risks and develop adaptations and mitigations. Reduction of carbon emissions (“decarbonizing”) could begin with understanding the sources of carbon emissions at the individual level and monitoring of individual carbon contributions, for both professionals and people with epilepsy. Personal and SME carbon emissions calculators are available online (examples include: https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx; https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/; https://www.carbontrust.com/resources/tools/carbon-footprint-calculator/). Among the key contributors for most people as professionals will be travel, consumption of food and goods, IT equipment, hotels, and restaurants, but this is not an exhaustive list and we invite other suggestions. Travel is likely to be a major contributor for many professionals and patients. Flying to conferences and meetings is likely to be an important component of contributions to emissions at the personal professional level. Flying in classes other than economy increases emissions significantly, for several reasons (eg, see http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/blog-carbon-footprint-world-bank-group-staff-air-travel). Various websites, including some for academic travel in particular, can help people calculate, reduce, or mitigate emissions (eg, www.flyingless.org and https://thepointsguy.com/guide/a-guide-to-airline-carbonoffset-programs/). This is a difficult area, as clinical and scientific advances and stronger collaborations do emerge from face‐to‐face meetings, and teleconferencing still lacks both the personal touch and infallible reliability. But perhaps not every meeting is essential,65 and to achieve the carbon emission reductions necessary to stabilize the climate will require us to modify some current practices and find new ways to achieve the same outcomes. Targeted distribution of mitigation measures (eg, carbon offsetting) for conference attendance to those nations most at risk from climate change may suit some conference attendees. Higher levels of sustainability at conferences should be considered: hotel usage, maintenance of ambient temperatures in conference halls and hotels (and personal offices at work), and food and drink provision at meetings are all areas to be considered. Many organizations will consider these difficult changes to make for meetings that often represent sources of income, but as with many aspects of climate change, there is a bigger picture to consider. Climate scientists themselves have considered and addressed the issue of conference travel (https://noflyclimatesci.org/), even with a model for a “nearly carbon‐neutral conference.”74 More flying does not necessarily equate with greater academic success.75 Car journeys represent another area in which professionals and patients might both contribute, and actions such as telehealth initiatives may be possible in some settings and jurisdictions, though information technology infrastructure, privacy, and regulatory issues may present difficulties. Professionals can form powerful lobby groups and bring these issues to the attention of their organizations. We must not be nihilistic. Actions at governmental, institutional, and personal levels are required and possible. For example, the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change (http://www.ukhealthalliance.org/) advocates “for responses to climate change that protect and promote public health.” Online tools are available for further ideas and implementation of adaptation measures (eg, https://www.ukcip.org.uk/). Adaptations will be necessary and will need to be shaped by outcomes from research (ideally shared across diseases), such as improved awareness and management of changes in vector ranges or medicine manufacture and distribution practice. Nondomestic contributions to climate change exceed those of the residential sector. Companies and institutions around the world are beginning to take action: The behavior of employees, including epilepsy professionals, may be overlooked in this process, but can be central to the initiation, promotion, and success of programs designed to address climate change. Asking employees to switch their computers off at the end of the day, for example, does not mean people will do that. Professionals can, however, choose to take the lead. Evidence shows that people can be motivated as much by “cobenefits” (such as economic and scientific advancement; or fostering a more moral and caring community) as they are by concern about climate change, whether they are convinced about the occurrence of climate change or not.76 Adaptations might include, for example, increased vigilance and preemptive changes in behavior against local extreme heat events for people with epilepsy due to heat‐sensitive mutation‐driven genetic epilepsies, informed by local (downscaled) modeling of future climate trends, or improved short‐term weather forecasting. As precision medicine initiatives become more popular, one could envisage inclusion of climate change parameters in individualized epilepsy management schemes. We summarize some suggestions for actions in Table 2. Actions to consider regarding epilepsy and climate change Increase information available on impact on climate change on epilepsy and vice versa Collect data from people with epilepsy, own clinical practice Establish contact with local and national patient and carer support organizations; gather data systematically Establish links with local climate scientists, consider local and regional factors (eg, urban vs rural) Changing patterns of seizures and comorbidities reported by people with epilepsy; use of social media and big data methods Included temperature and humidity parameters in experimental models; quantification of stress and consequences in clinical trials; stability of medications Join local, national, international initiatives for individuals and professionals; calculate own carbon emissions at personal and professional levels Develop practice approaches that are more sustainable Consider changes with cobenefits to raise chances of engagement and success Consider travel options; use freely available tools; explore and engage with local health service sustainability efforts; lobby institutions, healthcare organizations, journals and conference organizers Consider measures that facilitate sustainable behavior—for example, earlier setting up of conferences to enable planning of more sustainable travel options Provide information and advice—for example, when heatwaves are expected; promote telehealth where possible Switch off devices when not needed; promote sustainable practices—for example, enable colleagues to attend meetings remotely, record talks for dissemination Promote sustainability for the next generation Facilitate remote supervision and mentoring; reduce dependence of academic progress upon less sustainable practices

Clinicians have always considered prevention to be better than cure. Minimizing the progress of climate change and mitigating emissions now will be cheaper than taking actions later when the situation has already gotten worse, although there is already a need for some adaptation due to warming from historical emissions. The challenge is huge, but it is incumbent upon us to do what we can: This is intrinsic to our commitment and duty to patient care and can be seen as part of the aim of achieving global equality of health care in epilepsy. People have managed huge challenges before—the reduction in drink driving rates, the reduced production of aerosols, and changes in behavior after the HIV epidemic. With climate change, the challenge is bigger, more global, and more urgent, but everything counts. Schools, towns, local councils, and nations have declared states of “climate emergency” (eg, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48126677), with a prominent role played by schoolchildren. Should and can a profession take action beyond virtue signaling? And if so, what additional evidence do we need to do that? Or in fact can we not afford to wait? We acknowledge the links between epilepsy and climate change we discuss are speculative, and more research is required. And, of course, anything we can do in our personal lives anyway can contribute to help counter one of the biggest challenges facing humanity and all life on this planet. We should perhaps finish with the words of the next generation, specifically Greta Thunberg (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg), aged 16, speaking to members of the European Parliament and European Union officials in Strasbourg on April 16, 2019, after the disastrous fire at Notre Dame cathedral: “It is still not too late to act. It will take a far‐reaching vision, it will take courage, it will take fierce, fierce determination to act now, to lay the foundations where we may not know all the details about how to shape the ceiling. In other words, it will take cathedral thinking. I ask you to please wake up and make changes required possible.”",mainstream,M0be32,climate.change
1115,"(CNN) Humans have damaged around a quarter of ice-free land on Earth, United Nations scientists warned in a major report Thursday, stressing that further degradation must be stopped to prevent catastrophic global warming .

The warning comes almost a year after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in a landmark report that we only have until 2030 to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and prevent the planet from reaching the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

The second IPCC report highlights the vicious cycle of climate change and land degradation.

""We humans affect more than 70% of ice-free land, a quarter of this land is degraded. The way we produce food and what we eat contributes to the loss of natural ecosystems and declining biodiversity,"" said Valérie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the IPCC.

Deforestation and agriculture also fuel global warming, by weakening land's capacity to draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases.

""When land is degraded, it reduces the soils ability to take up carbon and this exacerbates climate change. In turn, climate change exacerbates land degradation in many different ways. Today 500 million people live in areas that experience desertification,"" Masson-Delmotte said.

But the report does offer hope, there are major opportunities to reverse the damage, the IPCC notes.

Here are five key takeaways from the IPCC report:

Land the size of South America has been degraded

Human use takes up over 70% of the world's ice-free land surface, according to the IPCC report.

They degrade the planet's natural resources, with chemical fertilizers, deforestation and intensive farming. In the process, humans have damaged two billion hectares of land, the size of South America.

As a result, this land is less fertile and captures smaller quantities of carbon emissions from the atmosphere, according to Stephen Cornelius, the World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) chief advisor on climate change.

""The way we use land is driving the climate crisis,"" he told CNN. ""Ecosystem conversion releases greenhouse gas emissions.

Land use, including agriculture and deforestation, produces almost a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.

We need to stop wasting food and eat less meat

The IPCC report stresses that food waste and meat consumption will need to be reduced if we want to slash global emissions.

Both are big contributors to global warming -- with food waste producing between 8-10% and livestock 14.5% of global emissions, according to WWF.

According to the report, 25-30% of all food produced is never eaten, while 821 million worldwide are undernourished.

If food waste was a country, it would be the third largest emitter after the US and China, according to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), a non-profit working to reduce global waste.

""The fact that more than one billion tonnes of food never gets consumed while one in nine people go to bed hungry is a travesty,"" said Claire Kneller, head of food at WRAP.

If the United Nations goal of halving food waste by 2030 is to be met, countries should start measuring waste and adopt their own reduction goal, according to Kneller.

""We will not tackle the impact of climate change if we do not fix our global food system,"" she said.

We need to restore natural carbon sinks

Forests and wetlands are important carbon sinks, but have been greatly diminished by human activities, the IPCC warns, and their ability to capture carbon could continue to decrease depending on human actions.

Between 2007-2016, land removed 29% of total CO2 emissions from the atmosphere.

Peatlands -- a type of wetlands -- can hold carbon for centuries, but more intense droughts, floods and wildfires could trigger the release of carbon from the soil.

Sustainable soil management and agroforestry are key solutions that ""deliver carbon sequestration in soil or vegetation,"" the report notes.

Land restoration ""represents a fantastic opportunity to draw down carbon from the atmosphere,"" Cornelius said.

""The food system is both a leading cause and a casualty of climate change,"" according to Joao Campari, who leads WWF's global food practice.

Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, which destroy crops and critical farming infrastructure.

It's not just extreme weather that is threatening farming -- climate change is also changing what types of crops can grow in certain locations by making it too hot or too dry.

Campari told CNN the food system must ""urgently"" be reformed to avoid catastrophic global warming.

Food production uses 34% of land worldwide and contributes up to 75% of deforestation, he said.

To stave off the worst effects of climate change, humans need to stop converting land and destroying the soil with fertilizers and by cutting down trees, said Campari, adding that we already have enough farmland to feed the global population.

Bioenergy is not the answer

In its report last year, the IPCC warned that keeping global temperatures at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, using techniques such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).

But in its latest report, the IPCC said that quickly rolling out this technology on a large scale ""could greatly increase demand for land conversion.""

Ramping up bioenergy production through the use of fertilizers and irrigation could erode soil, increase water scarcity and threaten food security, the report notes.

Claudia Ringler, deputy director at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), told CNN that biofuels are not a scalable solution.

The world would have to convert 7.2 million square kilometers, 45% of the Earth's cropland, into bioenergy crops to keep global temperatures at 1.5°C, according to the most energy-intensive scenario outlined in the 2018 IPCC report.

""It's not possible, not at the rate they are proposing,"" Ringler said, explaining that the conversion of this much land would lead to a huge spike in global food prices and drive insecurity.",mainstream,M0f4a1,climate.change; global.warming
365,"Billie Eilish has opened up about her climate change fears in a revealing new interview.

Speaking to the LA Times, Eilish also spoke candidly about her frustrations at how people are not doing enough to stop climate change.

Eilish said: “It’s weird…It feels like we’re living in a movie that you’d watch where the world is like ending. We could stop it, but we’re not going to because everybody’s too lazy …We’re about to die if we don’t change.”

She continued: “I’ve had a million dreams about the world ending…It makes you realise how nothing we all are, and how little everyone’s lives matter because the world itself, if the world dies, we’re all gone. I want to have children and I want them to have children. That’s possibly not going to happen, and I hate it.”

At the American Music Awards last month, Eilish also showed her support for the environmental movement ‘Music Declares Emergency.’

1099,"Climate activists and world leaders have gathered this week in New York for the United Nations Climate Summit. But on Wednesday attention was focused across the Atlantic, where in Monaco the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change presented a special report on the “unprecedented” impact warming temperature will have on the world’s oceans. It’s not good. The report — compiled by over 100 authors from 36 countries citing close to 7,000 accredited sources — paints a grim picture of the effect warming oceans and the cryosphere will have on humanity, especially if nothing is done to curb emissions.

The ocean has played a critical role in warding off the effects of climate change by absorbing close to 25 percent of CO2 emissions. The report warns that as the temperature continues to rise and the ocean traps more heat, it will become more acidic, less oxygenated, less productive, less hospitable to life, and more likely to give rise to tropical storms and hurricanes, which will occur with greater frequency and intensity. The report notes that with any additional degree of warming, intense sea events that used to occur once per century will in certain regions once per year by the middle of the 21st century.

Connected to the fate of the world’s oceans is the fate of the world’s frozen areas, or the cryosphere, on which close to 1.5 billion people’s lives directs depend. As parts of the cryosphere melt (glaciers, for instance), the global sea level will continue to rise, dramatically altering life for those living in coast regions, if not making those regions uninhabitable. The sea level is rising twice as fast as it did during the 20th century, and that the rate is increasing, the report notes, explaining that the Antarctic ice sheet will contribute more to sea level rise by 2100 than was previously expected. In the next 80 years, the sea level could increased by up to 60 centimeters if greenhouse gas emissions are dramatically reduced, and 110 centimeters if they are not.

It isn’t just glaciers and rising sea levels, either. As permafrost, snow, and ice melt, the frequency of landslides, avalanches, rockfalls, floods, and wildfires will increase. Water availability could also be thrown into flux as glaciers retreat, impacting agriculture.

“The world’s ocean and cryosphere have been ‘taking the heat’ from climate change for decades, and consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe,” IPCC Vice Chair Ko Barett said in a statement. “The rapid changes to the ocean and the frozen parts of our planet are forcing people from coastal cities to remote Arctic communities to fundamentally alter their ways of life.”

In August, the IPCC released a similarly dire report about the impact the climate crisis will have on the global food supply. This extends well beyond traditional agriculture. The report released Wednesday explains that the “global catch potential” for fish could decrease as the warming ocean becomes less hospitable to marine life, and that communities that rely on seafood could be in trouble. The only answer is to cut CO2 emissions and work toward more sustainable solutions. “Cutting greenhouse gas emissions will limit impacts on ocean ecosystems that provide us with food, support our health and shape our cultures,” IPCC Co-Chair Hans-Otto Pörtner, Co-Chair said in a statement. “Reducing other pressures such as pollution will further help marine life deal with changes in their environment, while enabling a more resilient ocean.”

Despite the realities detailed in the report, it was structured around the idea that many of these consequences can be mitigated with “timely, ambitious and coordinated action” to reduce emissions and pursue sustainable development. Unfortunately for humanity, China and the United States, the world’s two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, have largely ignored he climate crisis. Neither cared to contribute possible solutions at the UN’s Climate Summit this week.",mainstream,M08803,climate.change
1068,"Nearly 50 years ago, three chemists named Mario Molina, Sherwood Rowland and Paul Crutzen found evidence that chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals known as CFCs and released from aerosol sprays, were weakening the ozone layer that functions as the earth’s natural sunscreen protecting humans, animals and plants from harmful radiation.

The discovery made big news and rattled the public. Aerosol sales dropped dramatically, and, despite pushback from the chemical companies that made CFCs, Congress in 1977 added protecting the ozone layer to the Environmental Protection Agency’s duties under the Clean Air Act. Not long afterward, the agency determined that the compounds, then widely used in refrigerators, air-conditioners and some industrial processes, posed an even graver threat to the atmosphere than first thought. Soon after, pressure began to build for a phaseout of CFCs in the United States as well as for an international treaty to find alternatives.

The case for global action became ever more urgent in 1985 when a British team discovered a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica, followed by confirmation by NASA scientists of a connection between the hole and CFCs. With the rest of the world and even industry on board, the result was the 1987 Montreal Protocol, a landmark agreement banning chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting chemicals. End of story? Not quite. As it happened, the ozone-friendly replacements for the CFCs, known as hydrofluorocarbons, turned out to be distinctly unfriendly to the climate. So in 2016, the Montreal signatories reconvened in Kigali, Rwanda, and agreed to amend the original protocol to phase out HFCs and find substitutes more friendly to the atmosphere.

The bottom line is that the world, confronted with two dire threats to the earth’s fragile atmosphere, found two planetary responses with positive outcomes. The ozone layer is healing. That’s worth remembering as we struggle, often despairingly, to find common ground in the battle against climate change. Compared with the manifold complexities of global warming, dealing with ozone depletion was, in fact, relatively simple. But the key point is that it happened, and it’s worth asking why the world has not responded with similar resolve in dealing with the main global warming gases like carbon dioxide, about which we have known a lot for a long time.",mainstream,M0bb71,climate.change; global.warming
894,"The United Nations may resort to military action against states that defy its mandates on global climate action, according to Ole Wæver, a prominent international relations professor at the University of Copenhagen.

In an interview with ABC News in Australia, Professor Wæver cautions that what he sees as “climate inaction” might draw the U.N. into considering other means to ensure its goals are met, even if that leads to global armed conflict.

Professor Wæver says more resistance to change could potentially threaten democracy although the U.N. would counter that the end justified the means in much the same way countries like Greece had their debt crisis solutions forced on them by European Union bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg.

“The United Nations Security Council could, in principle, tomorrow decide that climate change is a threat to international peace and security,” he says.

“And then it’s within their competencies to decide ‘and you are doing this, you are doing this, you are doing this, this is how we deal with it’.”

He believes classifying climate change as a security issue could leave the door open to more extreme policy responses.

“That’s what happens when something becomes a security issue, it gets the urgency, the intensity, the priority, which is helpful sometimes, but it also lets the dark forces loose in the sense that it can justify problematic means,” he says.

This urgency, he says, could lead to more abrupt – and essentially undemocratic – action at an international level.

“If there was something that was decided internationally by some more centralised procedure and every country was told ‘this is your emission target, it’s not negotiable, we can actually take military measures if you don’t fulfill it’, then you would basically have to get that down the throat of your population, whether they like it or not,” he says.

“A bit like what we saw in southern Europe with countries like Greece and the debt crisis and so on. There were decisions that were made for them and then they just had to have a more or less technocratic government and get it through.”

Professor Wæver made his predictions last month on the eve of the United Nations COP25 climate conference now underway in Madrid, Spain.

Almost 25,000 delegates and 1500 journalists have flown into the Spanish capital to attend the two-week long meeting.

COP25 will consider a wide agenda of global action including implementing taxes on developed countries to transfer wealth to nations dealing with “the cost of drought, floods and superstorms made worse by rising temperatures,” as Breitbart News reported.

President Donald Trump officially withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, which COP25 is a continuation thereof, in October as part of an election promise to voters, saying he was “elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.”",conspiracy,C003c3,climate.change
430,"The scientific consensus on climate change, to the tune of 97 per cent of experts, is that humans are changing Earth’s climate for the worse. But some people continue to insist that some of these scientists are wrong, incurring anger among those trying to teach people about the dangers of climate change.

And one professor from Texas has had enough – he’s decided to offer £17,500 ($30,000) to anyone that can prove to him that climate change is not man-made.

Dr Christopher Keating, who previously taught at the University of South Dakota, says the climate change deniers of today are engaged in a campaign that is similar to the one waged by tobacco advocates to deny a link between smoking and lung cancer.

Previously he had been offering £5,850 ($10,000) to the first person to prove climate changing wasn’t man-made but he has since upped the reward to £17,500 ($30,000).

All someone needs to do is show him evidence that unequivocally proves he is wrong on his blog. The challenge is open to anyone over 18 and there is no entry fee.

‘I will judge all entries and show why they fail or succeed in the challenge,’ Dr Keating, also the author of Undeniable: Dialogues on Global Warming, said. ‘Entries don’t even have to be original. They just have to be first.’

He has been involved, at some level, with climate change for 30 years, having been a professor of physics for over 20 years and teaching at the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.",conspiracy,C02d08,climate.change; global.warming
513,"Climate change is the long-term alteration in Earth’s climate and weather patterns. It took nearly a century of research and data to convince the vast majority of the scientific community that human activity could alter the climate of our entire planet. In the 1800s, experiments suggesting that human-produced carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gases could collect in the atmosphere and insulate Earth were met with more curiosity than concern. By the late 1950s, CO2 readings would offer some of the first data to corroborate the global warming theory. Eventually an abundance of data, along with climate modeling would show not only that global warming was real, but that it also presented a host of dire consequences.

Dating back to the ancient Greeks, many people had proposed that humans could change temperatures and influence rainfall by chopping down trees, plowing fields or irrigating a desert.

One theory of climate effects, widely believed until the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, held that “rain follows the plow,” the now-discredited idea that tilling soil and other agricultural practices would result in increased rainfall.

Accurate or not, those perceived climate effects were merely local. The idea that humans could somehow alter climate on a global scale would seem far-fetched for centuries.

In the 1820s, French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier proposed that energy reaching the planet as sunlight must be balanced by energy returning to space since heated surfaces emit radiation. But some of that energy, he reasoned, must be held within the atmosphere and not return to space, keeping Earth warm.

He proposed that Earth’s thin covering of air—its atmosphere—acts the way a glass greenhouse would. Energy enters through the glass walls, but is then trapped inside, much like a warm greenhouse.

Experts have since pointed out that the greenhouse analogy was an oversimplification, since outgoing infrared radiation isn’t exactly trapped by Earth’s atmosphere but absorbed. The more greenhouse gases there are, the more energy is kept within Earth’s atmosphere.

But the so-called greenhouse effect analogy stuck and some 40 years later, Irish scientist John Tyndall would start to explore exactly what kinds of gases were most likely to play a role in absorbing sunlight.

Tyndall’s laboratory tests in the 1860s showed that coal gas (containing CO2, methane and volatile hydrocarbons) was especially effective at absorbing energy. He eventually demonstrated that CO2 alone acted like sponge in the way it could absorb multiple wavelengths of sunlight.

By 1895, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius became curious about how decreasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere might cool Earth. In order to explain past ice ages, he wondered if a decrease in volcanic activity might lower global CO2 levels. His calculations showed that if CO2 levels were halved, global temperatures could decrease by about 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit).

Next, Arrhenius wondered if the reverse were true. Arrhenius returned to his calculations, this time investigating what would happen if CO2 levels were doubled. The possibility seemed remote at the time, but his results suggested that global temperatures would increase by the same amount—5 degrees C or 9 degrees F.

Decades later, modern climate modeling have confirmed that Arrhenius’ numbers weren’t far off the mark.

Back in the 1890s, however, the concept of warming the planet was remote and even welcomed.

As Arrehenius wrote, “By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid [CO2] in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates, especially as regards the colder regions of the earth.”

By the 1930s, at least one scientist would start to claim that carbon emissions might already be having a warming effect. British engineer Guy Stewart Callendar noted that the United States and North Atlantic region had warmed significantly on the heels of the Industrial Revolution.

Callendar’s calculations suggested that a doubling of CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere could warm Earth by 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F). He would continue to argue into the 1960s that a greenhouse-effect warming of the planet was underway.

While Callendar’s claims were largely met with skepticism, he managed to draw attention to the possibility of global warming. That attention played a part in garnering some of the first government-funded projects to more closely monitor climate and CO2 levels.

Most famous among those research projects was a monitoring station established in 1958 by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography on top of Hawaii’s Mauna Loa Observatory.

Scripps geochemist Charles Keeling was instrumental in outlining a way to record CO2 levels and in securing funding for the observatory, which was positioned in the center of the Pacific Ocean.

Data from the observatory revealed what would become known as the “Keeling Curve.” The upward, saw tooth-shaped curve showed a steady rise in CO2 levels, along with short, jagged up-and-down levels of the gas produced by repeated wintering and greening of the Northern Hemisphere.

The dawn of advanced computer modeling in the 1960s began to predict possible outcomes of the rise in CO2 levels made evident by the Keeling Curve. Computer models consistently showed that a doubling of CO2 could produce a warming of 2 degrees C or 3.6 degrees F within the next century.

Still, the models were preliminary and a century seemed a very long time away.

In the early 1970s, a different kind of climate worry took hold: global cooling. As more people became concerned about pollutants people were emitting into the atmosphere, some scientists theorized the pollution could block sunlight and cool Earth.

In fact, Earth did cool somewhat between 1940-1970 due to a postwar boom in aerosol pollutants which reflected sunlight away from the planet. The idea that sunlight-blocking pollutants could chill Earth caught on in the media, as in a 1974 Time magazine article titled “Another Ice Age?”

But as the brief cooling period ended and temperatures resumed their upward climb, warnings by a minority of scientists that Earth was cooling were dropped. Part of the reasoning was that while smog could remain suspended in the air for weeks, CO2 could persist in the atmosphere for centuries.

The early 1980s would mark a sharp increase in global temperatures. Many experts point to 1988 as a critical turning point when watershed events placed global warming in the spotlight.

The summer of 1988 was the hottest on record (although many since then have been hotter). 1988 also saw widespread drought and wildfires within the United States.

Scientists sounding the alarm about climate change began to see media and the public paying closer attention. NASA scientist James Hansen delivered testimony and presented models to congress in June of 1988, saying he was “99 percent sure” that global warming was upon us.

One year later, in 1989, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established under the United Nations to provide a scientific view of climate change and its political and economic impacts.

As global warming gained currency as a real phenomenon, researchers dug into possible ramifications of a warming climate. Among the predictions were warnings of severe heat waves, droughts and more powerful hurricanes fueled by rising sea surface temperatures.

Other studies predicted that as massive glaciers at the poles melt, sea levels could rise between 11 and 38 inches (28 to 98 centimeters) by 2100, enough to swamp many of the cities along the east coast of the United States.

Kyoto Protocol: United States In, Then Out

Government leaders began discussions to try and stem the outflow of greenhouse gas emissions to prevent the most dire predicted outcomes. The first global agreement to reduce greenhouse gases, the Kyoto Protocol, was adopted in 1997.

The protocol, which was signed by President Bill Clinton, called for reducing the emission of six greenhouse gases in 41 countries plus the European Union to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels during the target period of 2008 to 2012.

In March 2001, shortly after taking office, President George W. Bush announced the United States would not implement the Kyoto Protocol, saying the protocol was “fatally flawed in fundamental ways” and citing concerns that the deal would hurt the U.S. economy.

That same year, the IPCC issued its third report on climate change, saying that global warming, unprecedented since the end of the last ice age, is “very likely,” with highly damaging future impacts. Five years later, in 2006, former Vice President and presidential candidate Al Gore weighed in on the dangers of global warming with the debut of his film An Inconvenient Truth. Gore won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of climate change.

Politicization over climate change, however, would continue, with some skeptics arguing that predictions presented by the IPCC and publicized in media like Gore’s film were overblown.

Among those expressing skepticism over global warming was future U.S. president Donald Trump. On November 6, 2012, Trump tweeted “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”

Paris Climate Agreement: United States In, Then Out

The United States, under President Barack Obama, would sign onto another milestone treaty on climate change, the Paris Climate Agreement, in 2015. In that agreement, 195 countries pledged to set targets for their own greenhouse gas cuts and to report their progress.

The backbone of the Paris Climate Agreement was a declaration to prevent a global temperature rise of 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F). Many experts considered 2 degrees C of warming to be a critical limit, which, if surpassed will lead to increasing risk of more deadly heat waves, droughts, storms and rising global sea levels.

The election of Donald Trump in 2016 led to the United States declaring it would withdraw from the Paris treaty. President Trump, citing the “onerous restrictions” imposed by the accord, stated that he could not “in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States.”

That same year, independent analyses by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found Earth’s 2016 surface temperatures to be the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880. And in October 2018, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report that concluded ""rapid, far-reaching"" actions are needed to cap global warming at 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) and avert the most dire, irreversible consequences for the planet.

In August 2018, Swedish teenager and climate activist Greta Thunberg began protesting in front of Swedish Parliament with a sign: “School Strike for Climate.” Her protest to raise awareness for global warming caught the world by storm and by November 2018, over 17,000 students in 24 countries were participating in climate strikes. By March 2019, Thunberg was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. She participated in the United Nations Climate Summit in New York City in August of 2019, famously taking a boat across the Atlantic instead of flying to reduce her carbon footprint.

The UN Climate Action Summit reinforced d that “1.5℃ is the socially, economically, politically and scientifically safe limit to global warming by the end of this century,” and set a deadline for achieving net zero emissions to 2050.

678,"Fresh off a climate strike that took hundreds of thousands of young people out of classrooms and into the streets globally, youth leaders have gathered at the United Nations to demand radical moves to fight climate change.

“We showed that we are united and that we, young people, are unstoppable,” said 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who started the climate strike movement with her lone protest in front of her country’s parliament about a year and a half ago.

More than 700 mostly young activists attended the first Youth Climate Summit, according to Luis Alfonso de Alba, the U.N. special climate summit envoy.

Friday’s strike across six continents and Saturday’s youth conference presage a full-on climate conference next week at the U.N. General Assembly, which has placed the issue of climate change at front and center as world leaders gather for the annual meeting.

Activists at Saturday’s gathering demanded money for a fund to help poorer nations adapt to a warming world and provide greener energy. They also insisted that the world should wean itself quickly from coal, oil and gas, linked to climate change.

“Stop the criminal contaminant behavior of big corporations,” said Argentine climate activist Bruno Rodriguez. “Enough is enough. We don’t want fossil fuels anymore.”

Jayathma Wickramanayake, the U.N. secretary-general’s youth envoy, called climate change “the defining issue of our time. Millions of young people all over the world are already being affected by it.”

During Thunberg’s short lifetime, for example, Earth has already warmed 0.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.34 degrees Celsius).

Fiji climate activist Komal Karishma Kumar said global warming is not just taking a toll on the planet but on her generation, especially people from vulnerable places like her Pacific island nation.

“Young people from different parts of the world are living in constant fear and climate anxiety, fearing the future, the uncertainty of a healthy life or a life for their children at all,” Kumar said.

She added: “I do not want our future generations to submerge with our sinking islands.”

After listening to Thunberg and other youth climate activists, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres credited young people with transforming him from a pessimist to an optimist in the fight against global warming.

Guterres said he sees “a change in momentum” going into Monday’s Climate Action Summit taking place ahead of the U.N. General Assembly gathering that starts Tuesday, telling the youths “you have started this movement.”

“I encourage you to keep your initiative. Keep your mobilization and more and more to hold my generation accountable,” Guterres said. “My generation has largely failed until now to preserve both justice in the world and to preserve the planet.”

Kumar told Guterres that “we will hold you accountable and if you do not, remember we will mobilize to vote you out.”

The youth activists brainstormed about what they could do to change the trajectory of an ever-warming planet and how they can help the world adapt. There was talk of hashtags, entrepreneurial ideas and climate art and poetry.

“Dear friends, time is running out!” the pope told a group of participants in a Vatican-sponsored conference on energy transition Friday. “We cannot afford the luxury of waiting for others to come forward or of prioritizing short-term economic benefits. The climate crisis requires decisive action from us, here and now.”

Despite the pontiff’s frequent denunciation of a “politics of fear,” he seemed determined to paint as frightening a picture as possible of an impending climate apocalypse in order to incite people to action.

This conference “takes place at a critical moment,” Francis said. “Today’s ecological crisis, especially climate change, threatens the very future of the human family, and this is not an exaggeration. For too long we have collectively ignored the fruits of scientific analysis, and catastrophic predictions can no longer be viewed with contempt and irony.”

The pope’s words Friday went beyond sounding a general alarm and scorning climate-change skeptics. They also urged specific political action, most notably regarding penalties for carbon usage such as a carbon tax.

“A carbon pricing policy is essential if humanity wants to use the resources of creation wisely,” he said. “The failure to manage carbon emissions has produced a huge debt that will now have to be repaid with interest from those who come after us.”

The year 2019 saw the unfolding of a number of dramatic events.

At the beginning of the year, the Venezuelan opposition orchestrated a coup, with dozens of countries including a number of South American countries recognizing opposition figure Juan Guaidó as president. This attempt appears to have failed miserably as the military and the bulk of the Venezuelan population appear to oppose an undemocratic regime change.

In April, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange was forcefully removed from the Ecuadorean Embassy in the United Kingdom where he had sought sanctuary from a wrongful and unjust prosecution at the hands of the U.S.

In June, U.S.- Iran tensions would escalate with attacks on oil tankers in Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz culminating in the drone killing in early January of high ranking Iranian military figure Qasem Soleimani.

Popular uprisings around the globe were unquestionably a feature of the year. The Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests) movement endured throughout the entirety of the year with weekly demonstrations against the Macron government’s neoliberal reforms. Likewise, the uprisings in Hong Kong grabbed much of the media spotlight, And later in the year, the world would see popular eruptions in Ecuador, Chile, and other Latin American centres, in Haiti, in Sudan and in Lebanon.

On the climate change front, while Greta Thunberg and the youth climate activists took centre stage in unprecedented numbers, infernos light up the Amazon, California and Australia, scientists highlight the threat to global food supply from climate change, the world’s oceans are being depleted of oxygen, the melting of glacial and polar ice accelerates, and the UN’s World Meteorological Organization reports that the concentration of climate-heating greenhouse gases has hit another all-time high with “no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline.”

270,"hinstrap penguins are exquisitely adapted to their environment. They live and breed in some of the world’s harshest conditions, nesting in the windblown, rocky coves of the Antarctic Peninsula, a strip of land comprising the northernmost part of the frigid continent. In water they are precision hunters, darting after krill, the tiny shrimp-like crustaceans that are their sole food source, utilizing barbed tongues engineered for catching the slipperiest of prey. On land, these 2-2.5-foot-tall flightless birds are prodigious mountaineers, able to scale rocky escarpments in spite of their ungainly waddle. Their perfect adaptation to local conditions makes them the ideal barometer for the future of the region. If anything changes in the marine environment, the health of chinstrap penguins will be one of the most reliable indicators. They are the canaries of the Southern Ocean.

And these endearing, black and white emissaries from Antarctic waters are starting to disappear.

Scientists conducting a chinstrap census along the Antarctic Peninsula have discovered drastic declines in many colonies, with some seeing population reductions of up to 77% since they were last surveyed, about 50 years ago. The independent researchers, who hitched a ride on a Greenpeace expedition to the region, found that every single one of the 32 colonies surveyed on Elephant Island, a major chinstrap outpost, had declined. Overall, the island’s total chinstrap population had dropped by more than half, from 122,550 breeding pairs in 1971 to 52,786 in January 2020. “Such significant declines suggest that the Southern Ocean’s ecosystem is fundamentally changed from 50 years ago, and that the impacts of this are rippling up the food web to species like chinstrap penguins,” says Heather J. Lynch, associate professor of ecology & evolution at Stony Brook University in upstate New York, who designed the study.

“There is something broken in the Southern Ocean,” adds ornithologist Noah Strycker, a member of the penguin census team, and the author of the 2015 book . “Our best guess on why that could be is climate change, which we know is hitting the Antarctic Peninsula region harder than…practically anywhere else in the world except the Arctic.” Warming waters reduce the sea ice and the phytoplankton that krill depend upon for feeding and survival. Ocean acidification, a side effect of increasing global carbon emissions, also impacts their ability to reproduce.

For the past five weeks Stony Brook scientists have joined forces with robotics and drone specialists from Boston’s Northeastern University to survey relatively unstudied chinstrap penguin colonies along the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Chinstraps prefer rocky, windblown sites for nesting, because they provide the best conditions for keeping eggs safe and dry. Those conditions make research difficult: the scientists endured freezing temperatures, wind, rain and snow to reach the coastal rookeries by small inflatable motorboats, then scrambled among the colonies counting penguins by hand. The robotics team backed up the survey with drone footage. When they return to the lab, members of that team will use the findings to teach computers how to identify nests using artificial intelligence for help in future surveys.

The researchers surveyed 56 colonies in 37 days. So far, they’ve only released numbers from the Elephant Island sites, which were the first to be surveyed. The final report will be published in a few weeks. But those initial findings appear to be consistent across most colonies. “From whatever limited data we have from the 1980s, chinstrap populations appear to be down by over half,” says biologist Steve Forrest, the team lead on the expedition.

On Jan. 31, 2020, 26 days into the expedition, Forrest motored around the President’s Head promontory on Snow Island to scout for potential survey sites. Some 30 years ago, researchers documented a colony there, but Forrest had heard rumors from passing boats that it had disappeared. The sea was too rough for a census that day, but it didn’t matter. Peering through a pair of binoculars, Forrest saw no evidence that there were any penguins left on the island at all. “I was hoping that we might find the colony after all,” he says. “But not finding one is more along the lines of what we expected.” Some of the older surveys in the more difficult-to-reach areas are unreliable — conducted at a distance, by boat — so an exact assessment of how much has changed in the last three decades is impossible. Still, Forrest says, he is confident that chinstrap populations are declining, particularly in the South Shetland Islands (including Elephant Island) off the coast of the Peninsula. “I saw a lot of abandoned nesting places, so I am inclined to believe that it is a real decline, but the precise extent is uncertain.”

While the numbers of chinstraps may be on the wane, the researchers saw a marked increase in gentoo penguin populations. Gentoos, which have red-orange beaks and lack the distinctive black band around the throat that gives chinstraps their names, are much more flexible about what they eat and the conditions under which they breed. This means that they can more easily adapt to changes in their environment. Forrest calls them “climate change winners” for their ability to thrive in conditions that threaten chinstraps— at least in the short term. Strycker calls the process by which the upstarts take over chinstrap areas “gentoofication.”

Strycker, a committed birder who chronicled his attempt to spot more than half the planet’s bird species in a single year in a 2017 book called Birding Without Borders: An Obsession, a Quest, and the Biggest Year in the World admits that ultimately, it’s not even about the penguins. It’s about krill. Krill are the foundation of the marine food system — the fish that eat them are the fodder for the fish on which almost every ocean predator relies. The fish that we humans eat also primarily rely on krill as a food source. If krill populations are unhealthy, it means trouble down the line for everyone else. But krill, in their krillions, are hard to study.

That’s where the chinstraps come in. Like certain whale species, chinstraps are krill specialists, but they are relatively easier to track compared to whales, with their erratic migration patterns. Chinstrap penguins reliably return to the same rookeries year after year to breed, so by assessing colony health over time, scientists can get a better idea of how the krill they depend on are doing. Which is “why we should care about a bunch of penguins going missing from a remote island that no one’s ever heard of,” says Strycker. “Penguins give us an idea about what is going on in the ocean around us. The ocean processes that are changing in the Antarctic are similar to the processes that are changing everywhere else in the world.” Humans may not have evolved to catch krill the way chinstraps do, but our fate is tied to the tiny crustaceans all the same.",mainstream,M0ef86,climate.change

76,"(CNN) Cities from New York to Shanghai could see regular flooding , as sea levels rise faster than previously thought.

Glaciers and ice sheets from the Himalayas to Antarctica are rapidly melting

And the fisheries that feed millions of people are shrinking.

These are just some of the impacts that emissions of greenhouse gases have already triggered across the planet's oceans and frozen regions, according to a new landmark report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

""This report is unique because for the first time ever, the IPCC has produced an in-depth report examining the furthest corners of the Earth -- from the highest mountains in remote polar regions to the deepest oceans,"" said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC. ""We've found that even and especially in these places, human-caused climate change is evident.""

It is just the latest scientific evidence showing that human-induced warming is rapidly taking the planet down an uncharted path.

The scientists say there may be some impacts to the global climate -- like some amount of sea level rise -- that can no longer be stopped.

But even though there is uncertainty in the report about what exactly the future holds, the authors are unambiguous on this: Despite the damage that has been done, humanity still has a choice.

Taking swift action to end the global economy's dependence on fossil fuels can ward off some of the worst projected impacts, they say.

Or, we continue down the path we are on, into a world far less hospitable than the one we live in.

This new report paints a full and alarming picture of the rapid thawing happening in frozen regions all across the globe -- and how the changes will dramatically alter human civilization in the coming decades.

The findings show that the planet's warming is accelerating melting in glaciers and ice sheets from Greenland to Antarctica, and that sea levels will likely rise more than previously projected by the end of this century.

Because of the growing contributions from Antarctic melting, the authors say sea level rise is now likely to exceed three feet by 2100 if carbon emissions continue to increase.

Perhaps most concerning is what may be happening to the Antarctic ice sheet, which has the potential to raise sea levels much higher.

The scientists warn that more study is needed, but say changes observed in parts of Antarctica could be the first signs the ice sheet has reached a point of no return.

""If this is true, then there is a chance of a multi-meter sea level rise within the next two to three centuries,"" said Regine Hock, a professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and a coordinating lead author on chapter two of this IPCC report. ""That is very substantial.""

Even if collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet is not imminent, the report says that many of the 680 million people around the world living in low-lying coastal areas will experience annual flooding events by 2050 that used to occur only once a century.

But over the last 40 years, the report finds that Arctic sea ice is very likely shrinking during all months of the year, which is driving further warming. The decrease observed in September sea ice is particularly significant and likely unprecedented for at least 1000 years.

In nearly all regions, the scientists also found that snow cover is diminishing and glaciers are in retreat. Runoff from these sources provides drinking water to millions and is used to grow much of the food we eat.

And permafrost, soil that stays frozen throughout the year and contains gigatons of potentially planet-warming carbon and methane, has also undergone record warming.

Scientists say the oceans that cover 71 percent of Earth's surface have borne the brunt of the warming that humans have caused.

But the report warns they can no longer keep up.

It is ""virtually certain"" that the world's oceans have warmed nonstop since 1970 and have absorbed 90 percent of the planet's excess heat, the report says.

Marine heatwaves that have killed off vast stretches of Earth's coral reefs have very likely doubled in frequency and are projected to become more common and intense, the report finds.

As a result, shifts have occurred in the geographic ranges of many species and maximum fish catches have decreased, the scientists say. Some regions, like the Arctic, could see fish populations increase. But across the world's tropics, fish and other seafood are likely to become harder to find.

For the millions of people around the world that depend on the ocean as a primary food source, the findings are troubling.

""Taken together, these changes show that the world's ocean and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades,"" said Barrett. ""The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe.""

The report is clear that there are some future impacts to the oceans and ice that cannot be avoided.

Instead, many vulnerable cities and communities -- especially along the coasts and in the Arctic -- will be forced to adapt to the changes. Doing so will be difficult, especially for those in the poorest countries. And the scale and pace of the changes coming, the report warns, will challenge governments' abilities to develop and implement solutions.

But the science is equally clear that many of the projected impacts can be avoided through ambitious and rapid reductions in carbon emissions.

For instance, rates of sea level rise are projected to reach 15 millimeters per year by 2100 under a high emissions scenario. But under a lower emissions scenario -- where humans draw down global greenhouse gases very soon -- sea levels are expected to rise much slower at 4 millimeters per year.

""It drives home the message that policies that curb greenhouse gas emissions can have a strong effect on future sea level rise,"" said Andrea Dutton, an associate professor in the Department of Geoscience at the University of Wisconsin Madison. ""What we do today can decide which of those pathways we're on.""

The choices made now are critical to limit the future impacts, and avoid the escalating costs and risks that come with delayed action, the report says.",mainstream,M0bbc4,climate.change
771,"In the summer of 2015, Shelma Lamy and her infant daughter, Neslina, got on a plane in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, and flew to northwest Arkansas. Life in the islands had been difficult. While Lamy was growing up, her parents worked nonstop—her father was a carpenter but also drove a taxi; her mother was a cook in a restaurant—so she spent much of her time helping with chores around the house, cooking and cleaning, and watching the smaller children, including a brother who was half-paralyzed. In the eighth grade, she stopped going to school, like many other kids her age; as she got older, it was hard to find work. The unemployment rate in the Marshall Islands is nearly forty per cent, and most of the available jobs for someone with little education are men’s jobs, such as construction, Lamy said—“and they don’t always bring enough money to support the whole household.” Often, one household, as was Lamy’s case, includes three or four families living together.",mainstream,M0eae3,climate.change
570,"Protecting the Environment and Addressing Climate Change at Home: November 2008 to January 2017

From the day he first took office in January 2009 to the day he left office in January 2017, President Barack Obama believed that no challenge posed a greater threat to our children, our planet, and future generations than climate change. Indeed, as he saw it, acting on climate change was a moral obligation of the present, not a distant problem of the future. And that’s because, long before President Obama assumed office, the planet was already changing in ways that—if left unchecked—would have a profound impact on all of humankind. The scientific evidence accumulated and reviewed over the past several decades showed unequivocally that the planet was warming, primarily due to human activities over the past 50 years. As a result, summers were becoming longer and hotter. Winters were becoming shorter and warmer. Ice on land and in lakes and seas was melting. Global sea levels were rising. And from storms, hurricanes, and heavy downpours to droughts, fires, and floods, extreme weather was becoming more frequent and intense. Simply put, climate change was dramatically altering the world—and altering it in ways detrimental to life on Earth.

This timeline tells the story of how the President and his team took action to mitigate the impacts of climate change and protect our environment at home. It documents the decisions made, as well as the challenges faced, by the Administration in its efforts to protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land that supports and sustains us. Above all, the timeline shows that—from reducing carbon pollution and expanding the clean energy economy to increasing the resilience of communities to the impacts of climate change to restoring ecosystems and preserving iconic landscapes—the President worked diligently to bring together Federal agencies, and all stakeholders, to tackle the greatest environmental challenges and economic opportunities of our time.

107,"The world is 'way off track' in meeting targets set for slowing rising temperatures and tackling climate change as a new UN report finds the planet is already 2F warmer.

A damning report compiled by the UN's World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) highlights 2019's increasing heat, accelerating sea level rises, and extreme weather.

Last year was the second hottest year on record, with a global average temperature of almost 2 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, the WMO said.

The five years from 2015-2019 were the five warmest years on record and 2010-2019 was the hottest decade since records began in the 19th century.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said action was needed urgently, that there is no time to lose 'if we are to avert climate catastrophe.'

The report found that each decade since the 1980s has been hotter than any preceding decade stretching back to 1850 when records began.

The study had input from national meteorological services, international experts, scientific institutions and UN agencies.

The trends found so far continue in 2020, with the report published in the wake of the hottest January on record and some parts of the northern hemisphere, including Europe, experiencing an unusually warm winter.

Antarctica has reported new temperature highs, accompanied by large-scale ice melt and a fracturing glacier which will have 'repercussions for sea level rise'.

Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization said at a briefing on the agency's annual State of the Global Climate 2019 report that carbon dioxide has contributed two-thirds of global warming.

He said it has a 'lifetime is of several hundreds of years - so it's a problem that doesn't go away if you let these concentrations continue.'

This year countries are expected, under the international Paris Agreement on climate change, to increase their action to tackle greenhouse gas emissions to prevent the worst impacts of global warming.

In a foreword to the report, Guterres said: 'We are currently way off track to meeting the targets that the Paris Agreement calls for.

'This report outlines the latest science and illustrates the urgency for far-reaching climate action.'

Alongside temperature increases, rainfall changes had a major impact on several countries and sea levels were rising at an increasing pace, exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and submersion, he said.

Greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere continued to rise in 2019, and carbon emissions from global fossil fuels grew 0.6 per cent last year.

The report found record high temperatures from Australia to India, Japan, and Europe also impacted on people's health.

There were two major heatwaves in Europe, in June and July, with new national temperature records set in the UK, where the thermometer hit 38.7C.

There were also record temperatures in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France.

'We have also broken records in carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide,' three greenhouse gases that cause global warming,' said Taalas.

'Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue.'

He added it was a matter of time before the world had a new record hot year - with predictions it will come within five years.

There are also implications for disease - with dengue fever spreading to the point where half the world population is at risk of infection.

World hunger is on the rise again, and an estimated 22 million people worldwide were forced to leave their homes by events such as floods and storms.

Guterres, said: 'Greenhouse gas concentrations are at the highest levels in 3 million years - when the Earth's temperature was as much as three degrees hotter and sea levels some 15 meters higher.

'Ocean heat is at a record level, with temperatures rising at the equivalent of five Hiroshima bombs a second.'

Taalas said the warming of the oceans has led to unusual tropical storms, including one in Mozambique in March 2019 that was the strongest in the Southern Hemisphere 'at least for the past hundred years.'

He said there is also an estimate 'that sea water is the most acid in 25 million years ... and that's going to have negative impacts on the sea ecosystems.'

Taalas also pointed to forest fires causing a lot of emissions, in the Arctic and Australia where 'they were, again, record breaking.'

'Smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in Australia circumnavigated the globe, causing a spike in carbon dioxide emissions,' he said.

The contiguous US, excluding Alaska, Hawaii and other islands, experienced the highest 12-month rainfall on record from July 2018 to June 2019, and the country lost an estimated $20 billion (£15 billion) from flooding last year.

Drought or low rainfall hit many parts of the world, including Australia, which also saw its hottest year and hottest December on record and an exceptionally long and severe season of wildfires.

Some parts of the Arctic also burned - an extremely rare occurrence - and sea ice in the region continued to decline.

The Greenland ice sheet saw 329 billion tonnes of ice loss in 2019, well above the average for recent years, and glaciers continue to melt.

Sea levels were at record highs in 2019, and at least 84 per cent of the oceans experienced at least one marine heatwave.

Warming ocean temperatures, along with more acidic water and lower oxygen levels, are having an impact on marine wildlife and habitats such as coral.

Many scientists say the use of fossil fuels, which are one of the main sources of greenhouse gases, need to end by the middle of the century if average temperatures on Earth are to rise no more than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.

So far 70 countries have announced they are committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, joined by cities, banks, businesses and others, but this still represents only one-quarter of global emissions.

'The largest emitters must commit or our efforts will be in vain,' Guterres said.

In the coming months, the UN will be 'very actively engaging' Western Europe nations including the US, Canada, China, India, Russia and Japan.

This is 'in order to have as many as possible, ideally all of them, committed to carbon neutrality in 2050,' the secretary-general said.

Guterres pointed to 'good news' from the European Union, which unveiled plans last week for its first-ever climate law that would legally bind its executive arm to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.

'Let's hope that this example can be followed by all the others,' he said.",mainstream,M0ec71,climate.change
1111,"When a deadly virus that killed tens of thousands of European harbor seals in the northern Atlantic Ocean in 2002 began threatening sea lions, seals and otters in the northern Pacific Ocean, scientists were initially puzzled.

The highly contagious phocine distemper virus — which is not believed to affect humans — attacks the respiratory and nervous systems of some marine mammals. But there was no indication it had infected animals that could have taken it to different parts of the world.

“How did a virus that had previously been seen in the Atlantic Ocean end up in the Pacific Ocean?” said Tracey Goldstein, associate director of the One Health Institute at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine.

Goldstein and some of her colleagues examined 15 years of data that included measurements of Arctic sea ice and data from animals that had been tagged by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other institutions to study their migration patterns.

Their conclusion: Melting Arctic sea ice brought on by the Earth’s warming climate created a way for the virus to move into a new region and infect a new population of sea life.

“It was a perfect storm in 2002,” she said. “It was the lowest ice year on record at the time, and at the same time, in August and September, there was a really large outbreak.”

The work of Goldstein and her colleagues, published Wednesday in the journal Scientific Reports, also used blood and nasal swab samples from seals, sea lions and otters from southeast Alaska to Russia to assess which populations had been infected with the virus, and which specific strain they had been exposed to.

The researchers noticed a link between sea ice losses in the Arctic and spikes in outbreaks of the disease. In particular, the scientists found that drastic reductions in sea ice on the Russian side of the North Atlantic coincided with increases in exposure rates in both ocean basins. The melted ice, Goldstein said, was likely opening up new waterways for infected animals to come into contact with other species.

The study adds to growing research that global warming is having some unexpected impacts on animal and human health, such as increasing outbreaks of toxic algal blooms that can sicken marine animals and widening the range of ticks that carry potentially devastating diseases.

There’s no evidence to suggest that phocine distemper virus can be transmitted to humans, but the virus belongs to the same family as the measles. And like the measles, it’s highly virulent.

The virus is likely being spread among the animals when they gather to nest and breed, or when they feed in close proximity, according to the study’s lead author Elizabeth VanWormer, who conducted the research as a postdoctoral researcher at UC Davis but is now an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln.

Enabling transmission of the distemper virus is not the only way that climate change is impacting animal health. Along the west coast of the United States, warming ocean temperatures have intensified outbreaks of harmful algal blooms that can sicken marine mammals, said Shawn Johnson, the director of veterinary science at The Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, California, who was not involved with the new research.

“We’re seeing more and more of these toxic blooms affecting our animals,” Johnson said. “This is not unique. It’s just another important piece of evidence showing that climate change is impacting the marine mammals all up and down the West Coast.”

The study’s findings have implications not only for marine mammal populations but also the delicate balances that exist within ecosystems.

“When we see these changes happening in animals, we can’t ignore them, because the impacts on people and the planet are not far behind,” VanWormer said. ”This shows how interconnected these things are — the health of people, animals and the planet.”

The research should also act as a warning sign for the potential impacts that climate change can have on the ability to fight diseases and prevent their spread, according to Johnson.

“The climate is changing so rapidly,” he said. “Understanding how diseases and the ecology of diseases are changing in wildlife and marine mammals will give us insight into the future, and how we need to be prepared for a new paradigm of disease transmissions in animals and in humans.”",mainstream,M0762f,climate.change
44,"Dermatitis is a general term that describes a skin irritation. Dermatitis is a common condition that has many causes and occurs in many forms. It usually involves itchy, dry skin or a rash on swollen, reddened skin. Or it may cause the skin to blister, ooze, crust or flake off. Examples of this condition are atopic dermatitis (eczema), dandruff and contact dermatitis.

Dermatitis isn't contagious, but it can make you feel uncomfortable and self-conscious. Moisturizing regularly helps control the symptoms. Treatment may also include medicated ointments, creams and shampoos.

Each type of dermatitis may look a little different and tends to occur on different parts of your body. Signs and symptoms of different types of dermatitis include:
• Atopic dermatitis (eczema). Usually beginning in infancy, this red, itchy rash usually occurs where the skin flexes — inside the elbows, behind the knees and in front of the neck. The rash may leak fluid when scratched and crust over. People with atopic dermatitis may experience improvement and then seasonal flare-ups.
• Contact dermatitis. This red, itchy stinging rash occurs where your skin has come into contact with substances that irritate the skin or cause an allergic reaction. You may develop blisters.
• Seborrheic dermatitis. This condition causes scaly patches, red skin and stubborn dandruff. It usually affects oily areas of the body, such as the face, upper chest and back. Seborrheic dermatitis can be a long-term condition with periods of improvement and then seasonal flare-ups. In infants, this condition is called cradle cap.
• Follicular eczema. With this type, the affected skin thickens and develops bumps in hair follicles. This condition is common in African Americans and in people with dark-brown skin.

When to see a doctor

See your doctor if:
• You're so uncomfortable that you are losing sleep or are distracted from your daily routines
• You suspect your skin is infected
• You've tried self-care steps but your signs and symptoms persist

Causes of the most common types of dermatitis include:
• Atopic dermatitis (eczema). This type is likely related to dry skin, a gene variation, an immune system dysfunction, a skin infection, exposure to food, airborne, or contact allergens, or a combination of these.
• Contact dermatitis. This type results from contact with something that irritates your skin or causes an allergic reaction. Irritants or allergens include poison ivy, perfumes, jewelry containing nickel, cleaning products, and the preservatives in many creams and lotions.
• Seborrheic dermatitis. This type is caused by a yeast (fungus) that is in the oil secretion on the skin.
• Age. Dermatitis can occur at any age, but atopic dermatitis (eczema) usually begins in infancy.
• Allergies and asthma. People who have a personal or family history of eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma are more likely to develop atopic dermatitis.
• Occupation. Jobs that put you in contact with certain metals, solvents or cleaning supplies increase your risk of contact dermatitis. Being a health care worker is linked to hand eczema.
• Health conditions. Health conditions that put you at increased risk of seborrheic dermatitis include congestive heart failure, Parkinson's disease and HIV/AIDS.

Scratching the itchy rash associated with dermatitis can cause open sores, which may become infected. These skin infections can spread and may very rarely become life-threatening.

Wear protective clothing if you are doing a task that involves irritants or caustic chemicals.

Avoid dry skin by adopting these habits when bathing:
• Take shorter baths and showers. Limit your baths and showers to 5 to 10 minutes. Use warm, rather than hot, water. Bath oil also may be helpful.
• Use a gentle, nonsoap cleanser. Choose unscented nonsoap cleansers. Some soaps can dry your skin.
• Dry yourself gently. After bathing, gently pat your skin dry with a soft towel.
• Moisturize your skin. While your skin is still damp, seal in moisture with an oil, cream or lotion. Try different products to find one that works for you. Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented. Two small studies showed that applying a protective moisturizer to the skin of infants at high risk of atopic dermatitis reduced the incidence of the condition by up to 50 percent.",mainstream,M0f442,climate.change
422,"Thousands of scientists around the world joined together last month to label climate change the “emergency” that it is. But one of the main points they make — linking control of women’s reproduction to environmental goals — is problematic. Focusing on what women in poor nations with the highest birth rates can do to curb climate change distracts from holding wealthy countries and corporations accountable for their disproportionate harm to the planet and imperils the right to reproductive autonomy.

The paper, “World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency,” was published in early November on the 40th anniversary of the first world climate conference. It rightfully warns of “untold suffering” without “major transformations in the ways our global society functions.”

Reducing population growth is one of six steps the authors say would slow carbon dioxide emissions. They also argue that to decrease the birthrate, family planning services and primary and secondary education need to be more available and accessible.

The group’s website goes a big step further. It says families must be encouraged to have fewer children and sounds the overpopulation alarm. A startling graph shows a dramatic world population spike beginning in the 19th century. The accompanying text refers to people giving birth as “adding more carbon emitters to the planet.” This presents a troubling and unfair picture and promotes the scapegoating of women.

Access to family planning and education are essential to gender equity and must be fiercely promoted in their own right. But arguing that they are an instrument against climate change implies that the most disenfranchised have an outsize role to play in the fight because of higher birth rates, when in reality they contribute very little to greenhouse gas emissions.

High- and upper-middle-income countries have higher per-capita emissions and account for 86% of global carbon emissions, despite having the lowest fertility rates. And even though some observers argue economic development will lead to higher per-capita carbon emissions from poor countries in the future, the global scientific and policy communities’ response should be laser-focused on bold systemic changes, such as restraining the use of fossil fuels, rather than persuading people to have fewer children.

Emphasizing population reduction as a response to global warming is also problematic because it may provide a perverse incentive for family planning services to lose sight of people’s right to make their own decisions about contraception and childbearing. The scientists’ warning rightly says that family planning programs should be voluntary and ethical, but those concepts can start to blur when women’s choices are put in competition with the future of the planet.

Historically, population growth alarmism coupled with eugenic ideas about who is worthy of reproducing has led to a painful global legacy of coercion and abuse — including, most prominently, cases of forced sterilization in India and China’s one-child policy.

Such blatant examples have been less common in the years since the landmark 1994 International Conference on Population and Development marked a shift away from population control toward protecting reproductive health and rights. However, those ideas haven’t died. Just four years ago, Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich, who wrote the 1968 book “The Population Bomb,” said he would endorse “various forms of coercion” to keep people from having more children.

An inherent and unresolvable tension remains between viewing family planning as a tool to mitigate climate change and valuing an individual’s right to choose to have a child.

Framing family planning as a means to an end — especially when the “end” is as urgent and important as slowing climate change — could lead anxious policymakers and healthcare providers focused on reducing population to push contraceptive methods that are considered more effective, without regard for a woman’s needs and preferences. It could also lead them to be less likely to make sure women are able to have provider-controlled methods — such as intrauterine devices or contraceptive implants — removed on demand.

Curbing climate change and making high-quality, rights-based contraception and abortion services accessible to those who want them are both urgent issues that deserve attention and resources.

However, the misplaced emphasis on poor women’s reproduction risks sacrificing human rights to chip away at climate change, a massive problem that needs transformational solutions. And it also distracts from the fact that poor communities are the least likely to have the resources to mitigate the devastating impact of climate change on their lives and livelihoods, and thus have the most to lose. Even if women in poor countries stopped having children tomorrow, without massive decarbonization of the economy neither the planet nor their lives will be any better off now or in the future.

As climate-change scientists continue to push the world toward urgent action, they should avoid family planning as a solution. Instead, they can follow the lead of the climate justice movement and promote a human-rights-based approach that holds governments and businesses accountable for reducing reliance on fossil fuels — and for mitigating the disproportionate burden borne by the most poor and disenfranchised. A bold vision for tackling the climate emergency requires nothing less.

906,"The federal government is ill-prepared to shoulder what could be a trillion-dollar fiscal crisis associated with extreme weather, floods, wildfires and other climate disasters through 2100, federal investigators have found.

In the latest of a series of reports, the Government Accountability Office says that costs of disaster assistance to taxpayers since 2005 have swelled to nearly $500 billion—and they keep getting higher.

“The federal budget, however, does not generally account for disaster assistance provided by Congress or the long-term impacts of climate change on existing federal infrastructure and programs,” GAO found in the 16-page report, which was presented as testimony to Congress by Alfredo Gómez, director of the office’s natural resources and environment team.

Moreover, the government “does not have certain information needed by policymakers to help understand the budgetary impacts of such exposure,” GAO found.

The findings follow a dramatic escalation in federal spending on disaster assistance since 2005. Much of that money—upward of $450 billion—has been appropriated under supplemental spending packages following disasters rather than through the normal budgetary process.

In 2018, Congress approved $91 billion in disaster spending to help communities recover from hurricanes, floods, wildfire and drought. The outflow of disaster dollars has continued into 2019; Congress has passed bills authorizing an additional $19.1 billion, according to federal figures.

The growing frequency and intensity of disasters is being felt in every region of the country and across a broad cross-section of the economy, from energy and real estate to farming and fisheries.

The report includes 21 examples of climate change’s economic impacts, most of which will place additional strain on federal resources. They include infrastructure damage in coastal zones from sea-level rise and storm surges, increased heat-related mortality in the Southeast and Midwest, changes in water supply and demand in the West, and decreased agricultural yields in the southern Plains and Southwest.

GAO also identified two types of potential benefits from climate change: fewer deaths from cold weather in the Upper Midwest and improved agricultural yields in the northern Great Plains and parts of the Northwest, mainly associated with longer growing seasons.

Financial exposure to climate disasters will be felt hardest in three pots of government spending: disaster response, flood and crop insurance, and operation and management of federally owned property and public lands.

Investigators noted that the National Flood Insurance Program, for example, owes the U.S. Treasury $21 billion associated with massive payouts to flood victims dating back to 2005.

Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in May 2019 that federal crop insurance would cost the government an average of about $8 billion annually from 2019 through 2029 due to worsening floods, droughts and other climate stressors.

Federal properties, like Tyndall Air Force Base on the Florida Panhandle, are also facing increased financial exposure from hurricanes and other extreme weather events, GAO said. Hurricane Michael virtually destroyed Tyndall in 2018, and its reconstruction is estimated to cost more than $4 billion (Climatewire, July 3).

Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst and expert on climate adaptation and resilience at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said GAO’s findings are consistent with previous warnings from financial experts that the costs of climate disasters are far exceeding the government’s ability to pay.

Federal agencies “are still treating these disasters as random events. We just throw a bunch of money at them after the fact and assume they won’t happen again. The problem is we’re having these types of disasters every year now,” Moore said.

Spending hundreds of billions of dollars in disaster-specific supplemental relief cannot continue, he added.

“We need to both start accounting for the growing need to respond to disasters within the regular appropriations process,” Moore said. “More importantly, we need to start making investments that reduce our exposure and vulnerability to these types of damages.”

382,"Antarctica Breaks 69°F for the First Time on Record

The Antarctic region just recorded a temperature higher than 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time.

Brazilian scientists measured a temperature of 20.75 degrees Celsius (approximately 69.35 degrees Fahrenheit) on Seymour Island Feb. 9, one of the researchers told AFP Thursday.

The record was broken three days after the Antarctic continent recorded its highest temperature to date at a balmy 18.3 degrees Celsius (approximately 64.9 degrees Fahrenheit). That measure was taken at Argentina’s Esperanza station on the Antarctic peninsula that extends north towards South America.

The Brazilian reading was taken on one of the islands that extends off that peninsula, according to BBC News. It breaks the previous record for the entire Antarctic region, defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as all the land and ice south of 60 degrees. The previous record for the region of 19.8 degrees Celsius (approximately 67.6 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded in 1982 on Signy Island.

Schaefer was careful to point out that the temperature reading was not part of a larger study and so could not be used as evidence of a climate trend.

However, Antarctica as a whole has warmed by almost three degrees Celsius over the past 50 years, according to WMO data reported by BBC News. During that time, about 87 percent of the glaciers on its western coast have retreated. The region also just recorded its warmest January on record.

Schaefer works as part of Brazil’s Terrantar project that studies 23 sites in Antarctica. Temperatures on the peninsula, the South Shetland Islands and the James Ross archipelago cooled during the first decade of the 21st century, and then began to rise quickly, he told The Guardian.

The peninsula and its surrounding islands have been the areas of Antarctica most impacted by the climate crisis so far, which means they might indicate how the rest of the region will react.

If all of the ice in Antarctica were to melt, it would cause 50 to 60 meters (approximately 164 to 197 feet) of sea level rise. This would take centuries, however. In the nearer term, scientists predict 30 to 110 centimeters (approximately 12 to 43 inches) of sea level rise by 2100, depending on how successfully greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and how the ice reacts.",conspiracy,C02e93,climate.change
700,"U.S. stocks and indices have lifted to new highs in a dramatic recovery from the initial wave of coronavirus fears but the world’s energy markets have not, dropping the WTI crude oil futures contract to the lowest low since January 2019. Worse yet, it’s now testing psychological and technical support at 50 for the fourth time in 13 months, raising odds for a breakdown that brings the deep December 2018 at 42.36 into play.

As a consumer, you might think that cheap crude oil prices are great for the economy and your family’s bottom line. However, the contract is a highly-cyclical instrument that tracks economic expansion and contraction with surprising accuracy. Right now, the selloff is waving a red flag, telling us that energy traders are worried that world economies will enter recessionary waves as a result of China’s isolation and the potential escalation into other parts of the world.

More importantly from a technical standpoint, a decline into the 2018 low will mark the next phase in a massive 17-year descending triangle pattern, with support at the 2009 low in the lower 30s. The contract last tested that critical level in early 2016, breaking down into the mid-20s before reversing gears and remounting broken support. It’s failed to post a higher high in the last 4 years, maintaining a secular downtrend that’s now entered its 12th year.

Climate activists may view crude oil’s decline as a positive development, with more industries moving away from fossil fuels and into carbon-neutral energy sources. However, it’s unlikely that paradigm shift has reached critical mass, given healthy demand as a result of the multiyear economic expansion. In addition, dwindling crude oil resources around the world in coming years is likely to generate a premium for the commodity, with remaining users forced to pay up due to lower supply.

Fortunately, the evolution of crude oil prices has been moving at a snail’s pace, telling market players there’s plenty of time to take action if exposed to the industry through energy stocks or the futures markets. However, as we learned in 2008, contract volatility can escalate rapidly in response to system shocks like that year’s economic collapse, so it makes sense to keep a watch on price action at all times.

The contract soared from the mid-teens into the lower 40s in just 4 months in 1990, driven higher by the first Iraqi invasion. It settled back to earth a few months later, reentering a multiyear trading range that broke to the upside once again in 2004 when world economies were getting back on the feet after the burst Internet bubble. The uptrend went parabolic in 2006, driven by heavy speculation as a result of China’s multi-trillion dollar industrial expansion.

A vertical plunge followed 2008’s all-time high at 147.47, dropping the contract into a test at breakout support in the first quarter of 2009. It made steady progress into 2011, finally reversing a few points under the .786 Fibonacci selloff retracement level. That marked the highest high in the last 9 years, ahead of a broad trading range that broke to the downside in 2014. That selloff printed the first lower monthly high for the contract in more than two decades.

The decline found support at the 2009 low at the start of 2016, giving way to a healthy uptick that stalled after President Trump fired the first shot of the trade war in 2018. It printed the second lower high in 7 years at that time, turning south at the .50 retracement of the 2-year slide. This downturn found support in the low 40s at the end of the year but the contract failed to make headway in 2019 and may be headed into a critical test at the 2016 low.

The WTI crude oil contract may have entered the next phase of a massive descending triangle pattern that forecasts much lower prices in coming decades.

390,"Regional Australian students were surveyed to explore their understanding and knowledge of the greenhouse effect, ozone depletion and climate change. Results were compared with a parallel study undertaken in 1991 in a regional UK city.

The comparison was conducted to investigate whether more awareness and understanding of these issues is demonstrated by students as a result of over 16 years’ accumulated knowledge, increased certainty among experts of greenhouse effects on climate, media publicity and inclusion of the greenhouse effect in the Australian school curriculum.

Data obtained from a combined sample of 740 Year 8/10 secondary students examined the extent of student understanding and knowledge, models of explanation and sources of information of the phenomena. A path analytic, Structural Equation Model (SEM) tested links between student understanding of the greenhouse effect, knowledge of greenhouse gases and experience of being in a greenhouse, to conceptions of climate change.

113,"ouTube has been “actively promoting” videos containing misinformation about climate change, a report released Thursday by campaign group Avaaz claims, despite recent policy changes by the platform intended to drive users away from harmful content and conspiracy theories.

Avaaz examined 5,537 videos retrieved by the search terms “climate change,” global warming” and “climate manipulation,” and then the videos most likely to be suggested next by YouTube’s “up next” sidebar. For each of those search terms respectively, 8%, 16% and 21% of the top 100 related videos included by YouTube in the “up-next” feature contained information that goes against the scientific consensus on climate change – such as denying climate change is taking place, or claiming that human activity is not a cause of climate change. Avaaz claims this promotion process means YouTube is helping to spread climate denialism.

“We’ve found that it’s very likely that at least one in five users who search for a term like global warming or climate change could be sent down this type of misinformation rabbit hole,” says Fadi Quran, a campaigns director at Avaaz, and one of the report’s authors. “Scientists are working so hard to educate people about the existential threat we face and YouTube is allowing bad actors among us the last word on this issue for many people.”

Smaller scale studies have previously suggested that a majority of climate-related videos on YouTube oppose the scientific consensus on climate change.

The “up next” feature dictates what users watch for 70% of the time they spend on YouTube. The exact make-up of the YouTube algorithm that drives recommendations, designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible, is a closely guarded secret. Experts say the algorithm appears to have learned that radical or outrageous content is more likely to engage viewers.

When it comes to climate change, Avaaz says, that leads to the promotion of controversial videos with titles such as “Global warming is a hoax” and “ACTUAL SCIENTIST: Climate Change is a Scam!” The algorithm is also personalized to each user, meaning that after you watch one video containing climate misinformation, it is more likely to recommend another for you.

In January 2019, responding to criticism over the platform’s tendency to drive people towards more radical political and social viewpoints, YouTube announced that in the U.S. it would begin reducing recommendations of “borderline” content that pushed the limits of Community Guidelines on areas like hate speech, as well as “content that could misinform users in harmful ways—such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11”. In December, YouTube said that policy had been successful, driving down the average time spent by U.S. users watching recommended “borderline” content or harmful misinformation by 70%.

But Quran says it remains unclear if that policy is effectively applied to climate denialist content. “They say all scientifically inaccurate information that causes harm is included under that policy—which should indicate that climate denial is part of it,” he says. “However [YouTube’s parent company] is not transparent and our research so far indicates that climate denial videos are still being actively recommended. Either their downgrading tools are not working as they should, or they have decided to exclude climate denial from the system.”

A YouTube spokesperson tells TIME, “We can’t speak to Avaaz’s methodology or results, and our recommendations systems are not designed to filter or demote videos or channels based on specific perspectives.” They add that YouTube’s systems “prioritize authoritative voices for millions of news and information queries, and surface information panels on topics prone to misinformation — including climate change — to provide users with context alongside their content” and that the systems appear to have done so “in the majority of cases in this report”.

Ads for major brands appeared alongside the videos containing climate misinformation seen by Avaaz. The campaign group claims that by promoting climate denial videos to drive more viewing time, and by placing ads alongside these videos, YouTube is profiting from the spread of misinformation.

The YouTube spokesperson says they have “strict ad policies that govern where ads are allowed to appear and we give advertisers tools to opt out of content that doesn’t align with their brand.”

Pressure from advertisers, some of whom Avaaz informed about their findings, could potentially push YouTube to take more action on climate denial content. An advertising boycott in 2017, when brands sought to prevent their ads appearing alongside extremist content, cost Google millions of dollars in revenue, and helped drive YouTube to strengthen efforts to limit how often its platform surfaced extremist content. (As well as reducing the promotion of borderline content, in June, the platform began removing thousands of videos displaying white supremacism and other hateful ideologies.)

Stephan Lewandowsky, chair of the cognitive psychology department at the University of Bristol, who studies climate misinformation, says the question isn’t whether YouTube could deal with climate denialism on its platform, but whether there the company’s leadership have the political will to do so when there is not yet “political consensus” in all countries around climate change. “With the radical Islamist and the white supremacist material [that YouTube has been successful in policing], they recognized that was something they definitely couldn’t get away with [hosting],” he says. “With climate denial, even though it is a scientifically totally absurd position, there are plenty of politicians in the U.S. and Australia, for example, who are immersed in this stuff.”

Misinformation around climate change and its impacts are still commonplace in some prominent mainstream media. On Jan. 14, James Murdoch, son of Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch, criticized the “ongoing denial” of the climate crisis displayed by his father’s news outlets, particularly in coverage of Australia’s current bushfire crisis.

For Lewandowsky, the promotion of climate denialism, both in the media and to YouTube users searching for content about climate change, creates a major stumbling block to political momentum on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. “For many people who are not trained scientists,” he says, “the moment they’re exposed to what appears to be a scientific debate—but isn’t actually, because the science was settled a long time ago— they feel they can say “Oh, well, the scientists don’t agree on this—we don’t have to do anything.”

594,"The real climate debate is not between “believers” and “deniers”.

And not between Republicans and Democrats.

The real debate is certainly not over whether global warming, spurred by increasing greenhouse gases, is a serious problem that must be addressed. Both sides of the real climate debate agree on that.

The real rebate is between two groups:

1. A confident, non-political group that believes technology, informed investments, rational decision making, and the use of the best scientific information will lead to a solution of the global warming issue. An optimistic group that sees global warming as a technical problem with technical solutions. I will refer to these folks as the ACT group (Apolitical/Confident/Technical)

2. A group, mainly on the political left, that is highly partisan, anxious and often despairing, self-righteous, big on blame and social justice, and willing to attack those that disagree with them. They often distort the truth when it serves their interests. They also see social change as necessary for dealing with global warming, requiring the very reorganization of society. I call these folks the ASP group (Anxious, Social-Justice, Partisan).

There is no better way to see the profound difference between these two groups than to watch a video of the testimony of young activists at the recent House Hearing on Climate Change, which included Greta Thunberg, Jamie Margolin, Vic Barrett, and Benji Backer.

Jamie Margolin of Seattle talked about an apocalyptic future, with “corporations making billions” while they destroy the future of her generation. Of feeling fear and despair. Of a planet where the natural environment is undergoing collapse, where only a few years are left before we pass the point of no return, and where only a massive political shift can fix things, including the Green New Deal. Watch her testimony to see what I mean.

Compare Ms. Margolin’s testimony to that of University of Washington senior Benji Backer.

 Mr. Backer, leader of the American Conservation Coalition, a conservative/moderate group of young people supporting action to protect the environment, approaches the problem in a radically different way. Instead of despair, there is optimism, recommending more scientific and technical research, a bipartisan attack on the problem, a rejection of an apocalyptic future, the building of new energy industries with potential benefits for the American economy, and a dedication to follow the science and not political expediency. His testimony is here.

Both Ms. Margolin and Mr. Backer care deeply about the environment and want effective measures to deal with global warming. Both their approaches and attitudes could not be more different.

We see the difference between the optimistic ACT group and the despairing ASP folks here in Seattle.

On one hand, there is the Clean Tech Alliance, which brings together technology companies, university researchers, and the business community to develop and apply the technologies that will produce the carbon-free future we look for. Headed by Tom Ranken, the Alliance does a lot, including a highly informative breakfast series where you can learn about fusion power, new battery technologies, the future of solid waste recycling, and much more. Non-political, optimistic, and exciting. These are clearly members of the ACT group.

In contrast, there is Seattle’s 350.org group. They are into climate strikes, staging protests (like their recent blockade of a branch of Seattle Chase Bank), trying to muzzle climate scientists they don’t like, advocating political solutions to greenhouse warming (Green New Deal), pushing divestment of energy companies, and even a Pledge of Resistance to stop energy exports by whatever means necessary . Their “science” page has all kinds of extreme (and unfounded) claims regarding global warming impacts, like a sea level rise of 10 feet in as little as 50 years. ASP group all the way.

I should note that the Seattle 350.org group and their “allies” oppose the Tacoma Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) Facility that will help replace the extraordinarily dirty “bunker fuel” used in ships traversing Puget Sound. LNG will also reduce carbon emissions. Scientists and regulators at the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency support the LNG facility. But facts and protection of the health of Puget Sound residents are not priorities for highly politicized groups like 350.org.

 A good example of the differences between the ACT and ASP folks is found in Washington State’s recent carbon initiatives.

 Initiative 732 was backed by Carbon Washington, a non-political group whose bi-partisan proposal would have increased the price of carbon fuels but was revenue neutral, giving all the funds collected back to the citizens of the State. Carefully designed and impactful. The work of the ACT group all the way.

But the ASP folks were unhappy. There was no money for their climate justice and political initiatives, so they opposed it, and were joined by Governor Inslee and the environmental left. Unforgivable, nasty attacks were made on Carbon Washington leadership by the ASP folks. 732 lost.

 The ASP collective decided it was their turn, so they created a Frankenstein carbon initiative (1631), with a lowered (less effective) carbon fee, but one in which climate justice groups and political allies on the left would have control, and were hardwired for much of the funds. The main advertising line of the 1631 ads: catastrophe was around the corner and the big oil companies were to blame. 1631 was an election day disaster, losing by 13 points, and the ASP folks have probably killed any hope for an effective carbon tax/fee in our state.

What about the media? Which side are they on? ASP or ACT or neither?

 Much of the “mainstream” media parrots the message of the ASP side. The Seattle Times is a great case in point, with headlines of massive heat related deaths (750 die per event!) and catastrophic wildfire seasons that have no basis in good science. But there are plenty of others, such as the LA Times and the NY Times. There are some major media outlets that are more balanced (such as the Wall Street Journal). A major issue for the media is the hollowing out of science reporting, with most climate stories being handled by general reporters with neither the time, background, or inclination to get beyond parroting the press releases of activist groups or evaluating the claims of speculative research papers. It has gotten so bad that a recent headline story in the Seattle Times kept on talking about the WRONG GAS (carbon monoxide instead of carbon dioxide).

A Religious Movement

 In many ways, the ASP group appears to be a religious movement, not unlike the many millennialist movements of the past. As other groups in the past, they predict an apocalyptic future (including fire and brimstone!) and that one must “believe” in their viewpoint or be rejected as a “denier.” The ASP folks have a holy viewpoint that comes from authority (they claim based on the views of 97% of scientists). There is no debate allowed, the science is “settled.” Sounds like religious dogma.

 The ASP movement describes a world that is teetering on the edge, with mankind’s days numbers (10 or 12 years according to several of their leading prophets) unless immediate steps are taken. They constantly repeat that the threat is existential.

 They believe it is ok to distort the truth to get folks “to do the right thing.” The ASP group has well defined “enemies” that represent true evil (Trump, Republicans, Big Oil, Koch Brothers) and they support attacking and silencing those they disagree with (my past blog gives you some documented examples of such behavior). ASP has their priests (Al Gore, Bill McKibben, Michael Mann) and even young saints (Greta Thunberg). As in many such movements, members are guided to act in approved and enlightened ways, but the leadership does not need to follow the rules (e.g., many ASP “leaders” have huge carbon footprints from flying). Importantly, ASP sees their work going much further than a technical fix for technical problem, but as a “social justice” movement that will change the very organization of society.

 Disturbingly, the ASP folks are against key technologies that could really make a difference, such as nuclear power, and are relatively uninterested in working on adaptation and resilience to climate change. Many do not support dealing with our forests in a rational way (e.g., restoration with thinning and prescribed burning) but would rather blame it all on global warming.

By pushing a highly political agenda the ASP movement is undermining bipartisan efforts–and nothing important will be done unless both sides of the aisle are involved. ASP folks love to say that the Republicans are unwilling to deal with climate change, a totally unfair claim. I have talked personally to leading WA Republicans, like Bill Bryant and Rob McKenna. They acknowledge the seriousness of global warming and the need to act. In my talks in highly Republican eastern Washington, growers and others accept the problem and want to work on solutions. Under a Republican U.S. Congress, funding for climate research has been protected and increased. But partisan attacks by the ASP group is seen as a way to promote group cohesion and the “evil” of the other side. Calling others names is not an effective way to secure their cooperation.

 A problem for the ASP group is that their message is so dark, pessimistic and depressing that it tends to turn others off. And it has a terrible psychological effects on its adherents and those that listen. Fear, anxiety, feelings of hopelessness, despair, and rage. There are even classes on dealing with eco-anxiety and climate grief. Greta Thunberg said that the worry ruined her childhood.

And yes, there is President Trump. Much of what he says on climate change is simply nonsensical, and quite frankly he is not part of the debate. Republicans in Congress do not follow his lead. But he is a convenient foil for the ASP folks, who use him for their own purposes.

The Bottom Line

 Progress on climate change is being undermined by the efforts of the highly vocal, partisan, and ineffective ASP group. They are standing in the way of bipartisan action on climate change, efforts to fix our forests, and the use of essential technologies. They are a big part of the problem, not the solution.

 In contrast to the ASP folks, the ACT group generally tries to stay out of the public eye, quietly completing the work needed to develop the technologies and infrastructure that will allow us to mitigate and adapt to climate change. In the end, they will save us. That is, if the ASP folks don’t get in their way.

Traffic-free roads, plane-free skies and widespread brick-and-mortar closings have made the planet a beneficiary of the coronavirus pandemic — but only in the short term.

Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer at Greenpeace in Beijing, said it's not time to ""pop the champagne corks"" just yet.

""It's hardly a sustainable way to reduce emissions,"" he said.

Many climate experts spotlighted 2020 as a critical year to take decisive action to limit the worst impacts of global warming. The year started with international attention on catastrophic wildfires and floods.

The pandemic has overshadowed those issues — but with an environmental silver lining. The sharp reductions documented in carbon emissions and air pollution caused by coronavirus-related lockdowns have offered a sort of preview of the kind of improvements that can be made when drastic action is taken.

But the changes could easily be wiped out by efforts to quickly ramp up economies, including governments around the world that may be more willing to relax regulations to jump-start companies.

Despite an estimate showing that China — the world's biggest polluter — emitted 25 percent less carbon than in the same four-week period the previous year, Shuo remains skeptical about any lasting changes. He said he's worried that efforts to reignite China's economy might end up making the coronavirus epidemic a step backward for climate efforts.

That's because if history is anything to go by, China might not take the greenest option.

Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, based in Finland, said China responded to the 2008 financial crisis with the ""biggest, dirtiest stimulus program in the history of mankind.""

""It meant that for the following three years there was rapid growth in CO2 emissions, and we can now say with quite a bit of certainty that the overall impact was to nudge China on a more carbon-intensive, fossil fuel-intensive economy path,"" Myllyvirta said.

How other nations handle their responses to the economic shock will also be critical.

There are some glimmers of hope that ambitious climate action could play a part. European Union leaders have said the recently announced Green Deal must be at the heart of an ""intelligent recovery."" In spite of pressure to soften its green ambitions because of the pandemic, the EU has begun a consultation on tightening its carbon reduction targets by 2030.

Things look less promising in the U.S. Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed that the Trump administration had relaxed enforcement of regulations to help polluting industries deal with the pandemic. Gina McCarthy, who directed the EPA in the administration of President Barack Obama, called the announcement ""a license to pollute.""

Meanwhile, some industries in the U.S. and Europe are pushing to relax other regulations.

The plastics industry, recently on its back foot over ocean pollution fears, has worked to turn the tide on plastic bag bans.

Although the science is far from clear, plastic makers have long argued that single-use plastics are safer and more sanitary than reusable alternatives. Plastics Industry Association CEO Tony Radosewski recently stressed the need for more single-use plastics to combat the spread of the virus in a letter March 18 to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

And it seems that many lawmakers are listening.

Plastic bag restrictions have been lifted across the country. In New York and Maine, recently introduced bans have been delayed. In Connecticut, plastic bag fees have been removed, while in New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Sununu prohibited shoppers from bringing reusable bags and ordered stores to make disposable bags available.

Likewise, the crisis has been a boon for the auto industry, with the Trump administration seizing the moment to fulfill a campaign promise to weaken Obama-era emissions standards. Automakers in the EU are also lobbying for a delay in tightening emissions restrictions because of the crisis. And in China, plans for tougher standards look likely to be delayed to help struggling automakers.

Airlines including Delta and JetBlue started off the year promising carbon offsets amid a growing culture of ""flight shaming."" The airline industry is also lobbying for government bailouts and regulation relief.

With governments focused on the crisis, there are also fears that the diplomatic push to refocus global efforts on reducing emissions could slip.

The United Nations' COP 26 climate conference, scheduled to be held in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, has been postponed until 2021. It had been hailed as the most important climate gathering since the Paris climate accord was signed in 2015. Under that agreement, countries are due to come back to the table with new pledges to limit warming to the agreed-upon level of ""well below 2 degrees"" Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and ideally below 1.5 degrees.

It's ""abundantly clear that the countries of the world are falling short of the goals of the Paris agreement,"" said Dr. Simon Evans, deputy editor of Carbon Brief, a climate science website.

""Current pledges have the world on track for warming of about 3 degrees"" Celsius, he added.

Environmentalists have already raised concerns after Japan — the world's fifth-biggest emitter — became the first G7 country to announce its new targets. The plan, however, would simply maintain the country's existing emission reduction pledges. The World Resources Institute, a research nonprofit based in Washington, criticized the approach for falling ""woefully short.""

A successful outcome in Glasgow, therefore, looks likely to require extensive preparatory work and diplomacy. As Evans said, the Paris agreement was ""built on years of diplomatic efforts on the part of the French government and the whole French diplomatic service over the course of about three years.""

Although the postponement of the climate conference does provide welcome extra time for work toward a successful summit, he argued that it is ""inevitable that countries' preparatory work toward their new pledges"" will have been affected.

So while the world looks likely to emerge from the pandemic — at least temporarily — with cleaner air and lower emissions, ""any positive environmental impact"" from the crisis relies on our ""changing our production and consumption habits towards cleaner and greener,"" Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program, wrote this week.

Jones and his high-level CIA insider sources – Patriots all – believe that “forewarned is forearmed.” Don’t be afraid: be prepared.

The purpose of this article and Jones’ message is to raise public awareness of how the globalists are using terrorism to take our rights – from 2nd Amendment gun grabbing to 4th Amendment airport body scanners.

These CIA insiders told Jones that three months ago “sources outside of President Trump” threatened North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to surrender or EMP (electromagnetic pulse) weapons would be detonated over American cities New York and Los Angeles, Riyadh (the capital of Saudi Arabia), and London (the capital of England). The power grid would blink out in an instant, catapulting affected regions back to the days before electric utilities.

Deprived of grocery stores and the means to cook food, civil unrest would be inevitable. As American investigative journalist and lawyer Alfred Henry Lewis put it, in 1906:

“There are only nine meals between mankind and anarchy.”

Staggering economic losses coupled with societal rioting would lead to a new limited nuclear war, between North Korea and China, provoking the western nations to retaliate in kind against North Korea. The globalists would hide out in their underground bunkers for a year before emerging to the world they envision, with only half a billion people to control.

The globalists have planned all along to use North Korea to start war in the South China Sea which would then spread to the rest of the world.

Meanwhile, Trump was making his own plans for peace and prosperity by opening unprecedented peace talks with Kim Jong-un. One chief requirement would be for North Korea to stop their nuclear arms program. To achieve this end, Trump was willing to use force, if necessary. Jones’ sources indicated that the Commander-in-Chief was prepared to “strike them in March 2018 if he didn’t roll over.”

In a secret meeting held either March 31 or April 1, CIA director and Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo to open negotiations with the North Korean leader.

Afterward, Trump tweeted success, underscoring the “lightning pace” of the new diplomatic relationship between the two countries:

“Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!”

On April 20, 2018, mainstream media sources like NBC News broadcast stunning news: Kim Jong-Un announced that North Korea “has suspended nuclear and long-range missile tests, claiming further tests are unnecessary” because his country has “reached the target stage, where the nation and people’s safety is reliably secured.”

After all the saber rattling we’ve heard from Kim Jong-Un in recent years, this proclamation seems odd – unless we factor in Trump’s alleged threat to (effectively) sue for peace by using the threat of force.

Trump’s refusal to go along with the globalist plan effectively makes him – and all freedom-loving Patriots – a target.

Jones repeated his warning: the globalists have threatened to use satellite-based EMP weapons to shut off all the electricity and create starvation. They will blame North Korea in the hopes of triggering a much bigger war, which, in turn, will be used to justify the creation of a global military government, currency, and police force – with no more Constitutional freedoms as we know them today.

Knowledge is power. Spread the word that power-mad, self-serving global elites are plotting to undermine the Trump administration’s peace-seeking diplomacy with North Korea. They plan to use terrorist sleeper cell attacks this coming summer to make North Korea a scape-goat in order to prevent progress toward cooperation among nations.

1151,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up in 1988 to asses information on climate change and its impact. It's Fourth Assessment Report predicts that global temperatures could rise from anything between 1.1C to 6.4C by the end of the century. Although the issue of the changing climate is very complex and some changes are uncertain, temperature rises are expected to affect countries throughout the globe and have a knock on effect with precipitation and sea level rises. The Fourth Assessment Report concluded that we can say with high confidence (>90% probability) that the effect of human activities since 1750 has been to warm the planet. It is also says that it is very likely (>90% probability) that observed temperature increases since the middle of the twentieth century have been caused by the increase in manmade greenhouse gas concentrations. The report believes that it is very likely that hot extremes, heat waves, and heavy precipitation events will continue to become more frequent. By the second half of the 21st century, wintertime precipitation in the northern mid to high latitudes and Antarctica will rise. At the same time, Australasia, Central America and Southern Africa are likely to see decreases in winter precipitation. New data presented by scientists at an international meeting in Copenhagen (March 2009) indicated that the best estimates of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made only two years earlier, in relation to the rise in water levels was woefully out of date and seen as far too conservative.",mainstream,M10b59,climate.change
1201,"The path of future climate change will depend on what courses of action are taken by society—in particular the emission of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. A range of alternative emissions scenarios known as representative concentration pathways (RCPs) were proposed by the IPCC in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), which was published in 2014, to examine potential future climate changes. The scenarios depend on various assumptions concerning future rates of human population growth, economic development, energy demand, technological advancement, and other factors. Unlike the scenarios used in previous IPCC assessments, the AR5 RCPs explicitly account for climate change mitigation efforts.

Graph of the predicted increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in Earth's atmosphere according to a series of climate change scenarios that assume different levels of economic development, population growth, and fossil fuel use.

The results of each scenario in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (2007) are depicted in the graph.

The AR5 scenario with the smallest increases in greenhouse gases is RCP 2.6, which denotes the net radiative forcing by 2100 in watts per square metre (a doubling of CO concentrations from preindustrial values of 280 ppm to 560 ppm represents roughly 3.7 watts per square metre). RCP 2.6 assumes substantial improvements in energy efficiency, a rapid transition away from fossil fuel energy, and a global population that peaks at roughly nine billion people in the 21st century. In that scenario CO concentrations remain below 450 ppm and actually fall toward the end of the century (to about 420 ppm) as a result of widespread deployment of carbon-capture technology.

Scenario RCP 8.5, by contrast, might be described as “business as usual.” It reflects the assumption of an energy-intensive global economy, high population growth, and a reduced rate of technological development. CO concentrations are more than three times greater than preindustrial levels (roughly 936 ppm) by 2100 and continue to grow thereafter. RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 envision intermediate policy choices, resulting in stabilization by 2100 of CO concentrations at 538 and 670 ppm, respectively. In all those scenarios, the cooling effect of industrial pollutants such as sulfate particulates, which have masked some of the past century’s warming, is assumed to decline to near zero by 2100 because of policies restricting their industrial production.

The differences between the various simulations arise from disparities between the various climate models used and from assumptions made by each emission scenario. For example, best estimates of the predicted increases in global surface temperature between the years 2000 and 2100 range from about 0.3 to 4.8 °C (0.5 to 8.6 °F), depending on which emission scenario is assumed and which climate model is used. Relative to preindustrial (i.e., 1750–1800) temperatures, these estimates reflect an overall warming of the globe of 1.4 to 5.0 °C (2.5 to 9.0 °F). These projections are conservative in that they do not take into account potential positive carbon cycle feedbacks (see above Feedback mechanisms and climate sensitivity). Only the lower-end emissions scenario RCP 2.6 has a reasonable chance (roughly 50 percent) of holding additional global surface warming by 2100 to less than 2.0 °C (3.6 °F)—a level considered by many scientists to be the threshold above which pervasive and extreme climatic effects will occur.

The greatest increase in near-surface air temperature is projected to occur over the polar region of the Northern Hemisphere because of the melting of sea ice and the associated reduction in surface albedo. Greater warming is predicted over land areas than over the ocean. Largely due to the delayed warming of the oceans and their greater specific heat, the Northern Hemisphere—with less than 40 percent of its surface area covered by water—is expected to warm faster than the Southern Hemisphere. Some of the regional variation in predicted warming is expected to arise from changes to wind patterns and ocean currents in response to surface warming. For example, the warming of the region of the North Atlantic Ocean just south of Greenland is expected to be slight. This anomaly is projected to arise from a weakening of warm northward ocean currents combined with a shift in the jet stream that will bring colder polar air masses to the region. projected changes in mean surface temperatures Projected changes in mean surface temperatures by the late 21st century according to the A1B climate change scenario. All values for the period 2090–99 are shown relative to the mean temperature values for the period 1980–99.

Learn how the Netherlands have combatted rising sea levels and flooding disasters with the Delta project See all videos for this article The climate changes associated with global warming are also projected to lead to changes in precipitation patterns across the globe. Increased precipitation is predicted in the polar and subpolar regions, whereas decreased precipitation is projected for the middle latitudes of both hemispheres as a result of the expected poleward shift in the jet streams. Whereas precipitation near the Equator is predicted to increase, it is thought that rainfall in the subtropics will decrease. Both phenomena are associated with a forecasted strengthening of the tropical Hadley cell pattern of atmospheric circulation. projected changes in mean precipitation Projected changes in mean precipitation by the late 21st century according to the A1B climate change scenario. All values for the period 2090–99 are shown as a percentage relative to the mean precipitation values for the period 1980–99. Changes in precipitation patterns are expected to increase the chances of both drought and flood conditions in many areas. Decreased summer precipitation in North America, Europe, and Africa, combined with greater rates of evaporation due to warming surface temperatures, is projected to lead to decreased soil moisture and drought in many regions. Furthermore, since anthropogenic climate change will likely lead to a more vigorous hydrologic cycle with greater rates of both evaporation and precipitation, there will be a greater probability for intense precipitation and flooding in many regions.

Regional predictions of future climate change remain limited by uncertainties in how the precise patterns of atmospheric winds and ocean currents will vary with increased surface warming. For example, some uncertainty remains in how the frequency and magnitude of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events will adjust to climate change. Since ENSO is one of the most prominent sources of interannual variations in regional patterns of precipitation and temperature, any uncertainty in how it will change implies a corresponding uncertainty in certain regional patterns of climate change. For example, increased El Niño activity would likely lead to more winter precipitation in some regions, such as the desert southwest of the United States. This might offset the drought predicted for those regions, but at the same time it might lead to less precipitation in other regions. Rising winter precipitation in the desert southwest of the United States might exacerbate drought conditions in locations as far away as South Africa.",mainstream,M0c936,climate.change; global.warming

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030, under an ambitious measure outlined Wednesday as the coastal state grapples with increasing concerns about sea-level rise.

The legislation sponsored by Sen. Paul Pinsky and Del. Dana Stein would increase the state’s current goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, based on 2006 levels. The measure also would set the state on a path toward achieving net-zero statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 2045.

Supporters of the “Climate Solutions Act of 2020” say Maryland, which has about 3,100 miles (5,000 kilometers)of tidal shorelinemust be a leader in addressing rising sea levels that threaten the state.

“We have to lead by example,” Pinsky, a Prince George’s County Democrat, said. “We have to show the rest of the state and the country we’re doing something about it.”

Environmentalists say the measure is the the most comprehensive approach to addressing greenhouse gas emissions before lawmakers this session in a legislature controlled by Democrats.

Themeasure’s goals includeplanting 1 million trees a year in the state for a decade. It also calls for requiring new commercial buildings with 25,000 square feet of rooftop to use solar panels.

The measure has powerful supporters in the General Assembly, including Senate President Bill Ferguson, though Pinsky conceded there could be some changes due to cost, and the goal for tree plantings “could be trimmed down.”

“There are going to be some amendments,” Pinsky said. “There are going to be some costs we’ll have to bring down.”

The state’s vehicle and bus fleet would become electric vehicles by 2030, under the measure, and a state program would be expanded to increase energy efficiency.

The measure also would create a work group focused on identifying communities affected most by climate change.

“There’s a lot more that our state could be doing to benefit the communities that are hardest hit,” said Sen. Mary Washington, a Democrat from Baltimore, where flooding and heatwaves are rising concerns.

Kallan Benson, a 16-year-old Crownsville, Maryland, resident who has been a climate activist since she was 9-years-old, said she used to be the youngest person in the room calling for action address climate change. Now, she says she’s increasingly seeing people younger than her at rallies and events seeking change.

“I’m here because I believe this bill will put us on a path to having a livable future,” Benson said.

Pinsky has criticized a draft plan released by Gov. Larry Hogan’s administration, saying it contains vague steps to reach the previously set goal of a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas. He contends the administration is not going far enough.

“They’ve relied on low-hanging fruit, easy things,” Pinsky, who chairs a committee that handles environmental legislation, said. “They have not been willing to take on the tough battles, and that’s what we’re doing here today with the Climate Solutions Act of 2020.”

But Ben Grumbles, the secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment, said the Republican governor supports getting the state to using 100% clean electricity by 2040.

“There’s far more common ground then what one is led to believe,” Grumbles said. “On the low-hanging fruit argument, we are focused on harvesting all the fruit wherever it is: low-hanging, high-hanging, as well as planting additional seeds for additional fruits in the coming years.”

Grumbles described the draft plan as “bold and balanced,” reaching an estimated 44% reduction goal by 2030.

“We are very open to working with legislators to continue to look for real and achievable and ambitious strategies,” Grumbles said.",mainstream,M0dc0d,climate.change

638,"Study Reviews Generic Laws as Set by States and Finds Less Restrictive Regulations Could Result in Savings of More than $100 Million

WOONSOCKET, R.I., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- States struggling to pay for increasing health care costs through their Medicaid programs can save more than $100 million over the next several years by changing generic substitution laws to permit easier and faster substitutions of generics for brand medications, a new CVS Caremark (NYSE: CVS) has found.

The study, published in the July edition of Health Affairs, looked at the generic substitution of simvastatin for cholesterol brand drug Zocor over six quarters beginning June 23, 2006, when Zocor's patent expired. The review looked at how quickly Medicaid recipients moved to the generic equivalent medications under three different state statutes – mandatory versus permissive substitution, with and without prior authorization, and with and without requiring patient approval for substitution. The generic substitutions discussed in the study are for chemically identical generics for brand name drugs.

""Requiring patients to provide consent prior to generic substitution led to an approximately 25% reduction in generic substitution,"" said Dr. William H. Shrank, the study's lead author, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. During the six consecutive quarters reviewed, the study determined that states could have saved almost $20 million if the substitution from Zocor to the chemically-identical simvatstatin were made more quickly for that one medication.

""This study has important implications. We determined states can stem the rising cost of medications paid for by Medicaid programs by modifying statutes to make it easier to replace brand name medications with generics,"" said Troyen A. Brennen, MD, MPH and Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of CVS Caremark. ""There are many brand medications that will lose their patent protection over the next several years and, as a consequence, we will see the introduction of generic equivalents for these brand medications. In particular, we can expect significant activity with the upcoming patent expirations of Lipitor, Plavix and Zyprexa over the next eighteen months.

""The study estimates state Medicaid programs can save more than $100 million on those three drugs alone by adopting regulations that allow pharmacists to make a change following the patent expiration, without requiring direct patient approval. This is action that policy makers can take immediately to save money without affecting the quality of pharmacy care,"" he said.

Brennan said cost containment and finding ways to better manage increasing health care costs is extremely important in the face of the current economic climate and expected expansion of state Medicaid programs resulting from federal health care reform. The study involved a review of Medicaid claims data between June 2006 and 2008 in 48 states and the District of Columbia.

The study published in Health Affairs is the result of CVS Caremark's previously announced three-year collaboration with Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital to research pharmacy claims data to better understand patient behavior around medication adherence and appropriate medication use. In addition, earlier this year the company launched a Behavior Change Research Partnership with academic leaders from Carnegie Mellon University, Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business and the University of Pennsylvania's Medical School and Wharton School of Business to develop insights into consumer actions around health challenges through the lens of behavioral economics and social marketing.

CVS Caremark is undertaking these studies because patient non-adherence to essential chronic medications is widely recognized as a barrier to improving public health and a cause of increasing medical costs. Past studies show one-quarter of people receiving prescriptions never fill their first prescription, and patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and coronary artery disease adhere to their ongoing medication regimen about half of the time. Non-adherence to essential medications is a frequent cause of preventable hospitalizations and patient illness, with costs to the U.S. health care system estimated at about $300 billion annually.

CVS Caremark is the largest pharmacy health care provider in the United States. Through our integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care, we are uniquely positioned to provide greater access, to engage plan members in behaviors that improve their health and to lower overall health care costs for health plans, plan sponsors and their members. CVS Caremark is a market leader in mail order pharmacy, retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and retail clinics, and is a leading provider of Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans. As one of the country's largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), we provide access to a network of more than 64,000 pharmacies, including approximately 7,000 CVS/pharmacy® stores that provide unparalleled service and capabilities.

163,"Inequality between countries has decreased over the past few decades. But between 1961 and 2010, the country-to-country gap would have narrowed more if not for climate change, says new research published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The difference between the richest and poorest countries in the world is some 25 percent wider than it would be in a world without global warming, the authors say.

Until now, we didn't have a number that showed “how much the global warming that's already happened has impacted the growth of existing countries, and the harm that’s already occurred,"" says Noah Diffenbaugh, an author of the study and a climate scientist at Stanford University. And critically, he says, “The countries that are most responsible for global warming are different from the countries that are bearing the brunt of global warming.”

Economists, development experts, and world leaders have long warned that climate change is likely to hurt poor countries more than rich ones. Recovering from disasters like hurricanes or floods or drought is more challenging when resources are thin, and extra heat hurts more when humans and crops are already near their limits— the case for many countries in the climate-sensitive tropics.

 

 “So even without this added economic penalty, those poorer places would bear the brunt of climate change,” says Amir Jina, an environmental policy expert at the University of Chicago.

 

 Much of the research on the social and economic impacts of climate change looked into the future, years or decades or centuries ahead. But in recent years, scientists have begun to tease out exact calculations of how much climate change has already affected us. In 2017, for example, they established that Hurricane Harvey dumped about 15 percent more rain than it would have in an un-climate-changed world.

 

 Diffenbaugh and Marshall Burke, the authors of the new study, realized they could apply the same kind of approach to economies. Burke and colleagues had shown a few years prior that there is a remarkable relationship between the average annual temperature in a country and its economic output. Places whose temperature hovered around 13 degrees Celsius, or about 55 degrees Fahrenheit (like China and the U.S.), have the highest economic productivity in the world. The farther away from that peak a country was, the less productive they were.

 

 It didn't matter if a country was rich or poor: The Goldilocks-esque relationship held. Colder countries didn't produce as much. Nor did hotter countries, and their economic penalty was even greater, especially when average temperatures crept above 20 degrees Celsius, or 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

The exact reasons why this relationship existed are still being worked out, and there’s no one factor that controls the effect globally. In some cases, hotter temperatures may make it harder for people to work, and in others, it may affect the agricultural output, amongst many other effects. But the overall pattern is clear.

 

 And it suggested an obvious next question: As the climate warmed over the past decades, had colder countries benefited economically? And were hotter countries paying a penalty? How much of the stubborn inequality between countries can be ascribed to climate change?

Who’s fault is climate change? And who pays the price?

Globally, economic inequality—the difference between the poorest countries and the richest countries—has narrowed over past decades (by one measure, it dropped by about 15 percent between 1975 and 2010). But what Diffenbaugh and Burke found was that between 1961 to 2010, that gap would have narrowed by about 25 percent more, had global warming not been a factor.

The penalty was particularly acute for tropical countries, which were already on the hotter end of the spectrum and far more sensitive to increases in heat. But the researchers also found something else in the data: Many of the countries in the temperate Goldilocks zone, which already tended to be richer, had even seemed to gain some slight ineffable economic benefit from the warming. As temperatures in many of those countries crept up, so did their economic output.

The study looks only at the relationship between temperature and economic measures, but does not dig in to identify the underlying reasons they might be connected, cautions Solomon Hsiang, an expert in climate and development at the University of California, Berkeley. Without those direct links, and without thinking about how past warming could have impacts that play out on longer timescales (the authors primarily focused on immediate economic responses to temperature, within a year), it’s premature to say that any countries have benefited from climate change, he says. And in fact, there is growing evidence that climate change hurts all countries, both rich and poor—so the small advantages seen here are likely to dissipate.

In contrast, the 18 countries with the lowest CO2 emissions per person (less than 10 tons per person in total over the years between 1961 to 2010, or about as much as the average American blows through in about seven and a half months today), took economic hits of over 25 percent.

“We already knew that the countries most vulnerable to climate change did not contribute much to emissions that caused that same climate change,” says Celine Guivarch, a climate change and policy expert at CIRED, the International Research Center on Environment and Development, in Paris. “We now have the quantification of how much. That has profound implications for justice between countries going forward.”

Climate-vulnerable countries have stressed this point during international climate negotiations. During discussions preceding the Paris Climate Agreement, in 2015, Indian delegates pressed for “climate reparations” from the wealthy countries who were responsible for the bulk of the planet-warming CO2 emissions in the past. And a coalition of island nations, led by the Marshall Islands, fought hard to get the richer, less-threatened nations to aim to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, rather than the 2 degrees Celsius goal that had dominated the early part of the negotiations.

Climate change is likely to cost everyone, everywhere, especially as its effects ramp up, Diffenbaugh is careful to point out. And he stresses that their analysis doesn’t explicitly address the costs of disasters, adaptation and mitigation, and many other factors that could wipe out economic gains in the future.",mainstream,M11ea7,climate.change; global.warming
631,"Greta Thunberg has proclaimed that world leaders are “behaving like children” while delivering a speech at a climate change protest in Bristol.
• Read more: Read climate change activist Greta Thunberg’s incredible speech to the UN – in full

The teenage activist took to the stage yesterday (February 28) to address a crowd of 30,000 protesters at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate event.

She told the crowd made up of mostly made up of school-age children that world leaders were “behaving like children” so “it falls on us to be the adults in the room.”

“There will be a time when we will look back and ask ourselves what we did right now. How do we want to be remembered,” she said (via SKY News). “People are already suffering and dying from the consequences of the climate emergency and it will get worse.

“This emergency is being completely ignored by the politicians, the media and those in power. Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises from our elected officials.”

She added that “it should not be this way”, but the “uncomfortable truth” was being swept “under the rug” for “children to clean up.”

“Activism works, so I am telling you to act. We are being betrayed by those in power. They are failing us, but we will not back down. And if you feel threatened by that, then I have some very bad news for you: we will not be silenced because we are the change, and change is coming whether you like it or not,” she said, before thanking the crowd and telling them, “let’s march.”

Earlier explaining why she chose to visit Bristol, the activist said it was for “many different reasons.”

“The movement is very strong here and I had contact with people who were here,” she said, before adding that she hoped the event would be a “gathering of people standing together in solidarity.”

Last month, Greta Thunberg responded to Meat Loaf’s claims that she has been “brainwashed” into believing in climate change.

The hard rock veteran argued that the 17-year-old activist’s time would be better spent on something other than working to reverse climate change.",mainstream,M0c3d4,climate.change
354,"Year on year, the climate news only seems to get worse. Temperature records are broken, and broken again, the extent of polar ice melt exceeds expectations, while efforts to cut emissions lag behind targets. And 2019 was no exception.

Yet something else happened this year.

Dire warnings by the IPCC and other experts, images of blazing forests and news of mass biodiversity loss helped make 2019 a year of climate activism. Greta Thunberg's school strike went global, environmental protests stepped up a gear and people began talking not of climate change but a climate crisis and a climate emergency.

These were some of the defining climate events and images that made 2019 the year of climate consciousness.

Fires raged across the world throughout 2019, wiping out biodiversity and releasing the carbon stored in trees and plants. This was the year we saw the Amazon burn like never before and flames sweep the Arctic tundra.

Here are some of the most devastating wildfires that occurred in 2019.

In 2019, the average air temperatures in the Arctic were almost 2 degrees Celsius (3.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal. Temperatures in Greenland reached highs of over 17 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit) in June, causing rapid ice-sheet melting.

A photograph of huskies pulling sleds through ankle-deep meltwaters on a Greenland ice sheet powerfully illustrated this. It was taken by a Danish climatologist whose work in Greenland was made difficult and dangerous by the rapidly changing conditions.

This year, the summer melt was the second-lowest level ever recorded. The 13 lowest sea ice extents in the satellite record have all occurred in the last 13 years, according to the annual Arctic Report Card by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the United States.

And that has global repercussions.

The Arctic works as a giant freezer for the planet. Arctic snow and ice reflects the sun's energy back into space, cooling the entire planet. But as the ice retreats, a vicious cycle is set in motion. With less snow and ice on the water, more heat is absorbed by the ocean, which is further accelerating ice loss.

On top of this, the Arctic itself may now be contributing to climate change. The frozen ground of the Arctic, also known as permafrost, contains lots of carbon which is released when it starts to thaw. This carbon then turns into a greenhouse gas, which so far has been absorbed by plant life growing in the summer, but this year it has started escaping into the atmosphere.

Thawing Arctic permafrost could be releasing as much carbon as Japan.

Meanwhile, Arctic animals — like the polar bear — are losing habitat. This year, starving polar bears were snapped scavenging for food in a Russian village hundreds of miles from their natural habitat, making for a startling image of our impact on nature coming home.

Another polar bear video to go viral this year was of a young, emaciated animal that was washed up in a Russian village on a piece of ice, exhausted by its search for food.

Climate change isn't just threatening wild habitats. New research published this year shows that rising seas could affect three times more people by 2050 than previously thought. Some 150 million people are currently living on land that could be submerged by mid-century.

A quarter of the current population of Vietnam, for instance, live on land, such as Ho Chi Minh City, that will likely be inundated. In Thailand, that figure stands at more than 10% of the population. Cities like Mumbai, Shanghai and Bangkok could also be wiped out.

With all this bad news, it's perhaps no surprise that 2019 saw climate change loom larger than ever in public consciousness. And that awareness spurred unprecedented action.

On August 20, 2018 a lone teenage activist – Greta Thunberg – skipped school to demand the Swedish government act on climate change. A week later she was joined by fellow students, teachers and parents in Sweden.

By March 2019, the movement had exploded across the globe, with students in 135 countries demanding their governments take action and forcing adults to confront the deeply uncomfortable image of a generation of children in fear for their future.

Fridays for Future students were soon joined by Scientists for Future, Parents for Future and Teachers for Future. On September 20, the largest climate strike yet saw some 4 million people of all ages take to the streets in more than 150 countries.

Alongside Fridays for Future, the big name in climate activism this year was Extinction Rebellion.

The movement started in the United Kingdom in 2018 but like Fridays for Future, it went global in 2019 and now has groups in some 70 countries around the world.

Inspired by grassroots movements like Occupy and the non-violence of Gandhi and Rosa Parks, Extinction Rebellion is going one step further than waving banners and has turned to civil disobedience to drive their message home.

They have paralyzed traffic by blocking some of the busiest roads in major cities and unloaded a heap of horse manure in front of the Madrid climate talks. They've colored a local river in Zurich acid green, sprayed the British Treasury with gallons of fake blood and interrupted a Brexit debate with the buttocks of semi-naked protesters facing the chamber of the House of Commons.

What they are most known for, though, is their ""die-ins,"" where hundreds of people swarm public squares to collapse to the ground, symbolizing the deaths humanity faces if politicians don't do something, fast.

One of Extinction Rebellion's core demands is that governments declare a ""climate emergency."" Oxford Dictionary chose the phrase as Word of the Year 2019, defining the term as ""a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it.""

In 2018, it was on hardly anyone's radar but in 2019, the words were blazoned across banners by protestors and dropped into speeches by politicians, and in November, 11,000 scientists declared a global ""climate emergency.""

Hundreds of cities around the world, as well as the EU Parliament declared a climate emergency in 2019, admitting that measures taken thus far to prevent a climate disaster aren't enough and promising to make climate change policy a priority.

Still, declaring a climate emergency isn't legally binding. Some local councils are committing to specific targets — such as reaching net-zero emissions earlier than their national government plans to — others are more vague in their promise to make climate change policy a priority and see the move as sending a message to citizens and the rest of the world to inspire change from the bottom up.

And local and grassroots action may be more important than ever, after the disappointing outcome of this year's COP25 climate conference.

Governments were expected to collectively agree on a deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions more rapidly. Yet the concluding resolution only endorsed the ""urgent need"" to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the goals set at the 2015 Paris Agreement. Brazil, China, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the United States reportedly led resistance to bolder action.",mainstream,M08bc9,climate.change
762,"Climate change is expected to affect every country in the world, but its impact will not be felt equally across all regions and some will be worse hit than others because of a range of different threats.

Developing countries, places with widespread poverty, and countries with ineffective governments sometimes face the gravest risks from the changing climate, and are usually poorly equipped to find ways to prepare for and prevent environmental threats.

Measuring the future impact of climate change is very challenging, because scientists’ climate change projections cannot be completely exact and because there are many different factors that come into play such as the risk of extreme weather events and rising temperatures. There are other non-climatic factors that also determine how severely a city or country will be impacted by climate change. Niall Smith, who analyzes regions’ climate change vulnerability for the global risk consulting firm Maplecroft, tells TIME that it’s also necessary to weigh in what’s happening politically and socially in a region to figure out if the country can prepare.

“The places with the least level of economic development are certainly in line to feel the impacts with the greatest degree, partially just due to their geographic fate — or their location — but more so based on the socio-economic and governance factors,” says Smith.

Many developing countries are also uniquely vulnerable, says Kelly Levin of the World Resources Institute, “their livelihoods are dependent on natural resources. And if those natural resources are affected by climate change, their ability to feed their families and make a living is significantly impacted.”

To get a sense of the challenges different regions are facing, TIME spoke to experts about six countries and cities will be be particularly affected by climate change.

Lagos is at “extreme” risk on Maplecroft’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index. This is especially concerning because its population is expanding rapidly, and it is considered to be a major economic engine for the region.

The governor boasted that Lagos had reached a GDP of $136 billion in 2017, which is about a third of the entire country’s GDP. The city is also a major transportation hub, with multiple ports and a major international airport and is a regional hub for high tech industry. Lagos has “transformed” over the last 18 years, Lamido Sanusi, a former central bank governor, told the Financial last year In terms of roads, in terms of infrastructure, in terms of a general investment environment, in terms of security, the government has given people a greater opportunity to thrive.”

Lagos is also at a disadvantage because it’s considered to be one of the fastest growing cities in the world, which will put a “strain on infrastructure and resources,” according to Smith. Its population is projected to nearly double over the next 15 years, growing from its current population of 13,463,420 to 23,418,770.

In the future, Smith warns that Lagos residents will also experience more hot days and droughts.

Climate change could threaten the city’s economy. The city is especially vulnerable because it’s located on the Gulf of Guinea, says Levin. As sea levels rise, it’s likely to affect cause coastal erosion and contaminate potable water. This could harm local agriculture in the countryside and damage the country’s fishing industry, which could be dire in a country with “tremendous” poverty, Levin says.

“You could see more and more people moving in from the countryside because of loss of economic opportunity into a city like Lagos, which could make the whole situation more challenging,” Levin says.

If Lagos struggles, it could seriously reduce economic opportunity in the region.

Climate change can be a “threat multiplier,” says Christina Chan, the director of the World Resources Institute’s climate resilience practice. This is especially true for Haiti. The island nation is located in the “Atlantic Hurricane Basin,” which means that it is vulnerable to hurricanes. In comparison to other projections on climate change, scientists are less certain about the link between climate change and hurricane frequency and intensity, but studies have suggested that hurricanes are likely getting wetter and more intense due to climate change.

Since Haiti is a very poor country, recovering from natural disasters and preparing for future storms is especially challenging. The devastation in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and 2016’s Hurricane Matthew was compounded by the country’s lack of disaster preparedness. The disasters were major setbacks for the country’s economic development; the $8 billion price tag of recovering from the earthquake surpassed the country’s GDP, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

The landscape is also heavily deforested and mountainous, which means it will be more susceptible to landslides.

According to Levin, Haiti will also struggle because the population is dependent on agriculture, and rising sea levels mean that salt water may contaminate freshwater. The United Nations warns that rising sea levels may cause saltwater to permeate farmland and freshwater supplies.

“There’s certainly a large portion of Haitians that are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods and income. And if you have overall patterns of rainfall declines as temperatures rise, certainly that would impact farmers,” Levin says.

Countries with weak institutions and governments are likely to find it especially difficult to adapt to climate change, says Smith. Since civil war broke out in Yemen in 2015, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed directly as a result of the conflict, but also due to the subsequent famine, poor sanitation and a lack of clean water, according to the United Nations. About 1.6 million children in Yemen are living with malnutrition in 2019, according to the UN.

Both war and climate change will make water shortages and famine more likely. According to a Untied Nations report, most contemporary famines result from armed conflict and are worsened by natural disasters.

As the report explains, “Parties to the conflict may use food as a weapon, cutting off food supplies, destroying systems of food production and distribution, and stealing food aid. Agricultural production falls, which both limits the availability of food and cuts off many rural houses from their livelihoods. And with higher levels of poverty, many families cannot afford the food they need, especially at inflated prices.”

Malaria is also becoming more common in Yemen, and may be exacerbated by rising temperatures. As Yemen has a long coast, it’s also vulnerable to rising sea levels, according to Levin.

An area to watch, says Levin, “Whenever you’re thinking about a country in that region… [is] the issue of rising temperatures impacting water scarcity, especially when it’s exacerbated by water management challenges and expanding population.”

As other countries work to curb their oil consumption, it may be a mixed blessing for Yemen, according to Levin. While lower emissions are believed to be necessary to limit climate change, it could also reduce demands for one of Yemen’s major imports — oil — which could impact Yemen’s economy, Levin says.

The Philippines faces a high risk of natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, and especially hurricanes. Manila, which is located along the coast, is also densely populated, which makes it more difficult to evacuate, requires more social services and makes it more challenging to rebuild after a disaster. Poor infrastructure, including ineffective drainage and sanitation systems, has been blamed for the toll of floods in the city, including a 2009 flood that submerged 80% of the city.

However, Chan says that the Philippines is in fact on the “forefront of adaptation” to climate change, and have designated part of their budget to making their country’s agricultural sector and infrastructure more resilient, and preparing to respond to future disasters. For instance, the government launched a Flood Management Master Plan for Metro Manila in 2012, which aims to manage future floods by modernizing and building new pumping stations and investing in other infrastructure along waterways, according to the Asian Infrastructure investment Bank.

The Philippines have created a Climate Change Commission, which implements programs such as the National Climate Change Action Plan, a long-term strategy for prioritizing “food security, water sufficiency, ecosystem and environmental stability, human security, climate smart industries and services, sustainable energy, knowledge and capacity development.”

Rising sea levels mean that Kiribati may be wiped off the map entirely in the coming decades. The islands have even purchased 5,000 acres of land in Fiji in case they need to relocate.

While Kitribati, like many other countries, is taking steps to prepare for climate change, the Pacific island nation must also reckon with the fact that “for their island, adaptation will have its limits,” says Chan. The islands are only six feet above sea level and sit upon a system of atolls and reef islands, which means that rising sea levels are a threat to the nation’s existence.

This vulnerability has also spurred Kiribati to take serious steps in climate mitigation. Kiribati has allied itself with other vulnerable island countries to advocate for action to fight climate change, and taken other measures such as planting mangrove trees and building sea walls.

Meanwhile, Levin says, rising sea levels are likely to contaminate the island’s freshwater and harm its soil, which is not especially fertile for agriculture to begin with. The island’s vital fishing industry is also more vulnerable, as climate changes leads to shifts in the ocean, including coral bleaching; damage to the structure of reefs; marine “heat waves”; and other conditions that force marine life to move north.

Like many of the other places on this list, the United Arab Emirates is facing many risks due to its location. Like Yemen and other neighboring states, the UAE is facing an “extreme risk” of water stress, according to Smith, and will need to spend a lot more energy on cooling.

Unlike many other countries facing these threats, however, the UAE is wealthier and is able to make sophisticated investments to blunt the impact of climate change. For instance, the UAE is working to produce its own fresh water, build temperature-controlled spaces, investments in green energy, and developing crops that can withstand hotter temperatures.

However, according to Levin, it remains to be seen whether these adaptations will reach Yemen’s entire population, because the country faces rampant inequality.

“The question is, will adequate investments be made in time, and will the poorest be able to enjoy the same kind of comforts as the rest of the population,” Levin says. “You can look at the face of a GDP of a given country. But that really masks tremendous inequality. It’s hard to necessarily say that one country’s in such a better position to withstand climate impacts.”",mainstream,M0f102,climate.change; global.warming

Shock Waves Echo Across World After Catastrophic Polling Blunder Fails To Spot Trump Forces “Miracle Win” In

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

A rather jubilant new Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) report circulating in the Kremlin today celebrating the “miracle election victory” of Christian evangelical Prime Minister Scott Morrison to lead the southern Pacific Ocean continent nation Commonwealth of Australia comes fittingly on a weekend that sees our last Blue Moon appearance for this decade—that revives the idiom “once in a blue moon” used to describe rare events—of which this one has “sent shockwaves echoing across the world” after this nation became the latest to succumb to President Donald Trump’s populist wave sweeping the globe—that, in turn, has Americans hailing “The Trump Effect”—while at the same time, they’re laughing at the ”catastrophic blunder of pollsters” who didn’t even see this shocking election victory coming straight at them. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

…while Australian leftists (above, on 19 May 2019) collapse in tears like Hillary Clinton supporters did when she lost to Trump.

According to this report, with President Trump’s populist wave having captured every nation it has rolled over—the last two being Italy and Brazil, which means that “populists have now wrested control of the world economy away from the globalists”—panic stricken leftists within the elite Western power structure built what they believed was an impenetrable wall to protect themselves during this Blue Moon weekend’s Australian national election—the bricks of which were every socialist policy one could imagine them coming up with, and that ranged from promises to tax the rich to death and redistribute their wealth, to enacting draconian climate change laws to save the world from being destroyed in 2030—or 2040—or 2050—or whatever date they’ve finally decided on, but have yet to tell anyone about.

Australian socialists in (above) march to celebrate their pending election victory on 17 May 2019

In the days and hours leading up the 18 May 2019 national election in Australia, this report continues, all of the opinion polls, mass media critics and bookmakers declared, without any doubt whatsoever, that all of the signs pointed towards a “sweeping win” for these socialists—but none of whom, apparently, had factored into “their signs” the devout Christian Prime Minister Scott Morrison having declared that he “believed in miracles”—and because of, saw him scoring a stunning surprise victory that was propelled by a populist wave—the “quiet Australians”, he termed them—the counterpart force against socialism that has upended politics in the United States, Britain and beyond—and whose leader President Trump called Prime Minister Morrison immediately after this shocking historic election victory to congratulate him, and further had his White House release a statement stating: “The two leaders reaffirmed the critical importance of the longstanding alliance and friendship between the United States and Australia, and they pledged to continue their close cooperation on shared priorities”.

With the Australian people having awoken this Sunday morning to the aftermath of their nation’s socialist forces having “lost the unloseable election”, this report notes, their beyond shocked and stunned leftist elite class have predictably begun lashing out—best exampled by former leftist Prime Minister John Howard slamming these socialists’ approach to the election as the “politics of envy” that divided Australia on class—Griffith University in Queensland leftist law professor Susan Harris-Rimmer lamenting that “I think we’re just getting used to the politics of the absurd… it’s been a long time since politics was normal anywhere”—and radical leftist British climate activist professor Stephan Lewandowsky fearfully telling his socialist comrades “we have lost Australia for now”.

Not being noticed, understood or considered by these leftists, this report explains, is that Australia was neither “lost” to anyone nor were its citizens participating in “the politics of the absurd”—as all of them, in fact, are required under penalty of law (A$20 fine for failure to vote) to participate in their elections—and is a system that requires voters to nominate multiple candidates which means that insurgent third-party campaigns have little purchase, because people can have their protest vote and still choose a mainstream candidate too—which is a preferential voting system where minor-party votes get redistributed to the leading candidates in the House of Representatives elections, resulting in so-called “two-party preferred” that should always sum to 100%--but whose stunning polling predictive failure was driven in part by the decline of landline telephones making pollsters’ task in finding a representative sample of voters “all but impossible”—and is an issue that’s occurring across the world—thus causing polling organizations to benchmark against each other in a way that’s led to “herding”, that produces overconfidence around what’s turned out to be an utterly erroneous result.

Most inexplicable, though, this report concludes, are why these socialist Western pollsters continue using the same failed predictive methods which catastrophically blew up in their faces when they tried and failed to predict the Brexit vote, failed to predict every single election in the world afterwards, and whose predictive failures now include Australia—one of whose most expensive consequences of fell upon the Sportsbet bookies in Australia who made an early payout of $1.3 million before yesterday’s election to those who bet on a socialist victory, because the polls said they couldn’t lose—an early payout, however, that collided with a “miracle victory” that wasn’t supposed to happen causing these bookies to lose all of their money—the humor of which they took in stride by hilariously posting “this didn't age well”—and was also, beyond all doubt, relished by a President Trump who beat and smashed these socialist pollsters’ predictions in 2016—and is preparing to do so once again in 2020.

101,"""Climate change and sustainability were not easy topics back then,"" remembers Hanno Franke, thinking back almost 25 years and almost sounding as if he’s trying to defend himself.

The SC Freiburg marketing director has been at the club since the mid-1990s, a time when the Sport-Club from the Black Forest became the first Bundesliga club to begin taking measures to protect the environment.

""The club wasn’t sure of its own identity, its own DNA,"" Franke explains. ""But even then, the city of Freiburg took sustainability very seriously so it seemed logical that we as a football club should get involved as well. Many people advised us against it. Back then, some of our advisers warned us about being 'too green.'""

One of the main ideas was the installation of solar panels on the roof of the Schwarzwaldstadion’s new south stand (pictured above). It's common measure by today's standards, with many Bundesliga clubs producing their own solar energy, but in the mid-1990s, Freiburg were ahead of the curve and faced stiff opposition.

""Looking back, the club showed a great deal of courage and conviction and laid the groundwork for everything that followed,"" says Franke, with barely concealable pride.

Today, all Bundesliga clubs are aware of their environmental responsibilities, which can be divided into four main areas: traffic and emissions, waste, water and energy. But it's taken some clubs longer than others, with some only becoming ""greener"" when environmentally friendly measures also allowed them to save money.

""For a long time, environmental protection didn't play a role in football at all,"" says Thomas Fischer of the Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), a German environmental and consumer-protection agency that carries out regular surveys of Bundesliga clubs. ""But those days are over.""

However, Fischer still thinks more can be done.

""Clubs are great at implementing green policies when they don't require any investment in infrastructure, such as using green energy or installing LED lights which save energy.""

In recent years, clubs have begun to expand their climate protection portfolios more or less off their own backs, or in cooperation with local businesses. In March 2019, the 36 professional clubs in Germany’s top three leagues came together to discuss environmental solutions, but there is still no central coordination through the German Football League (DFL).

""The Bundesliga is still lacking a general climate plan,"" laments Fischer, who would like to see clubs pool their activities for climate protection. ""The DFL needs to set environmental targets and provide instructions and guidelines to help clubs implement concrete measures."" No such guidelines currently exist and the DFL is yet to respond to questions sent by DW.

In some areas, clubs are already implementing a number of measures to help protect the environment. They reduce waste by separating materials and serving drinks in recyclable cups, they save energy by installing solar panels or using LED lighting and they save water by gathering rain water for pitch irrigation and providing water-saving toilet facilities. But emissions created by travel to and from the matches remain a problem.

According to a study conducted by the climate advisory agency C02OL on behalf of German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk, football fans produce around 7,800 tons of harmful emissions per matchday. It would take 60,000 newly planted trees to compensate for that amount of C02, or over two million per season, and that's before flights to further-flung away games are taken into consideration.

In the north of Germany, Bundesliga side Werder Bremen are setting an example with an ""anti-automobile"" traffic concept. ""In Bremen, fans can travel to the stadium on a ferry along the River Weser,"" explains Fischer. ""What's more, cars are banned from approaching the stadium or from parking there.""

This reduces the amount of C02 being released into the air around the stadium. Fischer is still critical however of clubs such as Mainz and Hoffenheim who bill themselves as being ""carbon neutral.""

""Ultimately, they achieve this by buying climate certificates,"" opines Fischer. “It’s not too far away from the selling of indulgences."" In Hoffenheim's defense, the club compensates for its C02 emissions by running a reforestation program in Uganda in central Africa. ""But that doesn’t solve any waste or emissions problems in Hoffenheim itself,"" criticizes Fischer.

Back in Freiburg, the local club is dealing with local problems. SC Freiburg cooperate with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) on nature-protection projects in the Black Forest, the woodland which dominates the region. The project involves regularly educating local children and teenagers about climate change and how they can live more environmentally friendly lives.

Club employees are trained as well. Even when, after 25 years of experience, Freiburg are considered an ""industry leader"" in environmentally friendly football, there is still much to learn and the club remains open to new ideas.

""More and more organizations and campaigns are getting in touch with us because of our reputation which we have built up since the 1990s,"" says Hanno Frenke, who is particularly pleased about the number of young people who approach the club with their own questions and feedback.

""We had the organizers of the Freiburg branch of 'Fridays for Future' for a visit, for instance,"" he says. ""And of course we supported them – out of conviction.""",mainstream,M0c2bf,climate.change
198,"The year 2017 was a record-breaking year for extreme weather and environmental catastrophes since records started to be kept in the 19th century. The Arctic experienced temperatures up to 70 degree F above normal. Many countries were baked in unusual heatwaves killing thousands. Incidents of droughts, extreme typhoons in the Pacific and hurricanes in the Atlantic, flash floods, and wildfires erupted daily in international news headlines. As recent as 2014, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), following an analysis of NASA satellite footage of carbon dioxide movement around the planet, concluded that our warming planet has entered “unchartered territory at frightening speed.” But 2017 was also the year when the statistical figures came in for 2016.

The WMO reported that CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere rose at record speed. Currently it is at its highest level in 800,000 years. If anyone held any doubt that climate change is unreal, a fiction or fantasy, 2017 should have been wake up call to the most obstinate denialist. Scientists have warned about our current days of climate for several decades. For those who jumped on the bandwagon years ago when atmospheric and geological scientists voiced serious concerns about global warming and its dire consequences, it was a year with no huge surprises, except for the rapid acceleration of warming trends.

It is time that people, and more crucially our entire species, to accept the fact that climate change is the single most important threat to humanity’s survival. Certainly, a nuclear confrontation with North Korea or Russia is a horrifying scenario that could eliminate tens or even hundreds of millions of people. However, it is within humanity’s means to avoid nuclear war.

On the other hand it is highly improbable whether we can do much to deter climate change. Natural forces are far beyond our technological know-how and methods to control powerful planetary forces regardless of how many efforts to advance geoengineering or a dramatic shift to renewable energies are made. Perhaps it will slow the pace of global warming a little, but it too has its own destructive blowback. The Earth’s history is a long story of numerous species birthing, evolving and eventually going extinct. There is no manifest destiny for our species. There is no divine promise that humanity may not in the future follow in the footsteps of the dinosaurs. Our lives are not transcendent to Nature nor the multitude of other natural forces, animals, plants, microbes and other life forms and molecules upon which our existence depends. This is a simple truth we must learn. And it must be learned quickly and without further delay.

In a July issue of New York Magazine, journalist David Wallace-Wells published a worst case, doomsday scenario of climate change’s impact upon human society and the environment before the end of this century. His essay, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” was based upon many private interviews with unnamed scientists who were willing to voice their deeper concerns about catastrophic events and eroding conditions humanity will face unless a concerted global response to reduce greenhouse gases is not launched immediately. Aside from several of Wallace-Wells’ factual errors, this was the first featured article to appear in a mainstream publication that focused on climate change’s darker side. It became the most read article in New York Magazine‘s history. However, earlier in 2003, Cambridge University astrophysicist and philosopher Martin Rees released his influential Our Final Hour warning that the pace of humanity’s destructive activities presents a 50:50 chance for our civilization to survive past the end of the 21st century. Carcinogenic and unhealthy foods and high levels of deadly toxic chemicals in common everyday products are only minor risks compared to many other postmodern technologies impacting our lives. Climate change, combined with the genetic engineering of new viruses, synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, and rape of the planet for its last remaining natural resources, according to Rees, is a recipe for certain disaster and will likely end in the extinction of our species. While many scientists and most of the general public who acknowledge the facts about anthropogenic climate change continue to hold enormous blind faith on human ingenuity and modern technology to prevent global warming’s “end game,” Rees and a distinguished, multi-disciplinary consortium of scientists at the Cambridge Center for the Study of Existential Risks acknowledge a darker side behind our over-reliance upon technological solutions–nuclear power, geoengineering, genetic manipulation of nature, etc.

Rees’s 50:50 survival prediction was largely ignored after its publication over a decade ago. Nobody wants to accept that our survival is predicated upon a flip of a coin. Today, his predictions are being reevaluated and his supporters are increasing. And this is why Wallace-Wells’ New York Magazine‘s article is so important. There are more than ample reasons to fear the consequences of climate change on our health, food security, our livelihoods, well-being, and the survival of future generations, including our children. Extinction is forever, whether it be in a hundred, as the more pessimistic scientists suggest, or a thousand years or more. It is only a matter of time before killer heat waves become the norm, chemical-based industrial agriculture collapses, national economies are devastated, new plagues and health epidemics emerge, and climate and resource conflicts and wars increase.

All of these have been previously predicted over the years, and each is already starting to cast its shadow over the planet. Fear combined with hope is a powerful motivating factor to embrace change in personal habits and lifestyle. Therefore, it is critical today for humanity to become afraid, to become intensely afraid without becoming paralyzed. We condemn ourselves only by our failure to wake up while clinging to faux optimism, and by refusing to take upon ourselves the appropriate actions when confronted with an immediate emergency.

Climate change science poses certain obstacles difficult for the average person to accept. Perhaps most evident is that the science and predictions appear too abstract. They can seem too foreign and impersonal. The calving of an enormous ice sheet in Antarctica or rapid Himalayan glacier melt do not set off alarm bells that threaten our cozy lives in American and European cities and suburbs. The events are too distant. We know that sea levels are rising. Everyone in Miami is aware of this fact because flooded areas in the city are now commonplace. The citizens of the Maldives and Solomon Islands certainly know this because their nations are already sinking under rising sea levels. But to imagine one’s home or condominium along the coast being partially submerged permanently in the Atlantic Ocean is a time too far off to think about. Consequently, real estate developers continue their frenzy to build more residences up and down the Florida coast, and people continue to flock to the Sunshine State to purchase a sunny place to retire. It is almost obscene to imagine that four of the top ten cities witnessing the largest influx of migrants within the United States are also the most compromised by more immediate climate change and extreme weather conditions: Houston (No. 1), Miami (No. 2), Phoenix (No. 7) and Orlando (No. 10). In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey submerged over 100,000 homes throughout the greater Houston metropolitan area. While the storm itself cannot be attributed to humanity’s contribution to global warming, the hurricane’s intensity and power is certainly related. Rising sea levels and warmer sea surface off the Texas coast — 7.2 degrees F above average making it the hottest spot of ocean surface in the world — are the two major factors that made Harvey so catastrophic and deadly. And similar extreme tropic storms are only going to increase as the Earth gets warmer. As the planet’s surface heats further and sea levels rise, climatic events become increasingly more extreme. Consequently our lives become more stressed, miserable, insecure and uncertain.

Individually, nobody can initiate the kind of grand massive change in collective humanity’s relationship to the environment being demanded today. However, each of us can make determined and immediate changes in our personal lives and repair our personal rapport with the earth, nature, the ecology around our homes, neighborhoods and towns. No honor is gained by sitting and waiting for government to take concerted action to lessen greenhouse gas emissions and overhaul the federal regulatory system to hold private industries and polluters accountable. The corruption of Washington is beyond reform because government has itself become a private enterprise. Likewise, Americans are waking up to the realization that their votes are useless. Those who need to change the most–elected officials and legislators, corporate CEOs and Chairmen, professional institutions– will not find the solutions until it is too late. In the meantime, they refuse to see the problem. And this is clearly evident by the fact that the fossil fuel industry is expanding rather than receding.

This chapter will lay out the fundamental problem humanity faces as climate change and global warming accelerate. Although a popular awareness of climate change is growing rapidly, most people still have difficulty connecting the dots between dramatic climate-related crises and calamities happening in far off regions of the planet and the impact these very same events have upon their personal lives. Therefore, I will be presenting the climate science in simple lay language, providing crucial examples, in order to make global warming a more personal affair. Unless the threats the Earth faces are understood and perceived as a threat to our personal well-being and that of our immediate families, loved ones and friends, the constructive, necessary change so direly needed will not unfold. Nevertheless, we must begin with ourselves because each of us possesses in her or his power the capacity to live in harmony with life and the greater whole of Nature. And then we must serve as an example of a conscientious, ecological lifestyle to those we meet.

In August 2017, the 900-plus foot tanker Christophe de Margerie set sail from Russia’s North Sea to South Korea. The cruise’s novelty was that for the first time in recorded history a sailing vessel crossed the Arctic’s Northern Sea Route without the need for icebreakers. The ship traveled freely, unencumbered across the broken, melting ice fields. This small incident regarding a tanker carrying natural gas half way around the world may seem incidental and insignificant, barely newsworthy. But for climatologists and Arctic ecologists it was an unexpected and disturbing event. It was another indication that the planet is racing faster towards an ice free Arctic. It was also a warning that global warming is accelerating beyond expectations. Back in 2013, the University of California was predicting that ships would be incapable of traveling freely across the North Pole before 2050. However, the Christophe’s passage over the Arctic’s southern frontier in under seven days holds a record. And this voyage would have never been possible without the acceleration of anthropogenic climate change.

As the Russian vessel made its way across the crown of the planet, at the opposite pole another surprising event occurred. On July 12, 2017, an iceberg, approximately 2,200 square miles or roughly the size of the state of Delaware, broke free from the Larsen C icesheet in Western Antarctica. This was the third gigantic Antarctic icesheet to collapse since 1995, and the largest to date. Glaciologists were startled because the speed of the sheet’s disintegration was miscalculated. Although the break, commonly known as “calving,” had been predicted several years prior, it was the suddenness that was disturbing. A week later, glaciologists’ predictions were proven wrong a second time. It had not been a clean split as calculated earlier. Instead, like a stone hitting an auto’s windshield, the break triggered a network of fissures indicating that the entire icesheet was quickly fragmenting and more sheets would be calving in the near future. Antarctica is often viewed as the last place on Earth that will be touched by global warming due to human activity. However, 2016 observed a record low of sea ice, according to the University of Washington, and 2020 is now targeted as the turnaround point when the degradation of the southern polar icesheets will be directly the result of human activity. Already, atmospheric temperatures in the Antarctic have been rising annually by 4-6 C. As warming seasons lengthen, ice sheets melt and calf faster and eventually the shelves thin further and disappear.

For the twenty-first century, these two geological events, and many others, are indicative of the greatest threat to humanity: global warming and climate change. For the first time in human history, our species has entered an era of extraordinary and anxious uncertainty. Many are bewildered when they hear about the loss of an Antarctic ice sheet, prolonged droughts, temperatures reaching above 50 degree Celsius, flash floods, and uncontrollable wildfires. What does it mean when we hear that 2016 was the third year in a row to set a new record for average global temperatures? Is this simply a fluke? An aberration in the usual climate patterns we have become accustomed to? Will it continue or end?

The international scientific community is nearly unanimous in confirming that global warming is accelerating and human activity is its primary driving force. There is also near unanimous certainty the course we are following to reach catastrophic benchmarks is inevitable and completely outside our civilization’s control. Those scientists who resist the international consensus are far and few between. The majority of dissenters lack a professional background in the Earth and Space sciences, climatology, glaciology and other disciplines directly associated with measuring and observing changes in the atmosphere and the Earth’s geology. For several decades, scientists the world over have been running simulated climate models repeatedly to determine whether increased warming is anthropogenic or caused by human activity. And repeatedly whenever human-generated greenhouse gases–CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, dust, etc.– are removed from their equations, they are unable to account for the sudden rise in the Earth’s temperature as the result of natural phenomena alone. Already the Earth is warmer than it has been for the last 120,000 years. However, when these same models introduce greenhouse gases into their equations, they accurately correlate with the actual temperature trends being witnessed. Long-term, 90% of planetary warming is linked to the actions of our species. The remaining 10%, according to Konrad Steffen, director of the Swiss Polar Institute, is “unexplained.

It is not uncommon for climatologists to underestimate the swiftness of climate-related events. The statistical and computational models to portend timelines for certain climate tipping points, although highly sophisticated, are unable to account for all variables and trends, particularly unforeseeable catastrophes such as mammoth biomass emissions from wildfires and other natural and human calamities. For example, researchers would not predictable calculate the explosion of BP’s Deep Horizon facility that discharged up to 520,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere, the equivalent of burning upwards to 3.1 million barrels of crude oil. Consequently dire findings are either found wanting or too sober as new observations upgrade earlier forecasts. Very soon the Arctic region will be ice free throughout the year. Conservatively the Arctic will lose all its ice during the warmest months before 2030. We still don’t know precisely many of the long-term consequences to the polar region and the planet’s biosystems once this tipping point is reached. However, there are approximately four million people living along the Arctic Circle, including hundreds of thousands of indigenous people. Very likely, most of the coastal communities will be forced to migrate in the near future as shorelines dependent upon ice, freezing temperatures and colder seasons start to crumble and disappear. Acceleration is also exasperated by the thawing permafrost and tundra, and the massive release of methane and nitrous oxide, in the Arctic North. In point of fact, the polar North is collapsing.

The loss of the Arctic’s albedo, the white world of ice that reflects the Sun’s radiation back into space, has already passed its tipping point. For as long as humans have been on the third planet from the Sun, we will never return to a time when polar bears and seals thrived on frozen ocean surfaces. We can no longer prevent the Western Antarctic icesheets, including the Larsen and Ross sheets, from slipping away into the dark oceanic waters. The rush of fresh water from melting glaciers in Greenland are beyond our technological means to prevent the disruption in the Atlantic Ocean’s conveyor belt. Based upon satellite data feeds, the Greenland sheets, according to David Barber at the University of Manitoba, are now melting six hundred times faster than the current modeling trends suggest.

Similarly, due to many complex and unknown factors, it is exceedingly difficult to ascertain exactly how high the oceans will rise if all Antarctic ice melts. For example, one of the largest Antarctic icesheets rests on solid ground below sea level. On the one hand, this makes the sheet far more unstable and geologists continue to try to determine its global impact following its last breath. Nevertheless the loss of the Ross icesheet in West Antarctica alone could raise sea levels 10-13 feet (3-4 meters). In 2014, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the University of California at Irvine determined that the loss of the West Antarctic sheet is unstoppable. The circulation of the ocean’s warmer waters beneath the ice continues to thin and melt the shelf. No technology nor even a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can prevent it. As if a warhead missile had already been launched, we can only sit and wait to experience the consequences befalling us upon impact.

For many years, scientists were not terribly concerned about a rapid melt of Antarctic icesheets. The southern pole has always been thought to be the last place on earth to experience global warming. For the past 40 years, winter ice has actually increased–until recently. In 2016, University of Washington researchers noted a perfect storm of conditions that, if repeated annually, will increase Antarctic ice melts and possibly trend towards declining ice buildup during the winter months. One of the causes the university scientists identified was a change in El Nino patterns that are now reaching the Antarctic.

In May 2014, Climate Central provided a probable scenario of American land lost due to a 10 foot increase in sea levels. Approximately 28,800 square miles of land mass would disappear with rising waters and force the dislocation of over 12 million people, primarily along the US eastern seaboard. Twenty-seven cities in Florida would be the most seriously affected. The report determined that the cost of lost property would be upwards to $950 billion–a very conservative figure. The majority of the loss would be in the southern states but also a third in New York and New Jersey.

The complete loss of 5 million cubic miles of ice now blanketing the Earth, including large mountain glaciers, could raise sea levels by 216 feet. San Francisco Bay Area would be a cluster of small islands. Along with Los Angeles and San Diego, the American East Coast would vanish. Bye bye London, Venice, Netherlands and most of Denmark. From Bangladesh across Southeast Asia to the Cardamom Mountains in Cambodia, only small islets would remain. Mt Fuji would remain as a standing volcano bulging monolithically out of the Pacific. Four out of five Australians would be displaced and vast regions of Africa would be uninhabitable. Scientists are hopeful that a complete ice free planet is over a thousand years down the stretch. But without doubt humanity has entered uncharted territory on the geological map. Our technological tools and modeling systems, albeit highly sophisticated, are still incapable of the daunting task to establish precise timelines. Unpredictable events and catastrophes affecting feedback loops, such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions, oil fires or industrial plant explosions—such as the Arkema chemical plant explosion near Houston after Hurricane Harvey—and the numerical increase in extreme weather events cannot be accurately calculated into greenhouse gas simulations. Harvey’s rainfall is estimated to have been the worst in US history and the most devastating storm to hit Houston. Nineteen trillion gallons of water. For five days, the “capitol” of America’s fossil fuel industry was flooded with torrential rains and wave surges, shutting down and damaging oil refineries and chemical plants along Texas’ eastern coast. Over one million pounds of toxic pollutants and greenhouse gases were released. Such events fall outside the realm of computerized simulations and cannot be accurately included in predictive climate models. For this reason, scientific conclusions are often far more conservative than the actual state of the planet.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite mocking the idea of climate change, President Donald Trump will preside over one of the country’s sharpest drops in climate-damaging emissions on record, as the economic paralysis from the coronavirus tamps down energy use, according to an Energy Department projection on Tuesday.

The agency’s Energy Information Administration projects a 7.5% drop in fossil fuel emissions for 2020. That would be the biggest cut in U.S. energy emissions since at least 1990, EIA records show. The year after the start of the 2008 recession saw a 7.3% decline.

Trump routinely mocks the science of climate change, and his administration has moved to roll back tougher mileage and emissions standards and other climate efforts from the Obama administration.

Emissions will fall markedly this year anyway, owing to the slowing economy and restrictions on business and travel related to the coronavirus, the EIA said.

Burning of fossil fuels, and the rate of climate damage, typically rebounds as an economy does, after economic downturns.

Globally, “we’re seeing radical declines in transportation emissions and drops in other sectors of the economy,” said Stanford University’s Rob Jackson, who heads a group of independent scientists who monitor global carbon pollution. “We haven’t seen anything like this since the Great Depression.”

The energy agency projects Americans will burn 9% less gasoline and diesel and 10% less jet fuel, and that the electricity sector will generate 3% less power overall, among other declines. Solar and wind power — which get scant attention from Trump, other than his statements of loathing for wind turbines — will account for the majority of the country’s new electricity generation, the report says. As marketplace competition reshapes how Americans get their energy, power plants will use 11% more renewables and 20% less coal this year.

The 2020 outlook also marks a setback in Trump’s frequently stated mission of helping make the United States the world’s dominant player in energy production. The coronavirus and an unrelated petroleum supply glut caused by ramped-up pumping by Saudi Arabia and Russia will return the United States to being a net importer of petroleum for at least a time, as domestic drilling subsides, the EIA report said. Any global accord to cut back oil production could change that, the agency noted.

“These trends are only temporary and they’ll go away as fast as this coronavirus crisis goes away,” said climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck, the University of Michigan’s environment dean.

The story has been corrected to reflect that the University of Michigan’s environment dean, not an Energy Department spokeswoman, said a drop in climate-changing emissions during the coronavirus outbreak would be temporary.",mainstream,M0ec23,climate.change

820,"The 2021 Global Conference on Health & Climate Change with a special focus on Climate Justice, will convene at the margin of the COP26 UN climate change conference. The aim of the conference is to support and showcase Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement which are ambitious, based on the principles of justice and equity, and promote and protect health. It will also mobilize the rapidly growing movement of health professionals around the world who are now driving ambitious climate action.

The conference will be organized by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the Global Climate and Health Alliance (GCHA), in close collaboration with Glasgow Caledonian University and its Centre for Climate Justice, with the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change, and other partners.

The year 2020 will see the Paris Agreement come to life.

At its heart, the Paris Agreement is about caring for people and protecting them from an uncertain and increasingly unsafe future. Everyone has the right to a healthy environment, free of pollution and its harmful consequences.

Over 100 governments have already indicated they will update their national climate plans to the Paris Agreement (known as Nationally Determined Contributions, NDCs), and these enhanced climate plans aim to include all vital sectors, including the health sector.

The same human activities that are destabilizing the Earth’s climate also contribute directly to poor health. For example, the main driver of climate change, fossil fuel combustion, also contributes about 2/3 of human exposure to outdoor air pollution, which causes over 4 million deaths a year. Including indoor air pollution brings the total to over 7 million deaths worldwide every year – about 1 in every 8 deaths.

The overall cost to human wellbeing, and to economies, is enormous. Air pollution alone costs an estimated US$ 5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally each year. In the 15 countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, the health impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4% of their GDP. Public concern over the health impacts of air pollution is an increasing driver of social movements for action on climate change and overall environmental protection. Meeting the Paris goals would result in health gains which are twice as large as the costs of the mitigation measures from improved air quality alone.

The health gains of climate action go well beyond air quality. They range from more sustainable diets and food systems addressing the rising burden of disease associated with overweight and obesity, to urban transport systems that facilitate walking and cycling, and bringing health gains from increased physical activity.

Weighing in both the impacts of health-damaging business-as-usual policies and the massive health co-benefits of ambitious climate policy, drives climate policies that are more ambitious and health-promoting.

The Global Conference on Health & Climate Change will bring together a range of key actors in public health and climate change policy in order to incorporate public health and climate justice considerations in the UN climate negotiations. It will highlight the initiatives, policies and cross-sectoral collaborations that are driving ambitious and healthy Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement in the lead-up to COP26.

The conference will be organized by the World Health Organization - convening its 4th Global Conference on Health and Climate - and by the Global Climate and Health Alliance - convening its 8th Global Climate and Health Summit - in close collaboration with the Glasgow Caledonian University and its Centre for Climate Justice, the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change and other partners.

The overarching theme of the Conference will be Healthy and Ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, and will include sessions on the health co-benefits of a broad range of climate policies, including clean energy policies; air quality measures; subsidy reform; smart agriculture and sustainable food systems; educational and civil society involvement; nature-based solutions and others.

A series of WHO-led initiatives, case-studies and workshops throughout 2020 will feed into the outcomes of the global health & climate conference and the COP26 UN climate conference.

514,"In eosinophilic esophagitis (e-o-sin-o-FILL-ik uh-sof-uh-JIE-tis), a type of white blood cell (eosinophil) builds up in the lining of the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach (esophagus). This buildup, which is a reaction to foods, allergens or acid reflux, can inflame or injure the esophageal tissue. Damaged esophageal tissue can lead to difficulty swallowing or cause food to get stuck when you swallow.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic immune system disease. It has been identified only in the past two decades, but is now considered a major cause of digestive system (gastrointestinal) illness. Research is ongoing and will likely lead to revisions in the diagnosis and treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis.
• Food getting stuck in the esophagus after swallowing (impaction)
• Chest pain that is often centrally located and does not respond to antacids
• Food getting stuck in the esophagus after swallowing (impaction)

When to see a doctor

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience chest pain, especially if you also have shortness of breath or jaw or arm pain. These may be symptoms of a heart attack.

Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience severe or frequent eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms. If you take over-the-counter medications for heartburn more than twice a week, see your doctor.

Eosinophils are a normal type of white blood cells present in your digestive tract. However, in eosinophilic esophagitis, you have an allergic reaction to an outside substance. The reaction may occur as follows:
• Reaction of the esophagus. The lining of your esophagus reacts to allergens, such as food or pollen.
• Multiplication of eosinophils. The eosinophils multiply in your esophagus and produce a protein that causes inflammation.
• Damage to esophagus. Inflammation can lead to scarring, narrowing and formation of excessive fibrous tissue in the lining of your esophagus.
• Dysphagia and impaction. You may have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or have food become stuck when you swallow (impaction).
• Additional symptoms. You may have other symptoms, such as chest pain or stomach pain.

There has been a significant increase in numbers of people diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in the past decade. At first, researchers thought this was due to an increase in awareness among doctors and greater availability of tests. However, studies now suggest the disease is becoming increasingly common, parallel to the increase in asthma and allergy.

The following risk factors are associated with eosinophilic esophagitis:
• Climate. People who live in a cold or dry climate are more likely than those in other climates to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis.
• Season. You're more likely to be diagnosed between the spring and fall, probably because levels of pollen and other allergens are higher and people are more prone to be outdoors.
• Sex. Eosinophilic esophagitis is more common in males than in females.
• Family history. Doctors think eosinophilic esophagitis may run in the family (have a genetic component). If your family members have eosinophilic esophagitis, you have a greater chance of being diagnosed.
• Allergies and asthma. If you have food or environmental allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis or a chronic respiratory disease, you're more likely to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis.
• Age. Originally, eosinophilic esophagitis was thought to be a childhood disease, but now it is known to be common in adults as well. The symptoms differ somewhat between children and adults.

In some people, eosinophilic esophagitis can lead to the following:
• Scarring and narrowing of the esophagus. This makes it difficult to swallow and more likely that you will have food get stuck.
• Damage to the esophagus. Because of inflammation of the esophagus, endoscopy can cause perforation or tears in the tissue that lines the esophagus. Tearing can also occur in connection with retching that some people experience when they get food stuck in the esophagus.",mainstream,M07d39,climate.change

• The Final Test – Pope Launches the New World Order

“On September 26th Pope Francis (aka Jorge Mario Bergoglio or Petrus Romanus) will meet with the UN to launch an agreement known as “The Road to Dignity by 2030.” This document is simply a sugar coating of Agenda 21 and relies on the myth of man-made climate change to lock down humanity in a dystopian nightmare of total control, total surveillance and a one world government.

“Yet it must also be recognized that nuclear energy, biotechnology, information technology; knowledge of our DNA, and many other abilities, which we have acquired, have…given those with the knowledge, and especially the economic resources to use them, an impressive dominance over the whole of humanity and the entire world….In whose hands does all this power lie, or will it eventually end up? It is risky for a small part of humanity to have it.” (p.77)

 ~ Pope Francis

A Papal Encyclical is a letter concerning Catholic doctrine which is circulated by the Pope. This week, Pope Francis published a new Encyclical: Laudato Si’ of the Holy Father Francis – Care for Our Common Home.

The 180+ page document sounds the alarm regarding the global degradation of living things: people, animals and our environment.

If this document had been authored by a professor of theology, there would be much room for common ground. However, it has been written by the leader of an institution which has been the single most powerful in the Western world for the last 500 years – a period during which the central banking-warfare model has been busy harvesting our common home.

There is a profound disassociation from the nuts-and-bolts of what the Catholic Church (and its networks and investment syndicates) have been doing and the sources of their wealth. This Encyclical is, if you will, a concept piece independent of the financial and political realities of the Vatican, the Catholic Church and its allies.

Assuming that Pope Francis first and foremost addressed the Encyclical to bishops, patriarchs, primates, archbishops as well as to the general population, I would like to propose several steps which the Pope, the Vatican and the leadership of the Catholic Church (collectively, the “Church”) might take to integrate some of the best ideas in this document into the power lines controlled and influenced by the Church.

The world is struggling with propaganda, disinformation, and significant suppression of the truth. The new Pope’s efforts to provide digital access to works in the Vatican Library on a selective basis are a good start. In the meantime, there is a great deal of knowledge which the Church, its libraries and networks can share:
• The Church can accelerate access to both the Vatican Library and Archives.
• The Church can publish all its information regarding global “black budgets.” This would include any information related to invisible weaponry and technology driving the real governance systems operating on Planet Earth.
• In the context of understanding what is happening to our environment, the Church can publish all its information on global geo-engineering and weather control programs as part of an open discussion to ensure that the global population and scientific community has accurate data on what is happening to our climate.
• The Church can provide open access to its financial information and persuade its affiliates, endowments and churches to do the same, including detailed disclosure on a place-based basis.
• The Church can encourage global governments to publish their budgets and credit information on a place-based basis. Place-based financial disclosure will permit the alignment of financial ecosystems with environmental ecosystems – a critical step to ensuring a healthy environment. This will create incentive systems which reward the health and well-being of all living things.
• The Church can disclose all information on its direct and indirect involvement in any illegal activities, including vote rigging, narcotics trafficking, and money laundering.
• The Church can use its shareholdings and ownership positions in media companies to insist on integrity in public information.
• The Church can use its shareholdings in pharmaceutical and food companies to insist on integrity and independence of scientific research.
• The Church can provide a safe haven for scientists, journalists and other professionals who are targeted for upholding high standards of integrity in science and information.

Slavery contributes significantly to the degradation of people throughout our planet.
• The Church can withdraw from supporting governments, corporations or any other organizations that support any form of slavery.
• The Church can destroy the “control files” of prominent businessmen and politicians created through the use of its networks.
• The Church can complete restoration efforts related to its pedophilia activities and publish complete figures on how much the Church has spent on all restoration efforts.
• The Church can use its shareholdings and ownership positions in government and corporate securities to insist on a withdrawal of corporate and government support for mind control, torture and slavery and the compromise of individual privacy and sovereignty.

The primary source of environmental damage does not result from market economics – quite the opposite. It results from the lethal combination of organized crime operating powerful and invisible weaponry coupled with invasive digital systems and sophisticated financial tools on scale. In short, those with the ability to kill, to destroy and to steal with impunity combine such force with fiat currencies, unsustainable debt, resource extraction, financial fraud, war and genocide in order to centralize wealth and power in a manner which shrinks total wealth.

Lawlessness on a global scale must be dealt with before it destroys our planet.
• The Church can divest its holdings in governments and corporations which engage in these practices. It should encourage its affiliates and members to do the same.
• The Church can also disassociate from foundations and not-for-profits that engage in these practices or that launder profits for those who do.
• The Church can make clear that the ten commandments apply not just to what we do, but to whom and what we finance.
• The Church can stop any and all participation by itself and its networks in narcotics trafficking and disgorge the profits of the same to the people harmed.

No less than The Economist has rightly pointed out that we are chocking on debt, in part because we provide enormous tax subsidies which encourage debt (see The Great Distortion). Debt throws people out of alignment with one another and with the environment around them. Ditto fiat currency which is used in a manner to debase global populations and economies.

We must shift to an equity-based financial system which facilitates the free flow of equity unencumbered by the intervention and control of organized crime. An equity-based system – which includes the financing of small businesses, small farms and local economies with equity – will permit us to evolve a financial system in which we can generate wealth from healing our environment and reducing consumption.
• The Church can encourage these changes by shifting the significant funds it manages as well as those managed by its networks.
• The Church can encourage governments to reduce laws and regulations that prevent the local circulation of equity or that prevent the creation and success of local currency systems.

A global culture is one which respects the sovereignty of every individual. We respect human rights. We respect property rights. We respect privacy. We respect the right of each human being to make up their own mind.
• The Church can withdraw its investments from all governments and corporations (including media) which compromise people’s privacy or which manipulate them via mind control techniques, entrainment technology, subliminal programming or electronics.
• The Church can actively encourage its priests and networks to bring transparency to mind control techniques or any efforts to mislead people globally.
• The Church can offer sanctuary to scientists, government personnel or journalists who bring transparency to these efforts.

Before we dismiss capitalism, we should try it.

Organized crime is not capitalism. It is the application of force to control and to get one’s way. Market economics can solve many of the problems before us – but we have to unleash markets to work rather than prevent them from operating and then blaming the subsequent “mess” on them.
• The Church can call for all monies stolen by illegal means in the last two decades to be returned, including trillions which have disappeared from the US government or which have been accrued as a result of financial frauds prior to the bailouts.
• The Church can refrain from blaming our current situation on the people who have been harmed by these thefts or from insisting that the subsequent economic damage is a result of the victims’ poor values or “consumerism.”
• The Church can withdraw its investment from financial institutions, governments and corporations that:
• Provide unlawful or unethical support to cartels and monopolies.
• Engage in the purposeful suppression of technologies which would ease the harm we are doing to the environment.

The Church and its affiliates and members manage trillions in real estate and financial assets. As one of the most significant capitalist organizations/investment networks on our planet, it can institute policies to ensure that it does not invest in companies or governments which behave in the manner described in the latest Encyclical and that its real estate is not used to support such activities.

During Vatican II, the Church forced the sale of significant real estate holdings which were serving communities. The proceeds from these sales were reinvested in corporate securities. The Church can ensure that the Orders for whom these funds are managed have access to full transparency about these investments and are permitted to institute policies which ensure that these investments are managed in accordance with the goals of this Encyclical.

Published global military expenditures were $1.7 trillion in 2013. Add secret black budget expenditures and the total was likely much more. These funds – combined with savings from destructive behavior such as gambling, narcotics and alcohol – could be shifted into investment in healing our environment, our education systems, our health care systems and revitalizing global infrastructure.
• The Church can bring transparency to all worldwide resources which are related to killing. It can invite its members to pray that these resources be shifted to investments which increase productivity rather than enable a small group of people to own and control the planet.

Both the Church and our planet are dynamic living systems. Moving to a healthy global culture and aligning our financial ecosystems with our environmental ecosystems is a journey.
• The Church can encourage its entire network to adopt these goals in their lives so that achieving them is a partnership of the many for the benefit of all.
• The Church can publish an annual report on its efforts to take responsibility and to achieve these goals internally in its own operations, asset managements and investments and to invite feedback from all of its constituents to help it do so.

There is often a risk that any important policy will be misunderstood or misused by those who are centralizing control and power. The G-7 nations have experienced a financial coup d’etat. A great deal of money and assets have been shifted out of sovereign governments into private hands – either illegally or under the guise of trillions in bailouts and quantitative easing – while liabilities have been shifted back into governments.

Now that these transfers are complete, it would be convenient to blame the victims and to abrogate their pensions and other savings plans and promises. It would be unfortunate if this Encyclical were used to justify the value of doing so in the name of “reducing consumerism” or to politically outmaneuver the victims by accusing them of being “selfish.”

Economies function on trust and such trust must come from honoring our agreements. As Pope Francis understands, it is easy to blame the victim and to take from the powerless.

Utah Phillips once said, “The Planet is not dying, it is being killed. And the people doing the killing have names and addresses.”

We commend the Pope for calling out for a cessation of the debasement of all living things. Let us hope that his latest Encyclical starts ringing doorbells – beginning with the opportunity to do so in the Church and in the Church’s asset and investment portfolios.",conspiracy,C02bc3,aids; climate.change
673,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — A longitudinal study of 3,756 U.S. medical students provides evidence that racism in medical schools influenced their decisions on whether to practice in minority or underserved communities.

""Structural racism is deeply embedded in all areas of society, and medical education is no exception,"" according to the study in the August issue of Academic Medicine.

To examine the effect of racism in medical school, researchers surveyed students at 49 unidentified U.S. medical schools in their first semester and again in their final semester.

""This study provides evidence that racism manifested at multiple levels in medical schools was associated with graduating students' decisions to provide care in high-need communities,"" the article concludes. ""Strategies to identify and eliminate structural racism, and its manifestations in medical school are needed.""

The publication is the latest of more than 30 articles to present findings from the Medical Student Cognitive Habits and Growth Evaluation Study (CHANGES), the first longitudinal survey study of the effects of medical education on students' biases and attitudes over time.

The national study is being conducted by Oregon Health & Science University in collaboration with Mayo Clinic's Research Group on Equity and Inclusion in Health Care, Yale University and the University of Minnesota.

To limit the scope, the study focused on attitudes toward African Americans, although CHANGES explored attitudes about other groups, as well, explains first author Sean Phelan, Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic health sciences researcher.

""I hope the study will spark change,"" Dr. Phelan says. ""I would like to see more conversation about diversity and inclusion in curriculum and the need to make changes in medical training to minimize racism and bias.""

The multidisciplinary team hypothesized that three factors might reflect bias in medical education, and the results indicate that all three predicted whether students changed their minds on wanting to work in an underserved area or in a primarily minority community:
• School curricula and policies can create an unintended, structural type of racism if they lack or don't require content on cultural awareness, racial disparities and bias, or provide experience with service learning. ""We suggest that, within medical education, the types of courses that medical schools require and the information that they prioritize for training new physicians can critically shape students' interest in practicing in underserved areas,"" Dr. Phelan says.
• School culture and climate, including behaviors exhibited by faculty and attending physicians, represent a hidden curriculum on acceptable or normal ways to interact.
• Individual student attitudes and behaviors tended to change over four years of medical school. Students' negative racial attitudes at matriculation were associated with decreased intention to practice with underserved or minority populations at graduation, while students who had more interactions with black students, faculty and allied health staff, and considered those interactions favorable, were more likely to choose to practice in a black community.

The team found that racism at the structural or cultural level may reinforce a belief in social hierarchy and dissuade students from a career focused on caring for those perceived to be lower in that hierarchy. However, among students who initially intended to work with minority populations, those who witnessed examples of discrimination in medical school were more likely to stay committed to that path.
• Service learning experiences and a curriculum focused on improving minority health were associated with increased intention to practice in underserved communities.
• A curriculum focused on minority health and disparities, students' perceived skill at developing relationships with minority patients, a higher proportion of minority students at the school, and awareness of interracial tension in the medical school environment were associated with increased intention to care for minority patients.

""We've been following this cohort for a long time to understand how their experiences in medical education influence the predictors of potentially biased care,"" says Michelle van Ryn, Ph.D., the principal investigator. Dr. Van Ryn is the distinguished professor at Oregon Health & Science University's School of Nursing and former director of Mayo Clinic's Research Program on Equity and Inclusion in Health Care. ""These findings suggest that medical education leaders can take action to affect students' decisions to work with underserved populations.""

CHANGES began nearly 10 years ago. Additional surveys were conducted in the second and fourth years of residency. The final survey will be administered five years after medical school. To avoid influencing responses, the team delayed publication of findings until after students graduated from medical school.

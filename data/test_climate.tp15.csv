The party sent Michael Gove to the studio to offer to stand in for the leader 's debate , but the other leaders taking part in the debate turned him down . He arrived at the studio along with a camera , capturing the stunt for the Tories ' JJ NN outlets . This morning the regulator VBD they had rejected the complaint . A spokesman VBD : "" In this NN , the NNP Committee concluded that , across the CD - hour debate and a subsequent NN programme , Channel 4 ’s use of editorial techniques ensured that the Conservative ’s viewpoint on NN and JJ issues was adequately reflected and given due weight . They added : "" The Committee RB took into account that the globe NN sculpture was not a representation of the Prime Minister personally , and little editorial focus was given to it , either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants "" The party made a formal complaint to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom 's NN committee over what it VBD was "" a provocative partisan stunt , which MD itself constitute making a JJ opinion in its own NN "" . And a Tory source threatened to "" reconsider "" the broadcaster 's licence over the row . Mr Johnson VBD LBC the following day : "" I did n't VB the debate but it is noticeable that NNS have talked more about that than the substance that came out of the debate and I VBP that is a shame .

"" We VBP a strong free press , but the Tories are restricting journalists .

Over the past three NNS , NN NN has become a pillar of the U.S. - NNP bilateral relationship . Both NNS have taken strong measures at home to build green , low - NN and NN - resilient economies , helping galvanize JJ NN to combat NN NN and culminating in the Paris Agreement reached last December . With their joint announcement of ambitious NN actions in November 2014 , NNP Barack Obama and NNP Xi Jinping sought to lead by example , and by the NN the Paris conference opened a NN later , some 186 NNS had put forward their own NN actions . In September 2015 , the CD leaders laid out a common vision for the Paris outcome during NNP Xi’s NNP Visit to NNP and RB announced major domestic policy measures and cooperative initiatives to combat NN NN , as well as significant progress on NN finance . In Paris , the NNP NNPS and NNP , working together and with others , played a critical role in crafting a historic , ambitious JJ NN NN agreement . 2. Today , the CD Presidents announce another significant step in their joint NN efforts . The NNP NNPS and NNP will sign the Paris Agreement on April 22nd and take their respective domestic steps in order to join the Agreement as early as possible this NN . They encourage other Parties to the NNP Nations Framework Convention on NNP NNP to do the same , with a view to bringing the Paris Agreement into force as early as possible . The Presidents further express their commitment to work together and with others to promote the full implementation of the Paris Agreement to win the fight against the NN threat . 3 . The Presidents recognize that the Paris Agreement marks a JJ commitment to tackling NN NN and a strong signal of the NN for a swift transition to low - NN , NN - resilient economies . In this regard , the Presidents are RB committed to working bilaterally and with other NNS to achieve successful outcomes this NN in related multilateral fora , including on an HFC amendment under the Montreal Protocol pursuant to the Dubai Pathway and on a JJ NN - VBN measure for addressing NN gas NNS from international aviation at the International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly . To accelerate clean NN innovation and deployment , they will work together to implement the goals of the Mission Innovation initiative announced at the Paris conference and carry forward the work of the Clean NNP Ministerial . They support a successful G - 20 Summit in Hangzhou this NN , including strong NN and clean NN outcomes , and call on the G - 20 NNS to engage constructively in international cooperation on NN and NN NN . And they will continue to deepen and broaden bilateral cooperation through the U.S. - NNP NNP NNP Working Group , the U.S. - NNP Clean NNP Research Center , and other efforts . 4 . Finally , the Presidents commit to taking concrete steps to implement the commitments they made in their September 2015 Joint Statement to use JJ resources to finance and encourage the transition toward low NN technologies as a priority . Since the Joint Statement , the NNP NNPS led an effort in the OECD to successfully adopt the JJ - ever set of multilateral standards for support of coal - fired NN plants VBG export credit , and NNP has been strengthening its green and low - NN policies and regulations with a view to strictly controlling JJ investment flowing into projects with high pollution and NN NNS both domestically and internationally . 5 . The joint efforts by NNP and the NNP NNPS on NN NN will serve as an enduring legacy of the partnership between our CD NNS ."

The JJ economy has slowed , NNS have retreated to their homes and thousands have died or become seriously ill . At this frightening stage of the NN , it ’s difficult to focus on anything else . But as the International Agency has VBN , the effects of NN are likely to be temporary but the other JJ emergency – NN NN – is not . Stopping the spread of NN is paramount , but NN NN must RB continue . And we can draw JJ lessons and opportunities from the current NN NN when tackling planetary NN . S&P NNP Ratings this week VBD measures to contain NNP - CD have pushed the JJ economy into recession . JJ analyst Lauri Myllyvirta estimates the NN MD have reduced JJ NNS by 200 megatonnes of NN dioxide to date , as air travel grinds to a halt , factories close down and NN demand falls . In the JJ four weeks of the NN , coal consumption in NNP alone fell by 36 % , and oil refining capacity reduced by 34 % . In JJ ways , what we ’re seeing now is a rapid and unplanned version of JJ “ degrowth ” – the transition some academics and activists have for decades VBN is necessary to address NN NN , and leave a habitable NN for future generations . Read more : NN in a ' degrowth ' economy , and why you might actually enjoy it Degrowth is a proposed slowing of growth in sectors that damage the environment , such as fossil fuel industries , until the economy operates within NNP ’s limits . It is a voluntary , planned and equitable transition in developed nations which necessarily involves an increased focus on the environment , JJ well - being , and capabilities ( good NN , decent work , education , and a safe and healthy environment ) . Such a transformation MD be profound , and so far no nation has shown the will to implement it . It MD require JJ economies to “ decouple ” from NN to prevent NN - related crises . But the current unintended JJ slowdown opens the door to such a transition , which MD bring myriad benefits to the NN . The idea of sustainable degrowth is very JJ to a recession . It involves scaling back environmentally damaging sectors of the economy , and strengthening others . NN NN has been declared a JJ emergency , yet to date the NN has largely failed to address it . In contrast , the JJ policy response to the NN emergency has been fast and furious . There are several reasons for this dramatic difference . NN NN is a relatively slow - moving NN , whereas NN visibly escalates over days , RB hours , increasing our perception of the risks involved . CD thing that history teaches us about politics and the JJ condition in times of peril , we often take a “ NN management ” approach to dealing with serious threats . Read more : How NNS brought on by NN MD VB tackle NN NN As others have observed , the slow increase in JJ NNS means NNS can psychologically adjust as the situation worsens , making the problem seem less urgent and meaning NNS are less willing to accept drastic policy measures . The JJ response to the NN NN shows that governments can take immediate , radical emergency measures , which VBP beyond purely JJ concerns , to protect the well - being of all . Specifically , there are practical lessons and opportunities we can take away from the NN emergency as we seek to tackle NN NN : Act early : The NN NN shows the crucial importance of early NN to prevent catastrophic consequences . Governments in Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore acted quickly to implement quarantine and screening measures , and have seen relatively JJ numbers of infections . Italy , on the other hand , whose NN waited too RB to act , is now the epicentre of the NN . Read more : Running out of things to do in isolation ? VB back in the garden with these ideas from 4 experts VB slow , VB local : NN has forced an immediate scale - down of how we travel and live . NNS are forging local connections , shopping locally , working from home and limiting consumption to what they VBP . Researchers have identified that fears about personal well - being represent a major barrier to JJ support for the degrowth movement to date . However with JJ distancing expected to be in place for months , our scaled - down lives MD become the “ JJ normal ” . JJ NNS MD realise that consumption and personal well - being are not inextricably linked . JJ JJ thinking is needed . A transition to sustainable degrowth can VB . We VBP to shift JJ attention from GDP as an indicator of well - being , towards other measures that put NNS and the environment RB , such as NNP Zealand ’s well - being budget , Bhutan ’s gross national happiness index , or Ecuador ’s JJ philosophy of buen vivir ( good living ) . Spend on clean NN : The International NNP Agency ( IEA ) VBZ clean NN should be “ at the heart of stimulus plans to counter the NN NN ” . The IEA has called on governments to launch sustainable stimulus packages focused on clean NN technologies . It VBZ hydrogen and NN - capture RB VBP major investment to bring them to scale , which MD be helped by the current low interest rates . Governments MD RB use NN stimulus packages to reskill workers to service the JJ “ green ” economy , and address challenges in healthcare , sanitation , aged care , food security and education . As NN scientist Katharine Hayhoe VBD this month : The NN NN is devastating , but failing to tackle NN NN because of the NN only compounds the tragedy . Instead , we must draw on the lessons of NN to address the NN challenge ."

He_PRP said_VBD :_:","Australia ’s Iconic Platypus Has Been Pushed to the Brink of Extinction , NNPS Warn With Australia ’s spiraling JJ catastrophe receiving NN attention in recent weeks , ecologists have sounded the alarm on the dire threat faced by the country ’s endemic wildlife populations . Researchers are now warning that the platypus — the unusual duck - billed , egg - laying mammal native to eastern Australia whose existence was believed to be a hoax in the late 18th century — is CD of the iconic NNS teetering on the brink of extinction . According to a JJ NN by the NNP of NNP South Wales ( UNSW ) that was published in the scientific journal Biological Conservation , platypus numbers have declined by half or more since the European colonization of the island continent with local extinctions occurring across 40 percent of the NN natural habitat thanks to drought and JJ activity such as dam building , NN harvesting , land clearances , the impacts of livestock and threats from feral NNS . Along with other contemporary threats including the changing NN , NNS fear that platypus numbers will continue to decline between 47 percent and 66 percent by 2070 . However , when taking fast - heating NN projections into account the animal ’s decline MD rapidly fall by 51 percent to 73 over the next five decades — pushing the NNS once common in the country ’s waterways toward all - out extinction . The danger to platypuses has become alarming in recent consecutive NNS as brutal heatwaves and arid conditions made worse by the dearth of rainfall have had a devastating effect on local populations . Platypus populations , IN other aquatic NNS , are believed to have taken major damage from an intensifying drought and record heat , RB prior to the bushfire NN . AFP reports that NN co-author Gilad Bino , a researcher at the NNP of NSW ’s Centre for Ecosystem NNP , VBD : The NN recommended that national authorities give attention to the “ urgent NN ” for a NN assessment that MD downgrade the animal to “ vulnerable ” status and look at the steps necessary to conserve the NNS and “ minimize any NN of extinction . ” The NN has taken few if any measures to protect the NNS despite the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) recently downgrading the nocturnal NN ’s status to “ near threatened . ” The NN notes that such conservationist measures MD include “ increasing surveys , tracking trends , mitigating threats and improving management of platypus habitat in rivers . ” The platypus , along with four NNS of echidnas , are the NN ’s only monotremes or egg - laying mammals that secrete milk from the female bellies . Australia ’s ABC reports that conservationists have seen a precipitous drop in platypus numbers in traditional habitats such as NSW ’s Great Barrington region . Tim Faulkner , the NN of conservationist group Aussie Ark , VBD : “ In our region , they ’re all dead , they ’re gone — I ca n’t find them … They do n’t VB into hibernation … They must have NN to feed in . Private landholder management , the management of riparian zones along creeks , NN harvest as well as NN on NN trampling [ are all required ] . And VBG to the toilet in the last fragments of NN [ must RB be controlled ] . Our own parks are full of pests IN the feral fox and cats responsible for over 90 per cent of all mainland mammal extinction . ” “ The platypus that we did rescue , we had CD die the next day … Their bellies are empty and they ’re all riddled with E. coli and a greater diversity of bacteria than that . Platypus are a Gondwanan dinosaur NN — they are monotremes , egg - laying mammals , some of the oldest lineages of mammals on NN . They ’ve been in this constant east coast temperate environment , largely unchanged , for millions of NNS . To VB it now … a cesspit that ’s bacteria ridden and lifeless … certainly in our area — and this must be so wide spread — they ’re gone . ” With its unique set of physical features , early sketches of the duck - billed mammal shocked western NNS who stumbled on the existence of the platypus during the colonization of Australia . RB after the NN ’s pelt was delivered to researchers in the U.K. , the existence of the platypus was believed to be a hoax comprised of a duck ’s NN sewn onto a beaver ’s body . The NN was then hunted for its fur until the last century . NN co-author Prof. Richard Kingsford stressed that NN NN and habit destruction must be reined in . He VBD :"

Moore explained precisely how the “ Green NNP Deal ” MD end in catastrophe as half the population starved and every tree on the NN was eliminated . The environmentalist took aim at the progressive congresswoman arguing that without fossil fuels , “ How do you VB the food to the center of NNP NNP , to Manhattan , where AOC is from ? You do n’t . ” Moore already denounced the scientific community that supports NNP NNP and NNP NNP , painting it as a "" catastrophic NN "" that 's being pushed by "" corrupt NNS "" who are "" hooked on NN grants . "" The JJ NN of Greenpeace Canada VBD so - called "" green "" NNS seize the narrative to win grants and tax cuts along with favorable reporting across the NN . Mr. Moore co-founded Greenpeace in the early 1970s and campaigned for JJ issues for 50 NNS . In 2006 , he wrote to the Royal Society challenging them that there was "" no scientific proof "" NNS were causing JJ NN NN and it "" has a much better correlation with NNS in solar activity than CO2 levels . "" Tucker Carson asked Moore , “ So , you ’re CD of the founders of the most famous JJ organizations in the NN , and you VBP the ‘ Green JJ Deal ’ sounds terrifying . Tell us why . ” Well , because it MD be basically the end of civilization if 85 % of the NN ’s and RB 85 % of the U.S. 's NN in the form of coal , oil , natural gas were phased out over the next few NNS , UH ten NNS . We do not have anything to replace them with . Yes , if we went into a crash course of building nuclear reactors , we MD replace them for producing electricity . But that is n't VBG to happen because the Greens are against nuclear and they are RB against hydroelectric dams which at least is renewable . But they do n't support that either . So basically they are opposed to approximately 98.5 % of all the electricity that we are VBG and nearly 100 % of all of the vehicle and transportation and ships and planes NN that we are VBG . So when I tweeted the other day , and it had a huge response , over three CD impressions on NNP , I VBD , you do n’t have a plan to feed eight CD NNS without fossil fuels or VB the food into the cities , where it ’s needed . That requires JJ trucks , and there ’s not VBG to be any electric trucks any NN soon hauling forty tons of food into the supermarkets where the NNS in the cities probably VBP it originates , in the supermarket . But it does not . It ’s coming from farms out in the country , where a few CD NNS are growing the food for all the rest of the population . And if we ban fossil fuels , RB , agricultural production MD collapse in a very short period of NN . There are these things called tractors , and they use fuel , and all the other implements on the farm , and then there ’s the transportation . So when you have no fuel , how do you VB the food to the center of NNP NNP , to Manhattan , where AOC is from ? You do n’t . Then the NNS there will begin to starve , and that will spread out as a rot from the center of the metropolises all across the country , and half the population will die in a very short period . And as I RB pointed out , there MD n’t be a tree left on this NN . VB this was a worldwide thing , because the NNP NNPS is not VBG to ban fossil fuels if no NN else does ; but VB the Paris Agreement came into effect , fully all IN the NN and everybody banned fossil fuels , there MD n’t be a tree left on this NN because that MD be all there was for fuel , for heating and cooking , as they did in the old days , when there was hardly anybody on the NN compared to what there is today . So just that CD point , never VB the insanity of banning aircraft and fossil fuel - VBG vehicles . “ Well , you ’ve just completely blown my NN . And I knew some of that , but the NN you put it was RB stirring . ” [ RELATED ] Ocasio - Cortez Arrives in Gas-Guzzling SUV to Lecture Americans on NN NN"

Sign_VB up_RP for_IN the_DT newsletter_NN ._.","In 1916 , Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton was forced to make a treacherous voyage across the open waters of the Southern Ocean after his ship Endurance was crushed by pack NN and sank in the Weddell NNP . Along with five members of his party , Shackleton set out for the island of South Georgia in a 23 - NN - JJ wooden lifeboat named the James Caird . Eleven days into the trip , on NNP 5 , Shackleton thought he spied a clearing in the murky sky above . What he was actually seeing was n’t a break in the clouds , but the white crest of a monstrous wave bearing down on them . “ During twenty - six NNS ’ experience of the ocean in all its moods I had not encountered a wave so gigantic , ” Shackleton MD later write in his book South : The Story of Shackleton ’s Last Expedition 1914 - 1917 . “ It was a mighty upheaval of the ocean , a thing quite apart from the JJ white - capped seas that had been our tireless enemies for JJ days . ” Shackleton ’s account remains CD of the most evocative descriptions of the westerly winds that circle the globe between 30 and 60 degrees latitude in both hemispheres and the colossal waves they whip up in the Southern Ocean . Today , the southern westerlies are back in focus for entirely JJ reasons : their potential impact on NN NN . The NN ’s oceans take up more than a quarter of the NN NNS are emitting into the atmosphere , partially mitigating the NN effect of that NN . And the Southern Ocean accounts for nearly 40 percent of this marine NN absorption , RB though it makes up only CD - fifth of NNP ’s ocean NN area . There MD be enormous consequences for our already VBG NN from RB a JJ reduction in the Southern Ocean ’s ability to suck up NN from the atmosphere . NNS VBP this reduction MD already be happening , and they suspect that the westerlies in the Southern Hemisphere , which are stronger than their northern counterparts because they blow mostly over open NN , are to blame . Records of actual wind speeds , as well as estimates of wind speeds from measurements of atmospheric pressure , provide clear signs that the westerlies in both hemispheres are shifting toward the poles and intensifying . NN models show that these NNS are partly due to JJ NN , and research is afoot to determine if they are hindering the Southern Ocean ’s capacity to pull NN out of the atmosphere . “ There are questions about what ’s VBG to happen if the winds continue to VB stronger , ” VBZ paleoclimate scientist Krystyna Saunders of the Australian Nuclear NNP and Technology Organisation in Sydney . “ How much can the oceans actually absorb ? ” Saunders and her colleagues are finding clues that over the past 12,000 NNS of NNP ’s history , higher wind speeds and greater concentrations of NN dioxide in the atmosphere have gone together . If this link between wind and CO ₂ holds JJ today , it will lead to higher levels of the NN gas in the atmosphere , which will speed up NN NN , which MD further intensify the westerlies . There ’s growing NN that , at least in the winter months when the westerlies are at their most violent , some parts of the Southern Ocean are giving off more of the gas than was previously estimated . It has all the makings of a vicious cycle . The westerlies are the result of a JJ atmospheric circulation NN , starting with what is called the Hadley cell . The cell forms as warm , moist air near the equator rises into the upper atmosphere and then , as it cools and dries , much of it sinks down toward NNP at about 30 degrees latitude in each hemisphere . Lower in the atmosphere , this air moves back toward the equator , completing the cell . Some of this downward - moving mass of air escapes the Hadley cell and moves away from the equator , and is deflected by NNP ’s rotation , creating the westerlies . Because the westerlies form at the edge of each hemisphere ’s Hadley cell that is closest to the pole , the bigger the size of the cell , the more the winds move toward the pole . NNS collected by NN balloons , satellites and other means VBG back to 1960 show that NNP ’s tropical belt has widened in the past few decades by a few degrees of latitude , effectively expanding the size of the Hadley cells . This is partly due to JJ NN , as predicted by NN models . At the same NN , the westerlies have been pushed poleward . With less distance to cover as they circle a narrower part of the globe , the law of conservation of angular momentum dictates that the winds should increase in speed , much IN an NN skater rotates faster when she draws in her arms . And measurements during the past three decades show that the westerlies have , indeed , intensified . As researchers were making sense of these NNS to the westerlies , other NNS began VBG measurements of CO₂ levels in the atmosphere to determine whether the shifting , speedier westerlies are causing a drop in the amount of CO ₂ being absorbed by the Southern Ocean . They had reason to suppose that this MD happen . IN any gas , NN dioxide exerts a pressure that depends on the amount of the gas relative to other gases in a mixture . If this so - called partial pressure of NN dioxide ( pCO₂ ) of the atmosphere is greater than the pCO ₂ of the ocean , then the ocean will absorb NN from the atmosphere . Otherwise it will release it . And as the westerlies VBP stronger , the pCO ₂ of the Southern Ocean MD VB , due to shifts in the pattern of ocean currents . The westerlies drive the Southern Ocean current that circles Antarctica . The predominantly west - to - east current is further acted upon by a force generated by NNP ’s rotation , VBN as the Coriolis force , which deflects moving objects to their NN in the Northern Hemisphere and to their left in the Southern Hemisphere . The current circling Antarctica is deflected to its left , or northward , pushing the NN waters away from the pole . This sets the stage for NN from deep in the Southern Ocean to move to the NN . Up to 80 percent of all the deep NN that returns to the NN IN the globe makes that return in the Southern Ocean . “ It ’s unique , ” VBZ NN scientist Joellen Russell of the NNP of Arizona in Tucson . “ There 's nothing IN it in the NN . ” This massive upwelling of the deeper , NN - rich waters of the Southern Ocean increases the pCO ₂ of the ocean NN , which decreases its capacity to act as a NN sink , the argument goes . But is this what is actually happening ? The Southern Ocean has been loath to reveal its workings . This is due to the complicating effects of local wind patterns and the fact that researchers are only just beginning to make direct measurements of the outgassing of CO ₂ during peak winter months there . So far , the NNS paint a somewhat confusing , and concerning , picture . Previous estimates had shown that between 1981 and 2004 , the Southern Ocean absorbed about 80 CD fewer metric tons of NN per NN than expected . This was a NN for concern , given that the Southern Ocean is “ the most important marine NN sink on the NN , ” VBZ ocean biogeochemist Peter Landschützer of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg , Germany . So Landschützer and his colleagues took a closer look at a JJ database of pCO ₂ values , created from observations of NN waters by instruments deployed in the NN or carried on research and commercial ships . VBN as the NNP Ocean CO₂ Atlas ( SOCAT ) and established in 2007 , it contains almost 26 CD observations of JJ oceans and coastal seas from 1957 to 2019 . Since NNS are sparser for the earlier decades than for recent NNS , Landschützer ’s team filled in the gaps VBG other , less direct but more frequently measured parameters such as NN NN NN and salinity and their well - understood relationship to pCO ₂ of NN waters . They estimated that the Southern Ocean had indeed taken in less CO₂ than expected from 1982 to 2001 . The trend reversed in 2002 , with the ocean acting as a more vigorous NN sink all the NN up to 2011 . From 2011 to CD , however , the Southern Ocean went back to being less effective in its NN absorption . The team tried to find a link between the NNS in the Southern Ocean ’s ability to absorb CO ₂ and the poleward - shifted westerlies . “ We were quite surprised that we did not , ” Landschützer VBZ . This called for an explanation , and the answer turned out to be complicated . Further analysis showed that the changing westerlies are , indeed , increasing the upwelling of NN - rich deep waters near Antarctica . This effect , though , is being offset further north in the Southern Ocean by an increased NN uptake in regions where the westerlies are blowing less vigorously than in the past . This MD imply that there should be no overall NN in the absorption of NN . But Landschützer ’s team VBD that the Southern Ocean ’s ability to absorb NN is increasing or decreasing over timescales of roughly a decade . The researchers put these flips down to the local wind patterns in JJ parts of the Southern Ocean VBN as the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian sectors . Winds there seem to VB every decade , as evidenced by about 35 NNS of NNS , and those local alterations line up well with NN absorption trends , Landschützer VBZ . All of the above analysis was VBN on NNS collected by ships plying the Southern Ocean mainly during summer . The NNS for the winter season was spotty ; it is hard for ships to venture close to Antarctica at that NN . So Landschützer ’s team VBD the richer summer NNS and the sparse winter NNS to extrapolate and account for the winter months as best they MD . But in recent NNS , researchers have started VBG floats that are offering a JJ , broader glimpse of winter goings - on in the Southern Ocean . And the NNS are disconcerting . Oceanographer Alison Gray of the NNP of NNP and her colleagues VBD NNS collected by 35 of these autonomous floats , deployed by the Southern Ocean NNP and NNP Observations and Modeling ( SOCCOM ) project . The floats , which had continuously monitored the top 2,000 meters of the Southern Ocean waters from NNP 1 , 2014 , to NNP 1 , 2017 , have sensors for a range of ocean NN parameters , and these can be VBN to calculate the pCO ₂ of the NN waters . The analysis by Gray ’s team showed that the Southern Ocean IN Antarctica is outgassing significantly more CO₂ in the winter than Lanschützer ’s methodology estimated . To VB if they MD resolve the discrepancy , Landschützer and colleagues combined the NN sets and VBD that “ the truth lies somewhere in the middle , ” he VBZ : The NN uptake is not as low as the direct float measurements suggest , but neither is it as high as estimated by the ship - only NN . While more work will VB NN NNS understand exactly what ’s happening in the Southern Ocean , for the NNP of Arizona ’s Russell , the direct winter NNS from the SOCCOM floats is already raising alarms . “ In the deep winter , when the winds are howling the strongest and the deepest layers are being stirred to the NN , that ’s when we 're tapping those older NN waters , ” she VBZ . “ And that 's what 's worrisome . ” The deep waters are NN - rich because of the microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton that live in the NN waters . The phytoplankton photosynthesize the CO₂ in the NN into organic molecules to build their bodies . When they die , they sink to the ocean floor , sequestering the NN for centuries . Some phytoplankton are consumed by larger organisms called zooplankton , which in turn are eaten by RB bigger creatures whose NN - rich fecal pellets and dead bodies can RB end up on the ocean floor , burying ever more NN in the deep waters . The NN from the SOCCOM floats suggests that it ’s these deep waters that are upwelling during the Antarctic winters . “ It 's the old rotted NN that normally takes hundreds of NNS to circulate out of the deep , ” Russell VBZ . NNS surmise that intensifying westerlies are bringing more of this NN - rich deep NN to the NN — but they VBP more NN . CD NN to confirm that speedier westerlies have an impact on Southern Ocean outgassing , and thus on the levels of atmospheric CO₂ , is to look at past NN NN . Krystyna Saunders and her colleagues decided to look for some of that NN on subantarctic Macquarie Island , which lies about 1,500 kilometers from Tasmania , midway between Australia and Antarctica . At latitude degrees 54S , it ’s RB in the main band of the westerlies . Getting to Macquarie Island is no JJ feat , RB on the Aurora Australis , a 311 - NN - JJ icebreaker . Despite its size , the ship can be tossed RB by massive swells , the kind Shackleton wrote about . “ You can be lying down in your bunk , rolling from side to side and head to NN as the ship swirls RB , ” Saunders VBZ . “ If you VBP seasick IN me , it ’s quite horrible . ” On Macquarie Island , Saunders and her colleagues capitalized on a fortuitous natural record that provides clues to how strongly the winds IN the island have blown in the past . That record lies at the bottom of Emerald Lake , a body of freshwater on the island ’s western edge . It ’s exposed to the westerlies and thus to salty ocean spray blown in by the winds : The greater the wind speeds , the higher the salinity of the lake . The salinity in turn affects which NNS of diatoms , types of algae , can thrive in the lake . When they die , diatoms sink to the bottom of the lake and are buried in sediments on the lakebed , creating a layered chronicle of the salinity of the lake — and by proxy the speed of the winds . Saunders ’ team extracted sediment cores from the lakebed , focusing on layers that had accumulated during the Holocene , the present epoch in NNP ’s history that began about 11,700 NNS ago at the end of the last NN age . Having inferred the speeds of westerlies over the course of the Holocene , they then looked at NNS from NN cores drilled in Antarctica to VB a direct measure of the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere over that same NN period . They VBD a clear correlation . “ If you look at periods when the winds were above their average strengths , and periods when NN dioxide was above its average concentration , they overlap , ” Saunders VBZ . This has implications for our understanding of the effect the westerlies have on the Southern Ocean ’s capacity to absorb NN . Saunders ’ NN supports the idea that as the westerlies speed up , the Southern Ocean will outgas more CO₂ — as shown by Gray ’s report on wintertime NNS collected by the SOCCOM floats — and goes against the analysis of 35 NNS of ship - VBN NNS by Landschützer ’s team . Only more studies , along the lines of Landschützer ’s attempt to reconcile the various datasets , will VB resolve this debate . There ’s CD more factor that MD feed into the vicious cycle that NNS fear MD already be underway in the Southern Ocean . NNS in the extensive Atlantic Ocean circulation NN that includes the Gulf Stream MD RB be exacerbating the NN of the Southern Ocean , which in turn MD be adding to the poleward shift and intensification of the westerlies . This circulation NN , called the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation , or AMOC , brings warm , salty NN NN to the north , where it cools and sinks and then heads back to the Southern Hemisphere through deeper ocean layers . NNS have VBN NN that the AMOC has been slowing down , particularly in the last 150 NNS compared to the preceding 1,500 NNS . CD indication of this is that particles being deposited on the ocean floor have been getting smaller and smaller : Fast - flowing NN can whisk away smaller particles , allowing only the larger particles to settle , whereas slower NN allows smaller and smaller particles to drop to the floor . Some of the AMOC ’s slowdown can be attributed to CD of the consequences of JJ NN : an increasing supply of glacial meltwater into the North Atlantic . This fresh NN reduces the salinity , and hence the density , of the NN waters . The formation of dense , salty , cold NN is essential for it to sink down to the deep ocean in the North , from where it makes its return to the Southern Hemisphere . This process is being disrupted by NN NN . Since 2004 , a project called RAPID has deployed moorings across the breadth and depth of the Atlantic at latitude degrees 26N ( stretching from Florida to Morocco ) , to directly measure NNS in the velocity of the AMOC . The measurements show that the current is indeed slowing down . But because of inherent decade - to - decade variations in the NN NN , 15 NNS ’ worth of direct measurements is n’t enough to establish a trend . So Levke Caesar , then with the Potsdam Institute for NNP Impact Research in Germany , and her colleagues extended this record back in NN by VBG actual measurements of NN NN NNS from 1870 to CD , combined with a high - resolution NN model to reconstruct the strength of the AMOC over the past 150 NNS or so . Their work shows that the circulation NN ’s strength declined to a minimum IN 1990 , then grew until the early 2000s , and then started declining again . Other NNS have VBN similar results . As RB as NN gas NNS continue to rise , “ all NN models predict a slowdown of the AMOC , ” Caesar VBZ . Because the AMOC transports heat from the south to the north , a slowdown effectively cools the Northern Hemisphere and heats up the Southern Hemisphere . This NN RB intensifies the westerlies and shifts them toward the South Pole , leading to a greater vertical churning of the Southern Ocean , which MD contribute to JJ NN by weakening the ocean ’s ability to absorb CO₂ . Since the likely result is RB more glacial meltwater flowing into the North Atlantic , this MD further weaken the AMOC . It has all the makings of a NN that ’s slipping out of NN . A similar runaway process is thought to have ended the last NN age , raising CO₂ levels from about 180 to 240 parts per CD . This rise happened from about 17,500 NNS ago to 11,700 NNS ago , causing the deglaciation that made NNP more habitable . Atmospheric CO ₂ levels are now past a whopping 410 ppm due to JJ activity , and rising . In a mere 250 NNS , we have increased CO ₂ levels by more than the amount that melted an icy NN over thousands of NNS . The winds are howling again over the Southern Ocean and are dangerously close to awakening a beast that , until now , has been helping us by absorbing copious amounts of NN . But RB the Southern Ocean is unlikely to cooperate forever . Editor 's note : An earlier version of the map showing how the westerlies are made had incorrect placement of NNP ’s geography .

By VBG this NNS , NNS have seen an average combined land and ocean NN NN increase of 0.85 °C since the end of the 19th century . In the northern hemisphere , the period between 1983 and 2012 was the warmest 30 - NN period of the last 1,400 NNS . The degree to which the NN warms in the future will depend on natural NN variability and the level of NN gas NNS . If NN gas NNS continue then average JJ NNS will rise . However , some regions such as the Arctic will warm faster than others . Over the past 50 to 100 NNS , photographic NN has shown that the NN 's glaciers have been melting , which has caused them to retreat . The increase in JJ NNS is causing glaciers to disappear and is increasing the melting of NN NN in the Arctic . NNS often use NN cores to detect NNS in NNS . When snow falls it traps air into the NN . When NNS take a sample of NN it reveals the atmospheric gas concentrations at the NN the snow fell . This is VBN to calculate NN at that NN . The NN can reveal the NN of each NN for the past 400,000 NNS . NNS that VBP the NN cores VBP there is clear NN that there has been a rapid increase in NN in the past decades . In recent NNS there have been signs of a seasonal shift - spring arrives earlier and winters tend to be less severe . These seasonal NNS affect the nesting and migration patterns of wildlife . Between 1901 and 2010 , average JJ NN level rose by 0.19 m ."

Delaying NN any further will make it impossible to reach desired NN goals . The NN for "" rapid and transformational "" NN to limit JJ NN is now , the report VBZ . Current measures will not keep JJ NN increases within the 1.5 - to - 2 - degree Celsius range ( a "" safe "" level to which NNS can rise and not VB devastation , though 1.5 degrees is preferable ) , according to the report issued Tuesday . At the current rate , NNS are expected to rise 3.2 degrees Celsius ( 5.8 degrees Fahrenheit ) by 2100 , the UNEP report VBZ . The NNS the UNEP suggests are extreme : To VB NNP back on track to the 1.5 - degree goal , NNS must multiply their commitment level , or the level at which they pledge to reduce their NNS , five times the current rates outlined in the Paris accords . That means JJ NN gas NNS must fall at least 7.6 % every NN to remove 32 gigatons of NN dioxide from the atmosphere . Incremental NN is no longer enough to stall off the potentially devastating effects of a changing NN , the report 's authors write . What the NN needs now , they VBP , is "" rapid and transformational NN . "" G20 NNS account for 78 % of JJ NN gas NNS , but only five of 20 member NNS have set a date to reach net - zero NNS by . Of those , only CD have created legislation to enforce those goals . The US leads G20 NNS in per-capita NNS , excluding NN gases from land use , at just above 20 tons of NN dioxide per capita in 2018 . And 2020 is a critical NN for NN NN : NNS will renegotiate their commitments at the UN NN NN conference in Glasgow , but they 'll have to take extensive NN to avert a future NN , VBD Anne Olhoff , the head of strategy in the UNEP 's NN planning and policy division . "" They VBP to be significantly strengthened if we are to bridge or narrow the gap , "" she VBD CNN . Some progress has been made in the NNS since the Paris Agreement : Six G20 member NNS are projected to meet the commitments they made -- which means they have room to raise the ceiling for NN removal RB higher . But drivers IN JJ growth , which is substantially higher than what was initially expected when the Paris Agreement was created , and population growth have "" more than outweighed good progress made on NN NN , "" she VBD . The report outlines some essential NNS to chip away at NNS , including decarbonizing transport . Few NNS have sufficient policies and actions in place to achieve this measure , Olhoff VBD , but establishing vehicle emission standards and investing in JJ transportation that runs on electricity are possible , if expensive , steps toward it . Pricing NN -- making major polluters pay for their NNS -- provides an incentive for major emitters to reduce their output . It 's often calculated from the NN they extract from the NN in terms of JJ damage or NN care costs , though the NNS that have already implemented this measure MD VB to hike up the cost , per the report . Another measure , phasing out coal NN plants , is more realistic now , Olhoff VBD . Renewable NN technology is increasingly affordable , with utility - scale solar NN and wind turbines within competitive NN of the operating costs of existing coal plants . "" There 's RB no JJ argument for not VBG full - force at renewable NN , "" she VBD . JJ recalibration will require fundamental structural NNS across most of the NN , the report acknowledges . It wo n't be cheap . NN policies consistent with the 1.5 - degree goal MD cost up to $ 3.6 trillion per NN globally , according to the UNEP . But the cost likely outweighs the consequences of inaction . The adaptations humankind MD VB to make to survive in a NN where NNS have risen more than 1.5 degrees Celsius MD seriously damage the JJ economy and reduce food security and biodiversity , according to the report . What 's more , delaying NN further MD force JJ powers to remove NN dioxide from the atmosphere at a magnitude that current technology and resources have n't caught up with yet , the report warns . "" NN protection and NN investments will become a precondition for peace and stability , "" the report 's authors write , and will require "" unprecedented "" efforts to transform nearly every sector of society . There 's growing demand from the NN to VB those NNS implemented , Olhoff VBD . The difficult part is executing NN in such a NN that does n't disrupt society completely . It 's worked for some : Olhoff offered South Africa as an example , as it's made gradual but important progress in phasing out coal NN plants . But in India , where coal leads the NN NN and powers the economy , a NN that drastic MD result in JJ upheaval . "" If we VBP to be serious about limiting JJ NN , we VBP to act now and we VBP to take it seriously , "" she VBD ."

Before I explain , I should come clean . I am writing this on the train from Christchurch to Kaikoura , where I will give a talk about my recent book # NoFly : walking the talk on NN NN . I have some NN in this game . Read more : Flight shame : flying less plays a JJ but positive part in tackling NN NN Taking a train IN NNP Zealand is no mean feat . In the North Island , the train between Auckland and Wellington runs only every second day . If you VBP off at a stop along the NN , you have to wait another CD days to continue your journey .

Politicians and corporate NNS departments will take note if we start acting together . Aviation affects the NN in a variety of ways . Because any NN dioxide you emit stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of NNS , it does n’t matter much whether you release it from the exhaust pipe of your car at NN level or from a jet engine several kilometres high . Per passenger , a flight from Auckland to Wellington will put a similar amount of NN dioxide into the air as driving solo in your car . Catching the train will cut your NN NNS seven - fold . When aircraft burn jet fuel , however , they RB emit short - lived gases IN nitrogen oxides , which can react with other gases in the air within a day of being released . When nitrogen oxides are released at altitude they can react with oxygen to put more ozone into the air , but can RB remove methane . Ozone and methane are both NN gases , so this chain of chemical reactions can lead to both heating and cooling effects . Unfortunately the net result when these processes are added together is to drive more NN . Depending on the atmospheric conditions , aircraft can RB create contrails : clouds of tiny NN crystals . The NN is not as clear cut on how contrails influence the NN , but some studies suggest they MD have an effect as significant as the NN dioxide released during a flight . There is RB considerable uncertainty as to whether aircraft exhaust might affect cloud formation itself - this MD be a further significant contribution to NN . Read more : NN explained : why do n't we have electric aircraft ? Offsetting , by planting trees or restoring natural wildlands , will take NN dioxide back out of the atmosphere . But we MD have to do this on a massive scale to feed our appetite for flight . NNS from international air travel are not included in the Paris Agreement , although the NNP Nations has been working on the NNP Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation ( CORSIA ) , which MD begin to deal with these . Initially , the scheme will be voluntary . Airlines flying routes between NNS that join the scheme will have to offset any NNS above 2020 levels from January 2021 . NNS from flying stand to triple by 2050 if demand for air travel continues to grow . RB if air travel became NN neutral through the use of biofuels or electric planes , the effects from contrails and interactions with clouds mean that flying MD never be NN neutral . With no easy fixes on the horizon , JJ NNS are thinking hard about their NN to fly . This is why I took a NN off air travel ( alongside my colleague Quentin Atkinson ) in 2018 . I have been back on planes in 2019 , but I have learned how to reduce my flying , by combining trips and making better use of NN conferencing . Fly if you must , offset if you can , but – if you are concerned about NN NN – CD of the best things you MD choose to do is to fly less ."

NNS VBP that if the East Antarctic NNP Sheet – which is 60 times the size of England – melts , NN levels MD rise by four metres , putting areas of the UK at NN of disappearing entirely . Experts are now warning that more needs to be done to prevent continued JJ NN . Melting NN can have a devastating effect on the NN , causing the NN to heat up more quickly , changing ocean circulation systems that regulate JJ NN , and increasing the NN of flooding and tsunamis damage . A NN into historical NN loss suggests RB "" moderate NN "" of NNP MD melt the East Antarctic NNP Sheet . "" With current JJ NNS already CD degree higher than during pre-industrial times , future NN loss seems inevitable if we fail to reduce NN NNS , "" VBD Dr David Wilson , of Imperial College London , who worked on the research . NNS have poured lots of effort into investigating the West Antarctic NNP Sheet , which mostly sits on land below NN level . Due to its low - lying position , it contributes to most of the continent 's NN melt today . But experts at Imperial College London and the NNP of Queensland have now investigated risks facing the East Antarctic NNP Sheet . The EAIS is the largest NN sheet on NNP , and poses a major hazard if it disappears . Now a NN in Nature suggests that 2 °C of NN over "" a couple of millennia "" MD VB significant melting of the EAIS . "" Antarctica is RB twice the size of Australia , with NN sheets several kilometres thick and containing RB half of the NN 's fresh NN , "" VBD Dr Kevin Welsh , at the NNP of Queensland , a co-author on the NN . "" The East Antarctic NNP Sheet covers about CD thirds of the area , and because its base is largely above NN level it was generally thought to be less sensitive to NN climates than the adjacent West Antarctic NNP Sheet . "" However , some areas – IN the Wilkes Land Subglacial Basin , directly south of Australia – are below NN level and contain enough NN to raise JJ NN levels by several metres . "" The NN we have suggests that with the predicted 2 °C NN in Antarctica – if sustained over a couple of millennia – the sheet MD start melting in these locations . "" Glaciers , which are created by NN sheets , grind up rocks on land . These rocks are then transported into the nearby Southern Ocean as sediment . This creates a record of earlier erosion by the NN sheet . Researchers chemically analysed layers of sediment from the ocean floor , which MD have originated from the Wilkes Subglacial Basin – collected as part of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program . The NN looked at sediment layers that had settled on the seafloor during the four warm intervals occurring between NN ages over the last 450,000 NNS . "" Studying NN sheet behaviour in the geological past can inform us about future NNS , "" VBD Dr Wilson . "" By building a picture of how the NN sheet has grown and shrunk as NNS have fluctuated , we can understand the response of the EAIS to future NN . "" The team VBD chemical "" fingerprints "" in the sediment which revealed the patterns of erosion as the NN sheet advanced and retreated . It turned out that the NN sheet had retreated from its current size during some of these warmer "" interglacial "" periods , between 125,000 and 400,000 NNS ago . Importantly , at the NN , NNS were as little as CD degrees warmer than pre-industrial times – and CD degree warmer than today . During these warmer periods , JJ NN levels were between six and 13 metres higher than they are today . According to researchers , if all the NN in the Wilkes Subglacial Basin melted in modern times , JJ NN levels MD rise by up to four metres . "" We VBD that the most extreme NNS in the NN sheet occurred during CD interglacial periods 125,000 and 400,000 NNS ago , when JJ NN levels were several metres higher than they are today , "" Dr Walsh explained . "" These periods MD be analogues for future climates and it seems likely that NN loss from the East Antarctic NNP Sheet contributed to those higher NN levels . "" NN loss contributes to rising JJ NN levels which are a threat to JJ coastal communities , and making projections requires a solid understanding of how sensitive these NN sheets are . "" CD of the biggest concerns about rising NN levels is the NN than smaller , more common tsunamis MD have a more damaging effect than they do today . Last month , NNS issued a warning about the NN of “ devastating tsunamis ” caused by NN NN . Research in NNP Advances suggested that rising NN levels – caused by JJ NN – significantly increase the threat of giant killer waves . Experts modelled the impact of tsunamis VBN on NN level increases , and discovered worrying results . It VBD that rising NN levels allowed tsunamis to reach much further inland , significantly increasing the NN of floods . This means JJ tsunamis that might not be deadly today MD wreak havoc in the future . “ Our research shows that NN - level rise can significantly increase the tsunami hazard , which means that smaller tsunamis in the future can have the same adverse impacts as JJ tsunamis MD today , ” VBD Robert Weiss , a professor of geosciences at Virginia Tech . And if you VBP Britain is safe from tsunamis , VB again . Earlier this week , research revealed that deadly tsunamis crashing into the UK is more common than previously thought . NNS VBP three killer waves have hit the UK within the last 10,000 NNS – raising the possibility that another NN MD be due . We already knew about CD of these : RB 8,200 NNS ago , the Storegga submarine landslide off the coast of Norway sparked a 20 - metre high tsunami that swept across Shetland .

Recent publications have exclusively focused on a few prominent spring leaf unfolding phases and results of those MD be strongly related to the choice of analysed NNS , having JJ sensitivities and covering JJ seasons . Phenology is controlled by seasonal patterns in the NN signal ( Lapenis FW al. , 2014 ) and these will vary by location ( spatial differences in the NN signal ) and NN period ( temporal differences in the NN signal , e.g. Rutishauser FW al. , 2009 ) . Consequently , this update is more than timely since the NN signal has not been stable , but temporal variations or trends in NN NN have been reported , especially related to the so called hiatus or standstill period ( Zang , Jochner ‐ Oette , Cortés , Rammig , & Menzel , 2019 ) . A publication has already indicated that there were no trends in spring and autumn phenology during this NN hiatus period ( Wang FW al. , 2019 ) . Another phenological regime shift in the mid‐1980s was RB related to discontinuous NN NNS ( Reid FW al. , CD ) . NN sensitivity has RB been shown to vary with specific plant traits , such as evolutionary relatedness , and to support invasions and plant performance ( e.g. Wolkovich , Cook , & Davies , 2014 ) . For wheat and maize in agriculture there are hints of geographic differences among cultivars in sensitivity to vernalization , day length and NN ( Van Bussel , Stehfest , Siebert , Müller , & Ewert , 2015 ) . However , there are still major NN gaps concerning the so‐called ‘ JJ ’ phenological phases , such as sowing or harvesting in agriculture , whose timings are decided by farmers . The GCB2006 NN and follow ‐up publications provided the JJ NN that the phenological signal in agriculture was weaker than the signal for wild growing plant NNS ( Bock , Sparks , Estrella , & Menzel , 2013 ; Estrella , Sparks , & Menzel , 2007 ; Menzel , Sparks , Estrella , Koch , FW al. , 2006 ; Menzel , Vopelius , Estrella , Schleip , & Dose , 2006 ) . However , it can be anticipated that , sooner or later , agricultural management and / or choice of cultivars will RB be adapted to the JJ potential growing seasons . The drivers of autumn phenology , such as leaf colouring and leaf fall , are still far from being completely understood ( Estrella & Menzel , 2006 ; Gallinat , Primack , & Wagner , CD ; Gill FW al. , 2015 ; Wu FW al. , 2018 ) . Major factors that MD impact on the results of this update are JJ NNS in ( apparent ) NN sensitivity ( e.g . Fu , Piao , FW al. , 2015 ; Fu , Zhao , FW al. , 2015 ) . NN ‐specific increases in heat requirements related to a decrease in chilling have been especially identified as the main reason ( Fu , Piao , FW al. , 2015 ) . However , there are RB contrasting opinions for example , by Wang FW al. ( 2017 ) . Güsewell , Furrer , Gehrig , and Pietragalla ( 2017 ) showed that for Switzerland there are still no indications of a lack of chilling leading to altered NN sensitivities . NNS in NN sensitivities are reported as not uniform over NN ( Chen FW al. , 2019 ) and , in particular , a weakened NN response was observed since 2000 ( Fu FW al. , 2014 ) . Spatial variations in NN sensitivity have been linked to mean annual NN and to seasonal NN range ( Lapenis , Henry , Vuille , & Mower , 2014 ; Menzel , Sparks , Estrella , & Roy , 2006 ; Wang FW al. , 2014 ) . Both major backup systems to prevent a premature spring development ( chilling , photoperiod ) MD finally lead to nonlinear responses of phenological onset dates to forcing NNS ( Jochner , Sparks , Laube , & Menzel , CD ) . Thus , the well ‐accepted role of phenology as a NN NN indicator is VBN on the formal attribution of shifted phenological onset dates to anthropogenic ‐induced NN ( Rosenzweig FW al. , 2007 , 2008 ) , demonstrating at the same NN that the phenological trends are not just natural variability , for example , as shown by Guan ( 2014 ) for CD phenophases which unequivocally corresponded to the respective winter / spring NN trends . Most studies , however , rely on proof of the sensitivity of phenological phases to NN as the fundamental prerequisite of NN NN detection and attribution , and have linked phenological NNS to NN increases ( e.g . Cook FW al. , 2012 ; Thackeray FW al. , CD ) . Since there is thorough NN that spring phenological development is RB partially triggered by fulfilment of winter chilling and by photoperiod ( e.g. Laube FW al. , 2014 ; Tang FW al. , CD ; Vitasse & Basler , 2013 ) , it is debated whether phenological NNS still mirror the recent ongoing NN , or mirror it to the same extent as before . Therefore , an update of the assessment of phenological NNS across Europe and their attribution to NN NN is necessary . In contrast to the GCB2006 publication , this update will uniquely concentrate on plant phenology . Although plant phenology is CD of the oldest forms of JJ monitoring , with phenological observations taken by ancient civilizations ( Koch FW al. , 2007 ; Schwartz , 2003 ) , it was only in the 1990s that its renaissance started with key publications on detection of NN NN impacts on JJ vegetation . Keeling , Chin , and Whorf ( 1996 ) were the JJ to report a 7 day earlier start of the growing season VBN on long‐term measurements of atmospheric CO 2 concentration , which Myneni , Keeling , Tucker , Asrar , and Nemani ( 1997 ) confirmed VBG normalized difference vegetation index satellite NNS from the Northern Hemisphere . Menzel and Fabian ( 1999 ) then provided the necessary ground truth by their analyses of long‐term European phenological NNS . JJ other papers , summarized in well ‐cited reviews and relevant chapters in IPCC reports ( e.g. Rosenzweig FW al. , 2007 ; Walther FW al. , 2002 ) , confirmed the extraordinary role of phenology as a bio‐indicator of NN NN . While research initially focused purely on the identification of NNS , it then extended to communication of NN NN to the general NN ( e.g. Van Vliet FW al. , 2003 ) as well as on various ecological consequences of these NNS ( Morisette FW al. , 2009 ; Thackeray FW al. , 2010 ) . Nevertheless , at the beginning of this renewed research there was a latent accusation of a publication bias , or cherry picking , in the sense that only the most advancing records or extraordinary NNS VBD their NN into popular scientific journals . Therefore , the COST725 initiative collected all available European phenological NNS ( later developed as the PEP725 database , Templ FW al. , 2018 ) and analysed more than 100,000 NN series for NN NN ‐driven NNS ( Menzel , Sparks , Estrella , Koch , FW al. , 2006 , hereafter referred as GCB2006 ) . The GCB2006 NN concluded that there was indeed a strong response in European phenology to NN NN and that these NNS matched the NN pattern . With more than 1,500 citations in the Web of NNP Core Collection , this NN has a high relevance for the scientific discourse on NN NN impacts on the biosphere . It was RB the backbone of the corresponding assessment of observed NNS and responses in natural and managed systems of AR4 WGII of the IPCC ( Rosenzweig FW al. , 2007 ) as well as of the subsequent paper of attribution of JJ impacts in nature to anthropogenic NN ( Rosenzweig FW al. , 2008 ) . Second , we applied a spatial approach VBN on all sites for which we tested the effect of the corresponding NN trends on all phenological trends . For this we divided all ( significant as well as non‐significant ) NN trends in terciles ( below , average , above ) on a seasonal basis and the phenological trends by sign and significance ( negative significant , negative nonsignificant , positive nonsignificant , positive significant ) . A frequency analysis was performed on this cross tabulation VBG Chi‐square tests and p ‐values were adjusted for multiple comparisons VBG the FDR . Pearson ( standardized ) residuals for each cell were determined to assess their relative contribution to the total Chi‐square score . Attribution followed the methods proposed by Rosenzweig FW al. ( 2007 , 2008 ) . RB , VBN on statistically significant trends only , the percentage of significant trends ( out of all significant trends ) matching the direction expected from NN NN was determined , both for the phenological groups of GCB2006 and of Update . According to IPCC likelihood terminology , > 66 % probability corresponds to ‘ likely ’ , > 90 % to ‘ very likely ’ , and > 95 % to ‘ extremely likely ’ . In the results section , the model coefficients are visualized VBG so ‐called effect plots , which plot the predicted effect of each explanatory variable on the outcome . This makes comparisons easier with respect to the JJ units and range of the explanatory variables , and allows the identification of interaction terms and smooth terms . The effect of each variable is calculated by holding all other variables constant ( except for interactions ) . The models were fitted in R statistical software version 3.6 VBG the mgcv‐package ( Wood , 2017 ) , effects were calculated VBG the emmeans ‐package ( Lenth , 2019 ) , and results were visualized VBG the ggplot2 ‐ package ( Wickham , CD ) . In order to understand what the partial contribution of explanatory factors to the observed phenological trend was , we followed a modelling approach . Explanatory factors / variables were the nine clusters ( cluster9 , VB Table 2 ) , topography ( longitude , latitude and elevation ) , traits ( woodiness , pollination mode ) , start NN of records and number of recorded NNS . A symbolic description of the generalized additive model ( composed of linear , nonlinear / smooth and factorial terms ) iswhere cluster9 , woodiness and pollination mode are factorial variables ( encoded as dummies in the model ) with levels indicated as above ( cluster9 ) , woody or nonwoody ( woodiness ) , wind or insect ( pollination mode ) ; all other variables are numeric ; start NN and number NNS were included as smooth functions ( denoted with prefix s ; VBG penalized splines ) ; all other numeric variables were included with linear coefficients ; interaction terms are denoted by *. Furthermore , the overall mean onset dates ( DOY mean ) and mean NN ( T mean ) over the whole NN period ( 1951 –2018 ) for each phenological series ( per NN / phase / station ) were calculated and aggregated in weeks to VB the phenological anomalies from the average . Every CD NN NN block ( 1950s , 1960s and so on ) was selected and the corresponding DOY mean and T mean were again calculated for the corresponding weeks of the NN . The deviations of DOY mean and T mean from the overall mean were considered as the phenological anomalies and 95 % confidence intervals for each week in each NN block were calculated . For each decade we VBD loess smoothing of the NN anomalies and inverted the y ‐axis for better visual comparison with the phenological anomalies . Phenological NNS were determined as linear regressions of onset days ( DOY ) against NN for all series ( i.e. 30 + NNS in Update ) . For GCB2006s ( 1971 –2000 ) , similar to GCB2006 , all 15 + NN series were considered . p values of the linear regression slopes were adjusted for multiple comparisons VBG the JJ ‐discovery‐rate ( FDR ; Benjamini & Hochberg , 1995 ) . Proportions of ( significant ) negative / ( significant ) positive trends and mean slopes ( Tr mean ) were determined for the JJ categories described in Table 2 . The uncertainty range of Tr mean is the 95 % confidence interval for estimating the mean ( of the slopes ) , and not the 95 % interval of the underlying NNS . Thus , the range is equivalent to the 95 % CI of a CD ‐sample t test . Trends were RB determined for moving 30 NN blocks over the whole NN period where 15 + NNS of valid NNS existed . The mean slope per category and 30 NN block was then calculated to assess the varying trend strength over NN . Daily mean NN ( T mean ) was extracted and processed into annual and seasonal averages ( DJF winter , MAM spring , JJA summer , SON autumn ) in order to calculate the respective linear annual and seasonal NN trends over the entire 1951 – 2018 NN period for Update VBN on the geographical coordinates of each phenological station . The E‐OBS v19.0HOM gridded NNS set with a 0.25 degree regular grid ( Cornes , Schrier , Besselaar , & Jones , 2018 ) , which is the homogenized version of E‐OBS v19.0e and thus more suitable to derive long‐term trends , was VBN for extracting the daily mean NN for all stations during 1951 – 2018 . It was additionally adjusted for station ‐specific elevation by VBG the elevation difference between the station and the average of the climatic grid cell derived from the JJ raster Digital Elevation Model , the JJ 30 Arc‐Second Elevation NN Set ( GTOPO30 ) together with E‐OBS v19.0HOM , VBN on a NN lapse rate of 6.4°C / km ( VB RB Ma FW al. , 2019 ; Olsson & Jönsson , 2014 ) . In the previous GCB2006 NN comprising ~ 100,000 series in the period 1971 –2000 plant phenological series were categorized into four groups ( VB Table 2 ) . For Update and GCB2006s , we further refined this categorization into nine clusters , taking into account BBCH coding of phases ( Meier , 1997 ) as well as farming activities , and additionally defined four periods / seasons , JJ from those in GCB2006 . It is important to notice that a direct comparison between GCB2006 and the updated results is not straightforward since some differences in phenophases and NN selection procedure exist . Thus a GCB2006s ( s = simulated ) NNS set was defined as a subset of Update containing identical NNS / phases / stations , but restricted to the GCB2006 period and series length ( 1971 –2000 , 15 + NNS ) . This simulation of GCB2006 conditions in Update allowed studying the effects of ongoing NN NN post ‐2000 as well as methodological aspects ( 15 + vs. 30 + NN series ) , when comparing Update and GCB2006s results . In contrast , GCB2006 results are only reported and discussed with respect to possible effects due to some JJ sites / phenophases in GCB2006s . For NN correction ( following e.g . Chen FW al. , 2018 , 2019 ; Ma , Huang , Hänninen , & Berninger , 2019 ; Vitasse , Signarbieux , & Fu , 2018 ) , we filtered out in each series those observations outside the range median ± 3.5 × MAD ( median absolute deviation ) , which is definitely a more than conservative approach ( VB Leys , Ley , Klein , Bernard , & Licata , 2013 ; Miller , 1991 ) , since only the extreme values considered absolutely wrong were excluded ( in our NN less than 0.7 % of the NNS ) . Out of the complete phenological NNS from these NNS , we took observational NNS between 1951 and 2018 with NN series ( series per NN / phase / station ) longer than 29 NNS and ending in or after 2000 . Duplicates were removed by averaging the respective DOYs ( onset dates as day of the NN ) in the same NN . Very early phenological events ( e.g. hazel or snowdrop flowering in December ) were allocated to the correct reference NN by negative DOYs . Unfortunately , it was not possible to directly update the GCB2006 NNS set due to a lack of access to the recent phenological NNS of specific NNS . However , NNS from Germany , Austria and Switzerland constituted RB 96.7 % of the GCB2006 NN set . Thus , it is justified to consider the JJ NNS set as comparable . Complete original plant phenological observation NNS were retrieved individually from the European Meteorological Services of Germany ( DWD ) , Austria ( ZAMG ) and Switzerland ( MeteoSwiss ) . NN of these NNS account for 96.3 % of the PEP database ( Templ FW al. , 2018 ) , thus our results are comparable to any other VBN on PEP725 NNS . However , these national phenological databases are richer in sites , NNS and phenophases ; therefore , although having a smaller spatial extent , are preferred for this NN ( VB map in Figure S1 a ) . Attribution of phenological trends for the nine clusters ( VB Table 2 ) to trends in seasonal NNS by Chi‐squared test ( absolute numbers are given in Figure S4 ) . Pearson residuals indicate the relative contribution of a cell to the total Chi‐square . Crossed out combinations were not significant ( ‐values adjusted for multiple comparisons of 4 * 9 = 36 tests by FDR ) . The size of the circle is proportional to the amount of the contribution , green indicates positive residuals , which specify a positive association between phenological and NN trends , and light grey implies a repulsion or negative association [ Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com Concerning the spatial match of NN trends to all phenological trends , results of the Chi‐square tests indicated that for all phenological clusters , except crop vegetative development in spring ( Cv sp ) as well as ripening phases of fruit trees and wild plant NNS in summer ( FWg su ) , there was at least CD significant association of phenological trends with seasonal NN patterns in winter / spring / summer ( Figure 5 ; Figure S4 ) . Crop generative development in spring ( Cg sp ) was significantly associated with winter and spring NN patterns , and the respective spring phases in fruit trees and wild plant NNS ( FWv sp , FWg sp ) RB displayed a stronger positive association ( VB Figure S4 ) . For the latter CD , counterintuitively average and above average summer NN trends were associated with delayed ( subsequent ) spring phenophases . Above average NN in winter and spring was significantly associated with delayed leaf colouring and leaf fall ( FWv au ) . For farmers ’ activities , the Chi‐square tests indicated that advancing spring activities ( F sp ) were significantly linked with above average NN in winter , but below average NN in summer . For farmers ’ summer activities , above average NN in summer and autumn was associated with advancing summer trends ( F su ) . In contrast , below average NN in summer was connected to advancing autumn activities ( F au ) . About 96 % and 95 % of the significant NNS of leaf unfolding and flowering ( b1 ) and fruit ripening ( b2 ) , respectively , were negative , thus indicating advancing onset dates with NN ( VB Table 3 ) . For farmers ’ activities , 83 % of the significant trends were negative . Significant leaf colouring and leaf fall trends ( b3 in Table 3 , FWv au in Table S1 a ) were 63 % positive , hinting to delayed autumn with NN . This pattern is confirmed by the corresponding analysis for the spring and summer clusters ( NNS from Table S1 a ) : 95 % , 98 % , 98 % , 98 % , 92 % and 91 % of their significant trends ( Cv sp , Cg sp , FWv sp , FWg sp , FWg su , F su ) were negative and matched the NN signal . Only 89 % and 78 % of the significant trends of farming activities in spring and autumn were advancing . Thus , advancing farming activities are likely , phenological phases in summer are very likely and phenological phases in spring , such as leaf unfolding and flowering , are RB extremely likely to be attributable to increasing NNS . Effect plots of the generalized additive model showing the predicted effect of each explanatory variable on the slope of phenological trends in Update . ( a ) Factorial variables of nine clusters and of selected plant NN traits with 95 % confidence intervals , ( b ) start NN and number of NNS as smooth functions with penalized splines with 95 % confidence intervals , ( c ) topographical variables interacting with phenological clusters Since phenological trends varied with phenological group ( Table 3 ) and cluster ( Figure 1 ) , NN ( Figure 2 ) , season ( Figure 3 ) and length of the series ( Table 3 ) , these variables , as well as geographical coordinates and NN traits , were VBN in the generalized additive model . The following reported values are model estimates , and their uncertainty relates to the uncertainty in estimating the model ( i.e. confidence intervals do not cover the variability of the NNS , but the uncertainty in estimating the mean values ) . The results ( Figure 4 ) indicate that all phenological clusters except leaf colouring and leaf fall ( FWv au ) exhibited negative trends of on average − 0.224 days / NN . Only farmers ’ activities had smaller negative trends : in spring − 0.126 days / NN ( 95 % CI : − 0.136 , − 0.116 ) and autumn − 0.128 days / NN ( −0.138 , − 0.118 ) . Flowering of fruit trees and wild plant NNS in spring , FWg sp , − 0.277 days / NN ( −0.284 , − 0.270 ) , and vegetative development of agricultural crops in spring , Cv sp , − 0.317 days / NN ( −0.328 , − 0.306 ) , had stronger trends . For NN traits , the models showed that nonwoody insect ‐pollinated NNS had smaller trends with − 0.150 days / NN ( −0.159 , − 0.142 ) than the other three combinations ( on average − 0.210 days / NN ) . There was no obvious effect of the length of the phenological series on trends . However , the start of the series mattered : Series starting at the end of the 1970s were linked to the strongest advancing trends , while earlier and later starting series were associated to less strong advancing trends . For JJ clusters there was a mixed effect of longitude on trends , and clear negative effects of latitude and elevation ; however , the largest impacts were seen for elevation . The average effect on phenological trends of latitude was − 0.010 days / NN per degree latitude and for elevation − 0.140 days / NN per km elevation , thus higher elevations were consistently associated with stronger advancing trends . This reverse order was equally apparent in mean weekly NN anomalies ( Figure S3 b ) where the 1991 –2000 decade exhibited the warmest weekly NNS and the 2011 –2018 decade the coldest ones , but from week 4 to 8 , thus 6 weeks prior to the leafing / flowering phenological response . In general anomalies in T mean varied more strongly from week to week mirroring the more fluctuating NN / NN ( Figure S3 b ) . For leaf colouring and fall ( FWv au ) the 1951 – 1960 decade had the earliest onset dates , thus , it is likely that the inclusion of this decade in Update ( 1951 –2018 ) triggered the now delaying autumn trends . Farmers ’ activities in spring and summer ( F sp , F su ) only exhibited earlier than average starting dates in the last and the CD last decades respectively . Mean decadal phenological anomalies across weeks of the NN ( Figures S2 and S3 a ) allow deeper insights into the trend structure . The spring and summer clusters ( uppermost five panels in Figure S3 a ) provide a text book example of NN NN ‐driven NNS in phenology : In the last four decades the weekly mean anomalies gradually decreased , whereas respective decadal anomalies of weekly mean NNS increased . Interestingly , during week CD – 13 the anomalies of leaf unfolding and flowering of fruit trees and wild plant NNS in spring ( FWv sp , FWg sp ) displayed a reverse order of the last three decades : 1991 –2000 had the earliest mean onset dates , 2011 –2018 the least early ones . Respective spring phases for crops ( Cv sp , Cg sp ) advanced more strongly than for fruit trees and wild plant NNS before week 20 and less strongly afterwards . In summer , from week 28 onwards , fruit ripening in fruit trees and wild plant NNS ( FWg su ) , as well as ripening of crops and harvest dates in agriculture ( F su ) , exhibited similar advancing trends . However , before that , in early summer ( week 22 to 28 ) , farmers ’ activities were more strongly advancing than contemporaneous ripening phases in FWg su . Farmers ’ activities in early autumn from mid‐August to end of September were almost unchanged , whereas in October a clear advancing response to NN was visible .

CIs exceeding the ‐axis range are not shown by default [ Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com Plotting mean trends over weeks of the NN ( Figure 3 ) clearly exhibits systematic variations with season . Only weeks covered by less NN points at the beginning or end of record had wider confidence intervals of the mean trends . In autumn , trends of delayed leaf colouring and leaf fall ( b3 in Figure 3 a , FWv au in Figure 3 b ) increased from week 36 to 47 , suggesting that sites or NNS with later senescence were delayed more . During the JJ 3 months of the NN ( week 4 – 12 ) , advance in flowering of JJ fruit trees and wild plant NNS ( FWg sp in Figure 3 b ) decreased distinctly , indicating that strongest advances in spring phenology were observed for early flowering NNS and / or very warm sites . The more detailed clusters show that the advance of leaf unfolding of fruit trees and wild plant NNS ( FWv sp in Figure 3 b ) was stable across the weeks 11 – 23 , matching those of FWg sp . Consequently , when adjusted for identical weeks in spring , there were no differences in trends between generative and vegetative phases . Quite clearly , these NNS in the intensity of phenological NNS overtime were related to NN NNS . Slopes of mean annual NN NN increased in NN till 1978 – 2007 ( +0.0582 ± 0.0004 °C / NN ) , and for the last block ( 1989 –2018 ) they only reached +0.0344 ± 0.0004 °C / NN ( Figure 2 d ) . This picture was RB JJ for all single seasons except autumn . The recorded NNS of the four periods ( GS , FWgP , FS , CgP ) differed substantially ( Figure 2 c ) . The growing season ( GS ) was clearly prolonged for all 30 NN periods ending after 1989 , exhibiting a maximum slope of +0.428 ± 0.016 days / NN for the period 1976 –2005 and a considerably smaller CD of +0.215 ± 0.017 days / NN for the final 30 NN block . The generative period of fruit trees and wild plant NNS ( FWgP ) showed almost no NNS in any direction , thus was stable across the NN period . The FS , defined as the period between JJ and last farmers ’ activities , and the crop generative period ( CgP ) were predominantly shortened for the 30 NN periods ending after 1989 , both reaching mean slopes of − 0.449 ± 0.048 and − 0.143 ± 0.038 days / NN , respectively , in the final 30 NN period . Mean slopes of linear trends ( Tr ) calculated for all 15 + NN phenological series in respective 30 NN moving window blocks within 1951 – 2018 for the Update NN set .

Until the end NN of 1988 slopes were stable and positive for most phenogroups ( Figure 2 a ) and clusters ( Figure 2 b ) indicating delayed onsets . Advancing onsets were only determined for some phenophases related to agriculture ( Cv sp , F sp , F au , i.e. development of crops in spring , sowing of spring crops and winter cereals ) . After the end NN of 1989 , slopes for leaf colouring and leaf fall ( b3 in Figure 2 a , FWv au in Figure 2 b ) oscillated IN zero , whereas for all other groups / clusters the trends were becoming more and more negative . The minimum slopes ( i.e. strongest advancing trends ) were reached IN 1979 –2008 and the most pronounced advancing mean trend of − 0.553 ± 0.004 days / NN was recorded for flowering phases of fruit trees and wild plant NNS in spring ( FWg sp ) . Afterwards , trends became weaker again , especially for spring leaf unfolding and flowering of fruit trees and wild plant NNS ( FWv sp , FWg sp ) . Finally , for the most recent 30 NN period ( 1989 –2018 ) they were all less than half of their maximum in the 1980s to 2010s although still negative ( Cv sp −0.214 ± 0.018 , Cg sp −0.237 ± 0.010 , FWv sp −0.098 ± 0.007 , FWg sp −0.080 ± 0.005 , FWg su − 0.232 ± 0.010 , F su − 0.179 ± 0.009 , F au − 0.075 ± 0.012 days / NN ) except for F sp ( +0.018 ± 0.013 days / NN ) . About 84 % of the series indicated a lengthening of the growing season ( GS , from leaf unfolding to colouring ) and 48 % were significantly longer ( Figure 1 b ) . The mean trend was +0.261 ± 0.008 days / NN . The farming season ( FS , period of farmers ’ activities from spring to autumn ) shortened by − 0.149 ± 0.022 days / NN with CD ‐thirds of the trends being negative . Although the generative period for agricultural crops ( CgP , from flowering to ripeness ) was definitively shortened ( −0.205 ± 0.019 days / NN , 78 % negative ) , there was no clear NN pattern for fruit trees and wild plants ( FWgP , from flowering to ripeness ; VB Table S1 b ) . The average trend was almost zero with roughly equal numbers of the series showing a shortening or lengthening of the generative period . Undoubtedly ~ 3/4 of the farmers ’ spring and summer activities ( F sp sowing of spring cereals , F su harvest ) were advancing ( 74 % and 84 % , respectively ) and the percentages of significant advances clearly increased from GCB2006s to Update ( 14% –31 % and 24%–53 % , respectively ) . For farmers ’ sowing of autumn crops ( F au ) , more advanced than delayed series were observed ; however , the picture was still similar to GCB2006s except that more trends ( both advances and delays ) were significant ( Figure 1 a ; Table S1 a ) . Surprisingly , mean slopes became less negative , except for F sp which advanced more strongly in Update than in GCB2006s ( −0.116 ± 0.005 vs. − 0.075 ± 0.011 days / NN ) .

Except for FWv au which comprises leaf colouring and fall in fruit trees and wild NNS in autumn , the overall NN pattern in all other clusters was advancing . All spring and summer clusters had higher percentages of negative and significant negative trends in Update than in GCB2006s ( Figure 1 a ) , for example , ~ 90 % of the four NN ‐driven spring categories ( Cv sp , Cg sp , FWv sp , FWg sp ) advanced ( 86 % , 90 % , 92 % and 91 % , respectively ) , up to 60 % significantly . Interestingly , for ripening in fruit trees and wild NNS in summer ( FWg su ) , the percentage was slightly smaller with 81 % ( 46 % significantly ) advanced , although this pattern RB intensified from GCB2006s to Update . In contrast , the mean slopes of the spring and summer phenological groups ( Cv sp , Cg sp , FWv sp , FWg sp and FWg su ) very clearly indicated throughout smaller advances in Update than in GCB2006s . This decrease in trend strength was RB quite JJ , for example , − 0.428 ± 0.004 days / NN for FWg sp in GCB2006s compared to only − 0.254 ± 0.002 days / NN in Update ( Figure 1 c ; Table S1 a ) . For leaf unfolding and flowering , fruiting and farmers ’ activities , the percentage of negative trends slightly increased , for example from 87 % ( GCB2006s ) to 89 % advanced for leaf unfolding and flowering ( Table 3 ) . The percentage of expected , delayed trends for leaf colouring increased from 49 % ( GCB2006s ) to 57 % . Longer ( 30 + NNS ) series led to considerably higher proportions of significantly advancing trends ( e.g. 54 % of leaf unfolding and flowering series compared to 30 % in GCB2006s ) . While GCB2006 as well as GCB2006s indicated a less clear pattern for both farmers ’ activities and leaf colouring , the direction of NNS was more obvious in Update with farmers ’ activities being mostly advanced ( 72 % ) and leaf colouring predominantly delayed ( 57 % ) . Though the phenological NN signal in terms of the proportion of significant trends increased , the mean advance in days per NN was considerably weaker than in GCB2006s . For example , the mean slope for leaf unfolding and flowering was – 0.394 ± 0.003 days / NN ( 95 % confidence intervals ) in GCB2006s and only − 0.240 ± 0.002 days / NN in Update . The update of the GCB2006 NN almost CD decades later has clearly revealed that there is still a significant NN NN pattern in European plant phenology . Since a direct comparison of the almost 97,000 Update series to the GCB2006 ones was not possible , we simulated GCB2006s results VBN on Update to VB the effects of ongoing NN NN after 2000 as well as of longer series ( 15 + vs. 30 + NNS ) . Differences in the trend structure of GCB2006 and GCB2006s suggested that any results of trends analyses MD RB partly be driven by the set of NNS and phenophases included . In our NN a considerable adjustment in the observational programme of the DWD in 1991 has led to a substantial reduction in the number of ( agricultural ) NNS / phases when series were selected to end in 2000 or later . ZAMG NN selection mirrors a similar decrease of observations in the last CD decades ( VB Figure S1 b ) . In the following the results will be discussed with respect to the three guiding research questions . There is still a clear picture of phenological advance except for autumn . For the vegetative and generative phases of crops , fruit trees and wild plants , longer NN series ( 30 + NNS in Update ) led to ≥90 % advancing trends in spring ( Cg , FWv , FWg ) , ≥ 81 % for Cv and FWg , and ~ 75 % for the farmers ’ activities in these seasons ( F , F ) . Accordingly , at least 30 + NN series are needed for robust trend estimations ( Dose & Menzel , 2004 ; Rosenzweig FW al. , 2007 ) as RB confirmed by our trend modelling . Longer series were RB linked to a higher percentage of significant trends , but assuming comparable variability and NN rates , greater statistical NN MD be expected to lead to an increase in significance . Although the proportion of trends that was significant increased , mean advances of spring and summer phases decreased in the extended period beyond 2000 , especially for fruit trees and wild plants , but RB to a lesser degree for crops . This confirms findings of a review by Piao FW al. ( 2019 ) of decelerated or RB reversed trends in recent NNS . Only farmers ’ spring activities exhibited a stronger advance ( −0.116 ± 0.005 days / NN ) in Update which is well explained by considerably earlier dates in 2011 –2018 as shown in the anomaly plots . It was not the aim of our paper to disentangle the contribution of the obvious reasons for this result , but the moving window approach clearly showed that spring and winter NN trends exhibited very similar variation overtime , that is , the strongest trends in the 1980 – 2010 period . Thus , it is more likely that a reduction in forcing conditions has driven the decrease in the advance of spring and summer phenology ( as reported by Güsewell FW al. , 2017 for Switzerland ) than a lack of chilling ( e.g. Fu , Zhao , FW al. , 2015 ) . Nevertheless , there are differences in this decreased sensitivity of NN with leaf unfolding and flowering of fruit trees and wild plant NNS exhibiting the strongest decline in trend strength . In autumn , leaf colouring and fall trends now predominantly ( 57 % ) indicated delayed onset dates with a mean positive trend . However since 1951 – 1960 was characterized by earlier mean onset dates , it has to be checked whether a prolongation of the records into the past ( 1951 –1970 ) might have driven this result . In contrast , farmers ’ activities in autumn were still advancing , but to a lesser degree , although the percentage of advancing trends slightly decreased . To conclude , any NNS in leaf colouring and fall dates are still not well understood . With ongoing NN NN , more heat and drought extremes , such as in 2003 , 2015 and 2018 , in conjunction with biotic disturbances might lead to premature leaf senescence interfering with correct observation of autumn phenophases . There was still a lengthening of the growing season of ~ 0.26 days / NN and this lengthening only marginally decreased in the most recent decade confirming JJ other studies ( e.g. Kolářová , Nekovář , & Adamík , 2014 ) . In this respect our paper disagrees with the findings of Chen FW al. ( 2019 ) , likely because NNS other than trees were RB incorporated in our spring signal . In contrast , the FS was shortened by − 0.15 days / NN due to a smaller advancing trend in farmers ’ spring activities than in the development of wild plant NNS , matching the previous findings of Estrella FW al. ( 2007 ) . In principle , farmers themselves should profit from this earlier start of the ( abiotic ) growing season , RB by VBG more cold tolerant cultivars of maize and summer cereals , but according to Parker , Shonkwiler , and Aurbacher ( 2017 ) this advance is buffered by still severe minimum NNS . Equally , crop ripening and harvest ( F ) MD RB be partially triggered by the choice of early versus late ‐maturing cultivars ( Peltonen ‐Sainio & Jauhiainen , 2014 ) , explaining the shortened crop generative period . The NN of phenology by seasonal NN patterns ( Lapenis FW al. , 2014 ) leads to a variation in the phenological signal over NN , with NN of the NN , site and elevation . Our results , for nearly all phases , match findings of stronger advancing trends at higher elevations ( e.g. Ziello , Estrella , Kostova , Koch , & Menzel , 2009 ) resulting , for example , in a more uniform spring across elevations ( Vitasse FW al. , 2018 ) . Across the seasons the strongest advances in spring phenology were observed for early flowering NNS and / or very warm sites . Modelling clearly confirmed differential advances : Farmers ’ activities in spring and autumn only advanced at half of the rate , whereas ripening phases and especially crop vegetative phases in spring advanced more than the mean rate of ~ 0.22 days / NN . It is important to notice that spring development of winter cereals is ( at least ) comparable to that of fruit trees and wild NNS . Nonwoody and insect‐pollinated plant NNS advanced less than wind ‐pollinated NNS , which was RB VBN in the western Mediterranean ( Gordo & Sanz , 2009 ) . Advancing trends reached their maximum rates when starting at ~ 1978 , a finding which corresponds to the reported 1980s regime shift ( Reid FW al. , CD ) . Although the NN pattern varied over NN , the ( still ) advancing trends MD be attributed to NN . More specifically , VBN on percentages of significant trends matching the NN , advancing farming activities are likely , ripening phases in summer are very likely and phenological spring phases , such as leaf unfolding and flowering , are very or extremely likely to mirror the increasing NNS . The spatial approach confirmed this attribution , however , to a lesser degree . Seasonal NN was significantly associated with spring phases ’ advance in fruit trees and wild plant NNS , generative phases in crops as well as farmers ’ activities mirroring winter and spring NN ( descending order , F not with spring NN ) . Advancing farmers ’ summer activities clearly mirrored summer and autumn NN patterns . The association in autumn was reversed with below average NN in winter and spring being linked to advanced leaf colouring and fall ( VB equally Estrella & Menzel , 2006 ; Zohner & Renner , 2019 ) and less NN in summer being linked to advanced farmers ’ autumn activities . Most interestingly , what has been described as carry ‐over effects ( Sparks , Buras , Estrella , & Menzel , 2020 ; Zohner & Renner , 2019 ) , is depicted by this attribution analysis , where below average NN in summer was linked to advancing phenological trends in spring ( FWv , FWg , F ) . Thus , formal attribution of phenological trends does not only shape a formal fingerprint in nature , but additionally fosters a deeper understanding of the drivers . The results of the updated NN are relevant in a number of ways . A stronger advance of early spring wind ‐pollinated NN leads to an earlier start of the allergenic pollen season . Citizen NNS can still observe NN NN in their backyard and these spring advances including a lengthening of the growing season are to a JJ extent attributable to NN , although our refined analysis on nine clusters showed the superiority of fruit trees and wild NNS in this respect . A tricky question to be investigated in the future is why summer ripening phases of fruit trees and wild NNS do not mirror any NN pattern , whereas summer harvesting in agriculture does . Our results clearly underline that farmers ’ decisions ( weaker trends and smaller trend NNS in spring and autumn ) MD be driven by other factors as well , although farmers seem to respond / adapt since their activities in spring were the only phase to exhibit stronger advancing trends in Update . A shortening of the crop generative period MD have undesired consequences for yield , but will allow more intercropping or earlier sowing of winter cereals . Results of our comprehensive analysis of the complete plant phenological NNS set in these three Central European NNS underline that the ecological consequences of these NNS are challenging to be assessed due to inherent variation of NNS over NN , season , with topography and plant traits , but this variation does not hamper NN NN attribution ."

Overall , we 're running quite close to the projections made in 2000 for NN dioxide concentration , JJ NN and NN level , Henson VBD . Here 's a look at NN NN indicators for 2020 : NN dioxide is the NN gas that NNS VBP is most responsible for JJ NN . Since the early 1990s , the NN dioxide level in the NNP 's atmosphere has jumped from about 358 parts per CD to nearly 412 ppm , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . That ’s a 15 % rise in 27 NNS . More : CD NNS to save NN NNP : Here are 6 imaginative NN NN solutions Since 1992 , the JJ NN level has risen on average 2.9 millimeters a NN . That ’s a total of 78.3 millimeters , according to NOAA . Penn NNP NNP meteorologist Michael Mann argued that we underestimated the rate of NN sheet collapse , which has "" implications for future sea- level rise . "" Both of the NN 's giant NN sheets have lost tremendous amounts of NN in the past CD to three decades : The Greenland NN sheet lost 5.2 trillion tons of NN from 1993 to 2018 , according to a NN in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

"" Since 1993 , there have been 212 NN disasters that cost the NNP NNPS at least $ 1 CD each , when adjusted for inflation . In total , they cost $ 1.45 trillion and killed more than 10,000 NNS . That ’s an average of 7.8 such disasters per NN since 1993 , compared with 3.2 per NN from 1980 to 1992 , according to NOAA . "" Just as NN models almost certainly underestimate the impact NN NN has already had on such NN extremes , projections from these models RB likely underestimate future increases in these types of events , "" Mann wrote in The NNP Post last NN . “ By and JJ , our models have gotten it RB , plus or minus a little bit , ” VBD Zeke Hausfather , a NNP of California - Berkeley scientist . Report : NN NN is damaging the NN of the NN 's NNS and threatens lifelong impact Henson noted it 's clear that JJ NN models were on the JJ track 20 NNS ago : JJ NNS MD continue to rise as NN gases continued to accumulate in the atmosphere . That 's been borne out : The JJ average NN rose a tad more than a degree Fahrenheit since the mid-'90s , according to NOAA . "" The JJ NN projections were just about on the NN , "" Mann VBD . More on JJ NN : You just lived through the warmest decade on record – and it's VBG to VB hotter These NN models were n't designed to predict decade - by - decade variability , Henson VBD , so we did n't fully anticipate the slowdown in JJ atmospheric NN in the JJ decade of this century and the much more rapid increase in the 2010s , both of which were linked to the evolving rate of heat storage in the ocean . The annual average extent of Arctic NN NN has shrunk from 4.7 CD square NNS in 1992 to 3.9 CD square NNS in 2019 , according to the National Snow and NNP NNP Center . That ’s a 17 % decrease . "" Another thing beyond the scope of NN - 2000 outlooks were some aspects of regional NN NN , "" Henson VBD . "" For example , it 's now clear that droughts in California are much more likely to be ' hot ' droughts , and this has laid the groundwork for longer , more devastating wildfire seasons .

For example , when an asteroid hit the NNP 66 CD NNS ago , the resulting dinosaur extinction led mammals to take their place . My colleagues and I have published JJ research on the mass extinction that took place 359 CD NNS ago at the boundary between the Devonian and Carboniferous geological periods . There have been JJ previous speculations as to the NN of this event , including volcanic eruptions , asteroid impacts , NN NN , NN level NNS , wildfires and the rise of the JJ forests . But we have shown that the extinctions on land at this NN MD have been caused by a catastrophic thinning of the ozone layer that let in damaging levels of ultra-violet radiation . Something similar contributed to the mass extinctions at the end of the Permian and Triassic periods , but these events were caused by volcanic eruptions . Our research suggests the NNP has a natural internal process triggered by a VBG NN that can destroy the ozone layer , a serious warning for our own period of NN NN . The Late Devonian extinction played a significant role in the development of vertebrate NN . It included the loss of the dominant group of armoured freshwater fish . The survivors were the sharks and the rather minor group of bony fish that subsequently spread out to dominate our younger oceans . The event RB shaped our own evolution because it led to the extinction of the JJ four - legged “ tetrapods ” . These were “ fish ” whose fins had evolved to become limbs with between six and eight fingers and toes . The JJ land - dwelling tetrapods with five fingers and toes – our ancestors – do n’t appear in the fossil record until after this extinction . To find out exactly what caused the Late Devonian extinction , we looked for NN of what happened in the atmosphere that was captured by fossilised plants from before and after the event . In particular , we looked at the resistant walls of the microscopic remains of pollen and spores , taken from fossils VBN in East Greenland and released by dissolving the rock samples in acid . The resistant walls of spores and pollen are there to protect the cell contents from ultra-violet radiation . But there is a brief interval between the creation of a JJ cell and the formation of its protective wall when it is vulnerable . The kinds of spores we examined are covered in JJ spines that are normally identical in length and have perfectly pointed tips . But most of the spines in our samples were malformed in a wild variety of shapes , suggesting the DNA of their cells was damaged by ultra-violet radiation . This suggests that the NNP ’s protective ozone shield was down as the spores were formed . Other spores and pollen had pigmented walls that acted as a protective tan , enabling those plants to survive . But a number of important plant groups quickly became extinct and the forest ecosystem collapsed . Those groups that survived were still disrupted and it took several CD NNS to rebuild , creating quite a JJ ecosystem in the process . Our samples came from a very JJ ancient lake that existed all NN round despite being in a very arid part of the NN . Such lakes only form when glaciers collapse and the NN ’s seasonal monsoon is very active due to solar heat , so the JJ NN must have been in a NN period . Other NNS have shown that high summer NNS over continental areas can increase the transport of NN vapour high into the atmosphere . This NN vapour carries with it organic NN compounds that include chlorine , which are produced naturally by a wide variety of plants , algae and fungi . Once these compounds are near the ozone layer , they release the chlorine and this breaks down ozone molecules . This produces a positive feedback loop because a collapsing terrestrial ecosystem will release a flush of nutrients into the oceans , which can VB a rapid increase in algae . So the more the ozone layer is damaged , the more plants die , and the more ozone - damaging compounds are released . Later on , the ozone layer will naturally recover as the NN cools and the algae helps remove NN dioxide from the atmosphere . The discovery of this potential JJ extinction mechanism indicates that a NN NN , such as we have now , has the potential to erode the ozone layer to let in damaging ultra-violet radiation . This has consequences for all NN on NNP , both on the land and in shallow waters . We VBP it is as important as recognising that asteroid impacts caused mass extinctions . Once we knew about the consequences of asteroid impacts , there followed an intense collective research effort to assess the threat . We now plot the paths of all JJ extra-terrestrial objects likely to come close to the NNP ’s orbit . Similarly , we now VBP to focus effort on understanding the links between JJ NN and the production and atmospheric transport of chlorine - bearing NN compounds that have the potential to VB similar destruction of our ozone layer . We now VBP to make further studies of the rocks with malformed spores to work out the duration of the extinction and the likely rate of NN NN required to push enough ozone - destroying chemicals high into the atmosphere . We RB VBP to do ultra-violet malformation experiments on living fern - IN plants which have spiny spores ."

Over the last century , the average NN NN of the NNP has increased by about 1.0o F . The eleven warmest NNS this century have all occurred since 1980 , with 1995 the warmest on record . The higher latitudes have warmed more than the equatorial regions . Beginning in 1979 , satellites have been VBN to measure the NN of the atmosphere up to a height of 30,000 NNS . The JJ - term NN record and the recent satellite observations differ , but that fact is not surprising : the CD techniques measure the NN of JJ parts of the NNP NN ( the NN , and various layers of the atmosphere ) . In addition to this , a variety of factors , such as the presence of airborne materials from the 1991 eruption of the volcano Mt. Pinatubo , affect each record in a JJ NN . Satellite observations were initially interpreted as showing a slight cooling , but more recent analyses accounting for natural , short - term fluctuations imply NN , just as the ground - VBN measurements have indicated over a longer NN period . As more NNS from the satellite record become available , and as the quality of measurements is improved , comparison of these CD records should yield additional insights . What does NN do ? A warmer NNP speeds up the JJ NN cycle : the exchange of NN among the oceans , atmosphere , and land . Higher NNS VBP more evaporation , and soils will tend to dry out faster . Increased amounts of NN in the atmosphere will mean more rain or snow overall . We MD be seeing the JJ signs of NNS in the NN cycle . Since the beginning of the century , precipitation in the NNP NNPS has increased by about 6 percent , while the frequency of intense precipitation events ( heavy downpours of more than CD inches per day ) has increased by 20 percent . Such events can VB flooding , soil erosion , and RB loss of NN . In some midcontinental areas , increased evaporation has led to drought because the heavy rains fell elsewhere . There is RB NN that ecosystems are reacting to NN . Between 1981 and 1991 , the length of the growing season in the northern high latitudes ( between 45 oand 70o N ) increased by a total of up to twelve days , as documented by satellite imagery . Greening in spring and summer occurred up to eight days earlier , and vegetation continued to photosynthesize an estimated four days longer . JJ mean NN level has risen 4 to CD inches over the last 100 NNS , mainly because NN expands when heated . The melting of glaciers , which has occurred worldwide over the last century , RB contributes to the rise . Formerly frozen soils ( permafrost ) in the Alaskan and Siberian arctic have RB begun to melt , damaging both ecosystems and infrastructure . Melting and tundra NN will RB lead to decay of organic matter and the release of trapped NN and methane , creating an additional source of NN gases ."

There are CD factions of evil fighting for the soul of humanity . Both are old and shrouded in secrecy . Both have complex networks of intelligence that have agents in every major bank and JJ NN group in the NN . Both encircle the globe and have centuries of fraud , corruption and murder on their hands . It is fair to VB that if you are reading this , from any place on the NNP , you are deeply affected by the evil machinations of these CD rival forces . Surprisingly enough , they work so closely together that you might not notice the battle raging RB before your eyes . JJ NN theorists point in the direction of these CD groups that are led by a “ NN in black ” and a “ NN in white . ” Before Christmas CD , the final steps toward Armageddon will be made by both of these groups and the fate of humanity depends on making sure that neither group is able to carry out their plan of hegemony – NN dominion under CD rulers who govern the religious ( cultural ) , judicial ( legal ) , and JJ ( JJ ) aspects of the globe . The NNP NNP Order , CD NNP Order , or the Transnational Globalist Republic is only a few steps away . The traces of those plans lead to Jerusalem and the bid for NN over the land where Armageddon is predicted to take place . VB All Roads Lead to Armageddon . “ While the NN starves , burns , and descends further into chaos , we should realize that this NN ’s Christmas celebrations for those who choose to celebrate it MD be their last . Francis I “ We are close to Christmas . There will be lights , there will be parties , bright trees , RB Nativity scenes – all decked out – while the NN continues to wage NN . It ’s all a charade . The NN has not understood the NN of peace . The whole NN is at NN . RB today , after the second failure of another NN NN , perhaps PRP can speak of a third NN , CD fought piecemeal , with crimes , massacres , destruction . ” Francis I During the filming of the annual Christmas Message for the BBC , December 26 , 2015 , the Queen VBD , There are CD Popes “ I have the authority of the King of kings . I am all in all and above all , so that NNP , Himself and I , The Vicar of NNP , have but CD consistory , and I am able to do almost all that NNP can do . What therefore , can you make of me but NNP . ” Pope Boniface VIII , The Bull Sanctum , 11/18/1302 . Not JJ NNS understand that there are CD popes : CD that we VBP on official occasions at the Vatican , dressed in his white ceremonial robes surrounded by his cadre of cardinals , priests , and clergy . This office is currently held by Francis 1 . The black pope , who is rarely seen , is the General Superior of the Society of Jesus , aka , the Jesuits . This office is currently held by Adolfo Nicolas who lives in the Vatican in the Jesuit headquarters . This position was held originally by the Jesuit founder Ignatius of Loyola . Generally speaking , the White Pope has always been about centralized NN in Rome IN a central hierarchy , canon law , and a central bank . The Jesuits , on the other hand , have always been about the ideas of liberation theology , decentralized NN through the Black Pope and his tentacles throughout the NN – ostensibly the best intelligence network ever in operation , along with the schools that provide the indoctrination into Jesuit socialism and theocratic communism . The White Pope in Rome working through bankers , whether the original central banks of Venice , Genoa , and Florence , or the Jewish NN bankers IN the Rothschild family , manipulate JJ allegiances that lead to continuous NN . Banks were created in Italian to fund these wars , especially the crusades . As we have explained in our article on the NNP - Industrial Complex , NN was lucrative business for the church and the bankers . Christians went off to the Holy Land to defend the “ land that Jesus walked upon ” and keep the roads open to pilgrims coming to the sacred sites of Palestine , especially Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre . When this church was torn down by Muslims , it became the spark that ignited crusade after crusade where millions lost their lives as the wealth of Europe was grabbed by the Catholic Church through the Templars and Italian bankers . JJ pilgrims started in Venice where the city provided ships , arms , goods , and a place to hold the pilgrim ’s wealth against the attacks of the Muslims on the road to Jerusalem . The Templars had castles and fortresses along the NN and banks where you MD do business to redeem your wealth on the roads to the Holy Land . In Europe , the Pope received the lands and wealth of the nobles VBG off to crusades . The Vatican funded and manipulated the wealth of the nobility to its own aims . The Knights Hospitaller , the Templars , and JJ other JJ and pseudo - JJ orders arose to channel the nobility into NN for the Vatican . The Vatican wants Jerusalem . This battle has never ceased . The battle still rages today and JJ are VBN in the play of Biblical narratives that use Jerusalem as the focal point . The Vatican lusts for Jerusalem , the Jesuits worship Jerusalem and of Christ and the Queen of England owns JJ parts of Jerusalem , including the Temple Mount . All three faiths of “ the book ” VBP Jerusalem , the Jews and the Palestinians both VBP Jerusalem , and the location of the NNP of Armageddon is near Jerusalem . Because of the critical role Jerusalem plays , we it is set to become the home of a “ CD NN NN ” that combines religious , judicial , and JJ branches into a “ JJ corporation ” that unites all nations . We can VB that the scenario is prepared for the NNP of Armageddon . In Syria , Gog and Magog , NNP and NNP are amassing on the borders of “ Greater Israel . ” This is unprecedented and seen as the fulfillment of the prophecies of the Book of Revelations . JJ nations are battling for Jerusalem as Iran , Iraq and JJ other Muslim nations conspire to destroy Israel . The Muslims VBP their Messiah is near and that is why Syria is being destroyed . The Jews await their messiah anxiously to VB them build the third temple . Christians anxiously await the return of Christ in Jerusalem . The Jesuits literally VBP the Book of Revelation and they VBP the NN is now to bring the physically reincarnated Jesus Christ to Jerusalem as the King of Jerusalem . Along these lines they have already “ anointed ” Juan Carlos as the King of Jerusalem ( thus RB his heir Felipe VI ) . The CEO of the Catholic Church , the White Pope The White Pope is the CEO of the Catholic Church and has always VBN “ other banks ” to provide interest on NN because the church at CD NN condemned ( now just disapproves ) usury . The Knights of Malta are CD remnant of an age old NN of banking and wealth controlled through the White Pope and the Vatican Bank . When we VBP pictures of White Pope Francis with the Knights of Malta , we can no longer be naïve that they are a charity organization that just happens to dress up in JJ outfits , complete with swords . The White Pope and the Knights of Malta are completely corrupt , all the while parading as a charity . There is another group that is within and above the Knights of Malta called the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem who are sworn to defend the White Pope RB above the famous French Guard . Now we are at the very apex of the pyramid structure . King Juan Carlos I of Spain and his heir Felipe VI are protectors of the Jesuits and they ( Carlos or his son ) are head of the Equestrian Order . Keep in NN that the Jesuits and the Knights of Malta have fought over the island of Malta for centuries . CD factions . CD island . But not just any island , CD that represents NN of the entire NN order . Juan Carlos is a Jesuit through and through as the head of the Order of Calatrava . His Merovingian NN lineage names him as “ holy NN ” from the fabled “ wondrous NN ” that was born to Mary Magdalene and carried to France with Mary ( the Mother of Jesus ) and the other Mary ( her sister ) . If legend is JJ , Juan Carlos I and Felipe VI are heirs of Jesus of Nazareth and hold the title of King of Jerusalem . The King of Spain is RB head of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and Juan Carlos is the NNP of the Organization of Ibero - NNP NNPS . The Ibero - NNP Union , which includes the European Union , of which the NNP Kingdom is a member , includes 700 CD NNS in Europe , the Mediterranean and South NNP . : Carlos and Felipe ’s cousins Prince Phillip , Prince Charles and his son William , who is to be crowned King of England this summer , hold the same claim to being the King of Jerusalem . The Windsors claim to be the JJ Monarchs of Europe ( European Union ) and Jerusalem through Merovingian NN lines with the protection of the Knights of Malta and the Vatican through the White Pope . Yet the Juan Carlos line claims the same title as King of Jerusalem through the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre . The Windsors work with the White Pope Francis I through the Knights of Malta . So who does Juan Carlos works through ? There is RB a JJ twist to this age old battle for NN in that White Pope Francis I is a Jesuit . : This is the JJ NN in history that the Pope was RB a Jesuit . “ The Jesuits have a vow to obey the pope , but if the pope is a Jesuit , maybe he should have a vow to obey the superior general of the Jesuits … I feel IN I ’m still a Jesuit in terms of my spirituality , what I have in my heart . ” Francis I Thus , it appears the Jesuits have won the centuries ’ old battle between the Jesuits ( and the Black Pope ) and the Knights of Malta ( and the White Pope ) . In Pope Francis we have both . Almost . But Adolfo Nicolas is still the Black Pope and head of the Society of Jesus . Unless … … something happens IN : Fr. General Nicolás Will Convoke GC 36 and Intends to Retire The Jesuit Black Pope is scheduled to “ step down ” sometime in CD . This will open the stage for CD of the last steps of the plan to Armageddon . What Happens When the White Pope Becomes the Black Pope ? It MD only seem logical for the Vatican to announce sometime soon that they will unify the CD pope positions and create the JJ all - in - CD pope that combines both streams . This is another reason why Pope Benedict XVI had to retire ! The plan was set in motion RB ago . Popes serve until they die . Benedict and Nicolas will be some of the only popes in history — either white or black — who left their office before death . : CHECK MATE . The centuries ’ JJ battle in the Catholic Church between White and Black will soon be over and the Jesuits are positioned for NN domination . What we should all be watching for is the next step : The White Pope Francis I will be elected the JJ Jesuit Black Pope . The White and Black Popes will combine for the JJ NN in history . We might VB that there will be a “ Grey Pope ” who will combine the work of the White and the Black Popes into CD job , CD agenda , CD NN plan to try and fulfill the apocalyptic predictions of the NNP of Armageddon and the return of Jesus in a physical body to conquer Jerusalem and rule the NN . The JJ Gray Pope will move to Jerusalem to lead a NNP Council of Churches that governs the “ free ” realm of religious belief and practice and its implications in the JJ sphere . He can already hear in the White Pope ’s words what he has planned and is preaching openly : “ Jesus Christ , Jehovah , Allah . These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the NN . For centuries , NN has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths . This , however , should be the very concept which unites us as NNS , as nations , and as a NN bound by faith . Together , we can bring about an unprecedented age of peace , all we VBP to achieve such a NN is respect each other ’s beliefs , for we are all NNS of NNP regardless of the name we choose to address him by . We can accomplish miraculous things in the NN by merging our faiths , and the NN for such a movement is now . ” Francis I The White Pope wants to merge all religions and kill the Catholic Church as we VBP Her . He is transitioning to a NNP Church where all beliefs are equal and the same . All religions will be merged into a grey religious JJ NN order headed by the JJ Gray Pope . Francis will be the head of this church and Jerusalem will be its JJ home . The Last Christmas Was Announced That is why Francis and others have spoken VBN publicly that Christmas 2015 was the last Christmas . “ While the NN starves , burns , and descends further into chaos , we should realize that this NN ’s Christmas celebrations for those who choose to celebrate it MD be their last . ” Francis I NN : Pope NNP This is the Last Christmas . As we hear the uncertainty in his words , “ MD be their last ” , we can only wonder what he means . Perhaps there will be no Christmas because there will be no Christianity , per se . Perhaps a CD NNP Religion will become the only accepted practice and all others are mere earlier stages of this JJ amalgamated religion . Francis seems quite dramatic about the “ end of days ” that he speaks about so often . He RB believes that a NNP NNP III has already begun and that he is the JJ Judge of all that is JJ and good for the entire globe , no matter what religion , country , or race . But did n’t the Queen of England RB VB that 2015 MD be the final Christmas , too ? NN : Queen VBZ 2015 Will Be Final Christmas . The Redistribution Agenda of the Gray Pope ? The Gray Pope will be a common Pope of all NNS who rules the NN through his JJ and JJ programs that raise the poor up out of the sin of poverty . What Francis does n’t mention is who is VBG to pay for this . He rails against poverty as the springboard for NN - wide JJ reform , led by his holiness . “ Inequality is the root of JJ evil . ” Francis I “ A contribution to this equitable development will RB be made both by international activity aimed at the integral JJ development of all the NN ’s peoples and by the legitimate redistribution of JJ benefits by the NNP , as well as indispensable cooperation between the private sector and civil society . ” Francis I We have heard Francis I call for redistribution of the wealth to raise the poor to an “ equal ” status with the now wealthy . This type of rhetoric is beautiful but impractical if not impossible to manifest . This “ Theocratic Socialism ” is another name for the Liberation Theology of the Jesuits . It is a type of “ socialist communism ” ran by the church , or more specifically , the Jesuits in the church . When the White Pope Francis I becomes the Black Pope , the Jesuits have won the battle . Theocratic Socialism , instead of democratic monarchies will rule . CD Pope , CD religion , CD NN order of Jesuit inspired socialism will govern from the Holy Land and redistribute the remaining wealth of the NN ( aka , any wealth the Jesuits do n’t VB already ) . The old wealth of monarchies and insider intelligence groups IN the Knights of Malta , the Pilgrim Society , the Bilderbergs , Trilateralists , Warlord Bankers and offshore tax havens will all collapse as the JJ regime of theocratic socialism run by Transnational globalists dissolve the JJ wealth of the criminal activities of mafias , royalty , and rich that has accumulated over hundreds of NNS . The old wealth of the Catholic Church itself will be dissolved as the JJ center of the religious NN becomes Jerusalem . It is very likely that the Gray Pope will rule from the Temple Mount in a temple that will fulfill the prophecies of a third Jewish temple . But there will have to be strong international legal ( courts ) and JJ ( JJ ) components of this plan for NN hegemony and Francis I has already named the organization that will carry out his JJ plans . In his recent visit to the NNP Nations earlier this NN ( CD ) he VBD : “ Consequently , while encouraging you [ the NNP Nations ] in your continuing efforts to coordinate the activity of the international agencies , which represents a service to all humanity , I urge you to work together in promoting a JJ , worldwide ethical mobilization which , beyond all differences of religious or JJ convictions , will spread and put into practice a shared ideal of fraternity and solidarity , especially with regard to the poorest and those most excluded . ” Francis I This type of “ fraternity and solidarity ” between the rich and the poor has been the NN of countless wars . There will be no leveling of wealth without dramatic JJ , JJ , and JJ intervention . The rich will not join the CD NNP Religion if it means loosing wealth . This battle has been waged for some NN and is now at a fever ’s pitch . “ The NN has not understood the NN of peace . The whole NN is at NN . RB today , after the second failure of another NN NN , perhaps PRP can speak of a third NN , CD fought piecemeal , with crimes , massacres , destruction . ” Francis I Pope Francis is in a NN , a battle between white and black – charity and dominion . He believes that by taking away all of the guns and weapons in the NN , he MD demand peace between all nations . Steps IN the NNP Nations NNP Arms Treaty are along the lines that Francis recommends . Take away the weapons , make all religions the same , and institute CD NN NN . And as we have seen , the NNP Nations is the chosen vehicle that Francis will use to enact his final play — the disarmament of the NNP NNPS citizenry . Most NNS will agree that the NNP Nations is already well on the NN to creating the substructure that will be necessary to create the NNP NNP Order – as it was named by George H. W. Bush in his inaugural address . Every NN since Bush has RB blindly supported the agencies and programs of the NNP Nations . As this website has accurately pointed out : Will Juan Carlos ( or Felipe ) be Crowned King of the NNP ? CD of the final steps towards Armageddon will be the NN of Juan Carlos ( or Felipe VI ) as the NN of the NNP Nations which will maintain the international agencies already housed in Geneva , the Swiss Canton that is ruled by Juan Carlos and Felipe through the NNP of Savoy . The original NNP of Nations building will become the JJ home of the NNP Nations General Assembly . As depicted in the Apocalypse of St. John , ten kings will serve the CD king who sits on the ancient throne . This will usher in a JJ NN direction of international cooperation that will hopefully stem the tide of Armageddon . Francis will work through Juan Carlos ( Felipe VI ) as the King of Jerusalem , the NNP of the NNP Nations , and the Jesuit anointed head of the Equestrian Order that has sown allegiance to protect and defend the Pope . It has not been a self - evident conclusion that Juan Carlos ( Felipe VI ) MD be the best person for the job of NN of the NNP Nations . Our intel indicates that Prince Charles ( or the rumored coronation of Prince William that keeps popping up from NN to NN ) have been battling behind the scenes for the job , but have lost the battle , hence no NN to crown the Queen ’s successor . The peculiar behavior of Prince Charles makes more sense when you VBP he was ( is ) trying to appear as a good candidate for the position . Rumors have it that both NNP NNP and Barack Obama covet the position . We imagine that if the Queen were not so advanced in NNS , she , too , MD assume the position should be hers . For if a Windsor MD gain international NN , the wealth of the monarchies and the Knights of Malta might remain secure and hidden . Juan Carlos and Felipe are excellent candidates for the position and with the NN of the Jesuits and the Knights of Malta , they are assured victory especially in light of the dark side of the Windsor family that is coming into JJ light . Hardly anyone believes that the Queen is what she VBZ she is . Elizabeth is more than likely the richest person on NNP if her entire offshore holdings were counted . JJ VBP the Windsors have done little to VB others and the NN theorists rave on about the fraud , corruption , and evil of the English Crown . The death of Princess Diana and Prince Charles ’s affair strikes Charles , and thus his whole family , from the short list of candidates for NNP of the UN . Charles is continuously saying callous things that show he has little compassion or any understanding of the real NN . Here are a few quotes from Prince Charles that will not win him approval from the Pope : “ It [ Christianity ] has no NN to challenge Islam or any other religion . It is merely a Western face of NNP . ” “ Do you seriously expect me to be the JJ Prince of Wales in history not to have a mistress ? “ Islam can teach us today a NN of understanding and living in the NN which Christianity itself is poorer for having lost . ” “ There ’s nothing IN a jolly good disaster to VB NNS to start doing something . ” “ Extremism is no more the monopoly of Islam than it is the monopoly of other religions , including Christianity . ” Thus , it seems evident that either Juan Carlos or Felipe will be the chosen NN to lead the NNP Nations in its battle to bring the Gray Pope ’s Jesuit socialism to the NN . And we are warned by the Jesuits that if we do n’t follow along this path , Armageddon is sure to happen . Gog and Magog gather IN Jerusalem and the stage has been set . The threat of NN annihilation will VB engender support for this Jesuit plan of NN hegemony that plays off of the images of Revelations . These battle plans have been in the works for the past 120 NNS and only a few final steps VBP to be made . : Gray Pope = Pope of the NNP . King of Spain = King of the NNP . Finally , the Anglo - Spanish NNP ( Protestants vs Catholics ) is over . The Jesuits win . The NNP Nations has worked tirelessly since its inception as the NNP of Nations to roll out the carpet for a CD NN NN . It should have been call “ the death of nations ” instead of the NN . Every agency , program or fund works to undermine nations not build them up . Until now , the NNP Nations has been under the NN of the Transnational Warlord Bankers who created it . There is a strong push now for socialism ( leading to theocratic socialism ) and the NNP NNP Order . All of the agencies , programs , funds and aspects of the NNP Nations focuses on the redistribution of wealth . It is essentially a congress of corporations who all are independent , but use the NNP Nations as a banner to fly underneath . There has been little NN vested in the organization which has been demonstrated by the lackluster success of its efforts . But once the NNP Nations has been empowered , there will be no end to the effectiveness of the socialist programs already created and waiting to be empowered . We have examined transnationalist programs in previous articles , but it does n’t hurt to put the UN under a microscope . Scan below to VB some of the organizations , corporations , programs and funds of the NNP Nations that wish to govern and VB the entire globe as CD international union with ten regions . Specialized Agencies are legally independent international organizations with their own rules , membership , organs and financial resources , were brought into relationship with the NNP Nations through negotiated agreements . Given the diversity of their respective fields of NN , history and experience , each agency has its own needs and concerns , not to speak of corporate culture . Office of the NNP Nations High Commissioner for Refugees NNP Nations NNP ’s Fund NNP Nations Conference on Trade and Development International Trade Centre NNP Nations Development Program UNDP Field Offices NNP Nations Capital Development Fund NNP Nations Development Fund for Women NNP Nations Volunteers NNP Nations Environment Program NNP Nations NNP Settlements Program NNP Nations Office on Drugs and Crime NNP Nations Population Fund ) NNP Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East NN Food Program NNP Nations Institute for Disarmament Research NNP Nations Institute for Training and Research NNP Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women NNP Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute NNP Nations Research Institute for NNP Development Counter - Terrorism Committee International Criminal Tribunal for the JJ Yugoslavia International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda NNP Nations Compensation Commission NNP Nations Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission Under the guise of ecology and sustainability , the NNP Nations has developed overall goals for all nations . These goals seems optimistic and positive until you ask how these things MD happen . In order to accomplish any of these goals , the NNP Nations MD RB have to bring all of these aspects “ under NN ” before they MD be assessed and managed . Therefore , it is an assumption that NN NN of all of the most important issues for NN on NN will become the domains of the leaders of the NNP Nations . Essentially , the socialistic goals of the programs of the NNP Nations will be RB turned into a communistic dictatorship to bring all aspects of NN under the NN of the NNP of the NNP Nations and the Gray Pope . RB the NN systems that mete out justice will be UN agencies . The Rothschild Family will continue to be the controlling bankers of the NN through the NNP Nations NNP Bank . The Rothschilds have historically been the Queen ’s bankers , but they are RB aligned with Carlos and the Jesuits . Anybody here VBP to let the Queen VB “ game over ” ? Here are some the programs that the NNP Nations has adopted as goals for the future . If you read closely , the altruism quickly turns to NN domination . • End poverty in all its forms everywhere ( translation : VB all wealth ) • End hunger , achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture ( VB all food sources ) • Ensure healthy lives and promote well - being for all at all ages ( VB all medicine and NN care ) • Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all ( educational brainwashing ) • Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls ( VB all females ) • Ensure availability and sustainable management of NN and sanitation for all ( VB all resources ) • Ensure access to affordable , reliable , sustainable and modern NN for all ( VB all NN ) • Promote sustained , inclusive and sustainable JJ growth , full and productive employment and decent work for all ( contro • l all economies ) Build resilient infrastructure , promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation ( VB all industry ) • Reduce inequality within and among NNS ( VB all nations ) • Make cities and JJ settlements inclusive , safe , resilient and sustainable ( VB all wars ) • Take urgent NN to combat NN NN and its impacts ( VB all development ) • Conserve and sustainably use the oceans , seas and marine resources for sustainable development ( VB all NN ) • Protect , restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems , sustainably manage forests , combat desertification , and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss ( VB all natural resources ) • Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development , provide access to justice for all and build effective , accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels ( VB all courts ) • Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the NNP Partnership for Sustainable Development ( VB all laws ) Transforming our NN : the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development This Agenda is an acclaimed plan of NN for NNS , the NN , and prosperity . It RB claims to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom . The 2030 Agenda asserts that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions , including extreme poverty , is the greatest JJ challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development . All NNS and all stakeholders , acting in collaborative partnership , will implement this plan so they VBP . But keep in NN the very reason the NN has such extreme poverty is that the elite , and mega-rich , monarchs , and Vatican have STOLEN THE NN ’S WEALTH FROM HER NNS . The 1 % ( soon to be the .001 % ) have taken everything that the 99 % have worked , toiled , invested , and saved from the JJ NN that a traveler on the road to the crusades handed his wealth to a Templar or Hospitaller for safe keeping , only to have it confiscated at his death , until today where illicit governments IN the NN continue to rob its citizenry with higher taxes and loss of freedoms . But they do n’t VB we have caught on to this and their Agenda 2030 continues to read : We are resolved to free the JJ race from the tyranny of poverty and VB and to heal and secure our NN . We are determined to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the NN onto a sustainable and resilient path . We must balance the three dimensions of sustainable development : the JJ , JJ and JJ . ( translation : redistribution of wealth , universal Marshall law , NN NN ) NNS – We are determined to end poverty and hunger , in all their forms and dimensions , and to ensure that all JJ beings can fulfil their potential in dignity and equality and in a healthy environment . NNP – We are determined to protect the NN from degradation , including through sustainable consumption and production , sustainably managing its natural resources and taking urgent NN on NN NN , so that it can support the needs of the present and future generations . Prosperity – We are determined to ensure that all JJ beings can enjoy prosperous and fulfilling lives and that JJ , JJ and technological progress occurs in harmony with nature . Peace – We are determined to foster peaceful , just and inclusive societies which are free from fear and violence . There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development . Partnership – We are determined to mobilize the means required to implement this Agenda through a revitalized NNP Partnership for Sustainable Development , VBN on a spirit of strengthened JJ solidarity , focused in particular on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable and with the participation of all NNS , all stakeholders and all NNS . These programs of the NNP Nations are the best tools to institute Socialistic Communism or Theocratic Socialism that any dictator MD VB and they fly under the international banner of charity , love , and the destruction of poverty . Who does n’t VB to support such lofty ideals ? But the devil is in the detail , and the devil does n’t VB us looking at those details . We are awake . And we will banish the NNP Nations from U.S. soil and refuse to fund its evil operations as it is an enemy within our own country . We will indict and prosecute the JJ traitors in our NN and defund and shut down the pseudo - NN agencies who are working to destroy our country . JJ patriots will NEVER give up their Second Amendment Rights to the NNP Nations and we refuse to be a JJ branch of the UN . We will reinstate the U.S. Constitution , including the very important 13th Amendment , and fill FEMA internment camps with traitors of our country , no matter how esteemed they make us VB they are . The good NN is that the NN for Armageddon is not now . The Jesuits use fear driven apocalyptic narratives to press the issue of the second coming of Christ as a NN leader who victoriously rides a white horse into Jerusalem to expel the Jews and Muslims from the Holy Land . Jesuits are warriors and soldiers who do n’t hesitate to do whatever it takes to forward the aims of the Society of Jesus and the Black Pope . But when the White Pope RB becomes the Black Pope – total Jesuit dominion of the Catholic Church is complete and the stage is set for the Jesuit bid for NN domination through the King of Jerusalem , the Pope of Jerusalem and their governing body of the NNP Nations . The battle is now and the NN is at hand to recognize the signs of the NN and not be duped into believing another globalist narrative that peace will come when all wealth is gathered and redistributed and all religions are melted down into the least common denominator . The Catholic Church has always chosen the side of the strong , whether fascist , Jesuit , warlord banker , or Knight of any CD of dozens of orders . Perhaps it is NN that the Vatican be challenged on its infallibility and moral foundation that puts its own interests above those of others . In our next article , we will give our readers a detailed plan on the NN out . But in the meantime , each CD of us can do something …. NOW . As we are fond of saying in flight jargon , “ Put your mask on RB . Then VB someone else . ” Whatever YOU are passionate about , VB MORE PASSIONATE about . We are passionate about research and writing , so we write these articles . If you object to forced vaccinations , then host the VAXXED movie in your community . Or send this link of Robert De Niro to your friends and family . If you are aware of the relationship of the Second Amendment and our freedom , then teach others — but on a bigger scale than you are now . If you are concerned about bank bail - ins , then move your NN to a community bank or credit union . If you do n’t VB your family poisoned by GMOs and pharmaceuticals , then grow your own food or join a CSA and be mindful about the drugs you are taking . If you read our article on legal propaganda and do n’t VB to be brainwashed by the NN , then turn it off . If you are in a position to VB drive legislation to audit the Federal Reserve NNP , then keep doing it until Congress does its job . If you VBP that 9 - 11 is more nefarious than the Sixty Minutes interview , then write CBS and let them VB that they will continue to VB your viewership ( which they VBP ! ) if they continue to reveal the truth . Be a regular visitor to this site to stay informed about the real NN of the day . When you can , support independent NN sites through your donations . Congratulations to all the patriots out there ! The reason things are being revealed at an explosive rate these days is because we are ALL doing something , a few things , or as much as we can , to create the very havoc and confusion that they have been hoisting on us . We are just VBG the Cloward - Piven strategy IN the traitors have been VBG against us – overload the NN until it collapses . But it is their NN we are VBG to collapse . : Collectively , by doing what we can as individual and community FREEDOM SLEEPER CELLS , we are creating a storm that will drive the elite cabal into the very mountain bunkers they have built or themselves for the end - times ."

By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Russian Subscribers In my report I had detailed how an ever increasing number of continuing NN surges have begun hitting our NN , and to the disruption of our NN ’s NN cycles . Conjointly with the disruptions of the NN ’s NN systems has been the unexplained lighting up of the winter night skies in the far Northern Arctic regions , and as summarized in an article that VBD in part , "" The entire horizon is raised IN magic , IN the hand of NNP is bringing it up . ” More ominous for the NN ’s JJ beings perhaps , is that what has been generally relegated to the NN ’s Southern Hemispheric regions is now occurring in the Northern ones too . The NN for these increasing NN ‘ blasts ’ are increasingly being pointed towards a number of events that have occurred in the universe in NNS past , and to which we are now feeling their effects . CD of these events was the Supernova Blast ( SN1987a ) that occurred on , and as explained by Peter Garnavich of the NNP of Notre Dame , "" The real fireworks show is finally starting , and over the next CD NNS things will VB spectacular . ” But , and as RB contained in this NN , the NN line for the NN ’s visibility of this event lies between the NNS of 1995 - 2015 . Current events are suggesting however that these events are VBG to be occurring much sooner than 2010 . The fear evident in Western NNS regarding this event belongs to their NNS about Supernovas , and that NN that they are CD of the most energetic explosive events VBN . “ They occur at the end of a star 's lifetime , when its nuclear fuel is exhausted and it is no longer supported by the release of nuclear NN . If the star is particularly massive , then its core will collapse and in so doing will release a huge amount of NN . ” In a particularly strange event surrounding SN1987a , JJ NNS ‘ reworked ’ existing NNS about supernovas to show not what is necessarily JJ , but rather what they seemingly wanted to VB . ( Or more ominously to keep this NN hidden from others . ) This ‘ reworking ’ though , still revealed the nervousness about this event by the JJ NNS , and as evidenced in the comment by Dr. Neil Gehrels of NNP 's Goddard NNP Flight Center when he stated , "" The possibility for mass extinction is indeed real , yet the NN seems much lower than we have thought . "" This JJ reworking of these formulas to obtain the results they desired left out the continued ozone layer depletion over the Southern Hemispheric Pole , and which according to the currently ongoing 2004 British survey NNS , “ The ozone layer over much of the Southern Hemisphere south of 50° remains IN CD % below the JJ term normal . ” Where in past times ozone layer depletion was rightly ascribed to cosmic rays ( gamma rays ) , Western NNS have with their reworked mathematics created a whole JJ methodology that blames these depletions on CFC’s ( chlorofluorocarbons ) , and which RB JJ term Russian school NN MD laugh about if this were not so serious an event . Best stated about these events from a Western perspective though are these words from an unknown person , “ Now , do n't VB me wrong ; I 'm not in favor of ANY strange laboratory - created substances polluting the air I have to breathe , and I wholeheartedly endorse the current campaign to rid the atmosphere of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) , the atoms being blamed for the so - called "" holes "" in the ozone layer . But just stop for a minute and VB : If CFCs caused the so - called "" holes , "" why are they ONLY over the ? Are the polar explorers and NNS VBG too much spray - on deodorant and fly - killer ? Of course not . If CFCs had much to do at all with the so - called "" holes , "" then the "" holes "" MD be over , or , or , or at least somewhere relative to these places where it MD be shown that the air currents were causing the CFCs to accumulate . But they are not . The "" holes "" only occur in CD places , over the North and , exactly in accordance with natural forces which create the bulk of ozone , and exactly in accordance with the NNS and predictions of the NNS who discovered them in the JJ place . Western NN has a JJ history of contradicting itself , and this NN is no exception , and as stated in this research paper contributed to by a number of JJ educational institutions shows , "" JJ - term effects of gamma ray bursts MD spread IN the NNP and include ozone layer depletion , JJ cooling , acid rain and radionuclide production . "" So today as the NN is awash in acid rain , the ozone layers at the Northern and Southern Hemispheric Poles are expanding , the Western NNS put before their ever growing uneducated citizens a scientific explanation that blames these events on CFCs and fossil fuels , when they VBP the NN behind these assertions is totally JJ . An independent JJ researcher , Ricardo L. Carezani , in his article titled , “ SN 1987 A and the Neutrino ” VBZ it best in describing Western NNS ’ penchant for making facts fit their absurd assertions ; “ Putting together all 7 facts , the * overwhelming * neutrino NN is replaced by an overwhelming NN of "" the pharaoh 's NN "" ( i.e. nothing ) . For those of you not familiar with the pharaoh 's NN , you can perform it yourself with a table and ruler : measure an arbitrary number of table parts , use an arbitrary equation , and come up with PI . Anyone can do it ! RB !! ” Coming literally on the heels of this Supernova event was the most astronomically significant event of JJ history with the most powerful explosion in the universe since the NNP Bang that occurred in December , 1997 . “ Astronomers are mystified by the most powerful explosion ever witnessed , an enormous burst of gamma ray NN 12 CD light NNS from NNP that in CD second released almost as much NN as all the stars of the universe . ” ; and as stated in this article by the JJ NN source CNN . NNP Headquarters at the Goddard NNP Flight Center further added about this event : “ A recently detected cosmic gamma ray burst released a hundred times more NN than previously theorized , making it the most powerful explosion since the creation of the universe in the NNP Bang . ” For about CD or CD seconds , this burst was as luminous as all the rest of the entire universe , "" VBD Caltech professor George Djorgovski , CD of the CD principal investigators on the team from the California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , CA . Aside from the majority of Western peoples being ignorant of these events , Western NNS , at least publicly , are still not acknowledging the significance of them for all of the NN ’s peoples . RB with hundreds of thousands lying dead in there can be no expectation that Western peoples will either become knowledgeable about or heed these JJ universal warnings . As incredible as it MD seem to us Russians , Western NNS , ( and especially the Americans ) these JJ Darwinist thinking JJ beings , fail to RB VB the connection between the last JJ NN shuttle disaster , the present lighting of the Arctic Regions of the Northern Hemisphere and continuing JJ NN chaos ! They RB have NN ordered training of their NNS through their educational systems that indoctrinate them into this NN of being ! The NNS and grandparents of these NNS RB willingly hand over their NNS to these mass indoctrination centers , and with their knowing the destructiveness of these institutions from the very examples our own Russian history has shown them . The Western NN did report that , “ Upper atmosphere MD hold clues in mystery ” in an article that appeared in an JJ national publication , USA Today . This article VBZ in part , “ The NN shuttle Columbia 's troubles began as it dropped IN a meteor from orbit into a mysterious and poorly understood atmospheric region that NNS have dubbed the "" ignorosphere ” . The Concorde , the supersonic jet , flies in the bottom of this region at more than 11 NNS above the NNP 's NN . Nothing but a rocket can fly at its upper limit of 53 NNS . The "" ignorosphere "" encompasses the mesosphere and upper stratosphere . Invisible clouds , strange electrical flashes called red sprites and blue lightning bolts that strike upward from the tops of clouds inhabit the thin air . This is the place where falling stars are made . The "" ignorosphere "" earns its nickname from the fact that you can't VB there from here without a rocket . It is too high for NN balloons and too low for satellites to dip down to gather NN . The connection to these seemingly disconnected events is the rare NN phenomena called Noctilucent Clouds . What are Noctilucent Clouds ? “ NLC were RB discovered in the summer of 1884 after the eruption of Krakatoa which occurred in 1883 . The volcanic eruption was at RB thought to have contributed to the formation of NLC due to the ejection of huge quantities of dust into the upper atmosphere ; however it has been proven that the eruption was not responsible for their formation . ” The actual "" discoverer "" is debated , however recent work has shown that the JJ conclusive observations were performed by T.W. Backhouse from Sunderland , U.K. Gadsden and Schroder ( 1989 ) question why Noctilucent Clouds were not discovered prior to 1885 and suggest that the eruption of Krakatoa was significant in that it caused observers to take more of a careful note of the twilight skies . This is a very difficult hypothesis to comprehend as it suggests that no observers ever bothered to take note of the twilight sky . This is a highly unlikely scenario as it is MD seem very improbable that astronomers and meteorologists who frequently observed MD miss such a highly conspicuous phenomena . Of such concern are these phenomenal Noctilucent Clouds that a number of Western scientific studies are underway in the search for the answers as to why they are increasing , and to the extent that light from them is being reflected back into the normally darkened winter skies . “ Increased sightings of noctilucent clouds MD be related to NN NN . ” VBZ CD of these research studies underway by an organization named CAWSES ( NNP and NNP of the Sun- NNP NNP ) , and as stated in their report titled : A proposed JJ SCOSTEP Program for 2004 - 2008 . Another NN being conducted is by the HAIL Project ( Holographic Array for Ionospheric Lightning ) , associated with the NNP Stanford NNP , where their approach is being directed towards , “ Direct electrodynamic coupling between lightning discharges and the mesosphere / lower ionosphere evidenced by spectacular luminous optical NNS VBN as red sprites and elves , VLF signatures of rapid conductivity NNS and radar detection of transient ionization patches above a thunderstorms . ” Specifically , these increasing cosmic ray bursts hitting our NN are causing , among other things , an ever increasing amount of upper atmosphere lighting occurrences that are RB disturbing our NN ’s magnetic field and causing such bad things to happen as JJ planes falling out of the sky due to disruptions in our magnetic field . These are best VBN to aircraft pilots as gravity , or buoyancy waves . “ Gravity , or buoyancy waves , are pressure waves generated by disturbances within the atmosphere , where the restoring forces ( potential NN ) for the wave motion is provided by buoyancy and gravity , rather than compression / expansion as in higher frequency acoustic waves . ” Coinciding with all of these events have been the Americans associating them with their older NNS ’s NN ( to them myths and legends ) and warnings of not only these events , but the future events to come . Such an example is the association of the 1987 Supernova ( SN1987a ) with a deliberately planted falsehood of it being the ‘ Blue Star ’ much talked about in the Hopi JJ Indian legend . The problem is that the much reported on Hopi ‘ Blue Star ’ , and its significance , is a lie . This is able to be so because the ‘ NN ’ involved with JJ Darwinism is that it subverts in the JJ being their ability to find truths within themselves and surrenders it to the mass propaganda of the NNP . IN the National Socialistic NNP ( Nazi ) of during the Great Patriotic NNP ( NNP NNP II ) the individuals not in step with the masses are cast outside their JJ folds . For this particular example we can VB that the beginnings of these rumors that the Hopi peoples had in their older NNS ’s stories a Blue Star began not with the Hopi peoples but with CD Western NNS , Thomas E. Mails , in his book titled “ The Hopi Survival Kit ” and Moira Timms with her book titled “ Beyond Prophecies and Predictions ” . "" I am nobody . I am not a shaman , a medicine NN , a guru , a channeler , or a psychic . I am not an ex-intelligence officer from the NNP , the NSA , the secret services or any other branch of any service . I am not the reincarnation of an ancient being , an ancient deity or a heavenly visitor . I have nothing to offer you in the NN of credibility . I am a nobody ... and I VBP it that NN . "" ---Robert Morning Sky , introducing himself in an article called , "" The Blue Star Hoax "" that appeared in LEADING EDGE # 95 . Among other things , Morning Sky , a Hopi , claimed that the fabled "" Blue Star "" does not exist in Hopi legends , teachings or mythology . It was a term that he invented in the early 1970's that has since been pirated by researchers who falsely claimed to have spent NN with Hopi Elders learning the secrets of the Blue Star Kachina ( a kachina that Morning Sky VBZ does n't exist ) , and channelers , psychics and clairvoyants who claim to have received Blue Star revelations from their spiritual sources . As we VBP in about the older NNS of the NN , it is RB possible that their trickster nature has been at play here when it comes to their interactions with the Western peoples of the NN . Such exactly are the NNS of the Kachina Cult , and who the Western NNS call the Hopi . The Western NNS ’s ‘ everything ’ is separate , nothing is ‘ connected ’ NN view contributes to their beliefs that ‘ their ’ older peoples are disassociated with the other older peoples of the NN , and therefore gives them no understanding that all of the earths older peoples are the same in thought and spirit about all things . The mythical lies and NN organized propaganda facing the Western NNS ’s however keep them locked away from the incredible mysteries surround these events I ’ve presented here before you today . In my last letter to my JJ subscribers , and to which I ’ve RB shared with all of you , titled “ Now Visible NNP Heralds Warning of Doom to NNP ” I wrote about the significance of this JJ ‘ Green NNP ’ and it ’s historical meaning to us living in these NNS of great tribulation and coming cataclysms , if only we listen to the earths older peoples and the universe itself and learn their songs . In the ‘ choices of the threes ’ that JJ beings are always presented with , we have been shown from these past weeks events that the earths older peoples still VBP the songs and did not perish in this latest cataclysm : “ Elders ' NNP NNP Spares Some Thais ” . We RB have the examples of the NN ’s animals knowing these songs too : ‘ Tsunami Adds to Belief in Animals ' ' Sixth Sense ' And we RB have from another of the NN ’s older peoples , that our dreams hold these songs too , if we but listen to them : “ His wife dreamed of floods , he built on stilts , and they survived Tsunami ” . The ancient examples of the warnings of ‘ oneness ’ show to us all RB that there is no insignificant event that for the greater warning of all JJ beings will be made VBN to all , and these are three . For JJ NNS now the Universe has been singing its song of warning to all JJ beings . From the Southern Hemispheric Regions , and where PRP looks into the great Magellanic Cloud , the older peoples of they call the Aborigines “ Slept and dreamt under the stars . They took the night stars for granted . They embraced the darkness . It is woven into their culture through song , dance , ritual , art and myth . ” The Greater Clouds of Magellan is a nebula located about 200,000 light NNS away and can be viewed with the naked eye . It appears to be IN a slightly blurred cloud . In addition , the Tarantula Nebula , VBN to be the most beautiful sight in the skies ( it resembles a spider ) , runs over the Greater Clouds of Magellan , so it is a constellation with plenty of sights . ” It is written here . It RB carries the name of The Swordfish , and which I had previously written to you about . In a book titled “ Our Rock Who Art In Heaven , Hallowed Be Thy Name ” , written by Jacqueline Brook , it is written : “ The NN [ or literally , "" swordfish "" ] associated with Hermes shines bright green with an oval shape ... ” On “ … the brightest supernova in four centuries lit up the southern sky … ” and began singing a song to the NN ’s JJ beings . If you are you ’ll VB that the lies being VBN by the NNS from the nations of the West are those born out of fear . Their fear comes from a knowing that the materialistic NN that they have spent thousands of NNS building , and in defiance of the stewardship of this NN and its NNS ’s safekeeping they were entrusted with , is soon to be no more . While the great and terrible armies of the NN and the vast and mysterious powers of the universe gather for battle , the peoples of the Western Nations remain asleep and in ignorance of their soon to come deaths . In this NN today the Western peoples are truly lost , soulless and faceless , not knowing any of the events about to befall them . From this slumber of theirs , we , and JJ others of our kind , have pledged ourselves to save as JJ as can be saved , not from the death of their JJ lives , but the death of their very souls . © January 4 , 2005 , EU and US all rights reserved ."

Though Western NNS have relegated these rare Major Lunar Standstill events to their esoteric NN of Astrology , Russian Astro-Geologists are likewise firm in their belief that these types of Solar NN events do indeed have effects upon our NNP , and to almost all extents are catastrophic in nature . An ‘ informal ’ explanation of a Lunar Standstill event we can read from the Wikipedia archives , and which VBZ : "" At the major lunar standstill , which takes place every 18.6 NNS , the range of the declination of the NNP reaches a maximum . As a result , at high latitudes , the NNP appears to move in just CD weeks from high in the sky to low on the horizon . This NN appears to have had special significance for the Bronze Age societies who built the megalithic monuments in Britain , and it RB has significance for some neo -pagan religions . The next major lunar standstill occurs in 2006 . As the NNP spins on its axis , the stars above us appear to move in circles . It appears to us as if all the stars are fixed in a great sphere surrounding us . In the same NN that we measure positions on the NN VBG latitude and longitude , we measure positions of stars on this sphere in JJ Ascension ( equivalent to longitude ) and Declination ( equivalent to latitude ) . If you stand at a place on the NN which has latitude 50° , then the stars directly above you have a declination of 50° . Unlike the stars , the NNP and NNP do not have a fixed declination . As the NNP travels its annual orbit IN the NNP , with its rotational axis tilted at about 23.5° from the axis of orbital motion ( a straight line joining a point on the tropic of cancer the ' opposite ' point on the tropic of capricorn ) , the NNP 's declination NNS from +23.5° in June to - 23.5° in December . Thus , in the Northern hemisphere , the NNP is higher in the sky in June , causing summer , than it is in December , when the NNP is low in the sky and is only above the horizon for a short NN , causing winter . The NNP RB VBZ in declination , but it does so in only a month , instead of a NN for the NNP . So it might VB from a declination of +25° to - 25° in just CD weeks , returning to + 25 ° CD weeks later . Thus , in just CD month the NN can move from being high in the sky , to low on the horizon , and back again . But , unlike the NNP , the maximum and minimum declination reached by the NNP RB varies . This is because the orbit of the NNP 's revolution about the NNP is inclined by about 5° to the orbit of the NNP 's revolution IN the NNP , and so the maximum declination of the NN varies from ( 23.5° - 5° ) =18.5° to ( 23.5°+5° ) =28.5° . The effect of this is that at CD particular NN ( the minor lunar standstill ) , the NNP will VB its declination during the month from +18.5° to - 18.5° , which is a total movement of 37° . This is not a particularly JJ NN , and MD not be very noticeable in the sky . However , 9.3 NNS later , during the major lunar standstill , the NNP will VB its declination during the month from +28.5° to - 28.5° , which is a total movement of 57° , and which is enough to take it from high in the sky to low on the horizon in just CD weeks . "" Though the major concerns of these NNS remain centered on the Canadian - NNP NNPS Pacific Northwest and the NNP NNPS NNP Madrid Fault Zone Regions an equal concern of imminent catastrophic earthquakes remains for NNP ’s California Region , and which a major precursor to earthquake activity is now being reported , and as we can read as reported by the NBC 11 NNP Service in their article titled "" Dead Fish Mystery Perplexes Bay Area Biologists "" , and which VBZ : "" Thousands of fish in the Bay Area are turning up dead , and biologists still have no answers to this aquatic mystery . Over the last couple of months , an alarming number of dead fish and sharks have been washing up on Bay Area shores . In NNP , 40 sharks were VBN dead . Then , just a couple of weeks ago , 1,000 sturgeon and striped bass were VBN floating in the Bay and lying on shore , NBC11's Diane Dwyer reported . Biologists VBD the phenomenon occurred between the San Mateo Bridge and the Dumbarton Bridge and between San Leandro and the Hayward shore on the East Bay . For fish and game biologist Becky Ota , the death of so JJ fish at CD NN is perplexing . "" Well , we are concerned about it , "" Ota VBD . "" The department 's aware of it . We 're trying to find out what the NN is , but it 's been elusive . It 's been a mystery so far . We have n't been able to pinpoint it yet . "" These reports further VBP that the July 6th mass solar ejection from NNP Spot 898 was another likely indicator of an impending catastrophic event due to the electromagnetic instability currently existing between these Regions , our NNP and the NNP . More ominously , however , from these reports was the July 4th ‘ Banging Earthquake ’ reported in the NNP NNPS Pacific Northwest Region , and as we can read as reported by the Peninsula Daily NNP Service in their article titled "" Fourth of July earthquake rattles region "" , and which VBZ : "" Residents from Port Townsend to Port Angeles felt a JJ earthquake measuring 3.6 on the Richter scale Tuesday afternoon , They reported dishes rattling , furniture moving and lamps swinging . The quake was centered under the Strait of Juan de Fuca almost halfway between Sequim and Victoria . The quake , centered 27 NNS below the Strait 's seabed , occurred at 1:37 p.m. , the NNP of NNP 's Department of NNP and NNP Sciences reported . There were no reports of damage or injury , but authorities VBD CD persons in Port Townsend , 22 in Sequim and CD in Port Angeles reported feeling the shaker . ``My windows rattled , and my roof started creaking , '' VBD Gus McDonald of Port Townsend in a telephone call to the Peninsula Daily NNP . VBD Lois Cahill of Sequim : ``No PRP RB knew what was happening , it just shook the dishes in kitchen . '' Peninsula Daily NNP photographer Keith Thorpe VBD the quake jiggled his computer monitor at his Port Angeles home . Some NNS in the greater Victoria area VBD CBC Radio they felt CD tremors that happened about five seconds apart , accompanied by a loud bang . "" This ‘ Banging Earthquake ’ was RB felt in Canada ’s Pacific Northwest Region , and as we can read as reported by the Vancouver NNP NNP Service in their article titled "" Minor earthquake rattles southern Vancouver Island "" , and which VBZ , "" A minor earthquake measuring 3.7 on the Richter scale rumbled through southern Vancouver Island Tuesday afternoon , bringing the usual flurry of calls to the Pacific Geoscience Centre and a glut of hits to its website . "" These reports further VBP that Western NNS are now acknowledging their Russian Scientific counterparts in warning of the likely increase of catastrophic earthquake and volcanic events due to JJ NN , and as we can VB evidenced by the Canadian Press NNP Service in their article titled "" NN NN MD VB earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , NNS VBP "" , and which VBZ : "" So the warnings of harsher heat waves , stronger hurricanes and rising seas fail to impress . How about volcanic eruptions in the Arctic , or a tsunami off the coast of Newfoundland ? The latest scientific discipline to enter the fray over JJ NN is geology . And the forecasts from some quarters are dramatic - not only will the NN shake , it will spit fire . A number of geologists VBP glacial melting due to NN NN will unleash pent - up pressures in the NNP 's crust , causing extreme geological events such as earthquakes , tsunamis and volcanic eruptions . A cubic metre of NN weighs nearly a tonne and some glaciers are more than a kilometre thick . When the weight is removed through melting , the suppressed strains and stresses of the underlying rock come to NN . "" Pressures upon the North NNP have likewise been increased due to the rapid melting of the massive Greenland NN Sheet , and as we can read as reported by the Los Angeles Times NNP Service in their article titled "" Glaciers ' melt rate surprises NNS "" , and which VBZ : "" The Greenland NN sheet -- CD NNS thick and broad enough to blanket an area the size of Mexico -- shapes the NN 's NN , matched in influence only by Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere . In its heart , snow that fell a quarter of a CD NNS ago is preserved . Should all of the NN sheet ever thaw , the meltwater MD raise NN level 21 NNS and swamp the NN 's coastal cities , home to a CD NNS . It MD VB higher tides , generate more powerful storm surges and , by altering ocean currents , drastically disrupt the JJ NN . NN experts have started to worry that the icecap is disappearing in ways that computer models had not predicted . By all accounts , the glaciers of Greenland are melting twice as fast as they were five NNS ago , RB as the NN sheets of Antarctica RB are shrinking , researchers at NNP 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the NNP of Kansas reported in February . Researchers have focused on a delicate ribbon -- the equilibrium line , which marks the fulcrum of frost and thaw in Greenland 's seasonal balance . The zone rims the icecap IN a drawstring . Summer melting , on average , offsets the annual accumulation of snow . But across the icecap , the area of seasonal melting was broader last NN than in 27 NNS of record - keeping , NNP of Colorado NN NNS reported . In early NNP , NNS on the icecap some days were almost 20 degrees above normal , hovering just below freezing . By 2005 , Greenland was beginning to lose more NN volume than anyone had anticipated -- an annual loss of up to 52 cubic NNS a NN -- according to more recent satellite gravity measurements released by JPL . The volume of freshwater NN dumped into the Atlantic Ocean has almost tripled in a decade . There was RB a period of melting in December . "" We have never seen that , "" Steffen VBD . In an influential paper published in the journal NNP , Zwally surmised that the NN sheets had accelerated in response to warmer NNS , as summer meltwater lubricated the base of the NN sheet and allowed it to slide faster toward the NN . In a NN no NN had detected , the warm NN made its NN through thousands of NNS of NN to the bedrock -- in weeks , not decades or centuries . NNP of Texas physicist Ginny Catania pulled an NN - penetrating radar in a search pattern IN the camp , seeking NN of any melt holes or drainage crevices that MD so quickly channel the hot NN of JJ NN deep into the NN . To her surprise , she detected a maze of tunnels , natural pipes and cracks beneath the unblemished NN . "" I have never seen anything IN it , except in an area where NNS have been drilling bore holes , "" Catania VBD . "" These reports rate the likelihood of a catastrophic 6.5 or higher magnitude earthquake event during this Major Lunar Standstill at : US Pacific / Canada Northwest Region 52 % ; NNP Madrid Fault Zone Region 51 % ; Caribbean NNP Region 43 % ; Mid Atlantic Ridge 41 % ; US / Canada Great Lakes Region 40 % ; California Region 38 % ; Mexico City 37 % ; and Panama Canal Region 36 % between the dates of July 10th and July 13th . © July CD , 2006 EU and US all rights reserved .

Hydrocarbons are naturally - occurring compounds and form the basis of crude oil , natural gas , coal , and other important NN sources . Hydrocarbons are highly combustible and produce NN dioxide , NN , and heat when they are burned . Therefore , hydrocarbons are highly effective as a source of fuel . Hydrocarbons occur naturally throughout the NN , originating from plant and animal fossils that have been formed by the forces of NN and weight over millennia . They are mostly VBN deep underground , in porous rock formations ( such as sandstone , limestone , and shale ) . Porous rock formations are often VBN in JJ bodies of NN , so there is an immense quantity of hydrocarbons trapped deep beneath the oceans . Oil and natural gas exploration NNS use advanced engineering techniques to identify these potential reservoirs and pull their resources to the NN for JJ use . Examples of such technologies include offshore oil platforms , directional drilling , and enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) techniques . Hydrocarbons are very important for the modern economy . Globally , hydrocarbons are responsible for roughly 85 % of NN consumption . This figure MD actually understate the role of hydrocarbons in the economy by a significant margin because they are VBN in a wide range of applications aside from their use as a source of NN . For example , refined petroleum has been VBN to produce myriad derivative materials that play critical roles in the JJ economy , such as plastics , solvents , and lubricants . JJ techniques are VBN to extract hydrocarbons , depending on the type and location of the reserve . For example , hydraulic fracturing — better VBN as “ fracking ” — is VBN to extract natural gas from shale rock by VBG pressurized fracking fluid to create fissures through which the gas can escape to the NN . Mining is VBN to access oil sands , which are unconventional deposits of crude oil that are heavily intermixed with sand and sandstone . Unfortunately , it is now understood that there is a serious JJ cost to VBG hydrocarbons as a primary source of NN . NN gasses released during the combustion of hydrocarbons are contributing to NN NN . The process of oil and gas extraction can damage the NN environment and surrounding groundwater of the extraction site . JJ economists argue that hydrocarbon NN production involves substantial negative externalities that are not sufficiently represented in the NN NN of oil and gas . In fact , considering the mounting cost of NN - NN - related phenomena , JJ argue that these externalities significantly outweigh any cost savings associated with hydrocarbons . To address these concerns , there is a growing movement toward the use of renewable NN sources , such as solar , nuclear , wind , and geothermal NN . Alongside innovations in battery technology and “ smart grid ” infrastructure , these JJ NN alternatives MD play a significantly larger role in JJ NN production in the NNS and decades ahead ."

This article reviews the observed impacts of NN NN on biodiversity and considers some perspectives for the future at the national level . The following impacts are already evident for all considered taxonomic groups : elevation shifts of distribution towards mountain summits , spread of thermophilous NNS , colonisation by JJ NNS from warmer areas and phenological shifts . Additionally , in the driest areas , increasing droughts are affecting tree survival and fish NNS are suffering from warm NNS in lowland regions . These observations are coherent with model projections , and future NNS will probably follow the current trends . These NNS will likely VB extinctions for alpine NNS ( competition , loss of habitat ) and lowland NNS ( NN or drought stress ) . In the very urbanised Swiss landscape , the high fragmentation of the natural ecosystems will hinder the dispersal of JJ NNS towards mountains . Moreover , disruptions in NN interactions caused by individual migration rates or phenological shifts are likely to have consequences for biodiversity . Conversely , the inertia of the ecosystems ( NN longevity , restricted dispersal ) and the local persistence of populations will probably result in lower extinction rates than expected with some models , at least in 21st century . It is thus very difficult to estimate the impact of NN NN in terms of NN extinctions . A greater recognition by society of the intrinsic value of biodiversity and of its importance for our existence will be essential to put in place effective mitigation measures and to safeguard a maximum number of native NNS ."

Chirping from the talus slopes of the Teton Range in the Rocky Mountains , the JJ pika ( ) sends a warning call to intruders — in this NN NNS climbing up the switchbacks in Grand Teton National Park ’s Cascade Canyon . Sounding its alarm from a rocky perch , then darting into crevices and shadow on the steep slope , the rodent - sized , round - eared , brownish gray pika goes largely unnoticed . But as the second NNS petitioned for protection under the U.S. Endangered NNP Act ( ESA ) because of NN NN - associated threats ( the polar bear was the JJ ) , the pika cannot afford to be overlooked for much longer . The JJ pika lives primarily at elevations between 8,000 and 13,000 NNS , though it MD be VBN at significantly lower elevations , including a little above NN level . Low - elevation pika populations , however , are at high NN of NN NN , particularly local NN and decreased precipitation . Populations of pika in Yosemite National Park , for example , have migrated more than 500 NNS upslope over the course of the last century , a shift coincident with a NN increase of 5.4 °F in Yosemite during that same period of NN . More significantly , over the course of only a decade — between 1999 and 2008 — pikas in the Great Basin on the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada experienced a nearly five - fold increase in extinction rate and an 11 - fold increase in the rate of upslope retreat . Pikas there are now moving upslope at a rate of 475 NNS per decade . In 2010 , despite the documented loss of pikas and NN linking pika declines and range shifts with NN NN , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) decided not to protect the JJ pika under the ESA . The decision was denounced by the nonprofit Centers for Biological Diversity , which had petitioned for the NN ’ protection , and was supported by some biologists , who claimed that most populations of the JJ pika are stable . Pikas , however , are highly susceptible to warm NNS and will die within several hours of constant exposure to NNS of 75 to 78 °F . Their survival RB appears to depend heavily on contiguous habitat . For instance , a NN of historical pika population sites in the southern Rockies , where pika habitat extends over a JJ area , revealed that just four out of 69 populations had been extirpated since the 1980s . The extirpations occurred at sites that were once wet but that had dried out over the course of the last 100 NNS . Contiguous habitat and upslope migration are the pika ’s only hope for escape from local NN NN and drying . But at higher elevations , food MD be scarce and the NN too cold , and given the isolation of pika populations , it remains to be seen whether migration and dispersal to JJ areas can actually rescue the NN . Furthermore , several decades into the future , the high , mountainous elevations where pikas can now find refuge MD no longer be cool and wet enough to support their survival . Indeed , NN prediction models have suggested that summertime NNS in pika habitat will increase by 5.4 °F by 2050 . While the FWS cited this figure in its report explaining why pika do not warrant protection under the ESA , such an increase will render the lower elevations of JJ mountain ranges , including the Teton Range , uninhabitable for pika . And while it is difficult to predict precise NN increases beyond 2050 , NNS likely will continue to rise , forcing the JJ pika higher and higher , further restricting its range and its chances of survival in the process ."

Oakes is a Conservation Scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society , an Adjunct Professor at Stanford NNP in the Department of NNP NNP NNP , and the author of "" In Search of the Canary Tree . "" Sarah H. Olson is the Associate Director of epidemiology for the Wildlife Conservation Society NNP Program . James Watson is the Director of the NNP and Research Initiative at the Wildlife Conservation Society and a professor of conservation NN at the NNP of Queensland . The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own . View more opinion at CNN . ( CNN ) The NNP and its inhabitants face three JJ crises : the NN NN , the NN NN and biodiversity NN . Unto themselves , each already feels overwhelming -- in terms of JJ - NN consequences , the speed and scale of impacts , and the transformative actions needed to keep the NN habitable . CD commonality lies at the core of these massive JJ challenges : the destructive relationship between humanity and the natural NN . JJ activities drive these invisible enemies , and our hope for the future will derive from solutions VBN on caring for nature . With NNP - CD - related mortality expected to be high in vulnerable populations , at least CD expert , NYU NN economist Gernot Wagner , has likened the NN to "" NN NN at warp speed . "" The exponential growth rate of NNP - CD makes the NN far more apparent to most NNS , on a daily basis , than a NN NN . Yet the devastating recent fires in Australia and the loss of Pacific islands to NN - level rise remove any doubt that NN NN is a fast - moving NN . We already VBP the links between NN NN and the third NN , biodiversity loss . A 2019 report from the Intergovernmental NNP - Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services outlined the consequences for humanity of the rampant erosion of ecosystems across NNP . The report highlighted clear NN of reductions in pollination , NN regulation , soil NN and pollution regulation among a myriad of lost "" natural capital . "" It RB provided NN that intact ecosystems -- especially our vast tropical and boreal forests -- play a critical role in abating runaway NN NN . These areas soak up RB 30 % of mankind 's NN NNS each NN and will continue to provide this huge service if effectively conserved . Such natural systems RB offer humanity its best defense against NN NN by regulating local NN , for example , and reducing risks of NN - related hazards such as NN - level rise and floods . Areas of high biological diversity often RB hold a high level of viral diversity . As such , increased degradation of our NN 's intact ecosystems can pose JJ NN risks . NNS use the term "" zoonosis "" to refer to infectious diseases IN NNP - CD ( caused by the NN NN - NN - 2 ) that spread from animals to NNS . The current NN has been associated with a NN in Wuhan , NNP , where the flow of wild animals from forest frontiers to urban communities likely provided the source of infection . Yet wild animals themselves do not VB the problem . Rather , NNS continue to place increased pressures on the NNP 's remaining biodiverse ecosystems . Activities such as the commercial wildlife trade , logging and deforestation , and the expansion of agriculture into previously undisturbed areas alter the "" normal "" circulation of viruses . These NNS can increase contact and exchange - rates of pathogens between wildlife and NNS . In other words , as humanity encroaches further into nature , NNS have a greater chance of coming into contact with JJ pathogens carried by animals , and humanity finds itself at greater NN of pandemics IN the NN unfolding now . The problems of pandemics , NN and biodiversity loss are linked -- but so are the solutions . Ending the commercial trade of wildlife for JJ consumption MD drastically mitigate that exposure , limiting the NN of pathogens spilling over from animals to NNS and causing NN outbreaks . At the same NN , protecting ecosystems from JJ encroachment helps maintain biodiversity and mitigate NN NN , by maintaining plant NN that absorbs NN from the atmosphere . Only a few months ago , we looked to 2020 as the "" super NN "" for biodiversity and NN NN . Nations that signed onto international conventions on NN ( CoP 26 ) and biodiversity ( CoP 15 ) hoped to finalize JJ strategic plans looking to 2030 . With the key NN and biodiversity meetings delayed due to the NN , coordinated NN remains pressing . Perhaps the NNP - CD NN itself MD still bring negotiators together ( in spirit if not in person ) for unified NN , if the JJ NN manages to rouse a sense of solidarity among NN governments . When it comes to reducing threats to our NN , the NN , and biodiversity , we VBP that the tools of protecting intact forests and reducing forest degradation work well . The NN -- and all its citizens and leaders -- must embrace natural solutions to head off these three crises . Proactively conserving and restoring our remaining intact ecosystems represents a key strategy to halt NN NN , biodiversity loss , and -- we must hope -- the next NN . This article has been updated to clarify that the authors argue ending commercial wildlife trade for JJ consumption , specifically , MD mitigate JJ exposure to pathogens . It has RB been updated to reflect that James Watson is a professor , not associate professor , of conservation NN at the NNP of Queensland ."

The NNP ’s NN has warmed by more than 0.8 °C over the past century , and by approximately 0.6 °C in the past three decades . 1 This NN has been linked to more extreme NN conditions such as intense floods and droughts , heavier and more frequent storms , and a possible increase in frequency and intensity of the El Niño Southern Oscillation . These NNS are largely caused by JJ activities , mainly the burning of fossil fuels releasing NN dioxide ( CO2 ) that traps heat within the atmosphere . These CO2 NNS continue to rise , and NN models project the average NN NN will rise by 1.1 °C to 6.4 °C over the 21st century . 2 Since 1990 , WHO has published a series of reports on NN NN and has participated in review processes such as the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP . These activities have outlined four key characteristics of the NN risks generated by a NN and a more variable NN . RB , these hazards are diverse , JJ and probably irreversible over JJ NN scales . They range from increased risks of extreme NN , such as fatal heat waves , floods and storms , to less dramatic but potentially more serious effects on infectious NN dynamics , shifts to JJ - term drought conditions in JJ regions , melting of glaciers that supply freshwater to JJ population centres , and NN level increases leading to salination of sources of agriculture and drinking NN . Second , the NN impacts of NN NN are potentially huge . JJ of the most important JJ killers are highly sensitive to climatic conditions . Malaria , diarrhoea and NN - NN malnutrition together VBP more than 3 CD deaths each NN . 3 Third , these risks are inequitable , in that the NN gases that VBP NN NN originate mainly from developed NNS , but the NN risks are concentrated in the poorest nations , which have contributed least to the problem . 4 Finally , JJ of the projected impacts on NN are avoidable , through a combination of JJ NN interventions in the short term , support for NN measures in NN - related sectors such as agriculture and NN management , and a JJ - term strategy to reduce JJ impacts on NN . Threats to NN are often cited to justify actions to mitigate or adapt to NN NN ; for example , NNP Nations Secretary - General Kofi Annan ’s 2006 speech in Nairobi.5 For all the attention that these issues receive , however , a comprehensive strategy to support a JJ NN response is conspicuously lacking . This strategy is urgently needed , both because the NN community has a duty to counter emerging threats , and because increased attention to NN NN offers opportunities to focus on the most disadvantaged populations ’ current needs . For example , the international community has agreed on the principle of a JJ NN NN NN fund , funded by a 2 % levy on a multibillion - dollar Clean Development Mechanism .6 However , this opportunity to strengthen JJ NN can be seized only if the NN sector knows what it should do differently because of NN NN . The development of a comprehensive strategy will take NN , but some essential principles are already clear . A JJ problem requires a strategy of international dimensions that can translate into regional and local actions . Just as NN NN ’s underlying causes are JJ , its NN implications do not respect national boundaries . Impacts in CD location , such as infectious NN epidemics or population displacements caused by droughts or rising NN levels , quickly spread across national borders . Coordinated investments in preventive measures therefore contribute to the “ JJ JJ good ” of reducing the NN of NN emergencies . The challenge is simplified somewhat by the fact that NN NN is expected to lead mainly to NNS in existing NN issues rather than to the emergence of JJ and unfamiliar diseases . An important guiding principle therefore is to increase the priority given to currently important NN burdens that are likely to be worsened by NN NN . Such a “ no regrets ” strategy will bring important JJ NN benefits under any plausible future NN conditions . NN to NN NN is essentially a matter of basic JJ NN protection . The challenges of rapid JJ , demographic and JJ NNS all call for greater emphasis on NN prevention , providing a better balance with the current focus on curative and reactive measures . The necessary preventive actions to deal with most NN - sensitive diseases are already quite clear . NN NN and other JJ stresses should VB to refocus JJ and financial commitments to implement these measures . CD emerging JJ NN threat is the decline in JJ freshwater resources , caused mainly by increasing rates of NN extraction and contamination . NN NN is expected to worsen this decline in NN quality and quantity , particularly in already dry regions such as the eastern Mediterranean and north Africa . Scaling up NN and sanitation services and providing point - of - use disinfection MD reduce the current burden of NN and ameliorate the NN impacts of decreasing NN supplies . Such interventions already have a very high cost–benefit ratio; 7 the threat of NN NN makes these preventive NN measures an RB wiser investment . As NN stresses intensify , governments MD protect NN by strengthening and enforcing their regulatory frameworks to ensure the safe use of JJ NN sources that will become increasingly important : wastewater , excreta and greywater in agriculture and aquaculture . 8 Effective surveillance and response systems are essential in managing any infectious NN , but they become RB more important under conditions of rapid NN . These conditions include climatic shifts as well as increasing rates of movement of and contact between NNS , pathogens and reservoirs . These conditions all require improved JJ NN surveillance integrated with monitoring of NN and other JJ conditions that favour NN outbreaks , including NN in wildlife and agricultural animals . NN NN RB strengthens the NN for reinforcing response systems for infectious NN outbreaks , including predefined NN plans and maintenance of the NN resources and personnel capacity necessary to mount effective responses . The impacts of current and future natural disasters MD be reduced by the NN sector defining integrated measures that address the root causes of vulnerability , and planning for effective responses after such events . For example , the NN impacts of floods can be reduced by land management policies that reduce deforestation and conserve the integrity of watersheds and coastal zones , minimize the physical impacts of mudslides and storm surges , and decrease the chances of sewage contamination . Post - flooding NN effects can be reduced by adequately planned and funded NN - sector responses , including interventions to VB outbreaks of vector - borne and NN - related diseases . Since 2000 , WHO has worked with the NNP Meteorological Organization and the UN Environment Programme to raise awareness of NN NN ’s implications for the NN sectors of highly vulnerable regions . The necessary next step is to inform and support national NN actors in taking concrete actions to protect NN . For example , WHO is addressing this NN by initiating a JJ project in 2006 on piloting approaches to protect NN in changing climates .9 In partnership with the UN Development Programme and with funding from the NNP NNP Facility , this initiative is being implemented in seven vulnerable NNS . In each , the national NN ministry chairs an intersectoral team that has identified priority NN risks from NN NN given local JJ socioeconomic and NN contexts . Through the course of the initiative , this team will RB identify , implement , monitor and refine interventions to minimize NN risks . The project will thereby support targeted interventions in these NNS , strengthen institutional capacity to address NN risks , involve an increasingly informed and engaged NN sector in adapting to NN NN , and extract lessons that are applicable to other NNS . It will RB develop monitoring mechanisms to ensure that resources are applied effectively in NN projects within the NN sector , and inform evaluations of support through this mechanism as compared with more general NN or development aid . This initiative is important preparation for the wider NN that will be necessary to meet the worldwide challenge of adapting to NN risks from NN NN . The actions described above represent “ safe investments ” for NN NN NN funds within the NN sector . However , JJ climatic risks to NN lie at least partly outside the NN sector ’s normal sphere of NN . Perhaps most critically , NN NN has the capacity to suppress agricultural yields , with the greatest risks in Africa,10 where malnutrition is already the largest single contributor to NN burdens . 11 Some of the most effective actions by NN professionals MD therefore involve supporting other sectors ’ efforts to mitigate and adapt to NN NN . Much work still needs to be done in this area , including : Ultimately , however , the JJ NN community needs to VB beyond reacting to a changing NN . A JJ preventive strategy needs to ensure the maintenance and development of healthy environments from local to JJ levels . In the JJ term , sustainable development and protection of ecosystem services are fundamentally necessary for JJ NN .13 This is not just a NN of protecting future generations , as RB in the short term development choices that protect the NN can benefit JJ NN significantly . The intersection of NN , transport , NN and NN provides an example of this . The Stern Review of the economics of NN NN argues that the JJ - term benefits of major investments to cut NN gas NNS MD vastly outweigh their costs , and that these are needed to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts on the JJ economy . 12 This coincides with a WHO assessment that feasible improvements in JJ conditions MD reduce the JJ NN burden by more than 25%.14 Much of the current burden is due to unhealthy NN and transport services . Changing these systems to reduce NN NN MD therefore RB bring significant and largely unacknowledged JJ NN gains . Improving access to JJ and active transport MD greatly reduce CO2 NNS , while RB cutting the 800 CD annual JJ deaths from outdoor air pollution , the 1.2 CD annual deaths from traffic accidents , and the 1.9 CD deaths from physical inactivity . 11 Changing the poorest communities ’ domestic NN technologies MD reduce the 1.5 CD annual indoor air pollution deaths . 15 The critical next stage for the NN community is a more direct and assertive engagement with the environment and JJ sectors to ensure that NN - supporting technological and development choices are implemented . JJ - induced NN NN is an emerging threat that rightly commands widespread policy and JJ attention . Along with other rapid NNS associated with JJ population and JJ growth , NN NN strains existing weak points in NN protection systems and calls for reconsideration of JJ NN priorities . The most effective responses are likely to be strengthening of the key functions of JJ management , surveillance and response to safeguard NN from natural disasters and NNS in infectious NN patterns , and a more pro-active approach to ensure that development decisions serve the ultimate goal of improving JJ NN .16 For the most part these are not JJ interventions but existing tools underutilized due to the “ JJ killers ” : lack of JJ commitment and of financial resources . 17 NN NN therefore demands that we intensify our efforts in preventive JJ NN and place that crucial task at the core of sustainable development . ■ • NN NN analysis : analysis graphs and plots .

NN chief VBZ NN leaders must recognize there is no option except to speed - up and scale - up NN to tackle JJ NN , warning that continuing on the current path will lead to “ a catastrophe . ” Patricia Espinosa stressed in CD recent interviews with the Associated Press that NN NNS are saying there ’s still a chance to make things RB “ but the window of opportunity is closing very soon ” and the NN has 12 NNS until NN NNS reach “ a point of no return . ” That means the NN needs to accelerate all efforts to keep from reaching that level , “ and therefore all efforts are absolutely indispensable ” to cut NN NNS and keep NNS from rising , she VBD . Some top NNS VBP reaching the “ tipping point ” in 12 NNS is an oversimplification of a U.N. report last NN . Espinosa VBD NN NNS were expected to rise in the immediate future after the landmark Paris agreement was adopted in 2015 to address NN NN because the transformations needed to VB to a downward trajectory “ cannot be done overnight . ” In addition , JJ population is growing and more NNS demand more NN and resources , she VBD . “ What has become clear , however , is that if we continue to grow or to behave in a NN that this kind of trajectory is maintained we will not be able to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement , ” VBD Espinosa , who is executive secretary of the NNP Nations Framework Convention on NNP NNP . The Paris agreement called for JJ NNS to rise a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) . The NN has already warmed 1 degree Celsius , so the goal is RB about preventing another 1 or 0.5 degrees Celsius ( 1.8 or 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit ) increase from now . A report last NN by the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP , or IPCC , concluded that while it ’s technically possible to cap JJ NN at 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) by the end of the century , it is highly unlikely because this MD require a dramatic overhaul of the JJ economy , including a shift away from fossil fuels . Deep in the report , NNS VBP less than 2 % of 529 of their calculated possible future scenarios kept VBG below the 1.5 degree C ( 2.7 degrees F ) goal . “ What NN is showing now since Paris is that 1.5 degrees C is RB necessary because the consequences of staying at 2 degrees C are very JJ , ” Espinosa VBD . “ And secondly , it is RB showing that 1.5 degrees C is possible . It takes more effort . It takes much more JJ will . ” She VBD the IPCC NNS gave the NN 12 NNS “ to speed - up and scale - up the actions ” to cut NNS before they start spiraling out of NN . “ It does n’t mean that we VBP to wait 12 NNS and then look at it as the moment to do this , ” Espinosa VBD . “ It means that we VBP to accelerate the tipping point , and therefore all efforts are absolutely indispensable . ” The U.N. report does not VB 2030 , the date VBN , is a last chance , hard deadline for NN , as it has been interpreted in some quarters . The panel “ did not VB we have 12 NNS left to save the NN , ” James Skea , co-chairman of the report and professor of sustainable NN at Imperial College London , VBD The Associated Press . “ The hotter it gets , the worse it gets , but there is no cliff edge . ” “ This has been a persistent source of confusion , ” agreed Kristie L. Ebi , director of the Center for NNP and the NNP Environment at the NNP of NNP in Seattle . “ The report never VBD we only have 12 NNS left . ” Espinosa VBD in an interview Tuesday that the attention the issue is getting “ is clearly growing ” but not “ at the speed and the breadth that it should . ” Governments VBP trapped in dealing with immediate needs “ and we are not yet in a situation where we can VB we have a broad understanding that the threat to NN NN is part of those immediate needs , ” Espinosa VBD . She VBD communities that suffer destruction from the effects of NN NN have woken up , the movement by NNS from schools IN the NN is “ a wake - up call , ” and mass protests to combat NN NN will hopefully spur decision - makers . But Espinosa VBD some NNS VBP NN NN is n’t happening , “ this is not man-made , ” and “ others are just very , very indifferent to the issue . ” “ So we have a lot of work to do to still to VB everybody on board , ” she VBD . “ We have a very JJ , JJ NN to VB . ” Espinosa stressed that the goal is “ to VB to a moment where leaders recognize that there is no option . ” “ The truth is that if we continue to produce , consume , to function as we are doing now , we VBP that we are VBG toward a catastrophe , ” she VBD , and that will mean loss of lives , serious impacts on JJ sectors of the economy , massive displacement and instability . Leaders must understand “ that the business as usual scenario is not an option anymore , ” she VBD .

NN is supposed to be reliable , VBN upon fact , unprejudiced , and trustworthy , is n’t it ? Well , VB again . A lot of what passes for NN these days is utter nonsense , pseudo - NN ( i.e. , JJ NN ) , and a lot of scientific fact is hidden from JJ view because it ’s not politically correct . It is absurdly comical what is commonly mislabeled as “ NN ” these days . The “ Discovery ” channel recently produced a laughable documentary on Greenland 's alleged “ melting glaciers . ” Oh boy ! Here we VBP again with JJ NN . It 's RB a comedy . A team was flown in by helicopter to actually install special plastic covers over a 2 - acre area to reflect the NN ’s rays and VB prevent the glacier from melting . They spent 3 - days in 60 M.P.H. gusts of frigid wind , in chill factors well below zero , with millions of dollars worth of equipment and materials , to cover a mere 2 - acres of the glacier . That ’s IN covering CD grain of sand on the biggest beach in the NN . They VBD it MD cost $ 186,000,000,000 just to cover a JJ fraction of Greenland ’s glaciers to combat the effects of JJ NN . Their major concern was that such a project MD RB require 21,000,000 helicopter trips , which MD dump enormous amounts of NN Dioxide ( i.e. NN gases ) into the atmosphere . The whole idea of preventing a glacier from melting is insane ! If indeed the NN ’s glaciers are melting , attempting to stop them from melting by covering them with reflective material MD n’t work . According to JJ NN proponents the NN ’s NN is increasing . So what good MD it do to cover the glaciers ? The NN ’s rays are not the problem . This just shows the fallacy of JJ NN . CD minute they claim that the NN ’s NN is rising , and then they set out to protect Greenland ’s glaciers from the NN ’s rays . Well , which is it , the NN ’s rays or the higher NNS on NN ? If , as JJ NN proponents claim , the NN ’s NNS are rising , then protecting glaciers from the NN ’s rays is a complete waste of NN and NN . I ’ve been reading about a “ JJ NN tax ” for some NN now and I VBP this is the ultimate goal of all this scare - mongering … an international JJ NN tax ! If you VBP the truth behind any agenda … follow the NN . It 's just a matter of NN . Our taxes should n't be wasted on junk NN . You VBP , why did n’t we hear about JJ NN 30 - NNS ago ? Has NN NN changed that much in just a few decades ? No ! CD violent volcanic eruption emits more gases and pollution into the NN ’s atmosphere than all the cars and industries in NNP combined in just a single NN . The NN itself generates enough radiation to penetrate the NN ’s crust and maintain a molten core of lava . Who ’s kidding who ? How did mankind survive for Millenniums without combating the NNP NNP boogie NN ? RB the founder of the NNP channel and a lifelong meteorologist , John Coleman , has candidly stated publicly that JJ NN is a JJ scam . I ’ve quoted the entire article here because it ’s something that everyone needs to read … It is the greatest scam in history . I am amazed , appalled and highly offended by it . JJ NN ; It is a SCAM . Some dastardly NNS with JJ and JJ motives manipulated JJ term scientific NNS back in the late 1990's to create an allusion of rapid JJ NN . Other NNS of the same JJ wacko type jumped into the circle to support and broaden the "" research "" to further enhance the totally slanted , bogus JJ NN claims . Their friends in NN steered huge research grants their NN to keep the movement VBG . Soon they claimed to be a consensus . JJ extremist , notable politicians among them then teamed up with movie , NN and other liberal , environmentalist journalists to create this wild "" scientific "" scenario of the civilization threatening JJ consequences from JJ NN unless we adhere to their radical agenda . Now their ridicules manipulated NN has been accepted as fact and become a cornerstone issue for CNN , CBS , NBC , the Democratic NNP Party , the Governor of California , school teachers and , in JJ NNS , well informed but very gullible JJ conscientious citizens . Only CD reporter at ABC has been allowed to counter the NNP NNP frenzy with CD 15 minutes documentary segment . I do not oppose environmentalism . I do not oppose the JJ positions of either party . However , NNP NNP , i.e. NNP NNP , is not about environmentalism or politics . It is not a religion . It is not something you "" VB in . "" It is NN ; the NN of meteorology . This is my field of NN - JJ expertise . And I am telling you JJ NN is a nonevent , a manufactured NN and a total scam . I VBP this knowing you probably wo n't VB me , a mere TV weatherman , challenging a Nobel Prize , Academy Award and Emmy Award winning JJ Vice NNP of NNP NNPS . So be it . I suspect you might VB to VB to me , "" John , look the research that supports the NN for JJ NN was done by research NNS ; NNS with PH D's in Meteorology . They are employed by major universities and important research institutions . Their work has been reviewed by other NNS with PH D's . They have to VB a lot more about it than you do . Come on , John , VB with it . The experts VBP our pollution has created an strong and increasing NN effect and a rapid , out of NN JJ NN is underway that will sky rocket NNS , destroy agriculture , melt the NN caps , flood the coastlines and end NN as we VBP it . How can you dissent from this NN ? You must be a bit nutty . Allow me , please , to explain how I VBP this all came about . Our universities have become somewhat isolated from the rest of us . There is a culture and attitudes and values and pressures on campus that are very JJ . I VBP this group well . My father and my older brother were both PHD - NNP types . I was raised in the NN culture . Any person who spends a decade at a NN obtaining a PHD in Meteorology and become a research scientist , more likely than not , becomes a part of that single minded culture . They all look askance at the rest of us , certain of their superiority . They respect NN and disrespect business , particularly JJ business . They are environmentalists above all else . And , there is something else . These NNS VBP that if they do research and results are in no NN alarming , their research will gather dust on the shelf and their research careers will languish . But if they do research that sounds alarms , they will become well VBN and respected and receive scholarly awards and , very importantly , more research dollars will come flooding their NN . So when these researchers did NN NN studies in the late 90's they were eager to produce findings that MD be important and be widely noticed and trigger more research funding . It was easy for them to manipulate the NNS to come up with the results they wanted to make headlines and at the same NN drive their JJ agendas . Then their JJ minded PHD colleagues reviewed their work and hastened to endorse it without question . There were a few who did n't fit the mold . They did ask questions and raised objections . They did research with contradictory results . The JJ elitists berated them brushed their studies aside . I have learned since the NNP Age is coming scare in the 1970's to always be a skeptic about research . In the NN of JJ NN , I did n't accept NN accounts . Instead I read dozens of the scientific papers . I have talked with numerous NNS . I have studied . I have thought about it . I VBP I am correct when I assure you there is no run away NN NN . The impact of NNS on NN is not catastrophic . Our NN is not in peril . It is all a scam , the result of bad NN . I am not alone in this assessment . There are hundreds of other meteorologists , JJ of them PH D's , who are as certain as I am that this JJ NN frenzy is VBN on bad NN and is not valid . I am incensed by the incredible NN glamour , the politically correct silliness and rude dismal of counter arguments by the high priest of NNP NNP . In NN , a decade or CD , the outrageous scam will be obvious . As the NN rises , polar NN cap melting , coastal flooding and super storm pattern all fail to occur as predicted everyone will come to realize we have been duped . The sky is not falling . And , natural cycles and drifts in NN are as much if not more responsible for any NN NNS underway . I strongly VBP that the next twenty NNS are equally as likely to VB a cooling trend as they are to VB a VBG trend . NN has been politicized — not by the NN ; but by the Left , which sees JJ NN , Darwinism , stem cell research , and innumerable other issues as tools to advance its agenda ( and in JJ NNS expand the reach of NN ) . When liberals parade out NNS with white coats , debate is supposed to be silenced . But JJ of the high priests of NN have something to hide — from blind intolerance of Biblical claims to greedy guarding of their federally financed research budgets . What a waste of tax - payer NN ! "" NNP "" means "" the NN of "" something . Therefore , to qualify as legitimate NN , there MUST be something to VB . Evolution is a perfect example of JJ NN . There is nothing to VB in evolution . Evolution CANNOT be studied ! It CANNOT be tested ? It CANNOT be monitored or examined ? In fact , all available scientific NN shows that evolution is NOT JJ in the least . In the same manner , NNP NNP is bad NN , i.e. , there are NO solid scientific research findings to support their doomsday scenario . The “ NN ” at best is far - fetched and purely circumstantial . I remember hearing NNP Gore claim several NNS back that massive flooding in NNP was caused by JJ NN . Such alleged “ NN ” of JJ NN is ridiculous . Suspiciously , Gore and other JJ NN proponents have remained silent concerning record - breaking cold NNS in recent NNS . For example : In 2007 NNP NNP City set an all - NN low record of 59 degrees for the month of August . In January of 2004 , Boston 's Logan International Airport recorded a low of 3 below zero , CD degrees chillier than the previous record for January CD , set in 1875 . It was the city 's coldest day since January 16 , 1994 , when thermometers registered 4 below . Meanwhile , on that day in NNP NNP City , NNP Gore was giving a speech about the effects of JJ NN ! In 2007 , Chicago experienced the 6th coldest February on record since 1871 and the coldest February in nearly three decades . JJ NN ? You decide ! Historical NN records clearly VBP that there are normal “ cycles ” of short - term and JJ - term NN patterns . Thus such terms as “ El Nino ” ( warmer ) and “ La Nina ” ( cooler ) are VBN to identify the normal NN NN patterns in the ocean . It is sad that JJ NNS are gullible enough to VB JJ NN exists simply because someone shows them a NN of NN flowing from a glacier . I remember as a kid seeing snow melting on the rooftop of the NN and draining into the guitars , RB though it was close to zero degrees outside . I noticed that JJ icicles dripped from the heat of NN , RB though it was only CD degrees outside . So why should it be surprising that NN should flow from a glacier when the NN shines upon it ? It is normal . I saw a bumper sticker the other day which read ... "" I VBP the NNP Bang NNP ... NNP spoke and BANG , it happened . "" I thought that was pretty good , and it is certainly Biblical . It is far more reasonable to VB the Bible ; than it is to VB the hocus - pocus nonsense of a bunch of whacko NNS . Just as Evolution , NNP NNP is a scam — a cleverly devised invention of greedy and dishonest NNS ."

They VBP that because the NN wo n’t exist when they retire ( because of NN NN ) there ’s no NN to save any NN . But if we apply that logic to everything , there is never a NN to prepare for the future of anything and the liberal ideology crumbles upon itself . NNP Watch VBD a young professional as an example of this flawed thinking . Lori Rodriguez , a 27 - NN - old communications professional in NNP NNP City , is not saving for retirement , and it is n’t necessarily because she can’t afford to , but because she does n’t expect it to matter . IN JJ NNS her age , Rodriguez has bought into the propaganda and religiously believes that NN NN will have catastrophic effects on our NN . Some 88 % of millennials ( a higher percentage than any other age group ) VBP in the NN NN religion and 69 % VBP it will impact them in their lifetimes . “ I VBP to hope for the best and plan for a future that is stable and secure , but , when I look at current events and at the NN we are predicting , I do not VB how things MD not be chaotic in 50 NNS , ” Rodriguez VBZ . Author and real estate entrepreneur Stefan Aarnio joins Owen Shroyer live via Skype to discuss his book “ Hard Times Create Strong Men ” and reveal how to be an alpha male in the age of toxic feminism . “ The NN systems are already off , and I do n’t VB it ’s hyperbolic to be a little apocalyptic . ” The mainstream NN is n’t helping either . VBG manipulation techniques , the NN engulfs NNS in a constant barrage of depressing and hate - filled NN stories . So much so , that JJ young NNS are skeptical about saving for a future they are constantly being VBN wo n’t exist . Just to clarify for these younger NNS , in 2008 liberal hero NNP Gore predicted that there MD be no polar NN caps in three to five NNS because of JJ NN . However , the “ inconvenient truth ” is that the NN caps are still there today ( over ten NNS later ) . Interestingly enough , RB after stating that younger Americans do n’t save for retirement because they VBP NN NN will destroy the NN , NN Watchclarified that mental NN MD be an issue . Jean Twenge , who authored the NN cited by NNP Watch , VBZ this spike in mental NN issues MD be attributed to the increased use of digital NN . Technology has changed modes of indoctrination just enough to impact JJ lives and communication . Millennials are RB VBN to suffer from “ eco-anxiety , ” according to a 2018 report from the NNP Psychological Association , with 72 % saying their emotional well - being is affected by the inevitability of NN NN , compared with just 57 % of NNS over the age of 45 . CD - thirds of millennials ( defined by Pew as the generation born between 1981 and 1996 ) have nothing saved for retirement , according to the National Institute on Retirement Security . And now we VBP why some are n’t saving . The religion of NN NN has a death grip on their mental stability . It is n’t that we do n’t VB to take the NN . Those who do n’t subscribe to the NN NN religion of hysteria simply VBP that NNS should care for the NNP the best NN they can . Putting the NNP ’s salvation in the hands of a few bureaucrats is n’t VBG to solve anything . After all , NN officials can’t RB clean up a trash pile in the Democrat ’s paradise of Los Angeles . If NN NN was RB a problem , there ’s no NN authoritarians MD solve it nor MD they VB too . There ’s just too much NN to be made off the gullible masses . Some NNS just VBP to watch the NN burn .

These rising NNS threaten CD of the largest JJ - term stores of NN on land : permafrost . Permafrost is permanently frozen soil . The generally cold NNS in the Arctic keep soils there frozen NN - on - NN . Plants grow in the uppermost soil layers during the short summers and then decay into soil , which freezes when the winter snow arrives . Over thousands of NNS , NN has built up in these frozen soils , and they ’re now estimated to contain twice the NN currently in the atmosphere . Some of this NN is more than 50,000 NNS old , which means the plants that decomposed to produce that soil grew over 50,000 NNS ago . These soil deposits are VBN as “ Yedoma ” , which are mainly VBN in the East Siberian Arctic , but RB in parts of Alaska and Canada . As the region warms , the permafrost is thawing , and this frozen NN is being released to the atmosphere as NN dioxide and methane . Methane release is particularly worrying , as it ’s a highly potent NN gas . But a recent NN suggested that the release of methane from ancient NN sources – sometimes referred to as the Arctic methane “ bomb ” – did n’t contribute much to the NN that occurred during the last deglaciation – the period after the last NN age . This occurred 18,000 to 8,000 NNS ago , a period that NN NNS VBP intently , as it ’s the last NN JJ NNS rose by 4°C , which is roughly what is predicted for the NN by 2100 . This NN suggested to JJ that ancient methane NNS are not something we should be worried about this century . But in JJ research , we VBD that this optimism MD be misplaced . Read more : The Arctic is turning brown because of weird NN – and it MD accelerate NN NN We went to the East Siberian Arctic to compare the age of JJ forms of NN VBN in the ponds , rivers and lakes . These waters thaw during the summer and leak NN gases from the surrounding permafrost . We measured the age of the NN dioxide , methane and organic matter VBN in these waters VBG radiocarbon dating and VBD that most of the NN released to the atmosphere was overwhelmingly “ young ” . Where there was intense permafrost thaw , we VBD that the oldest methane was 4,800 NNS old , and the oldest NN dioxide was 6,000 NNS old . But over this vast Arctic landscape , the NN released was mainly from young plant organic matter . This means that the NN produced by plants growing during each summer growing season is rapidly released over the next few summers . This rapid turnover releases much more NN than the thaw of older permafrost , RB where severe thaw is occurring . So what does this mean for future NN NN ? It means that NN NNS from a NN Arctic MD not be driven by the thawing of an ancient frozen NN bomb , as it ’s often described . Instead , most NNS MD be relatively JJ NN that is produced by plants that grew fairly recently . What this shows is that the age of the NN released from the NN Arctic is less important than the amount and form it takes . Methane is 34 times more potent than NN dioxide as a NN gas over a 100 - NN timeframe . The East Siberian Arctic is a generally JJ and wet landscape , and these are conditions which produce lots of methane , as there ’s less oxygen in soils which might otherwise create NN dioxide during thaws instead . As a result , potent methane MD well dominate the NN gas NNS from the region . Since most of the NNS from the Arctic this century will likely be from “ young ” NN , we MD not VB to worry about ancient permafrost adding substantially to modern NN NN . But the Arctic will still be a huge source of NN NNS , as NN that was soil or plant matter only a few hundred NNS ago leaches to the atmosphere . That will increase as warmer NNS lengthen growing seasons in the Arctic summer . The fading spectre of an ancient methane NN bomb is cold comfort . The JJ research should urge the NN to act boldly on NN NN , to limit how much natural processes in the Arctic can contribute to the problem ."

But before his appearance , Thunberg underlined the message that has inspired millions IN the NN — that governments are failing to wake up to the reality of NN NN . “ We are all fighting for the environment and NN . If you VBP it from a bigger perspective , basically nothing has been done . It will require much more than this . This is just the very beginning , ” she VBD . Speaking calmly and with a wry smile , Thunberg acknowledged that her campaign which began with school strikes had attracted huge attention without yet achieving NN . “ There is a difference between being heard to actually leading to something , ” she VBD . “ I am not the person who should complain about not being heard , ” she VBD to appreciative laughter . “ I am being heard all the NN . But the NN and the voice of the young NNS are not at the centre of the conversation , ” she added . The forum ’s own JJ Risks report published last week warned that “ NN NN is striking harder and more rapidly than JJ expected ” with JJ NNS on track to increase by at least three degrees Celsius ( 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit ) towards the end of the century . There are no expectations that NNP and Thunberg , who have exchanged barbs through NNP , will actually meet , but the crowded venue and intense schedule mean a chance encounter cannot be ruled out . When NNP and his entourage walked through UN headquarters last NN at the annual General Assembly , a photo of the teenager staring in apparent fury at the NN from the sidelines went viral . Tweeting as he headed to Davos , NNP appeared in bullish mood , writing he MD “ bring Good Policy and additional Hundreds of Billions of Dollars back to the NNP NNPS of NNP ! ” “ We are now NUMBER CD in the Universe , by FAR !! he added . Sustainability is the buzzword at the forum , which began in 1971 , with heel crampons handed out to participants to encourage them to walk on the icy streets rather than use cars , and the signage paint made out of seaweed . NNP ’s opposition to renewable NN , his withdrawal from the Paris NN accord negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama , and the free hand extended to the fossil fuel industry puts him at odds with the entire thrust of the event . Business leaders attending the forum will be keen to tout their awareness on NN NN but are likely RB to be concerned by the NN of the JJ economy whose prospects , according to the IMF , have improved but remain brittle . The IMF cut its JJ growth estimate for 2020 to 3.3 percent , saying that a recent truce in the trade NN between NNP and the US had brought some stability but that risks remained . “ We are already seeing some tentative signs of stabilisation but we have not reached a turning point yet , ” VBD IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva . Activists meanwhile will be pressing for much more concrete NN to fight inequality , after Oxfam issued a report outlining how the number of billionaires has doubled in the past decade and the NN ’s 22 richest men now have more wealth than all the women in Africa . Greenpeace meanwhile complained that some of the NN ’s biggest banks , insurers and pension funds have collectively invested $ 1.4 trillion in fossil fuel NNS since the Paris NN deal . Other key priorities will be exploring how to battle biodiversity loss , narrow the digital divide between the internet haves and have nots and step up the fight against pandemics in the face of NN hesitancy and drug resistance . “ I am angry about the NN of the NN but I am RB determined to engage and provide solutions and deliver , ” WWF director general Marco Lambertini VBD AFP . “ There needs to be healthy balance between these CD sentiments . ”"

Follow_VB Waking_NNP Times_NNP on_IN Twitter_NNP ._.","Mainstream Scientist Exposes the Dangerous Reality of Chemtrails and Geoengineering Over the past few NNS , the issue of geoengineering has been popularized . Mainstream NN , academia , and NN almost unanimously support the idea of geoengineering as a perceived solution to NN NN while suppressing the NN that it has actually been in use for some NN without our consent . On the other hand , there is a growing number of NNS who are slowly beginning to understand the reality surrounding chemtrail geoengineering , and opposition is slowly growing . In a bold move against the establishment , Kate Marvel , a mainstream scientist who specializes in “ NN NN , ” spoke out at a Ted Talk against the onset of NN engineering with chemtrails , RB VBN as Solar Radiation Management or “ SRM . ” Firstly , computer theorist and founding partner of tech NN Applied Invention , Danny Hillis , came on stage and proposed a number of geoengineering concepts which MD theoretically , “ turn down the NN of the NN . ” These included sending giant parasols into NN , putting fizzy NN into the ocean , and sending chalk into the atmosphere at a rate of CD teragrams per NN to reflect sunlight and in NN slow the effects of NN NN . Now enters Kate Marvel with the opening line , “ Danny , you seem so nice , and I hope we can be friends , and you terrify me . ” Marvel RB noted that atmospheric spraying MD not do anything to effect other JJ problems such as ocean acidification . GeoEngineering refers to technologies which are VBN with the intention of interfering with the NN ’s atmosphere in order to alter NNS and NN . Most of these technologies are still in theoretical stages , however a growing body of NN suggests that some NN modification technologies such as aerosol spraying or “ cloud seeding ” have been in production for JJ decades . Almost no studies have been done which assess the effect that cloud seeding has on JJ safety or JJ NN , which shows that the NN has been VBG untested technologies on the population without our consent . In CD , NNP Director John O. Brennan spoke at a Council on Foreign Relations conference about the benefits of geoengineering . However , any mention of potential negative impacts as a result of cloud seeding was conveniently left out . Although we are all hearing from establishment figures IN Brennan that NN engineering is a JJ technology which we all have the option to accept or decline before it is implemented , that is simply not the NN . NN VBG as far back as the early 1920 ’s shows a push to develop the technology needed to VB the NN and has been implemented in some form since at least the 1970’s . This NN has been uncovered in various forms , CD of those being patents which range from April 27th of 1920 to NNP of 2003 showing interest in the development of various forms of NN modification technologies . Documents have RB been uncovered which show NN involvement in SRM since 1947 . NN NN Alarmism Opens The Door To Reactionary Solutions Such As SRM The geoengineering debate can be summed up in three words : “ Problem , Reaction , Solution . ” RB , the dire problem of NNP NNP is presented by figures IN NNP Gore , then a reaction is generated from the NN in the form of “ NN Ca n’t Wait ! ” slogans and JJ unrest , then the solution of GeoEngineering is presented which gives more NN to the powerful and hurts the NNS in the form of JJ degradation and potential NN implications which the document from earlier lists as : “ 1. Cloud seeding has been responsible for the great 5 - NN drought in the Northeast NNP NNPS . 2 . Isolated sections in the Northeast have experienced 18 NNS of drought due to cloud seeding . 3 . NN disturbances in the South Atlantic [ sic ] have been eliminated and has reduced [ sic ] the east coast ’s rainfall by 30 percent – rain that is needed if agriculture is to be successful . 4 . The average dairy farmer on the east coast , living in an area of cloud seeding , has averaged a net financial loss because of cloud seeding . 5 . Crop production losses in Franklin County , Pa. , alone have amounted to $ 50 CD . 6 . When effects of seeding wear off , cloudbursts occur , causing floods , destroying crops , buildings , and drowning NNS as well as livestock . 7 . Seeding has been responsible for the serious air pollution problems . 8 . Mental retardation and insanity are traceable to cloud seeding chemicals . 9 . Poisoning of all living matter is directly related to cloud seeding . LS . Emphysema is three times higher in areas of heavy cloud seeding . 11 . Cancer is virulently out of proportion . 12 . Financial losses to agriculture and related industries run into the billions . 13 . Forest trees as well as cultivated orchards are dying from chemical reactions taking place in the air due to the addition of cloud seeding agents . ” We often hear predictions surrounding NN NN by so - called “ experts ” IN NNP Gore who claimed that the Arctic MD become “ NN - free ” by 2013 . Ironically , in CD a JJ NN expedition to the Arctic was forced to turn RB due to record NN . There are real solutions to JJ problems which do n’t end up harming us or the environment further . It is NN for NNS to stand up for themselves and reject dangerous and untested technologies IN these . Phillip Schneider is a student and a staff writer for Waking Times .

It ’s hard to find litter of any kind . But venture into the island ’s cities , drive along its roads , or peek inside a drainage ditch , and plastic trash is everywhere . Less visible trash MD make Dominica look cleaner , and a pristine Caribbean island is a place where tourists VBP to visit and spend NN . “ It MD be very simplistic to VB this is just about building back , ” VBZ Bardouille . “ I VBP there ’s a serious underestimation of the amount of trauma and post - traumatic stress , and the impact it had on the fabric of our society . We have to now look at the JJ strength of our nation , ” she VBZ . In 2018 , Dominica passed the NNP Resilience Act , which fully came into effect on the JJ day of 2019 , and in a budget address delivered last July the prime minister highlighted how far the country had come . The economy has grown by 9 percent . Tourism is on the rise . All schools are open . A JJ NN - of - the - art hospital welcomed patients in August . Five hundred JJ homes have been built and more than 1,000 are under construction . The NN expects banana production to return to pre-Maria levels , and , to ensure food security , distributed seeds to farmers for other staple crops IN dasheen , yams , potatoes , and passion fruit , which are are sold locally . It ’s Easter weekend in Scott ’s Head , and the sky is free of clouds . The ocean laps the shore with meditative regularity ; the wind barely moves . It ’s difficult to imagine the chaos that ripped this neighbourhood to shreds and left the island so destroyed that it was repeatedly described as a NN zone . Jelviel , whose home was rammed by a boat during the hurricane , shows me her NN , now mostly rebuilt .

During the Late Cretaceous , the continents were moving and major JJ mountain chains began to rise . JJ of the shallow Mesozoic seas dried up . Van Valen and Sloan suggest that this caused the NN 's NN to VB . NN from fossil plants at their Montana NN site suggests that it got about ten centigrade points colder in the Late Cretaceous . A NN decline that JJ MD affect the NN . It MD have become colder in the mountains , and JJ plants MD have replaced the warm - NN plants . Van Valen and Sloan have argued that dinosaurs were at a disadvantage in the JJ forests of coniferous trees . So , they left the mountains and moved toward the tropics , to a better NN . This NN suggests that the dinosaurs survived longer in the tropics than in the mountains . Because plants in the tropics survived , something else must have caused dinosaur extinction in these areas . CD suggestion is that placental mammals ( mammals that give live birth and have a placenta ) became abundant in the mountains , because they no longer competed with dinosaurs . Later , the mammals escaped these regions and went into the tropics , where they drove dinosaurs to extinction . There are problems with this NN . Some studies of foraminifera ( the shells of protozoans talked about earlier ) show that there was a short - term NN trend in the Late Cretaceous . But they are JJ about the JJ - term cooling trend . There is no NN that dinosaurs lasted longer in CD area than another . Although competition between animals MD explain the extinction of JJ living things at the end of the Cretaceous , other groups , especially the foraminifera , seem to have disappeared without competitors . Another NN NN NN is due to recent research . Some living reptiles , turtles and crocodiles , lay eggs . It was recently VBN that the sex of their offspring is decided by the NN of the nest . So if the same were JJ for dinosaurs , cooling NNS in the Late Cretaceous MD have caused all the young to be of the same sex , so the NNS MD not have been able to continue ."

Frazier is an NN reporter for The Allegheny Front , a Pittsburgh - VBN JJ NN outlet covering the environment in Pennsylvania . His work has aired on NPR and Marketplace . If you ’ve been following NN NN , the NN NN will feel oddly familiar these days . NNS , including the U.S. , have implemented radical policies that MD have been unthinkable a few weeks ago to slow the spread of the NN . Is this what it will take to solve the NN NN ? On the latest episode of our NNP on NNP podcast , CD NN reporter and writer VBZ the NN NN ca n’t be separated from the coming NN NN . Last NN Emily Atkin launched the HEATED newsletter which , in her words , is for NNS who are pissed off about NN NN . Atkin has now turned Heated into a podcast series about the intersection of NN NN and NN . It ’s running on the podcast feed for Drilled ( another NN - related podcast you should be listening to ) . She spoke with CD of the NNP on NNP podcast host , The Allegheny Front ’s Reid Frazier . Reid Frazier : Tell me about the podcast series and why you decided to do it . Emily Atkin : I was sitting here watching this JJ NN take over society , politics and our lives . And I was confused about how I should be approaching it as a NN journalist . I knew there were clear parallels : It ’s a problem that threatens millions of lives across the NN . NNS are telling us to act very rapidly and quickly , and yet we ’re not doing that . I wanted to talk to RB smart NNS about that . I figured I might as well record [ those conversations ] and make it available for other NNS to listen to so that we MD all figure it out together . RF : If you ’ve followed NN NN you VBP that this is a massive problem that requires collective NN on an unprecedented scale . There ’s a lot of resistance built - in ; resistance to changing our behaviors and our systems . How do you VB those problems as similar ? Do you VB JJ differences in how these problems manifest themselves or how they VBP to be looked at ? EA : I VBP the differences are good to VB out of the NN RB . NN is obviously hugely JJ in that it is much faster and the impacts to JJ NN are much more urgent . I VBP we ’re all VBG to VB NNS close to us either financially affected or affected in their NN . This is touching every aspect of our lives very obviously RB now , whereas NN NN is touching every aspect of our NN RB now , too , but it ’s a little less obvious day - to - day . The other thing is that with NN , we do n’t have as JJ of an industry whose whole livelihood depends on the NN keeping VBG . The pharmaceutical industry will be fine NN or not . The fossil fuel industry will not be fine if we solve NN NN because there will be no fossil fuel industry . But the JJ similarities here are that NN NN is a problem that wo n’t be solved unless we take RB radical NN very quickly on a JJ scale . It ca n’t be done without the biggest nations on NNP . It ’s a problem where millions of lives are threatened ; not only lives , but society in general . It ’s a problem where we have to listen to NNS . There are no compromises VBN on biology or physics . NN dioxide warms the atmosphere . If we VBP the atmosphere to stop NN , we VBP to reduce the amount of NN dioxide . Just the same , NN is a NN that attacks ourselves and that ’s why we VBP to stay away from each other . It ’s basic NN and physics . There are RB some JJ similarities : a reluctance to admit to the scale of the problem as we VBP it . I VBP we saw that with NN , where we all knew it was happening , but we were RP , ‘ but it ’s not VBG to affect me and I do n’t RB have to do anything . ’ NN is basically just NN NN sped up CD times over . It ’s IN NN NN on steroids . RF : As you mentioned , there ’s this resistance to listening to what the NNS are telling us . With NN NN , you can basically VB away with that for NNS . That is that the terrible thing about NN NN – the ramifications of our actions ( or inaction wo n’t be felt until the next generation . But , with NN , it ’s UH three weeks . EA : There ’s plausible deniability , too . When it comes to NN NN , deaths are happening now . Someone you love MD be RB affected by a hurricane or drought or a flooding event or heatwave . But there ’s some part of your brain that you MD compartmentalize and VB that it was n’t NN NN . It ’s not IN NN where if they die from NN , they die from NN . I VBP that ’s an important distinction to make when we ’re talking about who is VBG to be affected by NN NN . It ’s not that NNS are VBG to VB the effects down the line ; it ’s that NNS are VBG to start admitting to themselves that these are the effects down the line . We ’ve all focused our attention on this CD thing . But NN NN has n’t stopped . It ’s still happening and our efforts to combat it have just slowed . The fossil fuel industry is trying to take advantage of the NN and make sure they can survive when this is done . These are all things that we VBP to keep in NN as we ’re self - isolating and trying to deal with this NN . It ’s not that we ’ve replaced CD NN for the other , it ’s that now we have CD to deal with . RF : There ’s been an effort from JJ groups and some in the Democratic Party to infuse any recovery package with green policies , almost VB to kickstart a Green NNP Deal . What have you made of the debate about whether any recovery package should incentivize decarbonization or ramp up renewables ? EA : It does n’t seem unrelated to me . If society were gonna VB where we wanted it to VB anyway , which is where we do n’t die from four degrees Celsius of NN , we VBP a mass investment in green jobs . That ’s not just renewable NN jobs , that ’s things IN planting mangrove trees and restoring ecosystems . So if we ’re VBG to put CD trillion dollars in revitalizing the economy , why not create an economy that is more resilient to JJ threats , especially as we ’re facing a JJ threat ? RB , if we had the opportunity to spend trillions of dollars revitalizing the economy and in the process MD not only save millions of lives from NN , but MD save millions of lives from NN NN , creating a better society that ’s more sustainable , why MD n’t we do that ? RF : I VBP for a lot of NNS , we ’re just not VBN to NN telling us things that we can and ca n’t do in this country –closing restaurants , telling NNS to stay home–all these things that a month ago MD have been unthinkable . Do you VB a shift in the NN we VBP NN or the things that become allowable because of this NN ? I mean , if we ’re straight up just giving Americans twelve hundred dollars to just survive and giving industries hundreds of billions of dollars to survive , will a Green JJ Deal , or something IN it , become more politically acceptable ? EA : Americans ’ ability to forget things that have happened and keep up with the status quo is very strong . However , what I MD hope comes out of this situation in terms of changing our NN of thinking is that we understand the difference between sacrifices you make while you still have NN to prevent a problem and sacrifices you make when you were in the thick of a problem . If we ’re VBG to solve NN NN , we will have to make sacrifices . The policies that we put in place now to prevent crises later are VBG to mean that some things are VBG to be weird and uncomfortable and take getting VBN to it . It ’s VBG to radically VB the costs of certain foods , how much we use JJ transportation , how much our taxes are . It ’s VBG to be uncomfortable and it ’s gonna suck , but it ’s RB less uncomfortable than the NNS that NN NN MD force us to make in the moment . I ’ve been covering NN NN for RB enough to VB that if we reach three degrees Celsius , the NN is VBG to look awful . The things that we ’re VBG to have to do to try and reverse that in real - NN are not VBG to be pretty . So let ’s make these sacrifices now so that we all have a better chance of survival when we ’re a little bit down the line ."

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP , Africa is among the most vulnerable continents to NN NN . [ 1] [ 2 ] The vulnerability of Africa to NN NN is driven by a range of factors that includes weak adaptive capacity , high dependence on ecosystem goods for livelihoods , and less developed agricultural production systems . [ 3 ] The risks of NN NN on agricultural production , food security , NN resources and ecosystem services will likely have increasingly severe consequences on lives and sustainable development prospects in Africa . [ 4 ] Managing this NN requires integration of mitigation and NN strategies in the management of ecosystem goods and services , and the agriculture production systems in Africa . [ 5 ] Over the coming decades , NN from NN NN is expected across almost all the NN 's NN , and JJ mean rainfall will increase . [ 6 ] Regional effects on rainfall in the tropics are expected to be much more spatially variable and the sign of NN at any CD location is often less certain , although NNS are expected . Consistent with this , observed NN NNS have generally increased over Africa since the late 19th century to the early 21st century by about 1 °C , but locally as much as 3 °C for minimum NN in the Sahel at the end of the dry season . [ 7 ] Observed precipitation trends indicate spatial and temporal discrepancies as expected . [ 8 ] [ 2 ] The observed NNS in NN and precipitation vary regionally . [ 9 ] [ 8 ] In terms of NN efforts , regional - level actors are making some progress . This includes the development and adoption of several regional NN NN NN strategies [ CD ] e.g. SADC Policy Paper NNP NNP , [ 11 ] and the NN strategy for the NN sector . [ 12 ] In addition , there has been other efforts to enhance NN NN NN , such as the tripatite Programme on NN NN NN and Mitigation in Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA-EAC-SADC ) . [ 13 ] As a supranational organisation of 55 member NNS , the African Union has put forward 47 goals and corresponding actions in a 2014 draft report [ 14 ] to combat and mitigate NN NN on the continent . The Secretary General of the NNP Nations has RB declared a NN for close cooperation with the African Union in order to tackle NN NN , in accordance with the UN 's sustainable development goals . NN NN will increasingly impact Africa due to JJ factors . These impacts are already being felt and will increase in magnitude if NN is not taken to reduce JJ NN NNS . The impacts include higher NNS , drought , changing rainfall patterns and increased NN variability . These conditions have a bearing on NN production and consumption . The recent drought in JJ African NNS , which has been linked to NN NN , adversely affected both NN security and JJ growth across the continent . Agriculture is inherently sensitive to NN conditions and is CD of the most vulnerable sectors to the risks and impacts of JJ NN NN . [ 17 ] Agriculture in most African NNS is mainly JJ - scale and rain - fed , making it particularly vulnerable to NN variability and NN . Observed and projected disruptions in precipitation patterns due to NN NN are likely to shorten growing seasons and affect crop yield in JJ parts of Africa . Furthermore , the agriculture sector in Africa is dominated by smallholder farmers with limited access to technology and the resources to adapt . [ 18 ] NN variability and NN have been and continue to be , the principal source of fluctuations in JJ food production in NNS of the developing NN where production is highly rain - dependent . [ CD ] The agriculture sector is sensitive to NN variability , [ 20 ] especially the inter-annual variability of precipitation , NN patterns , and extreme NN events ( droughts and floods ) . These climatic events are predicted to increase in the future and are expected to have significant consequences to the agriculture sector . [ 21 ] This MD have a negative influence on food prices , food security , and land - use decisions . [ 22 ] Yields from rainfed agriculture in some African NNS MD be reduced by up to 50 % by 2020 . [ 21 ] In order to prevent the future destructive impact of NN variability on food production , it is crucial to adjust or suggest possible policies to cope with increased NN variability . African NNS VBP to build a national legal framework to manage food resources in accordance with the anticipated NN variability . However , before devising a policy to cope with the impacts of NN variability , especially to the agriculture sector , it is critical to have a clear understanding of how NN variability affects JJ food crops . In the NN 2020 , sever invasion of Locusts harmed the agriculture in eastern Africa . The invasion is at least partly due to NN NN - the warmer NN and heavier rainfall caused an abnormal increase in the number of locusts [ 23 ] NN quality and availability have deteriorated in most areas of Africa particularly due to NN NN . Previous research and NN projections provide enough NN that NN resources are vulnerable and have the possibility of being strongly impacted by NN NN with vast ramifications on JJ societies . [ 24 ] The IPCC predicts millions of NNS in Africa will persistently face increased NN stress due to NN variability and NN ( IPCC 2013 ) . NNS in precipitation patterns directly affect NN runoff and NN availability . [ 25 ] Any NNS to the hydrological cycle MD have significant effects on river basins of Africa . To improve understanding of past and future NNS in NN availability due to NN NN , the IPCC ( IPCC 2013 ) recommends VBG the dynamic downscaling technique . The IPCC 2013 proposed VBG the coordinated regional downscaling experiment ( CORDEX ) regional NN models which runs at a maximum of 50 km resolutions , the resolution VBN depends upon the size of the watershed and area coverage by the meteorological records . However , before VBG the NN simulations from the dynamic downscaling , it is appropriate to evaluate their performance at JJ spatial scales since their performance differs from CD location to another and from CD RCM to another . African NNS have the least efficient JJ NN systems in the NN . [ 26 ] Infectious NN burdens such as malaria , schistosomiasis , dengue fever , meningitis , which are sensitive to NN impacts , are highest in the sub-Saharan African region . For instance , over 90 percent of annual JJ malaria NNS are in Africa . [ 26 ] NNS in NN will affect the spread of infectious agents as well as alter NNS ’s disposition to these infections . With increasing population and corresponding NN demand , NN security must be addressed because NN is crucial for sustainable development . NN NN has affected NN sectors in Africa as JJ NNS depend on hydropower generation . Decreasing rainfall levels and droughts have resulted in lower NN levels in dams with adverse impacts on hydropower generation . This has resulted in low electrical NN production , high cost of electricity and NN outages or load - shedding in some African NNS that depend on hydroelectric NN generation . Disruptions in hydropower generation have negatively affected various sectors in NNS such as Ghana , Uganda , Kenya , Tanzania . Central Africa , for the most part , is landlocked and is geographically threatened by NN NN . Due to its high NN variability and rainfed agriculture , Central Africa is expected to experience longer and more frequent heatwaves as well as an increase in wet extremes . [ 27 ] The JJ mean NN in this region is to increase by 1.5 °C to 2 °C . [ 28 ] Angola - "" The objective of the National NNP Programs of NNP are to identify and communicate the urgent and immediate needs of the country regarding NN NN NN , to increase Angola ‘s resilience to NN variabilities and to NN NN to ensure achievement of Poverty reduction programs , sustainable development objectives and the Millennium Development Goals pursued by the NNP . "" [ 29 ] The NN dioxide - absorbing capacity of forests in the Congo Basin have decreased . This decrease has occurred due to increasing heat and drought causing decreased tree growth . This suggests that RB unlogged forests are being affected by NN NN . A Nature NN indicates that by 2030 , the African jungle will absorb 14 percent less NN dioxide than it did from IN 2005 - 2010 , and will absorb none at all by 2035 . [ 30 ] Situated almost entirely in the tropics , rainfall in Eastern Africa is dominated by the seasonal migration of the tropical - rain band . [ 31 ] Eastern Africa is characterized by high spatio - temporal rainfall variability as it spans over 30 degrees of latitude ( across the equator ) . It has influences from both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans , and has major orographic features ( highlands ) as well as inland NN bodies such as Lake Victoria . Therefore the rainfall seasonality varies from a single wet season per NN in July –August in parts of the northwest ( including Ethiopia and South Sudan , which are meteorologically more connected to West Africa , with the West African monsoon bringing the rains ) to a single wet season per NN in December - February in the south ( over Tanzania ) , with JJ areas close to the equator having CD rainy seasons per NN , [ 32 ] approximately in March–May ( the “ NNP Rains ” ) and October to December ( the “ Short Rains ” ) . Fine - scale variability in rainfall seasonality is often linked to orography and lakes . Inter - annual variability can be JJ and VBN controls include variations in NN NN NNS ( SSTs ) of JJ ocean basins , JJ - scale atmospheric modes of variability such as the Madden - Julian Osciliation ( MJO ) [ 33 ] [ 34 ] and tropical cyclones . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Eastern Africa has witnessed frequent and severe droughts in recent decades , as well as devastating floods . Trends in rainfall since the 1980s show a general decrease in March - NNP ( MAM ) seasonal rains with a slight increase during June - September ( JJAS ) and October - December ( OND ) rains , [ 36 ] although there appears to have been a recent recovery in the MAM rains . [ 37 ] In the future , both rainfall and NN are projected to VB over Eastern Africa . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Recent studies on NN projections suggest that average NN might increase by about 2 - 3 °C by the middle of the century and 2 - 5 °C at the end of the century . [ 41 ] This will depend on emission scenarios as well as on how the real NN responds compared with the range of possible outcomes shown by models . NN model projections tend to show an increase in rainfall , particularly during OND season , which is RB projected to occur later . This delay in the short rain season , has been linked to the deepening of the Saharan Heat Low under NN NN . [ 42 ] It should be noted , however that some models predict decreasing rainfall , [ 40 ] [ 41 ] and for some regions and seasons the very largest rainfall increases predicted have been shown to involve implausible mechanisms due to systematic model errors . [ 43 ] In addition , NNS of aerosols provide a forcing of rainfall NN that is not captured in JJ assessments of NN projections . [ 44 ] [ 45 ] The contrast of the drying trend of MAM ( JJ rains ) rainfall in equatorial Eastern Africa , with most models predicting a wetting in the future has been labelled the “ East African NN NN paradox , "" [ 45 ] although there has been some recent recovery in the rainfall . [ 37 ] Studies have shown that the drying trend is unlikely to be purely natural , but MD be driven by factors such as aerosols rather than NN gases , [ 45 ] further research is needed . The drying has been shown to be have been caused by a shorter rainy season , and linked to deepening of the Arabian Heat Low . [ 37 ] Consistent with the uncertainty in rainfall projections , NNS in rainy seasons onset are uncertain in equatorial Eastern Africa , although JJ models predict a later and wetter short rains . [ 42 ] The Indian Ocean Dipole ( IOD ) is VBN to provide a strong NN on inter-annual variability in the short rains , [ 46 ] and studies show that extreme IODs MD increase under NN NN . [ 47 ] Globally , NN NN is expected to lead to intensification of rainfall , as extreme rainfall increases at a faster rate with NN than total rainfall does . [ 6 ] Recent work shows that across Africa JJ models are expected to under -estimate the rate of NN of this rainfall intensification , [ 48 ] and NNS in rainfall extremes MD be much more widespread than those predicted by JJ models . [ 49 ] Southern parts of Eastern Africa receive most of their rainfall in a single rainy season during the southern hemisphere ’s winter : over Tanzania seasonal rainfall is projected to increase under future NN NN , although there is uncertainty . [ 42 ] Further south , over Mozambique , a shorter season due to a later onset is projected under future NN NN , again with some uncertainty . [ 50 ] Comoros - "" NAPA is the operational extension of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper ( PRSP ) , as it includes among its NN priorities , agriculture , fishing , NN , housing , NN , but RB tourism , in an indirect NN , through the reconstitution of basin slopes and the fight against soils erosion , and therefore the protection of reefs by limiting the silting up by terrigenous contributions . [ 51 ] "" Kenya gazetted the NNP NNP Act , CD which establishes an authority to oversee development , management , implementation and regulation of mechanisms to enhance NN NN resilience and low NN development for sustainable development , by the National and County Governments , the private sector , civil society , and other actors . Kenya has RB developed the National NNP NNP NNP Plan ( NCCAP 2018 - 2022 ) which aims to further the country 's development goals by providing mechanisms and measures to achieve low NN NN - resilient development in a manner that prioritizes NN . Madagascar - the priority sectors for NN are : agriculture and livestock , forestry , JJ NN , NN resources and coastal zones . [ 52 ] Malawi - The NAPA identifies the following as high priority activities for NN : "" Improving community resilience to NN NN through the development of sustainable rural livelihoods , Restoring forests in the Upper and Lower Shire Valleys catchments to reduce siltation and associated NN flow problems , Improving agricultural production under erratic rains and changing climatic conditions , Improving Malawi ’s preparedness to cope with droughts and floods , and Improving NN monitoring to enhance Malawi ’s early warning capability and decision making and sustainable utilization of Lake Malawi and lakeshore areas resources [ 53 ] "" . Mauritius - NN should address the following priority areas : coastal resources , agriculture , NN resources , fisheries , NN and well - being , land use NN and forestry and biodiversity .

[ 56 ] The country has RB developed sector VBN policies on NN to NN NN such as the Vision 2020 , the National NNP Policy and the Agricultural Policy among others . [ 57 ] Tanzania Tanzania has outlined priority NN measures in their NAPA , and various national sector strategies and research outputs . [ 58 ] The NAPA has been successful at encouraging NN NN mainstreaming into sector policies in Tanzania ; however , the cross-sectoral collaboration crucial to implementing NN strategies remains limited due to institutional challenges such as NN imbalances , budget constraints and an ingrained sectoral approach . [ 59 ] Most of the projects in Tanzania concern agriculture and NN resource management ( irrigation , NN saving , rainwater collection ) ; however , NN and tourism RB play an important role . [ 60 ] Zambia - "" The NAPA identifies 39 urgent NN needs and CD priority areas within the sectors of agriculture and food security ( livestock , fisheries and crops ) , NN and NN , JJ NN , natural resources and wildlife [ 61 ] "" Zimbabwe - "" The other strategic interventions by the NAP process will be : Strengthening the role of private sector in NN planning , Enhancing of the capacity of NN to develop bankable projects through trainings , Improving management of background NN NN to inform NN NN planning , Crafting a proactive resource - mobilization strategy for identifying and applying for international NN finance as requests for funds are primarily reactive at present , focusing on emergency relief rather than NN NN NN reduction , preparedness and NN , Developing a coordinated monitoring and evaluation policy for programs and projects , as JJ institutions within the NN do not currently have a systematic approach to monitoring and evaluation . [ 62 ] "" Lesotho - "" The key objectives of the NAPA process entail : identification of communities and livelihoods most vulnerable to NN NN , generating a list of activities that MD form a core of the national NN program of NN , and to communicate the country ’s immediate and urgent needs and priorities for building capacity for NN to NN NN [ 63 ] "" Namibia - the critical themes for NN are "" Food security and sustainable biological resource base , Sustainable NN resources base , JJ NN and well being and Infrastructure development [ 64 ] "" South Africa is in the progress of finalizing its national NN NN NN strategy . "" The National NNP strategy acts as a common reference point for NN NN NN efforts in South Africa , and it provides a platform upon which national NN NN NN objectives for the country can be articulated so as to provide overarching guidance to all sectors of the economy [ 65 ] "" The West African region can be divided into four climatic sub-regions namely the Guinea Coast , Soudano - Sahel , Sahel ( extending eastward to the Ethiopian border ) and the Sahara , [ 66 ] each with JJ climatic conditions . The seasonal cycle of rainfall is mainly driven by the south - north movement of the Inter - Tropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) which is characterised by the confluence between moist southwesterly monsoon winds and the dry northeasterly Harmattan . [ 67 ] VBN on the inter -annual rainfall variability , three main climatic periods have been observed over the Sahel : the wet period from 1950 to the early 1960s followed by a dry period from 1972 to 1990 and then the period from 1991 onwards which has seen a partial rainfall recovery . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] During the dry period , the Sahel experienced a number of particularly severe drought events , with devastating effects . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] The recent decades , have RB witnessed a moderate increment in annual rainfall since the beginning of 1990s . However , total annual rainfall remains significantly below that observed during the 1950s . [ 73 ] [ 71 ] Some have identified the recent 2 decades as a recovery period . [ 74 ] Others refer to this as a period of ‘ hydrological intensification ’ with much of the annual rainfall increase coming from more severe rain events and sometimes flooding rather than more frequent rainfall , or similarly other works [ 75 ] [ 76 ] underline the continuity of the drought RB though the rainfall has increased . Since 1985 , 54 percent of the population has been affected by five or more floods in the 17 Sahel region NNS . [ 77 ] In 2012 , severe drought conditions in the Sahel were reported . Governments in the region responded quickly , launching strategies to address the issue . [ 78 ] The region is projected to experience NNS in rainfall regime , with NN models suggesting that decreases in wet season rainfall are more likely in the western Sahel , and increases more likely in the central to east Sahel , although opposite trends can not yet be ruled out . [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] These trends will affect the frequency and severity of floods , droughts , desertification , sand and dust storms , desert locust plagues and NN shortages . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] However , irrespective of the NNS in seasonal mean rain , the most intense storms are expected to become more intense , amplifying flood frequency . [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Enhanced NN NNS and JJ NN MD RB lead to an increase in dry spells especially across the Guinea Coast associated with a reduction of the wet spells under both 1.5 ℃ and 2 ℃ JJ NN level . [ 86 ] Fifteen percent of Sahel region population has RB experienced a NN increase of more than 1 °C from 1970 to 2010 . The Sahel region , in particular , will experience higher average NNS over the course of the 21st century and NNS in rainfall patterns , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) . NN NN , and resulting in increased NNS , storms , droughts , and rising NN levels , will affect the incidence and distribution of infectious NN across the globe . [ 87 ] This is JJ in Africa , where malaria continues to have dramatic effects on the population . As NN NN continues , the specific areas likely to experience the NN - round , high - NN transmission of malaria will shift from coastal West Africa to an area between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda , VBN as the African Highlands . [ 88 ] To understand the exposures that affect shifting malaria transmission rates we can look to The Epidemiologic Triad , a model that explains the relationship between exposure , transmission , and causation of infectious diseases . [ 89 ] With regards to malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands , factors and exposures resulting from drastic JJ NNS IN warmer climates , shifts in NN patterns , and increases in JJ impact such as deforestation , provide appropriate conditions for malaria transmission between carrier and host . [ 90 ] Because of this , vectors will adapt , thrive , and multiply at a fast pace . An increase in the number of vectors that carry parasites , microbes , and pathogens that VBP NN will become a NN hazard for the JJ population . [ 87 ] Specifically , malaria is caused by the Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasites which are carried by the vector Anopheles mosquito . RB though the Plasmodium vivax parasite can survive in lower NNS , the Plasmodium falciparum parasite will only survive and replicate in the mosquito when NN NNS are above 20 ℃ . [ 91 ] Increases in humidity and rain RB contribute to the replication and survival of this infectious agent . , [ 92 ] Increasing JJ NNS combined with NNS in land cover as a result of extreme deforestation will create ideal habitats for mosquitoes to survive in the African Highlands . If deforestation continues at its current rate , more land will be available for mosquito breeding grounds , and the population of mosquitos will rapidly increase . The increase in mosquitoes will thus increase the opportunity for both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasites to proliferate . Exposure to malaria will become a greater NN to NNS as the number of female Anopheles mosquitos infected with either the Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax parasite increases . [ 92 ] The mosquito will transmit the parasite to the JJ host through a bite , resulting in infection . Then , when an uninfected mosquito bites the now infected JJ host , the parasite will be transmitted to the mosquitoes which will then become an exposure to other uninfected JJ hosts . Individuals who are constantly exposed to the Malaria parasite due to multiple bites by mosquitoes that carry the parasite are at greater NN of dying . [ 91 ] Infected NNS can RB transmit the NN to uninfected or healthy NNS via contaminated NN . [ 91 ] The NN effects caused by shifts in malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands have the potential to be severe . Research has shown that the effects of NN NN on NN will impact most populations over the next few decades . [ 93 ] However , Africa , and specifically the African Highlands , are susceptible to being particularly negatively affected . In 2010 , 91 % of the JJ burden due to malaria deaths occurred in Africa . Several spatiotemporal models have been studied to assess the potential effect of projected NN scenarios on malaria transmission in Africa . A NN conducted by Caminade FW FW . [ 94 ] concluded that the most significant NN NN effects are confined to specific regions , including the African Highlands . These results are consistent with previous studies . Ultimately , studies show an overall increase in NN suitability for malaria transmission resulting in an increase in the population at NN of contracting the NN . [ 94 ] Of significant importance is the increase of epidemic potential at higher altitudes ( IN the African Highlands ) . Rising NNS in these areas have the potential to VB normally non-malarial areas to areas with seasonal epidemics . [ 95 ] Consequently , JJ populations will be exposed to the NN resulting in healthy NNS lost . In addition , the NN burden MD be more detrimental to areas that lack the ability and resources to effectively respond to such challenges and stresses . [ 96 ] Scientific limitations when examining shifting malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands are similar to those related to broader understandings of NN NN and malaria . While modeling with NN NNS shows that there is a relationship between an increase in NN and an increase in malaria transmission , limitations still exist . Future population shifts that affect population density , as well as NNS in the behavior of mosquitos , can affect transmission rates and are limiting factors in determining the future NN of malaria outbreaks , which RB affect planning for correct outbreak response preparation . [ 88 ] The challenges of controlling and possibly eradicating malaria in the African Highlands are JJ and varied . JJ of the strategies VBN to VB malaria have not changed , are few in number and have rarely been added to in the last 20 NNS . The most common forms of NN are educating the NN and vector NN . The huge geographic area of the vectors Anopheles is possibly the largest challenge faced in the NN of malaria . With such a JJ area to cover it is hard to use insecticides at a continuous and effective level . [ 97 ] This form of NN is expensive , and the areas affected are not able to sustain NN . Without sustained NN , a rapid resurgence in parasite transmission is seen . Another challenge with insecticides is that the vector is now becoming insecticide - resistant . Due to the fact that mosquitoes have several generations per NN , resistance is seen very quickly . [ 97 ] Education has its limitations as well , as the population most affected by malaria are NNS , and the educational message is to stay inside during peak mosquito activity . The low socioeconomic status of the NNS who inhabit the African Highlands is RB a challenge . Local NN facilities have limited resources , and poor living conditions and malnourishment exacerbate malaria NNS and increase the likelihood of death due to malaria . [ 97 ] As NN NN shifts geographic areas of transmission to the African Highlands , the challenge will be to find and VB the vector in areas that have not seen it before , and to not waste resources on areas where the NN is no longer conducive to parasite growth . [ 98 ] The solutions that can VB malaria VB and possibly lead to eradication are far fewer in number than the challenges , but if they are effective they can truly VB the areas currently affected . There are number of groups working on a NN , some are looking to VB the transmission of the parasite to the host , or VB transmission from JJ back to the vector . [ 99 ] These NNS are not very effective currently , and lose their effectiveness over NN , so are not ideal . But , the development is still progressing in the hopes of finding a better , more effective JJ - lasting NN . [ 99 ] An alternative to NNS is vectored immunoprophylaxis ( VIP ) that is a form a gene therapy . This therapy will VB cells in the host that will secrete antigens from various stages of the parasite in the hopes of triggering an anamnestic JJ response in the recipient and prevent NN and parasite transmission . [ 100 ] The policy implications of NN NN and malaria rates in the African Highlands are RB vast , and ultimately fall into CD categories : • Enacting policy that will reduce NN gas NNS , thus slowing down NN NN , and • Mitigating problems that have already arisen , and will inevitably continue to develop , due to NN NN . [ 101 ] Addressing both of these areas is of great importance , as those in the poorest NNS , including NNS that make up the African Highlands , face the greatest burden . Additionally , when NNS are forced to contend with a NN IN malaria , their prospects for JJ growth are slowed . This contributes to continued and worsening JJ inequality . [ 102 ] When addressing policy that will reduce NN gas NNS , it is necessary to act on a JJ scale , RB when related effects are narrowed to a smaller area . The 2015 Lancet Commission on NNP and NNP NNP made nine recommendations for governments to address . These include : • Support cities that encourage healthy activities for individuals and the NN . • Increase access to renewable NN in low to middle - income NNS . • Quantify avoided burdens when these measures are taken . • Create an agreement that will VB counties making NNS to become low - NN economies . [ 101 ] When PRP focuses on mitigation , specifically as it relates to malaria in the African Highlands , research is still an important component . This research needs to take JJ forms , including attribution studies , to VB clarify the degree to which malaria rates are attributed to NN NN ; scenario modeling , which can VB further our understanding of future NN NN consequences on malaria rates ; and examinations of intervention programs and techniques , to VB our understanding of what appropriate responses are . [ 102 ] Surveillance and monitoring of malaria in populations in the African Highlands will RB be important , to better understand NN . [ 101 ] Beyond these research priorities , it is RB important that we enact policies that will significantly increase investments in JJ NN in the African Highlands . This achieves CD goals , the JJ being better outcomes related to malaria in the affected area , and the second being an overall better NN environment for populations .

Watch the JJ NN below . Foals have been very open about their passion for campaigning against NN NN . At the Mercury Prize ceremony in September , they held up the Music Declares Emergency banner , which reads : “ No music on a dead NN . ” Talking to NME about the gesture in a recent NNP Read interview , singer Yannis Philippakis VBD : “ Fay Milton ( of Savages ) is an old friend and great drummer . I was talking to her about Extinction Rebellion then we signed up to Music Declares Emergency . “ We ’d been NN offsetting before that and we ’d been aware of JJ problems . It ’s definitely disturbed me for a while , that ’s why a lot of the lyrics on these CD records pertain to that . ” He continued : “ On the day of the Mercury Prize , we thought it MD be good to bring exposure to Music Declares and just to VB that sentiment across . It ’s easy to VB , ‘ Oh , everyone knows what ’s VBG on with the environment and everyone ’s making NNS ’ , but it ’s CD of those echo chamber things where you forget that actually lots of NNS either do n’t care , do n’t VB it or do n’t act upon it . ” NME recently spoke to Fay Milton about the organisation and what the music industry can do to combat NN NN . “ There ’s such a short period of NN to make the NNS we VBP to make , and to make NNS wake up and realise that there is n’t NN for everyone to VB everything they do , ” she VBD . “ To use Greta Thunberg ’s analogy , the NN is on fire , and there is n’t NN for whoever started the fire with their cigarette to quit smoking before saying the NN is on fire – it ’s on fire now , and we VBP to fix this . Let ’s VB our lifestyles , let ’s fly less , let ’s use less plastic – but ultimately what ’s needed is a governmental response . ” Foals RB released a JJ live film called Rip Up The Road . In an NME review of the film , James McMahon VBD : “ Rip Up The Road is a film where we VBP the opportunity to understand Foals in a NN we ’ve never done before . “ Simultaneously it gives the band a canvas to do the same about themselves . It is a film that asks why we love music and why music is made and shows us the men behind the melodies . ”"

However , there are still JJ gaps in understanding and characterising NN impacts in Europe and how impacts in the rest of the NN MD affect Europe . This report provides quantitative modelling - VBN results from biophysical and agro-economic models as part of the PESETA - IV ( Projection of JJ impacts of NN NN in Sectors of the European Union VBN on bottom - up Analysis ) project . We analyse NN NN projections for 2050 considering the Representative Concentration Pathway ( RCP ) of 8.5 W/m2 ( with corresponding JJ NN levels ranging between 1.6 oC and 2.7 oC compared to pre-industrial levels ) , as well as for 1.5 °C and 2 °C NN conditions . Results show that NN NN will pose a threat to JJ food production in the medium to JJ term , and that Europe will RB be affected . Forced by the projected NNS in daily NN , precipitation , wind , relative humidity , and JJ radiation , grain maize yields in the EU will decline between 1 % and 22 % . In addition , wheat yields in Southern Europe are expected to decrease by up to 49 % . However , in Northern Europe some of the negative productivity effects caused by NN NN MD be partially offset by higher levels of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and changing precipitation regimes . Losses , especially in Southern Europe MD be reduced by tailored NN strategies ; e.g. changing varieties and crop types , increasing and improving irrigation practices for certain crops and when economically feasible . However , limitations on sustainable NN abstraction levels MD become a barrier to increase irrigation levels , specifically in the Mediterranean NNS ( particularly Spain , Portugal , Greece , Cyprus , Malta , Italy and Turkey ) where duration of NN scarcity under JJ NN are projected to intensify . As JJ negative NN NN impacts on productivity outside of the EU are estimated , JJ NN spill - over effects will push up production in both Northern and Southern Europe through higher demand for some agricultural commodities outside of EU , resulting in higher producer prices . This , in turn , MD benefit farmers ' income and have positive effects on the EU ’s agricultural commodity exports . However , other limiting factors ( not all fully integrated into the VBN modelling NN yet ) , such as increasing NN shortage in Southern Europe ( Task CD ) and constraints on the expansion of irrigation , increasing impacts of heatwaves and droughts , consequences of reduction of nutrient use due to JJ and NN mitigation constraints , VBP to be further evaluated ."

Writing at the Australian site Quadrant , Tony Thomas introduces the English - speaking NN to the truth - telling of Dr. Mototaka Nakamura ( hat tip : Andrew Bolt , John McMahon ) . There ’s a top - level oceanographer and meteorologist who is prepared to cry “ Nonsense ! ” on the “ JJ NN NN ” evident to NN modellers but not in the real NN . He ’s as well or better qualified than the modellers he criticises — the ones whose NN 2100 forebodings of 4degC NN have set the NN to spending $ US1.5 trillion a NN to combat CO2 NNS . The iconoclast is Dr. Mototaka Nakamura . In June he put out a JJ book in Japanese on “ the sorry NN of NN NN ” . It ’s titled Confessions of a NN scientist : the JJ NN hypothesis is an unproven hypothesis , and he is very much qualified to take a stand . From 1990 to 2014 he worked on cloud dynamics and forces mixing atmospheric and ocean flows on medium to planetary scales . His bases were MIT ( for a NNP of NNP in meteorology ) , Georgia Institute of Technology , Goddard NNP Flight Centre , Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Duke and Hawaii Universities and the Japan Agency for Marine - NNP NNP and Technology . He ’s published about 20 NN papers on fluid dynamics . [ i ] Today ’s vast panoply of “ JJ NN NN ” is IN an upside down pyramid built on the work of a few score of serious NN modellers . They claim to have demonstrated JJ - derived CO2 NNS as the NN of recent JJ NN and project that NN forward . Every orthodox NN researcher takes such output from the modellers ’ black boxes as a given . Dr. Nakamura has just made his work available to the English - speaking NN : And the critique he offers is comprehensive . Now Nakamura has VBN it again , further accusing the orthodox NNS of “ NN falsification ” by adjusting previous NN NNS to increase apparent NN “ The JJ NN mean NN - NN NNS no longer have any scientific value and are nothing except a propaganda tool to the NN , ” he writes . The NN models are useful tools for academic studies , he VBZ . However , “ the models just become useless pieces of junk or worse ( worse in a sense that they can produce gravely misleading output ) when they are VBN for NN forecasting . ” The reason : These models completely lack some critically important NN processes and feedbacks , and represent some other critically important NN processes and feedbacks in grossly distorted manners to the extent that makes these models totally useless for any meaningful NN prediction . I myself VBD to use NN simulation models for scientific studies , not for predictions , and learned about their problems and limitations in the process . NN forecasting is simply impossible , if only because future NNS in solar NN output are unknowable . As to the impacts of JJ - caused CO2 , they ca n’t be judged “ with the NN and technology we currently possess . ” # A complete lack of meaningful representations of aerosol NNS that generate clouds . # Lack of understanding of drivers of NN - albedo ( reflectivity ) feedbacks : “ Without a reasonably accurate representation , it is impossible to make any meaningful predictions of NN variations and NNS in the middle and high latitudes and thus the entire NN . ” # Arbitrary “ tunings ” ( fudges ) of key parameters that are not understood Concerning CO2 NNS he VBZ , I VBP to point out a simple fact that it is impossible to correctly predict RB the sense or direction of a NN of a NN when the prediction tool lacks and / or grossly distorts important non-linear processes , feedbacks in particular , that are present in the actual NN … … The real or realistically - simulated NN NN is far more complex than an absurdly simple NN simulated by the toys that have been VBN for NN predictions to date , and will be insurmountably difficult for those naïve NN researchers who have zero or very limited understanding of geophysical fluid dynamics . I understand geophysical fluid dynamics just a little , but enough to realize that the dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans are absolutely critical facets of the NN NN if PRP hopes to ever make any meaningful prediction of NN variation . Solar input , absurdly , is modelled as a “ never changing quantity ” . He VBZ , “ It has only been several decades since we acquired an ability to accurately monitor the incoming solar NN . In these several decades only , it has varied by CD to CD watts per square metre . Is it reasonable to assume that it will not vary any more than that in the next hundred NNS or longer for forecasting purposes ? I MD VB , No . ” There is much , much more . Read the whole thing . But who are you VBG to VB : a superbly qualified Japanese scientist or a Swedish teenager with mental issues ?"

In addition to his granddaughter Hannah , he is survived by his wife ; CD NNS from his JJ marriage , Peter Houghton and Janet Malcolm ; a younger brother , Paul ; and six other grandchildren . An older brother , David , died in 2015 . In recent NNS Dr. Houghton had retired to the Welsh seaside and was fading into dementia , Hannah Malcolm VBD , adding : “ But the NN remained with him . A good NN . ” As a leader of the I.P.C.C. , he had the skills of a statesman , VBD Jean - Pascal van Ypersele of the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium . He recalled watching Dr. Houghton co-chair a meeting in 1995 in Madrid that led to a statement that the smoking gun of NN NN had been VBN : The influence of JJ activities on NN was becoming discernible in observations of the present , not just in projections of the future . “ Fossil fuel NNS and oil - dependent NNS were intensely lobbying at that I.P.C.C. meeting to try to dilute the message , ” Dr. van Ypersele VBD . But Dr. Houghton , he added , “ had a deep understanding of the NN , ” and “ he was RB a British gentleman , able to listen patiently to the views of vested interests , and manage the meeting so that NNS MD have the last word , as it should be . ” After a marathon session that was still VBG at 4 a.m. , the tough language was approved . Despite such efforts , however , effective JJ NN to blunt the effects of a NN NN has yet to happen . In a series of NNP messages about her grandfather , Ms. Malcolm VBD : “ When I was younger , my consistent memory of him was warnings over the devastation waiting us if we did n’t act on NN NN .

As astonishing as it MD sound , we are witnessing a full - blown disinformation / re-education campaign against the NNS of the NNP NNPS . They are being taught that chemical aerosols ( geoengineering / "" chemtrails "" ) being sprayed from jets are "" harmless NN vapor "" . RB , it clearly demonstrates that the NN fully intends to continue spraying for a JJ NN . They are conditioning your NNS to VB that these chemical / metallic aerosols are "" harmless "" so they wo n't protest , resist , or otherwise oppose the spraying when they grow up . Second , a disinformation campaign of this scale reveals the alarming reality that we are witnessing the implementation of a plan that was set in motion NNS ago . This plan — to kill off a significant portion of the population — is being sold to the NN as being for "" the greater good of mankind "" . "" Eugenic goals are most likely to be attained under another name than eugenics . "" — Frederick Henry Osborn , 1937 ; Popular eugenicist , founding member of the NNP Eugenics Society , selected by Franklin Roosevelt to chair the Civilian Advisory Committee on Selective Service in 1940 . Why are NNP 's NNS being taught lies which VBP them to accept the systematic poisoning of all NN in NNP ? Is it because powerful proponents of JJ depopulation serve in the most powerful JJ positions in the NN ? Have n't we seen this before ? Do we RB VB to VB it again ? How these questions are answered is entirely up to you . This textbook is being VBN to teach NNS that chemical aerosols are harmless NN vapor "" condensation trails "" , but this is blatantly JJ . Jet engines do not produce condensation trails except under extremely rare conditions , and these will be too short and too high to be seen from the group . In fact , most NNS will never VB a JJ condensation trail in their entire lives . JJ skywatchers and airline pilots have come forward to express their disdain about the blatant disinformation being VBN to the NN regarding contrail formation . Below is an excerpt from the school textbook entitled "" NNP Studies "" . We have provided photos and a transcript of chapter 7 which is entitled "" Clouds , Prescription , and NNP Radar "" . A familiar sight in the daytime sky almost anywhere is contrails , bright white streamers of NN crystals that form in the exhaust of jet aircraft ( Figure 7.1 ) . Contrails are modifying the cloud cover along heavily traveled air corridors between major urban areas with possible implications for NN and NN . According to some studies , contrails already cover about 5 % of the sky in some portions of the eastern NNP NNPS . A contrail , short for condensation trail , develops when the hot humid air in jet engine exhaust mixes with the cold , drier air at high altitudes . Turbulence in the exhaust causes the mixing . A similar process enables us to “ VB our breath ” when we exhale on a cold winter day . For details on this process , VB this chapter ’s JJ Essay , “ Clouds by Mixing . ” Depending on atmospheric conditions , contrails MD dissipate ( sublimate ) within minutes or hours , or they MD spread laterally forming wispy cirrus clouds that persist for a day or so . Atmospheric NNS hypothesized that increased cloud cover caused by contrails MD effect the local radiation budget in CD ways : During daylight hours , contrails and their cirrus byproducts incoming solar radiation thereby cooling NNP ’s NN . At night , contrails and associated cirrus clouds absorb and emit infrared radiation welling up from below thereby enhancing the NN effect and elevating NNP ’s NN NN . Cooler days and warmer nights reduces the diurnal NN range ( DTR ) , the difference between the day ’s maximum and minimum NNS . Furthermore , contrails MD stimulate precipitation locally by supplying NN crystal nuclei for lower clouds . NNS had an opportunity to test their hypothesis regarding the impact of contrails on the radiation budget immediately after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 when the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) ordered a three - day shutdown of all commercial air traffic in the NNP NNPS . Almost immediately , contrails began to dissipate . David J. Travis , a NN scientist at the NNP of Wisconsin - Whitewater , and colleagues at Pennsylvania NNP NNP analyzed the effects of a contrail - free sky on NN NNS at 4,000 U.S. NN stations . They VBD that the DTR during the three - day period was about 1.1 - Celsius degree ( 2 Fahrenheit degrees ) higher than the JJ - term ( 30 - NN ) average . Furthermore , the DTR for the three - day periods preceding and following the shutdown was below the JJ - term average . These observations support the hypothesis that contrails MD contribute to NN NN by making days colder and nights warmer . With the expected future increase in JJ aircraft traffic , some NNS expect the contribution of contrails to NN NN to become more significant ; the average contrail sky coverage expected to more than double by 2050 . At this point , it is not VBN whether more contrails will have a net NN or cooling effect on JJ NN . Driving Question : How do clouds and precipitation form ! Clouds whisk across the sky in ever - changing patterns of white and gray ; fog lends an eerie silence to a dreary day . Clouds and fog are NNS of condensation or deposition of NN vapor within the atmosphere . Most clouds are the consequence of saturation brought about by uplift and expansional cooling of air . Fog is a cloud that forms near , or in contact , with NNP ’s NN ; most fogs develop when the lowest layer of air is chilled to saturation via radiational or advective cooling . Cloud formation is an essential part of the JJ NN cycle because without clouds there MD be no rain or snow . And yet most clouds — RB those associated with JJ storm systems — do not produce precipitation . The principal subjects of this chapter are the development and classification of clouds and fog , plus the formation and types of precipitation . We RB examine NN radar , a valuable tool for locating and tracking areas of precipitation and for monitoring air motion within NN systems . This chapter closes with a summary of the various direct and remote methods for measuring precipitation . NN vapor is an invisible component of air , but its condensation and deposition NNS ( NN droplets and NN crystals ) are visible . A cloud is the visible product of condensation or deposition of NN vapor within the atmosphere ; it consists of an aggregate of minute NN droplets and / or NN crystals suspended in the atmosphere . This section covers the process of cloud development . Clouds are increasingly likely to form as air nears saturation . But when NNS try to simulate this process in the laboratory VBG a clean - air chamber , a cloud does not form RB if the relative humidity is elevated well above 100 % , that is , to supersaturation values . A clean - air chamber is an enclosed container of air from which all solid and liquid particles ( aerosols ) have been filtered out . Introducing NN vapor into the chamber raises the relative humidity , but RB if the relative humidity is elevated to as high as 200 % , no cloud forms . How is that possible ? We expect that once air becomes saturated ( relative to a JJ - NN NN ) , condensation MD initially produce extremely JJ droplets and those droplets MD eventually grow into cloud droplets through additional condensation . However , droplets will not form in the JJ place unless the relative humidity rises to extraordinarily high levels of supersaturation . Tiny droplets cannot form in a cloud chamber without a supersaturated environment because of the so - called curvature effect . The curvature of a NN NN affects the ability of NN molecules to escape ( vaporize ) from the NN NN . The smaller the droplet , the greater is the concentration of surrounding NN vapor that is necessary for the droplet to grow . The curvature of the NN of a spherical NN droplet increases as the radius of the droplet decreases ; that is , the NN of a JJ droplet has a greater curvature than the NN of a JJ droplet . ( At the limit , a JJ - NN NN has no curvature . ) With increasing curvature , molecules that form the NN of a droplet have fewer neighboring molecules and are more weakly bonded . Molecules composing a JJ - NN NN have the most neighboring molecules and are most strongly bonded . Bond strength affects the flux of NN molecules from the liquid to vapor phase . For this reason , NN molecules more readily escape a NN droplet than a JJ - NN NN and NN molecules more readily escape a JJ NN droplet than a JJ NN droplet . Consequently , at the same NN , the saturation vapor pressure surrounding a JJ NN droplet is greater than that surrounding a JJ droplet . Values of saturation vapor pressure listed in Table 6.3 are defined for air over a JJ NN of fresh NN and are the basis for computing relative humidity ( Chapter 6 ) . The saturation vapor pressure increases with increasing curvature ( and decreasing droplet size ) . For droplets having a radius of 0.001 micrometer , the saturation vapor pressure at a given NN is about 3.4 times that specified in Table 6.3 , which computes to a relative humidity of 340 % . On the other hand , for droplets having a radius greater than 1.0 micrometer , the difference between the saturation vapor pressure surrounding the droplet and the values listed in Table 6.3 is minimal and computes to a relative humidity only slightly higher than 100 % . The bottom line : In clean air , NN vapor will not condense into tiny NN droplets unless the air is supersaturated to very high levels . In the real atmosphere , the relative humidity never RB approaches such great supersaturation values , so tiny droplets cannot form or grow . What then makes cloud formation possible ? The clean - air chamber experiment described above failed to produce a cloud because the air was not sufficiently supersaturated . In the real atmosphere , supersaturated air is not needed for clouds to develop ; in fact , cloud droplets readily form as the relative humidity nears 100 % . And clouds are abundant ; at any given NN , about 60 % of the NN is shrouded in clouds . How then , do cloud droplets form ? The answer : they have a head start . Suspended in air are solid and liquid particles that provide relatively JJ NN areas on which condensation or deposition initially takes place . These naturally occurring particles that promote condensation or deposition in the atmosphere are VBN as nuclei . Nuclei have radii greater than 1.0 micrometer and favor condensation ( or deposition ) of NN vapor . Once condensation ( or deposition ) starts , they become comparably sized cloud droplets ( or NN crystals ) . Additional growth of these droplets ( or NN crystals ) by condensation ( or deposition ) is more likely because they can grow in an environment with a relative humidity that exceeds 100 % by only 1 % or so . Most cloud particles have radii of 2 to CD micrometers . ­­ Nuclei , essential for cloud formation , are abundant in the atmosphere and are continually cycled into the atmosphere from NNP ’s NN . Sources of nuclei include volcanic eruptions , wind erosion of soil , forest fires , and ocean spray . When NN waves break , drops of salt NN enter the atmosphere and the NN evaporates leaving behind tiny sea-salt crystals that function as nuclei ( Figure 7.2 ) . NNS from domestic and industrial chimneys RB contribute nuclei to the atmosphere . Depending on the product ( liquid NN droplets or NN crystals ) , a distinction is made between cloud condensation nuclei and NN - forming nuclei . Cloud condensation nuclei ( CCN ) promote condensation of NN vapor at NNS both above and below the freezing point of NN . Within the atmosphere , NN vapor can condense into cloud droplets that remain liquid RB at NNS well below 00 C ( 320 F ) . Droplets at such NNS are described as supercooled . NN - forming nuclei ( IN ) are much less common than CCNs and promote formation of NN crystals only at NNS well below freezing . The most efficient NN - forming nuclei are substances having a crystal structure similar to that of NN and most are almost insoluble in NN . Clayey soil particles are excellent NN - forming nuclei . The CD types of NN - forming nuclei are freezing nuclei and deposition nuclei . Freezing nuclei are particles on which NN vapor condenses and subsequently freezes ; they are active at NNS below about - 90 C ( 160 F ) . Hygroscopic nuclei are a special category of cloud condensation nuclei because they possess a chemical attraction for NN molecules . Condensation begins on hygroscopic nuclei at a relative humidity under 100 % . Magnesium chloride ( MgCl2 ) , a salt in sea-spray , can promote condensation at a relative humidity as low as 70 % ! Clouds form more efficiently where hygroscopic nuclei are abundant . JJ sources of hygroscopic nuclei exist in urban - industrial areas and this helps explain why localities downwind of JJ cities tend to be somewhat cloudier and rainier than upwind localities . The Metropolitan Meteorological Experiment ( METROMEX ) conducted in the 1970s demonstrated that the average summer rainfall was 5 % to 25 % greater within , and up to 50 to 75 km ( 31 to 47 mi ) downwind of St. Louis , MO than upwind of the city . In more recent NNS , similar urban effects on precipitation were detected in Tokyo , Phoenix , and other cities . Besides being a source of hygroscopic nuclei , cities RB spur cloud and precipitation development by contributing NN vapor ( raising the relative humidity ) and heat ( adding to the buoyancy of air ) . Furthermore , the relative roughness of a city NN induces convergence of horizontal winds , uplift of air , and expansional cooling ( Chapter 8 ) . Interestingly , not all NN crystals form on the traditional nuclei described above . While sampling NN crystals in cold clouds from aircraft , NNS discovered that the concentration of NN crystals is highly variable within the cloud and NN crystals are CD to 1,000 times more numerous than nuclei . This discrepancy is likely explained by the presence of fragments of NN crystals that break off during midair collisions . These NN fragments then function as additional nuclei .

Well , if an article by Jason Hickel in Foreign Policy , with the sub - title “ If the NN is n’t careful , renewable NN MD become as destructive as fossil fuels . ” is anything to VB by there is very real reasons to be concerned ! Here is the opening few paragraphs from the article : The conversation about NN NN has been blazing ahead in recent months . Propelled by the school NN strikes and JJ movements IN Extinction Rebellion , a number of governments have declared a NN emergency , and progressive JJ parties are making plans — at last — for a rapid transition to clean NN under the banner of the Green NNP Deal . This is a welcome shift , and we VBP more of it . But a JJ problem is beginning to emerge that warrants our attention . Some proponents of the Green NNP Deal seem to VB that it will pave the NN to a utopia of “ green growth . ” Once we trade dirty fossil fuels for clean NN , there ’s no reason we can’t keep expanding the economy forever . This narrative MD seem reasonable enough at JJ glance , but there are good reasons to VB twice about it . CD of them has to do with clean NN itself . The phrase “ clean NN ” normally conjures up happy , innocent images of warm sunshine and fresh wind . But while sunshine and wind is obviously clean , the infrastructure we VBP to capture it is not . Far from it . The transition to renewables is VBG to require a dramatic increase in the extraction of metals and rare - NN minerals , with real ecological and JJ costs . In 2017 , the NNP Bank released a little - noticed report that offered the JJ comprehensive look at this question . It models the increase in material extraction that MD be required to build enough solar and wind utilities to produce an annual output of about 7 terawatts of electricity by 2050 . That ’s enough to VB roughly half of the JJ economy . By doubling the NNP Bank figures , we can estimate what it will take to VB all the NN to zero NNS — and the results are staggering : 34 CD metric tons of copper , 40 CD tons of lead , 50 CD tons of zinc , 162 CD tons of aluminum , and no less than 4.8 CD tons of iron . So the question is this , are we RB moving to cleaner and greener forms of NN sources , or are we merely creating JJ problems to remove another ? Material extraction is a costly business , both financially and more importantly environmentally . With the staggering amount of material resources required to replace fossil fuels with renewable NN sources its easy to VB why JJ are so skeptical . • JJ Distancing Was Created by the NNP as a Torture Technique • UK Begins to Reopen Its Newly Created Dystopian Society to The NN • VB Hello to The Next Possible NN • Biofields – Our Ability to Thrive & Prosper is Under Attack"

In fact , it was hot all across Europe that NN . In the Alps , glaciers melted , their snouts retreating up steep - sided valleys . Fires burned from France to Poland . And in the wine country of central France , the grapes withered to raisins on the vine , so the wine made from them was syrupy and extra-alcoholic . Normally , winemakers harvested grapes at the very end of September or early October . But that NN , they had to scurry to VB overripe grapes off the vine weeks earlier than usual . Now , a nearly 700 - NN - JJ record of harvest dates from the town of Beaune , in Burgundy , shows that early harvest dates IN the NN from 1540 are now par for the course , thanks to NN NN . NNS and historians stitched together a record of grape harvest dates VBG back to 1354 . They VBD that air NNS have warmed so much — and especially in the last 30 NNS — that grapes are now harvested almost CD weeks before their historical norm . “ We can clearly VB the reaction of the grapes to the rise in NN , ” VBZ Thomas Labbé , an historian at the NNP of Leipzig . And that reaction is changing the wine itself . Wine , in Burgundy , is built into the fabric of the culture . The pinot noir and chardonnay grapes the region is VBN for have been growing there and adapting to the precise NN conditions of the region for centuries . Winemakers VBP the growth stages intimately : the look of the vines before they bud ; the look of the vines as they mature over JJ seasons ; and the fat , sugary , fragrant curve of the grapes when they ’re ready to be made into wine . That harvest point is crucial . Too RB on the vine and the grapes have too much sugar in them , meaning the wine will be more alcoholic — not the subtle feel most winemakers in the region care for . Too RB , and the acids that give wine some of its feel in the mouth MD disintegrate . Not RB enough , and they might not have developed the JJ balance of fragrant chemicals that give the wine its characteristic flavours . Winemakers keep careful track of harvest dates , with some records stretching back to the Middle Ages . In the 1800s , NNS and historians realised that those careful records MD be VBN to keep track of how the NN in JJ parts of Europe has changed over NN . “ Grape harvest date records are the longest records of phonology in Europe , ” VBZ Elizabeth Wolkovich , a biologist at the NNP of British Columbia who studies wine and NN relationships . “ We have these hundreds of NNS of records of what the summer temp was JJ , and we can use them IN a thermometer . ” Grape harvest dates reflect the NN the grapes have felt over the course of the growing season , from about April until they ’re picked . If the spring and summer are hot , the grapes mature faster and VBP to be picked sooner . If they 're cool , the opposite is JJ . NN historians started to pull together ancient NN from other sources , too . They matched up the patterns in the grape harvest NNS with records made from tree rings and the length of glaciers in the Alps . They VBD records IN those to figure out that much of central Europe warmed up during the Medieval Warm Period , from IN 900 to 1300 . It had cooled down during the Little NNP Age , from about the 15th to the 19th centuries . The historians saw that over the past few hundred NNS , NNS wobbled RB , skewing warm for short stretches and cooling down in others . But overall , NN rocked up and down IN a fairly consistent average value — until recently ."

""_''","( CNN ) The NNP is heading toward a "" JJ tipping point "" if the NN NN continues on its current path , NNS have warned , as they called for urgent NN to avoid "" an existential threat to civilization . "" The group of researchers , who published a commentary in the journal Nature , VBP there is growing NN to suggest that irreversible NNS to the NNP 's JJ systems are already taking place , and that we are now in a "" NN of planetary emergency . "" A JJ tipping point is a threshold when the NN 's systems VBP beyond the point of no return -- such as the loss of the Amazon rainforest , accelerated melting of NN sheets , and thawing of permafrost -- the authors of the commentary VBP . Such a collapse MD lead to "" hothouse "" conditions that MD make some areas on NNP uninhabitable . "" We argue that the intervention NN left to prevent tipping MD already have shrunk towards zero , whereas the reaction NN to achieve net zero NNS is 30 NNS at best , "" the authors VBD . Led by Timothy Lenton , professor of NN NN and NNP NN NN at the NNP of Exeter , in southwest England , the team identified nine areas where they VBP tipping points are already underway . The team claims that these events are interconnected and NN in PRP will impact another , causing a worsening "" cascade "" of crises . The researchers VBD early results from preliminary models suggest the NN is much more sensitive than JJ thought and that a JJ tipping point is possible . "" Research last NN analyzed 30 types of regime shift spanning physical NN and ecological systems , from collapse of the West Antarctic NN sheet to a switch from rainforest to savanna , "" they added . "" This indicated that exceeding tipping points in CD NN can increase the NN of crossing them in others . "" The idea of a NN tipping point is not JJ . The UN Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) introduced the concept 20 NNS ago . Back then , the UN suggested such "" JJ - scale discontinuities "" MD only come about when JJ NN exceeded 5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels . But the authors VBP NNS from the CD most recent IPCC reports in 2018 and September 2019 , suggest tipping points can happen between 1 C and 2 C of NN . The model highlighted the consequences of how the interactions between a variety of NN NN factors , such as the loss or weakening of NN sinks , forest dieback , NN retreat and increased bacteria respiration , MD combine to form a feedback loop which accelerates NN NN . The authors acknowledge that there are limits to their understanding of NN tipping , and further investigation is needed . But they VBP the possible impact MD be so huge and "" irreversible "" that "" to err on the side of danger is not a responsible option . "" In other words , not acting is "" too risky to bet against "" in their view . And NN is of the essence . Hope is not lost , however . Researchers VBP that mitigating NN gas NNS MD still slow down the accumulation of these NN impacts . What is needed , they VBP , is urgent international NN to cut NNS , slow NN level rise , and to keep NN to 1.5 C . "" A saving grace is that the rate at which damage accumulates from tipping -- and hence the NN posed -- MD still be under our NN to some extent , "" they VBD . "" The stability and resilience of our NN is in peril . International NN -- not just words -- must reflect this . """

In the stratosphere , NNS above NNP ’s NN , JJ , airborne particles reflect sunlight back into NN , which leads to a cooling influence at the ground . These particles are RB called “ aerosols , ” and the JJ paper explores their recent NN effects — the reasons behind their increase remain the subject of ongoing research . “ Since the NN 2000 , stratospheric aerosols have caused a slower rate of NN NN than we MD have seen without them , ” VBZ John Daniel , a physicist at the NOAA NNP NNP Research Laboratory ( ESRL ) in Boulder , Colo . and an author of the JJ NN . In fact they VBP that the NN is rapid and doubled in the decade : They then admit they do n’t VB the source of these aerosols but give this speculation : Introducing aerosols into the upper atmosphere is call SRM for Solar Radiation Management . Here is the Huges patent describing how it is done : ( Link ) A method is disclosed for reducing atmospheric NN due to the NN effect resulting from a NN gases layer . The method comprises the step of seeding the NN gas layer with a quantity of tiny particles of materials … Such materials can include the class of materials VBN as Welsbach materials . The oxides of metal , e.g. , aluminum oxide , are RB suitable for the purpose . CD technique proposed to seed the metallic particles was to add the tiny particles to the fuel of jet airliners , so that the particles MD be emitted from the jet engine exhaust while the airliner was at its cruising altitude . Here is an extensive report on how to do it and how much it MD cost : Aurora Report So NOAA is showing these aerosols are mysteriously appearing in the upper atmospher , admit they do n’t VB why … yet there is lots of active JJ NN to spread these same aerosols ….. hmmmm …. So if it ’s in the air , are we seeing it fall to the ground ? I mean if they are spraying aluminum we MD VB it affecting plants and animals RB ? Extremely high quantities of aluminum , barium , strontium , and other metals and chemicals are showing up in rainwater , NN NN and air . In just the last four NNS , citizens in the Pacific Northwest ( Northern CA , Oregon ) have taken dozens of tests where the levels of aluminum , for example , has escalated hundreds of times from the JJ tests , which were already unusually high . Some tests of single rain events had elevated nearly 50,000 % from the original 7 ppb . These tests correspond with the NN of California ’s own test results … This NNS matches NNS from other citizen and JJ groups testing nationwide as well as Europe . Dangerous levels of aluminum , barium and other contaminants have saturated most NN waters in much of the US and all NATO NNS . The metals VBD exactly match the primary elements listed in a host of “ geo-engineering patents ” Patents ( assigned to Hughes Aircraft , DOD , Raytheon , and others ) describe the specific goal of creating artificial cloud cover ( reflecting , therefore cooling ) , and other forms of NN / NN modification . The California Air Quality Resources Board has studied aerosols migrating from NNP and these rainwater and air metals ( matching the patents ) are not present in rain or air approaching our continent . The contamination begins on - shore , though clearly just off - shore as well . Recent soil testing and analysis reveals that soil PH ’s are now changing tremendously . A number of studies VBP conclusively that bio-available aluminum is highly detrimental to countless organisms , including conifers .. Sierra Nevada firs have died or begun dying by the stands , RB in riparian areas where they never lack NN . In the same four NNS ( California ) , alarming declines in amphibians have RB been observed . Aluminum drives PH towards base ( alkaline ) , RB severely affecting the forests . Maybe we are finding the reasons for all the mass die offs … Birds , snakes , bats , bees , all sorts of aquatic wildlife are being affected . There was a recent report in England about how the snakes are in rapid decline and there is an unpublished report they are working on in the US that shows the same thing . The females are dying faster than the males and CD NN is because they store fat for breeding which is being loaded with toxic chemicals . It is not proof positive , but a good circumstantial NN . We are getting closer to clear NN someone has begun geoengineering . Our NN has a JJ history of lieing RB , admitting later . Look at MK ULTRA , radiation experiments , and JJ JJ more : They called Elmer Allen crazy because he was telling the NN he was a JJ ginny pig for radiation experiments … they only admitted it after he was dead and gave the family NN for damages . doe.gov"

This project is called Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment ( SCoPEx ) and will be about three CD dollars RB off the bat just for testing . Through this experiment , Harvard officials hope to advance their understandings on stratospheric aerosols in general so that it can be determined whether they are actually useful or not . It is thought that these researchers will be able to reduce their levels of uncertainty and determine the risks and benefits of solar geoengineering . If these sprays MD potentially eliminate or reduce our ozone loss in the JJ run without risks , we might have a good solution for now . Harvard wrote as follows on the experiment itself : At the heart of SCoPEx is a propelled scientific balloon that can travel a few meters per second ( walking speed ) relative to the surrounding air . The propellers serve CD functions . RB , the propeller wake forms a well - mixed volume ( roughly 1 km JJ and 100 meters in diameter ) that serves as an experimental ‘ beaker ’ in which we can add gasses or particles . Second , the propellers allow us to fly the gondola back and forth through the volume to measure the properties of the perturbed air . The advantage of the SCoPEx propelled balloon is that it allows us to create a JJ controlled volume of stratospheric air and observe its evolution for ( we hope ) over 24 hours . Hence the acronym , Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment . If we VBD an aircraft instead of a balloon , we MD not be able to use such a JJ perturbed volume nor MD we be able to observe it for such JJ durations . SCoPEx builds on four decades of research on the JJ chemistry of the ozone layer in the Anderson / Keith / Keutsch groups . SCoPEx will use or adapt JJ of the high - performance sensors and flight - NN engineering experience developed for this ozone research . Analyzing these experiments will improve our NN beyond what is currently available within computer models or is measurable with confidence under laboratory conditions . For this experiment , frozen NN will be released or so researchers NN . This being for now until they move forward and release calcium carbonate and other minerals . This whole operation is according to a release funded by the internal Harvard research funds that are provided by Professor David Keith and Frank Keutsch as well as Harvard ’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program . We do not VB what results will be obtained through this but researchers VBP they have a good idea of what will come . According to Forbes , the basis IN this experiment is from studying the effects of JJ volcanic eruptions on the NN ’s NN . Because computer models can only VB so far taking this out into the field and giving it a NN is the next step . This geoengineering technique MD RB VB things . That being VBN , some studies suggest that spraying sunlight reflective particles into the atmosphere MD have lots of consequences and kill off crops or VB NN patterns at the very least . To learn more about SCoPEx please feel free to click here . While this report is older , it is still full of a lot of NN on the experiment itself . This experiment is set to begin in 2019 as far as in the field things VBP . What do you VB about all of this ?"

Populist legislator Thierry Baudet last week “ surged into the Dutch JJ mainstream as the biggest winner in nationwide elections . "" According to Katholiek Nieuwsblad , he is the “ the JJ face of Dutch populism , ” appealing to JJ Catholics who have felt politically homeless . Baudet is against mass migration , skeptical of NN NN , and an outspoken critic of the “ cartel party , ” in reference to the elite Dutch JJ establishment . [ RELATED ] 4.2 CD Americans Abandon The Catholic Church In Protest Of Pope Francis Earlier this NN , Francis blamed the shortcomings of globalization on the rapid rise of nationalism . Francis did not highlight any specific NNS of JJ parties but reflected on national policies favoring "" quick partisan consensus "" over patient efforts for the common good . The Pontiff expressed worry that Europe and North NNP are limiting their acceptance to migrants in his speech to diplomats accredited to the Vatican . Three Dutch practicing Catholics were interviewed by Katholiek Nieuwsblad , who VBD they sympathize with Forum for Democracy - as the newspaper describes a JJ member , a ‘ dormant ’ member and an active member of the party . The JJ member , Michiel Hemminga , is a philosopher and pro-life who is sympathetic to JJ of the party ’s positions , but critical of others . According to Breitbart : Forum for Democracy suffers from a certain ambiguity in its platform , Hemminga VBD , and some of its positions are untenable for a Catholic . While their opposition to overreaching from the European Union ( EU ) and unchecked migration is open and a viable option for Catholics , on other issues tensions cannot VB but arise . “ According to CD of the party ’s plans , at a certain point all religious NNS should agree to the fact that the Dutch law is above their own religious beliefs , ” Hemminga VBD . “ For me , as a Christian , that ’s not an option . I ’m not suddenly VBG to support gay marriage or abortion , because it ’s the law . ” Erik van Goor , a Catholic convert , publicist , and blogger is an early member of Forum for Democracy , who has hopes that the party will be able to shake up the current JJ NN . “ When I understood that a JJ party was in the making , I was very enthusiastic about it . I do n’t VB what the future holds for the party , but I do VB the current NN needs a breakthrough .

Although Forum for Democracy is not a Christian party , I VBP it ’s the only party who tries to preserve our culture , our democracy , for future generations , ” she VBD . Although there are positions espoused by Baudet that she disagrees with , as a whole , she finds him more convincing than the other candidates . “ I do n’t VB he ’s acknowledging the JJ origin of what he likes to preserve . My hope is that CD day he will , perhaps if he gets married and starts a family , ” she VBD . “ You VBP only to look at the history books to realize that the traditional marriage and the family are essential to all things created within a culture . ” [ RELATED ] Pope Francis Calls on Migrants to Flood the US : ' Forget National Security '"

Researchers have shown that the Great Dying , which killed almost all of NNP 's ocean creatures IN 250 CD NNS ago , was caused by rising JJ temperates . Continued natural NNS to the NNP 's NN - not to be confused with NNP Gore 's brand of "" NNP NNP "" - MD lead to a repeat of the Great Dying , which killed off 96 percent of NN on NNP , millions of NNS before NNS had RB evolved . NNS VBP that JJ NNS MD again rise to levels that MD be unsustainable for the majority of NN that inhabits our NN . RB before the dawn of the dinosaurs , NNP was populated with plants and animals that were mostly obliterated after a series of massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia . The mass extinction , triggered 252 CD NNS ago , essentially set NN on our NN back to square CD , and was followed by a period spanning millions of NNS in which NN had to multiply and evolve once more . Now researchers have shown that the Great Dying , which killed 96 percent of NNP 's ocean creatures , was caused by JJ NN . As volcanoes belched gases into the atmosphere , NNP 's oceans heated up , and its NN waters MD no longer hold enough oxygen for NN to survive . NNS at the NNP of NNP warned that a similar event MD occur within the next few hundred NNS . "" By 2100 , NN in the upper ocean will have approached 20 percent of NN in the late Permian , and by the NN 2300 it will reach between 35 and 50 percent , "" VBD NN author Justin Penn . "" This NN highlights the potential for a mass extinction arising from a similar mechanism . "" The NNP team ran computer models to simulate the effects of the Great Dying on NNP 's ancient oceans . They showed that sulfur , ash , and other gases pumped into the atmosphere from volcanic eruptions starved NNP 's oceans of 80 percent of their oxygen .

A green fund can come in the form of a focused investment vehicle for NNS engaged in environmentally supportive businesses , such as alternative NN , green transport , NN and waste management , and sustainable living . A green fund 's strategy can be VBN on some of the following characteristics : avoiding negative NN criteria ( businesses such as guns , alcohol , gambling , pornography , animal testing , etc. ) ; choosing positive NN criteria ( JJ programs , NN conservation , fair trade , etc. ) ; or a combination of both strategies . VBN on performance , it is not yet clear whether green funds and socially responsible investing ( SRI ) can consistently create better returns for investors , but they do represent a proactive step toward JJ consciousness , which JJ investors VBP as valuable . Some have cited green investing as having begun in earnest during the 1990s , a period where investors were more seriously taking into account the harm businesses or the pressure entire industries were putting on the environment . In the wake of headline - grabbing events IN the Exxon Valdez oil spill , and JJ and protracted fights over logging rights in the Pacific Northwest , a set of investors began to view businesses that were better at managing their JJ impact as more valuable than those who MD n't . These types of businesses , in some investors ' eyes , were not only operating in a more ethical manner but had a competitive advantage over NNS who were ill - equipped to reduce their impact on the environment . Still , other investors saw an ethical obligation in investing in technologies and businesses that were looking to build a sustainable society through renewable NN sources . Some of the sectors where this investment has been taking place include the renewable NN , and buildings and efficiency sector . The renewable NN sector is a broad NN , including solar NN , wind , battery , and NN storage technologies , as well as the materials that VBP make those technologies possible . The buildings sector includes builders who use NN - efficient materials , making each building 's NN footprint smaller – whether they 're being VBN for commercial , residential , or office use . Socially conscious investing has continued to gain popularity , which is due largely to increased worldwide exposure to the issue of NN NN , as well as increased federal funding for alternative NN and other programs . Since 2007 , the Green Transition Scoreboard , a project run by Ethical Markets NNP and The NNP Prosperity Alliance , has tracked $ 8.1 trillion invested in the green economy through the end of CD , more than halfway to the goal of $ CD trillion invested by 2020 . Some of the green mutual funds that are available include the TIAA - CREF NNP Choice Equity Fund ( TICRX ) ; Portfolio 21 NNP Equity Fund Class R ( PORTX ) 21 ; and the Green Century balanced ( GCBLX ) . NN has poured into green funds as investors seek both socially responsible investments and returns from the uptick in green technologies such as wind and solar NN . Inflows into socially conscious funds quadrupled to more than $ 4.3 trillion from 2012 to 2014 , with the number of funds growing by 28 % . Despite sometimes high fees , the funds have RB garnered relatively solid performance . Socially responsible funds returned 8.1 % versus 8.4 % for non-socially responsible funds over the three NNS ended March 31 , 2018 . For the CD NNS ended on March 31 , 2018 , the funds turned in 8.91 % versus 9.1 % for their non-socially responsible peers ."

NNS from NNP and the Brazilian National Institute for NNP Research ( INPE ) points to stressed NN conditions : the soil is drier , NNS are higher , and groundwater is depleted . Peak rainy season , which runs from December to February , was among the top CD worst on record this NN , with just 75 % of the season ’s usual rainfall . Last NN , wildfire and deforestation in the Amazon hit the highest levels in a decade . But the flames were contained by the rainforest ’s natural humidity after several months of intense rainfall . This NN , the rainforest MD not be so lucky . Since taking office in January 2019 , Brazil ’s NNP Jair Bolsonaro has scaled back JJ protections and pushed to VB the country ’s legislation to open up indigenous reserves to mining and other development activities that are the main drivers of Amazon destruction . The NN has RB cut down on JJ raids amid the NN - CD NN , opening the doors to increased deforestation , wildcat mining and land grabbing . As a result , deforestation this NN increased 51 % through March compared to the JJ quarter of 2019 , according to INPE . The deforestation figure for August 2019 to the end of March 2020 is reportedly nearly twice that of the same period a NN earlier . Adding a drier NN to the mix , experts warn , MD be lethal for the forest , intensifying forest dieback and allowing more untouched , healthy forest to catch fire in the JJ term . Although NN forecasts for the Amazon are highly unpredictable , which MD potentially reverse the current deficit , NN models by Brazil ’s Center for NNP Forecasting and NNP Research ( CPTEC ) show no indication of above - average precipitation in the coming months . “ We are entering a drier season where rains are not [ usually ] intense enough to impact the potential for fire and other factors related to the dry season , ” CPTEC climatologist Diego Jatobá VBD Mongabay . NN shortages in the soil RB after a rainy season RB signal trouble later on in the NN , VBZ NNP scientist and hydrologist Matthew Rodell , who works with NNP ’s Gravity Recovery and NN Experiment Follow - On ( GRACE - FO ) satellites monitoring NN levels stored deep beneath the NNP ’s NN . Their NNS are VBN to predict drought worldwide . Recent GRACE -FO images of South NNP have shown JJ areas of Brazil ’s Amazon and Cerrado biomes in the deep red zone , meaning NN levels are severely impacted . “ If we VBP normal to low precipitation this NN , then there is potential for drought , ” Rodell VBD Mongabay in a telephone interview . “ I MD be concerned . ” But for Ane Alencar , the head of the Amazon NNP Research Institute ( IPAM ) and a specialist in rainforest wildfires , an increase in fires this NN depends far more on JJ decisions than NN conditions , which she expects will be within an average range . “ I have the worst possible expectations about uncontrolled JJ - induced deforestation and fire ignition this NN . Spontaneous combustion does n’t exist in the Amazon , ” she VBD Mongabay . A technical report by IPAM published this week RB anticipates a surge in fires caused by the deforestation spike of 2019 , as the modus operandi of land grabbers is to deforest CD NN then set fire the next , in order to successfully transform forest into farmland and pastures . Drier soil conditions overlap with high deforestation rates . In northern Pará NN , home to 40 % of all deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon last NN , early fires MD happen , NN maps show . In the area IN the city of Santarém , which already has the highest deforestation rates in the Amazon , fires and land clearing MD RB spike after the recent paving of the BR - 163 highway that cuts through the Amazon rainforest , described by Bolsonaro on NNP as “ at the heart of agribusiness . ” The gradual drying of the Amazon has concerned NNS for decades , as it threatens to set off a cycle of forest dieback that MD push the rainforest over its tipping point , turning rainforest into degraded savanna . In recent NNS , extreme NN events IN droughts and floods have increased and published NNS show dry seasons getting longer and more severe . But figures on the Amazon rainy season are JJ . According to rainfall NNS shared with Mongabay by CPTEC , eight of the CD driest rainy seasons in Brazil ’s northern region recorded since 1962 happened after the NN 2000 . “ We have observed a negative trend , a significant sign of reduction in rain through the NNS , ” CPTEC scientist Jatobá VBD Mongabay . Nevertheless , there is still some hope for reversing the current scenario . According to Nepstad , some steps are already being taken by a part of the agribusiness sector to encourage farmers to plant trees . “ Farmers are on the hook to plant 6 CD hectares ( 14.8 CD acres ) in the next 20 NNS , but they often do n’t have enough NN or incentives to do this . This is part of the solution , ” he VBD ."

JJ British chancellor Lord Lawson was the latest to demand an impartial investigation be launched into the scandal , which arrives just weeks before the UN NN conference in Copenhagen . “ They should set up a JJ inquiry under someone who is totally respected and VB to the truth , ” he VBD the BBC Radio Four Today programme . The emails were leaked at the end of last week after hackers penetrated the servers of the Climatic Research Unit , which is VBN at the NNP of East Anglia , in eastern England . The CRU is described as CD of the leading NN research bodies in the NN . The hacked documents and communications reveal how top NNS conspired to falsify NNS in the face of declining JJ NNS in order to prop up the premise that man-made factors are driving NN NN . Others illustrate how they embarked on a venomous and coordinated campaign to ostracize NN skeptics and use their influence to keep dissenting reports from appearing in peer - reviewed journals , as well as VBG cronyism to avoid compliance with Freedom of NNP Act requests . As expected , the establishment NN has gone into whitewash overdrive , characterizing the emails as NN of “ rancor ” amongst the NN community and focusing on some of the lesser emails while ignoring the JJ significance of what has been revealed . Organizations with close ties to the CRU have engaged in psychological terrorism by fearmongering about the NN with doomsday scenarios , illustrating their argument with outlandish propaganda animation videos which show pets drowning and others that show computer - generated polar bears crashing to NN in a throwback to 9/11 victims jumping from the towers , when in reality polar bear population figures are thriving . “ CD of the emails under scrutiny , written by Phil Jones , the centre ’s director , in 1999 , reads : “ I ’ve just completed Mike ’s Nature [ the NN journal ] trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 NNS ( ie , from 1981 onwards ) and from 1961 for Keith ’s to hide the decline , ” reports the London Telegraph . The author admitted to the Associated Press that the e mail was genuine . In another example , researchers discuss NN that is “ artificially adjusted to look closer to the real NNS ” . Apparently , the “ real NNS ” are whatever JJ NN cheerleaders VBP them to be . As Anthony Watts writes , attempts to claim e mails are “ out of context , ” as the defense has been from CRU , cannot apply in this instance . You can claim an email you wrote NNS ago is n’t accurate saying it was “ taken out of context ” , but a programmer making notes in the code does so that he / she can document what the code is actually doing at that stage , so that anyone who looks at it later can figure out why this function does n’t plot past 1960 . In this NN , it is not allowing all of the NN NNS to be plotted . Growing season NNS ( summer months when the JJ tree rings are formed ) past 1960 is thrown out because “ these will be artificially adjusted to look closer to the real NNS ” , which implies some post processing routine . Spin that , spin it to the NN if you VBP . I ’ll VB programmer notes over the word of somebody who stands to gain from suggesting there ’s nothing “ untowards ” about it . Either the NNS tells the story of nature or it does not . NN that has been “ artificially adjusted to look closer to the real NNS ” is JJ NNS , yielding a JJ result . Another email discusses changing NN NNS to fix “ blips ” in studies so as to make them conform with expectations , which of course is the cardinal sin of scientific research . “ NN , collusion in exaggerating NN NNS , possibly illegal destruction of embarrassing NN , organized resistance to disclosure , manipulation of NNS , private admissions of flaws in their JJ claims and much more ” was revealed in the 61 megabites of confidential files released on the Internet for anyone to read , writes Andrew Bolt . Another email appears to celebrate the death of NN NN skeptic John L Daly , with the words , “ In an odd NN this is cheering NN . ” In another communication , the author expresses his fantasy to “ beat the crap out of ” NN NN skeptics . In another exchange , researchers appear to discuss ways to discredit James Saiers of the Geophysical Research Letters journal , by means of an academic witch hunt , because of his sympathies with NN NN skeptics . “ If you VBP that Saiers is in the NN skeptics camp , then , if we can find documentary NN of this , we MD VB through official AGU channels to VB him ousted . ” Other emails express doubt about whether the NN is RB heating up and infer that NNS needs to be reinterpreted . “ The fact is that we ca n’t account for the lack of NN at the moment and it is a travesty that we can ’t . The CERES NNS published in the August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be RB more NN : but the NNS are surely wrong . Our observing NN is inadequate . ” NNS discuss trying to disguise historical NNS that contradicts the man-made NN NN thesis , such as the Medieval Warm Period ( MWP ) , which must be ‘ contained ’ according to CD email . Suppression of NN is RB discussed , with NNS resolving to delete embarrassing emails . “ And , perhaps most reprehensibly , ” writes James Delingpole , a JJ series of communications discussing how best to squeeze dissenting NNS out of the peer review process . How , in other words , to create a scientific NN in which anyone who disagrees with AGW can be written off as a crank , whose views do not have a scrap of authority . ” “ This was the danger of always criticising the skeptics for not publishing in the “ peer - reviewed literature ” . Obviously , they VBD a solution to that –take over a journal ! So what do we do about this ? I VBP we have to stop considering “ NNP Research ” as a legitimate peer - reviewed journal . Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the NN research community to no longer submit to , or cite papers in , this journal . We MD RB VB to consider what we tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial board … What do others VB ? ” “ I will be emailing the journal to tell them I ’m having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor . ” “ It results from this journal having a number of editors . The responsible NN for this is a well - VBN skeptic in NZ . He has let a few papers through by Michaels and Gray in the past . I ’ve had words with Hans von Storch about this , but got nowhere . Another thing to discuss in Nice ! ” NNS RB “ discussed ways of dodging Freedom of NNP Act requests to release NN NNS , ” reports the Daily Mail . The emails show that NNS relied on cronyism and cosying up to FOIA officials to prevent them from being forced to release NNS . “ When the FOI requests began here , the FOI person VBD we had to abide by the requests , ’ the email VBZ . “ It took a couple of half - hour sessions to convince them otherwise . ” “ Once they became aware of the types of NNS we were dealing with , everyone at UEA became very supportive . I ’ve got to VB the FOI person quite well and the chief librarian – who deals with appeals . ” It is important to stress that this compendium merely scratches the NN of the monumental levels of fraud that have been exposed as a result of the hacked emails . NNS will look back on this moment as the beginning of the end for JJ NN alarmism and the agenda to implement draconian measures of regulation and NN along with the levy of a JJ NN tax . JJ more revelations will be forthcoming as a result of this leak , and the desperate effort on behalf of the establishment to whitewash the whole issue will only end up making the damage worse ."

Our_PRP$ response_NN to_IN it_PRP is_VBZ n’t_RB ._.","The JJ strike on Friday September 20 , 2019 was the largest demonstration for NN NN in history . The movement that started with Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg in August 2018 has now mobilised millions , while Extinction Rebellion and other protest groups have escalated their campaigns on streets IN the NN . From the efforts of activists in JJ NNS , radical “ Green JJ Deals ” are emerging as a bold , JJ response to the NN NN . “ The NN is waking up , ” Thunberg VBD NN leaders at the recent UN NNP NNP Summit . “ And NN is coming whether you VBP it or not . ” But how RB that awakening takes MD be decisive for NN this century . A report published ahead of the summit declared that the impacts of NN NN are accelerating – growth rates of NN dioxide ( CO₂ ) in the atmosphere were nearly 20 % higher in the 2015 - CD period than the previous five NNS , while the average rate of NN level rise has increased to 5 mm per NN over roughly the same period . CD author warned that limiting JJ NN rise to 2 °C MD require tripling current commitments to reduce NNS . To hold NNS at 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels , JJ ambition MD VB to increase by a factor of five . The debate over whether NN NN is happening is over , and the conversation about what should be done is beginning in earnest . As such , for the past few weeks , we ’ve asked experts from IN the NN to describe how the NN should respond to the threat of NN breakdown . We share their insights here . The NN of the NNP Nowhere are the effects of NN NN more visible than in the Arctic – a region that ’s estimated to be VBG at least twice as fast as the JJ average . Arctic NN NN reached its second - lowest extent on record in September 2019 – a mere 1.6 m square NNS . A JJ report by the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) has revealed the NNS that are underway in the oceans and the NN - covered regions of the NN , and the message is stark . “ Glaciers and NN sheets are shrinking . JJ NN level is rising at more than twice the rate of the 20th century . The ocean is NN , becoming more acidic and losing oxygen . Fifty percent of coastal wetlands have been lost over the past 100 NNS . NNS are shifting , biodiversity is declining and ecosystems are losing their integrity and function . ” NNP ’s oceans have absorbed more than 90 % of the excess heat in the JJ NN NN , but not without repercussions . Marine heatwaves are causing coral reefs to bleach and mass die - offs of fish and other wildlife . Not only does this added ocean heat wreak havoc on marine ecosystems , but it is changing the relationship between coastal communities and the ocean . Wildlife populations are struggling to adapt to the disruption , both in the oceans and on land . As a result , a landmark report from an international team of biodiversity experts earlier in 2019 called for “ transformative NN ” to economies and societies to prevent up to a CD NNS VBG extinct . Five steps to restrain NNS RB now “ The UK , Norway , Sweden and France have written a target of net - zero NNS into law , [ but ] targets are , by definition , a statement of nothing more than intent . In and of themselves , they do not remove a single molecule of NN dioxide from the atmosphere . ” Limiting JJ NN rise to 1.5 °C means the NN has to be at net - zero NN NNS by 2050 . But it ’s cumulative NNS that count – if NNS leave decarbonisation until the last minute , it will be too late . Rebecca Willis , a professor of NN and NN policy at Lancaster NNP in the UK , outlines five measures that can begin to restrain NNS RB now : • None Task all NN departments with a NN agenda so that they ’re obligated to show how their policies will contribute to NNS cuts . • None Engage the NN in developing NN strategies with citizens ’ assemblies and involve workers in designing policy to ensure a “ just transition ” from NN - intensive industries IN coal mining . • None Enact “ symbolic policies ” to set the investment NN and catalyse radical NN – ban advertising for petrol cars for instance , or allow NNS to generate and sell renewable NN at home . • None Keep all remaining fossil fuels in the ground – ban oil and gas exploration and end the US $ 5.2 trillion spent on subsidising the fossil fuel industry each NN . • None Set aside negative emission technologies – NN capture and storage might play a role in absorbing NN gases from the atmosphere in future , but they do n’t exist at a meaningful scale yet . Relying on them distracts resources from cutting NNS now . There are technologies that already exist which are very good at capturing CO₂ . Plants have perfected the process of turning NN in the air into solid , living material over billions of NNS . Natural NN solutions mobilise this potential by restoring forests , wetlands and other habitats . CD estimate from the UK suggests each hectare of JJ forest can absorb the annual NN NNS of 90 cars . But it ’s not as simple as letting nature do all the hard work , VBZ Sebastian Leuzinger , an associate professor at the Auckland NNP of Technology . The “ JJ tree should be planted at the JJ NN in the JJ place ” : • None Tree NNS that grow fast are able to store NN more rapidly , but slower , bigger trees will ultimately store more in the JJ run . • None Non-native trees MD be better at absorbing NN efficiently than native NNS , so keep an open NN to their role . • None When choosing a NN to plant , trust local foresters and the community that will have to live alongside and nurture them . Natural NN solutions can RB VB society adapt to the inevitable NNS ahead . Zita Sebesvari , head of JJ vulnerability and ecosystem services at NNP Nations NNP , argues that the value of rewilding here is CD - fold : removing the CO₂ that exacerbates NN NN while mitigating its impacts . How to feed the NN Leaving room for nature seems radical when NNS currently exploit more than 70 % of the NNP ’s NN - free NN , much of it to grow food . It ’s estimated that a third of all NN gas NNS originate with agriculture – from deforesting farmland to raising livestock that belch methane . Farming for meat and dairy can use up to 100 times the land area to produce a single gram of NN compared to beans , nuts and other plant sources . Little wonder that NNS are encouraged to eat less of it , and Alessandro Demaio , a fellow in JJ NN at the NNP of Copenhagen , recommends a “ planetary NN diet ” which involves reducing meat intake in Western NNS by 50 % . He RB calls for : • None Recycling organic waste as fertiliser and investing in agroforestry – where trees are grown IN crops to increase biodiversity . • None Breeding drought - resistant crop strains , making animal feed more nutritious and creating additives that can make livestock emit 30 % less methane . Sean Beer , a lecturer in agriculture at Bournemouth NNP , argues that eating more local and seasonal produce MD VB some NN to decarbonising agriculture . Reviving traditional food supply systems MD RB be key to guaranteeing sustainable diets for all , VBZ Jagannath Adhikari , a sessional lecturer at the NNP of NNP South Wales . In parts of the Himalayas , the answer to this problem is “ food forests ” . Local NNS plant useful trees and grow crops in the woodland near their homes , and protect what grows there naturally . They harvest what they VBP – mushrooms , honey , roots and edible plants – and sell any surplus at a NN . Since community rights were restored to forest management here , worrying trends in deforestation and poverty have been reversed . Some politicians are now supporting policies that address NN NN by transforming national economies under the umbrella of a Green NNP Deal . Spain ’s socialist party was recently reelected on a Green NNP Deal platform , for example , and , in the UK , the Labour Party has voted in favour of CD . The idea was born in the UK in 2007 , but has been gaining ground IN the NN lately , especially in the US where it has been championed by congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez . Although the specifics vary , a Green NNP Deal involves JJ investments in clean NN sector jobs and infrastructure to decarbonise the economy and correct inequalities through job guarantees and universal basic services such as free JJ transport and healthcare . Governments MD RB be expected to slash or eliminate the billions they spend on subsidising the cost of fossil fuels . Experts RB urge for the inclusion of the insurance industry in Green NNP Deal discussions . A recent report from Cambridge NNP emphasised the JJ losses insurers will face under NN NN and warns that it MD spark a JJ financial NN . >“ If governments respond appropriately to the urgent warning issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) in October [ 2018 ] , efforts to phase out fossil fuels will have to ramp up considerably — and quickly . ” Already , there has been a slew of lawsuits against the largest fossil fuel NNS in an effort to hold them accountable for misleading the NN on the risks of NN NN while selling NNS that have contributed to it . Litigation , thus far , has not been successful , but the tide MD be turning . In the US , more than a dozen cities , counties and NNS are seeking damages from NN NNS for the the costs of NN NN , from retrofitting storm drains to upgrading NN walls . These lawsuits draw on litigation against tobacco NNS and on scientific research that attributes NN gas NNS to NN NNS . In the past , “ the plaintiffs had difficulties tracing NN harms to specific NNS made by particular corporations … Scientific research has evolved dramatically since then . ” VBZ Lisa Benjamin , from Lewis & Clark College of Law , in Portland , Oregon . For example , in Europe , a German NN has agreed to hear a Peruvian farmer ’s NN against the German NN giant RWE for its role in melting the glaciers near his hometown of Huaraz and raising the risks of landslides and flooding . A NN VBD RWE was responsible for 0.47 % of historic NNS , so the farmer is seeking 0.47 % of the cost for his community to adapt to NN NN . As the impacts of NN NN become more clear , Thunberg ’s not the only NN questioning the “ fairy tales of eternal JJ growth ” . Producing stuff consumes NN , and producing more stuff , whether it ’s fast fashion or smartphones , means the ongoing and growing consumption of NN . “ This makes it very hard to decarbonise the economy , ” VBZ Simon Mair at the NNP of Surrey . If we stopped chasing productivity growth , decarbonisation MD come easier , we ’d have less “ crap ” and we might start investing NN and JJ NN into good jobs that matter , IN teaching and nursing . The NN is finally listening to the experts Despite the potentially massive implications of a 2 °C rise in JJ NN , NN NN has remained low on the NN agenda . Journalists and their NN organisations have largely failed to give NN VB the attention it deserves and have failed to press JJ figures on NN issues and policies . NNS ago , NN journalists threw away the notion of putting scientific fact and NN denier opinion on equal ground . Other NNS are finally catching up and providing analysis and verification , and improving the scientific literacy of their audience . They are connecting NN NN to local stories , focusing on solutions ( instead of “ doom and gloom ” coverage ) and adjusting their language to describe the “ NN NN ” . These shifts in journalism MD yield more NN on NN NN . Young NNS tend to avoid negative NN headlines ; they do n’t VB their NN coverage to present a bleak and certain future . Instead , they VBP stories about the “ NN NN ” necessary to create zero- NN societies , VBZ Julie Doyle , from the NNP of Brighton . It ’s not that they ca n’t handle the bad NN , but that “ they wanted to be involved in rethinking socioeconomic systems , and are inspired and empowered by working together . ” That ’s why “ NN NN not NN NN ” has became the rallying cry of the young NN strikers . Thunberg ’s journey from a lonely vigil outside the Swedish parliament to a Nobel Peace Prize nominee at the head of a JJ movement took just over a NN . It seems the NN RB is waking up , but now comes the hard part – changing the systems that fuel the NN NN before it ’s too late . This article was amended on November 12 2019 to clarify an error . The earlier story VBD JJ NNS of NN dioxide grew by 20 % between 2015 and 2019 . Instead , growth rates of NN dioxide were nearly 20 % higher in the 2015 - CD period than the previous five NNS .

""_''","TOPEKA , Kan . -- Environmentalists are struggling to VB lawmakers to RB discuss NN NN as a serious issue in Kansas , where some leaders of the Republican - controlled Legislature question the widespread scientific consensus that JJ activity is dangerously VBG the NN . NNS such as Virginia , Minnesota and California are pursuing goals for eventually getting all of their electricity from renewable resources . But Kansas proposals aimed at reducing electricity use , making NN office NN more NN efficient and encouraging farmers to capture and store NN gases have languished without committee hearings . Environmentalists had to schedule their own NN NN hearing earlier this month outside of lawmakers ' regular meetings . RB more galling for them , a NNP committee 's JJ foray Thursday into JJ policy was a hearing on a business - backed measure to bar cities and counties from banning single - use plastic bags or straws . Some Republicans worry about the costs of pursuing initiatives for consumers , farmers and businesses , questioning whether Kansas MD effectively lessen the problem . But some of them doubt it 's a problem compelling enough to address and express opinions at odds with most NNS ' views . “ The NN goes in cycles , and it's a natural cycle , "" VBD NNP Majority Leader Dan Hawkins , a Wichita Republican . “ They VBP that the globe is VBG . And guess what ? If you VBP back through history , it did , and then it cools down , and then it warms and then it cools down . ” Rabbi Moti Rieber , executive director of the Kansas Interfaith Alliance , VBD lawmakers have avoided tackling NN NN in recent NNS "" as the situation continues to VB worse . "" Of the 71 CD - dollar natural disasters the federal NN VBZ have affected Kansas over the past 40 NNS , more than half , or 37 , occurred in the past decade , RB with damage figures adjusted for inflation . “ It 's frustrating beyond belief , "" Rieber VBD during the hearing on the NN dealing with plastic bags . "" We 're fiddling while the NN burns . ” Oil and natural gas production remain an important industry in Kansas , but it 's RB made JJ strides on clean NN because of a wind - farm boom over the past decade . Wind is generating close to 40 % of the NN 's NN , only a little less than coal - fired plants do , according to the U.S. NNP NNP Administration . CD decades ago , coal - fired plants generated more than 70 % . And NN dioxide NNS in 2017 were 12 % lower than they were in 1980 , according to federal statistics . But Sierra Club lobbyist Zack Pistora VBD Kansas MD eventually VB all of its electricity from renewable resources because its use of solar now is minimal . Virginia lawmakers are working on legislation to meet such a goal by 2050 , while a 2018 California a law sets the marker for 2045 . “ If we do n't recognize that we VBP to do something about this , I feel IN the costs are just VBG to VB greater , ” Pistora VBD . Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is concentrating on making the NN 's NN policy office independent of the commission that regulates utilities , arguing that a separate agency MD be better able to draft a JJ - term NN plan . She issued an executive order last month , but a NNP committee recommended its rejection by the full chamber , which MD block the move . Kelly 's chief of staff , Will Lawrence , VBD a Senate committee this week that Kelly is pursuing an “ all of the above ” NN strategy and sees NN as “ JJ development . ” “ NNS feel the discussion of NN NN will be taking away things from NNS when we RB VBP to concentrate on , how can we best adapt to what 's happening ; how can we be positive ? "" VBD Francisco , whose northeast Kansas district includes the liberal NNP of Kansas campus . The leaders of the NNP and Senate utilities committees VBD the potential costs of initiatives versus their potential benefits is a key issue . They VBD they do n't VB to take steps that , for example , increase the costs of farmers ' tractors by tens of thousands of dollars for JJ improvements in pollution controls . “ Kansans are RB very practical , ” VBD Senate Utilities Committee Chairman Ty Masterson , a Wichita - area Republican . “ They VBP to do something that makes JJ sense to them . ” And Senate NNP Susan Wagle , a Wichita Republican , questioned whether it 's practical for Kansas to pursue NN NN as an issue without NNS reductions by foreign nations . Wagle is a candidate for the U.S. Senate and recently criticized a JJ GOP congressional NN plan , arguing that it is “ kind of silly ” to propose spending “ a lot of taxpayer dollars ” when NNP 's and India 's NN gas NNS MD more than cancel out any benefits . “ I VBP the NN is changing , but I do n't VB scientific consensus on , an agreement on , what the NN factors are or the resolution , ” Wagle VBD . “ As RB as there is not agreement in the scientific community and among all the major nations for what should be done , it 's all for naught .

Transcription_NN by_IN Linda_NNP Leblanc_NNP ,_, with_IN formal_JJ corrections_NNS of_IN the_DT Interview_NN from_IN April_NNP 9_CD ,_, 2019_CD","ER Editor : We draw the reader ’s attention to a piece we published by Prof. Claudia von Werlhof from 2 NNS ago titled The NNP Is Not VBG Up But Drying Out ! Professor Claudia von Werlhof wrote to Greta Thunberg . ( VB featured image ) In this letter Von Werlhof VBZ that the disruption of the JJ NN is not due to CO2 . Questions arose from this letter for Silvia Terribili , who asked von Werlhof to give an interview for her radio show Onda Italiana on salto.nl , April 9th . Below is the transcript of the interview . Claudia Von Werlhof : The question is how we define NN NN and its alleged reason , of which it is VBN it is CO2 . We consider NN NN , at least in the official discussion , as “ JJ NN ” and this JJ NN does n’t exist . There are NNS from NNP , which is the North NNP NNP Agency , and they show that in the last 18 NNS there was no general JJ NN . What exist indeed – because we are not deniers of the problem – are NNS in JJ dimensions in the NN , in the NN and more so in the atmosphere , etc . We are VBG to explain this more in this interview . The second is the CO2 - question , which is now very prominent as all these young NNS are now on the street because they VBP in this story and this dogma of the CO2 . And this is very strange because a lot of NNS , real NNS , are denying the influence of CO2 as a reason for NN NN or as an influence at all . For example , there are about 30,000 NNS in the US now who VBP that there is no problem with CO2 . They VBP that CO2 is not at all detrimental for the NN , and that it RB is something we are to welcome and that we VBP for our trees and plants and as a positive effect . So , the funny thing is that CO2 is often shown as some dirt , as if it was a dirt in the air . Then you look at the factories that are shown in this opportunity , you VBP the dust coming out of them , etc . This is not CO2 . CO2 is a gas that is invisible and does n’t smell , so you do n’t VB it . In general , the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is about . Most of that is vapour , NN vapour , some 80 or 70 % . So , all these NNS who are serious NNS , are denying a negative influence of CO2 on the NN . There are RB winners of the Nobel Prize etc. , IN Ivar Giaever , who are explaining it or NNS from the MIT , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , IN Richard Lindzen and others . The IPCC , the International Panel on NNP NNP , founded at the end of the ’ 80s of the last century , however , is not so much a scientific but a JJ organization , and it is propagating and proposing the CO2 myth to the NN . So , this is a JJ question , and from the point of view of a real scientist , CO2 is not RB something detrimental and is not changing any NN . It ’s too tiny for that . If you look at the origins of this debate at the end of the ‘ 80s , you VBP that before this NN all the NN spoke about a possible NN age , a JJ NN age . Lowell Ponte , f.i. , wrote a book on “ The Cooling ” . It was in 1976 . They spoke about a cooling and a JJ NN age in contrast to the JJ NN - speech of today . There is no historical debate any more about how this myth about CO2 came about . The IPCC was founded by NNP Tanks IN the Club of Rome , the NNP Watch Institute , the Rockefellers , etc. , NNS who have a JJ interest in the whole question . And they VBD , I VBP it was an analysis by William Engdahl , who VBD they VBD or invented the myth of CO2 in order to have a common enemy defined which is humanity itself . Humanity is guilty of producing so much CO2 by civil industry and consumption . This ideology can be VBN for another , a JJ policy . So , this was the origin of the CO2 myth and this has been their propaganda worldwide . Then came NNP Gore and everybody believes in him . This is contrasting with the fact that This history is generally not VBN . And NNS do n’t RB VB anything about Nature and the NNP . There is a certain ignorance generally , and There are a lot of NNS in the NN , in the NN , in JJ aspects , IN those Dr. Rosalie Bertell VBD out , we ’ll speak about her later , who VBD we are wrecking our NN . But how ? It ’s not by JJ NN , but by something totally JJ . This is not mentioned by these NNS who speak about NN NN . They do n’t VB that there are NNS , but there are JJ ones with very JJ origins . Silvia Terribili : Yes , it seems RB that computer models predicting catastrophic JJ NN in the coming NNS are parameterized , and there is a NN of framing the outcome of these methods and models . Can you VB something about these models ? CvW : These models the IPCC is VBG are computer models . Their results are just an outcome of computer simulation . It has nothing to do with reality , and what they are measuring is what they VBP to measure . They just measure something IN more CO2 - output , but they do not consider the complexity of the NN on this NN . They have no parameters about them and so they are RB trying to fool us with what they are saying about such a JJ amount of NN NN and JJ NN . This is not happening , and it will not happen because of CO2 . So , these are strange methods , and not scientific ones . PRP should VB they are JJ methods which VBP to prove something which is not the NN . So , there is no reason why there should be such an amount of JJ NN of above 4 degrees , which is impossible . At least it is impossible with simply putting CO2 as a measure of this tiny amount of CO2 in the air . You MD never have any effect , and it is very funny that everybody is believing this nonsense . It ’s a NN , but it has nothing to do with reality , and we should look at why this NN exists . So , this is the more important question . ST : Some 30 NNS ago we were being warned that the protective ozone layer had been reduced . Nowadays we do n’t seem to care anymore about ozone depletion in the stratosphere . How MD this be explained because we have to be concerned about the depletion of the ozone layer and where it comes from . CvW : The ozone question , yes . This is a very funny thing again , and it is not funny at all in the end because the ozone layer is RB something that we VBP . Without the ozone layer there MD be no NN on NN , because it protects us from cosmic radiation from the NN , especially UV - B and - C radiation , which is very toxic . And it has been VBN that this radiation today is coming down to NN , which normally is prevented by the ozone layer . But now it comes through , and this is a JJ story because there was the Montreal Protocol in the ‘ 80s which prohibited the use of CFCs , all these chemicals you have in the refrigerators , etc. , because they thought it was the reason for the ozone hole . But this was already wrong then because we VBP that what was RB damaging the ozone was particularly radioactivity . Of radioactivity , there has been a lot in the air since the NN had been experimenting with nuclear explosions from the ‘ 40s and ‘ 50s until the end of the ‘ 90s , and we had about 2,200 nuclear explosions on NN and in the atmosphere , and This is the main reason for the weakness of this layer because radioactivity is somehow eating up the ozone so that it is suffocating in a NN , because ozone is a sort of atmospheric oxygen and radioactivity finishes the oxygen . The problem is something IN suffocation , and the toxic effect of radiation coming down to NN when this layer is destroyed or inhibited . Last NN , the NNS who were measuring the ozone layer VBD that it was weaker than ever ; it did not recover as was proposed after the Montreal Protocol . And they VBD out that , on the contrary , it is not only existing in the form of holes over the Antarctic and the Arctic – the latter CD existing only since Fukushima , as there was never a hole over the Arctic before . And now we have ozone depletion RB over the whole northern part of the NN . So , the toxic radiation is not only occurring at the poles but generally it comes down and it is destroying a lot of plants and lower animal NN , IN insects . With the insects dying , the birds and the whole food chain is affected by the weakness of the ozone layer , and in the oceans the plankton is dying and the krill that the JJ fish are eating . You have now JJ fish who are dying from hunger and you have dying coral reefs IN , for example , the Great Barrier Reef east of NNP Zealand , the biggest NN in the NN , which is now dying , and it is almost not reproducing itself anymore . NNS VBP it is because the oceans are VBG up , but this can not be the real reason . The main problem is that the toxic radiation from the NN comes down into the NN as well , and it is killing NN in the oceans . And then you have all this radioactivity from Fukushima which has been led into the Pacific so that NN in the Pacific is dying out , and soon you will have no fish anymore . This is somehow very tragic because Rosalie Bertell wrote her book “ NNP NNP , the Latest Weapon of NNP ” already in 2000 . She has studied all these problems , and where they come from , and she always warned about the ozone layer , And she VBD that with a 20 % thinning of the ozone layer there will be no agriculture anymore , because the plants will be destroyed by the toxicity of UV radiation . You can VB it RB on your balcony when you have your plants out there . It can already be seen that the leaves are getting brown and your plants are not growing much in the NN . So , this is maybe the biggest problem we are facing and the result of JJ , JJ effects which are destroying the ozone layer not only with the radioactivity , but RB other instruments and technologies worse than any CO2 or JJ NN . ST : What can we VB about geoengineering and especially Stratospheric Aerosol Injection which is CD of the technologies that the IPCC is in a NN not suggesting , but they VBP it can be a solution for the JJ NN . What do you VB ? CvW : Well , because of this NN NN of JJ NN and CO2 , we now have civil geoengineers appearing , something that did n’t exist in previous times . Now they have their research institutes everywhere , and plan to have a solution to this problem which is supposed to be “ solar radiation management ” SRM or SAI , with which they are planning to inject aerosols into the air to block the NN from shining and from heating up the NN . So , instead of removing CO2 , because it seems impossible politically , they are promoting this other solution to fight against the effects of so - called JJ NN , and this MD mean blocking the NN from shining too much on NN . So , the plan is to inject aerosols into the atmosphere , and especially David Keith from Harvard NNP has a project called SCOPEX for this very process . In this project he wants to inject RB sulphuric acid into the atmosphere imitating something IN a volcanic eruption , which they call the Pinatubo effect because the Pinatubo is a volcano that exploded in 1991 and the ashes and what came out had the effect of cooling down the NNS . And now they are trying to imitate this effect by adding sulphuric acid into the air . Recently David Keith , this professor from Harvard NNP , RB VBD that tens of thousands of NNS MD die from that at least , because it MD mean having acids rain down on NN , which MD eventually destroy all NN . I mean , these are crazy experiments they are preparing , and they VBP for civil geoengineers and the funniest thing about this movement of civil geoengineers is that they do not speak of the JJ background of all these technologies they are now propagating . And all these movements about NN NN , etc. , do n’t VB anything about it as well . It is simply denied that these are JJ experiments which we VBP already , becauseI mean something IN SRM is nothing JJ . We have it already in the form of the spraying of barium and aluminium and other substances that are very bad for all NN and agriculture . Monsanto for example invented a seed that is resistant to aluminium , imagine . So , things IN that are occurring and the NNS are against it , but they do n’t VB that these experiments are a reality already , being a part of geoengineering , JJ geoengineering , that has existed now for about 70 or more NNS . This has been a project of the Second NNP NNP in which the NN invented the nuclear as a weapon of NN and after the nuclear , they invented other weapons IN those of NN NN . As Rosalie Bertell VBD , they invented NN wars , they invented geoengineering and they invented plasma weapons which are electromagnetic weapons VBN by and emitted by ionospheric heaters . This is a very special technology mostly not VBN about , which is VBN on the inventions of Nicola Tesla , who was a physicist inventor in the 19th and 20th century . So , this is a special technology which is not very well VBN , likein Alaska ( now closed down ) which is CD of these ionospheric heaters that are working with electromagnetic waves . This is a very , very dangerous technology which can RB be VBN for producing all kinds of so - called natural catastrophes IN , for example , tsunamis or earthquakes , volcanic eruptions or the NN of the NN in whole regions , or producing hurricanes , droughts , fires and floods , and RB changing the ocean currents . These are technologies that are not discussed in NN but have existed since the Vietnam NNP . They have been invented during this NN and the UN Convention on NNP Modification , the famous ENMOD convention from 1977 , explains these weapons , it explains the effects they MD have when they are VBN . So , it is not RB a secret and it is decades ago that they were invented and were in experimentation , and it is IN a NN that is fought against the NN and the NN as a cosmic macro - being on which we depend . This is very , very dangerous and it is exactly Rosalie Bertell who has explained to us how these technologies function , namely as the post - nuclear weapons of electromagnetic mass destruction . We have these ionospheric heaters now everywhere . ST : What is the ionospheric heater ? What is it , why do they use it ? What is the idea ? We do n’t understand because there is JJ NN , they VBD that there is a JJ NN . So , you are heating the ionosphere , but that ’s crazy . CvW : They are heating up the ionosphere , the sphere in the atmosphere that starts at about 80 kilometres up to about 800 - 1,000 kilometres . It is an electrified part of the atmosphere and when they send the electromagnetic waves up there , they are heating it up because when they heat the ionosphere , this part of the atmosphere , they can manage these electromagnetic rays so that they come down on NN again , by making a curve . They can work with an angle and , IN Rosalie VBD , These rays can RB pass through the core of the NN . ST : But it is RB VBG , so it is completely crazy because we have too much NN and we are sending some … CvW : Because the NN is up there . It ’s not down here . If there is any NN , it is up there . The NNP did n’t find a real NN of the NN in general , but you have JJ parts of the NN that are VBG up or have been warmed up IN the poles , the polar regions and the mountains where the melting glaciers are , but it has nothing to do with a general JJ NN through CO2 . Some of them are surely effects of the JJ use of ionospheric heaters . For example , in 1974 there was a treaty between the US and the Soviet Union , the secret Vladivostok Agreement in which they planned together to heat up the Arctic because they wanted the NN to VB away to VB to the oil on the floor of the northern NN , and they MD n’t VB there because of the NN . Today , half of the Arctic NN has melted down already , because they VBD electromagnetic waves for that . ELF waves , that are extremely low frequency waves and they have thawed the Arctic with that . It has nothing to do with JJ NN but with this JJ technology . ST : VBG back to geoengineering , the solar radiation management , do we have NN that the program is on ? I mean , we VBP all kinds of trails in the sky , and the sky is completely sometimes completely covered by these trails . They are persistent , staying the whole NN . What do you VB about that phenomenon ? CvW : It is an older JJ technology which has been implemented for about 30 NNS . This started in the ‘ 90s and , for example , you have effects in regions IN Shasta in California . They have been heavily sprayed with aerosols . It ’s IN Agent Orange that was sprayed on Vietnam , a toxic product from Monsanto and it ’s IN that . It ’s toxic and , for example , in this community of Shasta in Northern California , the land is not producing anymore , everybody is sick , and the animals and plants are dying . They had such a load of toxic materials , aerosols coming down from the sky that they got these problems , and after having analysed them , they made a JJ event some NNS ago to protest publicly against the sprayings . Nevertheless , the alternative and JJ movements do not accept – RB ETC Group , which is very important in that respect – that this has been done , which is a reality for the NNS affected , and they are denying that SRM is already being VBN and discussing only the bad effects which this method MD have on us . So , they are against it , but they are denying that these methods are in use already everywhere . Of course , you VBP it in the sky , and I have done some research about why they are doing it , as the NN is not interested in any JJ NN myth . They are RB denying JJ NN because they VBP better . ST : So , they are doing that ? CvW : Yes , they are doing that , so they VBP better , IN NNP , who knows it from the NN . But I VBD out that they are not interested in the JJ NN question or so . They are doing it because of the ozone depletion , f.i . If there is an ozone hole or weakness , they cannot pass their electromagnetic waves . They VBP what I call a replacement atmosphere . They VBP to spray aerosols as a conductor , they VBP an atmosphere that is conductive , and at the holes it is not . This is the reason why they are VBG so JJ metals in the spraying , heavy metals IN barium and strontium and aluminium , which is not a heavy metal , but they are all conductive for electromagnetic waves . Recently I came across some research by a woman called Schmitt who lives in Venezuela . She made an analysis of these sprayings as being protective against the cosmos , something IN a Faraday cage , producing a sort of grid IN the NN to protect it from radiation coming in and this RB has to do with the ozone depletion . The ozone layer is RB the central question that has to be an alarm for us , because this is now the moment of truth . When we are not able to prevent these things happening , this destruction happening , we will die out within 20 or 30 NNS . ST : But the official story , nobody is telling , talking about the ozone depletion . CvW : No . There was an alarm last NN and there was a colleague in the US , Marvin Herndon , who was doing research about that question , together with his colleagues and he published it . He proved that ozone depletion leads to the arrival of toxic radiation down on NN . And he VBD out that NNP , the North NNP NNP Agency , had already come to the same result in 2007 . And they did n’t do anything . They already knew it then , but they did n’t do anything because the NN thinks it can do everything it wants . If they VBP it , they MD invent a JJ ozone layer . This is what they VBP . They VBP they have … CvW : Yes , and they VBP that they can do whatever they VBP to do and prevent things from happening . But after all these nuclear explosions in the atmosphere and in the ionosphere and in the Van Allen belts , which destroyed parts of the magnetic field of the NN , they MD never replace or cure the magnetic field nor the atmosphere . They MD n’t do anything about it . They destroyed it and it is destroyed . This is CD of the reasons for NN NNS as well . So , there are a lot of very complex reasons as to why things are happening . For example , you can RB use electromagnetic waves from the ionospheric heaters in order to move the jet stream , which consists of fast winds surrounding the NN , building a frontier between hot and cold . So , if you are moving them north , you have the heat from the south in the north , and when you are moving them down south , you have the cold from the Arctic in the middle of Europe … ST : They strongly influence the NN and the NN CvW : With these technologies , you can do nearly everything , and you can VB the vapour streams that are the humid streams IN the NN . You can transport humidity to Arabia for example . This is CD of the biggest businesses today , because the NNS there VBP NN and you can just transport the NN from here to there . So , RB snow is coming down in the South Arabian desert . This is all manipulation , NN manipulation , NN manipulation . Nobody speaks about it , but it is occurring constantly . And another effect of the atmosphere being full of metal is that it is drying out , so we have much less rain in Europe , for example , which has nothing to do with NN or CO2 . ST : In Italy there is drought . CVW : Italy is drying out , and then you have fires which are RB induced , not only because it is dry , but you have directed NN weapons and laser weapons . So , you can produce these fires that were happening in Portugal and Australia and in California . They have nothing to do with wildfires , and they are not destroying the plants , but . It is IN a NN that has passed through . All these things are discussed as being a result of JJ NN and CO2 . It has nothing to do with that . , so that they do n’t VB what has been done to the NN and to the atmosphere and to the NN , etc. , so they MD n’t look at it because they VBP it is all JJ NN . ST : Unfortunately , we have almost to close the program , but I MD VB to ask you something again . On NNP 23 – 26 , we will have European elections coming . What can we do as concerned Europeans to put NN engineering and all related risks on the electoral agenda because we expect European institutions to protect the 500 CD citizens from the risks of these extremely dangerous technologies . What can we do ? CvW : What we did , inform the NNS . We are just now publishing a book . It is called “ JJ Warning ! ” , not NN , but warning . It is VBG to appear soon . Ten women are explaining their research of what we are talking about now , and this will be published by Talma Studies International in Dublin . So , I can recommend it . The problem is that NNS do n’t VB anything about what is happening IN them , and they do n’t VB informed RB if this is possible . The book of Rosalie Bertell exists in the 4th edition in German , it exists in Italian , French and Spanish . Everybody can read it and JJ NNS have ordered the 4th edition now , it has been printed 15,000 times . Somebody should have read it , but NNS do n’t speak about it . The parties that are running for NN have nothing to do with all this . The Greens should be the most interested in this question , but they are not . We have to look behind the NN NN agenda . There must be somebody who wants NNS to be distracted , to be organized IN other issues . You have the whole Smart City and 5G movement , the technification of the society and a sort of policies of controlled reduction of production and consumption . It is IN the depopulation agenda of certain NNS which seems to be related to that . I VBP that there are other JJ plans , the NNP NNP Order and interests behind it . CO2 is only the scapegoat to prevent NNS from looking at them . The Greens for example are totally involved in these plans for a so called “ green ” economy , but this is not the NN . It is not a green economy . It is a weaponized economy which we VBP is approaching us . I do n’t VB the Left , it has no interest in the whole question because it is concerned about progress and development , to put it IN that . You VBP a critique of these technologies . I call it JJ alchemy , what we have now . But the Left is not interested in that and the other parties in any NN not at all as well . So , I do n’t VB who is VBG to be interested from the point of view of the parties . NNS are not informed and they do n’t VB informed , and NNS who speak about it are called NN theorists , etc . How to VB that to VB , the NN from believing in these ideologies from above in order to VB what is happening in reality ? How can NNS VB this ( ER : pictured with an employee of George Soros ) and the young NNS VB informed about the reality ? They should VB what is RB VBG on and not what is supposed to be VBG on . This is the problem . It is why I wrote the letter to Greta Thunberg , to VB her informed , and as I VBP she RB recognized ultimately that there is a JJ problem but not the NN we are discussing , that of ST : Did she answer you ? CvW : No , of course not . Because there is a JJ movement behind her , the CO2 movement is behind her , of course . There have been plans : 7 NNS ago , it was already being discussed how to mobilize the youth . This is not just a venture of the NNS but an organized campaign of the other side . ST : Claudia , we have to stop unfortunately , but we will present your book when it is VBG to come out and maybe we can present the book of Rosalie Bertell CD more NN because our task is to inform NNS . We do what we can to inform NNS . CvW : Maybe you can translate it for Italy and the Netherlands . ST : Yes , unfortunately , I have to stop but I thank you very much for being with us this evening and I hope to speak to you again .

This was demonstrated more than 40 NNS ago in a series of pioneering psychological experiments conducted in the Netherlands by Willem Wagenaar and his colleagues . In CD NN , participants were shown a hypothetical index of air pollution beginning in 1970 at a low value of 3 and rising yearly in an exponential NN to 7 , 20 , 55 and , finally , 148 by 1974 . Asked to intuitively predict the index value for 1979 , JJ of the respondents produced estimates at or below CD percent of the correct value of about 21,000 ( which can be determined from the underlying exponential equation ) . Subsequent experiments have observed similarly dramatic underestimation of exponential growth and showed that it typically results from straight - line projections VBN on early JJ increases . The deceptive nature of exponential growth is similarly conveyed by the riddle of a single lily pad in a pond . Suppose each member of this NN reproduces once a day so that on the second day there are CD lily pads , on the third day there are four , on the fourth day there are eight , etc . On Day 48 , the pond is covered completely . How RB did it take to be covered halfway ? The answer is 47 days . Moreover , RB after 40 days of exponential growth , you MD barely VB the lily pads are there , as they MD cover only 1/256th ( 0.4 percent ) of the pond at that NN . For a period of NN , we can easily ignore the steady exponential growth of lily pads — until they smother the pond . With respect to the NN , the initial doubling of the relatively JJ numbers of infected NNS and deaths evoked little concern outside NNP in January and most of February , since , for weeks , NNS IN the NN had little or no personal exposure to the NN or its victims . But the deceptively mild and seemingly faraway beginnings of the current NN led NN officials and governments to squander JJ opportunities for early intervention . As a result , in the past few weeks , the numbers have quickly become a torrent overwhelming our capacity to stop the NN ’ spread and care for the victims . It took 67 days to reach 100,000 NN NNS worldwide . The second 100,000 NNS took 11 days , and the third 100,000 took only four days . JJ - NN authorities are now scrambling to communicate just how steep and damaging the NN growth curve has or MD become , and urgent response is becoming the law of the land . Aside from the NN NN , the biggest , most destructive exponential growth processes that we must grapple with today are those associated with JJ NN NN . While it might be hard for NNS to detect that NN NNS and their concentration in the atmosphere are growing exponentially RB now , that does n’t mean we should rest easy . The opposite is JJ . As with the NN , we VBP to anticipate the NN NN and act quickly and aggressively to minimize further damages before they overwhelm us . NNS have RB recognized that NN dioxide NNS and their resulting effects have been increasing exponentially . Figure 1 shows the monthly average NN dioxide concentration measured at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii — the longest record of direct measurements of CO in the atmosphere . The volume of CO stood at 315 parts per CD ( ppm ) when RB measured in 1958 ; by the end of February 2020 , it had risen by 31 percent to 414 ppm ."

Blue Lake , CD of the largest lakes on North Stradbroke Island , southeast of Brisbane , has been the focus of research examining the lake ’s response to JJ NN over NN . Researchers studied the lake ’s NN discharge , NN quality and comparisons of historical photos over the past 117 NNS , as well as fossil pollen and algae to better understand its history over the past 7500 NNS . The results , published RB in the journal Freshwater Biology , show that Blue Lake has remained relatively stable and resilient for millennia . “ Blue Lake is CD of those rare , beautiful lakes in Australia . It ’s unusual because it ’s more than CD metres deep but it ’s so clear you can VB to the bottom , ” VBZ the lead author of the NN , Dr Cameron Barr from the NNP ’s Discipline of Geography , Environment and Population . “ We did n’t realize just how unique and unusual this lake is until we started looking at a wide range of JJ markers . “ We VBP that there have been variations in NN in the region including North Stradbroke Island over recent decades , but during that NN the depth , shoreline and NN chemistry of Blue Lake has displayed little variation . “ We RB VBP that the region experienced a significant shift towards a drier NN IN 4000 NNS ago . Again , Blue Lake has demonstrated little variation over this period . This is in stark contrast to other NNS in the region due to shifts in NN . “ It appears that Blue Lake has been an important NN ‘ refuge ’ for the freshwater biota of the region , and is in the same condition now as it was 7500 NNS ago . With appropriate management , the lake MD continue relatively unchanged for hundreds , possibly thousands of NNS to come , ” Dr Barr VBZ .

The demise of the NNP auto giant General Motors Corporation , by itself , is a catastrophic mark upon NNP , especially in light of its having armed and equipped the US NNP through CD NNP Wars , raised millions of citizens into the middle class and at its height employed nearly 350,000 workers in 150 assembly plants supporting over 2 CD others in associated parts plants , dealerships and banking . But , to the worst fate of the 101 - NN - old institution of JJ industrial might is that with its bankruptcy it has now fallen under the NN of the US NN in an JJ scheme VBN on a failed Marxist ideology that those few who are left that remember NNP in during her greatest hours VBP all too well spells the doom of their country . RB worse , today RB marks the day that the NNP NNPS is slamming shut its borders against all outsiders in what CD Canadian official stated was a “ heightened militarization ” of the US and will VB its citizens for the JJ NN in their history being forced to present NN identification passports to reenter their own country from their North JJ neighbors Canada and Mexico . As we have RB tried to warn these NNS of the catastrophic dangers facing them , the events we have foretold to them for NNS are now being set to be poured upon these hapless Americans , who RB while they cry in anguish at their demise , they can never VB they were n’t warned , only that they did n’t listen . And from our JJ reports over the NNS VBN on their own NN ’s dire predictions on any Nations ability to survive this century , the NN most ignored by these Americans is the chilling report from their own Pentagon that the London Observer published and VBZ in part : “ A secret report , suppressed by US defence chiefs and obtained by The Observer , warns that major European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a ' Siberian ' NN by 2020 . Nuclear conflict , mega - droughts , famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the NN . The document predicts that abrupt NN NN MD bring the NN to the edge of anarchy as NNS develop a nuclear threat to defend and secure dwindling food , NN and NN supplies . The threat to JJ stability vastly eclipses that of terrorism , VB the few experts privy to its contents . Disruption and conflict will be endemic features of NN , ' concludes the Pentagon analysis . “ Once again , warfare MD define JJ NN . ” Not surprisingly , the JJ NNS continue to ignore the facts that have led to the destruction of their Nation , and RB to this day they continue believing the lies heaped upon them by their celebrity driven propaganda NN , all the while never wondering what are the JJ reasons why over $ 25 Trillion of their personal savings and home values and all of the job gains for the past decade have been wiped out in less than six months . This cannot be VBN , however , of their elite classes and NN oligarchs , who RB as they watch their own fellow citizens plunge into the abyss of mass starvation , homelessness , anarchy and Total NNP NNP , they have set their Nation upon a course of confrontation with an entire NN just as desperate as they are to survive what can only be described as an apocalyptic future where who lives and who dies will be determined by violence , not cooperation . And , how far these JJ NNS have actually fallen is , perhaps , best summarized by the Russian writer Stanislav Mishin who recently wrote : “ RB , the population was dumbed down through a politicized and substandard education NN VBN on pop culture , rather then the classics . Americans VBP more about their favorite TV dramas then the drama in DC that directly affects their lives . They care more for their "" NN "" to choke down a McDonalds burger or a Burger King burger than for their constitutional rights . Then they turn RB and lecture us about our rights and about our "" democracy "" . Pride blind the foolish . Then their faith in NNP was destroyed , until their churches , all tens of thousands of JJ "" branches and denominations "" were for the most part little more then Sunday circuses and their televangelists and top protestant mega preachers were more then happy to sell out their souls and flocks to be on the "" winning "" side of CD pseudo Marxist politician or another . Their flocks MD complain , but when explained that they MD be on the "" winning "" side , their flocks were ever so quick to reject Christ in hopes for earthly NN . RB our Holy Orthodox churches are scandalously liberalized in NNP . The final collapse has come with the NN of Barack Obama . His speed in the past three months has been truly impressive . His spending and NN printing has been a record setting , not just in NNP 's short history but in the NN . If this keeps up for more then another NN , and there is no sign that it will not , NNP at best will resemble the Wiemar Republic and at worst Zimbabwe . These past CD weeks have been the most breath taking of all . RB came the announcement of a planned redesign of the JJ Byzantine tax NN , by the very thieves who VBD it to bankroll their thefts , loses and swindles of hundreds of billions of dollars . These make our Russian oligarchs look little more then ordinary street thugs , in comparison . Yes , the Americans have beat our own thieves in the shear volumes . Should we congratulate them ? ” It was once quipped on an JJ television show , “ George NNP had a vision for this country . Was it three days of uninterrupted shopping ? ” ; sadly this is what these once great NNS became , all the while living their lives never bothering to read what their great founding father had RB envisioned for them and warned them about … “ NN is not reason ; it is not eloquent ; it is force .

The nature of the NN for NN NN is explained , as are the principal mechanisms that have caused NN NN throughout the history of NNP . Finally , a detailed description is given of NN NN over JJ JJ timescales , ranging from a typical JJ NN span to all of geologic NN . For a detailed description of the development of NNP ’s atmosphere , VB the article atmosphere , evolution of . For full treatment of the most critical issue of NN NN in the contemporary NN , VB JJ NN . NN is often defined loosely as the average NN at a particular place , incorporating such features as NN , precipitation , humidity , and windiness . A more specific definition MD VB that NN is the mean NN and variability of these features over some extended NN period . Both definitions acknowledge that the NN is always changing , owing to instabilities in the atmosphere . And as NN varies from day to day , so too does NN vary , from daily day - and - night cycles up to periods of geologic NN hundreds of millions of NNS RB . In a very real sense , NN variation is a redundant expression — NN is always varying . No CD NNS are exactly alike , nor are any CD decades , any CD centuries , or any CD millennia . The atmosphere is a dynamic fluid that is continually in motion . Both its physical properties and its rate and direction of motion are influenced by a variety of factors , including solar radiation , the geographic position of continents , ocean currents , the location and orientation of mountain ranges , atmospheric chemistry , and vegetation growing on the land NN . All these factors VBP through NN . Some factors , such as the distribution of heat within the oceans , atmospheric chemistry , and NN vegetation , VB at very short timescales . Others , such as the position of continents and the location and height of mountain ranges , VBP over very JJ timescales . Therefore , NN , which results from the physical properties and motion of the atmosphere , varies at every conceivable timescale . A series of photographs of the Grinnell Glacier taken from the summit of Mount Gould in Glacier National Park , Montana , in 1938 , 1981 , 1998 , and 2006 ( from left to NN ) . In 1938 the Grinnell Glacier filled the entire area at the bottom of the image . By 2006 it had largely disappeared from this view . NN NN , periodic modification of NNP ’s NN brought about as a result of NNS in the atmosphere as well as interactions between the atmosphere and various other geologic , chemical , biological , and geographic factors within the NNP NN . The atmosphere is influenced by and linked to other features of NNP , including oceans , NN masses ( glaciers and NN NN ) , land surfaces , and vegetation . Together , they make up an integrated NNP NN , in which all components interact with and influence CD another in often complex ways . For instance , NN influences the distribution of vegetation on NNP ’s NN ( e.g. , deserts exist in arid regions , forests in humid regions ) , but vegetation in turn influences NN by reflecting radiant NN back into the atmosphere , transferring NN ( and latent heat ) from soil to the atmosphere , and influencing the horizontal movement of air across the land NN . • None iceberg Tourist boat in front of a massive iceberg near the coast of Greenland . • None Turkmenistan Drought - resistant plants grow in the Repetek Preserve in the southeastern Karakum Desert , Turkmenistan . NNP NNS and atmospheric NNS are still seeking a full understanding of the complex feedbacks and interactions among the various components of the NNP NN . This effort is being facilitated by the development of an interdisciplinary NN called NNP NN NN . NN NN NN is composed of a wide range of disciplines , including climatology ( the NN of the atmosphere ) , geology ( the NN of NNP ’s NN and underground processes ) , ecology ( the NN of how NNP ’s organisms relate to CD another and their environment ) , oceanography ( the NN of NNP ’s oceans ) , glaciology ( the NN of NNP ’s NN masses ) , and RB the JJ sciences ( the NN of JJ behaviour in its JJ and cultural aspects ) . A full understanding of the NNP NN requires NN of how the NN and its components have changed through NN . The pursuit of this understanding has led to development of NNP NN history , an interdisciplinary NN that includes not only the contributions of NNP NN NNS but RB paleontologists ( who VBP the NN of past geologic periods ) , paleoclimatologists ( who VBP past climates ) , paleoecologists ( who VBP past environments and ecosystems ) , paleoceanographers ( who VBP the history of the oceans ) , and other NNS concerned with NNP history . Because JJ components of the NNP NN VBP at JJ rates and are relevant at JJ timescales , NNP NN history is a diverse and complex NN . Students of NNP NN history are not just concerned with documenting what has happened ; they RB view the past as a series of experiments in which solar radiation , ocean currents , continental configurations , atmospheric chemistry , and other important features have varied . These experiments provide opportunities to learn the relative influences of and interactions between various components of the NNP NN . Studies of NNP NN history RB specify the full array of NNS the NN has experienced in the past and those the NN is capable of experiencing in the future . Undoubtedly , NNS have always been aware of climatic variation at the relatively short timescales of seasons , NNS , and decades . Biblical scripture and other early documents refer to droughts , floods , periods of severe cold , and other climatic events . Nevertheless , a full appreciation of the nature and magnitude of climatic NN did not come about until the late 18th and early 19th centuries , a NN when the widespread recognition of the deep antiquity of NNP occurred . Naturalists of this NN , including Scottish geologist Charles Lyell , Swiss - born naturalist and geologist Louis Agassiz , English naturalist Charles Darwin , JJ botanist Asa Gray , and Welsh naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace , came to recognize geologic and biogeographic NN that made sense only in the light of past climates radically JJ from those prevailing today . Geologists and paleontologists in the 19th and early 20th centuries uncovered NN of massive climatic NNS taking place before the Pleistocene — that is , before some 2.6 CD NNS ago . For example , red beds indicated aridity in regions that are now humid ( e.g. , England and NNP England ) , whereas fossils of coal - swamp plants and reef corals indicated that tropical climates once occurred at present - day high latitudes in both Europe and North NNP . Since the late 20th century the development of advanced technologies for dating rocks , together with geochemical techniques and other analytical tools , have revolutionized the understanding of early NNP NN history . The occurrence of multiple epochs in recent NNP history during which continental glaciers , developed at high latitudes , penetrated into northern Europe and eastern North NNP was recognized by NNS by the late 19th century . Scottish geologist James Croll proposed that recurring variations in orbital eccentricity ( the deviation of NNP ’s orbit from a perfectly circular path ) were responsible for alternating glacial and interglacial periods . Croll ’s controversial idea was taken up by Serbian mathematician and astronomer Milutin Milankovitch in the early 20th century . Milankovitch proposed that the mechanism that brought about periods of glaciation was driven by cyclic NNS in eccentricity as well as CD other orbital parameters : precession ( a NN in the directional focus of NNP ’s axis of rotation ) and axial tilt ( a NN in the inclination of NNP ’s axis with respect to the plane of its orbit IN the NNP ) . Orbital variation is now recognized as an important driver of climatic variation throughout NNP ’s history ( VB below Orbital [ Milankovitch ] variations ) ."

In short , they have disguised their JJ depopulation scheme as being a necessary NN in the effort to fight NN NN . “ Here ’s a provocative thought : Maybe we should protect our kids by not having them , ” VBZ Rieder . Provocative indeed , but the scheme ( at least in its JJ stage ) is being candy - coated to make it sound more palatable to the average citizen . The depopulation birth tax MD apply more heavily to the rich , while encouraging the poor to use more birth NN , according to Rieder and his colleagues , who VBP that the plan will not be as “ abusive ” as NNP ’s CD - NN policy . “ It aims to persuade NNS to choose fewer NNS with a strategy that boils down to carrots for the poor , sticks for the rich . “ Ethically , Rieder VBZ poor nations VBP some slack because they ’re still developing , and because their per capita NNS are a sliver of the developed NN ’s . Plus , it just does n’t look good for rich , Western nations to tell NNS in poor ones not to have kids . ” Of course , the rich can afford a “ childbirth tax , ” while the rest of us non-elites will be the ones forced to abandon having NNS to comply with the depopulation scheme . Rieder claims that by reducing worldwide childbirth rates by “ half a NN per woman , ” NN NNS MD be reduced by as much as CD - quarter of the amount needed to avoid the “ tipping point ” that will lead to 4 degrees Celsius JJ NN by the end of the century – a level of NN that will ostensibly make the NN “ largely uninhabitable for NNS . ” His plan has created plenty of controversy already ; Rieder receives “ nasty comments ” RB , and has raised the ire of NN NN skeptics such as Marc Morano of NNP Depot . “ The warmists have now graduated from regulating our light bulbs , coal plants and SUVs to regulating our family size , ” VBD Morano . “ Let ’s keep ‘ JJ NN ’ out of the bedroom ! ” As radical as Rieder ’s proposals MD sound , there are those among the NN NN activists who are calling for RB more drastic measures . According to the Sierra Club : “ Childbearing [ should be ] a punishable crime against society , unless the NNS hold a NN license . ” RB more extreme is the stance of the Voluntary NNP Extinction Movement , whose members maintain that “ voluntary JJ extinction is the humanitarian alternative to JJ disasters , ” and that NNS should commit “ NN suicide ” to save the environment . The hidden agenda is no longer hidden And so it appears that the gloves are now off , as the JJ elites have begun to VB JJ with their depopulation plans . These self - appointed saviors apparently envision a NN in which they alone will enjoy the benefits of a reduced population , while the rabble are encouraged – or outright coerced – into non-reproduction . Who gave them the NN to make these decisions ? The answer is that we did – or at least JJ of us did – by allowing ourselves to be duped by fearmongers IN NNP Gore and others bent on selling the so that the elite MD take over the NN and fashion it into something that serves their interests . We VBP to understand that the issue is not NN NN at all ; the real agenda is creating a NN where you and I and our NNS ’s NNS will no longer be allowed to exist . Our very is now being threatened by the JJ elite – if we let them carry out their plans ."

Students at Wisconsin learn under Dr. Jonathan Patz , who had already been consulting for the NNP Nations on accelerating man-made NN NN ’s NN impacts decades ago . The students examine , for instance , heat - related mortality , as well as the healthy “ upside ” of adapting to the effects of NN NN . Reducing PRP ’s reliance on cars and eating smarter benefits the JJ body and Mother NNP alike , Patz argues . Wisconsin is just CD of roughly CD dozen JJ schools leading — although only typically by offering a few courses — in the training of physicians , nurses , pharmacists and other practitioners who will take to the front lines of diagnosing and treating the impact of NN NN . That impact is showing up increasingly in emergencies , such as wildfires , and in complicated - pregnancy statistics RB in developed nations . More broadly , the spread of toxins , asthma NNS , cardiovascular NN and Lyme NN is on the rise , all part of what The Lancet has deemed the biggest JJ NN threat of the 21st century . Yet the slow drip of JJ or amended JJ - school programs that address NN NN must be accelerated , some experts stress . Their efforts got an important boost after the NNP NNP Association in 2019 gave its backing to expanding NN - NN training . “ NN NN is our reality . It is VBG to VB the NN we provide clinical care . For that reason , it needs to be taught in every JJ school across the nation , ” VBD Dr. Ashish Jha , the K.T. Li Professor of NNP NNP and NNP Policy at Harvard ’s T.H. Chan School of NNP NNP , writing in the Journal of the NNP NNP Association . So far , NN - related scholarship has emerged in the last few NNS via elective courses and CD - off lectures rather than treated as a portion of core curriculum , according to a NN published in 2018 in the journal Academic Medicine . Those researchers VBD that a database was created but is lacking comprehensive reporting by schools of what NN - NN lessons are taught . The lingering challenge : JJ schools VBP they can’t devote significant attention to NN NN in an already packed curriculum . The NN burden MD be eased via shared materials . Columbia NNP ’s Mailman School of NNP NNP formed the NNP Consortium on NNP and NNP Education in 2017 to begin to share ideas on how to train NN professionals . To date , it can count some 180 signatories of mostly JJ - NN programs , but RB over 20 JJ schools and another CD dozen nursing programs . RB without dedicated coursework , existing classes should include more NN - NN teaching , VB proponents . For instance , an asthma - diagnosing exercise with questions more closely tied to pollution exposure has now been in practice at the NNP of Illinois College of Medicine at Urbana - Champaign and is driving curriculum priorities at the NNP of California , San Francisco , near where deadly fires raged over the last couple of NNS . Air pollution is responsible for about seven CD deaths a NN worldwide , according to the NNP NNP Organization , which VBD that reducing the burning of fossil fuels MD avoid 2.5 CD premature deaths each NN by 2050 . Pollen and other aeroallergen levels are RB higher in extreme heat . These factors can trigger asthma , which affects RB 300 CD NNS but can usually be treated . Physicians RB VBP better training in screening for vector - borne illnesses ( infectious pathogens spread from CD living organism to another ; VB ticks or mosquitoes ) which are expected to increase with higher NNS . Diagnosed NNS of tick - spread Lyme NN , for instance , doubled between 2004 and CD , according to the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention . Mosquitoes are cold - blooded vectors of NN , so any mosquito - borne NN will be affected by very JJ NNS in NN . JJ NNS RB affect respiratory NN , cardiovascular NN and cerebrovascular mortality or stroke , VBD Harvard ’s Jha . Globally , the JJ profession RB has a stake in policy IN access to clean drinking NN and fighting nutrient depletion in crops and food from NN effects . The benefits of the work under NN at UC , San Francisco , part of a broader statewide NN , is that JJ practices might be implemented throughout its several hospitals , clinics and classrooms , and much of the JJ training is geared toward layering on to existing course work . For instance , it ’s important for JJ students to understand the effects that hotter NNS can have on the effectiveness and risks of pharmaceuticals , such as antipsychotics and diuretics , VBD UCSF ’s Dr. Sheri Weiser , an epidemiologist and practicing internist at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital , who RB holds a master ’s degree in JJ NN . Arianne Teherani , Ph.D. , a professor of medicine and education at UCSF , VBZ JJ training in NN awareness is n’t just about diagnostics but fully understanding the role of medicine in creating and fixing the effects of NN NN . If the U.S. NN - care NN were a country , it MD rank 13th in the NN for NN gas NNS , the article in Academic Medicine cites . Professors of anesthesia , radiology and pharmacy , for example , are encouraged to teach that anesthetic gases , imaging technologies and pharmaceuticals all have a significant NN footprint that MD VB to be offset , at the least , with green best - practices elsewhere , such as a shift to more NN efficiency in hospitals and offices . More work is needed , Teherani VBZ , in cutting the industry ’s footprint overall . There ’s RB mental NN to consider . Sobering NN - NN statistics , no matter their projected NN for realization , are already having an impact . Dr. Karla Ivankovich , Ph.D. , a licensed clinical professional counselor and professor of psychology at the NNP of Illinois at Springfield , VBD the mental - NN profession has seen growing JJ anxiety from a widening trench of partisanship carry over into NN - VB dread , and JJ therapists MD welcome additional training . Ivankovich VBD that she and other therapists are seeing patients who , among other concerns , find themselves troubled by the choice to have NNS more than past clients had , which Ivankovich linked in part to their fears for NN NN and their response to the pickup in NN coverage . Not all who wear the white coat VBP that addressing NN NN in the exam room is JJ to the profession ’s intent . “ The zeitgeist of sociology and JJ work have become the driving force in JJ education . The goal of today ’s educators is to produce legions of primary care physicians who engage in what is termed ‘ population NN . ’ This fits perfectly with the current administrator - rich , policy - heavy , form - over - function approach at every level of JJ education , ” wrote Dr. Stanley Goldfarb , a JJ associate dean of curriculum at the NNP of Pennsylvania ’s Perelman School of Medicine , in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal . “ Meanwhile , oncologists , cardiologists , surgeons and other JJ specialists are in short supply . ” Jha , writing in JAMA , MD argue that view neglects both the NN warning signs and the NN medicine should evolve . “ With the ubiquitous presence of NN technology , including clinical decision support tools , students and physicians now have ready access to all the JJ NN ever created … [ JJ JJ schools ] still spend too much NN teaching topics such as laboratory methods and having students memorize anatomic details that can be covered more quickly or not at all , ” he VBZ NN professionals operating as a gatekeeper for NN - NN risks is effective , argues Dr. Courtney Howard , an emergency physician in Canada ’s subarctic Yellowknife , Northwest Territories , where the changing conditions VBP major NN NNS for her native patients in particular . Howard routinely argues , including in this TEDx talk , that the trust JJ professionals tend to cultivate with patients positions them to best teach about NN - NN impacts ; she cites survey statistics showing nurses routinely rank at the top of a list of professionals that NNS trust , with doctors in second place and politicians in dead last . “ We all have pull and we VBP to use it ” to combat NN NN , Howard regularly tells NN professionals . If Wisconsin ’s Patz has his NN , the future of NN curriculum will break slightly with med - school norms , equipping doctors and nurses to better engage with experts outside of the NN - care setting . That includes urban planners , civil and JJ engineers , and of course , JJ - NN officials . Treatment and advocacy should never be separate pursuits , he argues ."

Now , designers in Indonesia have offered up what MD be the most audacious plan yet : they propose building NN - making submarines that MD ply polar waters and pop out icebergs to replace melting floes . “ NN level rise due to melting NN should not only be responded [ to ] with defensive solutions , ” the designers of the submersible iceberg factory VBD in an animated NN describing the vessel , which took second place in a recent design competition held by the Association of Siamese Architects . The NN shows the proposed submarine dipping slowly beneath the ocean NN to allow seawater to fill its JJ hexagonal well . When the vessel surfaces , an onboard desalination NN removes the salt from the NN and a “ giant freezing machine ” and chilly ambient NNS freeze the fresh NN to create the six - sided bergs . These float away when the vessel resubmerges and starts the process all over again . A fleet of the NN - making subs , operating continuously , MD create enough of the 25 - meter - wide “ NN babies ” to make a larger NN sheet , according to the designers . Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha , an architect in Jakarta and the leader of the project , VBD he sees the design as a complement to ongoing efforts to curb NNS . “ To stop JJ NN , of course we still have to reduce NN NNS throughout the NN , ” he VBD in a message , adding that he advocated a CD - pronged approach to curbing NN NN : reduce NN NNS on CD hand and rebuild lost NN on the other . Experts praised the designers ' vision but cast doubt on the project 's feasibility . “ It ’s IN trying to save the sand castle you built at the beach VBG a dixie cup as the tide comes in , ” Michael Mann , a professor of atmospheric sciences at Penn NNP , VBD of the iceberg - making proposal . Mark Serreze , director of the NNP of Colorado ’s National Snow and NNP NNP Center in Boulder , offered a similar assessment . He called the project “ very interesting ” but VBD it raised more questions than it answered . “ What are you VBG to do , put out a flotilla of 10,000 submarines ? ” he VBD . “ Who ’s VBG to build them and how much NN does it take , and how are the submarines powered ? ” And unless they ’re powered by wind or another clean NN source , he added , the submarines MD VB to burn fossil fuels , releasing RB more NN - VBG NN gases into the air . If the icebergs were JJ enough , they might VB curb NN level rise indirectly by reflecting more of the solar radiation that raises JJ NNS . But Serreze VBD creating the bergs MD n’t lower NN levels directly if they remained in the NN ; they'd have to wind up on land to reduce the volume of the oceans . More important , Serreze VBD , rebuilding NN NN MD do nothing to address the NN gas NNS that are the root NN of NN NN . “ It ’s simply a Band - Aid , ” he VBD of the NN - making vessel idea . Serreze voiced similar concerns about other recent proposals for geoengineering the environment to mitigate the effects of NN NN , including everything from spraying sunlight - blocking aerosols into the atmosphere to deploying millions of wind - powered pumps to spread seawater over the NN 's northernmost reaches . Such plans are often not feasible , he VBD , and they MD have unintended consequences that compound our JJ problems . For example , he VBD , the spraying of aerosols in CD region MD lead to droughts in another . Nevertheless , he called geoengineering an important tool in the ongoing fight against NN NN — but CD that should be considered a last resort . “ There has been a lot of work on geoengineering , and it should continue , ” he VBD . “ We never VBP to VB in that direction . But if it ’s a last gasp , then you try it . ” • Immense crater MD have been VBN deep under Greenland 's NN sheet • This floating city concept is CD NN to cope with NN NN Follow NBC NNP MACH on NNP and NNP and Instagram ."

"" Our analysis suggests that , in addition to beneficial effects on morbidity , mortality and NN care costs , managing obesity can favorably affect the environment as well , "" VBD NN corresponding author Faidon Magkos , from the department of nutrition , exercise and sports at the NNP of Copenhagen , in Denmark . IN other oxygen - dependent creatures , NNS emit NN dioxide that 's produced by metabolic processes necessary to live , the NNS explained . The amount of NN dioxide -- a NN gas -- produced by a NN is determined by its average metabolic rate , average body size and the total number of individuals of the NN . Obese NNS produce more NN dioxide than those of normal weight , the researchers VBD . RB , obese NNS consume greater quantities of food and beverages that VBP to be produced and transported to them , and transportation of obese NNS requires more consumption of fossil fuels . This means higher NN dioxide NNS related to food production and transportation for obese NNS , the NN authors explained . The researchers estimated that obesity contributes to an extra 700 megatons of NN dioxide NNS per NN worldwide , or about 1.6 % of all JJ - caused NNS . Overall , being obese is associated with about 20 % more NN gas NNS ( NN dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide ) than being a normal weight , according to the NN published RB Dec. 20 in the journal Obesity . "" This has important implications for all those involved in the management of obesity , "" Magkos added in a journal NN release . The researchers stressed that these findings should not lead to more stigmatization for obese NNS , who already face negative attitudes and discrimination . Ted Kyle is founder of ConscienHealth , an organization that works to find sound approaches to NN and obesity . "" This NN makes it clear that we pay a steep NN for making it difficult to access care for obesity .

E&E_NNP provides_VBZ daily_JJ coverage_NN of_IN essential_JJ energy_NN and_CC environmental_JJ news_NN at_IN www.eenews.net._ADD","The White NNP laid out its policy priorities for a second NNP term yesterday , and NN NN was n’t on the agenda . In fact , the word “ NN ” did n’t appear at all in the 138 - page main budget document , which asked Congress for a total of $ 4.8 trillion to fund the NN ’s priorities across the federal NN in fiscal 2021 . That figure MD mean a slight increase in federal spending overall compared with the status quo and MD enable the NNP administration to grow the NN to include the U.S. NNP Force and to fund favorite infrastructure projects IN the border wall . But the agencies that are most responsible for addressing NN NN at home and abroad — including EPA and the departments of NNP and NNP — MD VB steep cuts under the proposal . And programs within those agencies that deal directly with NN NN MD take the biggest hit . Congress , however , is almost certain to reject the budget blueprint as is . For CD thing , it violates a bipartisan agreement on spending that Congress reached last summer . In addition — RB before Democrats gained NN of the NNP — Congress routinely MD override NNP ’s efforts to slash funding for NN - related items such as EPA grants to NNS and DOE ’s Advanced Research Projects Agency - NNP , a research and development program . And this NN Congress is likely to finish funding the federal NN after November ’s presidential NN . The result likely will weigh heavily on the appropriations process . But the budget document does provide a sneak peek of what NNP MD VB to do with a second term , including an extension to the 2017 tax cuts and continued efforts toward deregulation . And it includes his reelection pitch to voters — insomuch that it argues that his pro-business policies have resulted in a “ blue - collar ” JJ boom that has benefited workers , especially those in the NN sector . In the budget proposal , as in last week ’s NN of the Union address , NNP celebrated the NNP NNPS ’ arrival as a major oil and gas producer that ’s set in 2020 to be a net petroleum exporter . The shift began under NNP Obama , but NNP claimed credit for himself and his deregulatory policies . “ More jobs , lower costs , and JJ dominance — these are predictable results of our pro-energy policies , ” NNP wrote in his budget request . EPA , which is celebrating half a century of existence this NN , MD receive $ 6.7 CD for fiscal 2021 — a 27 % cut compared with enacted levels . It RB MD slash its workforce by about 11 % , to the lowest levels since 1985 . The administration stressed in the budget and its supporting documents that this NN MD return EPA to its “ core mission ” of protecting “ clean air , land and NN , and ensuring chemical safety , while targeting emerging domestic and JJ JJ challenges . ” It ’s unclear whether the last part of that line is a veiled reference to NN NN , but the issue is n’t mentioned by name in the EPA section of the main budget document . In an informal summary provided by EPA , it appears six times — mainly in the titles of programs slated for elimination . EPA tangled with California last NN over the NN ’s struggle to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards . The budget asks Congress for a total of $ 437 CD for EPA ’s air quality work overall , down from the current funding level of $ 813 CD . That includes reduced budgets for enforcement , NN and technology , and other programs . The air and NN research program , which supports future regulations , MD lose CD - thirds of its budget — a sign that EPA under NNP is n’t contemplating JJ JJ regulatory actions . The budget request RB MD cut funding to implement the Montreal Protocol , a globally popular ozone treaty that ’s now RB phasing down hydrofluorocarbons — a powerful class of NN gases VBN in cooling and refrigeration . While there ’s scant mention of NN NN in EPA ’s budget , the issue does appear in a section on “ wasteful "" spending items at EPA that the NNP administration has recommended for the chopping block . The budget again proposes moving the NNP Star NN efficiency program — which is jointly administered by EPA and DOE — to a user - fee model that Congress previously has rejected . The same section RB floated plans to zero out funding for several EPA NN NN partnership programs including the Coalbed Methane Outreach Program , the NNP Methane Initiative and Natural Gas STAR . “ These programs are not essential to EPA ’s core mission and can be implemented by the private sector , ” it VBZ . Sean Alcorn , a legislative analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council , VBD the proposal to cut full - NN EPA staff from 14,172 positions to 12,610 MD VB rid of expertise at the agency — a move that MD pay dividends for NNP ’s anti-regulatory agenda RB if he does n’t win in November . “ This is trying to eviscerate the NN store that we have for future administrations , ” he VBD . “ It ’s setting EPA up to fail in future NNS . ” The fiscal 2021 budget justification for the NNP Department includes CD fleeting reference to NN NN as an issue , IN armed conflict and poverty , that is best solved through multilateral channels . But the NNP administration again proposes steep cuts to the top diplomatic agency of more than 21 % to $ 40.8 CD , down from $ 53 CD enacted for fiscal 2020 . The scope of the cuts is difficult to gauge because the proposal eliminates some budget lines and combines others . But observers VBP the result MD be deep reductions in U.S. support for multilateral and bilateral partnerships on the environment , renewable NN , NN , sustainable landscapes , forestry and other issues . Capitol Hill generally has rejected those moves and seems likely to do so again . In the last CD NNS , Congress has rejected NNP administration efforts to halve support for the JJ Environment Facility , which funds projects in developing NNS . The NNP NNPS remains a top contributor to the fund despite efforts by the NNP administration to zero out funding for fiscal 2020 . “ I VBP the message to the vulnerable NNS that VBP support from the GEF and from other funds is to pay attention to what gets into the final appropriations NN and not what is VBN in these requests , because they are messaging documents , ” VBD Joe Thwaites , who follows NN finance for the NNP Resources Institute . But funding for the NNP Nations ’ high - profile Green NNP Fund is unlikely to be restored while NNP is in office . The fund has been a target for GOP lawmakers who have resisted NNP ’s suggested cuts to other diplomatic budget lines . NNP ’s budget request proposes major cuts to disaster - response agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers . But Congress previously has overridden similar proposals . A cut of $ 1.7 CD in Army Corps funding , to $ 6 CD next NN , MD reduce the agency ’s spending on flood NN — but that is unlikely to be sustained . The administration wants to eliminate funding “ for projects that are better suited to be carried out by NNS and local communities . ” But Congress has given the Army Corps more NN than administrations have requested since at least 2006 and has funneled increasing amounts in the past three NNS as intense flooding has damaged levees , according to the Congressional Research Service . The administration is renewing its effort to eliminate a $ CD CD FEMA program , enacted in the final month of the Obama administration , that helps communities pay for repairs to “ high - hazard ” dams whose failure MD result in loss of NN . Such projects are “ better suited to be carried out by NNS and local communities , ” the administration VBZ in its budget proposal . Congress repeatedly has restored the funding . The administration RB is trying again to cut FEMA ’s flood - mapping budget to $ 100 CD from $ 263 CD , saying that mapping the nation ’s floodplains “ is not solely a federal responsibility . ” Congress has blocked each attempted budget cut . The administration MD find agreement with Congress in overhauling a much - maligned disaster recovery program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development . Congress has given HUD $ 40 CD in emergency funding since 2017 to VB communities rebuild from major disasters such as Hurricanes Harvey , Irma and Maria in 2017 . But funding has been mired in huge delays because federal law requires HUD to undertake a JJ and detailed rulemaking process before it can release the NN . Congressional leaders from both parties — as well as advocates — are looking to revamp HUD ’s disaster - recovery program so NN can be allocated more quickly . The administration VBZ in its budget proposal that it “ seeks to work with the Congress to comprehensively reform and redesign ” the HUD program , which it calls “ slow , unpredictable , and wasteful . ” The administration wants to eliminate funding for a NNP program that is developing an observatory to monitor NNP to better understand NN NN . NNP ’s NNP Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory MD produce “ highly accurate and trusted NN records ” that can VB produce policies on mitigation and NN “ that address the effects of NN NN on society , ” NNP VBZ . The observatory is scheduled to launch in 2023 . The administration acknowledges the observatory “ MD provide additional capabilities over existing satellites ” but VBZ the project “ is a lower priority compared to other NNP programs . ” The administration ’s budget boosts funding for missions to land astronauts on the NN and Mars . The NNP Department MD VB a cut of 8 % compared with 2020 enacted levels , to $ 38.5 CD . DOE ’s Advanced Research Projects Agency - NNP is again proposed for elimination , but Congress previously has shown no willingness to kill the popular research and development program . The Interior Department MD VB its budget reduced 13 % for fiscal 2021 , to $ 12.8 CD . NNP Democrats have accused the NNP administration of withholding funds from the U.S. Geological Survey ’s NNP NNP NNP Centers at Interior , which operate as partnerships with universities . Rep. Betty McCollum ( D - Minn. ) , chairwoman of the Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee , pressed the matter during testimony from USGS Director James Reilly . Reilly claimed ignorance during the April hearing . Afterward , documents obtained through the Freedom of NNP Act showed NNP administration staffers were working to heed McCollum ’s warning . “ Congress will pay attention to the implementation of this funding , ” according to a June meeting agenda for high - level staffers of USGS , Interior ’s assistant secretary for NN and NN , and the Bureau of Reclamation .

In the run-up to the meeting , EU leaders have cranked up the rhetoric about the NN for tough NN to tackle JJ NN , although some environmentalists VBP that proposed targets do not VB far enough . German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who will host European leaders for the JJ NN under Germany 's EU presidency , stressed the urgency of their task by warning that Europe was at an "" important crossroads . "" "" If we act decisively now , we have a chance of effectively counteracting the dangers of NN NN , "" she VBD in her invitation to the summit . Merkel VBD the British Financial Times newspaper on Wednesday that she wanted "" Europe to take a ' pioneering lead ' on meaningful green initiatives . "" Merkel was seconded by JJ US Vice NNP , NNP Gore who recently picked up an Oscar for his documentary on the ravages of JJ NN . Speaking to reporters on a visit to Brussels to address a conference on biofuels , Gore VBD a European lead on the issue was vital . "" I 'm trying to VB my country to VB its policies , but in the meantime the European Union is absolutely key to helping the NN make the NN it must , "" he VBD . British Prime Minister Tony Blair VBD that Europe should not only show leadership on combating NN NN , but RB beef up the security of NN supplies while opening the NN to more competition . "" I VBP there is the real possibility of showing how Europe can lead the debate on NN NN , on NN security , and on deregulation in the interest of a more competitive European economy , "" Blair VBD on Tuesday in London . EU leaders are expected to endorse plans to cut NN dioxide ( CO2 ) NNS by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels , and by 30 percent if other developed and emerging economies , particularly NNP and India , join them . The European Union produces about 14 percent of the NN 's NN gas NNS while the NNP NNPS , the NN 's largest polluter , produces some 25 percent . Although the summit is expected to provide a show of unity , tensions are brewing under the NN over the role of nuclear NN and the use of renewable NN sources . CD of the liveliest debates is expected on whether to set a binding target of renewable NN sources meeting 20 percent of Europe 's NN needs by 2020 , after foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on Monday . Environmentalists : "" It 's not enough "" Although Europe is leading efforts to combat NN NN , some environmentalists warned that the EU leaders are not aiming high enough . "" The EU 's NN NN plan ... will fall a JJ NN short in making Europe 's NN more sustainable unless targets for both renewable share and reducing NN gases are raised and tightened , "" VBD Friends of the NNP NN campaigner Jan Kowalzig . NN policy has climbed to the top of the EU JJ agenda over the last NN as oil NN spikes and cuts in gas and oil supplies from NNP have spurred the bloc to forge a common strategy to meeting their needs . However , despite the growing importance attached to NN , the EU has struggled to hammer out a common approach , with member NNS often putting national interests RB , much to the frustration of the European Commission . Such is the NN with a European Commission idea to inject greater competition into the EU NN NN with plans to make JJ , integrated gas and NN NNS split their generating and distribution networks . Leaders are likely to send the plan back to the drawing board with France and to a lesser extent Germany opposed to the idea , which MD VB a major shake - up of French and German NN groups . The summit comes amid a shifting European JJ landscape with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi emerging shaken from a recent NN , British Prime Minister Tony Blair increasingly a lame duck , and looming French presidential elections in April and NNP . It will RB be French NNP Jacques Chirac 's last chance to leave his mark on EU policy - making after nearly 12 NNS in office fiercely defending French interests during meetings with EU leaders . Looking ahead as Germany chairs the Group of Eight industrial nations this NN , Merkel will likely VB to take the conclusions of this week 's meetings into the G8 summit in Heiligendamm , Germany in June ."

"" This reality is being ignored by governments IN the NN , "" VBD James Hansen , who famously announced to the US Congress 30 NNS ago that JJ NN was underway . "" To VB that we are ' moving in the JJ direction ' just is n't good enough anymore , "" he VBD in an interview . Head of NNP 's Goddard Institute for NNP Studies until 2013 , Hansen and his 18 - NN - old granddaughter -- who is suing the US NN for contributing to the problem -- delivered that message this week at UN NN negotiations in Bonn . Thousands of diplomats at the 12 - day , 196 - nation talks are haggling over the fine print of a "" user 's manual "" for a treaty that will VB into effect in 2020 . Inked in the French capital in 2015 , the Paris Agreement calls for capping JJ NN at CD degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) . With the NN out of kilter after only CD degree of NN -- enough to amplify deadly heatwaves , superstorms and droughts -- the treaty RB vows to explore the feasibility of holding the line at 1.5 C . "" That is a good impulse , because if we VBP to 2 C , it is guaranteed that we will lose our shorelines and coastal cities , "" VBD Hansen . "" The only question is how fast . "" NNP 's NN NN , the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere , and NN levels have all changed in lock - step over hundreds of millions of NNS , he pointed out . In CD , atmospheric concentration of NN dioxide -- the main NN gas -- tipped over 403 parts per CD ( ppm ) , 40 percent above the pre-industrial average and the highest level in at least 800,000 NNS , the UN's NN agency reported this week . RB under optimistic scenarios , that number is projected to rise for decades . The UN's NN advisory body , the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) , has VBN we can "" likely "" stay under the 2 C threshold if CO2 levels do n't exceed 450 ppm by 2100 . For Hansen , that 's a recipe for disaster . Meltwater from the Greenland and Antarctic NN sheets MD add metres to NN levels by 2100 , he has calculated . "" The last NN in NNP 's history that CO2 concentrations were at 450 ppm , NN level was 25 metres ( 80 NNS ) higher , "" he noted . When writer and environmentalist NNP McKibben decided a decade ago to launch a campaign to fight JJ NN , he asked the NN 's best VBN NN scientist what he should call it . "" He had in NN the name ' 450.org ' , "" Hansen recalled . By coincidence , Hansen was about to publish a major NN that concluded the ceiling for CO2 levels should be 350 ppm , at most . Thus was born 350.org , probably the largest grassroots NN NN organisation in the NN . "" Hansen does make a compelling NN that JJ NN NN impacts are occurring sooner and with greater magnitude than we expected , "" VBD Michael Mann , director of the NNP NNP NNP Center at Pennsylvania NNP NNP . "" Jim 's past predictions have proven prescient and we do indeed ignore him at our peril . "" "" Hansen 's contributions to the basic NN of NN NN are fundamental to our current understanding -- no NN has contributed more , "" VBD Michael Oppenheimer , a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton NNP . RB if humanity succeeds in bending down the curve of NN NNS far sooner than currently seems imaginable , it MD not be fast enough to bring CO2 levels back to 350 ppm by century 's end , according to Hansen . "" You MD have to extract 150 CD tonnes of NN from the atmosphere , "" more than CD times the amount we emit each NN , he VBD . The technology to do that does not currently exist . At 76 , Hansen is thinking a lot about and what kind of NN young NNS will be inheriting . So is his granddaughter , Sophie Kivlehan , a JJ NN NN student in the NNP NNPS . Along with 20 of her peers , Kivlehan has sued the US federal NN for what might best be called NN negligence . "" When the US Constitution VBZ ' We the NNPS , ' that means young NNS too , "" she VBD in an interview . "" We have constitutional rights , and those rights are being violated . "" The NN is currently wending its NN through the federal NN NN , and MD CD day wind up before the Supreme NNP , CD of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs VBD AFP . NN attempts to have the NN thrown out have failed . Despite his grim predictions , Hansen has not thrown his hands up in despair . He continues , for example , to campaign for a direct tax on fossil fuels as the only realistic NN to achieve the necessary cuts ."

Until recently , natural factors have been the NN of these NNS . Natural influences on the NN include volcanic eruptions , NNS in the orbit of the NNP , and shifts in the NNP 's crust ( VBN as plate tectonics ) . Over the past CD CD NNS , the NNP has experienced a series of NN - ages ( ' glacial periods ' ) and warmer periods ( ' interglacial ' ) . Glacial and interglacial periods cycle roughly every 100,000 NNS , caused by NNS in NNP 's orbit IN the NN . For the past few thousand NNS , NNP has been in an interglacial period with a constant NN . However , since the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s , the JJ NN has increased at a much faster rate . By burning fossil fuels and changing how we use the land , JJ activity has quickly become the leading NN of NNS to our NN . How does the NN NN work ? Some gases in the NNP 's atmosphere trap heat and stop it escaping into NN . We call these ' NN gases ' . These gases act as a VBG blanket IN the NNP , VBN as the ' NN effect ' . NN gases come from both JJ and natural sources . Gases IN NN dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide naturally occur in the atmosphere . Others , such as chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) , are only produced by JJ activity . When short - wave radiation from the NN reaches NNP , most of it passes straight through and hits the NN . The NNP absorbs most of this radiation and gives off longer - wavelength infrared radiation . The NN gases absorb some of this infrared radiation , instead of it passing straight out into NN . The atmosphere then emits radiation in all directions , sending some of it back to the NN , causing the NN to heat up . This process is VBN as the ' NN effect ' . The NN effect is critical to our survival . In fact , without NN gases , NNP MD be about 30 degrees colder than it is today . Without NN gases and their NN effect , we MD n't be able to survive . However , since the Industrial Revolution , we 've been adding more and more NN gases into the air , trapping RB more heat . Instead of keeping NNP at a warm , stable NN , the NN effect is heating the NN at a much faster rate . We call this the ' enhanced NN effect ' and it's the main NN of NN NN . NNS VBP NN NN by releasing NN dioxide and other NN gases into the air . Today , there is more NN dioxide in the atmosphere than there ever has been in at least the past 800,000 NNS . During the 20th and 21st century , the level of NN dioxide rose by 40 % . We produce NN gases in lots of JJ ways : • Burning fossil fuels – Fossil fuels such as oil , gas , and coal contain NN dioxide that has been ' locked away ' in the ground for thousands of NNS . When we take these out of the land and burn them , we release the stored NN dioxide into the air . • Deforestation – Forests remove and store NN dioxide from the atmosphere . Cutting them down means that NN dioxide builds up quicker since there are no trees to absorb it . Not only that , trees release the NN they stored when we burn them . • Agriculture – Planting crops and rearing animals releases JJ JJ types of NN gases into the air . For example , animals produce methane , which is 30 times more powerful than NN dioxide as a NN gas . The nitrous oxide VBN for fertilisers is ten times worse and is nearly 300 times more potent than NN dioxide ! • Cement – Producing cement is another contributor to NN NN , causing 2 % of our entire NN dioxide NNS . Natural NNS to the NN The leading NN of NN NN is JJ activity and the release of NN gases . However , there are lots of natural causes that RB lead to NNS in the NN NN . Natural cycles can VB the NN to alternate between NN and cooling . There are RB natural factors that force the NN to VB , VBN as ' forcings ' . RB though these natural causes contribute to NN NN , we VBP that they are not the primary NN , VBN on scientific NN . Some of these natural cycles include : • Milankovitch cycles – As NNP travels IN the NN , its path and the tilt of its axis can VB slightly . These NNS , called Milankovitch cycles , affect the amount of sunlight that falls on NNP . This can VB the NN of NNP to VB . However , these cycles take place over tens or hundreds of thousands of NNS and are unlikely to be causing the NNS to the NN that we are seeing today . • El Niño Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) – ENSO is a pattern of changing NN NNS in the Pacific Ocean . In an ' El Niño ' NN , the JJ NN warms up , and in a ' La Niña ' NN , it cools down . These patterns can affect the JJ NN for a short amount of NN ( months or NNS ) but cannot explain the persistent NN that we VBP today . What is El Niño , what does it mean and how does it affect NN IN the NN ? Natural forcings that can contribute to NN NN include : • Solar irradiance – Changing NN from the NN has affected the NN of NNP in the past . However , we have not seen anything strong enough to VB our NN . Any increase in solar NN MD make the entire atmosphere of NNP warm , but we can only VB NN in the bottom layer . • Volcanic eruptions – Volcanoes have a mixed effect on our NN . Eruptions produce aerosol particles that cool NNP , but they RB release NN dioxide , which warms it . Volcanoes produce 50 times less NN dioxide than NNS do , so we VBP they are not the leading NN of JJ NN . On top of this , cooling is the dominant effect of volcanic eruptions , not NN . When looking at all the NN , there is a JJ scientific consensus that NNS are the leading NN of NN NN . In their latest report , the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP stated with over 95 % certainty that JJ activity is the main NN of JJ NN . Natural NN cycles can VB the NN of NNP , but the NNS we are seeing are happening at a scale and speed that natural cycles cannot explain . These cycles affect the JJ NN for NNS , or sometimes just months , not the 100 NNS that we have observed . Meanwhile , longer - term NNS IN Milankovitch cycles and solar irradiance take thousands and thousands of NNS . There are lots of things that affect NN NN , but the NN is irrefutable . JJ activity , such as burning fossil fuels and changing how we use the land , is the leading NN of NN NN ."

The Madurodam features little canals , old - fashioned windmills , tiny tulips and , amid it all , an homage to Royal Dutch Shell , the oil giant that is the biggest NN in the country and , by revenue , the second largest publicly traded oil - and - gas NN in the NN . There ’s a Shell drilling platform , a Shell gas station and a Shell natural - gas field , complete with a drilling rig . The display is at once odd–energy infrastructure in a NNS ’s theme park–and entirely fitting : Shell has been , for decades , CD of the most powerful players both in Dutch politics and on the JJ JJ stage . But that MD soon VB . As concerns grow over the existential challenges posed by NN NN , Shell must grapple with its own existential NN : How should a NN that generates most of its profits by serving the NN ’s enormous appetite for oil navigate a JJ - term future in which shifting JJ and JJ tides threaten to make fossil fuels obsolete ? The pressure to abandon oil and gas is already in force . In recent NNS , protesters have swarmed Shell ’s headquarters ; advocates representing 17,000 Dutch citizens have sued the NN ; and powerful investors successfully coerced executives to VB they will reduce NNS . In 2015 , NNS IN the NN promised to aggressively tackle NN - gas NNS , in order to meet the target laid out by the Paris Agreement : goals that require buying and burning significantly less oil and gas . Shell CEO Ben van Beurden has a bird ’s - eye view of the situation from his corner office at the NN ’s JJ headquarters in the Hague . “ We have to figure out what are the JJ bets to take in a NN that is completely changing because of society ’s concerns IN NN NN , ” he VBZ . Projections from NN NNS show demand for oil MD peak and fall in the coming decades ; some outside analyses suggest demand for oil MD plateau as soon as 2025 . Markets are already jittery about the industry : NN was the worst - performing sector on the S&P 500 index in 2019 . In 1980 , the NN industry represented 28 % of the index ’s value , according to the Institute for NNP Economics and Financial Analysis ( IEEFA ) . Last NN , it represented less than 5 % . The shift away from oil looms so JJ that Moody ’s warned in 2018 that the NN transition represents “ significant business and credit NN ” for oil NNS . The heads of the Banks of England and France VBD in an op - ed that any NN that does not VB strategically to the JJ NN reality “ will fail to exist . ” On Jan. 14 , Larry Fink , founder and CEO of investment giant BlackRock , wrote in an open letter that “ NN NN has become a defining factor in NNS ’ JJ - term prospects . ” As oil flirts with the prospect of decline , NN executives are at odds over what to do . Some firms , IN ExxonMobil , are positioning themselves to squeeze the last lucrative NNS from the oil economy while arguing to shareholders that they will be able to sell all their oil . Shell and a handful of others are beginning to adapt . Under van Beurden ’s leadership , Shell is charting a path that will allow it to continue to profit from oil and gas while simultaneously expanding its plastics business and diversifying into electrical NN . By the 2030s , the 112 - NN - old fossil - fuel giant wants to become the NN ’s largest NN NN . As part of this strategy , Shell has worked to present itself as environmentally friendly . Last NN , it committed to reduce its NNS by as much as 3 % by 2021 , and by RB 50 % by 2050 , tying its executives ’ compensation to the cuts . Shell ’s moves earned some applause among environmentalists , but the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP , the U.N. ’s NN - NN body , concluded in 2018 that to keep NNS from rising to levels that MD bring a wide range of catastrophes , NNS must halve their NN - gas NNS by 2030 and hit net - zero NNS by 2050 . That MD mean more than incrementally reducing NNS ; it means keeping vast reserves of oil already discovered in the ground . Van Beurden ’s strategic response shows that NNS of JJ and JJ pressure–especially from governments and investors responding to a sustained JJ outcry–can push RB the most powerful interests to VB . Whether NN activists can harness this mounting pressure to compel Shell and other oil NNS to transform the JJ NN economy MD be the weightiest question of our NN . Executives at Shell knew decades ago that burning fossil fuels MD VB the NN to warm , and that once NN NN became a JJ issue , their firm MD VB to VB . Last NN , I sat down with van Beurden for a wide - ranging interview and asked him how he felt about “ Shell knew , ” the activist mantra that accuses the NN of failing to act on NN NN despite knowing the consequences . He was sanguine : “ Yeah , we knew . Everybody knew , ” he VBD . “ And somehow we all ignored it . ” In the 1990s , he explained , Shell publicly acknowledged NN NN and VBD the NN needed to act to combat the problem . But at the NN , neither governments nor consumers seemed too concerned about NNS , and the demand for oil was growing IN gangbusters to fuel a JJ JJ expansion . So the NN dutifully responded to NN demands : it produced and sold oil to turn a profit . Nearly three decades later , Shell ’s business model is shifting by the same NN - driven calculus . Despite advertising that depicts the oil giant as environmentally friendly , its decision to reduce reliance on oil is not born of benevolence . It ’s reacting to NN forces . A 2019 McKinsey report predicts that declining gas consumption in the transport sector , because of factors IN fuel efficiency and electrification , MD lead oil demand to begin decreasing in the early 2030s . “ The future of NN needs to evolve as something else , ” van Beurden VBZ . “ And we find a role for ourselves in it . ” The shift away from oil is not just a macroeconomic calculation . In 2018 , NNP NNP 100+ , a powerful group of JJ investors that now represents $ 41 trillion in assets , delivered an ultimatum : either Shell committed to short - term NNS - reduction targets , or it risked losing the support of some of its largest shareholders . While NNP NNP 100 + held little formal NN over Shell , the investors MD wreak havoc within the NN by opposing management in shareholder votes , a process where shareholders can force management to take specific actions . In an extreme NN , the investors MD ditch their Shell NN –which MD undermine share prices , tank the NN ’s valuation and drag down executive pay . “ Politics might be pretty confused and babbling at the moment , ” VBZ Anne Simpson , director of JJ governance at CalPERS , the largest JJ pension fund in the U.S. , and a steering - committee member at NNP NNP 100 + . “ But NN talks . ” Meanwhile , a Dutch - led group of investors VBN as Follow This actually went ahead with a series of activist shareholder resolutions that , if they had garnered the support of 75 % of shareholders , MD have required the NN to take aggressive NN NN . While the resolutions failed , the threat was real . By December 2018 , Shell relented and , a few months later , made the commitment to reducing NNS as much as 3 % by 2021 . Significantly , the commitment included end - use NNS : the NN was agreeing to take responsibility not only for its own operations , but RB for how consumers use Shell ’s NNS . The activist investors claimed victory . “ The only reason Shell has made this leap forward is because investors started supporting our resolution , ” Follow This founder Mark van Baal VBD me . Shell ’s JJ commitment was part of a broader rebranding effort . For decades , Shell and other oil - and - gas NNS portrayed themselves to consumers as essential to modern NN . Their NNS VBP your car and warm your NN . But over the NNS , that image has soured . The 2010 BP oil spill and a series of journalistic exposés of the industry ’s misbehavior stole headlines . Shell faced reports of corruption in Nigeria , where it has significant drilling operations , including its alleged complicity in NN JJ - rights abuses . Organizers VBP that in September 2019 , more than 7 CD NNS marched IN the globe , skipping school and work to demand that their governments take NN to reduce NN - gas NNS . The U.K. declared a NN emergency and prominent members of the U.S. Congress called to eliminate the country ’s fossil - fuel NNS by 2030 . In July , the head of OPEC , the oil cartel that in 2018 accounted for more than 40 % of the NN ’s crude - oil production , called NN activists “ the greatest threat to our industry . ” Widespread JJ criticism of NNP Oil is perhaps especially damaging to Shell . Unlike JJ of its competitors , Shell purchases much of its oil from other NNS , then slaps the Shell brand on it , rather than digging the stuff out of the ground itself . That means that its consumer reputation matters more than , VB , Occidental Petroleum’s . Shell RB faces scrutiny as a Netherlands - VBN NN . While U.S. firms IN ExxonMobil contend with a relatively conservative JJ environment in Texas , Shell is headquartered in the Hague , a city where you ’re more likely to VB hit by a bicycle than a car . In Amsterdam , 40,000 NNS took to the streets last spring to demand NN on NN NN , and some protesters carried signs with a version of the Shell logo fashioned into a middle finger . In London , protesters demonstrated outside Shell ’s offices , graffitiing the walls with slogans IN crime scene and Shell kills . “ Their own NN is built on the death and destruction of nature and of NNS all IN the NN , ” VBZ Farhana Yamin , a lawyer turned activist who glued herself to the cement outside Shell ’s London headquarters last April . The National Theatre in London dropped Shell as a sponsor in October , just as it declared a “ NN emergency , ” and the Dutch branch of Friends of the NNP is suing Shell for reneging on its “ duty of care ” obligation under Dutch law . “ All of these initiatives add to the pressure , ” VBZ Freek Bersch , a campaigner at Friends of the NNP Netherlands . Van Beurden certainly feels the heat . In recent regulatory filings Shell listed its “ societal licence to operate , ” industry lingo for how society views the NN , among its key concerns . Shell executives now VBP “ to ask ourselves more questions than just , ‘ Hey , is this legal or not ? ' ” van Beurden VBZ . They have to consider how society sees their brand . To witness exactly how Shell is changing , I visited CD of its biggest ongoing investments : a chemical facility outside of Pittsburgh estimated to cost $ 6 CD . When it ’s completed , the nearly 400 - acre site will churn out more than a CD tons of polyethylene every NN , the base for a host of plastic NNS that MD become anything from packaging to toys to JJ devices to car parts . Activists describe the facility as an JJ nightmare . Studies have VBN plastic in tap NN , in food NNS , and in the bellies of NN birds and whales . And plastic production is a significant driver of NN NN . The chemical sector is responsible for 18 % of industrial NN - dioxide NNS , according to a 2018 report from the International NNP Agency . NNS are expected to grow 30 % by 2050 . But , for Shell , the investment is emblematic of its future business model . As the NN rethinks its business , it plans to expand in plastics . Shell ’s other JJ bet outside of oil is natural gas , which is RB controversial . When burned , natural gas produces less NN than oil or coal does , but it ’s still much more polluting than renewable sources , IN solar or wind . But Shell is all - in : in CD , the NN maneuvered a $ 53 CD takeover of BG Group , an oil - and - gas NN that focused on liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) , and CD NNS later Shell announced it MD fund a $ 31 CD LNG - export terminal in Canada along with other partners . Shell is widely VBN as CD of the NN ’s leading natural - gas producers . The NN argues that natural gas is necessary to back up clean - NN sources IN wind and solar and to feed growing demand for NN in the developing NN . The NN ’s least contentious area of NN is its investment in the NN sector , delivering electricity to homes and businesses . While the NN sector is widely seen as essential to reducing NNS , critics point out that it ’s a tiny portion of Shell ’s portfolio . Shell is now spending up to $ 2 CD a NN building out its capacity to supply electricity –just a sliver of its roughly $ 25 CD capital expenditure , which is predominantly spent exploring and drilling for oil . But Shell is rethinking its oil business , too , in recognition that its most expensive drilling ventures wo n’t work in the future if oil demand slows . In 2015 , it ended its effort to drill in the Arctic , and in 2017 it sold off billions of Canadian oil - sand assets . Meanwhile , Shell ’s total oil reserves have slowly declined compared with its competitors ’ . In December 2018 , ExxonMobil had more than 17 NNS of oil reserves stored , BP had nearly 15 and Chevron more than 11 , according to Bloomberg NN . Shell maintained only 81/2 NNS of reserves . Analysts VBP it ’s too early to tell whether Shell ’s strategy to reduce reliance on oil will pay off for shareholders in the JJ run . Last NN , Shell , while continuing to pay JJ dividends , bought back NN , helping maintain its share NN . The maneuver kept the NN ’s NN valuation roughly level , but it ’s hardly a workable JJ - term strategy . Across the sector , NNS “ have to figure out who they are in this changing NN , ” VBZ Tom Sanzillo , director of finance at the IEEFA . “ They are not the profit center that they VBD to be , and they probably never will be . ” The viability of sticking with oil , RB as major NN economies promise to move away , is uncertain . Both ExxonMobil and Chevron are staying the course , hoping to outlast their competitors . But Shell and others are moving to adapt . BP , for instance , has RB invested in natural gas and NN , while ConocoPhillips has prioritized “ short - cycle project times ” to VB it stay economically competitive . Occidental has dropped NN into a method of drilling that allows it to store CO2 in the ground , a bet that it can offset some of the regulatory costs of CO2 NNS within its own operations . And in December , the Spanish oil giant Repsol committed to being NN - neutral by 2050 and wrote down JJ of its oil assets on the grounds that their value will diminish as oil fades . Meanwhile , the landscape for the NN remains bleak . To keep average JJ NNS from VBG more than 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels , oil NNS MD have to agree to keep trillions of dollars of oil assets in the ground . So while Shell and others are taking steps in the JJ direction to reduce total NNS , they are still barreling into a catastrophically NN - changed future . “ Shell is doing a lot of the JJ things , ” VBZ a senior NN official , who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely . “ The question is : What award do you VB for being the best - painted deck chair on the Titanic ? ” Last spring , Shell announced that it was leaving NNP Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers , an influential oil - industry trade lobby . The group ’s position on NN NN , Shell VBD , was incompatible with its own . Shell cited AFPM ’s lack of support for the Paris Agreement and for NN pricing . The NN made a splash . Shell appeared to be firing a shot across the bow to other powerful lobbying groups : the politics on NN NN is shifting . VB with the program or VB left in the dust . It was the latest in a series of similar moves . In recent NNS , Shell , as well as Exxon and BP , left the NNP Legislative Exchange Council , a conservative JJ group , over its stance on NN NN . In 2014 , Shell and other major JJ oil NNS convened to form the Oil and Gas NNP Initiative to fund clean - NN ventures , and in 2017 , a consortium of JJ Fortune 500 NNS , including Shell , Total , ExxonMobil and BP , joined with a handful of green groups to launch the NNP Leadership Council to advocate in the U.S. for a NN tax that reflects “ the conservative principles of free markets and limited NN . ” A related lobbying group has spent several CD dollars lobbying Congress for the proposal . Critics largely dismiss these efforts as too little , too late . They question the NNS ’ sincerity and suggest they MD abandon their support when push comes to shove . And , given the scale of the challenge , JJ argue that the NN has RB passed for incremental initiatives . But given the central role the oil - and - gas industry plays in both politics and the JJ economy , it ’s hard to imagine the NN tackling NN NN unless the industry either loses its JJ NN or stops roadblocking NN solutions . The rise of the oil industry is intrinsically intertwined with the rise of modern capitalism and the 20th century NN economy . Oil provided the resources to VB the near nonstop GDP growth of the postwar era . That history offers the modern oil industry immense JJ NN , which it has VBN to block any legislation , including NN initiatives , that MD curb its profits . In particular , NNP Oil has spent decades funding campaigns to discredit the NN linking NN - gas NNS to NN and later spent millions more on messages that downplayed the catastrophic significance of NN NN . For the most part , they have been successful both in blocking bills that MD have curbed NNS and in securing NN support for their business . Senator Sheldon Whitehouse ( D. , R.I. ) , who wrote a book on corporate influence in NN , VBD me he does n’t “ VB there ’s ever been such JJ might assembled on CD issue in the history of the Congress ” as oil - and - gas interests fighting NN - VB regulation . Globally , fossil fuels receive roughly $ 5 trillion annually in NN subsidies , a figure that includes the cost of JJ damage caused by industry that ’s left to everyone else to clean up , according to a 2019 International Monetary Fund paper . But if NNP Oil ’s roots are deep , belief is growing across the globe that the industry ’s untouchable status needs to end . Beyond activists , JJ opinion in the U.S. continues to turn against fossil fuels . According to a 2019 Gallup poll , 60 % of U.S. adults , including the vast majority of Democrats and a JJ share of Republicans , support policies aimed at reducing the use of fossil fuels . Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , both of whom are polling at the top of the Democratic presidential primary , have promised to ban fracking–a move that ( though unlikely ) MD transform the industry overnight . And , across the Atlantic , a Green Deal in the E.U. unveiled late last NN proposes , among other things , to create a JJ tax on imports that MD hit oil NNS . RB the Shell display at Madurodam , that strange miniature theme park in the Hague , has been condemned by activists . Basic JJ factors RB loom JJ . This NN , analysts expect that JJ overleveraged oil firms in West Texas will likely VB bankrupt , and those that stay afloat will face withering headwinds . Production of low - cost shale oil means some established NNS will VB to continue to reassess their portfolio to turn a profit . Meanwhile , both geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and disagreements over trade continue to rattle the industry : JJ operations require safely and efficiently moving vast amounts of oil across borders . Despite the gathering momentum to wean the economy off fossil fuels , we ’re not there yet . Analysts predict oil will continue to dominate the JJ economy into the early 2030s . And RB as this transition takes place , NNP Oil will likely continue to wield outsize JJ influence . In the U.S. , the coal industry is a shadow of what it once was as NNS struggle to turn a profit , but the NNP Administration continues to work on behalf of its barons . Oil executives MD , at any rate , prefer to avoid coal ’s fate . In his office in the Hague , van Beurden considers the uncertainty facing his NN over the next decade : souring JJ perception , shifting consumer behavior , the NN of becoming activist investors ’ next target , JJ leaders ’ bold promises to dramatically reduce NNS . In this environment , van Beurden VBZ , NNS IN Shell must be ready to adapt . “ It ’s the NN we live in , ” he VBZ . “ I have to find a NN to make the most of that . ” This appears in the January 27 , 2020 issue of NNP ."

The JJ Prez and NNP Lady have been renting the NN this summer and loved it so much , we ’ve learned they made an offer . The property is listed at $ 14,850,000 . Our sources VBP they ’re paying less , but we do n’t VB how much . The estate — incredible . It ’s 29 beachfront acres . The main residence is just shy of 6,900 square NNS . It has 7 bedrooms , so Sasha and Malia have a place to crash , along with several of their friends . It has the obligatory pool , an outdoor fireplace , a chef ’s kitchen , vaulted ceilings and 2 guest wings . It has incredible views , especially while soaking in the second - floor balcony Jacuzzi .

But as NN leaders gather in Madrid this week to refine their pledges to cut heat - trapping gases , a JJ group of US cities , NNS , universities and businesses remain committed to holding JJ NN below 2 degrees Celsius . Their message to the NN ? That the US is still fighting to avoid the worst consequences of NN NN . And despite the policies of this administration , a JJ report shows that this broad coalition is significantly reducing US NN gas NNS and RB deeper cuts are possible with or without federal NN . The report titled "" Accelerating NNP 's Pledge "" finds that policies already in place by NN , local and business actors can reduce NN gas NNS by 25 % by 2030 compared to 2005 levels . This current coalition of the willing represents 68 % of US gross domestic product , which MD make it the NN 's second largest economy , second to only the US economy itself , according to the report . "" We can VB to the international community , ' Hey , you guys hear a lot about what 's not happening in the US , but what you might not VB is that there is a tremendous amount of activity that can actually make a difference in terms of overall US NNS , ' "" VBD Nate Hultman , director of the Center for NNP Sustainability at the NNP of Maryland and the lead author of the report . The authors of the report -- which was produced by the "" NNP 's Pledge "" initiative led by Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg and JJ California Gov. Jerry Brown -- VBD that RB more significant cuts are possible with further shifts toward renewable NN , improved efficiency in buildings and transportation , and protection of forests and other NN - storing ecosystems . If NN and local governments along with the private sector further enhanced their NN commitments , overall US NNS MD fall RB further by 37 % by 2030 , the NN VBD . But the report shows that to VB the US within striking distance of its Paris Agreement goals , executive and legislative NN will be required . Mixed messages from the US on NN NN The report comes as NN and local actors try to carry on the fight to halt NN NN without federal support and reflects both the potential and limits of this current bifurcated US NN policy . But there is a second group from the US in Madrid -- a band of lawmakers , city and NN officials , plus private sector and educational leaders -- seeking to fill the void of leadership they VBP has been left by the NNP administration . Their goal is to convince the rest of the NN that the US is still in the fight to avert the worst consequences of NN NN . On Friday , the US NNP NNP Center opened in Madrid with a slate of speakers and events . During COP25 , the NN center will serve as a hub for an array of US leaders planning to show other NNS the steps they are taking to combat the NN NN . "" Throughout the course of history , the US has been seen as a leader . And with an issue as pressing as this NN , we should n't take a backseat to anybody , "" VBD Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes , who is representing the US NNP Alliance , a bipartisan coalition of governors committed to the Paris Agreement goals . In the absence of federal NN to address the NN NN , this has become the JJ normal . At the past CD major gatherings of NN negotiators ( COP23 and COP24 ) since NNP came into office , this alliance has set up shop on the sidelines -- separate from the federal delegation . "" CD of the major concerns I VBP is the NN that the US has participated in these talks -- being in and being out , and then being in and being out , "" VBD Elan Strait , director of US NN campaigns at the NNP Wildlife Fund . "" The rest of the NN is obviously very tired of that . "" Both in the US presidential NN and at next NN 's COP26 in Glasgow , the stakes are high when it comes to the fate of the NN . The Madrid meetings this week are the last major negotiations before 2020 , the NN when the Paris agreement goes into effect . Ahead of COP26 , JJ NNS will VB to increase their commitments to cut NNS to VB on track to meet the Paris goals . Though the US has formally withdrawn from the Paris accord , under the agreement 's framework , the process cannot be completed until November 4 , 2020 , which happens to be the day after the 2020 presidential NN . Should NNP lose , a JJ NN MD rejoin the agreement , but MD VB to commit the US to cutting its heat - trapping gas NNS RB further ."

On Mondays , she wrapped herself in several layers , including a heavy - duty parka and bulky orange boots with superinsulated soles , and ventured into the polar darkness . Driving snowmobiles loaded with equipment , she and her fellow researchers , on alert for cracks and fissures , caravanned over the jagged NN of the NN . After setting up a tent as a partial shield against the wind and bitter cold , and wearing red-filtered headlamps to avoid disturbing light - sensitive microbes , the researchers VBD a battery - powered drill fitted with a spinning circular blade and a three - NN - JJ barrel to draw about CD dozen cores out of the NN . For the next several hours they carefully sliced the cores into sections , calling out precise measurements for Creamean to record . Outside the tent stood a guard armed with a rifle and a flare gun , scanning the horizon for approaching polar bears . Creamean , an atmospheric scientist at Colorado NNP NNP , is CD of more than 300 researchers participating in a wildly ambitious , eye - wateringly expensive yearlong expedition called MOSAiC , the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the NNP of Arctic NNP . The observatory in question is the expedition ’s research vessel , a German icebreaker called the Polarstern , which set sail from Norway last September . When the Polarstern reached Arctic waters , the researchers chose an NN floe that they believed was thick and sturdy enough to last through the summer , then moored the ship to the floe and waited for the NN to freeze IN it . The Polarstern and its floe are now indeed drifting across the Arctic Ocean , and if all goes well , they will continue to do so until the expedition ends in September 2020 . The researchers hail from more than 70 institutions across 20 NNS , and IN the polar explorers of old they are driven to understand CD of the NN ’s grandest , most mysterious and least hospitable regions . But this is an Arctic their predecessors MD barely recognize — and that is precisely the point of the expedition . Over the past three decades , the extent of Arctic NN NN in September , at the end of the summer melt , has declined by 30 percent . Since 2002 , the record low for summer NN has been broken four times , and several other recent NNS have come close to setting JJ records . NNS VBP this is in part because the dark ocean NN absorbs more heat from the NN than NN NN does , which is contributing to a worrisome feedback loop — NN leads to melting NN , which leads to more NN — promising more and swifter melting in the future . Because the Arctic plays such an important role in cooling the NN , MOSAiC ’s goal is to understand how the NN , atmosphere and ocean are interacting in a NN Arctic , and how those dynamics affect NN IN the globe . CD group of MOSAiC researchers is studying the currents that move seawater in and out of the Arctic , and how ocean NNS affect atmospheric conditions as well as the freezing and melting of NN . Some are studying the cracks and gaps that form in the NN as NNS warm . Others are gauging the levels of NN gases in the ocean and atmosphere . In addition , research aircraft were scheduled to begin flights from Svalbard , Norway , in mid-March to complement atmospheric measurements on the NN , but they were delayed after a German - VBN team member tested positive for NNP - CD . ( There is no indication that anybody on the ship was exposed . ) MOSAiC researchers are RB studying the tiny organisms that live on the NN and in the surrounding NN , and Creamean is especially interested in these NN - forms . During her NN on the Polarstern , she studied microbes in Arctic NN and seawater she collected , measuring the minuscule amounts of methane and other gases the microbes digest or produce during their NN cycles . She RB collected air samples to VB how algae , bacteria and other particles blown into the air act as nuclei for NN crystals in the atmosphere , “ seeding ” the formation of Arctic clouds — clouds that in turn affect the amounts of snow and sunlight that reach the NN NN . The work poses countless challenges . Fissures can form in the NN and block the NN to established research sites , forcing the researches to find alternative routes . The NNS plummeted to 20 degrees below zero . In mid-November , a violent storm opened up a JJ crack between the Polarstern and its floe , knocking over a 100 - NN meteorological tower and threatening to snap NN cables . But spirits remained high , according to Creamean , sustained by the international camaraderie and RB the occasional soccer game on the NN . During JJ hours in the NN - coring tent , Creamean MD occasionally step outside and gaze at the NN or the stars and try to take in the vastness of the Arctic night . “ Sometimes the blowing snow MD sparkle , and you ’d just be struck by the beauty of it all , ” she VBZ . “ To VB that you were CD of the very few NNS who had ever seen that , who had ever stepped NN up there — it was awe - inspiring . ” In early January , Creamean flew home to Colorado hauling an Igloo cooler packed with samples of Arctic seawater , NN and air . Over the coming months , she ’ll identify the bacteria , phytoplankton and other microorganisms in her samples from their DNA . Then , she ’ll mimic the process of cloud formation in her lab , watching to VB which kinds of microbes most readily seed clouds at subzero NNS . Later , she ’ll repeat the process with samples brought back from the Polarstern during spring , summer and fall to observe how the makeup of the atmosphere VBZ as NNS warm , the NN melts , and microbes in the NN NN are blown into the air . Eventually , she hopes to pin down the precise role microbes in the melting NN play in the formation of the clouds . “ It ’s a JJ piece of the puzzle , but it ’s a crucial NN , ” she VBZ . “ If we can better understand how clouds form , we can better understand how Arctic NN and NN is affected by JJ processes — and how those NNS will affect all of us . ”"

Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez will co-chair a panel advising Joe Biden on NN policy as the apparent Democratic nominee takes steps to unify the party , it was announced on Wednesday . Biden VBD that Ocasio - Cortez is on CD of the six policy panels in comments to Las Vegas CBS affiliate KLAS - TV on Tuesday , when the JJ vice NN was asked what he was doing to bring supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders into the fold . "" We 've made some NNS , we 've listened to the Bernie supporters and , you VBP , for example , we have congresswoman Ocasio - Cortez , she is on CD of the panels as well , "" Biden VBD . "" And so I VBP we 're VBG to have a very VBN party . "" In a joint statement announcing participants of the six “ Unity Task Forces ” released by Biden and Sanders on Wednesday , Ocasio - Cortez is listed as a co-chair of the NN NN task force along with Biden endorser , JJ Secretary of NNP John Kerry . The JJ 2004 presidential candidate and senator notably created the Paris NNP Agreement struck between numerous NNS under the Obama administration . Ocasio - Cortez , who had endorsed Bernie Sanders months before he dropped out of the race in April , will be serving as Sanders ' representative on the committee convened by Biden dealing with NN policy , her spokeswoman VBD . "" She made the decision with members of the NNP Justice community — and she will be fully accountable to them and the larger advocacy community during this process , "" spokeswoman Lauren Hitt VBD in an email . Hitt VBD that Ocasio - Cortez , D - N.Y. , "" believes the movement will only be successful if we continue to apply pressure both inside and outside the NN , "" and added that "" this is just CD element of the broader fight for just policies . ” Other notable names serving on that task force are healthcare co-chairs Rep. Pramila Jayapal , D - Wash . , and JJ Obama era Surgeon General Vivek Murthy , who has briefed Biden daily on the NN - CD NN . The Obama administration ’s Attorney General Eric Holder will serve on criminal justice , which is chaired by Rep. Bobby Scott , D - Va. , whose SAFE Justice Act Biden has RB championed on the campaign trail . The six task forces were created last month after Sanders formally dropped out of the race to ensure that Biden MD win over key coalitions of his progressive supporters as he mobilizes to beat NNP Donald NNP with a VBN Democratic front . The groups will meet ahead of the Democratic National Convention to shape policy for the convention platform committee and Biden ’s agenda . “ A NNP party is key to defeating Donald NNP this November and moving our country forward through an unprecedented NN . As we work toward our shared goal , it is especially critical that we not lose sight of the pressing issues facing Americans , ” Biden VBD in a statement Wednesday . Sanders echoed the sentiment , commending Biden “ for working together with my campaign to assemble a group of leading thinkers and activists who can and will unify our party in a transformational and progressive direction . "" Sanders , I - Vt. , ended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on April 8 , and at the NN the pledged to have significant influence over the party platform . Sanders went on to officially endorse Biden for NN less than a week later . Biden , in the Tuesday interview with KLAS , which was done over the internet amid the NN NN , referenced the Sanders ' endorsement . The JJ vice NN RB seemed to suggest that Sanders ' supporters MD have gotten the wrong idea about his positions during the campaign . "" My message to all — and what they 're finding out now that the nomination process is de facto over , they 're finding out the positions I had on an awful lot of things were not accurately characterized and they 're feeling more comfortable with it , "" Biden VBD . "" But I 'm listening . I 'm here , I VBP them , and I hope they all will join us . "" Since Sanders ’ departure from the race Biden has extended multiple olive branches to his supporters , adopting policies on healthcare and education and hashing out a deal that ensures Sanders ’ earned delegates are represented on the convention floor in August . Although Sanders suspended his campaign , he remains on the ballot in primaries . On Tuesday Biden easily defeated Sanders in the Nebraska Democratic primary , NBC NNP projected . The win padded Biden 's delegate count tally to 1,490 of the 1,991 needed to secure the nomination ."

In the NNS to come , as NN NN continues to bear the blame for everything from bushfires , drought , hurricanes , biblical - style rainfall and RB record snowfall , we might just look back at a recent NNP Nations ruling as the tipping point for the greatest - ever JJ migration shift . For the UN has put the developed NN on notice , and let ’s be frank , it is those prosperous nations they are lecturing to that refugees will have a NN to be relocated to from their drought - stricken , NN - logged or hurricane - devastated home NNS if the conditions at home subject their JJ rights to a violation . What exactly constitutes NN NN in a legal sense here is anyone ’s guess , but that ’s not a problem for the UN to consider , as it has just kicked that particular can down the road for those nations besieged by NN migrants in , VB 2035 , to deal with . The judgement was made after the ( unsuccessful ) claim of Ioane Teitiota , a NN from the Pacific nation of Kiribati , a collection of 33 islands threatened by rising NN levels who had applied for protection in NNP Zealand in 2013 , claiming his and his family ’s lives were at NN . Mr Teitiota was already deported from NNP Zealand in 2015 . The NNP Zealand courts rejected his claim , and the UN JJ rights committee upheld its decision saying there was NN for Kiribati and the international community to take affirmative NN and relocate its population but – and there was a JJ ‘ but ’ – the future effects of NN NN evident in some NNS MD mean it MD be considered a violation of a migrant ’s JJ rights – thus illegal – to be returned home by a nation in which they were seeking to enter . This is the sort of ruling that gives leaders and policymakers in the nations of southern Europe in particular , as well as those further north , sleepless nights . Did someone VB “ build a wall ” ? They VBP decisions being made about far - away lands that will have a sledgehammer impact on their own NNS in the not - too - distant future . For JJ governments , it is hard enough determining who is and who is n’t a legitimate refugee claiming protection from religious , sexual or racial discrimination . Clearly identifying the Chinese Muslims from the Sudanes Christians or transgender Afghans is tricky on its own . Now we have to take a potential migrant ’s NN concerns into consideration ? Do NNS of drought – or is it NNS of flood – constitute a threat to someone ’s JJ rights ? Is the heavy rainfall on the coast of South NNP down to the effects of that regular menace El Nino , or something more JJ term happening on the polar NN caps ? While the NN in general – excuse us , Mr NNP – is starting to identify JJ of the modern JJ phenomena as the results of JJ NN , NNS RB now are still a little fuzzy about the particulars . And there are so JJ issues to consider . There are sinking islands , IN Kiribati and the Maldives , there are bushfires in Australia , there are summer heatwaves in Greece and unparalleled rainfall in northern England . There are targets , declarations , denunciations , forums , committees , NNS , politicians , religious leaders and RB Swedish teenagers all creating a massive incoherent clamour from which it is impossible to distill any CD distinct message , apart from “ we ’re all gonna die , ” which most of us VBP anyway . And now we have the prospect of those experiencing unsettling NN extremes and looking to migrate being given UN support in seeking to move somewhere less volatile climatically ."

""_'' Next_RB Getting_VBG Air_NN Traffic_NN Under_IN Control_NN","NNP does n't seem to care CD bits about JJ NN , and it 's not hard to VB why . Most Russians MD probably be happy if the country was a little warmer . Officials RB joke that once NN NN has run its course , NNS MD start pouring into Siberia instead of trying to escape it . If the polar NN caps melt any further , NNP MD be able to drill for oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean , where it 's believed to have huge fossil - fuel reserves . For the rest of the NN , however , the picture is not so cheerful . To VB that NNP is hesitant about tackling NN NN is putting it mildly . The last NN the NN tried to VB the country 's cooperation on the issue was in 1997 , during negotiations for the Kyoto Protocol ( the international treaty on limiting NN - gas NNS ) . Because NNP is the NN 's third largest source of NNS after the U.S. and NNP , the accord MD have failed without it . So the treaty was written in a NN that MD allow NNP to keep polluting as much as it wanted and grant the country billions of dollars in NNS allowances to sell to other NNS that needed to meet their Kyoto commitments . As a U.N. official who participated in the talks put it , "" NNP got the sweetest deal : free NN , no restrictions . "" But apparently RB that was n't enough . It took another seven NNS of painstaking negotiations  and promises from the West to VB NNP join the NNP Trade Organization ( WTO )  to VB the country to ratify the deal . How the NN will persuade NNP to take an active part in the upcoming NN - NN summit in Copenhagen on Dec. 2 remains to be seen . NNS VBP this is the last real chance that JJ leaders have to deal with JJ NN before its effects become irreversible , and this NN RB there are few obvious carrots with which to bait the Kremlin . ( NNP has since abandoned plans to join the WTO . ) And NNP has already indicated that it is not putting a high priority on the talks . In June , NNP Dmitri Medvedev announced the country 's NNS targets , which MD effectively VB NNP spew 30 % more NN gases into the atmosphere by 2020 than it does today . "" We will not cut our development potential , "" Medvedev VBD at the NN . Then , at a preliminary round of NN talks in Copenhagen in late October , NNP sent an RB more disappointing message . The head of the country 's delegation , Mikhail Zelikhanov , a parliamentary deputy for Prime Minister Valdimir Putin 's NNP NNP Party , questioned the basic premise of the fight against NN NN . "" Scientific circles in NNP and elsewhere still do not have a VBN opinion on the causes of JJ NN , "" Zelikhanov VBD the group of lawmakers from 16 NNS in the hall of the Danish parliament . He suggested that an international panel be created to VB whether or not JJ NN was the result of JJ actions and whether it MD be stopped by cutting pollution . Zelikhanov is part of a growing chorus of JJ - NN skeptics in NNP . At a NN conference in St. Petersburg in 2007 , Sergei Mironov , the speaker of the upper NN of parliament , VBD experts that a process of "" JJ cooling "" was in fact taking place . As NN , he cited the paintings of the 16th century Dutch masters , whose warmly colored landscapes , he VBD , showed that NNS were indeed higher back then . And last month , the NN - run Channel NNP television station aired a documentary called The History of a Deception : NNP NNP , which claimed that a NN NN had invented the idea that pollution is to blame for NN NN . None of this bodes especially well for the success of the December summit . "" It will not be possible to finalize an agreement without the participation of NNP , "" VBZ Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen , who is spearheading the negotiations . "" We will VB to engage NNP in this dialogue . "" This might be possible through concessions , though . Last month , Denmark put itself on Moscow 's good side when it became the JJ country to approve the construction of NNP 's Nord Stream gas pipeline through the Baltic NNP . On Nov. 2 , Rasmussen received a sign of support from Putin on NN NN , albeit a slightly vague NN . "" Are we ready to support Danish efforts to promote the ideas of the post - Kyoto period ? Yes , we are , "" Putin VBD at a joint press conference with Rasmussen . A European official involved in the negotiations VBZ NNP 's fear of isolation MD RB compel it to cooperate . With the U.S. and NNP taking the lead in the NN - NN summit and Brazil and India playing an active role , NNP MD be the largest polluter and the only major NN not helping to solve the NN . "" They wo n't VB to be the bad guy , "" VBZ the official , who spoke last month in Copenhagen on condition of anonymity . But another member of the Russian delegation at the October talks left little room for optimism . Elena Chistyakova , chief adviser to the parliament 's foreign affairs committee , VBZ NNP MD sign the treaty  and that 's it . "" [ NNP ] will drag out the ratification as RB as they can . And if they ratify it , then they 'll drag out the implementation , "" she VBZ . "" There 's just no JJ will . "" Next Getting Air Traffic Under NN"

""_''","Refugees fleeing their native NNS due to the effects of the NN NN in future NNS MD not be forced to return if their lives are in danger , the NNP Nations NNP Rights Committee VBD in a ruling Monday . The committee anticipates a flood of "" millions "" of NN refugees in the near future . The JJ - of - its - kind ruling — which a U.N. official called "" powerfully symbolic "" — came in the NN of Ioane Teitiota , who applied for protection in NNP Zealand in 2013 . Teitiota claimed his family 's lives were at NN in his home nation of Kiribati , a country severely threatened by rising NN levels . And while he actually lost his NN , the U.N. committee took the opportunity to make a broader statement about NN refugees . The situation in Tarawa , Teitiota 's home island , "" has become increasingly unstable and precarious due to NN - level rise caused by JJ NN , "" his counsel VBD . Saltwater contamination and overcrowding on the island have resulted in scarce freshwater resources and a growing housing NN . In 1947 , South Tarawa was home to just 1,671 NNS . In 2010 , its population surpassed 50,000 after nearby islands became uninhabitable . By 2017 , Kiribati's population had soared to over 100,000 NNS . Additionally , storm surges and high tides have flooded residential areas . The population of the island suffers from vitamin deficiencies , malnutrition , fish poisoning and other ailments resulting from food insecurity . Unemployment has surged in the region and diseases spread easily through overcrowding and poor quality drinking NN . "" Kiribati has thus become an untenable and violent environment for the author and his family , "" the NN argued . NNS warn it MD become uninhabitable within decades . Teitota applied for refugee status in NNP Zealand after his visa expired in 2010 . He was forced to return to Kiribati in September 2015 — putting his NN and the lives of his family at NN , he VBD . Teitota 's application was rejected , but he appealed , claiming the ruling violated his NN to NN . NNP Zealand 's NNP of Appeal and Supreme NNP each denied subsequent appeals , so he filed a complaint with the U.N. 's NNP Rights Committee . On Monday , the U.N. committee issued its judgment in the NN . It ruled against Teitota — stating his NN was not in immediate NN — but VBD that NNS in places where NN NN poses an immediate threat to their lives MD not be forced to return . "" The timeframe of CD to 15 NNS , as suggested by the author , MD allow for intervening acts by the Republic of Kiribati , with the assistance of the international community , to take affirmative measures to protect and , where necessary , relocate its population , "" the ruling VBD . In the future , if the NN NN continues , governments MD be prohibited from sending NNS back to home NNS that pose immediate threats to NN due to NN NN , the committee held , and potential JJ rights violations caused by NN NN should be taken into account by nations considering the deportation of asylum seekers . "" Without robust national and international efforts , the effects of NN NN in receiving NNS MD expose individuals to a violation of their rights , "" the ruling VBD , citing articles 6 and 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and NNP Rights , ensuring NNS 's inherent NN to NN . While Kiribati's current situation was not enough to meet the standards of an immediate threat to NN , the decision MD become significant as the number of NN refugees is projected to increase . "" The decision sets a JJ precedent , "" VBD Kate Schuetze , Pacific researcher at Amnesty International . "" It VBZ a NN will be in breach of its JJ rights obligations if it returns someone to a country where — due to the NN NN — their NN is at NN , or in danger of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment . "" However , the ruling "" MD not apply to U.S. asylum decisions at this point , because the NN ruled against the claimant , "" reports CBS NNP ' Pamela Falk , "" but it opens the door to courts hearing NN claims in the future . "" "" It is powerfully symbolic , "" a U.N. official VBD Falk . The U.N. expects tens of millions of NNS to be displaced due to the NN NN in the next decade alone . A 2018 NNP Bank report predicted that 143 CD NNS from South Asia , Latin NNP and Sub-Saharan Africa MD be forced to migrate due to NN conditions by 2050 . "" The message is clear : Pacific Island NNPS do not VB to be underwater before triggering JJ rights obligations to protect the NN to NN , "" VBD Schuetze . At the NNP NNP Forum in Davos on Tuesday , NNP Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi VBD Reuters that the ruling has broad implications for governments . "" The ruling VBZ if you have an immediate threat to your NN due to NN NN , due to the NN emergency , and if you cross the border and VBP to another country , you should not be sent back , because you MD be at NN of your NN , just UH in a NN or in a situation of persecution , "" Grandi VBD . Wildfires , rising NN levels , crop destruction and floods are just a few of the results of the NN NN that MD drive JJ numbers of NNS from their homes . "" We must be prepared for a JJ surge of NNS moving against their will , "" he VBD . "" I MD n't venture to talk about specific numbers , it 's too speculative , but certainly we 're talking about millions here . """

Sandy shorelines of JJ high - population areas and tourist hot - spots are threatened by erosion , NN NN and surging NN levels . At - NN areas include Surfers ' Paradise in Queensland , St Tropez , Honolulu , Copacabana , the Costa del Sol and Weymouth . But researchers offer a glimmer of hope and VBP a moderate reduction in NN gas NNS MD prevent 40 per cent of the predicted loss . Researchers from the European Commission 's Joint Research Centre in Ispra in northern Italy analysed 30 NNS worth of satellite images of sandy beaches . NN author Dr Michalis Vousdoukas , who led the research , VBD : ' The results indicate RB 50 per cent of the NN 's sandy beaches are at NN of severe erosion . ' Half of the NN 's beaches MD disappear by the end of the century under current trends of NN NN and NN level rise . ' The situation can become more critical for JJ communities highly reliant on tourism . ' Sandy beaches occupy more than a third of the JJ coastline and are valuable in JJ ways as they provide JJ income via recreation and tourism . They are RB very environmentally valuable as they provide natural protection from storms and cyclones . However , erosion , NN level rises and changing NN threaten the coast 's infrastructure and NNS . Some NNS will be worse hit than others , with The Gambia and Guinea - Bissau facing the loss of over 60 per cent of their white sandy beaches . Overall , Australia MD be worst hit with RB 7,500 NNS ( 12,000 km ) of beach at NN . Canada , Chile , Mexico , NNP and the NNP NNPS MD RB be greatly affected . ' Between a quarter and a half of the UK 's sandy beaches will retreat by more than a hundred metres over the next century , depending on how rapidly the polar NN sheets melt , ' according to Professor Andrew Shepherd , Director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the NNP of Leeds . The researchers VBD computer modelling systems to forecast how the beaches , in their currently depleted NN , MD deteriorate as NN NN worsens . CD eventualities of ' representative concentration pathways ( RCP ) ' for JJ NN were predicted , each representing a future of varying severity . RCP8.5 is the highest level of projected NN gas NNS and RCP4.5 features less intense NNS that span over a JJ period of NN . Researchers looked at how JJ activity and geological processes causes shoreline retreat as well as the damage caused by storms to make their findings . Dr Suzana Ilic at Lancaster NNP VBD : ' This JJ research shows that about 30 per cent and 60 per cent of low lying areas fronted by sandy beaches will be seriously threatened by erosion , due to NN NN under the high emission of NN gases by the middle and the end of the 21st century respectively . ' Moderate reductions in NN gas NNS MD prevent 40 per cent of this loss , the NN authors suggest . Dr Ilic , who was not involved in the NN , added : ' It is encouraging to VB that reducing NNS from a high to moderate level will result in a reduction of the projected shoreline retreat of 22 per cent by 2050 and 40 per cent by 2100 .

Of the 184 member NNS of the NNP Nations , only CD NNS have failed to ratify the treaty –Somalia and the NNP NNPS . Somalia does not currently have an internationally recognized NN , so ratification is impossible , and the NNP NNPS , which was CD of the original signatories of the convention , has failed to ratify the treaty because of concerns about its potential impact on national sovereignty and the parent - NN relationship ."

Dickens is remembered as CD of the most important and influential writers of the 19th century . Among his accomplishments , he has been lauded for providing a stark portrait of the Victorian - era underclass , helping to bring about JJ NN . Dickens was born Charles John Huffam Dickens on February 7 , 1812 , in Portsmouth , on the southern coast of England . The famed British author was the second of eight NNS . His father , John Dickens , was a naval clerk who dreamed of striking it rich . Charles ' mother , Elizabeth Barrow , aspired to be a teacher and school director . Despite his NNS ’ best efforts , the family remained poor . Nevertheless , they were happy in the early days . In 1816 , they moved to Chatham , Kent , where young Dickens and his siblings were free to roam the countryside and explore the old castle at Rochester . In 1822 , the Dickens family moved to Camden Town , a poor neighborhood in London . By then the family ’s financial situation had grown dire , as John Dickens had a dangerous habit of living beyond the family ’s means . Eventually , John was sent to prison for debt in 1824 , when Charles was just 12 NNS old . Following his father ’s imprisonment , Dickens was forced to leave school to work at a boot - blacking factory alongside the River Thames . At the run-down , rodent - ridden factory , Dickens earned six shillings a week labeling pots of “ blacking , ” a substance VBN to clean fireplaces . It was the best he MD do to VB support his family . Looking back on the experience , Dickens saw it as the moment he VBD goodbye to his youthful innocence , stating that he wondered “ how [ he ] MD be so easily cast away at such a young age . ” He felt abandoned and betrayed by the adults who were supposed to take care of him . These sentiments MD later become a recurring theme in his writing . Much to his relief , Dickens was permitted to VB back to school when his father received a family inheritance and VBD it to pay off his debts . But when Dickens was 15 , his education was pulled out from under him once again . In 1827 , he had to drop out of school and work as an office boy to contribute to his family ’s income . As it turned out , the job became a launching point for his writing career . Within a NN of being hired , Dickens began freelance reporting at the law courts of London . Just a few NNS later , he was reporting for CD major London newspapers . In 1833 , he began submitting sketches to various magazines and newspapers under the pseudonym “ Boz . ” In 1836 , his clippings were published in his JJ book , Sketches by Boz . In the same NN , Dickens started publishing The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club . His series , originally written as captions for artist Robert Seymour ’s humorous sports - themed illustrations , took the form of monthly serial installments . The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club was wildly popular with readers . In fact , Dickens ’ captions were RB more popular than the illustrations they were meant to accompany . He later edited magazines including Household Words and All the NNP Round , the latter of which he founded . Dickens married Catherine Hogarth soon after his JJ book , Sketches by Boz , was published . The couple had a brood of CD NNS . During the 1850s , Dickens suffered CD devastating losses : the deaths of his daughter and father . He RB separated from his wife in 1858 . Dickens slandered Catherine publicly , and struck up an intimate relationship with a young actress named Ellen "" Nelly "" Ternan . Sources differ on whether the CD started seeing each other before or after Dickens ' marital separation ; it is RB believed that he went to great lengths to erase any documentation alluding to Ternan 's presence in his NN . Throughout his career , Dickens published a total of 15 novels . His most well - VBN works include : Oliver Twist , Dickens JJ novel , follows the NN of an orphan living in the streets . The book was inspired by how Dickens felt as an impoverished NN forced to VB by on his wits and earn his own keep . As publisher of a magazine called Bentley ’s Miscellany , Dickens began publishing Oliver Twist in installments between February 1837 and April 1838 , with the full book edition published in November 1838 . Dickens continued showcasing Oliver Twist in the magazines he later edited , including Household Words and All the NNP Round . The novel was extremely well - received in both England and NNP . Dedicated readers of Oliver Twist eagerly anticipated the next monthly installment . On December CD , 1843 , Dickens published A Christmas Carol . The book features the timeless protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge , a curmudgeonly old miser , who , with the NN of ghosts , finds the Christmas spirit . Dickens penned the book in just six weeks , beginning in October and finishing just in NN for the holiday celebrations . The novel was intended as a JJ criticism , to bring attention to the hardships faced by England ’s poorer classes . The book was a roaring success , selling more than 6,000 copies upon publication . Readers in England and NNP were touched by the book ’s empathetic emotional depth ; CD JJ entrepreneur reportedly gave his employees an extra day ’s holiday after reading it . Despite literary criticism , the book remains CD of Dickens ’ most well - VBN and beloved works . ' Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son ' ( 1846 to 1848 ) From October 1846 to April 1848 , Dickens published , in monthly installments , Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son . The novel , which was published in book form in 1848 , centers on the theme of how business tactics affect a family ’s personal finances . Taking a dark view of England , it is considered pivotal to Dickens ’ body of work in that it set the tone for his other novels . David Copperfield was the JJ work of its kind : No NN had ever written a novel that simply followed a character through his everyday NN . From NNP 1849 to November 1850 , Dickens published the book in monthly installations , with the full novel form published in November 1850 . In writing it , Dickens tapped into his own personal experiences , from his difficult childhood to his work as a journalist . Although David Copperfield is not considered Dickens ’ best work , it was his personal favorite . It RB helped define the NN ’s expectations of a Dickensian novel . Following the death of his father and daughter and separation from his wife , Dickens ’ novels began to express a darkened worldview . In Bleak NNP , published in installments from 1852 to 1853 , he deals with the hypocrisy of British society . It was considered his most complex novel to date . Hard Times takes place in an industrial town at the peak of JJ expansion . Published in 1854 , the book focuses on the shortcomings of employers as well as those who seek NN . Coming out of his “ dark novel ” period , in 1859 Dickens published A Tale of NNP Cities , a historical novel that takes place during the French Revolution in Paris and London . He published it in a periodical he founded , All the NNP Round . The story focuses on themes of the NN for sacrifice , the struggle between the evils inherent in oppression and revolution , and the possibility of resurrection and rebirth . Great Expectations , published in serial form between December 1860 to August 1861 and in novel form in October 1861 , is widely considered Dickens ’ greatest literary accomplishment . The story , Dickens ’ second to be narrated in the JJ person , focuses on the lifelong journey of moral development for the novel ’s protagonist , an orphan named Pip . With extreme imagery and colorful characters , the well - received novel ’s themes include wealth and poverty , love and rejection , and good versus evil . After the publication of Oliver Twist , Dickens struggled to match the level of its success . From 1838 to 1841 , he published The NNP and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby , The Old Curiosity Shop and Barnaby Rudge . Another novel from Dickens ’ darker period is Little Dorrit ( 1857 ) , a fictional NN of how JJ values come in conflict with the NN ’s brutality . Dickens ’ novel Our Mutual Friend , published in serial form between 1864 to 1865 before being published as a book in 1865 , analyzes the psychological impact of wealth on London society . Travels to the NNP NNPS and Italy In 1842 , Dickens and his wife , Catherine , embarked on a five - month lecture tour of the NNP NNPS . Upon their return , Dickens penned NNP Notes for General Circulation , a sarcastic travelogue criticizing JJ culture and materialism . IN this NN he RB wrote The NNP and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit , a story about a NN ’s struggle to survive on the ruthless JJ frontier . During his JJ U.S. tour , in 1842 , Dickens spoke of his opposition to slavery and expressed his support for additional reform . His lectures , which began in Virginia and ended in Missouri , were so widely attended that ticket scalpers gathered outside his events . Biographer J.B. Priestley wrote that during the tour , Dickens enjoyed "" the greatest welcome that probably any visitor to NNP has ever had . ” “ They flock IN me as if I were an idol , ” bragged Dickens , a VBN show - off . Although he enjoyed the attention at RB , he eventually resented the invasion of privacy . He was RB annoyed by what he viewed as Americans ’ gregariousness and crude habits , as he later expressed in NNP Notes . After his criticism of the JJ NNS during his JJ tour , Dickens launched a second U.S. tour , from 1867 to 1868 , hoping to set things RB with the NN . This NN , he made a charismatic speech promising to praise the NNP NNPS in reprints of NNP Notes for General Circulation and The NNP and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit . His 75 readings netted an estimated $ 95,000 , which , in the Victorian era , amounted to approximately $ 1.5 CD in current U.S. dollars . Back at home , Dickens had become so famous that NNS recognized him all over London as he strolled IN the city , collecting the observations that MD serve as inspiration for his future work . Dickens RB spent significant NN in Italy , resulting in his 1846 travelogue Pictures from Italy ."

Uehlinger explains , “ What the Clintons rely on is most Americans do n’t RB understand the security procedures . So , they can throw up a lot of smoke and mirrors that confuses NNS and makes them VB that this was not so much of a problem . But NNS in the NN and NNS in the intelligence community understand this better , and certainly it is RB worse than it appears . . . . The fact that she set up a private server , in and of itself , means she is guilty of a felony RB there . Obviously , by having a private server , she was conspiring to evade her signed sworn statements that she MD uphold secrecy agreements . The fact that she simply established that ( private server ) regardless of what was on it , she intended to VB RB and circumvent the law . Now , we had more than 100 highly classified emails on the server , and the fact that this server is absolutely vulnerable to any Chinese , Russian or Iranian hacking , this is the greatest disaster or mishandling of classified NN at the upper levels of the U.S. NN in history . There is no question about it . ” Does Uehlinger VB NNP ’s private server was hacked ? Uehlinger VBZ , “ I MD virtually guarantee that with 95 % certainty it was hacked . There is almost no question about it . ” What about the mishandling of classified NN that General David Petraeus plead guilty to last NN ? Is this the same level of security breach ? Uehlinger VBZ , “ We do n’t VB exactly what he gave out , but there has been talk in the press that his schedule was given out . NNS of that level , RB their schedules are classified NN . We cannot RB begin to compare the damage of General Petraeus ’ schedule , which is obsolete after a week or so , compared to highly sensitive NN ( on NNP ’s private server ) that involve U.S. technical means . . . that ’s so high in classification that the FBI agents investigating her NN were not allowed to VB . This is a quantum leap in mishandling of classified NN far and above anything that Petraeus did , and look at what was done to him , and compare that to the present inaction VBG on with Hillary NNP ’s NN . ” On Iran ’s recent JJ push for ballistic missile development , Uehlinger , who is a 20 NN NNP veteran and is an expert on NNP and Iran , VBZ , “ None of this is a surprise to NNS IN us . However , this is a surprise to this administration , which just has a willful blindness and an ideology it sticks to and does n’t VB to hear anything to the contrary . They wanted to conclude something with Iran , and it was done , RB though all NN pointing to this MD be a disaster . It ’s an absolute disaster . It ’s unconscionable that you can have a non-agreement agreement and release NN seized by the international community since 1979 . . . and unfreeze that , and the Iranians have admitted they are VBG to use some of that NN for terrorist activity . They are progressing with their missile activity and threatening the NNP NNPS for daring to criticize them . . . . They are VBG to increase the chances for NN in the Middle East , not decrease it . ” Uehlinger , who is RB running to be a Republican delegate in Pennsylvania , VBZ Hillary not being charged MD be to the advantage of the GOP come November . Uehlinger explains , “ I have talked to some whose fear , their fear is that she will be charged . If this happened at the 11th hour , what might happen is Biden might be put up . I VBP NNS who have greater fear of Biden running against either Cruz or NNP than Hillary . It might be the best thing for the Republican Party for Hillary to remain where she is as a candidate because she can be defeated . ” Join Greg Hunter as he goes CD - on - CD with JJ NNP Operations Officer Scott Uehlinger .

This_DT is_VBZ the_DT future_NN in_IN a_DT world_NN of_IN climate_NN change_NN ._.","There is a strange contradiction at the heart of our federal NN and its response to NN NN . While most of NNP has been woefully neglectful of the NN or outright denying its existence , what is arguably our most conservative institution — the U.S. NN — has begun taking the NN very seriously . GOP legislators might make nonsensical statements about how “ NN level rise ” is a “ left - wing term , ” but the Pentagon is well aware of the dangers that NN NN — which it refers to as a ‘ threat multiplier ’ — poses for its installations and mission . After all , you “ ca n’t fight a NN unless you ’ve got a place to leave from , ” noted General Gerald Galloway , formerly of the Army Corps of Engineers . As JJ as 46 U.S. JJ bases were recently deemed threatened by the heightened NN of flood , drought , and wildfire brought on by NN NN . Diving into the armed forces ’ response to the NN NN , Michael T. Klare “ VBD they had some very interesting things to VB about it . ” Klare , 76 , recently retired from Hampshire College , where he was the Five College Professor Emeritus of Peace and NNP Security Studies . ( “ Well , now I work RB harder , ” he laughs . ) The author of 15 previous books and the defense correspondent for The Nation , Klare spoke with Rolling Stone about his forthcoming release , All Hell Breaking Loose : The Pentagon ’s Perspective on NNP NNP , which is due out this November from book publisher Metropolitan . The book synthesizes the latest NN papers , statements and presentations by officials , along with personal interviews , to give the most up - to - date perspective on NN as viewed through the lens of those tasked with defending NNP from threats of all types . Klare ’s project began because he was “ studying the intersections of NN NN , resource scarcity , and conflict ” and realized that the NN ’s take on JJ NN was a “ vision of NN NN that is not a part of the JJ discussion . ” While environmentalists point out the ecological issues involved , IN habitat destruction and mass extinctions , “ the NN focuses on the threat to JJ institutions and communities , ” he VBZ . The armed forces “ VBP the greatest threats from NN NN being NN collapse and mass migrations that are VBG to create chaos IN the NN ” and lead to a lot of dangerous tasks that “ they MD prefer not to have to undertake . ” The NN began making some reforms to address NN NN under the Obama administration , utilizing cleaner technologies through the Army ’s Operation Dynamo , the Marines ’ Experimental Forward Operating Base , and the Navy ’s Great Green Fleet . Obama had put through an executive order in 2013 requiring all parts of the federal NN to prepare for NN NN , but NNP rescinded it in 2017 . The various JJ branches continue to build toward ‘ net zero ‘ installations and the ability of each base to be self - reliant . “ At some point , [ JJ ] officers who view national security as a sacred obligation will have no choice but to confront those who persist in NN denial , ” writes Klare . The NN MD VB NN NN is a hoax created by the Chinese , but Klare ’s latest book shows that the Pentagon plans to stay the course in attempting to green its facilities , juggle multiple catastrophes at a NN , and prepare for the possibility of , well , all hell breaking loose . The idea of ‘ All Hell Breaking Loose , ’ in the title of your book , what does that mean for the NN ? They VBP their job as defending this country from foreign threats and that is what they are trained to do . ‘ All Hell Breaking Loose ’ is a condition they fear in which they will be unable to conduct that mission , to do their job , because they will be so caught up in protecting this country against NN NN threats or addressing its impacts on other NNS IN the NN that are collapsing because of the effects . I take this concept from the Cold NNP era of nuclear escalation that VBZ we VBP from JJ - scale events to increasingly serious ones . The NN sees that with NN NN as well . They VB an increase in extreme storm events that affect their allied NNS and require a JJ response providing aid — and in the U.S. itself , UH in Florida or Puerto Rico . But they look into the future and VBP increasingly severe events IN extreme droughts bringing about the collapse of entire nations . They VBP that happening potentially in places IN Nigeria and Pakistan , leading to mass chaos spreading across continents . They VBP that beginning in what we once called the Third NNP but spreading to more privileged and wealthier parts of the NN IN Europe , and bringing about upheaval there , leading eventually to conflict among the great powers as NN NN advances . Perhaps in the Can you quickly walk us through the ‘ Ladder of Escalation ’ model that you use for this book ? You write that the Pentagon began planning for what disaster experts call “ complex emergencies ” after the East Coast was walloped by Hurricane Sandy , and that it was the triple - assault of Hurricanes Irma , Maria , and Harvey — combined with massive wildfires in the west — that “ made the nightmare palpable ” for officials . What is a complex emergency , and what do they mean to the Pentagon ? The U.S. NNP has always played a role in the aftermath of emergencies , providing food , NN , supplies , helping rescue NNS and more . That ’s nothing JJ . But they find that as NN NN advances and increases in intensity , these emergencies will become more complex . The electrical grid will collapse . There will be chemical spills that produce all kinds of NN effects . The NN NN itself will collapse . The NN services will collapse . And so the NN will have to play a much greater role than they ever have before , stepping in and playing the various roles of governments and having to deal with lawlessness IN looting . In Puerto Rico , after Hurricane Maria , the systems of NN basically crashed in JJ places . There was no electricity or communications available and the NN came in and had to provide all of those services . There is a fear that in the future these kinds of emergencies , complex emergencies , will increase in severity and in number — and MD occur simultaneously — requiring a vast commitment of JJ forces at a NN when maybe those forces are needed elsewhere . The book talks about how NN systems will come under pressure because of NN NN , which MD give NN to conflict . Any areas we should be particularly leery about ? Places IN the NNS of northern Africa are already suffering terribly and we VBP that currently with localized conflicts . But as NN NN advances , RB bigger and more wealthy and powerful NNS will feel the effects . I VBP NN is the area where this will play itself out — NN shortages — and where CD or more NNS share the same source of NN : the Nile River , the Indus River and so on . CD that has caught my attention is the Brahmaputra River . It originates in the Himalayas and travels hundreds of NNS through NNP and Tibet and then crosses into northern India , where it continues for hundreds more NNS and then finally crosses into Bangladesh , joins with the Ganges River and empties out into the Indian Ocean . This is CD of the biggest and most important rivers in the NN for agriculture — hundreds of millions of NNS depend on it for growing their food . This river is threatened by NN NN because it derives from the Himalayian glaciers , which are VBG to disappear , and the river will likely diminish in flow . Meanwhile , NNP is threatening to dam the river upstream and divert its waters to parts of the country that are already suffering from NN scarcity . And India VBZ that that MD be a NN for NN because that river is so essential to the survival of their country that they wo n’t let it happen . So that is a scenario that worries me deeply . What are the ties between the globalization of the economy , a JJ JJ NN , and these complex emergencies ? How do those intersections potentially affect things IN pandemics ? RB of all , NN NN is making pandemics more likely because it improves the conditions for mosquitoes since they VBP hot , moist NN and that is what JJ NN is providing them with in JJ parts of the NN — including the southeastern NNP NNPS . We ’re VBG to VB more frequent pandemics in the future . Globalization helps that process due to the ease of airplane travel and whatnot — it can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases . I VBP this will create fears IN the NN , which will lead to quarantines , panics , and the militarization of NN [ services ] . We ’ve seen that at various stages in the past few NNS , IN borders being sealed off . That attitude will lead to a more militarized response to NN NN : fences , walls , and more . I do n’t VB you can solve NN NN or NN emergencies in this fashion , but I feel there will be a tendency to respond that NN . What about other aspects of globalization ? Should the migrant caravans be viewed as NN refugees , and how should the U.S. respond ? This is a major JJ issue in the NNP NNPS : How to address these massive migrations of desperate poor NNS from Central NNP who are fleeing violence and poverty and seeking refuge in the NNP NNPS . The claim is that those NNS are JJ refugees and should find refuge in an intermediate country , VB Guatemala or Mexico . But it is pretty evident that NN NN is a driving factor in their migration because of pronounced drought in much of the area . It ’s becoming impossible to grow crops there and these are agricultural regions . So , yes , these NNS are fleeing NN NN . I VBP as NN goes on this type of thing can only become a more powerful factor in NNS ’s decision to move . And there is VBG to be hostility to this process everywhere . JJ activists point out that the NN has garrisoned the NN with bases and is the largest consumer of oil as a result . Is the NN at all self - aware here ? Of course the NN is a JJ consumer of oil , and that contributes to NN NN . But this is something that NNS in the NN are very aware of . They were drawn to this topic originally not by NN NN but by the strategic implications of being all over the NN and depending on a JJ logistical trail of getting that petroleum there . And that logistical trail is very vulnerable to attack . In Afghanistan and Iraq , U.S. oil convoys were attacked all the NN . They still are . In JJ circumstances , more soldiers died defending convoys than died in battle . The NN is very determined to reduce their dependence on fuel that MD be subject to interference . It is RB at NN from NN NN because these JJ supply lines are increasingly VBG to be struck by severe NN events just IN everything else will be . So RB before they had any kind of green consciousness , JJ leaders were determined to try to reduce the oil consumption of their forces . Now they are RB concerned about NN NN ’s impacts on the JJ security environment , so they are RB trying to reduce their own contribution to JJ NN . And they ’re making some headway . Can they do more ? Yes . They can do a lot more . But I VBP that they are showing that they ’re capable of making progress in this direction . JJ NNS speak about a NNP NNP II - style mobilization to stop NN NN through a Green NNP Deal and the JJ . But what does it VB about our culture that NNS constantly VBP in these militarized analogies ? I VBP JJ NNS have difficulty with that notion , and I ’m RB ambivalent about whether a JJ metaphor is the JJ NN . NNS sometimes do speak about the Apollo Project [ the ambitious mission to VB to the NN ] , which I find a more comfortable notion of what we have to do . The U.S. NNP , when they speak about what they have to accomplish , does not speak in those terms . They VBP that ‘ we have a job to do , which is to defend this country against foreign threats ’ — very real JJ threats — ‘ and that ’s what we VBP to do . ’ But NN NN counts as an impediment to their real job and they have to address this and overcome it . And that means making its own bases resilient to NN NN and reducing their contribution to it . But they recognize it as a JJ problem and realize they cannot do it alone and have to cooperate with the militaries of other NNS in making their own NNS resilient . So they VBP this as an area of JJ - to - JJ cooperation . I VBP it in a more positive light in that sense . The now - retired Navy Admiral David Titley has mentioned a fear of ‘ ungoverned spaces ’ — why are such NN vacuums abroad so important to the NN and to the domestic security apparatus here at home ? The NN talks about ‘ ungoverned spaces ’ as places where NN NN has vanished . You can VB about a place IN Somalia where you once had a functioning NN that extended throughout the country but has RB - since disappeared . You have something that calls itself a ‘ NN . ’ Its reach does n’t extend much beyond the city limits of Mogadishu . The rest of the country is pretty much ungoverned and you have lots of contending forces — various terrorist groups IN NNP - Shabab , militias and more . These are areas where groups VBP that can flourish and hatch plots against the NNP NNPS . Will this occur here ? Certainly senior JJ officials in the U.S. fear that in the event of mass JJ catastrophes in the future , local governments will break down and there will be lawlessness in this country and the NN will be forced to step in . They saw elements of that with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in NNP Orleans where the NN force basically disintegrated and vanished . The NN VBZ that with NN NN , the number of these ungoverned spaces is VBG to multiply because NNS in Africa and elsewhere will not be able to cope with the intense droughts that can lead to mass suffering and starvation , combined with severe NN events , food scarcity , NN scarcity and so on . They ’re just VBG to collapse under the weight of these pressures , which opens vast areas of the country to militia rule and terrorist infiltration . We VBP this in Libya , Mali , parts of Nigeria , and , of course , in Afghanistan . This is the future in a NN of NN NN ."

The cloud creates a barrier that reflects sunlight back into NN , keeping it from being absorbed on NNP , where it MD further warm the NN . The planes do this every day , as they have for NNS .

Magnus Söderlund is a behavioral scientist at Stockholm School of Economics in Stockholm , Sweden . He describes himself in his profile on ResarchGate as “ Professor of Marketing and Head of Center for Consumer Marketing at Stockholm School of Economics . Magnus does research in consumer behavior - related areas , often with experimental methods , and with an interest in how consumers are affected by various marketing activities . ” On September 3 , 2019 , at the Gastro Summit on food of the future in Stockholm , Söderlund conducted a powerpoint presentation titled “ Can you Imagine Eating JJ Flesh ? , ” in which he VBD we must “ awaken the idea ” of eating JJ flesh in the future , as a NN of combatting the effects of NN NN . The “ Gastro Summit – about the future of food ” is being held at the Stockholm Fair . There , behavioral scientist Magnus Söderlund holds seminars that make most NNS raise their eyebrows . They are about the possibility of eating JJ flesh – to save the NN . Swedish - JJ writer / reporter Celia Farber reports for The Epoch Times that Söderlund argued that since food sources will be scarce in the future , NNS must break down the ancient taboos against desecrating the JJ corpse and eating JJ flesh , and be introduced to eating things they have thus far considered disgusting–among them , JJ flesh . He called the taboos against cannibalism “ conservative ” and NNS ’s resistance to it as a problem that MD be overcome , little by little , beginning with persuading NNS to eat worms and insects , then to tasting JJ flesh . In his talk at the Gastro Summit , Söderlund asked the audience how JJ MD be open to the idea of cannibalism . Not JJ hands went up ; some in the audience groaned .

Sign_VB up_RP here_RB ._.","NNP Explained is a collaboration between The Conversation , Stuff and the NNP Zealand NNP NNP Centre to answer your questions about NN NN . If you have a question you ’d VB an expert to answer , please send it to climate.change@stuff.co.nz As someone who has been working on NN NN detection and its causes for over 20 NNS I was both surprised and not surprised that I was asked to write on this topic by The Conversation . For nearly all NN NNS , the NN is proven that NNS are the overwhelming NN of the JJ - term NNS in the NN that we are observing . And that this NN should be closed . Despite this , NN denialists continue to receive prominence in some NN which can lead NNS into thinking that man-made NN NN is still in question . So it ’s worth VBG back over the NN to remind ourselves just how much has already been established . Successive reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP – mandated by the NNP Nations to assess scientific NN on NN NN – have evaluated the causes of NN NN . The most recent special report on JJ NN of 1.5 degrees confirms that the observed NNS in JJ and regional NN over the last 50 or so NNS are almost entirely due to JJ influence on the NN NN and not due to natural causes . RB we should perhaps ask what we mean by NN NN . The Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP defines NN NN as : The causes of NN NN can be any combination of : • None Internal variability in the NN NN , when various components of the NN NN – IN the atmosphere and ocean – vary on their own to VB fluctuations in climatic conditions , such as NN or rainfall . These internally - driven NNS generally happen over decades or longer ; shorter variations such as those related to El Niño fall in the bracket of NN variability , not NN NN . • None Natural external causes such as increases or decreases in volcanic activity or solar radiation . For example , every 11 NNS or so , the NNP ’s magnetic field completely flips and this can VB JJ fluctuations in JJ NN , up to about 0.2 degrees . On longer NN scales – tens to hundreds of millions of NNS – geological processes can drive NNS in the NN , due to shifting continents and mountain building . • None JJ influence through NN gases ( gases that trap heat in the atmosphere such as NN dioxide and methane ) , other particles released into the air ( which absorb or reflect sunlight such as soot and aerosols ) and land - use NN ( which affects how much sunlight is absorbed on land surfaces and RB how much NN dioxide and methane is absorbed and released by vegetation and soils ) . What NNS have been detected ? The Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ’s recent report showed that , on average , the JJ NN air NN has risen by 1 °C since the beginning of significant industrialisation ( which roughly started in the 1850s ) . And it is increasing at ever faster rates , currently 0.2 °C per decade , because the concentrations of NN gases in the atmosphere have themselves been increasing ever faster . The oceans are VBG as well . In fact , about 90 % of the extra heat trapped in the atmosphere by NN gases is being absorbed by the oceans . A warmer atmosphere and oceans are causing dramatic NNS , including steep decreases in Arctic summer NN NN which is profoundly impacting arctic marine ecosystems , increasing NN level rise which is inundating low lying coastal areas such as Pacific island atolls , and an increasing frequency of JJ NN extremes such as drought and heavy rain , as well as disasters where NN is an important driver , such as wildfire , flooding and landslides . Multiple lines of NN , VBG JJ methods , show that JJ influence is the only plausible explanation for the patterns and magnitude of NNS that have been detected . This JJ influence is largely due to our activities that release NN gases , such as NN dioxide and methane , as well sunlight absorbing soot . The main sources of these NN gases and particles are fossil fuel burning , cement production , land cover NN ( especially deforestation ) and agriculture . Most of us will struggle to pick up slow NNS in the NN . We feel NN NN largely through how it affects NN from day - to - day , season - to - season and NN - to - NN . The NN we experience arises from dynamic processes in the atmosphere , and interactions between the atmosphere , the oceans and the land NN . JJ influence on the broader NN NN acts on these processes so that the NN today is JJ in JJ ways from how it MD have been . CD NN we can more clearly VB NN NN is by looking at severe NN events . A branch of NN NN , called extreme event or NN attribution , looks at memorable NN events and estimates the extent of JJ influence on the severity of these events . It uses NN models run with and without measured NN gases to estimate how individual NN events MD have been JJ in a NN without NN NN . As of early 2019 , nearly 70 % of NN events that have been assessed in this NN were shown to have had their likelihood and / or magnitude increased by JJ influence on NN . In a NN without JJ NN , these events MD have been less severe . Some CD % of the studies showed a reduction in likelihood , while for the remaining 20 % JJ NN has not had a discernible effect . For example , CD NN showed that JJ influence on NN had increased the likelihood of the 2015 - 2018 drought that afflicted Cape Town in South Africa by a factor of three . NN extremes underlie JJ of the hazards that damage society and the natural environment we depend upon . As JJ NN has progressed , so have the frequency and intensity of these hazards , and the damage they VBP . Minimising the impacts of these hazards , and having mechanisms in place to recover quickly from the impacts , is the aim of NN NN , as recently reported by the NNP Commission on NNP . As the Commission explains , investing in NN makes sense from JJ , JJ and ethical perspectives . And as we VBP that NN NN is caused by NNS , society cannot use “ lack of NN ” on its NN as an excuse for inaction any more .

RB proposed in 2008 to initiate a comprehensive NN plan to combat NN NN in the UK , the Green NNP Deal ( GND ) has come to JJ attention , gaining particular traction in North NNP . Its vision goes beyond the "" green , "" "" hip , "" "" vegan , "" and "" mindful "" lifestyle choices of a burgeoning elite JJ class or the tried and failed policies of NN - offsetting , cap and trade , and sustainable development of green capitalism . It proposes definitive steps to VB combat impending NN crises and to give the younger generation hope in the face of rapidly accelerating socio-ecological breakdown and unprecedented inequality . It puts forward a plan to shift the economy away from fossil fuels towards renewable NN ; to eliminate polluting practices in industrial production ; to provide affordable housing for all , free education and NN care ; to create jobs with dignified working conditions and security , and to promote racial , gender and socio-economic equity and justice . But for the GND to work and , indeed , transform the economy and our lives , it must be decolonial . This means , its application must VB hand in hand with a concerted effort to rethink relationships to land , labour , and our collective imaginaries from the structural and historic injustices of Western - style development . The understanding that development policies and ideas rooted in European and North JJ notions of "" progress "" are destructive and exploitative by their nature must be at the heart of the GND . In seeking to build a JJ economy and another NN of relating to the environment IN us , we must heed the advice of indigenous NNS , in their historical and ongoing demands for cultural autonomy and self - determination , on the NN to restore a diversity of relationships with our environment . What does it mean to be ' green ' ? The GND is meant to halt the loss of biodiversity , the degradation of soils , NN , and rapidly decelerate JJ NN to pre-empt further the catastrophic impacts of NN NN that a failure to stay below CD degrees of NN will bring . To achieve all these things , however , technological fixes , such as NN capture and storage , bound to NN economy forces cannot be the solution . The relationships we must develop with our living environment cannot depend on policies regulated by costly , unpredictable and NN - driven accounting metrics , which defy the speed and severity of the JJ and NN shifts we are experiencing . While all efforts to put the "" emergency brake "" on ecological degradation are needed , we must recognise the roots of how today 's custodianship and caretaking of land and waters was established and how it is linked to Western notions of development . Our development trajectory has been marred by the idea that NNS are the overlords of the NN , who have to tame nature and submit it to exploitation for their exclusive benefit . It implies that JJ civilisation is somehow separate from nature , whose only role is to provide unlimited resources to feed and expand the JJ material NN . The separation between humanity and nature is RB implied in how environmentalism has been approached in Western societies . It implies that JJ degradation is merely a symptom of bad management in an otherwise non-negotiable JJ development model . The arrogance of this logic is deeply embedded in the mechanisms adopted by the international community to respond to JJ and ecological crises , including its sustainability policies . As RB as we erroneously VBP ourselves as outside and above the rest of the living NN , we will continue to contribute to its destruction . A decolonial GND , therefore , requires repositioning ourselves vis -à - vis nature as an integral part of it - just as JJ indigenous peoples have consistently sought to do in their historical and ongoing struggle for cultural autonomy and self - determination . GND policies must not simply aim to rectify harmful JJ activity that destroys biodiversity , soil fertility , and NN gas pollution but engender a completely JJ approach to producing food , building JJ settlements and meeting JJ needs . Under a decolonial GND , agricultural practices , for example , will have to be completely overhauled . Mass production and distribution will have to be phased out , as should the current practices of optimising yields through monoculture farming . Instead , transitions are required that focus on regenerative agricultural practices to return nutrients to soils ; encourage and recognise NN passed down between generations farming the land ; ensure healthy non-GMO food production that is affordable to all ; and rebuild relationships between producers and consumers . What is so ' JJ ' about it ? The GND must RB adopt a completely JJ approach to the JJ economy . RB , it must recognise that the crises produced by capitalism cannot be solved by capitalism itself . Capitalism , much IN the burning of fossil fuels which feeds it , should rather be phased out and replaced with a diversity of decentralised solidarity economies that put JJ justice and both individual and collective welfare at the core of their mission . A GND can therefore only be "" JJ "" if it is premised upon a commitment to limiting and redistributing wealth , is oriented towards understanding well - being as sufficiency rather than ceaseless desires and ensures that the means of production are re-localised to transfer decision - making NN to communities at the frontlines of resource extraction . Second , any GND for the NNP North must embrace degrowth , which means scaling down overall material consumption and NN use rather than simply making them more efficient , which MD still expand growth and enable further extraction . It RB means moving society away from wealth accumulation and expansion as a goal in itself and towards wealth distribution and JJ justice . In this sense , changing PRP 's lifestyle choices - buying "" green "" and eating vegan or organic food - is not a solution to JJ and JJ justice problems . Rather NNS require support systems to radically alter the NN they live and consume . These support systems might involve fostering conditions of solidarity , connection , and joy that are otherwise sapped from the individuality of materialism masquerading as "" happiness "" . Doing so means that learning to live with what is enough to provide for basic needs and good NN should not be seen as a sacrifice , but as something to gain . This is the JJ step to building a society for everyone , radically JJ than the NN we have now that favours the pursuit of self - enrichment and indulgence . Third , the GND must RB create the conditions for poorer NNS to develop according to their own democratically chosen development path . For that to happen , degrowth policies have to be coupled with decolonisation of the JJ economy . Although the age of colonialism is supposedly over , colonial dynamics still very much dominate relations between the "" developed "" and the "" developing "" and determine hegemonic patterns of production and consumption . If the GND does not address the uneven patterns of where production and consumption take place then it threatens to derail "" green "" or NN - efficient transformations in the JJ South . For example , if the shift to renewable NN is carried out without a parallel decolonisation of trade relations , then NNS IN Bolivia and the Democratic Republic of Congo , rich in coltan , lithium , antimony , nickel and other materials VBN in green technologies , MD still face the dangers of extractivism . RB if measures are taken to ensure that renewable NN production does not contaminate and deplete NN , destroy habitats , and displace communities - hardly likely in any JJ model predicated on optimising outcomes while minimising costs - unequal JJ relations MD doom these NNS to a JJ form of domination VBN as "" green colonialism "" . A decolonial GND must therefore prioritise restructuring JJ trade relations and reversing the enormous imbalances of cultural , JJ and JJ NN between Western governments and the JJ South . When the prefixes of "" green "" and "" JJ "" are removed , we are left with "" deal "" . This requires understanding what the current "" deal "" is and why it must be fundamentally restructured . Apart from embracing workers ' rights and progressive JJ policies , a decolonial GND must RB actively interrogate the racial , gender and class supremacies which have ruled the NN and extracted wealth for the benefit of a privileged minority for centuries . This is because , the ongoing and increasingly dire ecological collapse is very much the result of a perverse "" JJ contract "" in which patriarchy , capitalism and white supremacy shape JJ behaviour . We live in a NN where black , brown , feminine , queer and working - class bodies have faced unthinkable acts of violent dehumanisation under the banner of contemporary Western development . This NN of making and shaping the NN and its inhabitants has not gone away with the introduction of symbolic laws forbidding discrimination . It remains fundamental to the socio- JJ relations which dominate our lives and which tie ecological destruction and racialised cheap labour to the maintenance of uneven relations of trade across the NN . Take historical plantations as an example . The production of commodities IN sugar and cotton involved both the brutal enslavement of NNS and the ruthless abuse of the environment , which led to severe deforestation , soil erosion and habitat destruction . The goods extracted through violent exploitation of both NNS and nature were then sold for the benefit of wealthy white settler colonialists . This plantation model has not fundamentally changed since slavery was officially abolished . It has rather become more sophisticated with the liberalisation of the economy and the advent of digital technology which today ensures greater predictability and NN in yields , labour hours and profits . Today , agriculture and other sectors IN the NN are still dependent on a largely racialised and marginalised labour force , coerced in myriad ways to accept harsh working conditions . And again the outcomes are the same : destruction of the environment and ever - burgeoning profit for a select few . A decolonial GND must break the bonds of the plantation model of JJ relations by introducing a JJ "" JJ contract "" rooted in ethical and JJ commitment to JJ , racial and gender justice . It must seek to establish a completely JJ set of rules for socio- JJ relations in our society - CD VBN on acceptance , respect for JJ NN and dignity , solidarity , and equity . Under a decolonial GND , temporary , underpaid employment will be discontinued . Job creation will be generated by the JJ transformation away from fossil fuels and overexploitation of resources and towards worker - owned renewable NN and the relocalisation of industry that puts collective interests over individual ones . Jobs will have to pay enough for the employee to sustain a dignified NN ; they will have to provide JJ security and desirable working conditions that are free of abuse and discrimination and stimulate creativity . Worker - owned cooperatives MD be CD model to follow to create jobs and provide various community services , from NN care and NN care to recycling and security . However , this will only work if cooperatives are themselves embedded in globally decolonised economies geared towards responsible relations between NNS and the land . A decolonial GND must RB recognise and seek to compensate for the ills that centuries of racial , gender and JJ oppression have produced . It must , therefore , pay special attention to historically marginalised groups and indigenous communities dispossessed of their lands and ways of knowing and being . As part of this transformation , it should RB make provisions for reparations for colonial injustices . Thus , I suggest three organising principles for a decolonial GND : 1 ) "" VBG green "" must rethink and experiment in alternative JJ relationships to each other and to non-humans , rooted in reciprocity and responsibility . 2 ) The NN economy must be reoriented towards principles of degrowth , decolonisation and relocalisation 3 ) The unequal NN relations underlying the "" JJ contract "" of Western development models must be democratised to eliminate discrimination and racial supremacy in all its forms . For a GND to work however , it can not be limited to discussions and NN within the borders of a single country or region . The dehumanising and ecologically destructive forces of capitalism have proven to adhere to no borders , so any response strategies under a GND must have a JJ scope . A GND requires collective commitment to resist oppressive forces that are literally waging a NN against a good NN for all . This means JJ resistance and NN in the streets , each in their own NN responding to the induced austerity policies of NN and NN that together reinforce the "" JJ contract "" responsible for ecological collapse . At the same NN , "" decolonial "" cannot be another prefix to tack on along with "" green "" and "" JJ "" to make a status - quo development "" deal "" appear more inclusive . It must recognise both the JJ NN of Western development models in organising NNS and nature in violent ways , but RB more regional and historically - specific variants . These MD include the subjugation of NNS and their relationships to the land in places IN Kashmir or West Papua and the rising demonisation of indigenous worldviews in Brazil and Bolivia . A decolonial GND requires constant learning , building mutual consent and trust , and self - reflection of the embedded thought processes and habitus patterns that we all hold in contributing to such oppression , whether we realise it or not . We have reached a point of no return and we must realise that there is no saviour and no quick - fix solution for the NN catastrophe we currently face . While the "" mess "" we are in was not created by all of humanity equally ( and we must recognise this ! ) , it is a "" mess "" of such proportions that we VBP committed and unconditional solidarity to VB ourselves out of it .

( Lauren Radack / San Diego Gas & Electric via AP ) NNP NNP ( AP ) — As JJ NNS creep higher and the NN of deadly wildfires grows , utilities in the West are struggling to respond to the threat . San Diego Gas & Electric was ahead of the curve when it began strengthening its wildfire prediction and electricity distribution systems a decade ago . At the NN , some of its decisions were unpopular . But now , while its northern neighbor Pacific Gas & Electric confronts a so - called NN NN bankruptcy after its equipment sparked the deadliest wildfire in NN history , the Southern California NN is viewed as a model for how utilities as far - flung as Australia can prepare for the worst impacts of NN NN . SDG&E invested $ 1.5 CD over a decade swapping wood poles for steel , hiring meteorologists , deploying helicopters with infrared inspection capabilities and building a sophisticated NN monitoring NN with mountaintop cameras and about 200 stations which capture 200,000 NN - related NN points daily . Caroline Winn , chief operating officer , was at SDG&E when its equipment sparked a deadly wildfire in 2007 , and she was CD of thousands to evacuate her home . She reflected on how the NN ’s culture changed after the disaster and how executives ’ attitudes about the role NN NNS play in NN NN has shifted dramatically . The conversation has been edited for clarity and length . Q : What prompted San Diego Gas & Electric to invest so heavily in overhauling its operations to reduce the NN of wildfires ? A : Our journey began over a decade ago when the San Diego region RB experienced the unprecedented levels of destruction from firestorms in October of 2007 . Those fires were among the most destructive in California history at that NN . Unfortunately , there were lives lost and there were hundreds of structures , including those that belong to our employees , that were damaged or lost , and RB 500,000 acres were scorched . On that day , we knew that the National NNP Service had called for a red flag event , but that ’s about all we knew . So when the fires broke out , we were RB in a reactive mode . It affected so JJ of us in this NN on such a personal level that ... keeping our infrastructure from causing any fires became this rallying call across the NN . We RB shifted from being focused on keeping the lights on — because that was RB our main focus — to the most important attribute becoming keeping our communities safe . There was n’t a prescriptive plan that existed in terms of how we should design , engineer , construct or maintain our infrastructure against the increasing threat of violent fires . There was n’t a blueprint on how to develop and build out what MD become CD of our largest utility - owned NN networks . Back in 2007 the belief in NN NN was n’t what it is today . But CD thing was RB clear to us : we experienced NN conditions that we had never experienced in previous decades . Q : Your NN began proactively shutting off the NN to reduce wildfire risks in 2013 . How did customers react initially and how was that changed ? A : It was RB met with fierce opposition from the NN . We were the JJ utility to do this and NNS did n’t understand why we had to turn off the NN for JJ safety . Despite the harsh criticism , we stayed the course . We held town halls after the shutoff so that the community MD understand the type of conditions we were experiencing . But RB it was important for us to listen to what our customers needed during these types of experiences . Acceptance of the NN shut - offs is significantly better than it was in 2013 . We VBP very few complaints because I VBP they understand why we do it , and how we do it , in that our goal is RB to keep our communities safe . Q : How does SDG&E VB NNS with limited financial resources tolerate blackouts ? A : We have partnered with the food banks and Meals on Wheels so they ’re able to provide necessities to the more vulnerable customers , whether they ’re income - qualifying customers or they have mobility issues or they ’re seniors . We RB , since 2007 , grew deep relationships with these organizations because that is our NN to VB every customer through these situations . Q : What are the most important things utilities must do to prepare for NN NN ? A : I VBP about it in terms of our efforts to reduce NN gas NNS . We ’ve installed over 3,000 electric vehicle charging stations in areas that do n’t have as much access to electric vehicle charging ... and 45 % of our electricity that we provide to customers comes from the NN and the wind . NN NN is impacting the wildfire threat , but RB the CO2 ( NN dioxide ) and NNS of wildfires are tremendous . So if we can VB a chance of ensuring that these wildfires , if they happen , stay JJ and that utility infrastructure is not the NN of it , then we RB feel that we are leaning in ... and we ’re adapting very aggressively and progressively ."

No doubt , Netanyahu will warn a deal that will eventually allow Iran to VB nuclear weapons will VB JJ problems for the NN . There has been increasing friction and drama with NNP Obama over this address . All the drama surrounding Benjamin Netanyahu ’s address to Congress can only mean CD thing — negotiations with the U.S. and Iran to curtail its program are not VBG well . Likely , there will be , once again , no deal at the end of the current deadline , which is the end of next month . Some Democrats are threatening to boycott the address , and members of the NNP ’s staff have clearly VBN they are not happy with Congress for inviting the Israeli Prime Minister . I predict this will be resolved CD NN or another this NN . Another top NATO general is , once again , warning about increased possibilities of NN with NNP . The most recent ceasefire was broken not RB after it was instituted , and now there is no end to the fighting in sight . In the Middle East , it looks IN plans are being made to try to attack the Islamic NNP , or ISIS , in Iraq . Some 25,000 regional troops are being prepared to try to take back Mosul , which is the second biggest city in Iraq . The U.S. is not supplying troops for the assault , only JJ trainers . The U.S. will supply air NN , but a few weeks ago , JJ JJ experts VBD it MD take RB 80,000 top quality troops to defeat ISIS . The operation is planned for the spring of this NN . The Federal Reserve is adamantly against any sort of audit . Fed Chief Janet Yellen thinks the Central bank needs its independence , which some call total secrecy and non-transparent monetary policy . When asked to provide NN about a recent meeting with the White NNP and the Treasury , Yellen VBD they were “ private CD - on - CD meetings ” and releasing any NN as to what was talked about MD , according to Yellen , not be “ appropriate . ” The Federal Reserve is not federal and is , in fact , a cartel of private banks . Finally , there is record snowfall and record cold NNS this winter . I VBP this makes it a tough sell for the NN -made JJ NN proponents . The facts VBP the NN is getting colder , and not warmer .

Helen Mountford of the NNP Resources Institute VBD that post - recession economies can VB a surge in NNS : "" After the JJ financial NN of 2008 , for example , JJ CO2 NNS from fossil fuel combustion and cement production , more than offsetting the 1.4 percent decrease in 2009 . "" This NN , she hopes “ low - NN and resilient infrastructure ” MD be a priority in any stimulus package to avoid an uptick in NNS as economies recover . Here are factors that MD VB and hurt the NN , in both the short and longer terms : Improvements in air quality : Hubei province , NNP has been the JJ winner . Marshall Burke , a researcher at Stanford NNP , calculated that the improvements in air quality recorded in NNP MD have saved the lives of 4,000 NNS under 5 NNS old and 73,000 adults over 70 . . Better air is saving more NNS than NN is killing , in other words . Traffic is down in some of Europe ’s dirtiest cities , which have chronically failed to respect EU air quality limits . Industry shut - downs reduce NNS : A NN by specialist outlet NNP Brief VBD that in NNP , NN dioxide NNS have fallen by RB 25 percent , and declining oil demand should push NNS down globally . Airlines are RB cutting flights . Beware : If passengers are flying on half - empty planes , fewer flyers does not equal fewer NNS . Minds MD open for structural NN : The focus is on NN and supply chains RB now . But the process of challenging assumptions and fundamentally altering behavior — illustrated by remote work — can be seized on by NN NN advocates once the worst of this NN NN is over . JJ financial institutions will push green stimulus : Green investment is a pet interest of Kristalina Georgieva ( International Monetary Fund head ) and Christine Lagarde ( European Central Bank NN ) , while the European Investment Bank is already getting out of coal . Look for regional and JJ bodies to push green investment incentives . Low oil prices make it harder for the dirtiest oil to compete , and easier to cut subsidies : Oil prices are at four - NN lows thanks to the collapse of the OPEC + oil cartel , as NNP seeks to drive JJ oil shale producers out of the NN ( it MD prove too expensive for shale NNS to extract their oil in a low - NN environment ) . Meanwhile , governments reluctant to cut for car fuel and heating oil , can now do so with less JJ NN . FOUR WAYS CORONA WILL HURT THE ENVIRONMENT : JJ and financial capital will be diverted : Governments will be forced to prioritize JJ NN and struggling banks MD VB lending criteria , and use the NN to revise their green targets . Mountains of waste : Coffee chain Starbucks to stop accepting reusable cups from its customers — now it ’s only serving drinks in disposable single - use cups that are recyclable . NNP is drowning under JJ waste ( often single - use items by necessity ) produced by hospitals . In the city of Wuhan , it ’s to more than 200 tons a day . Home NN use will VB up : With oil prices down , more NNS working from home and JJ transport a place where NN spreads , consumer NN use will VB up . Take demand for home entertainment : Germany ’s Deutsche Commercial Internet Exchange interconnection platform , or , reported a record throughput of NNS this week . Low profits reduce what a NN can invest in risky and JJ - term bets . Regulation MD force a shift to clean NN , but that ’s unlikely in the NNP NNPS and NNP in a NN when the industry is suffering financial losses . EUROPE AND CANADA STICK TO THE GREEN SCRIPT … MOSTLY : Canadian Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson VBD reporters Tuesday that he expects NN NN to remain a central focus of the 2020 Canadian budget , despite the NN for emergency NN measures . "" Canadians RB VBD us that NN is a huge priority and that will be reflected when we VBP the budget , "" he VBD . On Tuesday , the U.K. NN gave electric cars and NN capture a boost in its 2020 budget . In Brussels , the European Parliament chose to delay a NN law debate .

The NN and stories that matter , delivered weekday mornings . Catch a glimpse of Katy Ayers paddling her canoe on a Nebraska lake this summer and you might do a double take . At JJ glance , her 8 - NN vessel looks much IN any other canoe — same oblong shape , same pointed ends , same ability to float on NN . But upon closer inspection , it ’s clearly anything but ordinary : Ayers ’ canoe is made out of mushrooms . More specifically , her boat is made from mycelium , the dense , fibrous roots of the mushroom that typically live beneath the soil . Ayers , 28 , a student at Central Community College in Columbus , Nebraska , RB gave her creation a fitting name : “ Myconoe . ” Though Ayers has taken the canoe out for several quasi- recreational excursions — and plans to do so again as soon as the NN warms up in the rural part of Nebraska where she lives — her real goal with the eye - catching project is to raise broader awareness about mushrooms . She is part of a growing movement of mushroom advocates , NNS who VBP these squishy , sometimes edible fungi can VB solve some of our most pressing JJ problems . In addition to their ability to break down harmful pollutants and chemicals , Ayers pointed out that mushrooms can be VBN for everything from household insulation to furniture to packaging , replacing plastics , Styrofoam and other materials that are hard to recycle and harmful to the environment . “ Mushrooms are here to VB us — they ’re a gift , ” Ayers VBD . “ There ’s so much we can do with them beyond just food ; it ’s so limitless . They ’re our biggest ally for helping the environment . ” Mushrooms are n't exactly mainstream , though citizen NNS IN Ayers and some private NNS hope to someday VB that . The NNP NNP - VBN biotech NN Ecovative Design , for instance , has made headlines for its mushroom - VBN packaging material , which has been deployed by NNS such as Ikea and Dell . Mushrooms are being VBN at the local level to VB clean up toxic debris and contaminated soil — a process VBN as mycoremediation — but so far have not been adopted on a larger scale . Ayers never paid much attention to mushrooms until she enrolled in 2018 at the college in Columbus , a JJ city with RB 23,000 residents . During her JJ semester , an English instructor challenged students to find and VB a potential solution to NN NN . During her research , Ayers came across a 2013 documentary called “ Super Fungi , ” which made the NN for mushrooms as an JJ ally and highlighted some of their innovative uses . Ayers was sold on the NN of mushrooms instantly . Having learned that mycelium is buoyant and waterproof , she decided to try VBG it to create a boat . “ I always have very JJ ideas , ” she VBD . “ So I VBP something and it ’s JJ and I just VBP to make it bigger and better . Since I ’m from Nebraska , I love to fish . I ’ve always wanted a boat . Why not just grow it ? ” With a mini -grant from the college , Ayers got to work . She reached out to a mushroom NN in nearby Grand Island for NN , sharing her idea with owner Ash Gordon . He agreed to VB immediately and offered her a summer internship so she MD learn the ins and outs of fungi . During the day , Ayers worked alongside Gordon at Nebraska Mushroom , doing lab work , creating spawn and harvesting , packaging and processing mushrooms . After finishing their work for the day , the CD turned their attention to the canoe project . They RB built a wooden skeleton and a hammock - JJ structure to suspend the boat - shaped form in the air . They next sandwiched the boat ’s skeleton with mushroom spawn and let nature take over . For CD weeks , the fledgling canoe hung inside a special growing room in Gordon ’s facility , where NNS ranged between 80 and 90 degrees and the humidity hovered between 90 to 100 percent . The last step in the process was to let the 100 - pound boat dry in the Nebraska NN . All VBN , Ayers VBD she spent $ 500 on spawn , tools and equipment to build the canoe . Ayers , who displayed her “ Myconoe ” at the 2019 Nebraska NNP Fair , has taken the canoe out for three test floats , including CD in which CD NNS comfortably sat inside . The boat is still alive , which means it fruits — grows mushrooms — each NN they take it out for a paddle . The successful mycelium canoe inspired Ayers and Gordon to experiment with making chairs , landscaping bricks and other items . Though it started as a hands - on learning opportunity for Ayers in the course of her collegiate studies , the canoe has RB served as a quirky conduit for conversations about mushrooms . “ It ’s not just a piece of art , this is a functioning boat that works , ” Gordon , 39 , VBD . “ It RB helps bridge that gap between NNS who did n’t have an interest in mushrooms — maybe they do n’t VB to eat mushrooms and RB have n’t thought about other potential uses for them . The boat gave them something to look at and VB about . ” Now Ayers is sharing her newfound fungi fabrication NN with other students at the community college . She ’s part of Growing Pathways to STEM , a full - ride scholarship program funded by the National NNP Foundation that aims to VB low - income and underserved undergraduates studying NN , technology , engineering and math . Ayers is leading CD of the cohort ’s main research projects : building bee hotels , JJ structures RB called nests or homes , from mycelium . Inspired by research from NNP NNP NNP , which VBD that honeybees who consumed mycelium extract had lower levels of a harmful NN , Ayers and her classmates hope to better understand the effects of mycelium on Nebraska ’s solitary bees . Though the community college closed all campus buildings in early April to prevent the spread of the NN , Ayers is keeping the project alive in her basement while taking JJ classes . In addition to her full - NN course load , Ayers works as the community college ’s sustainability intern , keeping tabs on NN use across the community college NN ’s seven campuses and centers . The internship , which Ayers has RB been able to continue remotely , and self - led mushroom research projects are just the start : After graduating with an associate ’s degree in NN , Ayers plans to earn a bachelor ’s degree in biology and , later , a doctorate in mycology . And after that ? Save the NN . “ She has an innate desire to VB the NN , ” VBD Lauren Gillespie , a biological sciences instructor at Central Community College and Ayers ’ adviser . “ She believes that she can do it , and I VBP that she can do it . ”"

Roche VBZ it MD ultimately make it attractive for the NN to develop treatments for diseases IN malaria . And AbbVie VBZ extreme NN events might boost its immunology NNS . But the potential risks of NN NN — and the attendant increase in natural disasters — stand to outstrip any of those incremental gains , as the NNS described in recent NN assessment reports to the British nonprofit CDP . Hurricanes and superstorms , NN outages and flooding all threaten manufacturing facilities and research sites , particularly when animals are involved . Droughts , too , threaten critical NN supplies . Forest fires , RB if remote from a given plant or research facility , bring smoke and air pollution that can similarly disrupt the day - to - day work for drug makers and their supply chain . Geography does n’t VB , either . The biotech and pharmaceutical industries — concentrated , as they are , in coastal areas IN Boston , NNP Jersey , and California — MD face higher risks for extreme NN events . STAT surveyed the NN assessment plans for more than a dozen major pharmaceutical NNS and spoke with officials at labs that survived extreme NN events and others who are planning to avoid their repercussions . All emphasized that the risks are already real — and underscored how hard the industry is working to prepare to meet the challenge . “ You RB start to VB to ask yourself and sort of reverse - engineer — what are you at NN to , what can you tolerate as a community , as an asset or a structure , ” VBD William Sweet , an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , speaking specifically about the impact of RB a JJ rise in NN level in places prone to flooding . “ Vulnerabilities that are exposed by today ’s events , it ’s important to document because those likely are VBG to be the same area that VBP exposed and are vulnerable . ” In the last five NNS alone , extreme NN has caused massive disruptions in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries . Hurricanes and flooding can wipe out research and manufacturing facilities , smoke and air pollution from forest fires threaten experiments and lab animals — as do frigid NNS and NN outages . And the gradual rise in average NNS have some concerned that plants and animals that serve as sources of existing and potential JJ drugs MD vanish . Pfizer , for example , estimates it lost $ 195 CD in inventory and overhead when three Puerto Rico manufacturing facilities were wiped out by the recent devastating hurricane season . Eli Lilly ran its Puerto Rico facility with emergency diesel generators “ for months ” after the storm . For some , Hurricane Maria was a wake - up call . To AstraZeneca , the storm “ showed the site was not resilient enough . ” The NN is planning to invest more in weatherproof buildings “ for current and future conditions . ” AbbVie spent a few thousand dollars securing the roofs on its manufacturing plants on the island . Wildfires , too , can have an extreme impact — RB if they occur further afield . For more than a week in November , wildfires in California sent enough JJ particles into the air that it became “ unhealthy ” for residents to breathe without filters — and MD have damaged the air filters that research labs do use . “ The R&D that fuels innovative activity in NN sciences NNS requires conditions that are tightly controlled , particularly when it comes to air quality , NN , and other NN settings , ” VBD Will Zasadny , the California NNP Sciences Association ’s communications director . In addition to issues IN the NN grid and the impact the fires had on employees , he VBD , “ wildfire smoke is damaging on air filtration systems . ” Recent experiences at CD research facilities — CD in NNP NNP and CD in Texas — RB VBP illustrate the potential pitfalls for earlier - stage NN NN research — as well as the promise for facilities that prepare for extreme NN in advance . When Hurricane Sandy hit NNP NNP City in 2012 , some of the facilities at NYU Langone , an academic JJ center with a hospital and research facilities , flooded and lost NN — including CD of its animal care facilities . As some NNS carried out NN - sensitive samples in bins filled with dry NN , others delivered NN to the center ’s aquariums and evacuated the mice and rats that they MD . Not all of the research animals made it out . According to a National Academies of NNP report on disaster resilience , 35,000 mice — which represented about $ 25 CD and about CD - third of the NN ’s total mouse population — died . “ In a NN , the NN are the ones who lost , ” VBD Jennifer Pullium , the director of NYU Langone ’s division of laboratory animal resources . “ The purpose of these animals is for biomedical research — to improve the quality of NN and NN of NNS . When progress is set back , progress for NNS is set back . ” IN JJ places affected by a disaster , NYU Langone planned to rebuild itself without the same soft spots . That meant installing JJ flood barricades and moving critical things IN generators and computers up to higher floors — but RB making non-flood related modifications , IN making sure the NN ’s hospitals had air conditioners hooked up to the emergency NN network . “ Something IN [ Sandy ] RB does VB crystallize and motivate a lot of NN and a lot of thinking that MD n’t happen otherwise , ” VBD Paul Schwabacher , NYU Langone ’s senior vice NN of facilities management . “ It did allow us to make a lot of NNS and improve things beyond what we ’d been planning at the NN . ” Langone ’s JJ defenses have n’t been tested yet . But Baylor College of Medicine ’s response to 2017 ’s Hurricane Harvey shows that good preparation should pay off . The college lost thousands of research animals in Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 — and spent $ 35 CD afterward on better flood defenses , including food NNS and pumps . When Hurricane Harvey hit in 2017 — a Category 4 hurricane that was CD of the costliest Atlantic storms ever — the college was ready . Baylor had a “ ride out ” team of 52 NNS , including some dedicated to taking care of the JJ school ’s 100,000 animals while the campus was flooded . None died . Most of the major biotech and pharmaceutical NNS have been preparing for NN NN for NNS . Johnson & Johnson and Novo Nordisk scored an A rating from CDP ; Sanofi , Pfizer , Roche , Novartis , Merck , Eli Lilly , Takeda , and Biogen all scored an A minus . GlaxoSmithKline and AbbVie earned B ratings , and Amgen and Bristol - Myers Squibb got C’s . The ratings are VBN on the NN ’s awareness and management of NN NN issues . The size and type of their investments in those preparations vary . Johnson & Johnson , for example , wrote in its report that it underwent a full - blown review of its NN scarcity activities after a drought affected its facilities in Cape Town , South Africa . Biogen poured $ 500,000 into JJ software to monitor its supply chain after hurricanes and storms affected CD of its major locations . Amgen highlighted its efforts to reduce NN use , spotlighting a facility that now reuses about 74 percent of the treated wastewater it generates to cool its manufacturing equipment . In Cambridge , Mass . ’s legendary Kendall Square , CD local real estate developer has already worked to ensure that a third of the facilities it manages there are prepared for extreme NN events all the NN up through 2050 or further . Those preparations are necessary in part because of where Kendall Square sits . A short walk from the Charles River , the biotech hub already faces a JJ flood NN from major storms . According to a recent city report , JJ issues MD start to crop up soon . By 2050 , the NN IN Boston should be a NN or CD higher than it was in 2000 — so high that the city ’s report on NN NN vulnerability VBZ the dams that separate the rivers IN the city from Massachusetts Bay MD be pretty useless . If a once - in - a - decade storm hits , winds might blow the NN up from the pond or river — a storm surge — or NN might come back up from drainage pipes . Alexandria Real Estate has over 4.3 CD square NNS of office NN in Kendall Square . That includes at least 1.9 CD square NNS of brand - JJ NN built with NN NN in NN . Gone are basement electrical rooms and NN centers — they ’ve been moved up to the JJ floor . Thresholds for JJ - floor doors , too , are all above the point the city ’s reports suggest NN might ultimately rise if a major storm hits after the NN levels IN the city have risen by a NN or CD . Yet the real estate NN ’s not - inconsiderable NN mostly stops at the thresholds of their own buildings . The NN ca n’t stop a street from flooding or make sure the city ’s drains wo n’t become overwhelmed with stormwater . Developers in Kendall have tried ; among other things , Alexandria and others have paid for a JJ stormwater drain that can take up to 630,000 gallons of stormwater . CD thing that Alexandria and others can do — and have done — is ensure that their buildings wo n’t make flooding worse . Some Alexandria - owned buildings have equipment on the roofs that can store stormwater for a while before its released — slowly — to the street ; each site RB has a NN in place to encourage rain to drain into the ground RB , not into the streets . And specialized valves prevent sewer backups from bringing that NN into a building . ( RB the toilets will still work without adding to the sewer ’s problems , at least for a day . ) “ We ’re confident that our tenants and our properties here in Kendall Square are well - protected from NN NN vulnerabilities IN flooding , ” Andrews VBD . There are less tangible risks to consider , too : the prospect that if a NN ’s approach to NN NN is too timid , it MD be harder to recruit talented employees in an industry where sterling job applicants often have the upper hand . “ As a NN - VBN NN focused on improving the quality of NN , stakeholders MD set expectations related to Biogen ’s efforts towards NN NN , ” the NN stated — adding that if they fail to meet those expectations , potential employees MD VB elsewhere . “ Loss of highly - qualified employees to competitors due to falling short of expectations MD place Biogen ’s research and development efforts at NN . ” Merck ’s report puts a more positive spin on the issue . “ We recognize that our policies and actions IN JJ and JJ issues such as our NN footprint can VB attract and attain talent , ” the NN wrote . Yet to some , CD industry alone ca n’t make up for a broader failure to act . “ It MD seem that , you VBP , as a nation , we should be doing much more to try to mitigate these risks . They ’re just tremendous , and I do n’t VB we ’ve reflected on the cost of NN NN and other risks that are coming , ” VBD NYU ’s Schwabacher . “ We MD be doing more — should be doing more . ”"

A report by the U.N. Environment Program , released just ahead of next week ’s NN conference in Madrid , revealed that the amount of NN - heating gases being pumped into the atmosphere hit a JJ high last NN , with potentially dire consequences . The report closely follows the release of another U.N. finding that VBZ planned production of coal , oil and gas is still too much to allow for hitting more aggressive goals that some NN - NN watchers have VBN are necessary . “ We VBP quick wins to reduce NNS as much as possible in 2020 , ” VBD UNEP ’s head Inger Andersen . “ We VBP to catch up on the NNS in which we procrastinated . ” NN -made NN gas NNS rose in 2018 to 55.3 CD metric tons of NN dioxide , according to the U.N. ’s annual “ NNS gap ” report . While much of the increase came from emerging economies such as NNP and India , some of those NNS are the result of manufacturing in developed NNS , including the U.S. and Germany . And Norway , for instance , touts its green credentials while it continues to drill for oil in the North NNP . Levels of heat - trapping NN gases in the atmosphere have reached another JJ record high , separate NNS from the NNP Meteorological Organization showed , backing figures offered by UNEP . The WMO NNP Gas Bulletin showed that globally averaged concentrations of NN dioxide ( CO2 ) reached 407.8 parts per CD in 2018 , up from 405.5 parts per CD ( ppm ) in 2017 . “ This continuing JJ - term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of NN NN , including rising NNS , more extreme NN , NN stress , NN level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems , ” the WMO VBD in its release . To stop average JJ NNS from increasing by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 Fahrenheit ) this century compared with pre-industrial times , worldwide NNS of NN dioxide , methane and other NN gases will have to drop by 7.6 % each NN in the coming decade , the U.N. agency VBD . NNS VBP the 1.5C target — contained in the 2015 Paris NN accord — MD avert some of the more extreme NNS in JJ NN patterns predicted if NNS rise further . “ What we are looking at is RB that NNS VBP to VB down by 55 % by 2030 , ” VBD John Christensen , lead author and director of the UNEP - Danish Technology Institute Partnership . RB the less ambitious goal of capping JJ NN at 2C ( 3.6 F ) MD require annual NNS cuts of 2.7 % between 2020 and 2030 , UNEP VBD . RB now , national pledges MD leave the NN 3.2 degrees Celsius ( 5.8 Fahrenheit ) warmer by 2100 than pre-industrial times , with dramatic consequences for NN on NNP , the U.N. agency VBD . Getting the NN back on track to 1.5C MD require a fivefold increase in measures pledged so far , it calculated . Last week , UNEP published a separate report , which VBD that NNS are planning to extract more than twice the amount of fossil fuels from the ground than can be burned in 2030 if the 1.5C target is to be met . Read : NNP NNP - backed Heliogen ’s solar ‘ breakthrough ’ MD replace fossil fuels in steel and other big- polluting industries “ As individuals , we have a choice about how we live , what we eat and how we VBP about our business ... and opportunities to live a lower - NN NN , ” VBD Andersen . Governments ’ plans to reduce NNS have n’t been universally welcomed , however , with some critics saying that eliminating or sharply reducing fossil fuels will prove to be an JJ shock , in fuel costs for instance , that hurts poorer populations more than wealthier sections . What ’s more , a $ 60 - CD package of measures agreed by the German NN recently has been criticized as a further burden on businesses , while environmentalists VBP it is too little , too late . Presenting a NN Tuesday showing average NN air NNS in the country have already risen by 1.5C since 1881 , German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze insisted that Europe ’s industrial powerhouse “ is CD of the NNS that is doing a lot . ” “ There are other NNS which are quitting NN accords , ” she added , without explicitly naming the NNP NNPS , which under NNP Donald NNP announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement , citing noncompliance by NNP and others . But economists VBP the widespread effects MD hit all NNS and those most vulnerable are at the greatest NN . The JJ economy will be at least 3 % smaller by 2050 owed solely to the effects of unchecked NN NN , including severe NN and rising NN levels , some major investment banks have warned . In the Paris agreement , nearly 200 NNS set their own national targets for reducing or controlling pollution of heat - trapping gases . It was negotiated in 2015 with lots of prodding by the U.S. and NNP at that NN and went into effect Nov. 4 , CD . The terms of the deal VBP no country can withdraw in the JJ three NNS ; NNP began the U.S. withdrawal process earlier this month . Experts agree that the longer NNS continue burning fossil fuels , the more NN will be “ locked in ” as NNS stay in the atmosphere for NNS or RB decades . Conversely , the sooner NNS take steps to wean themselves off gas , coal and oil — such as by ending NN subsidies for fossil fuels — the more NN will be prevented in the JJ term ."

Most of the blame fell on NNS IN the U.S. , Brazil , and Saudi Arabia , but IN the NN JJ systems simply are n’t responding to the greatest NN they ’ve ever faced — they ’re so corrupted by fossil fuel NN , so overcome by inertia , so preoccupied with the next NN or coup . But , amid the desolation , there were a couple of signs of hope . They came from the NN of high finance . Just as young NNS and indigenous leaders were being kicked out of the UN talks for their protests , the Liberty Mutual insurance NN became CD of the JJ JJ U.S. insurers to announce it MD stop aiding coal NNS . The announcement came after sustained pressure from a coalition of JJ groups called Insure Our Future , and though Liberty ’s pledges are just a beginning — oil and gas are the bigger future threats at this point , as coal ’s decline is already underway — it was proof that RB vast sums of NN can’t insulate NNS from activism . That point was underscored over when Goldman Sachs announced on December 14 that it MD restrict its lending to the coal industry , and further that it was n’t interested in funding the drilling of the Arctic . Again a coalition of groups — from the Gwich ’in tribe in Alaska ’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the Sierra Club and the Rainforest NNP Network — had pressed hard . And again Goldman ’s response was just a JJ step . But given the imbalance in forces — a remote native band against CD of the NN ’s biggest banks — it was a hopeful sign . Hopeful because these kinds of campaigns are VBG to expand and build . More and more , organizers are deciding that , after decades of asking governments to VB , they ’re RB VBG to have to VB after other NN centers . NNP and Wall Street are deeply linked , but they ’re RB distinct , and both VBP to shift dramatically . And hopeful for other reasons too . RB if we can VB politicians to make real NN , it will come slowly , and CD national capitol at a NN . But if these financial giants begin to move , the effects will be both quick and JJ — and those are the CD things most required for effective progress on the NN . This winter will likely VB a prolonged campaign against JJ insurers , JJ asset managers IN Blackrock , and JJ banks . Chase Bank exemplifies the problem : they ’re the worst , lending hundreds of billions of dollars for the most extreme fossil fuel projects on NN . They ’ve dramatically their lending since the Paris accords ; they ’re the bankroll for the most dangerous activity on NN NN . If these bankers plugged the NN pipeline , the fossil fuel industry MD have to stop expanding — which is precisely what NNS have VBN us is now required . It MD seem impossible to take banks that size on — they ’re literally a central pillar of JJ capital . But look at them another NN : unlike Exxon or Shell , they ’re able to make plenty of NN from things other than fossil fuel . Destroying the NN is only a side business for them — heck , they MD make NN financing the transition to NN and wind . And they ’re potentially vulnerable to citizen anger . Activists , more and more , are taking up the cry of “ Make Them Pay , ” understanding that it ’s not okay to pile up profits by devastating the NN . Chase has 5,000 branches spread across NNP . Indigenous activists joined by my colleagues at the 350 Seattle chapter shut down all 44 branches in their city for a day last spring , and there ’s no reason not to try the same thing across the country . Anyone with a pair of scissors can cut up a credit card . VB about that electoral map that NNP always holds up to taunt his foes , the NN with the huge patches of red . Well , a map of the country ’s shows that most of it is in those blue patches where NNS care deeply about NN NN : if electoral NN is unfairly spread , so is financial NN , but this NN in a NN that might work to put pressure on the banks . The JJ and the financial are not completely separate tracks for activists , of course . IN the NN , campaigners are RB VBG after central banks , the NN - sponsored institutions that VBP much of the NN ’s monetary policy . The European Investment Bank announced earlier this autumn that it MD no longer finance fossil fuel projects ; campaigners in Switzerland VBD December 16 that they were getting closer to persuading the Swiss Central Bank to take NN ( and Swiss banks are no JJ thing ! ) . But the truly JJ NN is piled up in those JJ institutions that dominate JJ finance . That dominance is not fair nor wise , but RB now it gives us CD more lever to reach for in this moment of NN NN ."

Fink , who oversees the management of about $ 7 trillion in funds , VBD in his influential annual letter to CEOs Tuesday , Jan. 14 , 2020 , that he believes we are “ on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance ” because of a NN NN . ( AP Photo / Mark Lennihan , File ) NNP NNP ( AP ) — A changing NN means dramatic risks for the NN — and for investments too , the chief of the NN ’s largest investment manager VBD Tuesday . To prepare for and protect against those risks , BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink VBD in his influential annual letter to CEOs that his firm , which manages roughly $ 7 trillion for investors , will make a series of moves putting NN NN and sustainability at the center of its investing approach . Among them , BlackRock will cut out investments in some coal producers from some of its portfolios , sharply increase the number of sustainability - focused funds that it offers , and vote against NNS at shareholder meetings when they ’re too slow in disclosing and mitigating their impact on the environment . “ NN NN has become a defining factor in NNS ’ JJ - term prospects , ” Fink wrote in his letter , adding that he believes “ we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance ” because of it . Fink predicted that the NNS in how capital is deployed will come “ more quickly than we VBP NNS to the NN itself , ” and “ sooner than most anticipate . ” In fact , the shift is already underway . Investors poured a net $ 20.6 CD into sustainable funds across the industry last NN , nearly quadruple the record set a NN earlier , according to Morningstar . Investors , particularly younger ones , increasingly VBP they VBP their NN invested with an eye toward sustainability . The total dollars are still JJ relative to the entire industry — investors plugged a total of $ 413.9 CD into all taxable bond funds last NN , while yanking $ 41.3 CD out of all U.S. NN funds — but the trend is clear and accelerating . Fearful of losing out on those dollars — and the fees that they produce — investment NNS are rushing to meet the surging demand . BlackRock and other huge asset managers are generally behind smaller competitors when it comes to sustainability , VBD Danielle Fugere , NN of shareholder - advocacy group As You Sow . BlackRock , NNP Street , Vanguard and others have been criticized for not doing more about the environment . Besides protests outside its Manhattan headquarters , BlackRock has RB heard criticism from members of Congress who VBP it MD better address NN NN . Because of its size and reach , any shift in focus by BlackRock MD alter the industry . It is a major shareholder in thousands of NNS through its popular exchange - traded funds that track various indexes , as well as its funds run by NN - picking managers . But Fugere VBD Tuesday ’s announcement is only a JJ step . “ The words are significant , and the words show leadership , ” Fugere VBD . “ But that ’s not enough . We have to VB on the ground NN , and we VBP to VB it quickly . There is no NN . Australia is burning up . California is burning up . ” The wildfires in parts of Australia and California and other recent disasters have shown JJ institutional investors that NN NN is just as much a threat to their returns in the near term as over the coming decades . “ The physical risks have become so immediately clear and stark , ” VBD Amy Borrus , deputy director of the Council for Institutional Investors , whose members include pension funds , endowments and other U.S. - VBN asset owners investing more than $ 4 trillion . “ JJ institutional investors will welcome these steps by BlackRock , ” she VBD . “ More and more JJ funds are coming RB to the view that sound JJ , JJ and governance practices are not just about making the NN better but about fundamentally creating and preserving shareholder value . ” This approach to investing comes after a yearslong evolution for the industry , which began with simple funds that bluntly excluded stocks deemed as harmful , such as gun makers or tobacco stocks . Now , fund managers VBP they they look at JJ , JJ and governance issues broadly as part of their analysis of any investment . It ’s VBN as “ ESG ” investing , and proponents VBP it aids investors ’ returns , not just their consciences , because it helps them avoid risky stocks and JJ potential losses . NNS with poor records on JJ issues are more likely to face JJ fines , for example . For all the noise made by Fink ’s announcement , the reaction in the NN NN was muted on Tuesday . NN stocks in the S&P 500 were down , but not as much as some other corners of the NN . Coal stocks were mixed . In his letter , Fink VBD NNS and investors have a role to play in the transition to a low - NN NN , but governments will ultimately VB to lead the NN . Some movement has begun . The European Union on Tuesday unveiled a plan to dedicate a quarter of its budget to tackling NN NN and to VB shift 1 trillion euros ( $ 1.1 trillion ) in investment towards making the economy more environmentally friendly over the next CD NNS . The Europe Investment Plan will be funded by the EU budget and the private sector . It aims to deliver on European Commission NN Ursula von der Leyen ’s Green Deal to make the bloc the NN ’s JJ NN - neutral continent by 2050 . “ It will be interesting to VB whether Black Rock ’s high profile move will have any impact on policy , ” Borrus VBD . “ NN can do much more in the JJ run on NN NN than investment flows . ” AP Reporter Samuel Petrequin contributed to this report from Brussels ."

But CD of the most frightening studies I 've read recently had nothing to do with icebergs or mega - droughts . In a paper that came out Oct. 23 in NNP , John Sterman  a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's ( MIT ) Sloan School of Management  wrote about asking 212 MIT grad students to give a rough idea of how much governments VBP to reduce JJ NN gas NNS by to eventually stop the increase in the concentration of NN in the atmosphere . These students had training in NN , technology , mathematics and economics at CD of the best schools in the NN  they are probably a lot smarter than you or me . Yet 84 % of Sterman 's subjects got the question wrong , greatly underestimating the degree to which NN gas NNS VBP to fall . When the MIT kids can't figure out NN NN , what are the odds that the broader NN will ? The shocking NN reflects the tremendous gap that exists regarding JJ NN . On the CD hand are the NNS , who with few exceptions VBP NN NN is very serious and needs to be dealt with immediately and ambitiously . On the other side is the NN , which increasingly believes that NN NN is real and worries about it , but which rarely ranks it as a high priority . A 2007 survey by the U.N. Development Programme VBD that 54 % of Americans advocate taking a "" wait and VB "" approach to NN - NN NN  holding off on the deep and rapid cuts in JJ NN that MD immediately impact their lives . ( And it 's not just SUV - driving Americans who take this position  similar majorities were VBN in NNP , NNP and India . ) As a result , we have our current dilemma : a steady drumbeat of scientific NN of JJ NN 's severity and comparatively little in the NN of meaningful JJ NN . "" This gap exists , "" VBZ Sterman . "" The real question is why . "" Hear Bryan Walsh and John Sterman talk about the problems faced by NNS in communicating the risks of NN NN . That 's where Sterman 's research comes in . "" There is a profound and fundamental misconception about NN , "" he VBZ . The problem is that most of us do n't RB understand how NN accumulates in the atmosphere . Increasing JJ NNS are driven by the increase in the concentration of NN in the atmosphere . Before the industrial age , the concentration was about 280 parts per CD ( p.p.m. ) of NN in the atmosphere . After a few centuries of burning coal , oil and other fossil fuels , we 've raised that concentration to 387 p.p.m. , and it continues to rise by about 2 p.p.m. every NN . JJ NNS VBP that we VBP to at least stabilize NN concentrations at 450 p.p.m. to ensure that JJ NNS do n't increase more than about 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level . To do that , we VBP to reduce JJ NN NNS ( which hit about CD CD tons last NN ) until they are equal to or less than the amount of NN sequestered by the oceans and plant NN ( which removed about 4.8 CD tons of NN last NN ) . It 's just IN NN in a bathtub  unless more NN is draining out than flowing in from the tap , eventually the bathtub will overflow . That means that NN NNS MD VB to be cut drastically from current levels . Yet almost all of the subjects in Sterman 's NN failed to realize that , assuming instead that you MD stabilize NN concentration simply by capping NN NNS at their current level . That 's not the NN  and in fact , pursuing such a plan for the future MD virtually guarantee that JJ NN MD spin out of NN . It MD seem to JJ IN good common sense to wait until we VBP proof of the serious damage JJ NN is doing before we take NN . But it 's not  we can't "" wait and VB "" on JJ NN because the NN has a momentum all its own , and if we wait for decades to finally act to reduce NN NNS , it MD well be too late . Yet this simply is n't understood . Someone as smart as NNP NNP does n't seem to VB it . "" Fortunately NN NN , although it 's a huge challenge , it 's a challenge that happens over a JJ period of NN , "" he VBD at a forum in Beijing last NN . "" You VBP , we have NN to work on it . "" But the truth is we do n't . If élite NNS MD simply solve NN NN on their own , JJ misunderstanding MD n't be such a problem . But they can't . Reducing NN NNS sharply will require all 6.5 CD ( and growing ) of us on the NN to hugely VB the NN we use NN and travel . We 'll RB VB to VB the NN we vote , rewarding politicians willing to make the tough choices on NN . Instead of a JJ Manhattan Project  the metaphor often VBN for JJ NN  Sterman believes that what is needed is closer to a JJ civil rights movement , a JJ - scale campaign that dramatically VBZ the NN 's beliefs and behaviors . JJ groups IN NNP Gore 's We Campaign are aiming for just such a JJ transformation , but "" the reality is that this is RB more difficult than civil rights , "" VBZ Sterman . "" RB that took a JJ NN , and we do n't have that kind of NN with the NN . "" The good NN is that you do n't VB a Ph.D. in climatology to understand what needs to be done . If you can grasp the bathtub analogy , you can understand how to stop JJ NN . The burden is on NNS to better explain in clear English the dynamics of the NN NN , and how to affect it . ( Sterman VBZ that the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP 's landmark report last NN was "" completely inadequate "" on this score . ) As for the rest of us , we should try to remember that sometimes common sense is n't a match for NN ."

The most comprehensive account yet published VBZ that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys . But the authors are worried that , as NNS return to work , car use will soar again . They fear CO2 NNS MD soon be higher than before the NN . They are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real , durable NNS on transport and personal mobility . • NN : Five charts about the biggest NN crash In the UK , Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged £ 250 m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure . Other NNS are RB looking at similar plans . The lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to NNP - CD have had a significant impact on the NN - producing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do . Road transport has declined hugely , as has aviation . However , now that the UK is beginning to return to work , Mr Shapps VBD NNS should drive to work rather than use JJ transport , should walking or cycling not be an option . "" If you can't walk or cycle but you do have access to a car , please use it rather than travelling by bus , train or tram , "" he VBD . Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for NN all over the NN has crashed . Now in detailed analysis , researchers have shown how those NNS have impacted our NNS of CO2 . They 've calculated the fall off in NN VBN on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 NNS that between them account for 97 % of JJ NNS . During the peak of the NN in early April , daily NNS dropped by 17 % compared to the previous NN , meaning RB 17 CD tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day . The key to the fall has been cars . NN transport NNS have declined by 43 % , the same amount as the drop from industry and NN generation combined . • How much warmer is your city ? • What is your diet 's NN footprint ? • Where we are in seven charts While the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the JJ impact , it only accounts for CD % of the decrease during the NN . NNP has been responsible for the biggest drop , followed by the US , Europe and India . If some restrictions on JJ activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the NN , then JJ NNS will likely drop by 7 % . If pre-pandemic levels of transport and JJ activity return by mid-June , the annual fall MD be RB 4 % . But the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound , especially on the roads , MD VB a NN surge . Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants , too . CD of the UK's leading experts , Prof Frank Kelly , from King 's College London , VBD he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully CD NNS before US authorities exposed the scandal . He VBD Radio 4's The NNP Scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between NNS declared by the car firms and real readings on the road . Prof Kelly VBD he reported it to the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) , but they did n't publish his findings . He VBD work undertaken subsequently in the US led to legal NN against car makers that had installed "" defeat devices "" to fool regulators . The NN did n't deny the account . A spokesperson VBD : "" We are taking urgent NN to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by the NNP NNP Organization as an ' example for the rest of the NN to follow ' "" . Meanwhile , on the NNP - CD NN , he VBD levels of the pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60 % in London since the fall in traffic under lockdown . Levels of another pollutant , sooty particles , remained at harmful concentrations . "" A JJ worry that NNS will naturally VB to VB back to their cars to VB to work , and that MD rebound the NNS to the same level or RB higher than before , once everybody goes back , "" VBD Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the NNP of East Anglia , who led the analysis . The researchers VBP that fundamental , systemic NN is needed if the NNS curve is to be flattened in a NN that MD limit the very worst impacts of NN NN . When it comes to transportation , there are huge opportunities , according to Prof Le Quéré . She VBZ that after the JJ financial NN in 2008 , some governments IN NNP , US and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar NN and this drove down the prices of these renewables . "" Here now in 2020 we 're very close to the same situation in electric mobility , "" she VBD BBC NNP . "" Battery prices have come down , we have lots of models and governments are VBG to try to boost their economies . "" "" So if these CD things can align , then it MD make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow . "" • NN to urge us all to walk and cycle more Grabbing the opportunity that the NN has presented is RB at the forefront of corporate thinking on NN NN . A letter signed by 155 major NNS , representing $ 2.4 trillion ( £ 1.96 trillion ) in NN capitalisation , calls for a net - zero NNS response to the NN NN . Corporations including Carlsberg , Iberdrola , EDF and Coca Cola Europe VBP they VBP governments to "" prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy "" .

A four - degree - warmer NN is the stuff of nightmares and yet that ’s where we ’re heading in just decades . While governments mull various NN targets aimed at keeping JJ - induced JJ heating within safe levels – including JJ ambitions to reach net - zero NNS by 2050 – it ’s worth looking ahead pragmatically at what happens if we fail . After all , JJ NNS VBP it ’s highly unlikely that we will stay below 2C ( above pre-industrial levels ) by the end of the century , let alone 1.5C . Most NNS are not making anywhere near enough progress to meet these internationally agreed targets . NN models predict we ’re currently on track for a heating of somewhere between 3C and 4C for 2100 , although bear in NN that these are JJ average NNS – at the poles and over land ( where NNS live ) , the increase MD be double that . Predictions are tricky , however , as NNS depend on how sensitive the NN is to NN dioxide ( CO ) . Most models assume that it is not very sensitive – that ’s where the lower 3C comes from – but a whole JJ set of models to be published in 2021 finds much greater sensitivity . They put heating at RB 5C by the end of the century , meaning NNS MD be experiencing as much as 10C of heating over land . Such uncertainty is n’t ideal , but for our purposes let ’s plump for an entirely feasible planetary heating of 4C by the end of the century . If that seems a JJ NN away , consider that plenty of NNS you VBP will be RB then . My NNS will be in their 80s , perhaps with middle - aged NNS and grandchildren . We are making their NN and it will be a very JJ place . Four degrees MD not sound IN much – after all , it is less than a typical NN NN between night and day . It might RB sound pleasant , IN retiring from the UK to southern Spain . However , an average heating of the entire globe by 4C MD render the NN unrecognisable from anything NNS have ever experienced . The last NN the NN was this hot was 15 m NNS ago during the miocene , when intense volcanic eruptions in western North NNP emitted vast quantities of CO . NN levels rose some 40 metres higher than today and lush forests grew in Antarctica and the Arctic . However , that JJ heating took place over JJ thousands of NNS . RB at its most rapid , the rise in CO NNS occurred at a rate 1,000 times slower than ours has since the start of the Industrial Revolution . That gave animals and plants NN to adapt to JJ conditions and , crucially , ecosystems had not been degraded by NNS . Things look considerably bleaker for our 2100 NN . Over the past decade , NNS have been able to produce a far more nuanced picture of how NN rise affects the complexities of cloud cover and atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and ecology . We ’re looking at vast dead zones in the oceans as nutrients from fertiliser runoff combine with warmer waters to produce an explosion in algae that starve marine NN of oxygen . This will be exacerbated by the acidity from dissolved CO , which will VB a mass die - off , particularly of shellfish , plankton and coral . “ We will have lost all the reefs decades before 2100 – at somewhere between 2C and 4C , ” VBZ Johan Rockström , director of the Potsdam Institute for NNP Impact Research in Germany . NN levels will be perhaps CD metres higher and , more worryingly , we will be well on our NN to an NN - free NN , having passed the tipping points for the Greenland and west Antarctic NN sheets , committing us to at least CD metres of NN - level rise in coming centuries . That ’s because as NN sheets melt , their NN drops to a lower altitude where it is warmer , speeding up melting in a runaway feedback loop . Eventually , dark , heat - absorbing land is exposed , speeding the melting process RB more . By 2100 , we will RB have lost most low - latitude glaciers , including CD - thirds of the so called third pole of the Hindu Kush - Karakoram - Himalayan mountains and Tibetan plateau that feeds JJ of Asia ’s important rivers . However , most rivers , especially in Asia , will flood more often , according to research by Richard Betts , head of NN impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre , because the hotter atmosphere will produce more intense monsoons , violent storms and extreme rainfall . His studies predict a wide equatorial belt of high humidity that will VB intolerable heat stress across most of tropical Asia , Africa , Australia and the Americas , rendering them uninhabitable for much of the NN . Tropical forests of heat - tolerant NNS MD well thrive in this wet zone with the high CO concentrations , especially with the disappearance of JJ infrastructure and agriculture , although the conditions will probably favour lianas ( vines ) over slower - growing trees , Betts VBZ . To the south and north of this humid zone , bands of expansive desert will RB rule out agriculture and JJ habitation . Some models predict that desert conditions will stretch from the Sahara RB up through south and central Europe , drying rivers including the Danube and the Rhine . In South NNP , the picture is more complicated : increased precipitation MD enhance the Amazon rainforest , leading to mightier river flow . Other models predict a weakening of the easterlies over the Atlantic , drying the Amazon , increasing fires and turning it from forest to grassland . The tipping point for the Amazon MD well be triggered by deforestation ; while the intact forest MD cope with some drought because it generates and maintains its own moist ecosystem , areas that have been opened up through degradation allow moisture to escape . “ A combination of NN NN and deforestation MD push it into a savannah NN , ” Rockström VBZ . All of nature will be affected by the NN in NN , ecosystems and hydrology and there will be plenty of extinctions as NNS struggle to migrate and adapt to an utterly changed NN . Daniel Rothman , co-director of MIT ’s Lorenz Center , calculates that 2100 will herald the beginning of NNP ’s sixth mass extinction event . But what about us ? This is undoubtedly a more hostile , dangerous NN for humanity , which by 2100 will number RB 11 CD , all of whom will VB food , NN , NN and somewhere to live . It will be , in a giant understatement , problematic . The good NN is that NNS wo n’t become extinct – the NNS can survive with just a few hundred individuals ; the bad NN is , we VBP great loss of NN and perhaps the end of our civilisations . JJ of the places where NNS live and grow food will no longer be suitable for either . Higher NN levels will make today ’s low - lying islands and JJ coastal regions , where nearly half the JJ population live , uninhabitable , generating an estimated 2 CD refugees by 2100 . Bangladesh alone will lose CD - third of its land area , including its main breadbasket . From 2030 , more than half the population will live in the tropics , an area that makes up a third of the NN and already struggles with NN impacts . Yet by 2100 , most of the low and mid latitudes will be uninhabitable because of heat stress or drought ; despite stronger precipitation , the hotter soils will lead to faster evaporation and most populations will struggle for fresh NN . We will have to live on a smaller land NN with a larger population . Indeed , the consequences of a 4C warmer NN are so terrifying that most NNS MD rather not contemplate them , let alone work out a survival strategy . Rockström does n’t VB our chances . “ It ’s difficult to VB how we MD accommodate eight CD NNS or maybe RB half of that , ” he VBZ . “ There will be a rich minority of NNS who survive with modern lifestyles , no doubt , but it will be a turbulent , conflict - ridden NN . ” He points out that we already use nearly half the NN ’s NN - free NN to produce food for 7 CD NNS and thinks meeting the needs of 11 CD in such hostile conditions MD be impossible . “ The reason is primarily making enough food , but RB we MD have lost the biodiversity we ’re dependent on and be facing a cocktail of negative shocks all the NN , from fires to droughts . ” Others are more sanguine . “ I do n’t VB that NNS as a NN or RB industrial civilisation is seriously threatened , ” VBZ Ken Caldeira , climatologist at the Carnegie Institution for NNP in California . “ NNS live in Houston , Miami and Atlanta because they live in air conditioning through the hot summers . If NNS are rich enough to air - condition their lives , they can watch whatever is the successor to Game of Thrones on TV , as the natural NN decays IN them , ” he VBZ . But he points out that while richer NNS VBP a loss to their quality of NN , the poorer NN their actual lives . So how might we give all of humanity the best chance ? Our best hope lies in cooperating as never before to radically reorganise our NN : decoupling the JJ map from geography . However unrealistic it sounds , we ’d VB to look at the NN afresh and VB it in terms of where the resources are and then plan the population , food and NN production IN that . It MD mean abandoning huge tracts of the globe and moving NNP ’s JJ population to the high latitudes : Canada , Siberia , Scandinavia , parts of Greenland , Patagonia , Tasmania , NNP Zealand and perhaps newly NN - free parts of the western Antarctic coast . If we allow 20 sq m of NN per person – more than double the minimum habitable NN allowed per person under English planning regulations – 11 CD NNS MD VB 220,000 sq km of land to live on . The area of Canada alone is 9.9 m sq km and , combined with all the other high - latitude areas , such as Alaska , Britain , NNP and Scandinavia , there should be plenty of room for everyone . These precious lands , with tolerable NNS and access to NN , MD RB be valuable food - growing areas , as well as the last oases for JJ NNS , so NNS MD VB to be housed in compact , efficient high - rise cities with reflective roofs and resource - recycling systems . That risks raising local NNS to intolerable levels , because compact cities function as heat islands , so solar - powered cooling or RB artificial winds MD be needed to counteract this . There is RB an increased NN of epidemics in such densely populated spaces . Peter Cox , a climatologist at the NNP of Exeter , thinks this is viable , but MD require a massive programme of infrastructure to manage waste , air quality and NN needs . City - scale underground reservoirs MD supply domestic needs and efficient recycling MD keep NN – and other resources – circulating in the population for NNS rather than hours . Post - fossil fuels , we will require unprecedented electricity production . This MD come from vast arrays of solar - and wind - NN plants in a belt across the uninhabitable desert regions . High - voltage direct current transmission lines MD relay this NN to the cities or it MD be stored as thermal NN in molten salts and transported in hydrogen – after solar NN is VBN to split NN to provide hydrogen for fuel cells . Hydrogen production will be on an industrial scale and it MD be VBN for nonelectric transport , for instance . Wave farms , nuclear fission ( and potentially fusion ) and solar NN will VB meet our electricity needs . In the meantime , the effective capture from the air of today ’s NN NNS will with luck be a reality ; they can be stored or VBN in the manufacture of materials . Food production will VB to be more intensive , efficient and industrial . This will be a mostly vegetarian NN , largely devoid of fish and without the grazing area or resources for livestock . Poultry MD be viable on the edges of farmland and synthetic meats and other foods will meet some of the demand . Heat - tolerant , drought - resistant crop varieties , such as cassava and millet , will replace JJ of our current unmodified staples such as rice and wheat and they will grow faster and with greater NN efficiency because of the high CO levels . CD problem is that almost all of our agriculture will VB to be at higher latitudes , because the tropics will be too dry or too hot for farmworkers . And that means less land and less sunlight in winter . “ JJ agriculture MD be limited by the geometry of NNP ’s orbit IN the NN , ” Cox VBZ . “ However , studies have shown that crops thrive with artificial light delivered by LEDs at exactly the JJ frequencies for photosynthesis . This means we MD grow crops through the winter months , hydroponically in smaller spaces , stacked up in warehouses or RB underground , leaving valuable land surfaces for other uses . ” Cultivation of algal mats and crops grown on floating platforms and in marshland MD RB contribute , while crops MD potentially be grown in uninhabitable regions , farmed and processed remotely by artificial farmers . Either NN , we MD VB to use far more precise nutrient and irrigation systems to avoid polluting more fertile ecosystems and reduce food loss and waste . A 4C warmer NN MD well be survivable , but it MD be eminently poorer than the NN we currently enjoy . Rockström believes it takes us beyond our NN capabilities . Delivering our NNS to such a deadly home is a horrifying proposition . Given what ’s at stake , it MD be worth deploying geoengineering tools , which reflect the NN ’s heat away from NNP , and so keep JJ heating to safe levels . This MD n’t address the problem of dissolved NN killing oceanic NN , but it MD buy us more NN to decarbonise and achieve negative NNS . Crucially , keeping NNP cooler for longer MD VB the poorest NNS to adapt . “ We have come to a point where JJ forms of geoengineering cannot be excluded , ” admits Rockström , “ but SRM [ solar radiation management ] is a very dangerous geopolitical tool to deploy : who decides which part of the globe to shade ? How MD we govern it ? ” he asks . We ’ve already warmed the NN by 1.1C , and we ’re experiencing the effects : the International Federation of the Red Cross estimates there are as JJ as 50 CD NN refugees . Once we reach 4C , most models agree it will be impossible to return to today ’s abundant NN . “ For me , the issue is that we are transforming ( and simplifying ! ) our NN for JJ thousands of NNS into the future with millennia of rising NN [ levels ] , acidified oceans and intolerable tropical NNS , just because we were n’t willing to pay the JJ differential between fossil - fuelled prosperity and prosperity fuelled by non-greenhouse - gas - emitting NN systems , ” VBZ Caldeira . We are now making the NN of 2100 and however hard it seems to meet our NNS targets , it ’ll be far harder for our NNS if we do n’t . With international cooperation and regulation , we can make it livable . • This article was amended on 28 November 2019 .

There were 70 tropical cyclones or hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere in 2018 , compared with the JJ - term average of 53 . Powerful and often record - breaking storms brought devastation to the Mariana Islands , Philippines , Vietnam , Korea , and Tonga . In the U.S. , hurricanes Florence and Michael caused huge JJ damage and considerable loss of NN , the WMO noted in its annual NN statement . Heat waves resulted in an astounding loss in productivity in 2018 , because it was often either too hot to work or RB VB outside safely . An incredible 153 CD hours of labour were wiped out last NN due to heat waves , nearly three times more than 2000 , according to the 2018 report of the Lancet Countdown on NN and NN NN released November 28 . The most recent El Niño event ended in CD , and it was associated with catastrophic coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef , severe droughts in Africa , South NNP and parts of the Pacific and southeast Asia , and wildfires in Indonesia and Canada . While the current El Niño is not expected to be as severe , it MD still bring dangerous NN to vulnerable areas IN the NN , NNS warn . El Niño and its opposite , La Niña , form a natural cycle that can last from a few months to CD or three NNS . When they occur , NN patterns IN the NN can be affected , producing a range of impacts on crop yields , famine , heating , and cooling demands of homes and buildings , fire risks , coral bleaching , and extreme NN . Researchers VBP the impacts of El Niño / La Niña events have become more severe over the past 20 NNS due to a warmer NN . This is akin to an athlete on steroids who takes stimulants during the Olympic final . The combination of JJ - caused NN and a natural upswing in NNS increases the odds that any JJ El Niño NN will be the warmest ever , VBD NN scientist Michael Mann from Pennsylvania NNP NNP . Mann co-authored a 2018 NN linking NN NN to the recent run of record - breaking droughts , heat waves , wildfires , and flooding events in the northern hemisphere . These destructive NN extremes will increase 50 percent on average and MD increase as much as 300 percent due to NN NN alone unless the NN acts quickly to cut NN NNS from burning fossil fuels , the NN concluded . Normally , El Niño events bring heavy rains to California , and if that happens this winter it MD lead to flash flooding and mud slides after wildfires burned 1.6 CD acres this autumn , VBD Stevenson . Nearly 14,000 homes were destroyed in those fires and now the JJ storms of the season have already produced flooding and mud slides . While El Niño brings rain and cooler NN to the southern U.S. , it brings heat and drought to Australia , as well as dry winter conditions in southeastern Africa and northern Brazil . Catastrophic wildfires have already broken out in eastern Australia , along with a heat wave with NNS over 44 degrees C ( 111 degrees F ) at the end of November . As JJ NN continues future El Niño events will likely result in RB cooler and wetter conditions in the U.S. , enhancing flood risks . Meanwhile , La Niña events will increase wildfire danger and drought in the southwestern NNP NNPS , Stevenson VBD . While the impacts of El Niño / La Niña events are amplified in a warmer NN , it ’s not VBN whether NN NN will affect the occurrence or strength of these events in the future , she VBD . La Niña and El Niño are , respectively , the cold and warm phases of the El Niño - Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) cycle , which regulates heat in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean . In conditions defined by climatologists as "" neutral , "" high air pressure predominates in the eastern Pacific , while low pressure predominates in the west . The difference in pressure generates the trade winds , which blow east to west over the NN of the tropical Pacific , pushing the warm waters westward . The deeper , cooler waters then NN in the east , replacing the warm waters ."

Members : The NN task force is a task force of the whole council , which includes members from business , NN , JJ and civic organizations . NN NN Task Force Member List History : The task force decided to focus on four areas of policy development : • NN NN Principles . These principles provide the Council with a shared statement on NN NN and guide the Council 's more in - depth discussions of NN NN policies and approaches . View Principles . • Technology Working Group . This group examined the various types of technologies that are currently available , under development , or anticipated that MD VB reduce NN gas NNS , as well as examined various policies or incentives that MD foster the development and dissemination of these technologies in this country and abroad . Working Group Tri-chairs : General Motors , NNP Resources Institute and the U.S. Department of NNP • Working Group on JJ , Regulatory , and Voluntary Measures . This group examined a broad range of JJ instruments , regulatory approaches , and voluntary steps that MD be taken to reduce NNS of NN gases . These MD include tradeable permits ; tax credits / deductions for investing in improved technologies ; NN taxes ; mitigation measures for JJ or regional dislocations ; partnerships among the investment and insurance communities , NN , and industry ; various regulatory approaches ; and voluntary initiatives . • Working Group on Cross- cutting Policies . Policies were identified to reduce NNS of NN gases while RB furthering progress in other areas of sustainable development . This working group provided a focus for drawing linkages between the NNP NNP Task Force and the Council 's other task forces ( NNP Management , Metropolitan / Rural Strategies for Sustainable Communities , and International ) and for identifying those policies that MD have benefits in more than CD area . Other areas of activity include : • Demonstrating the Implementation of NN Gas Reduction Policies and Activities • JJ outreach activities including community forums , the creation of a website , providing NN to the NN , and giving speeches and presentations on NN NN policies and activities . • Working with the Council 's Evaluating Progress Working Group to identify indicators and measures for tracking progress in addressing the issue of NN NN . Progress Report : The NNP task force sent a letter to the NNP in November 1997 ( Press Release 11/26/97 ) outlining its JJ product : a set of NN principles which were agreed upon to VB the task force in its policy deliberations . In the letter , the co-chairs of the Council stated : "" This consensus statement about NN policy from industry , JJ , citizen and NN and local leaders is , as far as we are aware , the JJ such agreement on NN policy . "" The principles call for incentives for early NN , international commitments , accountability , flexibility , strong measures to encourage technology , and fairness . Working group meetings began in February 1998 . • 1 . The Working groups developed a set of recommendations to accelerate the development and deployment of NN - friendly technology , principles for early NN to reduce NN gas NNS , and identified steps that MD be taken to foster broad - VBN community participation to realize the benefits of NN protection . 2 . The NNP Task Force transmitted the Early NNP Principles to the NNP ( Transmittal Letter to the NNP ) in October 1998 .

A federal appeals NN on Friday , Jan. 17 , 2020 , dismissed a lawsuit by 21 young NNS who claimed the U.S. NN 's NN policy harms them and jeopardizes their future . ( Chris Pietsch / The Register - Guard via AP , File ) PORTLAND , Ore. ( AP ) — A federal appeals NN on Friday dismissed a lawsuit by 21 young NNS who claimed the U.S. NN ’s NN policies and reliance on fossil fuels harms them , jeopardizes their future and violates their constitutional rights , potentially dealing a fatal blow to a JJ - running NN that activists saw as an important front in the NN against JJ degradation . The Oregon - VBN youth advocacy group Our NNPS ’s Trust filed the lawsuit in 2015 in Eugene on behalf of the youngsters . It sought an injunction ordering the NN to implement a plan to phase out fossil fuel NNS and draw down atmospheric NN dioxide emission . The NN had bounced IN the federal courts for five NNS and multiple trial dates were canceled . The 2 - 1 vote for dismissal by the 9th Circuit NNP of Appeals was a serious setback for the NN activists , who vowed to ask the full 9th Circuit panel to review the ruling . Our NNS ’s Trust has filed numerous similar NNS in NN and federal courts and currently has nine NNS pending in NN courts from Alaska to NNP Mexico . The federal ruling was less likely to impact those NNS , experts VBD . “ This is a very serious blow to the NN , perhaps a fatal blow , ” VBD Jennifer Rushlow , an associate dean for JJ programs at Vermont Law School , who has been watching the NN closely . Our NNS ’s Trust VBD in a statement that although the justices ruled for dismissal , it was important to note that they RB VBD in the opinion that the NN showed NN NN was real and caused by fossil fuels and that the young plaintiffs had suffered legitimate consequences from NN NN . The “ NN is far from over , ” VBD Julia Olson , lead attorney for Our NNPS ’s Trust . “ The NN recognized that NN NN is exponentially increasing and that the federal NN has RB VBN that its actions substantially contribute to the NN NN . ” NN attorneys repeatedly sought the NN ’s dismissal and succeeded in having the scope of the claims narrowed and some defendants dismissed during NNS of back - and - forth litigation . On Friday , the NN wrote that the youngsters made a compelling NN that NN is needed and agreed that NN NN is undeniable , but VBD the proper venue for addressing the nation ’s NNS policies and fossil fuel use is the U.S. Congress or the executive branch . In addition , the justices wrote that ending the use of fossil fuels in the U.S. alone — which is what the plaintiffs sought — MD not be enough to slow or stop NN NN . “ That ’s the heartbreaking thing about this opinion . The 9th Circuit recognizes that NN NN is an existential threat … and agrees that the JJ branches have not done enough to address this problem in the past and are unlikely to do so in the future . But the NN just feels it ’s in a RB difficult situation , ” VBD Cara Horowitz , co-director of the Emmett Institute on NNP NNP and the Environment at the NNP of California , Los Angeles School of Law . The youths , who were between the ages of 8 and 18 when the lawsuit was filed in 2015 , tied specific incidents that had affected their lives to NN NN and U.S. NN policies . In CD instance , a young woman VBD she was forced to leave her home on a Navajo reservation because of NN scarcity , separating her from her relatives . Another — the youngest plaintiff — VBD storms driven by NN NN have hurt his home , a barrier island off the Florida coast that ’s just 13 NNS ( 3.96 meters ) above NN level . Still others cite NN impacts , such as worsening asthma attacks from air pollution . The plaintiffs come from all over the U.S. , from Oregon to Louisiana to NNP NNP . The sole dissenting justice , Josephine Staton , wrote that “ my colleagues throw up their hands . ” “ No NN can singlehandedly prevent the catastrophic effects of NN NN predicted by the NN and NNS . ... and the mere fact that this suit cannot alone halt NN NN does not mean that it presents no claim suitable for judicial resolution , ” Staton wrote in her dissent . This story has been corrected to show the dissenting judge ’s last name is Staton , not Stanton ."

Over the next century , NN NN will make the oceans warmer and more acidic . Melting NN sheets will drive up NN levels at an accelerating pace . Marine heat waves will become 20 to 50 times more frequent , harming sensitive ecosystems . And the total biomass of animals in the NN MD drop by as much as 15 % , according to the sobering assessment by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP . “ The oceans and NN are in trouble , so we ’re all in trouble , ” VBD Michael Oppenheimer , a NN scientist at Princeton and a lead author of the report . But while some damage is inevitable at this point , the report makes clear that society ’s efforts to reduce NN gas NNS in the coming decades will determine how bad things ultimately VBP . It ’s “ the difference between an unmanageable problem and CD that NNS can deal with , ” Oppenheimer VBD . The analysis , released Wednesday at a meeting of NNS and policymakers in Monaco , follows close on the heels of the U.N. NNP NNP Summit in NNP NNP , which failed to elicit ambitious commitments from the NN ’s biggest polluters . Yet the report underscores just how costly delaying NN will be . Thus far , the NN ’s oceans have been the quiet hero of our VBG NN . They have absorbed about a quarter of the NN dioxide NNS have pumped into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial revolution , and 90 % of the resulting heat . “ But it ca n’t keep up , ” VBD Ko Barrett , the deputy administrator for research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a vice chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP , or IPCC . The report illustrates how NN NN has already started to alter the chemistry and circulation of the oceans , and how that exacts a heavy toll on marine ecosystems . Coastal communities , which will be home to a CD NNS by 2050 , are RB feeling the impacts , starting with rising seas . Over the last century , NN level rise was primarily driven by runoff from melting mountain glaciers in places IN Alaska and the Andes , as well as by the expansion of seawater as it warmed . Now , however , the massive NN sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have taken over as the largest contributors , and they are increasing NN levels faster than ever . Since 2006 , NN levels have risen at a rate of 0.14 of an inch per NN — more than double the rate over the previous century . The JJ question is what will happen next . VBN on JJ research since the last IPCC assessment came out in 2014 , the authors increased their estimates of projected future NN levels . Compared with the turn of the 21st century , NN levels will increase about 1.5 NNS by 2100 and will rise a total of 3 NNS by the NN 2300 — if society rapidly reduces NN gases . That will present plenty of challenges , “ but things will evolve slowly , giving NNS plenty of NN to plan , ” Oppenheimer VBD . On the other hand , if NNS fail to curb NNS in the next few decades , the NN will VB about 3 NNS of NN level rise by the end of the century — and much more after that . In the worst - NN scenario , in which parts of the Antarctic NN sheet start to collapse , we MD be in for as much as 17 NNS of NN level rise by 2300 . That MD probably outpace society ’s ability to adapt , Oppenheimer VBD . No NN knows exactly where the tipping point lies , but NNS have already seen troubling signs of rapid NN loss in places IN Antarctica ’s Thwaites Glacier , which alone contains enough NN to raise NN levels by 2 NNS . “ That is very worrying , ” VBD Regine Hock , a glaciologist at the NNP of Alaska Fairbanks and an author of the report . “ The indications are there that instability might be on its NN . ” ( Hock RB coordinated a chapter on high - mountain areas , which looked at the impacts of shrinking glaciers and snowpacks on ecosystems and communities . ) Regardless of how much NN levels rise over the JJ term , they will VB problems for coastal communities in the short term because of increasingly devastating storm surges and high tides . By 2050 , flood events that VBD to occur only once a century will happen at least once every NN in JJ places in the NN , RB under a best - NN scenario , according to the report . In fact , CD NN VBD that so - called 100 - NN floods will occur in Los Angeles about five times per NN by mid-century . On top of that , hurricanes will intensify , and extreme El Niño and La Niña events — which have profound impacts on California ’s NN — are forecast to happen twice as often by the end of the century . That ’s JJ no matter how quickly NNS reduce NN gas NNS . JJ of these episodes will be unlike anything in living memory , and will require communities to plan for unprecedented impacts . “ If we do business as usual , we wo n’t be prepared for them , ” VBD So - Min Cheong , a JJ geographer at the NNP of Kansas and an author of the report . The assessment RB looked at how NN NN is affecting fish populations and the communities that depend on them . NN waters have put JJ marine animals on the move , and range shifts are expected to become more pronounced in the future . CD analysis VBD that some fish NNS along the West Coast MD migrate as much as 600 NNS north under a high - NNS scenario . ( Creatures that can’t relocate , IN corals , MD simply be eradicated . ) Some animals will thrive in their JJ homes and others will hit dead ends , forcing fishing industries to adapt . But on the whole , unmitigated NN NN will decrease the potential catch of JJ fisheries by 20 % , the report concluded . Tropical NNS will be hit the hardest , in part because JJ communities depend heavily on the ocean for their livelihood , VBD Katie Matthews , chief scientist at the nonprofit organization Oceana , who was not involved in the report . As with NN level rise , however , the extent of the damage depends on how quickly society acts to reduce NNS , she VBD . A recent NN VBD that meeting the goals of the Paris NN accord — which are to limit JJ NN to less than 2 degrees Celsius — MD protect 3 CD tons of the most lucrative fish catches . These gains MD benefit developing NNS the most . The report authors called on governments to protect ecosystems and NNS from these impacts . It emphasized the NN to slash NN gas NNS , and to reduce other stresses on marine animals to give them breathing room to adapt to NN NN . There is no NN - size - fits - all approach to making coastal communities more resilient , Cheong VBD , but governments MD VB by improving early warning systems for disasters , encouraging residents to plan for NN NN when they rebuild , or , in some NNS , consider retreating altogether . The report highlighted the NN to start adapting now for an uncertain future . “ We owe it to our NNS and future generations to plan for resilient communities while we can , ” VBD Jack Ainsworth , executive director of the California Coastal Commission . “ History will judge us harshly if we do nothing or take halfhearted steps . ” In Oppenheimer ’s view , the U.S. is particularly far behind . The National Flood Insurance Program gives NNS an incentive to remain where they will be vulnerable to future storms , and the NN ’s reactive approach means that there is often no NN for NN until after a disaster has struck . “ These communities along the coast are basically sitting ducks , ” he VBD . But there are RB reasons to be hopeful . The ocean holds the potential to accomplish roughly a quarter of the NN gas reductions needed to meet the Paris NN targets , according to a report released Monday by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy , a group of NNS and NN leaders convened by the NNP Resources Institute . For instance , seagrass meadows , salt marshes and mangrove habitats can sequester huge amounts of what NNS call “ blue NN . ” Preserving and restoring them yields other benefits too , IN buffering coastlines from storms and serving as nurseries for economically important fish . Oceans can RB VB by providing NN - friendly foods . As the IPCC ’s last major report on land use pointed out , eating beef and other land - VBN meats is a significant driver of NN NN . But fish is a green alternative . JJ fisheries are already overexploited . But researchers VBP that smart management MD boost yields and be sustainable . “ You can VB more out of the ocean if you just pay attention and manage it properly , ” Matthews VBD . RB so , there ’s no escaping the grim picture painted by the IPCC report . If NN NN continues unabated , “ the consequences for humanity are sweeping and severe , ” Barrett VBD . “ What ’s at stake is the NN of ecosystems , wildlife and — importantly — the NN we leave our NNS . ”"
